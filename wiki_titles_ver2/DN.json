        "title": "Cricket in the United States",
        "text": " \nCricket in the United States is a sport played at the amateur, club, intercollegiate and international competition levels with little popularity, with 200,000 players (&lt;0.1% of the population) across the country. Major League Cricket is the highest level of domestic T20 cricket currently played in America, with T20 being the format of the game that much of the recent growth in American cricket is occurring in.\nIn 2006 it was estimated that 30,000 people in the United States play or watch cricket annually. By 2017, this figure had risen to 200,000 people playing cricket in 6,000 teams. Cricket in the United States is not as popular as baseball and is not as popular among as large a fraction of the population as it is within either the Commonwealth nations or the other ICC full member (or Test cricket) nations. There are at least two historical reasons for the relative obscurity of cricket within the United States. One reason was the 19th-century-rise of the summer time bat and ball sport now called baseball, which has displaced cricket as a popular pastime. Another reason was that in 1909 when the ICC was originally organized as the Imperial Cricket Conference it was open only to Commonwealth nations and thereby excluded the U.S. from participating in the sport at the highest level.\nNevertheless, in 1965 the U.S. was admitted to the renamed ICC as an associate member and the sport grew in popularity in the second half of the 20th century. An oft mentioned reason for the growing popularity of cricket is the growing population of immigrants to the U.S. who come from cricket playing nations.\nWith the launching of the United States Youth Cricket Association in 2010, a more focused effort to bring the game to American schools was begun, with the intention of broadening cricket's fan base beyond expatriates and their children.\nESPN has been stepping up its coverage of cricket in recent years, buying the cricket website Cricinfo in 2007, and broadcasting the final of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 competition, the 2014 Indian Premier League, English County Championship games, and international Test cricket.\nIn 2021, Minor League Cricket, a professional Twenty20 cricket league sanctioned by USA Cricket, began play. Major League Cricket is planning to launch its first season in 2023. In addition, various championships and pathways are being offered for youth cricketers, such as the MLC Jr. Championship.\nHistory.\nCricket was played by British colonists in North America by the start of the 18th century. Archived references to cricket played in America date from 1709. A New York newspaper from 1739 contains an advertisement for cricket players and the first documented competition occurred in 1751 in Manhattan. According to William Byrd II's diary, cricket was played on the slave plantations of Virginia, including on his Westover estate among neighbors and slaves. By 1793, Dartmouth College students were playing cricket on the Green. \nPhiladelphia was the crucible of North American cricket and remains so today. Haverford College formed a cricket team in 1833, generally accepted as the first cricket club exclusively for Americans. Haverford and the University of Pennsylvania formed a strong rivalry, with the first match played on May 7, 1864, believed to be start of the third-oldest intercollegiate sporting contest in America, after the 1852 Harvard-Yale crew and 1859 Amherst-Williams baseball matches. Haverford and Penn then proceeded to play each other for three consecutive years until 1869, when the Haverford faculty banned cricket away from their college grounds. From 1875 and through 1880, Haverford College, Columbia College and University of Pennsylvania fielded a varsity elevens, which played a few matches each year against each other and other club teams.\nIn 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed The Intercollegiate Cricket Association, which Cornell University later joined. During the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed (1881 through 1924) Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship (the \"de facto\" national championship) 23 times (3 shared with Haverford and Harvard, 1 shared with Haverford and Cornell, and 1 shared with just Haverford), Haverford won such championship 19 times (3 shared with Penn and Harvard, 1 shared with Penn and Cornell, and 1 shared with Penn), and Harvard won it 6 times, none after 1899 (3 shared with Haverford and Penn).\nIn July 1895 an international cricket match between Canada and the United States was played on the Manheim grounds in Germantown section of Philadelphia with six of the United States team being Penn student athletes and, in September of that year, past and then current members of Penn's varsity cricket team played past and then current members of the English cricket teams of Oxford and Cambridge resulting in Penn defeating the Oxford-Cambridge team by one hundred runs. This was not surprising as in the last two and a half decades of the 19th century and first decade of the 20th century, Philadelphia was the center of cricket in the United States Cricket had gained in popularity among the upper class from their travels abroad and cricket clubs sprung up all across the Eastern Seaboard (even today Philadelphia still has three cricket clubs: the Philadelphia Cricket Club, the Merion Cricket Club and the Germantown Cricket Club).\nThe eleven-person team cricket familiar with Americans today took root most effectively at the St. George's Cricket Club, founded in 1838. Clubs from the United States (St. George's CC) and Canada participated in one of the first international cricket matches on record in 1844 in Bloomingdale Park in Manhattan. Cricket received a significant amount of media coverage at the time. In the mid-19th century, the sport was played in approximately 125 cities in 22 states. Roughly 500 officially established clubs existed and it is probable that in 1860 there were 10,000 boys and men in America who had actively played the sport for at least a season.\nSt. George's CC employed Sheffield native Samuel Wright as its professional cricket playing groundsman. Wright's two sons, Harry and George, played for the United States XXII against the All England XI in 1859 in New York and Philadelphia. Both Wright brothers became renowned in baseball circles after they played for the Cincinnati Red Stockings, America's first professional baseball team. English cricket teams toured American regularly. Richard Daft's England side visited in 1869, when they played in New York and Philadelphia. Then with the spread of cricket to Boston, Lord Hawke's England XI played George Wright's New England Cricket XI at the Longwood Country Club in Boston. On the same tour in 1891 Lord Hawke's XI defeated a Germantown CC XI in Philadelphia, which included George Patterson, regarded as America's best batsman, with several centuries to his credit. George Patterson – referred to as America's W.G. Grace – was an American-born cricketer and lawyer by profession, described as brilliant under pressure when facing first-class English sides.\nGoverning bodies.\nThe United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) previously served as the governing body for cricket in the United States, as an associate member of the ICC from 1965 to 2017. The USACA faced turmoil and governance issues in the 2000s and early 2010s. In 2005 the USACA was suspended from the ICC's annual conference due to issues with the association's election process, but that suspension was lifted in March 2006. In February 2006, a competing commercial body, Major League Cricket (MLC), proposed that it replace the USACA as the United States' representative in the ICC, citing its more substantial efforts in developing the sport in the country (especially at grassroots levels such as schools, which the USACA had ignored), and accused the USACA of having \"the morbid opinion that they do not need any outside assistance whereas the development of the game.\"\nThe USACA was suspended by the ICC in 2007 for its failure to adopt a constitution and hold elections in a timely manner, and the U.S. team pulled out of the World Cricket League Division Three. The organization was suspended once again in 2015, citing \"significant concerns about the governance, finance, reputation and cricketing activities\" of the organization. However, the U.S. team was still allowed to continue competing in events such as the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, with ICC Americas serving as an interim caretaker of its cricket operations. In 2017, the ICC voted to expel the USACA, citing its increasing debt and failure to ratify a certified constitution.\nIn January 2019, a new body known as USA Cricket was approved as a new associate member of the ICC, replacing the USACA as the United States' representative.\nNational teams.\nMen's team.\nIn 2018, the U.S. men's team was promoted to Division Two of the World Cricket League for the first time. In 2019, the United States qualified for the inaugural season of its replacement, the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, whose top teams will move on to the qualifier for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. On November 16, 2021, the ICC announced that the United States and West Indies would co-host the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup. It will be the first ICC World Cup tournament to feature matches played in the United States - with three venues finalized in New York, Florida &amp; Texas.\nIn December 2021, the United States hosted Ireland in a T20I and ODI series, which marked the country's first-ever home series against a Test-playing nation. The two teams split the T20 series. However, the ODI series was cancelled due to COVID-19 issues.\nWomen's team.\nIn November 2021, the United States won the 2021 Women's T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier, advancing to the global qualifier for the 2023 Women's T20 World Cup.\nDomestic competitions.\nThere have been various attempts at domestic cricket leagues in the United States: Pro Cricket was formed in 2004 as a commercial cricket league not sanctioned by the ICC, which played a modified T20 format with changes intended to further increase the pace of the game, including five-ball overs. The USACA, later in partnership with New Zealand Cricket, proposed a T20 competition known as the American Premier League, patterned after competitions such as the Indian Premier League. It was announced in 2009, but never came to fruition. The American Twenty20 Championship was later held in 2011 as a three-day event in New Jersey between regional teams, to help develop and promote American players.\nVia the investment arm American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), USA Cricket has sanctioned the domestic T20 league Minor League Cricket, and plans to launch the professional competition Major League Cricket (no relation to the aforementioned organization) in 2023.\nInternational Competitions.\nOn November 16, 2021, the International Cricket Council announced that the United States along with the West Indies will co-host the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, making the first ICC World Cup Tournament to take place in the United States. \nCricket grounds.\nThere are only a few purpose-built cricket grounds in the United States, they include the Germantown Cricket Club Ground\nand the Philadelphia Cricket Club Ground in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Randolph St. George Walker Park on Staten Island, New York; the Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill, Florida; and the Leo Magnus Cricket Complex in Van Nuys, California.\nThe Indianapolis World Sports Park in Indianapolis, Indiana, which features cricket grounds, was completed in 2014, and hosted the USACA's national championship that year.\nThe game is also played on a number of shared purpose venues, they include Van Cortlandt Stadium in Bronx, New York and others.\nIn 2021, American Cricket Enterprises leased AirHogs Stadium, the home field of the defunct Texas AirHogs baseball team, to redevelop it as a cricket-specific stadium and USA Cricket training facility. The revamped stadium was completed in 2023 and it was named as Grand Prairie Stadium.\nThe main cricket grounds in the United States include:\nCricket in American culture.\nIn 2006 it was estimated that 30,000 people in the United States play or watch cricket annually. By 2017, this figure had risen to 200,000 people playing cricket in 6,000 teams. Cricket in the United States is not as popular as baseball and is not as popular among as large a fraction of the population as it is within either the Commonwealth nations or the other ICC full member (or Test cricket) nations. There are at least two historical reasons for the relative obscurity of cricket within the United States.

In addition, USA Cricket has begun offering various championship tournaments for youth cricketers, such as the MLC Jr. Championship.\nESPN has been stepping up its coverage of cricket in recent years, buying the cricket website Cricinfo in 2007, and broadcasting the final of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 competition, the 2014 Indian Premier League, English County Championship games, and international Test cricket.\nToday, cricket in the United States is mostly played by those with heritage in countries where cricket is popular. As of 2022, all members of the United States national cricket team were either born in countries which play Test Cricket, or were born in the U.S. to parents from such countries. \nDespite its lack of popularity, it is not uncommon to find clubs with a long history and a lineage dating back to the early 20th century."

It is the second AMF Bowling game on the Wii after AMF Bowling Pinbusters!\nGameplay.\nIn \"AMF Bowling World Lanes\", the player uses the Wii Remote to bowl bowling balls in games played against the AI. When preparing to bowl a ball, the player can choose to throw the ball several seconds after their character has walked up to the line during their approach. The game comes with several characters that players can use and locations where players can bowl. There is also a guy called George with a long beard who you can play as only after bowling 3 perfect games. Characters include a Scottish person that wears a kilt who bowls with his plaid ball and a Brazilian soccer player who bowls with a black and white ball. \"AMF Bowling World Lanes\" also contains several bowling mini-games.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was announced in April 2008.\nReception.\nThe game received an aggregated score of 25% at Metacritic. \"AMF Bowling World Lanes\" was given a score of 2.5 of 10 from video game critic website IGN. Their review criticized the graphics, asking \"if you're going to sell a bowling game, put some effort into making it close to Wii Bowling. Please,\" and calling the graphics for the characters and locations \"flat out bad\". They were also disappointed with what they considered character one-liners that emphasized unnecessary stereotypes, along with poor controls which they believed made the game more difficult to control. IGN compared \"AMF Bowling World Lanes\" to the bowling component of \"Wii Sports\" several times, noting, \"it's still not anywhere close to the quality of Wii Sports Bowling, a free game included with every Wii system in North America.\""

A right-hander, he played in all or parts of three seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Athletics (–, ) and Cleveland Indians (1951). Listed as tall and , Harris was born in Sulligent, Alabama; he graduated from Jones Valley High School and attended the University of Alabama.\nHarris' pro career began at the age of 17 in the low minor leagues. He appeared in 51 games in 1943 and 1944 before entering the United States Navy for World War II service. Acquired by the Athletics in 1947, he made his major league debut the following season, when, on April 29, 1948, he retired the Boston Red Sox in order during the eighth inning of the Red Sox' 11–5 victory at Shibe Park. Harris went on to lead the first-division Athletics in games pitched with 45—all of them as a reliever—and tied for the team lead in saves (then an unofficial statistic), with five. He posted a 5–2 won–lost record and a 4.13 earned run average in 93 innings pitched; all would be career bests. In 1949, Harris' effectiveness diminished and his production fell off: in 37 games, he split two decisions, had three saves, and saw his ERA rise to 5.44.\nHarris then spent 1950 back in the minor leagues before a brief return to the majors in early 1951, working in three games for Philadelphia and two for Cleveland before rosters were cut from 28 to 25 men in mid-May. His minor league career continued into 1956. As a big-leaguer, Harris won six of nine decisions with eight saves and a 4.84 career ERA. In 87 games, all of them in relief, he permitted 190 hits and 86 bases on balls in 186 innings pitched. He struck out 53. He died in Nobleton, Florida, at the age of 86."

National League Three would be made up of British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA) teams wishing to play in the summer whilst National League Four would have been made up of clubs from the Rugby League Conference. . Promotion and relegation between National League Three and the semi-professional National League Two would have been gradually introduced. However, due to an insufficient number of applicants, National League Four was never founded.\nIn the end, a ten team National League Three was founded, with six coming from the Rugby League Conference (Teesside Steelers, Manchester Knights, Coventry Bears, Hemel Stags, St Albans Centurions and South London Storm, four from the National Conference League (Bradford Dudley Hill, Sheffield Hillsborough Hawks and Warrington Woolston Rovers) and Huddersfield Underbank Rangers from the Pennine League). The league was split into two regions with sides playing everyone in their region twice and those outside once except for one cross-region team they played twice giving 14 fixtures with no promotion to National League Two.\nThe 2004 season saw an expansion to fourteen teams with Birmingham Bulldogs, Carlisle Centurions and Essex Eels elected from the Rugby League Conference. Bramley Buffaloes, were admitted after the demise of the professional Bramley club. Gateshead Storm also entered as late replacements for the defunct Teesside Steelers. The season was extended to twenty games starting a move towards a full season. Manchester Knights resigned from the league a few games before the end of the season.\nThe league was reduced back to 10 teams for the 2005 season. South London Storm joined the new Conference South Premier Division and Manchester Knights entered the Rugby League Conference Central Premier. The league went to a round robin 22 game home-and-away setup. Carlisle Centurions and Birmingham Bulldogs failed to complete the season, while Coventry Bears and Essex Eels resigned after the season and reentered the Rugby League Conference. \nAhead of the 2006 season Dewsbury Celtic entered from the Conference Central Premier and Featherstone Lions, just a month after failing to finish the season in the National Conference League, were accepted to National League Three to keep the number of teams to ten. A few weeks into the season Sheffield Hillsborough Hawks withdrew, Bradford Dudley Hill despite making the playoffs opted to return to the National Conference League and St Albans Centurions decided to join the Rugby League Conference Premier South Division, which left Hemel Stags as the only South of England team in the league.\n2007-2011: Rugby League Conference National Division.\nIn 2007 the National League Three was abolished with the remaining seven club entered into the Rugby League Conference, creating a new league; the Rugby League Conference National Division which would be the top level of amateur summer rugby. Three teams from the Conference North Premier (Leeds Akkies, Cottingham Phoenix and East Lancashire Lions) were entered. \nThe new National Division was much more based around the North of England with Hemel the only team based in the South. A largely Naorthen based league saw far less resignations than its predecessor with only Cottingham Phoenix being expelled at the end of the 2007 season.\nIn 2008, Super League team, Crusaders entered their academy team after missing the deadline for entering the reserves league. Liverpool Buccaneers also joined the league while Leeds Akkies dropped down to the Conference Premier North. Bramley finished top of the league but the Colts won the Grand Final. During this season there were no withdrawals from the league and like the previous season a high fixture fulfilment rate.\nIn 2009, the league saw its first significant expansion since its rebrand in 2007, with Nottingham Outlaws entering for the first time and Carlisle Centurions returning to the league while Celtic Crusaders Colts joined the Super League Reserve grade.\nAfter winning the Yorkshire Premier title in 2009, Kippax Knights enter red the National Fivision in 2010 while Gateshead Storm resigned to merged with Newcastle Knights in the North East league and East Lancashire Lions taking a season’s sabbatical to secure a new home base (they resurfaced as Accrington &amp; Leyland Lions in the North West Premier Division in 2011). Carlisle Centurions and Liverpool Buccaneers failed to complete the season in 2010.\n2011 was the National Leagues final season. Coventry Bears rejoined the competition for its final season and Welsh Champions Valley Cougars entered. Gateshead Thunders reserve team, Gateshead Lightening intended to enter but they failed to start the season.\n2012: Merger with National Conference League.\nIn 2011, members of the National Conference League voted to switch to play from winter to summer. This meant both major amateur competitions would be playing at the same time of year. \nIt was decided that the Rugby League Conference would be abolished and replaced by four summer regional leagues; Cumbria League, North West League, North East League and Yorkshire League.\nThe RLC National League would become the fourth tier of the National Conference League being rebranded as NCL Division Three.\nThe new division was a one season trial to see how amateur clubs coped with traveling with NCL Division Three being the most geographically spread league in the NCL. During the 2012 season there would be no promotion due to minimum standards.\nAhead of the new season Dewsbury Celtic and Featherstone Lions rejoined the National Conference League in Division Two, with the eight remaining clubs being joined by two clubs, Bristol Sonics and St Albans Centurions, stepping up from the Confernce Premier. Valley Cougars dropped back to the Welsh League after the teams were announced and were replaced by South Wales Hornets (a feeder club for South Wales Scorpions. Despite finishing top of the league, Huddersfield Underbank Rangers were beaten 17-10 by Hemel Stags in the Grand Final.\nAt the end of the season it was announced Division Three would not continue in the same format. Winners, Hemel Stags were elevated to the professional Championship 1, while Coventry Bears, Huddersfield Underbank Rangers and Nottingham Outlaws were among nine clubs invited to join the new-look National Conference League. Nottingham Outlaws opted to join Conference League South along with Bristol Sonics and St Albans Centurions. After not being invited to continue in the NCL, Bramley Buffaloes and Kippax Knights dropped into the Yorkshire Men's League. Warrington Wizards merged with Woolston Rovers and applied for the National Conference League while South Wales Hornets folded."

He was a left-handed pitcher who appeared in 11 Major League games over two seasons, pitching in three games for the Milwaukee Braves in and eight games for the Cleveland Indians in . The native of Kenosha, Wisconsin, stood tall and weighed .\nHartman signed with his home-state Braves after graduation from Kenosha High School and began his minor league career in 1955. Three years later, he won 20 of 30 decisions for the Double-A Atlanta Crackers, tying for the Southern Association lead in wins and making the league's All-Star team. The following season, with the Triple-A Louisville Colonels, Hartman had another fine season, with a 10–3 win–loss record, and was recalled to the Braves for one game in April and two more in June. He worked in three losing efforts in middle relief and was ineffective in two of them, allowing six hits, five earned runs and two bases on balls in only 1 innings pitched.\nHe returned to the Braves' farm system until June 24, 1962, when he was recalled from Louisville and traded to the Indians for infielder Ken Aspromonte. Two days later, he made his first Major League start against the Detroit Tigers in the second game of a twi-night doubleheader. Hartman lasted ten innings, allowed only three hits and one earned run with seven strikeouts, but left for a pinch hitter with the game tied, 1–1. Relief pitcher Gary Bell worked the next two innings and got credit for a 3–1 Cleveland win.\nLater against the Chicago White Sox, Hartman started well with one run allowed in four innings, but in the fifth, he faced four batters and could not record an out, as Chicago scored three earned runs. Hartman made six more appearances as a relief pitcher for Cleveland in July 1962 before returning to the minor leagues, retiring in 1963 after nine professional seasons.\nAs a Major Leaguer, he allowed 20 hits and ten bases on balls, with 12 strikeouts, in 19 innings pitched."

It was the first time that the Biathlon World Championships were held in Asia (outside Asian Russia).\nThere were a total of 11 competitions: sprint, pursuit, individual, mass start, and relay races for men and women, and the relatively new mixed relay. All the events during these championships also counted for the 2008–09 Biathlon World Cup season.\nChampionship highlights.\nBefore the championships even started there was controversy with three Russian biathletes being sent home for having failed drugs tests during a previous round of the World Cup in Ostersund, Sweden. Then the first day's competition was only made possible after the efforts of over 500 volunteers, working overnight managed to re-lay the competition tracks with man-made snow after all the natural snow had disappeared after unusual weather conditions melted it all away.\nThe events themselves started with a victory for Kati Wilhelm in the women's sprint and an extraordinary 1,2,3,4 for Norway in the men's sprint with Ole Einar Bjørndalen coming out on top.\nDrama started on the second day with reigning champion, Andrea Henkel disqualified before the women's pursuit even started after she accidentally loaded her rifle with live ammunition and fired a round during a pre-race practice, leaving Helena Jonsson from Sweden to capture a surprise gold medal, moving into the medal positions from fifth place only after shooting clear on the final shoot.\nThen during the men's 12.5 km pursuit, 15 competitors at least, including race leader and eventual winner Ole Einar Bjørndalen, skied the wrong way at the start of the first lap. Just after leaving the start, the athletes skied over a bridge instead of around it, which was a course change from the previous day's sprint competition. Following a complaint from the Russian team, a race jury gave nine athletes a one-minute time penalty, relegating Bjørndalen from first to the bronze medal position and awarding the gold medal to the Russian Maxim Tchoudov. However, a counter complaint by seven other member states led to the Appeal Jury reverting to the original result. It was a record 12th World Championship gold medal for Bjørndalen. Because the world championships count towards the World Cup, the win was Bjørndalen's 86th victory, equaling the winter-sport record of 86 World Cup victories by Swedish Alpine skier Ingemar Stenmark.\nThe men's individual saw another victory for Bjørndalen, taking his tally of World Cup victories to 87, and breaking Stenmark's record that had stood since 1989. The women's individual saw Wilhelm win her second gold medal of the Championships.\nThe relay events started with the mixed relay event and in a very close competition France, Sweden and Germany were within 10 seconds of each other at the final change over with France coming out on top to win their first title in this event.\nThe mass start for men saw Bjørndalen going for his 4th victory of the championships, and into the last shooting stage he was comfortably in the lead but then with 2 shots missed, Dominik Landertinger and Christoph Sumann from Austria and Ivan Tcherezov from Russia were able all get within 5 seconds of him. On the last skiing lap Landertinger was able to ski quickest, securing Austria their first medal of the championships, with Bjørndalen having to settle for fourth. The women's relay was won by Russia with an impressive margin over Germany with France taking bronze.\nThe women's mass start was a close-run race with 4 women battling it out for gold after the final shoot, with Olga Zaitseva coming home comfortably at the end. Kati Wilhelm, wearing bib one, had been expected to contend for gold having already collected 2 gold medals earlier in the championships but after missing 7 targets she came home last. The men's relay brought the championships to a close with another close race with Austria, Norway and Germany all in contention right up the final standing shoot of the final leg. Bjørndalen on the anchor leg for Norway shot clear whereas Sumann missed one target and the Norwegian had enough in him to ski his country to gold, collecting his fourth gold of the championships in the process.\nSchedule.\nThe provisional schedule of the event is below."

Mississippi State chose not to accept previous bids because state officials viewed African-Americans as inferior and would not allow Ole Miss or Mississippi State to play against teams with African-American players. The 1963 team, however, famously snuck out of the state in the dead of night to play in what has since been dubbed the \"Game of Change\".\nSix of the ten NCAA appearances have been earned in the past 10 seasons under former MSU Head Basketball Coach, Rick Stansbury. They have won 10 conference championships, four as a member of the now-dissolved Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1912, 1913, 1914, and 1916 in addition to six SEC titles in 1959, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1991, and 2004.

More surprising as Jones had been suspended in August 1922 by the Welsh Rugby Union for encouraging younger players to switch codes from rugby union to the professional rugby league game. This decision was later over-turned and Jones was allowed to play rugby union again. Jones played two more games for Wales, the first against England saw him record his first international points when he scored a try, though this was not enough to prevent an English victory, Wales losing 17-9.

        "text": "Oklahoma State Cowboys baseball is the NCAA Division I varsity intercollegiate baseball team of Oklahoma State University, based in Stillwater, Oklahoma, United States. The team competes in the Big 12 Conference. The Cowboys' current head coach is Josh Holliday. \nOklahoma State is a historically elite program, with the fifth-best win percentage, 14th-most wins, sixth-most College World Series wins, sixth-most College World Series appearances, and fourth-most NCAA Tournament appearances in college baseball history, as of June 14, 2021. The program has accumulated a better all-time win percentage and more wins, regular season conference championships, conference tournament championships, All-Americans, NCAA Tournament appearances, NCAA Tournament wins, College World Series appearances, College World Series Finals appearances, College World Series wins, and College Baseball Hall of Famers than any school in the Big 12 besides Texas. Oklahoma State has won 25 conference championships and 25 conference tournament championships as of the end of the 2023 season. The Cowboys have also earned 48 NCAA Tournament bids and have played in 20 College World Series, including a still-standing NCAA record seven straight CWS appearances from 1981 to 1987.\nThe Cowboys have four players/coaches in the College Baseball Hall of Fame: Gary Ward (who coached the program to 16 consecutive conference titles from 1980 to 1996), Tom Borland (1955 College World Series Most Outstanding Player), Pete Incaviglia (the all time home run king in college baseball history), and Robin Ventura (holder of an NCAA record 58-game hitting streak and widely regarded as the greatest hitter in college baseball history). \nOklahoma State won the national championship in 1959, led by star pitcher Joel Horlen, who would later author the 12th no-hitter in Chicago White Sox history in 1967. Former OSU pitcher Allie Reynolds also threw two no-hitters with the New York Yankees in 1951, which is still tied as an MLB record for most no-hitters in a single season by one player. Former Cowboy pitcher John Farrell managed the Boston Red Sox to two World Series championships in 2007 and 2013.\nHistory.\n1959 national championship.\nThe 1959 Cowboys baseball team entered the season not expected to do much. Only four players, left fielder Don Soergel, and pitchers Roy Peterson, Joel Horlen, and Dick Soergel, were on the roster from the previous season. The preseason prospectus for 1959 read, \"The baseball outlook for coach Toby Greene's 16th edition of Cowboy baseball is quite questionable. Despite the return of key members from last year's pitching staff, it's hard to consider the Pokes much of a threat with graduation, grades and the pros robbing the veteran OSU mentor of all but one of his starters.\" The team compiled a 17–3 conference record, winning the Big Eight conference title.\nOSU opened the 1959 national tournament with a 10–2 victory over Western Michigan behind a Joel Horlen five-hitter. They had to rally for three runs in the seventh in its next game against Penn State and won 8–6 with eleven team hits. In their next game, the Cowboys lost to Arizona by a score of 5–3, as Soergel lost his first career game in twelve decisions. In the losers bracket, the Pokes found themselves down 3–2 in the ninth, but scraped across two runs to earn the 4–3 victory. A Fresno State victory over Arizona that night left three teams with one loss each. Arizona won the coin toss and became the odd man out as Oklahoma State and Fresno State met for the chance to play the Wildcats for the national championship. The Cowboys beat the Bulldogs 4–0 to advance to the championship game.\nIn the championship game, Jim Dobson, who was voted the Most Valuable Player, opened the O-State scoring with a towering home run over the left-field fence in the fourth inning. Arizona picked up single runs in the fourth and fifth and led 2–1. Bancroft tied the score with a solo home run in the top of the sixth, but the Wildcats added a run of their own in the bottom of the sixth to lead 3–2. It was another sophomore, Bruce Andrew, who sparked the game-winning three-run rally in the top of the seventh, and OSU led 5–3. Soergel shut out the Wildcats in the final three innings and OSU had its first NCAA Baseball Championship.\nFour Cowboy players were named to the College World Series All-Tournament team, including third baseman and MVP Dobson. Also selected were Bruce Andrew at second base, Connie McIlvoy in the outfield and Horlen at pitcher.\nFacilities.\nThe Cowboys planned to open the new O'Brate Stadium, located one block northwest of the team's current home of Allie P. Reynolds Stadium, on March 20, 2020 for the Cowboys' Big 12 opener against TCU. The Cowboys played their first 11 of a planned 14 home games of the 2020 season at Reynolds Stadium. Named for major donor Cecil O'Brate, the new ballpark has a permanent capacity of 3,500 but is expandable to 8,000.\nReynolds Stadium is named after the former OSU player Allie Reynolds, who went on to play professionally for the Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees. The park, with a capacity of 3,821, opened in 1981 at a cost of $2.2 million.\nRivalries.\nOklahoma Sooners.\nOklahoma State's series against Bedlam rival Oklahoma has featured more games played than any other OSU baseball series. As of the end of the 2021 season, the Cowboys lead the overall series with the Sooners 179–155 and hold a 56–40 lead in games played since the inception of the Big 12. Oklahoma State has dominated the rivalry in recent years, winning 23 of 30 contests since 2013, head coach Josh Holliday's first season.\nPlayer awards.\nThe following Cowboys were given the following awards, as voted on by the American Baseball Coaches Association, Baseball America, Collegiate Baseball, the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association, and Sporting News:\nHall of Fame.\nThe Oklahoma State Cowboy baseball program has produced four National College Baseball Hall of Famers, who were inducted in the first three years of its existence. Oklahoma State baseball has its own Hall of Fame, in which players and coaches have been inducted."

        "text": "The Kent State Golden Flashes baseball team is a varsity intercollegiate athletic team of Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, United States. The team competes at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a member of the Mid-American Conference. The head coach is retired Major League Baseball player Jeff Duncan, who was hired in June 2013.\nBaseball was established at Kent State in 1914 and the team was known as the \"Normal Nine\". It is the second-oldest athletic team at Kent State University after the men's basketball team. Kent State began play in the Mid-American Conference in 1951, winning their first conference title in 1964 and making their first appearance in the NCAA tournament. Through the 2023 season, the Flashes have won 16 Mid-American Conference regular-season titles, 12 MAC tournament titles, 12 MAC East division titles, and have made 14 NCAA tournament appearances. The 2012 season marked the team's first appearance in the College World Series.\nHome games are held at Schoonover Stadium, the team's home field since 1966. The stadium, previously known as Gene Michael Field, was renovated in 2005 and received additional upgrades in 2007, 2008, and 2013. Additionally, the Flashes have an indoor practice facility, the David and Peggy Edmonds Baseball and Softball Training Facility, which opened in 2014. Kent State has produced a number of players who have gone on to play professionally at the Major League level, including Thurman Munson, Andy Sonnanstine, Emmanuel Burriss, and Dustin Hermanson.\nHistory.\nThe team was established in 1914 at the new Kent State Normal School, which was established in 1910 and had its first classes in 1912 at temporary locations. The new campus opened in May 1913. The team is the second intercollegiate athletic team at Kent State, formed just after the men's basketball team, which was established in late 1913. H.E. Nickerson served as manager and William Brown was captain of that first team in 1914. No records of any games are available, though a photo of that team, labeled as the \"Ex Temporé Base Ball Team\", exists from that season. The following year, the \"Normal Nine\", coached by school custodian Alexander Whyte, played their first recorded intercollegiate games, opening the season with a 7–6 win over Baldwin Wallace College in Kent. The team finished 1–3 that season and games were held on an informal field in front of the campus, which is now largely occupied by Rockwell Hall. Alf Lovall coached the team to a 1–2 record in 1916 and Paul Chandler led the team to a 3–0 record in 1922. The records for the 1917–21 and 1923–25 seasons are incomplete, though it was during the 1923 season that the various Kent State Normal College teams began being referred to as the Silver Foxes. The team also began play at Rockwell Field around 1920, their home field through the 1941 season.\nIn 1927, the current \"Golden Flashes\" name debuted and Merle Wagoner, who also coached the football team from 1925–32, became the Flashes' first long-term coach from 1926–33 leading Kent State to a record of 27–34 in his eight seasons. The Flashes were coached by Gus Peterka for the 1934 and 1935 seasons, Donald Starn for the 1936–1938 seasons, and John Starrett for the 1939–1942 seasons leading up to World War II. During the war years, 1943–1945, Kent State did not field any varsity athletic teams, but resumed in 1946. Wesley Stevens served as head coach for 1946 and 1947 before Matt Resnick took over in 1948. He served as Kent State's coach for the longest tenure to date, from 1948 through the 1961 season compiling an overall record of 132–100–1 and 50–50 in the Mid-American Conference.\nMid-American Conference.\nKent State joined the Mid-American Conference in 1951 and baseball began play in the conference in early 1952, finishing third with a 5–4 record in MAC play. Under Matt Resnick, the Flashes reached third place in 1959 with an 8–3 conference record and second place in Resnick's final season in 1961 with a conference record of 9–2. Dick Paskert took over beginning in 1962 and guided the Flashes to their first MAC regular-season title in 1964 finishing in a tie with the Ohio Bobcats at 10–1. Kent State defeated the Bobcats 6–3 in a playoff game for the Flashes' first NCAA tournament berth, where they were eliminated by the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Paskert would coach through the 1971 season with an overall record of 103–116–4 and 45–59–1 in the MAC. During his tenure he coached notable players such as Thurman Munson, Gene Michael, Rich Rollins, and Steve Stone, as well as future college football and NFL coach Nick Saban, who was also a member of the Golden Flashes football team. Art Welch took over the head coaching position from 1972–1981 and was succeeded by Bob Morgan (1982–1983) and Bob Todd (1984–1987) before Danny Hall was hired for the 1988 season.\nDanny Hall.\nDanny Hall coached the Flashes from 1988 through the 1993 season. During his tenure, Kent State won its first MAC championship since 1964 by capturing the 1992 and 1993 regular-season and tournament titles and advancing to the NCAA tournament both years. In the 1992 NCAA tournament regional played in Tallahassee, Florida, the Flashes won their first-ever NCAA tournament game defeating the Georgia Bulldogs 5–2. Kent State fell in their next two games versus Western Carolina University and Florida State to finish 1–2. The Flashes returned to the NCAA regionals the following year playing at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Kent State finished 2–2 that season with wins over eventual national champion Louisiana State and Western Carolina. Hall left after the 1993 season to take the head coaching job at Georgia Tech with an overall record of 208–117 and 106–73 in the MAC at Kent State.\nRick Rembielak.\nRick Rembielak took over the program beginning in the 1994 season, winning the MAC regular-season in his first season and qualifying for the NCAA tournament. During his 11 seasons at Kent State, the Flashes also claimed an overall MAC title in 1996, East Division titles in 2000 and 2003, and MAC tournament titles in 2001, 2002, and 2004. Kent State returned to the NCAA tournament regionals in 2001 at Columbus, Ohio, posting a 2–2 record with wins over host Ohio State and Delaware. The Flashes played in the 2002 and 2004 tournaments, both played at South Bend, Indiana, going 0–2 and 1–2 respectively. Rembielak stepped down after the 2004 season to take the head coaching job at Wake Forest University. He had an overall record at Kent State of 373–251–1 and 200–100 in the MAC.\nScott Stricklin.\nBeginning in the 2005 season, Kent State alumnus Scott Stricklin took over the program after previously serving as pitching coach and recruiting coordinator at Vanderbilt University from 2000–01 and serving as an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator under former KSU coach Danny Hall at Georgia Tech from 2002–04. Under Stricklin, Kent State won six MAC East Division titles (2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012), four MAC regular-season titles (2006, 2008, 2011, 2012), and five MAC tournament championships (2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012). The team has made five trips to the NCAA tournament under Sticklin, including four consecutive from 2009–12. The Flashes earned their first tournament win under Sticklin in the 2009 tournament and advanced to their first regional final since 2001 in the 2011 NCAA Division I baseball tournament with wins over Texas State and host Texas.\nIn 2012, the Flashes won their fourth consecutive MAC tournament title and advanced to the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. The Flashes first won the Gary Regional as the region's third seed with a 3–0 record, which began with a 7–6, 21-inning win over Kentucky in the 2nd longest game in tournament history. The win was followed by a 7–4 victory over host Purdue and a 3–2 win over Kentucky in the regional final. The Flashes advanced to the Super Regional series in Eugene, Oregon, against host Oregon and won the series 2–1 with a series-clinching run in the bottom of the ninth inning of game three. During the series, the team's winning streak reached 21 games before a 3–2 Oregon win in the second game of the series. In the 2012 College World Series, after falling to Arkansas 8–1 in the opener, the Flashes defeated national top seed Florida 5–4. A 4–1 loss to defending national champion and eventual 2012 runner-up South Carolina ended the Flashes' run, giving them a national fifth-place finish. Kent State's appearance in the College World Series marked the first appearance by any Mid-American Conference team since the 1976 Eastern Michigan Eagles and first ever by a MAC team at both the Super Regional round and College World Series since the NCAA tournament expanded to 64 teams. The Flashes were also the first team from the state of Ohio to appear in the College World Series since the 1970 Ohio Bobcats.\nThe Flashes have also continued to have multiple players drafted into the major leagues. In 1994, seven Kent State players were selected in the Major League Baseball draft and the Flashes have had players selected in every draft since 1990 except 1998, including six in 2009, five in 2011, and six in 2012 Through the 2012 season, Stricklin has a record of 314–165 (), which included a program best 47–20 mark in 2012 and a 45–17 record in 2011. He won his 200th game at KSU on April 9, 2010, at Oestrike Stadium in Ypsilanti, Michigan, 16–1 over the Eastern Michigan Eagles. Stricklin's 300th career win came May 14, 2012, with a 10–4 win over the Miami Redhawks in Kent. Following the 2013 season where the Flashes won the regular-season MAC title, Stricklin was hired by Georgia as their head coach. Stricklin's record at Kent State is 350–188 ().\nJeff Duncan.\nJeff Duncan was hired as head coach in June 2013. In his first season, Kent State finished second in the MAC East Division, but won their 11th MAC tournament title with a 3–0 win over arch-rival Akron in the championship game to advance to the NCAA tournament. The following season, the Flashes won their 10th MAC East title, but were eliminated in two games at the MAC tournament. Through the 2015 season, Duncan has an overall record of 65–45 and 34–20 in MAC play.\nPostseason.\nKent State has made 28 appearances in the Mid-American Conference baseball tournament, winning 12 titles through 2023. The tournament was first held in 1981 but discontinued from 1984 through 1991 and again in 2020. The Flashes made their first appearance in the 1992 tournament, which was also their first tournament title, and have qualified for every tournament since then except 2005. From 1981 through 1983 and 1992 through 1997, the tournament included only the top four teams in the conference. It was expanded to six teams in 1998 and eight teams in 2008. After being canceled in 2020 and discontinued for 2021, the tournament was restored for 2022 as a four-team tournament and retains the double-elimination format. During the years the tournament has been hosted by the top seed, Kent State has hosted the tournament eight times through 2023. Through the 2023 tournament, the Flashes' overall tournament record is 72–38 () and their 12 titles are the most in conference history.\nNCAA tournament.\nKent State has participated in the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship 14 times, making their first appearance in 1964 when they hosted the eventual national champion Minnesota Golden Gophers in the regional round. They have qualified automatically as champions of the MAC for every NCAA tournament appearance except 1994, when they were selected as an at-large team. Through the 2018 appearance the team has a 16–29 () record in the tournament. The Flashes have one regional title and one super regional championship, both won in 2012.\nCoaches.\nThrough the 2017 season, Kent State has had 17 head coaches in program history. In the early years of the program, a number of the head coaches also served in the same capacity for another sport, with two coaches serving as head coach for three sports. Alexander Whyte, the head custodian of the school, was also the first head coach of the men's basketball team for two seasons, from 1913–1915. Paul Chandler, who was a professor of education at Kent State, was the first head coach of the football team and coached football for the team's first three seasons (1920–1922) and men's basketball for four seasons (1919–1923) in addition to his duties during the 1922 baseball season. Merle Wagoner, a professor in physical education, was head coach for all three teams—football, men's basketball, and baseball—at the same time for eight seasons from 1925–1933, while Starn coached football for eight seasons (1935–1942) in addition to his three seasons as baseball head coach from 1936–1938.\nThere are no records of teams from 1917 through 1921 due to most male students being involved in World War I. This was repeated from 1943 through 1946 because of World War II. The 1923 and 1924 seasons are mentioned in the Kent State yearbooks, known as the \"Chestnut Burr\", from 1924 and 1925, but no head coach or season results are included. There is no record of the 1925 season in the subsequent 1926 \"Chestnut Burr\".\nFacilities.\nThe Flashes home field is Schoonover Stadium, located on the southern edge of the Kent State campus. The team has played on the field since 1966. From 1990–2003, it was known as Gene Michael Field, named for the Major League Baseball player and manager who is a Kent native and played collegiately for the Golden Flashes. It was renamed for Kent State alumnus Hal Schoonover and his wife Julie in 2003 after the Schoonover Foundation donated $1.53 million to fund renovations. The field is named for local philanthropist Olga Mural after a $1 million donation in 2006. The 2005 renovations included new dugouts, a new scoreboard, replacement of the natural grass field with a FieldTurf playing surface, new bullpens, and a press box. Additional renovations in 2007 added chairback seating to the main grandstand, new restrooms, a concession stand, and a new locker room and player's lounge connected to the home dugout, followed in 2008 by a scoreboard upgrade. Following the team's run to the 2012 College World Series, permanent lights were added for the 2013 season. Prior to the 2014 season, a new parking area was built adjacent to the stadium along with a new entrance. Additional upgrades to the seating area are also planned as of 2015.\nAdjacent to the stadium is the David and Peggy Edmonds Baseball and Softball Training Facility, which was dedicated in October 2014. The building includes a large indoor space with pitching mounds and moveable batting cages and an artificial turf playing surface. A weight room and offices for both the baseball and softball coaching staffs are also located in the facility.\nRivalries.\nThe team's arch-rival is the Akron Zips from the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio. The two teams both play in the Mid-American Conference and are separated by approximately . The series began in 1916 with a 12–1 Akron win in Kent, but did not become a conference game until 1993 when Akron joined the Mid-American Conference. The rivalry unexpectedly ended after the 2015 season when the University of Akron announced the baseball team would be eliminated because of budget concerns. This was later reversed and Akron reinstated the baseball team for the 2020 season. The rivalry was scheduled to resume April 1 with a game in Kent, followed by a rematch April 28 at Canal Park in downtown Akron, the home of the AA-level minor league Akron RubberDucks. The games were canceled in March 2020, along with the remainder of the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the rivalry resumed in 2021, with five games in Kent, where the Flashes took three of five. Through the 2023 season, Kent State leads the series 118–59–1. \nThe Zips and Flashes have met three times in the Mid-American Conference baseball tournament, with Kent State taking two of the three games. The Flashes defeated the Zips 16–3 in their first tournament meeting, a 1995 semifinal game, while the Zips claimed a 4–1 win in the first round of the 1996 tournament. The most recent tournament meeting between the two rivals was the championship game of the 2014 tournament, a 3–0 Kent State win and the only time the two teams met in the tournament final.\nFrom 2007 to 2015, the Zips and Flashes played in the annual Diamond Classic for Kids at Canal Park to benefit Akron Children's Hospital. Leading up to the game, players and mascots from both schools visited children in the hospital, which overlooks Canal Park. The 2007, 2008, and 2009 games were all played in addition to the regularly-scheduled conference series and the game itself was a non-conference game. Beginning in 2010, the game was made part of the 3-game series regardless of which team was hosting in the given year and counted in the conference standings. \nKent State's most frequent opponents through 2022 are long-time MAC rivals, with the Miami RedHawks being the most frequent at 211 meetings, followed by the Bowling Green Falcons at 203 games, and the Ohio Bobcats at 198. The series with Bowling Green began in 1936 and has been a conference game since the Falcons started MAC play in 1953, while Miami and Ohio were members of the MAC when Kent State started conference play in 1952.\nOutside the MAC, the Flashes most common opponent is the Youngstown State Penguins of nearby Youngstown, Ohio, a member of the Horizon League. The two teams meet on a regular basis and typically play at least one game per season at each home field. The Flashes and Penguins have met 95 times, with Kent State holding a 72–22–1 edge in the series after taking the only meeting of 2023.\nKent State also had a regular rivalry with the Cleveland State Vikings that began in 1933 and spanned 88 games. The rivalry ended in 2011 after Cleveland State elected to discontinue their baseball program. Kent State won the final meeting between the two teams 6–2, a game that was a home game for the Vikings, but was played in Kent at Schoonover Stadium due to a rainout and scheduling conflict at the original site.\nAwards.\nAll-Americans.\nThrough the 2016 season, Kent State has had 20 players named as first, second, and third team All-Americans by various collegiate baseball organizations and publications. Two players have been named consensus First Team All-Americans in program history, John Van Benschoten in 2001 and Eric Lauer in 2016. Lauer was also named National Player of the Year by \"Collegiate Baseball Newspaper\" in 2016."

        "title": "San Diego Toreros baseball",
        "text": "The San Diego Toreros baseball team is the college baseball program that represents the University of San Diego. The Toreros compete in NCAA Division I as a member of the West Coast Conference (WCC). The team plays their home games at Fowler Park. \nThe Toreros have appeared in nine NCAA Division I baseball tournaments. As of 2023, 24 USD alumni have played in the MLB, most notably World Series champion Kris Bryant. \nHistory.\nThe team began play in the 1958 season as an independent school in the NCAA College Division, made up of the athletic programs of small universities and colleges. The school, founded in the early 1950s, was then known as the San Diego College for Men, and its athletic programs were known as the Pioneers. Mike Morrow was the program's head coach for its first six seasons (1958–1963), and the team had an 82–64 record during his tenure. In 1961, the school's athletic programs were renamed the Toreros, for the Roman Catholic school's connections to Spain.\nJohn Cunningham era.\nIn 1964, John Cunningham became the program's second head coach. In 1966, the team joined its first conference, the College Division's Southern California Athletic Conference (SCAC). In four seasons in the conference (1966–1969), the team had a conference record of 25–26–1. Prior to the 1970 season, the Toreros left the SCAC to become a College Division Independent again. Also in 1970, the team began playing in a new venue, which would eventually be dedicated to John Cunningham.\nIn 1972, the San Diego College for Men merged with the San Diego College for Women to form the University of San Diego.\nThrough the 1973 season, NCAA institutions had competed in two divisions– the large-school University Division and the small-school College Division. After the 1973 season, however, the NCAA reorganized into its modern, three-division format. The University Division became the modern Division I, while the College Division became Division II and Division III. San Diego, which had previously competed as a College Division Independent, became a Division II Independent.\nAfter five seasons as a Division II Independent, the Toreros transitioned to Division I prior to the 1979 season, joining the Southern California Baseball Association (SCBA). The SCBA, which began play in the 1977 season, was the southern division of a baseball-only merger of the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAC) and the West Coast Athletic Conference (WCAC). The SCBA's counterpart, the Northern California Baseball Association (NCBA), also began play in the 1977 season. San Diego played six seasons in the SCBA, never finishing higher than fourth in the conference.\nThe SCBA and NCBA stopped operating after the 1984 season, and the PCAC and WCAC returned to sponsoring separate baseball conferences. As a result, San Diego joined the WCAC following the 1985 season. Shortly thereafter (following the 1988 season), the conference was renamed the West Coast Conference (WCC). San Diego struggled in its first several seasons in the league, finishing no higher than fourth from 1985–1991. In 1992 and 1993, however, the Toreros had consecutive second-place finishes and consistently finished highly in the 1990s.\nFollowing the 1998 season, John Cunningham retired after 35 seasons. The team's venue had been renamed John Cunningham Stadium in 1988, and Cunningham retired as San Diego's all-time wins leader with 843 wins. Then-San Francisco head coach Rich Hill was hired to replace Cunningham.\nRich Hill era.\nIn 1999, Rich Hill's first season, the WCC split into two, four-team divisions, the West Division and the Coast Division. The Toreros finished third, second, and second in 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. The team then won the West Division and the West Coast Conference Championship Series in both 2002 and 2003, appearing in its first two NCAA tournaments. San Diego again qualified for the tournament in 2006.\nIn 2007, the Toreros had a 43–18 overall record and an 18–3 WCC record. After winning the WCC Championship Series, the team received a berth in the 2007 NCAA Division I baseball tournament as the #8 National Seed. The team hosted a Regional at crosstown rival San Diego State's home ballpark, Tony Gwynn Stadium, but was eliminated after consecutive losses to Fresno State and Minnesota.\nIndividually, in both 2007 and 2008, pitcher Brian Matusz was named a First-Team All-American. Matusz is the only San Diego player to be named to the First Team.\nThe team returned to the NCAA tournament in 2008, 2010, and 2012, but failed to advance out of the Regional round.\nOn June 18, 2021, Hill resigned from his head coaching position to become the head baseball coach at Hawaii.\n2012 MLB draft.\nIn the 2012 Major League Baseball draft, the following four Toreros were selected: P Paul Sewald by the New York Mets (10th round), P James Pazos by the New York Yankees (13th round), OF Bryan Haar by the Minnesota Twins (34th round), and P Calvin Drummond by the Oakland Athletics (38th round). Sewald, Pazos, and Haar signed professional contracts.\nBrock Ungricht era.\nBrock Ungricht joined San Diego as a hitting coach and recruiting coordinator in 2019. Upon long-time head coach Rich Hill's departure at the end of the 2021 season, Ungricht was elevated to the head coach position.\nVenues.\nJohn Cunningham Stadium.\nJohn Cunningham Stadium, located on the university's campus, was the program's home venue from prior to the 1970 season until after the 2012 season. Before the field's 1970 construction, the program had played at several different venues in San Diego. The field had a capacity of 1,200 spectators and was named for former San Diego head coach, John Cunningham, who coached the team from 1964–1998.\nFowler Park.\nBeginning in the 2013 season, the team will play at Fowler Park, built on the location of Cunningham Stadium, which was demolished in summer 2012. Fowler has a capacity of 1,700 spectators that can be expanded to 3,000. The park is named for Ron and Alexis Fowler, who donated much of the stadium's $13 million construction cost. The playing field itself is named Cunningham Field, dedicated to the same coach for whom the program's former venue was named.\nHead coaches.\nThe team's most successful head coach is former coach John Cunningham, who won 843 games from 1964–1998. Also, Cunningham's 35 seasons as head coach make him the longest tenured coach in program history. Rich Hill was the program's head coach from 1999 until 2021.\nYearly record.\nThe following is a list of the Toreros' yearly records since the program began play in 1958."

        "title": "Cal State Fullerton Titans baseball",
        "text": "The Cal State Fullerton Titans baseball team represents California State University, Fullerton in NCAA Division I college baseball.\nAlong with the other CSUF athletic teams, the baseball team participates in the Big West Conference. Since its early days, Titan Baseball has been considered an elite program in college baseball, making 18 College World Series appearances and winning four national championships (1979, 1984, 1995, and 2004). \nThe Titans play their home games on Fullerton's campus at Goodwin Field and are currently coached by Jason Dietrich.\nHistory.\nGeorge Horton era.\nHorton played for Garrido in 1975 and 1976, before beginning his coaching career. Horton began his coaching career immediately after the 1976 season, but left Cerritos College after 1990 to return to Fullerton as an assistant under Garrido. He would remain in that position, until after the 1996 season. When Garrido left Fullerton for the second time, George Horton was named head coach of the baseball program.\nThe Titans finished 39–24–1 in Horton's first year, and 47–17 winning the Big West South title in his second year. Even though he had success in first two seasons, the Titans failed to make it to Omaha. In 1999, Horton led the Titans to their first 50 win season since 1995, and made his first appearance as head coach in the College World Series. The Titans lost their opening round game to Stanford, but bounced back to beat Texas A&amp;M to give Horton his first career win at the CWS. That would be the end of the road though for the 1999 Titans, as they lost their next game to Florida St. and were eliminated from the CWS. Horton would go on to lead the Titans back to Omaha again in 2001 and 2003, but did not reach the championship round.\n2004 national championship.\nIn 2004, Horton and Titans had an up and down regular season, but breezed through conference play. The Titans compiled an overall record of 36–20, including an impressive 19–2 record in conference play. The Titans were awarded a host regional site in the 2004 NCAA Division I baseball tournament and the No. 2 seed at their regional. In regional play, the Titans won their opening round game, but were forced into the loser's bracket after losing to the No. 4 seed, Pepperdine, 7–6. Facing elimination, the Titans beat No. 1 seed Arizona St. 5–0, who was all the No. 7 national seed that year. In the championship round, Fullerton left little doubt, defeating Pepperdine 15–1 and 16–3 to advance to the super regional round of play.\nFullerton hosted Tulane in the super regional round after Tulane won the Oxford regional. Once again, Fullerton completely dominated the games. They advanced to the College World Series after winning, 9–0 and 10–7. In the College World Series, the Titans advanced through the winner's bracket beating South Carolina 2–0 and Miami 6–3. After Carolina advanced through the loser's bracket, they would have to defeat the Titans twice to advance to the championship round. The Gamecocks won the first contest 5–3, but the Titans fought back the next day to win the second game 4–0. Fullerton advanced to the championship round for the first time since winning it all in 1995.\nThe championship round saw Horton face off against his mentor and former Fullerton coach Augie Garrido. Garrido led Texas back to the championship after previously winning it all with the Longhorns in 2002. The Titans won the first game in the best-of-three series, 6–4. On Sunday June 27, 2004, the Titans defeated the Longhorns 3–2 to claim their 4th national title. The Titans finished the season 47–22 overall.\nHorton leaves for Oregon.\nAfter the 2004 national championship, Horton coached the Titans for 3 more season. After the 2007 season, Horton left his alma mater to become head coach of the Oregon Ducks. Oregon did not field a baseball team from 1982 until they played their first game in 2009. Oregon reportedly made Horton one of the highest paid coaches in Division I baseball at the time. Fullerton was left in a similar situation after losing Garrido to Texas after the 1996 season. During his 11 seasons as head coach of the Titans, Horton compiled a record of 490–212–1.\nDave Serrano era.\nAfter losing another great coach to a school that offered a better financial situation, Fullerton was back in the same position it was 11 years earlier. A program that was only 3 years removed from its fourth national title was once again in search of a new head coach. Once again Fullerton went after another former player. In early September 2007, Dave Serrano became just the fourth head coach of the Cal St. Fullerton Titans baseball program. Serrano also played under Augie Garrido during his first tenure as Titans coach, and then followed a similar path as Horton. He began his coaching career at Cerritos College as an assistant, and after a short stint at Tennessee as an assistant George Horton hired him at Fullerton. Serrano became Horton's top assistant and remained in that position until 2004. In 2004, he left Fullerton to become head coach at UC Irvine. After four seasons with the Anteaters, Serrano departed to return to Fullerton. Serrano had just led the Anteaters to their first ever College World Series.\nIn his first year as head coach, Serrano posted a 37–19 mark during the regular season. That mark was good enough to earn the Titans the No. 5 national seed in the 2008 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. After winning the Fullerton regional, the Titans hosted Stanford during the Super Regional round of play. The Cardinals won the first game by a single run, and went on to eliminate the Titans the following day. Overall Serrano posted a 41–22 mark during his first year as head coach of the Titans.\nSerrano's improved on the 2008 season success during the 2009 campaign. Although they finished second in the Big West in 2009, the Titans still finished the regular season with a mark of 42–14. That record was good enough to earn the Titans the No. 2 national seed during the 2009 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. The Titans breezed through the Fullerton regional, winning it in 3 games by scores of 18–2, 7–4, and 16–3. Louisville traveled to Fullerton during the super regional round, and once again Fullerton had no problem with the Cardinals. Fullerton eliminated Louisville in two games with scores of 12–0 and 11–2. Serrano earned his first trip to the College World Series as Titans head coach, and his second overall as a head coach. The Titans failed to meet expectation in Omaha though. They were quickly eliminated losing their first two games. They lost their opening round game to Arkansas 10–6, and lost in an elimination game to Virginia 7–5. The Titans completed the 2009 season with a 47–16 overall record.\nSerrano leaves for Tennessee.\nSerrano was announced as the Tennessee Volunteers baseball head coach on June 15, 2011. He became the 24th head coach of Tennessee baseball, replacing Todd Raleigh. Much like Garrido and Horton, it is believed that Serrano left for a better financial situation. According to reports, Serrano made approximately $140,000 at Fullerton, while Tennessee was reportedly offering around $500,000. During his 4 years as head coach, the Titans compiled a 175–73 record overall.\nRick Vanderhook era.\nOn June 24, 2011, CSUF named Rick Vanderhook head baseball coach, the fifth coach in the program's esteemed history. He played on the Titan's 1984 national championship team and was an assistant coach from 1985–88 and 1991–2007, at which point he departed to become an assistant coach at UCLA. Three years later, Vanderhook accepted the job on a three-year contract at Fullerton. Coach Vanderhook's accomplishments to date include NCAA tournament appearances in almost every year (except 2019) he has been the head coach, the program's second highest single season winning percentage at .836 in 2013, and guiding the 2015 club back to Omaha thus ending a 5-year drought that was the longest lapse in Titans representation at the CWS in 40 years. In 2017, CSUF made its 18th appearance at the CWS, 2nd in the past three years, after winning the Stanford regional and beating Big West rivals CSULB at the Long Beach super regional. Vanderhook retired after the 2021 season.\nGoodwin Field.\nGoodwin Field is a baseball stadium in Fullerton, California named for Jerry and Merilyn Goodwin, who donated $1 million for renovations. It was opened on April 18, 1992 with a two-game sweep of Loyola Marymount.\nYear-by-year NCAA Division I results.\nRecords taken from the Cal.

It is the third on-campus park to serve as the Titans' home field. \nThe second on-campus stadium, Titan Field, was built around 1970 on the site of Goodwin Field, but with home plate located where the left field foul pole is now located. The Cal State Fullerton Titans football team also played at the stadium from 1980 to 1982. \nThe team's first on-campus field, Original Titan Field, was located to the west of Titan House, which is southeast of Goodwin Field. Home plate was laid around 1965 in the southeast corner of a field plowed from citrus groves. \nThroughout the team's history, the Titans also played home games at Amerige Park (1992) and Anaheim's Boysen Park. In 1983, the Titans also played at junior college fields at Fullerton College, Orange Coast College and Santa Ana College during the installation of lights at Titan Field."

The Euroleague Basketball Company used the final four format for the first time in 2002, following the 2001 FIBA SuproLeague Final Four, which was the last final four held by FIBA Europe. In the original FIBA Europe competition, as seen below, the final four was used for the first time at the 1966 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four. The final four format was used again the next year, with the 1967 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four, but was then abandoned.\nThe final four finally returned as the format of choice, for the first time during its modern era, with the 1988 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four. It is known as the Turkish Airlines EuroLeague Final Four for name sponsorship reasons. Panathinaikos has been the most successful team at the EuroLeague Final Four, since the modern final four era began in the 1987–88 season, winning the title 6 times (1996, 2000, 2002, 2007, 2009, 2011). Real Madrid are the most recent winners, having clinched their fifth Final Four title in 2023.\nThe EuroLeague Final Four is broadcast on TV in up to 213 countries and territories.\nHistory.\nHistorical changes.\nThe first time the EuroLeague used a Final Four format to decide its league champion, was at the conclusion of the 1965–66 and 1966–67 seasons, when it held the 1966 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four, and the 1967 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four. Those first two final fours were won by Simmenthal Milano (1966) and Real Madrid (1967). FIBA Europe did not use the final four format again until the 1987–88 season, when it held the 1988 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four, which was also won by Tracer Milano.\nThe EuroLeague Final Four has been held every year since, with FIBA Europe organizing it until 2001, and the Euroleague Basketball Company organizing it since 2002.\nThere were two separate competitions during the 2000–01 season. The SuproLeague, which was organized by FIBA, and the EuroLeague, which was organized by Euroleague Basketball Company. Euroleague Basketball Company's EuroLeague competition, in its inaugural year, used a playoff format, with the two professional teams from Bologna (Virtus and Fortitudo), AEK, and TAU reaching the tournament's semifinals. Virtus was the winner of the 2001 Euroleague Finals."

        "text": "The 2009 British Grand Prix (formally the 2009 Formula 1 Santander British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire, United Kingdom, on 21 June 2009. The 60-lap race was the eighth round of the 2009 Formula One season. It was scheduled to be the last British Grand Prix to be held at Silverstone, before the event moved to Donington Park for the 2010 season. However, due to Donington being unable to raise the required funds the event returned to Silverstone again in 2010, on a new layout. The race was won by Sebastian Vettel, who started on pole, with championship leader Jenson Button finishing in sixth position.\nReport.\nBackground.\nHome driver Jenson Button led the Drivers' Championship by 26 points from Brawn teammate Rubens Barrichello. Barrichello was 8 points clear of Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, who lay 1.5 points ahead of his teammate, Mark Webber.\nBrawn GP led the Constructors' Championship by 39.5 points from Red Bull Racing and were a further 24 points ahead of Japanese manufacturer Toyota.\nHome favourite and reigning World Champion, Lewis Hamilton, had won the previous year's event for McLaren. As well as Hamilton, the British Grand Prix has a history of native success. Down the years these include wins for David Coulthard, Johnny Herbert, Damon Hill, Nigel Mansell, John Watson, James Hunt, Jackie Stewart, Jim Clark and Stirling Moss. Britain was to be represented this year by Hamilton and Jenson Button.\nDue to the continuing political dispute between the Formula 1 Teams Association (FOTA), the FIA and Formula 1 Management (FOM), there was talk that the teams against the proposed 2010 season budget cap would not compete in the 2010 season.\nOther former British GP winners in the field were Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen, Renault's Fernando Alonso and Brawn GP driver Rubens Barrichello.\nPractice and qualifying.\nSebastian Vettel was fastest in both the first and second practice sessions, with Mark Webber coming second in both. The final session saw Nico Rosberg top the time charts.\nQualifying began in some of the coolest conditions experienced all year, with an air temperature of just . The session was mostly dominated by the Red Bull drivers, until a late flying lap by Kazuki Nakajima saw him fastest by a tenth of a second. The session ended prematurely in the final minute when Adrian Sutil crashed heavily at Abbey, forcing reigning World Champion Lewis Hamilton to abort his final lap and leaving him nineteenth with Giancarlo Fisichella, Sébastien Bourdais, Sutil and Sébastien Buemi also eliminated. Sutil's accident was later found to have been a result of brake failure.\nThe second session did not begin until the remains of Sutil's car were removed from the circuit, with track conditions remaining constant and Red Bull continuing their pace, with Mark Webber remaining unchallenged for most of the session with teammate Sebastian Vettel only out-pacing him on his final run. Championship leader Jenson Button only narrowly missed elimination, setting the eight-fastest time at the end of the session when he had previously been sitting eleventh. Felipe Massa, Robert Kubica, Heikki Kovalainen, Nelson Piquet Jr. and Nick Heidfeld were all eliminated.\nThe third and final session saw most of the cars switching to the softer option tyre. Sebastian Vettel took pole from Rubens Barrichello, with Webber third. Button qualified sixth – his worst of the season – after Nakajima found some of his first-session pace to steal fifth place out from under him, resulting in his career-best qualifying position. When the weights of each car was published post-qualifying, it emerged that Vettel was 9 kg heavier than the Brawn of Barrichello and 7 kg heavier than teammate Webber. After qualifying, it was announced that BMW Sauber would be abandoning their KERS program for good.\nRace.\nVettel and Red Bull dominated the Grand Prix, with the young German driving away from the field from pole position, often pulling away from Barrichello at the rate of one second per lap.\nIt was a good day for the Red Bull drivers from the moment the lights went out, with championship rival Button dropping down to ninth position at the end of the first lap after a poor start. Fellow home driver Hamilton was having more success, albeit from 19th on the grid, gaining four positions in the first two laps. The mixed-up race order was perhaps reflective of the season as a whole, with the only World Champions in the field – Raikkonen, Alonso and Hamilton – at one point battling for 13th, 14th and 15th positions.\nAt the front of the race while Vettel was setting fastest laps, teammate Mark Webber was unable to pass Rubens Barrichello for second position until the Brazilian pitted on lap 20. Webber pitted a lap later but produced a good enough in-lap to emerge from the pits ahead of Barrichello. Nico Rosberg also benefited from the pit stop phase, emerging in fourth position, ahead of Felipe Massa.\nHamilton's eventful race at the back of the field continued, running off track on several occasions. He was able to pass teammate Heikki Kovalainen who had just emerged from the pits on lap 34. The following lap, Sebastian Bourdais attempted a similar manoeuvre at the Abbey chicane, however the Toro Rosso driver was less successful, colliding with the Finn and causing both cars to retire.\nAt the second round of pit-stops, Button was able to take advantage of a long middle stint to move ahead of Raikkonen and Trulli and up to sixth position, behind Massa, who had in-turn leap-frogged Rosberg for fourth. Button was on the faster tyre compound and pressured both cars until the finish, but was unable to pass Rosberg despite being just 0.3 seconds behind the German at the start of the last lap. Rosberg was himself just 0.8 seconds behind Massa.\nAs Vettel took the chequered flag, he was 15.1 seconds ahead of teammate Webber, who was a further 25.9 seconds ahead of Barrichello. Jarno Trulli finished in 7th ahead of Raikkonen, who had to endure late pressure from Trulli's teammate Timo Glock. Hamilton finished a lowly 16th.\nPost-race.\nThe combination of the fast sweeping circuit suiting the updated Red Bull RB5 and cold conditions hampering the Brawn produced what was a disappointing result for pace-setting Brawn. Button's championship lead was reduced to a still substantial 23 points over Barrichello, who was now just 2 points ahead of Vettel. Webber was a further 3.5 points behind, while Brawn's Constructors' Championship lead was also cut.\nRed Bull's Christian Horner declared his team could mount a serious title challenge following the successful showing of their updated car, claiming it should be quick on the remaining circuits. Vettel declared his car to be \"fantastic\" while Mark Webber praised the team but admitted a mistake in qualifying cost him any chance of winning. The race also saw Vettel claim his first \"hat trick\", with pole, fastest lap and the win. Button dismissed talk of Red Bull now having a sizeable advantage, saying Brawn looked weaker than they were because of the cool conditions.\nThere were contrasting emotions for 2008 title contenders Felipe Massa and Lewis Hamilton, Massa describing his race from 11th to 4th as good as winning the race while Hamilton said he was pushing his hardest despite finishing 16th.\nAway from the track action, the talk of the paddock was the threat of a breakaway series, with FIA President Max Mosley confident of a solution to the dispute. Commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone admitted for the first time the British Grand Prix would be returning to Silverstone if Donington Park was unable to host the 2010 event.\nClassification.\n\"Cars that used KERS are marked with\" \"‡\""

        "title": "1993 Stanley Cup playoffs",
        "text": "The 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) began after the conclusion of the 1992–93 NHL season on April 18 and ended with the Montreal Canadiens defeating the Los Angeles Kings four games to one to win the Stanley Cup on June 9. These playoffs featured an NHL record 28 overtime games, of which the Canadiens set a playoff record for most overtime games won and consecutively in a single postseason with ten. The Canadiens also won 11 consecutive games during the playoffs, tying an NHL record.\nThe Presidents' Trophy-winning Pittsburgh Penguins, who had won the Stanley Cup the previous two years, were the favourite to repeat. However, both conferences saw numerous upsets as the third place team in every division reached their respective conference finals. This was the first time since the 1979 NHL-WHA merger that the Edmonton Oilers had missed the playoffs. It was also the first time that longtime Oilers and then-New York Rangers captain Mark Messier had missed the playoffs in his career. This was the only year between 1984 and 1994 that the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens did not face each other in the playoffs. This was the last time that the New York Islanders won a playoff round before 2016. It was also the first time in the post-1967 expansion era that no team with a losing record qualified for the playoffs. Montreal's Cup championship remains the last time that a Canadian team won the Stanley Cup.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThis marked the final season of the NHL's division-oriented playoff format (first used in 1982) which saw the top four teams in each division qualify for the playoffs automatically. A similar version of this playoff format was used for the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUnder the rules in place, the following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nDivision semifinals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A1) Boston Bruins vs. (A4) Buffalo Sabres.\nThis was the sixth playoff series meeting between the Sabres and Bruins. Boston won all five previous series head-to-head, including last year's Adams Division Semifinals in seven games. Although Boston had entered the playoffs with the second best record in the entire NHL and the Sabres had the second lowest point total of any playoff team, Buffalo upset the Bruins by sweeping the heavily favored Boston squad. The fourth game saw Brad May's game-winning goal in overtime, which has become famous in NHL lore thanks to Rick Jeanneret's \"May day!\" call. This was the first playoff series victory for Buffalo since defeating Montreal in the 1983 Adams Division Semifinals.\n(A2) Quebec Nordiques vs. (A3) Montreal Canadiens.\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two rivals with the teams splitting the four previous series. This was the final playoff series between the provincial rivals before the Nordiques moved to Denver in 1995 and became the Colorado Avalanche. They last met in the 1987 Adams Division Finals, which Montreal won in seven games.\nThe Canadiens lost the first two games of this series against the rival Nordiques, due in part to a couple of weak goals let in by star Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy. Afterward, a newspaper in Roy's hometown district suggested he be traded, while Nordiques goaltending coach Dan Bouchard also proclaimed that his team had solved Roy. However, Montreal head coach Jacques Demers held himself to a promise he had made to Roy earlier in the season and kept him as the starting goalie.\nWith Montreal staring a potential 3–0 series deficit to Quebec in the face, overtime in Game 3 was marked by two disputed goals that were reviewed by the video goal judge. The first review ruled that Stephan Lebeau had knocked the puck in with a high stick, but the second upheld Montreal's winning goal as it was directed in by the skate of Quebec defenceman Alexei Gusarov and not that of a Montreal player. The Game 3 overtime victory was the first in a record-setting streak of 10 consecutive overtime victories by the Canadiens in these playoffs.\n(P1) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (P4) New Jersey Devils.\nThis was the second playoff series between these two teams. Pittsburgh won the only previous meeting in the 1991 Patrick Division Semifinals in seven games.\nThe two-time defending Stanley Cup champions were a heavy favorite to be the first team since the 1980–1983 New York Islanders to win more than two consecutive Cups. Entering the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winner, the Penguins faced off against the fourth place team from their division the New Jersey Devils. By winning the first three games of the series, Pittsburgh extended its playoff winning streak to 14 games; this dated back to Game 4 of the 1992 Patrick Division Final against the New York Rangers and set an NHL playoff record for longest winning streak. The streak ended in Game 4 when the Devils defeated Pittsburgh, 4–1. The Penguins quickly closed out the Devils in the next game by a score of 5–2 to advance to the second round.\n(P2) Washington Capitals vs. (P3) New York Islanders.\nThis was the sixth playoff series between these two teams. New York previous won four of the first five meetings all from 1983 to 1987. The last of those meetings was won by New York in the famed \"Easter Epic\" in the 1987 Patrick Division Semifinals.\nGame six of this series was marred by a vicious hit by the Capitals' Dale Hunter on the Islanders' leading scorer, Pierre Turgeon, moments after Turgeon had scored a third-period goal to put the game and the series out of reach for Washington. Turgeon suffered a separated shoulder on the play and missed almost all of the next round. For his actions, Hunter was suspended for the first 21 games of the 1993–94 season. This was the Islanders first playoff series victory since their 1987 triumph over Washington.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N1) Chicago Blackhawks vs. (N4) St. Louis Blues.\nThis was the ninth playoff series meeting between these two teams, with Chicago previously winning seven of the prior eight playoff meetings. This was a rematch of the previous year's Norris Division Semifinals, which Chicago won in six games.\nThe Blackhawks became the second division champion after the Bruins to be swept in the first round of the playoffs. On the series-winning overtime goal in game four, Chicago goaltender Ed Belfour complained that St. Louis star Brett Hull had interfered with him on the play, but to no avail, as the goal stood as the game and series winner. Belfour famously went on a rampage after the game, smashing his stick against the net, and breaking a hot tub, coffee maker and a television in the visitors' locker room at the St. Louis Arena. Belfour and Hull later became teammates on the Dallas Stars Stanley Cup winning team in 1999.\n(N2) Detroit Red Wings vs. (N3) Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThis was the 23rd playoff series meeting between these two teams. Both teams split the prior 22 playoff meetings. Detroit won the most recent meeting in six games in the 1988 Norris Division Semifinals.\nIn a revival of the heated Original Six rivalry, Nikolai Borschevsky's game seven overtime goal gave Toronto the series and made them the sixth club to eliminate a team with a better regular season record in the first round of the playoffs. This was also Toronto's first playoff series win over Detroit since the Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in the 1964 Stanley Cup Finals. Until 2009, this was the last Clarence Campbell/Western Conference playoff series to be played entirely within the Eastern Time Zone.\n(S1) Vancouver Canucks vs. (S4) Winnipeg Jets.\nThis was the second overall playoff series between these two teams and was a rematch of last year's Smythe Division Semifinals, which Vancouver won in seven games.\nVancouver managed to defeat the Jets in six games and eliminate them in the first round for a second consecutive year. Game six was not without controversy as Greg Adams scored the first goal for the Canucks, however video replay showed the goal was clearly scored with a high-stick, the goal was allowed to stand. Adams went on to score the game winner in overtime and once again the goal was surrounded with controversy as video replay showed Adams crashing into the net and goalie Bob Essensa. This sent the puck into the net with the back of Essensa's skate. The goal also counted and Jet fans in attendance began to throw debris onto the ice in frustration with the call.\n(S2) Calgary Flames vs. (S3) Los Angeles Kings.\nThis was the sixth playoff series between these two teams. Los Angeles won three of the previous five meetings, including their most recent meeting in six games in the 1990 Smythe Division Semifinals.\nThe Kings upset the Flames in a high scoring six-game series. The winning team scored nine goals in three of the six games. Trailing two games to one and having lost two straight, Kings head coach Barry Melrose inserted backup goaltender Robb Stauber for the struggling Kelly Hrudey, who had allowed 17 goals against in 3 games. Stauber played brilliantly in the Kings 3–1 win in Game 4 as the series was tied at two wins apiece. The Kings offense was largely responsible for winning the series scoring nine goals in both Game 5 and 6.\nDivision finals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A3) Montreal Canadiens vs. (A4) Buffalo Sabres.\nThis was the sixth playoff series between these two teams. Montreal won three of the first five playoff meetings, including their most recent meeting in the 1991 Adams Division Semifinals in six games.\nMontreal swept the series winning every game by a score of 4–3. A pivotal moment came in the second period of Game 3 when Sabres star Alexander Mogilny suffered a badly broken leg, ending what had been a tremendous campaign of 76 goals in 77 regular season games followed by seven goals in seven playoff games. As in their previous series, Montreal played three overtime games, this time winning all three of them.\nThis was the last time where a team who swept a playoff series in the first round was swept in the second round until the New York Islanders suffered the same fate in 2019.\n(P1) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (P3) New York Islanders.\nThis was the third playoff series between these two teams. New York won both previous playoff meetings, including their most recent in the 1982 Patrick Division Semifinals 3–2.\nThe Islanders upset the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions. David Volek's overtime goal in game seven was the deciding goal as New York rallied from a 3–2 deficit to defeat the Penguins. Islanders defenceman Darius Kasparaitis played a large role in his team's win neutralizing Pittsburgh stars Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr with big hits. With their upset of Pittsburgh, the Islanders reached the Wales Conference Finals for the first time since 1984. The Islanders did not win a playoff series again until 2016.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N3) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (N4) St. Louis Blues.\nThis was the fourth playoff series meeting between these two teams. St. Louis won two of the previous three meetings. Their most recent meeting occurred in the 1990 Norris Division Semifinals, which St. Louis won in five games.\nToronto defeated St. Louis in seven games to advance to a league semifinal series for the first time since 1978, despite Blues' goaltender Curtis Joseph's best efforts. St. Louis was heavily outshot throughout the series including more than 60 shots in game one alone. Game 7 of the series was the first Game 7 to be played at Maple Leaf Gardens since game seven of the 1964 Stanley Cup Finals.\n(S1) Vancouver Canucks vs. (S3) Los Angeles Kings.\nThis was the third playoff series between these two teams. Both teams split their first two playoff meetings. Their most recent meeting occurred in the 1991 Smythe Division Semifinals, which Los Angeles won in six games.\nThis was the first Smythe Division Final since 1982 not to have either the Calgary Flames or the Edmonton Oilers. The Vancouver Canucks, who easily won the regular season Smythe Division title, were strong favourites over the Kings. Vancouver's 5–2 win in Game 1 did nothing to change that. Kings head coach Barry Melrose re-inserted Kelly Hrudey as the Kings' starting goaltender in Game 2 and he responded with a strong effort as the Kings evened the series with a 6–3 win. After the teams split the two games in Los Angeles, they headed back to Vancouver for the crucial Game 5. Kings forward Gary Shuchuk scored on a rebound during a goal mouth scramble late in the second overtime and the Kings skated off the ice in front of a stunned Vancouver home crowd with a 3–2 series lead. Back in Los Angeles for Game 6, the Canucks did not recover as the Kings jumped out to a 5–2 lead and won the series despite a late Canuck goal.\nThis was the only time during this era (1982–1993) that a Canadian team did not advance to the Conference Final representing the Smythe Division.\nConference finals.\nAll four conference finalists finished third in their respective divisions during the season.\nPrince of Wales Conference final.\n(A3) Montreal Canadiens vs. (P3) New York Islanders.\nThis was the fourth playoff series between these two teams. Montreal won two of the previous three meetings. New York won the most recent meeting in the 1984 Wales Conference Finals in six games.\nMontreal's win in Game 3 was their 11th straight, tying the single-playoff record set a year earlier by Pittsburgh and Chicago. Montreal added two more overtime victories during the series bringing their total to seven straight for the playoffs.\nClarence Campbell Conference final.\n(N3) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (S3) Los Angeles Kings.\nThis was the third playoff series meeting between these two teams. Toronto won both previous meetings, including their most recent meeting in a two-game sweep in the 1978 Preliminary Round. This was the first conference final for both teams since the playoffs went to a conference format starting in 1982. Toronto last played a semifinal series in 1978; they were swept by Montreal. Los Angeles last played in such a series in 1969; they were swept by St. Louis. For the first time since 1982, this series did not have either the Calgary Flames or the Edmonton Oilers representing the Smythe Division, and it was the only one between then and 1994 not to feature a team from Western Canada.\nDuring game one, Los Angeles defenceman Marty McSorley delivered a serious, open-ice hit on Toronto's Doug Gilmour. Leafs captain Wendel Clark took exception to the hit and went after McSorley for striking their star player. Toronto head coach Pat Burns tried scaling the bench to confront Los Angeles head coach Barry Melrose. After the game, McSorley claimed in the interviews he received dozens of threats on his hotel phone from angry fans. For their part, the Kings believed Gilmour had attempted to head-butt McSorley in retaliation, which would have made Gilmour subject to a game misconduct and a five-minute major penalty, had the butt been called. However, referee Don Koharski declined to do so.\nThe bad blood between the Kings and Gilmour traced back to the game of November 22, 1992, when Gilmour broke the left arm of Kings forward Tomas Sandstrom with a slash, drawing an eight-day suspension and sidelining Sandstrom for over a month. The fires of the feud were fanned by \"Hockey Night in Canada\" studio analyst Don Cherry, who heaped abuse on Melrose throughout the telecast, criticizing everything from his playing style to his haircut, and claimed Sandstrom had \"deserved\" to have his arm broken, for being a \"ChickenSwede\". Later, in a post-game interview, Cherry kissed Gilmour, further angering the Kings.\nToronto took a 3–2 series lead heading into game six in Los Angeles. With the game tied at four in overtime, Wayne Gretzky high-sticked Gilmour in the face, cutting his chin open. As with the alleged head-butt in Game 1, high sticking penalties that resulted in a cut at that time resulted in a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct on the play. However, Gretzky was not penalized by referee Kerry Fraser and went on to score the winning goal moments later evening the series at three games each.\nIn game seven, Gretzky scored a hat-trick and added an assist to give the Kings another 5–4 win and the first Stanley Cup Finals berth in team history. Gretzky later called Game 7 of the 1993 Campbell Conference Finals the greatest game he had ever played. As of the end of the 2023 playoffs, this remains the closest the Maple Leafs have come to winning a Stanley Cup (five wins away) since their last title in 1967.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the first and to date only playoff series between these two teams. The Canadiens had not won a Stanley Cup since 1986. This was the thirty-fourth Finals appearance for Montreal, while Los Angeles made their first ever appearance in the Finals. This was Wayne Gretzky's only appearance in the Finals with the Kings, and the last of his career. Patrick Roy won the Conn Smythe Trophy for the playoffs' MVP. This was the last Finals appearance for Montreal until 2021.\nPlayoff statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played.

        "text": "Kevin Barnes (born September 15, 1986) is a former American football cornerback. He played college football at the University of Maryland. He was selected by the Washington Redskins in the third round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He has also played for the Detroit Lions.\nEarly years.\nBarnes was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on September 15, 1986, and raised in Dunn, North Carolina, but later moved to Glen Burnie, Maryland, where he was raised by parents Kenneth and Debra Hilliard. He attended Old Mill High School, where he played football as a cornerback and wide receiver. Barnes also played basketball and competed in track and field.\nAs a junior in 2002, he recorded ten receptions for 222 yards and four touchdowns. That year, he was named an Associated Press Big School second-team all-state, \"Baltimore Sun\" honorable mention All-Met, and all-county player. As a senior in 2003, Barnes recorded 62 tackles, including 32 solo, three interceptions, and three broken-up passes. That year, he was named an Associated Press Big School all-state, \"Baltimore Sun\" All-Met, and \"Washington Post\" honorable mention All-Met.\nBarnes was named a SuperPrep Mid-Atlantic all-region and PrepStar all-region player. He was not highly recruited, however, and was rated a two-star prospect by Scout.com. Duke and Virginia recruited him before he committed early to Maryland.\nCollege career.\nBarnes redshirted in 2004 and was named the defensive scout team player of the week prior to the NC State and Virginia Tech games. In 2005, he saw action in ten games, mostly on special teams. He recorded four solo tackles and a pass broken up. In 2006, Barnes played in all 13 games including one start, the first of his career, against Florida International. That season, he compiled 11 tackles, which included nine solo.\nIn 2007, he was the first on the team in interceptions with four, second in passes broken up with nine, and fifth in tackles with 65, including 47 solo. He recorded the most interceptions by a Maryland player since Domonique Foxworth in 2002. After the 2007 season, the Terrapins lost three starters in the secondary to graduation, and Barnes stepped in to assume a leadership role during his senior year.\nAs a fifth-year senior in 2008, Barnes played in the first seven games before suffering a shoulder injury. He recorded two interceptions returned for 27 yards, 20 tackles including 15 solo, five passes broken up, seven passes defended, two forced fumbles, and one blocked kick.\nIn the third game of the season, against California, Barnes gained notoriety for the delivery of a hard hit against running back Jahvid Best, an early Heisman Trophy prospect. Late in the second quarter, Cal quarterback Kevin Riley recognized Maryland was in man-to-man coverage. Since he saw there were no safeties in the middle of the field, he threw a short screen pass to Best. Barnes, who had anticipated the play from the snap, immediately delivered a bone-jarring tackle that almost knocked off Best's helmet. While still lying on the field, Best rolled onto his side to vomit. Footage of the hit and its aftermath circulated widely on the internet and became a viral video phenomenon that received 50,000 views on YouTube within a week. After the game, Best said, \"That's probably the hardest hit I've ever taken in my life... It really knocked the wind out of me, and I had a little trouble breathing for the rest of the game.\" When asked if he felt bad about the tackle, Barnes said, \"He's not permanently hurt, so I'm fine with that. Had he died or something, I'd have felt bad, but he'll probably be playing next week.\"\nIn the seventh game of the season, he used his left shoulder to hit Wake Forest wide receiver D. J. Boldin, who was attempting to catch a pass. Barnes suffered a torn glenoid labrum, fractured left scapula, damaged rotator cuff, and broken clavicle. The injury ended his season, and he missed the final six games of his senior year. Barnes later remarked, \"It was my last hit ... Even though I got hurt, it caused a guy to fumble. I've got to look at it that way. I still have [a] smile on my face.\" Despite being unable to play, Barnes remained actively involved with the Terrapins for the rest of the season and took on the role of a student coach. Secondary coach Kevin Lempa said:\"He's another coach out there right now... He's been such an important player for our defense for a long time, and he still wants to help as much as he can. All throughout the game in the pouring rain against NC State, he was talking to the guys on the sideline, so he's like another coach... We all miss having him on the field, but we're glad he's still with us in some capacity.\"\nBarnes received an unusually early invitation to the 2009 Senior Bowl, on September 18, just five days after the game against California in which he tackled Best. He attended, but due to his shoulder injury, could not participate in the game.\nProfessional career.\nWashington Redskins.\n2009 season.\nIn the 2009 NFL Draft, Barnes was selected by the Washington Redskins in the third round as the 80th overall pick. He had participated in the 2009 NFL Combine, where he impressed scouts by scoring highly among cornerbacks in the speed and agility tests. Barnes also scored the highest grade at the combine on the Wonderlic intelligence test with a 41 out of 50, which far exceeded the average prospect's grade of 19. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.52 seconds, which was 0.06 seconds slower than the fastest time record by a cornerback. His vertical jump of 38.5 inches was the sixth-best recorded by a cornerback. Maryland coaches reportedly told Redskins head coach Jim Zorn that Barnes was \"maybe the only guy in that league who could run with wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey,\" who recorded the fastest 40-yard dash time at the combine and was selected seventh overall in the draft.\nZorn also said, \"[We were impressed] when we watched him on video, when we interviewed him and talked to people who knew him.\" Referring to his height and speed, he described Barnes as a leaner version of Carlos Rogers. Unlike some other NFL teams, the Redskins were not concerned about Barnes' injury, and Zorn said his shoulder \"was repaired... He's not going to have a problem at all.\" His mother is an avid fan of the Dallas Cowboys, the Redskins' biggest rivals. Barnes himself said, \"The first team I liked was the Cowboys, so how ironic that I would go to the Redskins, but I love to be a Redskin.\" After summer minicamp, the Redskins signed Barnes to a four-year contract with a $782,000 signing bonus. Regarding his offseason performance, the club's executive vice president, Vinny Cerrato, said, \"It was like a light came on, so Kevin was just playing instead of thinking all the time... He had four interceptions and was really breaking on the ball.\" Barnes was expected to compete with Justin Tryon for the fourth cornerback position on the depth chart.\n2010 season.\nIn camp before the 2010 season, Barnes and veteran cornerback Phillip Buchanon out-performed Tryon, who was eventually traded to the Indianapolis Colts. At the start of the season, with Zorn replaced by Mike Shanahan as head coach, Barnes and linebacker Brian Orakpo were the only players retained from the 2009 draft class. In the second half against the New York Giants, Barnes replaced Buchanon, whom coach Shanahan said \"wasn't playing good enough in the first half.\" Barnes recorded three tackles and defended one pass in the game, which was his most extensive playing time to that point. Against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Barnes started as a safety alongside Macho Harris because of injuries suffered by LaRon Landry, Kareem Moore, and Reed Doughty. In that game, Barnes intercepted a pass from David Garrard in overtime, which set up the game-winning field goal, 20–17.\nPrior to the 2011 season, Barnes was named as an Honorable Mention player on ESPN's list of the top 25 breakout players of the 2011 season. Multiple depth charts list Barnes as the starting nickelback and immediate back-up to DeAngelo Hall. Coaches have praised Barnes for his hard work ethic and knowledge of the game.\nKevin Barnes intercepted a pass thrown by Tony Romo on Monday Night Football in a Redskins loss (18–16) against the Dallas Cowboys.\n2011 season.\nAfter Carlos Rogers left the team, Barnes switched from his original jersey number of 25 to 22. In the 2011 season, he would serve as the team's nickel cornerback. He would have his first interception of the season and second of his career in Week 3 against the Dallas Cowboys.\nBarnes would catch another interception in Week 10 against the Miami Dolphins after nose tackle, Barry Cofield, hit Matt Moore's arm while Moore was throwing a pass.\nHe finished the season with 26 combined tackles, four pass breakups, and two interceptions.\n2012 season.\nDespite being used as a nickelback last season, it was reported that Barnes has been taking snaps at both the free safety and outside cornerback positions in the 2012 off-season under new defensive backs coach, Raheem Morris. With DeAngelo Hall taking over the nickelback position, he competed with and lost to the Redskins' free agent acquisition, Cedric Griffin, for the second outside cornerback slot opposite to starter, Josh Wilson.\nDetroit Lions.\nOn August 27, 2012, Barnes was traded to the Detroit Lions for an undisclosed draft pick. He was waived on September 18.\nCleveland Browns.\nOn March 25, 2013, Barnes signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Browns. He was released on May 13, 2013."

        "text": "Kenneth Gene \"The Tall Texan\" Jackson (April 26, 1929January 28, 1998) was an American football offensive lineman in the National Football League and Canadian Football League. A native of Austin, Texas, Jackson played college football at The University of Texas and then pro football for seven seasons for the Dallas Texans, the Baltimore Colts and the Montreal Alouettes.\nJackson was born in Thorndale, TX and went to high school at Austin High School in Austin, TX where he graduated in 1947.\nHe then went to the University of Texas where he played he played on the varsity team as a freshman. In 1949, he helped the team go to the Orange Bowl where they upset #8 Georgia. In 1950 he helped them win the Southwest Conference Championship and go to the 1951 Cotton Bowl Classic where they lost to Tennessee on a late game touchdown. Jackson finished his college career with an appearance in the 1951 Senior Bowl.\nJackson then joined the Navy during the Korean War. He was stationed in San Diego and played football for the Navy, making the All-Service Team. \nAfter his discharge, he was drafted by the New York Yankees, which then became the Dallas Texans, in the 2nd Round of the NFL draft (22nd overall). He played one season with the team as the Texans, playing in 12 games and starting 10 of them. The team moved to Baltimore and he went with them, playing 59 games with the team over the next 6 years.\nHe played one season with the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL in 1957 and then retired from football.\nIn 1959, he moved back to Austin and became owner and partner in Ken Jackson's Drive In for several years and then got into the pawn shop business, opening pawn shops all over Texas. He retired in Waco in 1981 and died at Methodist Hospital in Houston on January 28, 1988. \nHall of Famer Art Donovan was Jackson's teammate on the Colts and shared this anecdote: \"Jackson had this fight with Big Daddy [Lipscomb] up in training camp. Actually it wasn't really a fight. Big Daddy took a sucker shot at Jackson and decked him. By the time Jackson scrambled back up into the fray, there were people already breaking it up, so Jackson never really got any licks in. But he turned to Big Daddy and said, 'I'm gonna get you, you dirty bastard. You're dead meat.' No one doubted that he meant it.\n\"Every year the Colts would play an intrasquad exhibition game for the benefit of various Baltimore charities—the Boys' Club and whatnot—and sixty-two thousand fans would fill Memorial Stadium. So the 1957 game was perhaps three weeks after the fight, and nothing had happened between Big Daddy and Jackson. Then, right in the middle of the game, Jackson did it. He butted Big Daddy—broke his face mask, shattered his nose, and knocked a couple of teeth out. They dragged Big Daddy off the field unconscious. And when he woke up on the bench, he began mumbling, 'I'm gonna kill that Texas bastard. I'm gonna go back in there and kill him.'\n\"Jackson heard about it, went over to Big Daddy on the sideline, and told him, 'I hope you come back in for more. Cause I ain't through with you yet. I'm gonna murder you.' And he had this gleam in his eyes that really shook Big Daddy. Hell, it shook me, too. We went up to Big Daddy and told him, 'Gene, stay away from that guy. He will kill you.' And from that day on, Big Daddy avoided the Tall Texan like the plague. Jackson was a crazy bastard.\""

The original grounds were in Hall Hill Road (now Edgbaston Park Road), Edgbaston. The Society moved to its current premises next to Birmingham Botanical Gardens in 1867. The game of croquet was introduced from 1870, with the society's name being amended to reflect this.\nIt is not known exactly when tennis was established as part of the club's activities. A forerunner of the game was developed by Harry Gem and his friend Augurio Perera at the latter's home in Ampton Road, Edgbaston as early as 1859, but although Gem was a member of The Archery from 1864 to 1867 (his wife was member also from 1864 to 1872) there is no proof that he directly introduced the game to the club in this period, and the short-lived tennis club that Gem and Perera established in Leamington Spa in 1874 is the first that can be shown to have existed. The Archery's fixture card for 1875 shows tennis to have been well-established by this date, however, which makes The Archery the oldest still to survive."

        "title": "2010 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2010 proceeded according to rules enacted in 2001 and revised in 2007. As always, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recent players; one player was elected, Andre Dawson.\nIn keeping with the 2007 reform, one Veterans Committee convened to consider a ballot of managers and umpires, another to consider a ballot of executives. One manager and one umpire were elected: Whitey Herzog and Doug Harvey, respectively.\nAn induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 25, 2010.\nA Veterans Committee election to select from older players had been held in the 2009 cycle. The next election for players whose careers began in 1943 or later was scheduled for the 2011 class of inductees while the next for pre-1943 players was scheduled for the 2014 class. However, a reform of the Veterans Committee(s) was announced in July 2010. Per the announcement, long-retired players and all non-playing personnel would be considered on a single ballot, with the ballot restricted by the \"Era\" in which candidates made their greatest contributions. The next Veterans Committee elections, held in December 2010 as part of the 2011 induction cycle, considered only figures from what the Hall deemed the \"Expansion Era\", 1973 and later. Candidates from the \"Golden Era\" (1947–1972) were considered in the balloting for 2012, and candidates from the \"Pre-Integration Era\" (1871–1946) were considered in the balloting for 2013. These committee meetings were planned to be held in rotation thereafter, one each balloting.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1990 or later, but not after 2004; the ballot included candidates from the 2009 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 2004. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nResults of the 2010 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 6. The ballot consisted of 26 players, including 11 candidates returning from the 2009 ballot (a record low, displacing the previous year's record of 13).\n539 ballots were cast (including five ballots which supported no candidates), with 405 votes required for election. A total of 3,057 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.67 per ballot. Those candidates who received less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated with a dagger (†). The candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nThe newly-eligible candidates included 11 All-Stars, who were selected a combined total of 51 times – a notable decrease from 2009, when 22 All-Stars became eligible. Among the first-ballot candidates were 12-time All-Stars Roberto Alomar and Barry Larkin, 7-time All-Star Edgar Martínez, and 5-time All-Stars Andrés Galarraga and Fred McGriff. With respect to major end-of-season awards, the new field contained one Cy Young Award winner (Pat Hentgen), one MVP (Larkin) and one Rookie of the Year (Eric Karros). Alomar won ten Gold Gloves at second base (the most for any second baseman). Robin Ventura received six at third base. Larkin holds the record for most Silver Slugger Awards by a shortstop (nine). Edgar Martínez is tied for the record for most Outstanding Designated Hitter Awards (with David Ortiz) at five (the award has since been renamed the Edgar Martínez Award).\nPlayers who were eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Paul Abbott, Andy Ashby, Danny Bautista, Darren Bragg, Brian Boehringer, Dave Burba, Greg Colbrunn, Mike Fetters, Brook Fordyce, Karim García, Tom Goodwin, Ricky Gutiérrez, Jimmy Haynes, Sterling Hitchcock, Curt Leskanic, Josías Manzanillo, Brent Mayne, Mark McLemore, Scott Service, Chris Stynes, Scott Sullivan, Todd Van Poppel, John Vander Wal, Fernando Viña, and Turk Wendell.\nFor the first time in the history of BBWAA voting, two players fell shy of election by fewer than 10 votes. Blyleven, on the ballot for the 13th time, fell 5 votes shy; he gained 62 votes from his 2009 total. Alomar fell 8 votes short in his first appearance on the ballot, and received the highest percentage ever for a first-time candidate who was not elected at that time. Both would be elected in .\nVeterans Committee elections.\nThe Veterans Committee election process was revised in July 2007. With the 2007 rules changes, the composite ballot was split into two separate ballots—one for managers and umpires and the other for executives. Also, the voting membership of the Committee, which previously included all living members of the Hall, was reduced to include just a handful of those members, plus additional executives and sportswriters. Voting for both the managers/umpires and executives ballots, which now takes place prior to inductions in even-numbered years, began with the 2008 class of inductees, when two managers and three executives were elected. To be eligible, managers and umpires must be retired for at least five years, or for at least six months if they are age 65 or older, while executives must be either retired or at least age 65.\nA Historical Overview Committee of sportswriters appointed by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met to develop a ballot of 10 managers and umpires. The managers/umpires list was then submitted to a panel composed of Hall of Fame members, executives and veteran media members for a final vote. A separate ballot of 10 executives was developed by a panel including executives, players and writers, which was the same committee which finally voted in that area. The final ballots were released in November 2009. Each panel member was allowed to vote for up to four individuals on each ballot, and each candidate who received 75% of the vote from either panel was elected; therefore, a maximum of five inductions were possible from each ballot. Voting was conducted at baseball's winter meetings in Indianapolis on December 6, 2009, with the results announced the next day; as was the case with the 2008 class of inductees, the Committee met to discuss the candidates, although the previous three elections had been conducted by mail.\nManagers/umpires ballot.\nThe ballot for managers and umpires included eight managers (designated M) and two umpires (designated U), with 12 votes required for election. Candidates who received at least 75% of the vote were elected. Those that were inducted are indicated in bold italics.\nIn contrast with the 2008 election, voters made less of an effort to vote for as many candidates as they were allowed. While at least 58 of the permitted 64 individual votes were cast in 2008, the number of known individual votes cast in this election was 48 of the possible 64. (Vote totals for the five trailing candidates were announced as \"less than 3\", or 0 to 2.) Seven of the candidates had been on the preceding ballot in 2008, with Grimm, Kelly, and O'Neill appearing for the first time and umpire Cy Rigler dropping off the ballot. Four candidates were living when the final results were announced—Harvey (age 79), Herzog (78), Johnson (66), and Kelly (59).\nThe election committee, which was announced on the same day as the ballot, included:\nOf the 16 members of the election committee, 11 voted for the class of 2008. The five new voters were all Hall of Famers—Murray, Roberts, Sandberg, Smith, and 2008 inductee Dick Williams. Because of the changes announced for future elections, this was the last meeting of this particular committee.\nOf the ten candidates for election, Doug Harvey and Whitey Herzog received the 75% needed to garner induction.\nExecutives ballot.\nOn the executives ballot, 9 votes were required for election; no candidates were elected.\nAs with the other committee, voters in this election made less of an effort to vote for as many candidates as allowed than in the 2008 election. The number of individual votes cast went down to a greater degree than in the managers/umpires balloting—only 28 of the possible 48 individual votes were known to have been cast in this election, compared to 44 in the 2008 voting. (Vote totals for the six trailing candidates were announced as \"less than 3\", or 0 to 2.)\nOf the 10 candidates, six (Fetzer, Howsam, Kauffman, McHale, Miller, and Paul) were holdovers from the 2008 ballot. Autry, Breadon, and Ruppert appeared on the ballot for the first time; White, who was on the 2007 composite ballot but was not on the 2008 ballot, returned for 2010. Buzzie Bavasi, who died in the intervening period, was on the 2008 ballot but not the 2010 ballot. Two candidates were living when the results were announced—Miller, age 92, and White, age 75.\nThe election committee, which was announced on the same day as the ballot, included:\nOf the 12 members of the election committee, eight voted for the class of 2008. The new voters were Hall of Famers Roberts and Seaver, executive Schuerholz, and sportswriter Pepe. As with the managers/umpires voting committee, this was the final meeting for the executives voting committee because of the voting changes announced in July 2010.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, but instead are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum.\nThree final candidates, selected by a three-member BBWAA committee, were named on July 14, 2009 at Busch Stadium in St. Louis in conjunction with All-Star Game activities: Bill Madden, national baseball columnist for the \"New York Daily News\", Bob Elliott of the \"Toronto Sun\" and Joe Giuliotti, retired from the \"Boston Herald\". All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to cast ballots in voting conducted by mail in November.\nOn December 8 at baseball's winter meetings, Bill Madden was announced as the recipient. Madden, who started his career in 1969 with United Press International before joining the \"Daily News\" in 1978, received 226 votes out of the 452 ballots cast, with Elliott receiving 149 votes and Giuliotti receiving 76; one blank ballot was submitted.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nThe Ford C. Frick Award has been presented at the induction ceremonies annually since 1978 to a broadcaster. Recipients are not considered to be members of the Hall, but are permanently recognized in an exhibit at the museum. After the 2007 changes to the Veterans Committee, the winner (if living) is no longer an automatic member of that body. To be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two.\nTen finalists were announced in January 2010. In accordance with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a committee composed of the living recipients, along with additional broadcasting historians and columnists. Three additional candidates were selected from a list of candidates through results of voting by fans conducted in December 2009 on the Hall's Facebook page. The recipient was announced in February following a vote by the same committee which selected the first group of finalists. They based the selection on the following criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans.\nJon Miller, radio announcer for the San Francisco Giants, television play-by-play announcer for ESPN Sunday Night Baseball and regular-season and postseason announcer on ESPN Radio, was announced as the 2010 Ford C. Frick Award winner on February 2, 2010. Beginning his career in 1974 with the Oakland Athletics, he is best known for his radio work with the Baltimore Orioles from 1983 through 1996, and the Giants from 1997 to the present. Before joining ESPN in 1990, he worked with NBC from 1986 through 1989. He also worked with The Baseball Network."

        "text": "James Cannon is a rugby union player from England. He primarily plays as a lock. Cannon currently plays for English Championship side Ealing Trailfinders. He joined the side in April 2019. He has previously played for Connacht, Wasps and Northampton Saints, and has had loan spells with Bedford Blues and London Scottish.\nEarly life.\nCannon was born in Kettering and attended Bishop Stopford School in the town. He is the son of Vince Cannon, who made 438 appearances for Northampton Saints, captained the side and is in the club's Hall of Fame. Despite this Cannon didn't play rugby until he was in secondary school. Cannon also played for local rugby club Kettering RFC, lining out for the team in the Midlands Division 2 East. From Kettering, he was signed to the Northampton Saints academy.\nClub rugby career.\nNorthampton Saints.\nCannon joined Northampton Saints academy for the 2007–08 season. He made his debut for the first team in the 2007–08 National Division One on 4 March 2008. He was still in the academy but an injury crisis meant that he started in the midweek game against Launceston, which Northampton won 72–7. Cannon was named on the bench against Pertemps Bees four days later, but did not come on. He made his second appearance for the side as a replacement against Exeter Chiefs on 22 March 2016 and started against Nottingham a week later on 29 March. Cannon made a total of three appearances for the Saints in his debut season as they were promoted to the Premiership.\nIn the 2007–08 season, Cannon's second year in the academy, he didn't feature for Northampton's first team after the club's return to the Premiership. He was an unused replacement in a 2008–09 EDF Energy Cup game against Bristol.&lt;ref name=\"StatBunker 08/09\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, Cannon was sent out on loan to get game time.\nLoan to Bedford Blues.\nCannon was loaned to Bedford Blues in the National League 1 for the 2008–09 season. He made his debut for the team on 1 November 2008 when he played the full 80 minutes against Cornish Pirates. Cannon made a total 17 appearances for the Blues during his loan, all but four of these coming as starts, as Bedford finished third in the division.\nReturn to Northampton.\nCannon stayed with Northampton Saints for the 2009–10 season. He made his Premiership debut on 31 October 2009 against Leicester Tigers, starting the match and playing 55 minutes in a 29–15 loss. Cannon featured in two more games in the 2009–10 Premiership, coming on as a late replacement against Leeds Carnegie and starting against Bath. Saints finished second in the league table, but were beaten in the semi-final by Saracens. He also played three times in the 2009–10 LV Cup, which Saints ultimately won, and scored his first try in a Cup game against Ospreys. Cannon played in a total of six games for the first team over the course of the season.&lt;ref name=\"StatBunker 09/10\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He left the club at the end of the season having made a total of nine first team appearances.\nWasps.\nIt was announced in April 2010 that Cannon had signed a two-year deal with Wasps. He joined the side ahead of the 2010–11 season. Cannon made his Wasps debut in a 2010–11 Premiership against Newcastle Falcons on 10 September 2010. He made his first ever appearance in the Heineken Cup as a replacement against Toulouse on 10 October 2010. Cannon made a total of 15 appearances in the Premiership in his first season with the side and played in four of Wasps' six games in the 2010–11 Heineken Cup. He also started four games in the 2010–11 LV Cup. Cannon didn't play in the 2010–11 Challenge Cup for the side, being an unused replacement in the team's only game in the competition, a 32–22 defeat to Harlequins in the quarter-finals. All together, he made 23 appearances in his debut season, all but five of these coming as starts.&lt;ref name=\"StatBunker 10/11\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nCannon didn't play as regularly for Wasps in his second season, missing a large part of the season through injury. His first appearance of the year came on 24 February 2012, when he played 80 minutes in a 2011–12 Premiership match against Sale Sharks in a 46–34 defeat. He played in a further four Premiership games, as Wasps finished in 11th place avoiding relegation by just one point. Cannon also made a single appearance in the 2011–12 Challenge Cup, starting in the quarter-final against Biarritz which Wasps lost 26–23.&lt;ref name=\"StatBunker 11/12\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his lack of game time over the course of the season, Cannon signed a contract extension with Wasps in March 2012.\nWith his return to fitness, Cannon played more regularly in the 2012–13 season. He made 12 appearances in the 2012–13 Premiership, with eight of these coming as starts, as Wasps finished 8th. Cannon played in four of Wasps' six pool stage games in the 2012–13 Challenge Cup and scored his first try for the club against Mogliano, but didn't feature in the quarter-final defeat to Leinster. In addition to the league and Challenge Cup, he also played in four games in the 2012–13 LV Cup. Cannon played a total of 22 games in his third season with the team, and on the back of these performances was awarded another contract extension.\nCannon played 12 times in the 2013–14 Premiership, starting four of these games. He also played in three games in the 2013–14 Challenge Cup and four in the 2013–14 LV Cup, starting all of these.&lt;ref name=\"StatBunker 13/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, Wasps finished 7th in the Premiership, which put them into a play-off to qualify for the following season's Champions Cup. Cannon did not take part in the two-leg play-off against Stade Français, which Wasps won.\nIn the following season, Cannon continued to have a limited role in the first team, starting five of the team's 2014–15 Premiership games and coming on as a replacement in a further three. He started all four of the team's games in the 2014–15 LV Cup, and featured from the replacements bench in a 2014–15 Champions Cup game against Castres.&lt;ref name=\"StatBunker 14/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his lack of game time, Cannon signed another contract extension with Wasps for the 2015–16 season.\nCannon made his first appearance of the 2015–16 season in a Premiership game against Harlequins on 16 October 2015.&lt;ref name=\"StatBunker 15/16\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the season however, Cannon went on loan to London Scottish in the Championship. He made a single appearance for the side during his loan, starting against Rotherham Titans on 5 December 2015. Cannon returned to Wasps in the new year and featured from the bench against his former club Northampton Saints on 29 January 2016. Following this, he played in eight more Premiership fixtures, making a total of 10 appearances for Wasps for the season.

        "title": "Golf House",
        "text": "Golf House is a former estate house that was constructed in the early 1900s by John D. Rockefeller in Lakewood Township in Ocean County, New Jersey, United States.\nConstruction of the Rockefeller estate.\nJohn Rockefeller began acquiring property in Lakewood, New Jersey in March 1901. In early November 1903, he purchased , including from the Ocean County Hunt and Country club which became the core of the Rockefeller Lakewood estate. The Club had held the first Professional Golf Association tournament on their grounds on January 1, 1898. \nIn March 1907, Rockefeller increased the wages given to workers at Golf House from $1.50 to $1.65 per day, as he was having difficulty obtaining enough workers to perform the improvements he had planned to the property, which included building as much as three miles (5 km) of new roads and planting 1,000 evergreen saplings around the golf course. Only residents of New Jersey were hired and all applicants required a reference from someone known by William Foerster, Rockefeller's superintendent. The prevailing wage for laborers in the area had been $1.50 per day, and \"The New York Times\" described that the 10% wage increase Rockefeller offered would put pressure on other area employers, such as George Jay Gould I, to match the higher amount.\nRockefeller's summer retreat was 30-room, 20-bathroom, three-story mansion wrapped with glass-enclosed porches. The estate included a dairy, sheepfold, woodland, and a 9-hole golf course. Rockefeller and his household would spend spring and sometime parts of the summer at Lakewood.\nSale to Ocean County.\nRockefeller Sr. had lived in the Golf House estate during the spring and fall until he died in 1937. In 1925, the property was sold to John D. Rockefeller Jr., with his father leasing the property thereafter. It was reported that Rockefeller Jr. had paid $3,068,000 for the property. As of May 1938, \"The New York Times\" reported that the house had been on the market for more than a year at a price of $250,000 but that there were no serious offers despite many visits from prospective buyers. In 1934, the property's value was estimated at $1 million.\nWhen John Rockefeller died in 1937, his son John D. Rockefeller Jr. discussed putting the estate up for sale. Unable to find a buyer after a few years, John Jr. discussed with the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County the possibility of the county taking over the property. On April 17, 1940 the Board of Freeholders formally accepted the property and the park opened on August 27, 1940. The Freeholders approved the acceptance of the gift despite opposition from the Lakewood Taxpayers Association, which complained that the township would lose $150,000 in property taxes by taking the property off of the tax rolls. The gift included the 26-room house and its furnishings, a number of accompanying buildings, flower gardens and a nine-hole golf course.\nOcean County Park.\nThe property is now Ocean County Park, a in Lakewood Township, administered by the Ocean County Department of Parks &amp; Recreation. The white pine, hemlock and other evergreen trees imported from around the country and planted a century before have matured. The park offers facilities including a disc golf course, tennis courts, sports fields, hiking trails, beach volleyball and a driving range, all free of charge. During the summer, playgrounds and a swimming lake are available. During the winter, the site can be used for cross-country skiing.\nThe house itself was used for various purposes after the park was established, but the building was eventually razed by the county in 1966. All that remains to mark the spot of the main house today is the flag pole and a marker. The carriage house, greatly enlarged, is now home to the Ocean County Police Academy, while the Ocean County Fire Marshal's Office occupies the superintendent's house. However, little of historical significance remains of these auxiliary buildings.\nDuring WWII, the New York Giants held spring training on the parks two ball fields."

His performances helped him progress to the third round of the 2004 UK Open automatically where he narrowly lost 8–7 to Andy Jenkins. He then reached a semi final in the Midlands Regional for the 2005 UK Open as he entered the third round automatically once more, losing to Roland Scholten. He followed this with a quarter final showing in the Open Holland.\nBarnard started his 2006 UK Open campaign in the second round, beating Nigel Langton 8–1. He then beat Lee Palfreyman in the third round to reach the fourth round for the very first time. He was drawn against Ronnie Baxter and lost 11–7. Poor form forced Barnard to begin his 2007 UK Open campaign in the first round where he beat Vernon Sheppard but lost in the second round to Paul Williams. He then lost in the preliminary round in the 2008 UK Open, losing to Paul Cooper.\nBesides from the UK Open, Barnard had failed to qualify for any of the other PDC majors. This run ended when he won one of eight places to qualify for the 2009 PDC World Darts Championship. He was beaten by Andy Hamilton in round one.\nHaving finished the 2011 season ranked too low to retain his PDC tour card automatically, Barnard entered the PDC Q School in January 2012. On the second day Barnard earned his tour card for 2012 and 2013 by beating John Bowles 6–2 in the final stage.\nIn May 2012, Barnard earned a place in the German Darts Championship in Berlin by defeating Adrian Gray and James Richardson in the UK qualifier. He received a bye through the first round when Gary Anderson withdrew and then lost to Co Stompé in round two 6–5. He reached the last 32 of three other ProTour events during 2012, but could never advance beyond this stage. Barnard went into 2013 ranked world number 77.\nBarnard failed to qualify for the 2013 UK Open as he finished 115th on the Order of Merit, outside of the top 96 who claimed their places. He reached the main stage of two European Tour events during the year, the first being a 6–2 opening round defeat to Andy Smith at the German Darts Championship. The other was at the Dutch Darts Masters where Barnard defeated Stuart Kellett 6–3 and Kevin Painter 6–4 to record his best finish of 2013 by reaching the last 16. He faced world number two Michael van Gerwen and was defeated 6–1. Barnard once again entered Q School to remain on the PDC Tour as he was ranked 82nd in the world after the 2014 World Championship outside the top 64 on the Order of Merit. His best result during the four days came on the final day when he lost in the last 16 5–3 to Jason Hogg, a result which saw him finish inside the top 24 on the Q School Order of Merit to earn a fresh two-year tour card.\nBarnard was beaten 5–1 by Stuart Kellett in the second round of the 2014 UK Open. He qualified for the Dutch Darts Masters and lost 6–5 to Vincent van der Voort in the first round. Barnard reached the last 32 of Pro Tour events three times during the year but was knocked out on each occasion. He participated in the 2015 German Darts Championship, but was knocked out 6–5 by Joe Murnan in the opening round. Barnard's deepest run in 2015 came at the 15th Players Championship where he was eliminated in the last 16 6–5 by Devon Petersen.\nBarnard qualified for the 2016 International Darts Open, but lost 6–5 to Mike Holz in the first round.

        "text": "Mike Young (born December 21, 1955) is a former Australian cricket team fielding coach, as well as a former US minor league and Australian baseball manager, player and coach.\nPlaying career.\nYoung attended the University of Wisconsin-River Falls and he was the team's MVP in 1978. After graduation, he managed to land a contract to play in the Netherlands Honkbal Hoofdklasse baseball league and he played there in 1979 and 1980 and realized that there were other opportunities for American players to ply their skills around the globe. He sent his resume around and was contacted in 1981 by the Queensland Rams, an Australian Baseball League team, which he also player-coached and led to a national championship (the Claxton Shield) in 1982.\nManagerial career.\nAmerica.\nBecause the Australian and American seasons do not overlap, Young was able to pursue opportunities on both continents, and in 1985 landed the job of coach with the Medicine Hat Blue Jays, his first in organised baseball. In 1989, he managed the Bluefield Orioles in the Appalachian League and the Wausau Timbers in the Midwest League in 1990. He was a coach with the Rochester Red Wings in 1991 and 1992, then returned to managing with two seasons in the Cleveland Indians organisation.\nAustralia.\nAt the same time, he was becoming a major player in the development of baseball in Australia, landing a coaching job with the Australian national team. He managed the team at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. He was twice named the International Baseball Federation coach of the year, in 1997 and 1999, for his work with the Australian national team. This included its results in two Intercontinental Cups, a bronze medal in the 1997 tournament and then to a gold medal at home in 1999. Young's work down under coincided with a period when Australian baseball was booming, producing Major League players like Dave Nilsson, Mark Hutton, Cam Cairncross, Shayne Bennett and Chris Snelling, all of whom reached the major leagues. This boom is linked to Young's work, as he is the one who developed the idea of the Australian Baseball Academy, which is jointly funded by Major League Baseball and aims at grooming Australian baseball talent. The number of Australian players signed by MLB has quadrupled since the Academy's foundation.\nCricket.\nYoung's career took another twist in 2000 when the Australian cricket federation approached him for help. Fielding has long been an under-developed aspect of cricket, as teams have concentrated on developing bowlers and batsmen. The Australians, observing how fielding was a central part of baseball, decided to exploit an opportunity by having Young coach their players on catching, throwing and positioning. Young was appointed as an assistant coach until 2005 when his contract was not renewed and instead moved back to Chicago to manage the Rockford Riverhawks. During the 2005 Ashes series the Australian teams fielding had slipped and the side lost the Ashes to England for the first time since 1987. John Buchanan then made the decision for Australia to have a full-time fielding coach and Young became speculated in the media as the first baseball coach to coach a national cricket team and announced he would like to finish his managerial career doing it. In 2009 he spent three weeks working with the Indian cricket team as a fielding consultant."

He was later scouted by coach Eddie Gullas who convinced him to suit up for the Green Lancers collegiate team of the University of Visayas (UV). He came into wider public attention due to UV's upset 74-63 win against the Ateneo de Manila in an intercollegiate tournament in Manila in 1957.

He later played for Meralco and Mariwasa during the 1970s in the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association.\nInternational career.\nMárquez was a former member of Philippine national team. His performance playing with the University of Visayas gained the attention of head coach Baby Dalupan helping Márquez secure a place in the Philippines roster for the 1959 FIBA World Championship in Chile.\nMárquez has also suited up for the Philippines at the Olympic Games participating in 1960 edition in Rome and the 1968 edition in Mexico City. In the 1960 Summer Olympics, the Philippines placed 11th and in 1968, the national squad placed 13th. Márquez played a significant role in the Philippines' 63-60 win against South Korea in the play off for 13th place. Márquez contributed the most points for the Philippines in that game scoring 18 points while his Korean counterpart Shin Dong-pa made 16 points for his team.\nRetirement and later life.\nMárquez retired from competitive basketball to focus on his family. He held a management position at the Kamuning branch of Meralco and later held a position in the government accounts department in the main office of the same electricity company.

While with Swansea, Jones was selected for his one and only international game, as a centre in Wales' 10-6 victory over France in the 1924 Five Nations Championship match at Stade Colombes on 27 March 1924. That same year Jones left union, and any future international caps for the Wales union team, behind him when he 'Went North' switching to the professional league code.\nInternational honours.\nJoe Jones won a cap for Wales (RU) while at Swansea RFC in 1924, and won a cap for Wales (RL) while at Leeds in 1926.\nNotable tour matches.\nJoe Jones played right-, i.e. number 3, in Wakefield Trinity's 14-3 victory over Australia in the tour match at Belle Vue, Wakefield on Saturday 28 September 1929.\n\"\"The Colonials had a strong side, but were well and truly beaten in a game in which Trinity surprised friend and foe alike by a great display. They were the first team to beat the Australians on that tour.\"\nContemporaneous Article Extract.\n\"Joseph Jones. The death of Mr. Joe Jones three weeks ago came upon us suddenly, although it had been apparent to those in closest touch with him that his health was failing. We had hoped that he might make a complete recovery and be able to resume his place in the club's councils which he so much valued. His earliest football in his native Wales had brought him international honours when he decided to change his code and join Leeds R.L.F.C. Soon he was at Belle Vue where, for over thirty years he has rendered most useful and untiring service as a player, then on the Staff, and for the last 13½ years on the committee. He has also been Vice-Chairman of the Club and a member of the Rugby League Council. Thus, to our great regret, another good club man has been removed from our midst. Our sympathy goes to his family in their bereavement, the more so since Mrs. Jones has been for some time suffering from serious illness, a combination of extremely sad circumstances.\"\""

Overall, the Tigers were picked third behind North Carolina and Florida State respectively.\nRegular season.\nOn March 5, 2009, Head Coach Jack Leggett announced that Fifth-year shortstop Stan Widmann had left the team due to personal reasons. Widmann, who graduated from Clemson with a degree in sport management the previous December, had withdrawn from school to pursue job opportunities.\nOn Wednesday, March 18, pitchers Justin Sarratt, Scott Weismann, Kyle Deese, Tomas Cruz, and Matt Vaughn combined to pitch a no-hitter in Clemson's 14–0 victory over USC Upstate at Doug Kingsmore Stadium. It was the Tigers' 14th no-hitter in school history and first since the second game of a doubleheader on March 6, 1984, when Scott Parrish no-hit The Citadel in a seven-inning game. It was also just the second no-hitter involving multiple pitchers in Tiger history.\nOn Tuesday, April 21, sophomore outfielder Jeff Shaus hit a walk-off grand slam to lift the Tigers to a 5–3 victory over the visiting Coastal Carolina Chanticleers. It was Clemson's first walk-off home run since April 27, 2007, when Doug Hogan hit a walk-off solo homer to top Georgia Tech 3–2 in 11 innings.

        "text": "Mikko Niemi (born June 17, 1972 in Tampere, Finland) is a retired Finnish professional ice hockey player.\nCareer.\nNiemi began his career at junior level icing for his local team Ilves Tampere at junior A SM-liiga standard, the highest level of junior ice hockey. In his first season, 1989/90 he featured in 34 games, and helped out the offence with six points. This pushed Ilves into the post-season, where Niemi played on three occasions and also managing his first post-season point. Niemi was a cornerstone of the junior team, playing more than 60 times throughout the 1990/91 and 1991/92 seasons, again making the post-season in 1992 where he scored his first playoff goal.\nNiemi's chance at senior level came the following season, 1992/93. He alternated between the junior A standard and full SM-liiga level and played 8 times for the full Ilves team, a significant achievement for a twenty-year-old defenceman. Part way through the 1992/93 season however, Niemi made a temporary move to FPS who played at the lower Mestis standard in Niemi's homeland. The defenceman coped well with the change and scored 5 points in 23 games at senior level as well as 3 points in 7 junior contests.\nFor the start of the 1993/94 season, Niemi was an Ilves player and played on five occasions in the SM-liiga. He was sent out to lower division teams again however in order to develop him as a player, this time icing for Hermes Kokkola and KooVee, another team from the city of Tampere. Niemi found himself as a regular player for both teams.\nHis showings at the lower level again persuaded Ilves to recall Niemi to their first team squad for the 1994/95 season. He found only limited opportunities however, playing just five SM-liiga games and making six Liigakarsinta appearances. It was his last season as an Ilves player, as Niemi chose to move to Sweden and Örebro IK. Again he failed to establish himself as a key player, and made just eleven appearances before a mid-season switch to play for the Durham Wasps of the BHL. Niemi played 15 times for the Wasps before the end of the season. Despite a reasonably successful spell in the United Kingdom, Niemi moved to Germany and EV Landsberg. This sparked Niemi's point scoring ability, and in 53 games he scored 41 points, a remarkable total for a defenceman.\nNiemi remained in Germany for the following season (1997–98), although moved to play for the EV Duisburg organisation. Here he was rather less successful, playing just 16 times and managing just one assist. Niemi failed to gain a contract for fully professional hockey the next year, and returned for the 1999/2000 season as a Herlev Hornets player. The Hornets ice in the highest level of Danish hockey, the Oddset Ligaen. Niemi combined his defensive duties with his offensive talent well for Herlev, scoring 22 points in 42 league games. This success saw Niemi signed by Rungsted IK, again of the Oddset Ligaen for the 2000/01 term. Niemi stayed just one season though before moving back to Herlev, where he again tasted success and helped the team into the post season.\nNiemi returned to the United Kingdom for the 2003/04 season, and played in the newly formed EIHL for the London Racers in their debut season as an organisation. Niemi played 19 games for the Racers before moving mid-season to another team playing their first season, the Manchester Phoenix. The Phoenix organisation struggled financially however, and at the end of the season had to temporarily terminate playing operations.\nThis prompted Niemi to return to his native Finland and sign for HC Montreal of the Suomi-sarja, the third tier of Finnish ice hockey. Niemi played on ten occasions for Montreal, scoring one point. He remained in the Sarja for his final professional season, icing for LeKi Lempäälä on nine occasions before announcing his retirement from the game."

        "title": "Sport bowling",
        "text": "Sport Bowling is any form of ten pin bowling that uses patterns of lane oil to reduce the effectiveness of modern bowling balls. It was created by the United States Bowling Congress, the governing body of the sport of ten-pin bowling, to offer players the opportunity to bowl on exactly the same lane conditions and oil patterns that professional bowlers face while on the PBA Tour. Sport Bowling originally referred to leagues, known as PBA Experience Leagues, which are offered in conjunction with the Professional Bowlers Association. However, the term is now used to refer to any bowling event which incorporates a \"sport shot\" or oil pattern.\nAs bowling technology has progressed the ability to consistently and strongly hook a bowling ball became significantly easier and as a result professional and league bowling scores increased. Over time achieving honor scores (e.g. 300 games, 800+ series) became far more common to the point of diminishing the accomplishment associated with achieving these scores. To counter this trend the idea of custom oil patterns or \"sport shot\" that could be programmed into a lane conditioning machine and laid on the lane emerged.\nLane friction topography.\nLane conditions are created by, cleaning the lane surface and then applying lane oil in a pattern via a lane oiling machine. Lane oil is designed to both protect the surface and influence the bowling ball hook. Ball hook is the product of its surface material (cover stock), balance (core), the direction of travel, speed of delivery, and spin (angular momentum). As the ball travels toward the pins it interacts with the lane surface and reacts to friction. As the ball encounters friction its angular momentum is consumed changing its trajectory. In areas of the lane where there is less oil the ball will change direction (hook) and in areas of the lane where there is more oil the ball will not change direction (skid).\nA \"topographic map\" that illustrates the location and quantity of oil placed on the lane can be found for each oil pattern. Areas within zones that contain a large volume of oil are depicted as high terrain and areas with a small volume of oil are depicted as low terrain. Bowlers can use these maps to formulate strategies to manipulate their ball to cross this frictional landscape.\nBreak point.\nEach oil pattern has a \"breakpoint\" at which the bowling ball moves off of the most heavily oiled part of the lane onto the \"back end\". The back end is the place where the majority of the bowling ball hook is desired by an experienced bowler because it creates \"angle to the pocket\". Bowling balls that simultaneously (or almost simultaneously) hit the one and two pin on a strong angle (up to 6 degrees) from the left side or the one and three pin from the right side are very likely to strike. A properly executed \"pocket hit\" causes the bowling ball to travel off-center through the pins driving these into other pins either directly or off of the walls on either side of the pin deck. It's the side-to-side \"pin action\" that creates a greater likelihood to strike.\nThe \"Rule of 31\" is be used to estimate the break point for different patterns (calculated as the distance of length of the oil pattern in feet minus 31. This value indicates the board on the lane at the end of the oil pattern that is approximately the break point.\nHouse patterns.\nA typical \"house pattern\" ranges from 38 to 42 feet in length and the oil is tapered from the outside to the center such that the outside of the lane has the least amount of oil and the center has the most. The lack of oil on the outside of the lane and an abundance of oil near the center creates a funnel effect that causes balls rolled on the outside of the lane to hook to the pins and balls rolled in middle of the lane to slide to the pins.\nUSBC Sport Certified - PBA Experience Patterns.\nUSBC sport patterns range from 32 to 53 feet in length, creating a break point either much further up or back on the lane as compared to a typical house pattern. An even application of oil across the width of the lane largely eliminates the funnel effect built into the typical house shot thus requiring greater accuracy and speed control to consistently hit the break point with the desired back end reaction.\nIn each pattern, oil volume is applied consistently within each of up to 8 defined zones. Pattern definitions are changed regularly between tournaments, so patterns with the same name will have multiple official definitions over time. To master each sport shot requires knowledge and experience to understand where to play and how to adjust as the pattern changes.\nSecond generation patterns.\nIntroduced by the PBA May 7, 2013."

        "title": "Simul climbing",
        "text": "Simul climbing, also known as climbing with a running belay, is a climbing method or style where all the climbers climb at the same time while tied into the same rope. Protection is placed by the first member of the rope team and the last member removes the pieces of gear. The length of rope used during simul climbing varies but is often between . In most cases, the climbing team maintains multiple pieces of protection between them to prevent a system failure if one of the pieces was to fail. Usually, a belay device is not used. However, the first climber may be belayed by the second until enough rope is out for the leader to avoid a ground fall. Similarly, the leader may use a belay device as the second approaches a belay station to avoid the potential for a large fall.\nFall potential.\nThe roles of the leader and second in simul climbing are very different than they are in free climbing. If the leader falls during free climbing, the second (follower) is pulled up from their belay station. In simul climbing, if the leader falls, the second is pulled up from wherever they are climbing. The hazards of a fall for the second climber relative to the lead climber are more similar than they are when they are free climbing.\nNonetheless, the hazards during a fall are significantly different for simul climbing when compared to free climbing. For example, in simul climbing, the leader can be pulled off the rock when the second climber falls unexpectedly. If both climbers are climbing on or above an overhang and either falls, they may both fall away from the rock and be left hanging by their rope beneath the overhang. This would require them to climb the rope, or swing themselves, or adjust their weight difference significantly so that one of them can reach the rock again.\nIn free climbing, the second climber traditionally belays from a stationary belay position and is not in a position to fall. In simul climbing the second is actively climbing and can sustain a fall. If the second falls while simul climbing the leader catches the fall with their own body. This jolt has a high likelihood of pulling the leader off the rock towards their last piece of gear. This sort of fall has the potential to be devastating for the leader. To avoid this possibility it is traditional to put the better climbers second so that they will not fall.\nVariations.\nSimul climbing or variations of simul climbing are commonly used while speed climbing."

        "text": "Steve Campbell (born April 11, 1966) is an American football coach and former player. Campbell was the head football coach at the University of South Alabama from 2018 to 2020. Campbell has previously served as head football coach at Southwest Mississippi Community College from 1997 to 1998, Delta State University from 1999 to 2001, Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College from 2004 to 2013 and the University of Central Arkansas from 2014 until 2017.\nHe has been involved with three National Championship winning teams — first as an NCAA Division II player in 1987, then as a D-II head coach in 2000 and lastly as a junior college head coach in 2007.\nPersonal life.\nCampbell was a football player in college, starting at center in 43 straight games for Southeastern Louisiana and Troy State University. In 1987, he was a member of the NCAA Division II National Championship team at Troy, and was named an All-Gulf South Conference first team selection. Campbell was named Academic All-Conference three times and graduated cum laude from Troy State with a bachelor's degree in economics. He also earned a master's degree in business administration from Auburn University.\nCoaching career.\nCampbell's coaching career started as a graduate assistant at Auburn University under head coach Pat Dye, where he helped the Tigers football team win back-to-back SEC titles. While on the Plains, Campbell got experience coaching in two bowl games, including the 1990 Hall of Fame Bowl where they defeated Ohio State 31–14.\nHis first full-time position was as offensive line coach and strength and conditioning coach at Delta State University from 1990 to 1992. He spent his final season as the offensive coordinator for DSU before taking the position of offensive coordinator and backfield coach under Rick Rhoades at Nicholls State University from 1993 to 1995 (Rhoades was Campbell's coach at Troy).\nIn 1997, Campbell received his first head coaching position, taking over at Southwest Mississippi Community College, where he had spent the previous season coaching the running backs. During his two seasons with the Bears, Campbell's teams went 12–8, including the school's first winning season in 12 years.\nCampbell returned to Delta State University as head coach in 1999, compiling a 27–8 record with a school record (.771) winning percentage over three seasons. His no-huddle offense shattered 12 Gulf South Conference Records and six NCAA Division II records. DSU also won the 2000 NCAA Division II Championship, with Campbell earning National Coach of the Year honors by three different organizations. His final season at Delta State was the 2001 season.\nIn 2002, Campbell became the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach at Middle Tennessee State University. At Middle Tennessee, Campbell's offense produced a 1,000-yard rusher and scored more than 20 points against three of the four SEC teams faced, including a win at in-state rival Vanderbilt. In 2003, he then served as offensive line coach for Jackie Sherrill in his last season at Mississippi State before taking the head coaching position at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College in March 2004.\nAt Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College (MGCCC), he went 87–22 (.798) over his ten seasons from 2004 to 2013 despite his predecessor going only 6–12 in his two seasons in charge. Campbell coached Gulf Coast to a NJCAA Junior College co-National Championship in 2007. Several players on that team went on to play in the Southeastern Conference including Eltoro Freeman and Demond Washington at Auburn, Terrence Cody at Alabama and Chris White and Sean Brauchle at Mississippi State. Prior to Campbell's arrival, the Bulldogs football team had not made it to the state playoffs since 1986.\nIn December 2008, Campbell was a finalist for the head coaching position at Northwestern State University. Other finalists included Bradley Dale Peveto, co-defensive coordinator at Louisiana State University and a former Northwestern State assistant, who eventually got the job.\nOn January 12, 2009, Campbell interviewed with new head coach Gene Chizik to fill the vacant position coaching the offensive line at Auburn University, but the job was filled by Colorado assistant head coach Jeff Grimes.\nCampbell led his 2009 MGCCC Bulldogs team to a 9–2 record after losing 75–71 in the MACJC State Championship game, ending Gulf Coast's bid for three straight MACJC titles.\nIn 2010, Campbell led Gulf Coast to a 10–2 record (the two losses were a combined six points) including a 31–17 win over Copiah-Lincoln in the MACJC Championship game and a 62–53 win versus #3 ranked Grand Rapids (10–1) in the Mississippi Bowl. The combined 115 points set a Mississippi Bowl record. A member of that team, Don Jones went on to be drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the 2013 NFL draft and made the team as a safety. Under Campbell's leadership, Gulf Coast consistently ranked in the NJCAA National Poll, finishing #13 in 2005, #8 in 2006, #1 in 2007, #4 in 2008, #8 in 2009, #3 in 2010 and #6 in 2011.\nIn December 2013, Campbell was named head football coach at the University of Central Arkansas (UCA). From 2014 to 2017, he compiled a record of 33 wins and 15 losses over four seasons, made two playoff appearances, and won a Southland Conference championship. In December 2017, Campbell agreed to a four-year contract with the University of South Alabama that paid him $600,000 per year, triple what he was earning at FCS Central Arkansas. Campbell's replacement at UCA was his offensive coordinator, Nathan Brown. After going 9–26 in three years, South Alabama decided to move on from Campbell."

Lafayette has also qualified for the NCAA tournament ten times, but only twice since 1966.\nFacilities.\nKamine Stadium is the home of Lafayette baseball. The stadium was renovated in 2003, establishing permanent seating and a permanent press box. It is a natural grass field with an official capacity of 500.\nHistory.\nBaseball is the oldest sport at the college, with a club team competing on a College Hill since March 1860. The team's first official game was a 44–11 win on November 8, 1865, against amateurs from Easton. The first recorded intercollegiate match was a 45–45 tie in a baseball game against Lehigh in October 1869 and its first win against Lehigh 31–24 shortly thereafter.\nAside from its traditional Ivy League and local rivals, Lafayette developed a rivalry with North Carolina and South Carolina in the late 19th and early 20th century. Games were played on March Field, and were later played at Fisher Stadium. Once the Metzgar Athletic Complex was built in the late 1960s, the team moved its field to what is now known as Kamine Stadium.\nLafayette has made four appearances in the College World Series in the 1950s and 1960s, the final round of the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship. Coached by former major leaguer Charlie Gelbert, the Leopards made it the semi-finals in 1953 before bowing to the University of Texas, finishing third. Lafayette eliminated Stanford and Boston College, with their only losses coming against Texas. Lafayette did not win a game in its other trips in 1954, 1958, and 1965.\nLafayette won the East Coast Conference in 1990 and Patriot League title 2007 to earn a trip to the NCAA Regionals.\nThe most noted Lafayette baseball player is former Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon, who played on the team in the early 1970s.\nMajor Leaguers.\nThe Leopards have sent 13 players to the Major Leagues. 21 Lafayette players have been drafted in the Major League Baseball draft."

The Bears are currently led by head coach Mitch Thompson, who was hired in 2022.\nHistory.\nThe early years (1902–1948).\nBaylor first fielded a baseball team in 1902 as Baylor's second varsity sport. Pitcher Ted Lyons was a player on Baylor's Southwest Conference (SWC) Championship team in 1923. He would go on to be enshrined in Cooperstown after an outstanding career with the Chicago White Sox. At this time, Lyons is the only player from a Big 12 or former SWC University to be in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Baylor did not field a baseball team from 1943 to 1945 during World War II. However, Baylor appeared in its first NCAA tournament in 1948 only in its 3rd year of play after the war.\nThe modern era (1970–2012).\nBaylor returned to the NCAA tournament in 1977, led by legendary Baylor head coach Mickey Sullivan, and advanced to the College World Series for Baylor's first appearance in Omaha. Baylor lost both of its games in the 1977 College World Series, one game each to South Carolina and Minnesota. Baylor concluded the 1977 season ranked #7 nationally by \"Collegiate Baseball\". In 1978, the Bears returned to the College World Series but lost its only 2 games again, one game each to Michigan and Miami, Fl. Baylor finished the 1978 season ranked #8 nationally by \"Collegiate Baseball\".\nBaylor has achieved a season 50-win mark in only one season in its history. This season win total was earned in 1999 under the guidance of former head coach Steve Smith, ending the season with a W-L record of 50–15. While exiting the national tournament during the Super Regional stage, the Bears ended the season ranked #8 nationally by \"Baseball America\". It was during this 1999 season that Jason Jennings won National Player of the Year. As a pitcher and designated hitter for the Bears in 1999, Jason also won the Golden Spikes Award, Dick Howser Award, Rotary Smith Award, consensus Big 12 Player of the Year and was voted a unanimous All-American. Kelly Shoppach would also earn the unanimous All-American honor as a Baylor catcher in 2001 and consensus Big 12 Player of the Year.\nBaylor's 2005 squad would become the first to win a game in Omaha. The Bears went 2–2 including wins over Oregon State and #1 ranked Tulane (a dramatic come from behind win, 7–6), but was eliminated from the tournament after its second loss to the Texas Longhorns, losing 3–4 in Baylor's final game. Baylor lost 1–5 to the Texas Longhorns in its first CWS game in 2005. Baylor finished the 2005 season ranked #4 nationally by \"Baseball America\".\nIn 2012, Baylor went 42–12 and was undefeated at home during conference play in the regular season. The Bears racked up a mid-season 24-game win streak (including an 18–0 start to conference play) which the players attributed to their adoption of a beaver that appeared along the banks of the Brazos River. \"Feeding the Beaver\" – referring to a player hitting a home-run onto the Brazos riverbank – became a year-long team slogan as the Bears earned the #4 national seed and were selected as regional hosts in the 2012 NCAA Baseball Championship tournament. In the Waco Regional, Baylor lost their first game and then won four straight games to stave off elimination and advance to host the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Super Regional. Big 12 Conference awards were won by Josh Ludy (Player of the Year) and Nathan Orf (Newcomer of the Year), Steve Smith was named Coach of the Year, and 11 Baylor players were named to All-Big 12 teams.\nBaylor has reached NCAA postseason play 18 times, including 13 of the last 15 seasons (1998–2012). The Texas Longhorns are Baylor's most played opponent, including 334 matchups through the 2011 season. Baylor has defeated the TCU Horned Frogs more than any other single opponent with 136 all-time wins.\nThe Steve Rodriguez era (2015–2022).\nIn June 2015, the Bears announced the hiring of former Pepperdine head baseball coach Steve Rodriguez. Following a 24–29 record in the 2016 season, Coach Rodriguez and the Baylor baseball team ended the 2017 season with a record of 34–23, good for 4th overall in the Big 12 and an NCAA postseason appearance.\nAccording to the Big 12 website Big12Sports, with 2 picks in the 2017 Major League Baseball (MLB) First-Year Player Draft (pick 719, Montana Parsons and pick 793, Kameron Esthay) \"Baylor has had at least one player chosen in 40 of the last 42 drafts, dating back to 1976. The Bears have a total of 138 draft choices in program history and their first multi-player draft since 2014.\"\nMemorable games.\nAmong other games in recent history, Baylor has been involved in 3 particularly memorable games.\n\"The Comeback\" game occurred on May 26, 2001, against the Rice Owls in Houston. Trailing 9–0 in the top of the 8th inning, Baylor scored 11 runs in the final 2 innings to win the game 11–10. Leading 11–9, Baylor pitching only allowed 1 run on 3 hits in the bottom of the ninth to secure the win. Former Bears and major leaguers David Murphy and Kelly Shoppach both played in this game for Baylor.\n\"The Marathon\" game was played on February 21, 1999, in Houston, TX against the Houston Cougars. This game is notable simply for its duration. Lasting 6 hours and 43 minutes, Baylor was finally victorious 8–2 after 22 innings of play. The game saw 87 plate appearances by Baylor. The game included a total of 28 different batters collecting 25 total hits, 13 different pitchers and 2 ejected coaches.\nThe \"Miracle on 13th Street\" game was played in Omaha, Nebraska at Rosenblatt Stadium on June 21, 2005, against #1 Tulane Green Wave. Trailing Tulane 7–0 in the bottom of the 7th inning, the Bears scored 8 runs in the final 3 innings to beat the Green Wave 8–7 in the nationally televised game on ESPN. The comeback was completed with a ninth-inning game-winning play that occurred with the bases loaded, 1-out, and Baylor down 7–6. The ball was hit up the middle and fielded by the 2nd baseman who fired to first to try to complete the double play. Not only was the throw late, allowing the tying run to score, but it was wild, allowing the winning run to score from 2nd.\nStadium.\nBaylor Ballpark is the current home of Baylor Baseball. The park hosted its first game on February 5, 1999, a 3–2 Baylor win over the Long Beach State Dirtbags. A replacement for outdated Ferrell Field (Baylor's on campus home park from 1977 to 1998), Baylor Ballpark was one of the finest collegiate stadiums in the country at the time of its construction during 1998. With a listed capacity of 5,000 people, the retro-styled ballpark was modeled after Plainsman Park, home field of the Auburn Tigers, which had a very similar design, but was smaller. In 2001 \"Sports Illustrated on Campus\" ranked Baylor Ballpark \"the best college baseball venue\". And the ballpark was voted as the third best collegiate baseball stadium in a 2003 poll conducted by \"Baseball America\". Baylor formerly played its home games at stadiums including Carroll Field (on campus), Katy Park (a Waco city field), Dutton Street Park (a Waco city field) and the aforementioned Ferrell Field. Baylor played its home games exclusively at Dutton Street Park from 1960 to 1976.\nThe first season for Baylor Ballpark was 1999, although construction continued throughout the season. Despite the construction, Baylor Ballpark hosted its first NCAA Regional that season. It hosted additional NCAA Regionals in 2000 and 2005 along with two NCAA Super Regionals (2000, 2005). The largest single-game attendance at Baylor Ballpark occurred on April 17, 2004, versus the Texas Longhorns, a recorded attendance of 5,602 crowded the confines to see the Longhorns overcome the Bears 7–6.\nBaylor Ballpark has been recognized as a top-tier facility for collegiate baseball. In 2003, Baseball America conducted a survey in which college coaches voted Baylor's facility the third best ballpark in the country.\n2005 Baylor Bears.\nThe 2005 Baylor Bears squad was one of the most successful teams in Baylor history. With a strong pitching staff, the squad won the Big 12 Conference and hosted both an NCAA Regional and NCAA Super Regional before advancing to the 2005 College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska.\nAt the College World Series, the Bears were defeated by the Texas Longhorns in the opening game. However, in back-to-back games, the Bears defeated the Oregon State Beavers and #1 Tulane Green Wave to set a rematch with the Longhorns. Despite leading 3–2 through the 8th inning, the Bears fell 4–3 which ended the season. Despite the loss in Omaha, the Bears were highly rated to end the season. Baseball America, Collegiate Baseball, and USA Today, along with several other publications, ranked the Bears #4 in the country to end the year.\nConference championships.\nBaylor has won or shared 5 Conference Championships.\n1923 (SWC), 1966 (SWC), 2000 (Big 12), 2005 (Big 12), 2012 (Big 12)\nBaylor has won 4 Conference Tournament championships.\n1977(SWC),1978(SWC),1993(SWC),2018(Big 12). \nBaylor has appeared in 6 Big 12 Conference Tournament championship title games.\nMajor League Baseball.\nBaylor has had 79 Major League Baseball Draft selections since the draft began in 1965."

        "text": "The New Orleans Privateers baseball team is a varsity intercollegiate athletic team of the University of New Orleans in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. The team is a member of the Southland Conference, which is part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I. The team plays its home games at Maestri Field at Privateer Park in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Privateers are coached by Blake Dean.\nHistory.\nBob Hines, first coach (1970–1971).\nFormed as early as 1970, the University of New Orleans, formerly known as Louisiana State University of New Orleans, started NCAA play in the Division II ranks. Bob Hines served as the first coach in UNO baseball history, directing the team to an 8–19 record in 1970 – its first season – followed by a 14–25 mark in 1971. The losing record in 1971 would be the last for the UNO program until Tom Schwaner's 1986 squad went 29–30. UNO defeated Southeastern Louisiana 7–6 on Mar. 13, 1970 in the first game in school history.\nThe Maestri years (1972–1985).\nIn 1972, Illinois native, Ron Maestri, was hired by then chancellor Homer Hitt as the second head coach to lead the Privateers. Following two consecutive winning seasons in the first two seasons with their new coach, the Privateers made school history in 1974 with a Division II College World Series berth. In Game 2, the Privateers recorded their first CWS win in a defeat of Valdosta State by a score of 13–9. They followed with a 6–2 win over Central Missouri State in game 6. After being bested by UC-Irvine, the Privateers bounced back to 2 consecutive wins over University of New Haven and previously unbeaten UC-Irvine. The comeback fell short, however, as the Privateers lost the final elimination game against UC-Irvine 14–1. \nOn July 1, 1975, the Privateers made the jump to Division I, hoping to build on their previous success. They joined the newly formed Sun Belt Conference in which they won the conference tournament in both 1978 and 1979 before becoming an NCAA Division I independent in 1980. After appearing in five NCAA Regionals in eight years, the Privateers finally made Louisiana sports history. In 1984, the University of New Orleans was the first in-state school to appear in the Division I College World Series. In Game 1, the Privateers were defeated by the reigning CWS champions Texas by a score of 6–3. They bounced back to defeat and ultimately eliminate Big 10 representative Michigan. In Game 10 on June 6, however, the University of New Orleans fell to Oklahoma State in 10 innings and was eliminated.\nDuring Maestri's 14 seasons as head coach, the Privateers had a winning record each year, made seven appearances in the NCAA tournament, one College World Series appearance, and won at least forty games six times, while all other coaches in the school's history have had four such seasons. The program's overall record during his tenure was 517–245–1 (.678), as he is by far the winningest coach in school history.\nTom Schwaner era (1986–1999).\nFollowing the success of Maestri, Tom Schwaner was hired as the third head coach for the Privateers. After seven years competing as Division I Independents, the Privateers would join 6 teams in the formation of the American South Conference. As members, the Privateers would win the regular season title in 1988, while winning the conference tournament in 1989. On July 1, 1991, the Privateers would join the Sun Belt Conference once again as the American South and Sun Belt Conference would merge.\nAfter a few up and down years, the Privateers would once again find success in the 1996 season by earning a trip to the South II Regional in Baton Rouge as a 5 seed. In their first game, the Privateers would defeat Georgia Tech by a score of 13–3 and would follow with a victory over cross town rival Tulane by a score of 13–5. In their third game, they would face host team LSU and would ultimately lose before being eliminated by Georgia Tech in their fifth game.\nRandy Bush (2000–2004).\nBefore the 2000 campaign, the university would hire former player and two time World Series champion, Randy Bush, as the fourth head coach of the Privateers. In his first season, the Privateers would record their first regular season title since 1988 and their first in the Sun Belt. Despite not winning the conference tournament, they would earn a 2 seed in the Baton Rouge Regional due to their success in the regular season. In their first game of the regional they would fall to Louisiana-Monroe. Facing elimination, the Privateers would defeat Jackson State before falling once again to Louisiana-Monroe.\nTom Walter and post-Katrina (2005–2009).\nTom Walter was chosen to be the fifth head coach for the Privateers. Despite the tremendous damage sustained to the East Campus of UNO, the Privateers were able to salvage a winning season and a trip to the Sun Belt Tournament. Building on their success, the Privateers were able to take the Sun Belt Conference tournament championship in 2007, a feat that had eluded them since 1979, and their first NCAA regional berth since 2000. In the NCAA regionals, the Privateers shocked host team Wichita State in the first game before losing to Arizona 9–8 and Wichita State to be eliminated.\nThe Privateers were able continue their success by making it to the SBC Championship Game before losing to the Hilltoppers of Western Kentucky. Despite not winning an automatic bid, their regular season efforts were enough to earn them a spot as a 3 seed in the Baton Rouge Regional. They would eventually lose to Southern Miss, defeat Texas Southern in game 3, and be eliminated by in game 5 by Southern Miss.\nBruce Peddie and NCAA division relocation talks (2010–2013).\nWith the exit of Tom Walter, and talks of a move to Division III or eliminating athletics all together, Assistant Coach Bruce Peddie was promoted to head coach. The Privateers compiled a 13–39 through the 2010 season in their final campaign in the Sun Belt before they officially left the conference on June 30, 2010. Despite being in division status limbo, the Privateers continued to play Division I opponents during the 2011 season as a Division I Independent and suffered another losing season.\nThe 2012 season marked the first season the baseball team would not be playing a full Division I schedule since 1975. Instead, the Privateers were accepted by the Gulf South Conference as a provisional member. As such, the Privateer baseball team played a largely Division II schedule with the exception of Nicholls State, McNeese, and Southern. On March 8, 2012, only 11 games into the 2012 season, Chancellor Peter Fos announced that the Privateers would not go through with their intention to compete as a Division II institution and would remain Division I.\nWith their Division I status reinstated, the Privateers competed in the 2013 season as Division I Independents and completed a 7–44 record. On May 31, 2013, it was reported that Bruce Peddie was relieved of his duties as head coach.\nThe return of Ron Maestri (2013–2015).\nOn July 2, 2013, UNO Athletic Director Derek Morel announced that former baseball coach and athletic director, Ron Maestri, would be returning as the head coach after a 28-year absence from coaching. On February 23, 2015, it was announced that Ron Washington was named volunteer assistant.\nOn May 19, 2015, Ron Maestri announced his retirement as head coach of the Privateers, effective July 1, 2015. Maestri finished with a 543–315–1 record with the Privateers over two stints as head coach. His Privateer teams appeared in the NCAA Division I baseball tournament nine times and in the College World Series two times.\nBlake Dean (2016–present).\nAfter being named interim coach on May 21, 2015, Blake Dean was named the seventh head baseball coach of the Privateers for the 2016 season. The team nearly won as many games as they had won the previous three seasons (31 to 33) and more than doubled their win total (from 15 to 31) in Dean's first season earning a trip to the Southland Conference tournament marking their first postseason appearance since 2008, which was the last time UNO was invited to the NCAA tournament. In his second year as head coach, the team started 5–0, and ended up defeating in-state rival LSU twice in a season for the first time since 2008. The Privateers once again reached the Southland Tournament but were eliminated by eventual champion Sam Houston State. The program won thirty games in a season in back-to-back years for the first time since the 2007–2008 seasons, and Blake Dean became the only other coach in program history besides Ron Maestri to begin their tenures with back-to-back winning seasons. Dean's 90 wins in his first three seasons trails only Tom Schwaner and Randy Bush for the most wins by a head coach in his first three seasons in school history, and is more than the previous 7 seasons combined (89) immediately preceding his arrival.\nHead coaches.\nRecords are through the end of the 2022 baseball season.\nProfessional players.\nPrivateers in the Majors.\n\"^Jason Waddell played for the Privateers in 2000 before transferring to Riverside Community College\"\nSource:\nMajor League Baseball.\nNew Orleans has had 89 Major League Baseball Draft selections since the draft began in 1965."

        "text": "The Wichita State Shockers baseball team represents Wichita State University in the sport of baseball. The Wichita State Shockers compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and in the American Athletic Conference after 72 seasons in the Missouri Valley Conference.\nThe Shockers have made the College World Series seven times, winning the national championship in 1989. Wichita State has the eighth-highest winning percentage in NCAA Division I baseball history at .655. That percentage currently leads the American Athletic Conference.\nHistory.\nEarly years: 1899–1923.\nWichita State, then Fairmount College, played its first college baseball game on April 14, 1899, against Southwestern College. For the first three years, they were coached by Harry Hess, who was also the head football coach at the time.\nOver the next two decades, the program would cycle through a number of coaches, none finding particular success or lasting more than 4 years. Wichita would produce two Major League Baseball players during that time in Claude Hendrix and Lloyd Bishop.\nAfter the 1923 season, the baseball program was shut down.\nSecond stint: 1948–1970.\nHaving since joined the Missouri Valley Conference, Wichita decided to re-launch their baseball program for the 1948 season. Over the next 23 seasons, Wichita would struggle through a number of coaching changes and middling success, only once finishing at the top of the MVC's West Division.\nAfter the 1970 season, the baseball program was again shut down.\nStephenson era: 1978–2013.\nThe modern era of Wichita State baseball began in 1977, when Oklahoma Sooners assistant coach Gene Stephenson was hired to run the program beginning with the 1978 season. Stephenson had been recruiting coordinator and hitting instructor for the Sooners under Enos Semore and helped lead Oklahoma to five College World Series appearances.\nIn just Stephenson's third season, led by three-time All-American Joe Carter, Wichita State qualified for the 1980 NCAA Division I baseball tournament, the first tournament appearance in Shocker history. In his fifth season, Stephenson led the Shockers all the way to the 1982 College World Series, where they lost to the Miami Hurricanes in the championship game. Ultimately, the Shockers won 73 games in 1982, setting the NCAA record for wins in a single season. In 1988, Stephenson again led Wichita State to the College World Series before being eliminated by the Arizona State Sun Devils in the semi-finals.\nIn 1989, led by All-Americans Eric Wedge, Greg Brummett, Mike Lansing, and Mike McDonald, the Shockers returned to the College World Series and won the national championship, defeating the Texas Longhorns in the championship game. To date, it is the only team national title ever won by a Shocker team in any sport.\nFrom 1991 to 1993, led by multi-year All-Americans Chris Wimmer, Doug Mirabelli, and Darren Dreifort, the Shockers made three consecutive trips to the College World Series, finishing as the runners-up to the LSU Tigers in both 1991 and 1993. Wichita State made their seventh and most-recent tip to the College World Series in 1996.\nSince 1996, the Shockers have had quite a bit of success, with 12 NCAA tournament appearances, including Super Regional Appearances in 2007 and 2008, but have failed to reach the same heights they found during the 1980s and 1990s. Since 1980, Wichita State trails only Florida State in total wins and winning percentage\nOn July 11, 2005, Stephenson announced he was returning to Oklahoma as head coach, but decided to return to Wichita State just hours after his introductory press conference, citing concerns with Oklahoma's scholarship situation.\nAfter 36 years, WSU fired Stephenson on June 4, 2013. Stephenson was fired after making the NCAA tournament for a 28th time, though that appearance was later stripped by the NCAA.\nPost-Stephenson era: 2014–present.\nTodd Butler was hired as just the second coach of WSU baseball's modern era 12 days after Stephenson was fired. Butler had served as an assistant at Arkansas over the past eight seasons. Butler's teams struggled initially, posting losing records in three of his first four seasons, the only three sub-.500 years since Stephenson had restarted the program.\nIn 2018, third baseman Alec Bohm was drafted in the First Round by the Philadelphia Phillies. The Shockers won 35 games in 2018, the best season under Butler.\nButler was fired following the 2019 season in which the Shockers finished 28–31 after making the semifinals of the American Athletic Conference Tournament. Butler finished his six-year tenure with a 169-180-1 record and did not make the NCAA tournament.\nIn June, 2019, former Shocker All-American catcher, and Pizza Hut Shocker Sports Hall of Famer Eric Wedge was hired as the third baseball coach in Wichita State modern era history. Wedge led the Shockers to a 13–2 season cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Shockers were ranked 30th in the country when the 2020 season was suspended and were a perfect 10–0 at Eck Stadium.\nOn April 10, 2021, the Shockers hosted the University of Houston in the first game played at Wichita's Riverfront Stadium."

        "text": "The UC Irvine Anteaters baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball program of the University of California, Irvine. The team's home venue is Cicerone Field at Anteater Ballpark located on campus in Irvine, California. UC Irvine baseball has been a member of the NCAA Division I Big West Conference since the start of the 2002 season which was the Anteaters' first season of play following the university's decision to revive its baseball program after the sport had been dropped following the 1992 season.\nThe Anteaters won the College Division national championship in 1973 and the Division II national championship in 1974. Since moving to Division I play they have appeared in the NCAA tournament nine times and the College World Series twice.\nHistory.\nCollege Division/Division II.\nThe program was founded prior to the 1970 season and initially played as an independent school in the NCAA College Division, made up of small-school athletic programs. Under head coach Gary Adams, the team qualified for the College Division Tournament in 1970, 1971, and 1972. In 1973, the team ended the regular season with a twelve-game winning streak and again qualified for the tournament. After advancing to the College Division Championship, it defeated Missouri-St. Louis, Eastern Illinois, and Ithaca twice to win a national championship.\nIn August 1973, the NCAA reorganized its divisions. Prior to then, the NCAA had competed in two divisions, a large-school University Division and a small-school College Division. Following the reorganization, the University Division became Division I, while the College Division split into Division II and Division III. UC Irvine, formerly an independent in the College Division, became a Division II Independent.\nIn the first season of Division II, the team again won its regional tournament to advance to the Division II Championship. There, the program defeated New Orleans to win its second consecutive national championship. Following the 1974 season, Gary Adams left UC Irvine to become the head coach at UCLA.\nUC Irvine continued to play in Division II until following the 1977 season, though it did not qualify for another NCAA tournament.\nTransition to Division I.\nPrior to the 1978 season, the program joined the newly formed Division I Southern California Baseball Association (SCBA). Former Gonzaga head coach Steve Hertz became the program's head coach prior to the 1979 season, in which the team finished 7th in the SCBA. In 1980, UC Irvine finished second behind Cal State Fullerton, its best season in the SCBA.\nWhen Steve Hertz returned to Gonzaga following the 1980 season, Mike Gerakos became the program's head coach. The team continued to play in the SCBA, though it finished no higher than third until the conference disbanded following the 1984 season. UC Irvine then became members of the Pacific Coast Athletic Association, which was renamed the Big West Conference prior to the 1987 season. UC Irvine had a winning conference record only twice in eight PCAA/Big West seasons through the end of the 1992 season.\nFollowing the 1992 season, state budget cuts caused the university to cut several sports programs, including baseball. At the time it was discontinued, the program had a 643-565-17 record.\nProgram revival.\nIn 2000, the university announced plans to revive the varsity baseball program and build a multimillion-dollar on-campus venue for the program. Following the 2000 college baseball season, the school hired USC assistant John Savage as the program's new head coach. The team began play in 2002. Its first game, also the opening of the newly built Anteater Ballpark, was an 8-5 loss to San Diego on January 25, 2002.\nIn 2004, the team qualified for the NCAA tournament, its first in Division I. In the South Bend Regional, the team lost consecutive games to Arizona and Notre Dame and was eliminated.\nFollowing the 2004 season, John Savage left the program to become the head coach at UCLA. UC Irvine hired Cal State Fullerton assistant coach Dave Serrano to replace him. In 2006, Serrano's second season, the team qualified for the NCAA tournament. In 2007, the team again qualified for the tournament. After defeating Texas in the Round Rock Regional finals, the Anteaters defeated Wichita State in the Super Regionals to advance to the 2007 College World Series. At the World Series, the team went 2-2 and was eliminated by eventual national champion Oregon State.\nFollowing the 2007 season, Dave Serrano returned to Cal State Fullerton to become the team's head coach. He was replaced by former USC head coach Mike Gillespie. The team qualified for the NCAA tournament in each of Gillespie's first four seasons (2008-2011). In 2008, the team was eliminated by LSU in the Super Regional round. In the team's 2009 season, the Anteaters won the Big West Championship with a 22-2 conference record and qualified for the NCAA tournament as the #6 National Seed. It hosted an NCAA Regional at Anteater Ballpark, but was eliminated in the Regional by Virginia.\nFollowing the 2009 season, Anteater Ballpark was renamed Cicerone Field at Anteater Ballpark for former UC Irvine chancellor Ralph J. Cicerone.\nIn 2010, the team qualified for the NCAA tournament but was eliminated in the regional round. In 2011, the team won the Los Angeles Regional to advance to its second super regional under Gillespie. In the super regional, the Anteaters lost to Virginia 2 games to 1.\nVenues.\nCicerone Field at Anteater Ballpark.\nCicerone Field at Anteater Ballpark has been the program's home venue since it opened in 2002, also the year in which UC Irvine sponsored varsity baseball for the first season since 1992.

        "title": "Sam Houston Bearkats baseball",
        "text": "The Sam Houston State Bearkats baseball team is a varsity intercollegiate athletic team of Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas, United States. The team is currently a member of Conference USA, an athletic conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The team plays its home games at Don Sanders Stadium.\nHistory.\nThe first Sam Houston baseball team was fielded in 1906 and was the university's first collegiate athletic team. After disbandment following their 1926 campaign, the Bearkats returned in 1947 as a member of the Lone Star Conference. The modern era for the Bearkats baseball team began in 1949, as the Sam Houston athletic department does not include any statistics prior to the season in the program's record books. Since 1949, however, Sam Houston State baseball has been one of the most productive sports out of all the university athletic programs. The Bearkats boast an overall 1732-1134-7 (.604) WLT record from 1949 through the 2012 season. The Bearkats claim one national title from the NAIA World Series in 1963.\nThe Malone years (1949–1956).\nTo begin the modern era, Hayden \"Hap\" Malone, former graduate and professor of Physical Education at SHSTC was hired as the head baseball coach in 1949. As a NAIA independent in baseball, Hap Malone's Bearkats saw mixed results in his first 6 years as the Bearkats head coach. The program was quite successful from 1949 through 1950 as the Bearkats posted a combined 24–14 record in those two seasons (15–5 and 19–9 respectively). The next two seasons saw two losing records, (11–13 and 11–14). The 1953 and 1954 seasons were both winning seasons, with the Bearkats posting a 20 win record in 1954. However, the roller coaster ride was not over and the Kats once again fell into mediocrity in 1955–56. After the 1956 season resulting in 10–18 record, their lowest win total to date, Coach Malone was relieved of his duties. Hap Malone was inducted into Sam Houston Hall of Honor in 1971.\nThe Benge supremacy (1957–1968).\nTo right the ship left by Hap Malone, Sam Houston hired Ray Benge as the new head coach of the Bearkats. Ray Benge formerly pitched for Sam Houston in the early twenties before being drafted by the Phillies and playing 12 years in the Major Leagues. Benge proved to be the cure to ail all of the Bearkats woes as his teams never saw a losing record. Benge took the Bearkats to six straight NAIA Baseball World Series appearances including one national championship win in 1963 over Grambling. He finished with a 237–102 record and was inducted into SHSU's Hall of Honor with Hap Malone in 1971.\nThe Bob Britt years (1969–1975).\nDespite being the university's shortest tenured coach (excluding current head coach David Pierce), Bob Britt continued the success of the baseball squad following Benge's departure. Like his predecessor, Britt also never head a losing season. He also coached the Bearkats to two NAIA Area Playoff berths in 1969 and 1970, and three NAIA World Series appearances in 1972, 1974, and in 1975 which all were top 3 finishes with the latter two seasons being national runner-up years. Britt also coached Sam Houston to its first two 40-win seasons in 1974 and 1975. He retired from coaching following the 1975 season, but continued to teach Physical Education as a professor at Sam Houston until 1995. Britt was inducted into Sam Houston Hall of Honor in 1979.\nThe John Skeeters era (1976–2002).\nCoach John Skeeters was Sam Houston longest tenured baseball coach with over 25 years as the Bearkats' head coach. He picked up right were Britt left off as the Skeeters led Bearkats to winning seasons in his first 16 years as head coach. During this stretch, the Bearkats saw post-season action in 9 different years, including 4 NAIA Area Playoff berths from 1979 through 1982.\nIn 1984, the Bearkats moved into NCAA Division II and stayed here for three years as an independent and later as a member of the Gulf Star Conference. In Division II, the Bearkats were selected to the regional playoffs in all three years. The Bearkats also were the Gulf Star Champions in 1985 and 1986.\nIn 1987, the Gulf Star Conference moved up into Division I. In addition to winning the Gulf Star Conference championship in 1987, Sam Houston State also earned a berth into its first Division I regional thanks to a 44–18–1 record, its highest win total to date.\nThe Bearkats moved to the Southland Conference in 1988 and while they struggled in conference play (11–10 record), they still managed to earn a winning record, finishing 32–25. Despite a rough first season in the Southland, Sam Houston quickly acclimated to its new home and won the 1989 conference championship. In addition to the championship, Sam Houston earned a berth to the NCAA regionals. Following the 1989 season, the Bearkats would not win another conference championship again until Coach Pierce took over in 2012, and would only go to the NCAA regionals once more under Coach Skeeters (1996).\nFollowing four straight losing seasons from 1999–2002, Skeeters decided to resign as head coach of the Sam Houston Bearkats. His overall mark of 860 wins and 628 losses will cement his legacy as the longest tenured coach for years to come.\nChris Rupp's Bearkats (2003–2006).\nChris Rupp was hired following Skeeters' resignation prior to the 2003 season. In his four years as head coach, Rupp's teams failed to finish with a winning season. In 2006, he resigned as the head coach and finished with an overall record of 86–123 record.\nThe Mark Johnson years (2007–2012).\nMark Johnson, former Texas A&amp;M coaching legend and member of the American Baseball Coaches Association and Texas Baseball halls of fame, took over as head coach a little more than a month after Rupp's resignation and immediately began working on improving the baseball team. Johnson brought in two full-time assistants to his coaching staff, a luxury the previous two Bearkats coaches did not have. There was seemingly no rebuilding stage for the Bearkats, as Johnson led Sam Houston to a 40–24 record his first year as coach, only a year removed from a 23–31 season under Chris Rupp. Since Johnson joined the Bearkat staff as head coach, the team saw post season action in 4 of his 5 seasons at Sam Houston, including 3 NCAA regional appearances.\nUnder David Pierce (2012–2014).\n2012.\nDavid Pierce, who joined the staff in 2011 from Rice, continued where Johnson left off, as the 2012 baseball team saw its best ever Regional finish (2nd) and coached the Bearkats to its first outright league title in 23 years. The 2012 Bearkats lost in the regional title game to Arkansas, who would eventually go on to become a Super Regional Champion to earn a berth in the College World Series. Coach Pierce would later win both the Southland Conference Coach of the Year and the ABCA Coach of the Year at the end of the season.\n2013.\nThe start of the 2013 season came with very high expectations for Coach Pierce and the Bearkats. Coming into the season, the Kats received votes in the NCBWA poll and was picked to repeat as Southland Conference champions by the Coaches' and SID polls. After a disappointing 3–4 start, the Bearkats would go on to beat then #22 ranked Texas in Austin, and then #19 ranked Rice in Houston to right the ship. Following these big games, however, Sam Houston would lose back to back series' against UCONN and Dallas Baptist. Following these games, the Bearkats went 13–8 in their next 21, including wins over #17 Rice and #19 Houston, but lost a major home series to Oral Roberts which dropped SHSU's Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) far enough down to put an at-large bid for the 2013 regionals in jeopardy. Sam Houston accepted the challenge and worked its way back to finish the season going 13–1 after the Oral Roberts series, earning the #27 spot in the Collegiate Baseball poll. On May 17, 2013, Sam Houston clinched its second straight outright Southland Conference Title with a 4–0 shutout of Central Arkansas. Following the regular season, Coach Pierce would win the Conference Coach of the Year award yet again, and would earn an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament Baton Rouge Regional after failing to win the Southland Conference Tournament. In the NCAA tournament, the Bearkats defeated Louisiana-Lafayette in the first game 4–2 behind Luke Plucheck's 3 RBIs. In the winner's bracket, Sam Houston faced regional host and #1 overall LSU Tigers. With the help of a 5 run first inning the Bearkats led the top ranked Tigers 5–4 until the 8th inning. Sam Houston could not upset the Tigers, losing in heartbreaking fashion 8–5. In the last day of the Baton Rouge regional, Sam Houston faced the Ragin' Cajuns for the second time in three days. Sam Houston would jump out to a 3–0 lead, but errors would send the Bearkats home early, as they lost the final game of the season 5–7.\nNotable players.\nMany of Sam Houston baseball players earned various awards and honors, including 95 All-Conference players, 16 All-Americans, and 7 conference award winners. Film director Richard Linklater also played baseball at Sam Houston.\nAll-Americans.\nThe Bearkats have produced 16 All-Americans across three different divisions (NAIA, NCAA D-I, and NCAA D-II). Four of these players earned the honor in multiple years.\nJackie Heard, 19741t\nJim Miller, 19741t\n\"1t denotes 1st Team selection, 2t denotes 2nd Team selection, 3t denotes 3rd Team selection, and hm denotes Honorable Mention and f denotes freshman selection\"\nPost-season awards.\nSam Houston has had multiple players earn end-of-the-season awards, such as Pitcher of the Year, Player of the Year, and Newcomer of the Year. These awards were handed out by the Gulf Star Conference from 1985 through 1987, the Southland Conference from 1988 through 2021, and the Western Athletic Conference in 2022 and 2023.\nConference honors\nIn 2001 the Bearkats set a new tournament record for runs scored in a game with 22. Third baseman Douglas Moulder and right fielder Josh Harrison both contributed with 2 home runs and 7 R.B.I.s each, also tying each other for the tournament record. Harrison also stole 3 bases in the game. For Moulder, it was his 9th multi-homer game of the season&lt; a school record. \nHarrison and Moulder are also tied for the longest home run at Bearkats Stadium. In 1998 Harrison blasted a shot 437 ft. The following year, Moulder launched a ball the same distance in his second hit as a Bearkat.\nSeven players have also been selected as the conference tournament's Most Valuable Player:\nPlayers in Major League Baseball.\nAs of the 2021 Major League Baseball season, Sam Houston has had 16 former members go on to play Major League Baseball:"

        "text": "The Troy Trojans baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball team of Troy University, located in Troy, Alabama, United States. It competes in the NCAA Division I Sun Belt Conference. The program began play in 1911. In 1986 and 1987, Troy won Division II national championships under head coach Chase Riddle. As a Division II program, the team won 10 conference titles and appeared in 14 NCAA regionals and 7 College World Series.\nAs of the end of the 2020 season, the program's overall record is 1,774–1,114–3. Troy is the 36th all-time winningest baseball program among all Division 1 programs.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nFew schools in the South, especially in the state of Alabama, possess as rich a history as that of the Troy baseball program. In the past 40 years alone, Trojan baseball squads have claimed more than 1,300 victories, 14 conference championships, 7 NCAA regional crowns, and back-to-back Division II NCAA National Championships in 1986 and 1987.\nAs early as the turn of the 20th century, old photographs show evidence that Troy fielded an intercollegiate baseball team in the early 1900s, but school records only date back to 1931. In the teams early years, they were known as the \"Teachers\" since the college was primarily an educational institution for teachers. In 1931, the Troy Normal School moved all home games to what is now known as Riddle-Pace Field. The previous playing field, which was located on the quad in front of Shackelford Hall, was the original playing field. This relocation occurred because of baseballs breaking the windows of Shackelford Hall.\nChase Riddle era.\nIn 1979, Troy State hired Chase Riddle, who was a manager and scout for the St. Louis Cardinals major league baseball team. In his first year as the head coach, he led the Trojans to a then-school-record 33 wins and a second place finish in the Gulf South Conference Eastern Division. That same season, Troy performed a two-game sweep of the Alabama Crimson Tide; a big accomplishment for an in-state Division II school.\nIn Riddle's second season at the helm, he went on to accomplish even more. His 1980 team finished the season 30–12, garnering a significant win over the then #7-ranked Florida State Seminoles by a score of 5–3. The Trojans would wind up winning the Gulf South Conference championship and the NCAA Central Regional, and making it all the way to the NCAA College World Series. They were eliminated with a 1–2 record from the World Series, but Troy had established themselves as a new powerhouse baseball program.\nThe 1981 and 1982 seasons were also huge successes for Riddle and his program. The program won another Gulf South Conference championship in 1981 with yet another appearance in the College World Series, finishing the season with a 37–10 record. The 1982 season would be nearly a copy of the previous season, with Troy winning yet another conference championship and making it to the College World Series yet again. Troy would also garner big wins against Auburn and Clemson that same year.\nFrom 1983 to 1985, the Trojans would go 105–42, making three NCAA regional appearances and two College World Series appearances.\nIn 1986, the Trojans defeated Columbus State, 5–0, to win their first NCAA College World Series (Division II). They finished the season as the #1-ranked team in the country, with a 46–8 overall record, and a 12–0 conference record to win another Gulf South Conference title. In 1987, they followed up with yet another national championship by defeating Tampa, 7–5. For his successes, head coach Chase Riddle was named National Head Coach of the Year by the American Baseball Coaches Association in 1986 and 1987.\nChase Riddle would wind up retiring in 1990, finishing his notable career with a record of 434–149–2. Less than one year after his retirement, Riddle's #25 jersey that he wore was retired. Riddle was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 2000, the Wiregrass Sports Hall of Fame in 2005, and later into the Troy Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.\nJohn Mayotte era.\nUpon transitioning from Division II to Division I, the Trojans finished their tenure in Division II with a 38–25 overall record against competition in NCAA postseason play.\nIn the Trojan's last season of play in Division II, coach John Mayotte helped continue the trend of Trojan baseball success, leading the team to another College World Series appearance, only to be eliminated with a 2–2 record. The Trojans finished that season ranked #3 in the nation.\nAfter coach Mayotte helped lead Troy into their new era of Division I baseball, he led the team to their first Division I NCAA regional in 1995, just Troy's second season of being in Division I. Troy was eliminated in the Regional by Florida State and Ole Miss that season. In 1997, Mayotte once again led Troy to another NCAA regional, where Troy was again eliminated, this time by Alabama and Southern California.\nBobby Pierce era.\nIn 2003, Troy hired Bobby Pierce as head coach. In his 4th season (2006), he led Troy to their 3rd ever appearance in an NCAA regional. In what would become one of Pierce's best seasons, his Trojans went 47–16 and won their first Sun Belt Conference championship. They entered into the Tuscaloosa Regional as the #2-seed team, while also holding a national ranking of #27 by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association. Troy would face #3-seed Southern Miss in the first matchup, with Troy scoring their first victory in a Regional since joining Division I, beating Southern Miss by a score of 10–8. Troy would fall to #1-seed Alabama in the next round, only to face Southern Miss and beating them yet again. Troy would finally be eliminated from the Regional by Alabama in the final game. Three players from the 2006 team were taken that year in the MLB Draft: Tom King, Mike Felix, and Jarred Keel.\nThe Trojans went on to have a lot of success over the years since that 2006 season, finding themselves ranked in the Top 25 occasionally almost every season, yet never finishing with a national ranking. That trend would change in 2013.\nThe 2013 season saw Troy have one of its strongest batting lineups in the program's history. The Trojans were in the Top 10 in the NCAA in total home runs, hitting 54 that season. After getting big wins over Texas Tech and Auburn during the season, the Trojans won another Sun Belt Conference championship, going 40–18 during the regular season. Troy would be ranked #26 by \"Collegiate Baseball\" going into the Tallahassee Regional, garnering them the #3-seed. They would face Alabama in the first round, defeating the Crimson Tide 5–2, only to lose to Florida State in the next round. After being put into the elimination bracket, Troy had to once again face the Alabama Crimson Tide. The Trojans would defeat the Tide yet again, this time in a thriller by a score of 9–8. Troy faced Florida State in the finals of the Regional, but wound up being eliminated by the Seminoles, 4–11.\nThe Trojans would finish the 2013 season with their first ever Top 25 rankings, being ranked #23 by \"Collegiate Baseball\" and #25 by \"Baseball America\".\nBobby Pierce finished his career with a 450–313 record at Troy, leading the program to their first Top 25 finish and 4 NCAA regional appearances. For his accomplishments, Pierce was inducted into the Alabama Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame in 2010, the Wiregrass Hall of Fame in 2017, and the Troy Sports Hall of Fame in 2018.\nMark Smartt era.\nAfter the 2016 season, long-time assistant coach Mark Smartt was hired as Troy's new head coach. Smartt is a Troy University alumnus and was a member of the Troy State Trojans baseball teams that was Division II national championships in 1986 and 1987.\nIn Smartt's second season at the helm, his team would go 31–25, performing a rare accomplishment by defeating every in-state on the schedule in 2017. The Trojans would defeat Alabama, Auburn, UAB, South Alabama, Alabama State, Samford, and Jacksonville State that season.\nIn 2018, in just Smartt's third season as head coach, he led Troy to a 2nd-place finish in the Sun Belt Conference and finished with a 42–21 record that season. The team would make it all the way to the Sun Belt Conference Tournament finals against #19 Coastal Carolina, only to lose 6–11 to the Chanticleers. Troy wound up receiving an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, where they would face #18 Duke in the first round, defeating the Blue Devils by a score of 6–0. The Trojans' fortunes would fade from there though, losing to #9 Georgia in the next round, and finally being eliminated in a re-match with Duke. Troy finished the season with the sixth-most wins in school history, while garnering a few wins over Top 25 ranked teams, including #17 Coastal Carolina, #18 Duke, and #22 Auburn.\nRiddle-Pace Field.\nRiddle-Pace Field, located on the university's campus, is the program's home venue. It is named for Chase Riddle, former head coach of the program, and Matthew Downer Pace, who served Troy University from 1891 to 1941 as Professor of Mathematics, Dean, and President.\nThe stadium features a brick concourse, a three-story press box, restrooms, a concession stand, and a merchandise booth. The stadium has a capacity of 2,000 spectators, which includes 1,700 bleacher seats and 300 chair-back seats. More spectator areas are located beyond the left field fence and adjacent to the home plate dugout. The Lott Baseball Complex was built along the left field fence, which houses coaches offices, player locker rooms and lounge, and an indoor batting cage.\nThe field had its grass turf removed and was replaced with artificial grass turf in 2008. Troy was one of only three college baseball programs at the time to switch from grass fields to artificial turf. A state-of-the-art drainage system was installed with the new artificial turf, lending the Troy baseball team the ability to play games in a very short amount of time after heavy rains come through.\nThe field has become known for its \"Monster\" wall in right field, a 27-foot tall black wall with a built-in scoreboard and video board. It's currently one of the largest outfield walls in all of college baseball.\nAttendance.\nAttendance Rankings.\nTroy has been ranked in the NCAA's Top 50 for annual average home attendance for multiple seasons since the early 2000s.\nAttendance Records.\nBelow is a list of Troy's top six single-game attendance figures.\nAll-Americans.\nTroy has produced 58 All-American players, as well as 6 Academic All-Americans.

In Troy's last season in the Atlantic Sun Conference in 2005, they won the regular season title. Since joining the Sun Belt Conference, the team has won three regular season titles in 2006, 2011, and 2013. Troy also won the SBC tournament title in 2006.\nThe program has compiled a total of 20 conference championships and two D-II national championships since its inception.\nDivision II national championships.\nIn 1986, the Trojans defeated Columbus State, 5–0, to win the Division II College World Series.

        "text": "The Dubai International Stadium, formerly known as the Dubai Sports City Cricket Stadium, is a multi-purpose stadium in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is mainly used for cricket and is one of the three main cricket stadiums in the country, the other two being Sharjah Cricket Stadium in Sharjah and Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi. It has seating capacity for 25,000 spectators, but is expandable to accommodate 30,000 spectators. It is a part of the Dubai Sports City in Dubai. The architect of this project was the Canadian architect, Awsam Matloob. The stadium was one of the dedicated venues for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, it hosted Semi Final 2 and the Final on November 11, 2021 and November 14, 2021 respectively.\nStadium History.\nThe first ODI cricket match played here was between Australia and Pakistan on April 22, 2009; it was won by Pakistan. The stadium's first player to take a five-wicket haul was Shahid Afridi with 6/38, which was his career best figures at the time. The top score at this stadium is 302* is held by Azhar Ali against West Indies in 2016.\nThe stadium hosted its first Test match when Pakistan played South Africa on 12–16 November 2010; the match resulted in a draw.\nThe November 2010 ODI series between Pakistan and South Africa ended with a 3–2 series win for South Africa. South Africa sealed the series with a 57 run win against Pakistan.\nPakistan held a series against New Zealand and one Twenty20 International against England. This followed with a five-match ODI series of which three matches were played at this stadium. The second match in the stadium was also the last match by Australian international all-rounder Andrew Symonds.\nIn 2012 Pakistan met England in the first test at Dubai. Pakistan won it easily, by 10 wickets. Saeed Ajmal was the Man-of-the-Match, after his outstanding 10 wicket haul.\nIn 2012 in mid-August Pakistan played three T20s against Australia, which was a grand success, just before the ICC World T20, including a super over in the final match, which Pakistan won.\nIn 2014, The 2014 Indian Premier League tournament was held in the stadium along with Zayed Cricket Stadium and Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium. After that, the tournament shifted back to homeland India.\nIn September 2019, it was named as one of the venues to host cricket matches for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament.\nAlong with Abu Dhabi and Sharjah the stadium was used to host the IPL 2020 as well as the second half of the 2021 tournament after it was initially postponed following a Covid-19 outbreak in India. In IPL 2020 Dubai International Stadium played host to the final as Mumbai Indians defeated Delhi Capitals and in 2021 Chennai Super Kings defeated Kolkata Knight Riders in finals.\nThe pitch conditions in Dubai for T20 cricket were significantly improved during IPL 2020 a fact born out by the higher average T20 score in Dubai that was witnessed in that tournament by comparison to matches in the past.\nLighting system.\nThe Dubai International Stadium is lit by a special system of floodlights named \"Ring of Fire\". The 350 floodlights are fixed around the circumference of its round roof, thereby minimizing the shadows of objects in the ground and having no floodlight towers."

        "title": "Ironman World Championship",
        "text": "The Ironman World Championship is a triathlon held annually in Hawaii, United States since 1978, with an additional race in 1982. It is owned and organized by the World Triathlon Corporation. It is the annual culmination of a series of Ironman triathlon qualification races held throughout the world. As of 2023, Ironman World Championships split between Kona and France, with the men's and women's races rotating years.\nHistory.\nFrom 1978 through 1980 the race was held on the island of Oahu, the course combining that of three events already held there: the Waikiki Roughwater Swim (2.4 mi./3.86 km), the Around-Oahu Bike Race (115 mi./185.07 km, originally a two-day event), and the Honolulu Marathon. The bike stage was reduced by 3 miles to link it to the start of the marathon course. In 1981 the race was moved to the less urbanized Big Island, keeping the distances the same: a open water swim in Kailua-Kona Bay, a bike ride across the Hawaiian lava desert to Hāwī and back, and a marathon (26 miles 385 yards, 42.195 km) run along the coast of the Big Island from Keauhou to Keahole Point and back to Kailua-Kona, finishing on Alii Drive.\nSince 1982, the race has been held in the fall each year, before which it was held in the spring, giving two races in 1982. The most recent Ironman World Championship took place on 8 October 2022, following a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualifying for the World Championship is achieved through placement in one of the other Ironman races or some Ironman 70.3 races. Because of COVID-19, the 2020 race was initially postponed to February 2021. However, the race was ultimately canceled with that year's qualifiers able to defer to race in 2021 or 2022.\nThe current Ironman Hawaii course record was set in 2022 by Gustav Iden (Norway), whose winning time was 7 hrs 40 min 24 sec. The women's course record is 8 hrs 24 mins 31 sec, set in 2023 by Lucy Charles-Barclay (UK).\nAthletes with disabilities compete in the event in the physically challenged category, which was instituted in 1997, and are required to meet the same cutoff times as able bodied competitors. Australian John Maclean was the first physically challenged athlete to complete the event under the cut-off time.\nSince 2022, Vietnam's automobile maker VinFast was the first ever naming rights partner for 2022 Ironman World Championship and 2023 Ironman 70.3 World Championship.\nMedalists.\nMen.\n‡The 2021 World Championship was held in St. George, Utah on May 7, 2022. The delay and change from the original Kona, Hawaii venue were due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWomen.\n†Paula Newby Fraser was a citizen and represented the United States for the 1996 race\n‡The 2021 World Championship was held in St. George, Utah on May 7, 2022. The delay and change from the original Kona, Hawaii venue were due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs of 2023 the Men's Championship alternates with the Women's Championship at Kona, Hawaii and Nice, France.\nIronman lottery.\nUntil 2015, individuals could enter a lottery for the chance to participate in the Ironman World Championship. The lottery entry fee was $50 and afforded the chance to win one of 100 berths in the championship race. If selected the winners then had to pay the normal entry fee.\nHowever, according to a sworn complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida, Ironman illegally charged athletes for a chance to win the opportunity to compete in the Ironman World Championship. According to Florida law, the state where the World Triathlon Corporation resides, it is illegal to set up and charge for a lottery. Because WTC charged a $50 fee to enter the lottery, instead of giving away the opportunity to win a slot at the championships, they were in violation of this law. Following the complaint WTC cooperated with the United States Attorneys office and the FBI's investigation of the matter and agreed to forfeit $2,761,910, the amount collected from the lottery since October 24, 2012. The attorney representing the United States in the matter was 8-time Ironman finisher James A. Muench.\nWinners of the 2015 lottery were notified on March 17, 2015, prior to the announcement of the complaint. WTC stated that these winners would be unaffected by this decision and that their slots for the upcoming championship race would be honored."

However, in December 2008, it was announced that Nottingham would take over from Surbiton, in hosting the grass court ATP Challenger and ITF event.

The win gave John Cook his first national title in just his first year as Nebraska's head coach. Wisconsin, for whom Cook was the previous head coach, made the program's first Final Four appearance. \nThis was the last season that the NCAA used side out scoring, switching to rally scoring in 2001.\nRecords.\nFor the third straight year, the tournament field remained fixed at 64 teams. The Big Ten, Big 12, and Pac-10 tied for the most bids in the 2000 NCAA Tournament with six bids each.

        "text": "The 1999 NCAA Division I women's volleyball tournament began on December 2, 1999, with 64 teams and ended December 18 when Penn State defeated Stanford in Honolulu, Hawaii, for the program's first NCAA title.\nPenn State, appearing in their third straight title match, crushed Stanford in three games to claim the school's first ever national championship. The Lions had fallen short in five games the previous two years, falling to Stanford in 1997 and Long Beach State in 1998.\nRecords.\nThe tournament field remained steady at 64 teams for a second straight year. The Big Ten led the way with eight bids in the 1999 NCAA Tournament, followed by the Big 12 with six bids and the Pac-10 with five bids. This was the last year to feature teams regionally seeded from 1-4. Bracket-wide seeding from 1-16 would begin in 2000. The Final Four was held in Hawaii for the first time since 1989, and has not been held outside the 48 contiguous states since.\nNational Semifinals.\nPenn State vs. Pacific.\nPenn State reached their third consecutive final after outlasting Pacific in five games. The Nittany Lions were paced by senior All-American Lauren Cacciamani with 26 kills, six blocks and a .304 attack percentage. Pacific was led by Elsa Stegemann who had a match high 31 kills. Pacific ended their season 32-3.\nStanford vs. Long Beach State.\nBehind freshman Logan Tom's 27 kills, Stanford downed defending national champion Long Beach State in three games.\nLong Beach State opened the match scoring the first two points of game 1, but Stanford would control it from there, scoring eight straight points. In game 2, Stanford trailed 6-3 but took six of the next seven points to take the 9-7 lead. A service ace would seal game two for the Cardinal. Stanford dominated game 3, scoring the first 13 points before taking it 15-3.\nNational Championship: Penn State vs. Stanford.\nAppearing in the program's third straight title match, the top ranked Penn State Nittany Lions crushed second ranked Stanford in three sets to claim the school's first national title.\nIn game 1, Penn State jumped out to the 8-0 lead, before taking the first game 15-2. The Lions had 10 team blocks in game 1 alone, and hit .258 in game 1. Stanford had 19 hitting errors in the opening game.\nStanford jumped out to the 3-1 lead in game 2, but Penn State tied the game up at 6. After that, Penn State scored six straight points to take the 12-6 lead. Stanford would get no closer than three points, as Penn State took game 2 15-10.\nPenn State lead 7-6 in game 3, and eventually stretched the lead to 11-6. Stanford scored their last point on a Lion hitting error, as Penn State scored the final four points. A Stanford hitting error that sailed wide sealed the national championship for Penn State, 15-7.\nPenn State's Lauren Cacciamani, the co-AVCA National Player of the Year with Kerri Walsh, had 20 kills and hit .344, while Walsh hit .000 with 11 kills and 11 errors. As a team, Stanford hit negative .008 (39 kills, 40 errors) while Penn State hit .240 (48 kills, 19 errors).\nAfter losing their first match of the season, the Nittany Lions reeled off 36 consecutive wins. The win gave Russ Rose his first NCAA title as the Penn State head coach after three previous runner-up finishes, while Stanford finished as NCAA runners-up for the fourth time in school history.\nNCAA Tournament records.\nThere is one NCAA tournament record that was set in the 1999 tournament that still stands."

        "title": "Arizona Wildcats baseball",
        "text": "The Arizona Wildcats baseball team is the intercollegiate men's baseball program representing the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, United States. They compete in the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12) of NCAA Division I. On August 4, 2023, Arizona announced it would join the Big 12 Conference along with Arizona State, Colorado, and Utah beginning in the 2024-25 academic year.\nArizona has won four college baseball national championships (1976, 1980, 1986 and 2012), the first three under Jerry Kindall and the most recent under Andy Lopez. The team has appeared in the College World Series Championship Game or Series on four other occasions (1956, 1959, 1963, and 2016). The Wildcats have appeared in 40 baseball tournaments in their rich history. Arizona ranks ninth in all-time wins and eight in all-time win percentage, with an all-time record of 2,955–1,604–22 () as of the 2022 season. Arizona fielded its first team in 1905.\nVenues.\nJerry Kindall Field at Frank Sancet Stadium.\nThe former home of Arizona baseball is Jerry Kindall Field at Frank Sancet Stadium. The park is located on the campus of the University of Arizona, adjacent to the McKale Center, home of the UA athletics department. Arizona played its games at the Kindall Field from prior to the 1967 season through the end of the 2011 season. Modernization of the facility was completed for the 1975 season. Originally called Wildcat Field, the park was officially dedicated Frank Sancet Field on April 19, 1986, in honor of Arizona's longtime head coach. Sancet, who coached from 1950–72, posted an 831–283–8 (.744) mark at the helm of the Cats.\nRelocation to Hi Corbett Field.\nIn an effort to have the Wildcat baseball program compete in the best possible facilities, in August 2011, the UA signed an agreement with the city of Tucson for Arizona baseball to play its home games at city-owned Hi Corbett Field, located about three miles southeast of campus, for the 2012 season (beginning with a five-year lease with an option to renew for an additional five years). The UA spent about $350,000 to make several upgrades to the former spring training facility (used as such by the Cleveland Indians and the Colorado Rockies), where the Wildcats previously played selected games in the 1960s and '70s. Through the first three-game series of the 2012 season against North Dakota State, the attendance at the stadium was a total of 8,870, which was nearly 1/4th of the total home attendance for the Wildcats' previous season at Sancet Stadium.\nIn 2012, the Wildcats posted a 38–17 regular season record (20–10 in Pac-12 conference play), capturing a share of the Pac-12 baseball championship, the school's first league title since 1992. As a result, Hi Corbett Field hosted both an NCAA Regional and Super Regional tournament, and Arizona won both of those to advance to the 2012 College World Series (the program's first postseason appearance in Omaha since 2004) where the team won its fourth national championship. In the 2012 season, the team brought in almost $350,000 in ticket revenue (not including revenue for tickets sold during the NCAA Regional or Super Regional); this is compared to the 2011 season, when Arizona baseball brought in $69,000 worth of ticket revenue in its final season at Sancet Stadium. The relocation of the Wildcat baseball program to Hi Corbett Field has been noted as a major factor in the team's successful 2012 season.\nIn March 2017, the University signed a 25-year lease on Hi Corbett Field, taking over the day-to-day management of the baseball stadium from the City of Tucson.\nIndividual honors.\nRetired jerseys.\nStudent-Athlete jerseys are retired but not individual player numbers.\nRivalries.\nArizona State.\nArizona’s main rival is Arizona State. Although they are famously known for their rivalry in football and basketball as well as softball, both schools have had a rich baseball tradition in their history. The Wildcats lead the Sun Devils in all time baseball series 260–227–1 as of May 2023 and both teams have had several players drafted into MLB. \nIn recent years, Arizona has had an edge over Arizona State in college baseball success. In 2010 ASU won the Pac-10 and also advanced to the College World Series, capping the end of a dominating run of 4 straight Pac-10 conference championships and 3 CWS appearances in 4 years (missed CWS in 2008). Later, the NCAA would vacate the 2007 Pac-10 Championship and 2007 CWS appearance from ASU's record. \nSince then Arizona has won the CWS (2012), was the CWS runner-up (2016) and won the Pac-12 Championship (2021). In contrast to Arizona's recent success, ASU has not won the Pac-10/12 Conference since 2010, has not been the CWS runner up since 1988 and has not won a NCAA Championship since 1981. Arizona has won 2 NCAA championships since 1981. While ASU still has a more robust historical record (5x NCAA Champs, 1965, 1967, 1969, 1977, 1981 and 21x CWS appearances), Arizona has narrowed that gap in the last 10 years."

Founded in 1923, The Meraloma Club originated as a swim club before branching out with an array of other sports including rugby. The rugby club currently competes in the British Columbia Premier Rugby League.\nHistory.\nEstablished in 1923 as a swim club the Meraloma Club was originally named the Mermaid Athletic Club before adding canadian football, rugby union and other sports. With the inclusion of new sports came the development of a new name. By taking \"Mer\" from the original Mermaids name and adding \"al\" from alpha, \"om\" from omega (the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet) and \"a\" from \"always\" that was interpreted to mean \"Mermaids, first, last and always\"; reflected in the club motto \"Once a Meraloma, Always a Meraloma\". Thus, the Mermaid Athletic Club became the Meraloma Club.\nThe Rugby Section of the Meraloma Club has had tremendous success, both on a team, &amp; individual level, with numerous premiership titles for the club. Players for the Meraloma's also compete at both the Provincial &amp; National Levels. The Meraloma's most recent Rounsefell Cup win came in 2009. The team also managed to make it to the 2011 B.C. Rugby Premier League final but eventually lost out to Castaway Wanderers RFC by a score of 20-3.\nWomen's sports returned to the club in 1973 after a 45-year absence, at first in the form of field-hockey and eventually, soccer, basketball, volleyball, touch football and rugby. The club currently has over 600 active male and female members in 6 sport sections. Over half of the members of the Meraloma Club are involved in Rugby.\nIn 2021 the Rugby Club added the Vancouver Rogues as their 2nd team in their 3rd Division men's team. It's inclusive to players of all sexual orientations and gender identities and is part of the IGR. In 2022 the team participated in the Bingham Cup and was the top Canadian Team that participated. \nFacilities.\nThe Meraloma Club is housed in a 1923 Parks &amp; Recreation vintage structure, on Connaught Park, Kitsilano which it continues to renovate and maintain. A Heritage Award from the City of Vancouver was earned in 1979 for preserving architectural integrity during renovations."

Members of the Pac-12 Conference in NCAA Division I, the team plays home games on campus at Gill Coliseum, and the current head coach is Wayne Tinkle.\nOregon State has won 14 conference championships and appeared in the NCAA tournament 18 times (three \n(1980–82) were later vacated by the NCAA). The Beavers have advanced to the Final Four twice (1949, 1963), and their most recent tournament appearance was in 2021, when they advanced to the Elite Eight after winning their first tournament games since 1982.\nCoaches.\nThe Oregon State men's basketball team has had 21 head coaches, with one interim (2008). Both Amory T. \"Slats\" Gill and Ralph Miller are members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Craig Robinson, the coach preceding Wayne Tinkle, was hired by OSU in 2008 out of Brown University, where he had just coached the Bears to a school-record 19 wins. Robinson is the brother of United States first lady Michelle Obama, and the brother-in-law to United States President Barack Obama. The longest-tenured head coach was Slats Gill, who was the coach for 36 seasons, winning 599 games during his time at OSU. The current coach, Wayne Tinkle, was hired by OSU in 2014 from the University of Montana – Missoula, where he coached the Montana Grizzlies to two Big Sky Conference championships and a school-record 25 wins.\nHistory.\n1980–83 – Orange Express.\nThe 1980–81 Oregon State men's basketball season was arguably one of the best yet most upsetting basketball seasons in Oregon State history. The team was referred to as the Orange Express and was led by Beaver legendary coach Ralph Miller. The Orange Express season was led by Beaver great, Steve Johnson, in his last year at OSU, and the Beavers were second in the final polls, released prior to the NCAA tournament. This was the first time in OSU history that the Beavers won at UCLA, and the Orange Express spent a school record eight weeks ranked first in at least one of the AP and Coaches Polls. At the end of the regular season, the Beavers were and entered the 48-team NCAA tournament as the top seed in the West region. They had a bye in the first round, but were upset in their opening game by #8 seed Kansas State 50–48 in the second round, at Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles. Miller was awarded UPI and AP Coach of the Year honors and Steve Johnson received All-American honors.\nFor three seasons beginning in 1980–81, OSU posted an overall record of , second only to DePaul's 79–6 record over the same seasons. The Beavers' record included a home record at Gill Coliseum, including a school best 24 consecutive home wins.\nHowever, NCAA sanctions followed these standout teams. The NCAA found that many players, from 1979 to 1983 were involved in improper arrangements with outside representative related to the purchase of complimentary basketball tickets and the receipt of other prohibited benefits. The NCAA vacated appearances from the 1980, 1981, and 1982 tournaments.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Beavers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 18 times. Their combined record is 15–21. OSU had three NCAA Tournament appearances (1980, 1981 and 1982) vacated by the NCAA, resulting in 15 recognized appearances and an \"official\" NCAA Tournament record of 13–18. Their former 46-year drought between wins was the longest drought of any team from a major conference. \nNIT results.\nThe Beavers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) four times, with a combined record of 3–4.\nCBI results.\nThe Beavers have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) four times.Their combined record is 7–4, and they were the champions in 2009.\nRivalries.\nOregon Ducks — Oregon State's main rivalry (the Civil War) is with the Ducks.\nWashington Huskies — The Dog Fight is one of Oregon State's lesser known rivalry games.\nWashington State Cougars — As land-grant universities, WSU and OSU have a longtime regional rivalry.\nArizona Wildcats – The Cat's Meow was coined during the Ralph Miller era when the Beavers would match-up against famed-coach Lute Olson's squad.\nNotable players.\nOregon State has had 75 all-conference and 32 All-America selections, five Pac-10 Players of the Year, 42 players selected in the NBA draft, and 24 players that have gone on to play in the NBA. Additionally, OSU basketball alumni have 4 gold medals at the Olympics, including one by Lew Beck, who never played in the NBA. A total of 9 players have won 13 NBA titles, including three by A.C.

        "title": "Ray Lindwall with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Ray Lindwall was a key member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948. The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\".\nLindwall played as a right-arm opening fast bowler and right-handed batsman in the lower middle-order. Along with Keith Miller, Lindwall formed Australia's first-choice pace duo, regarded as one of the best of all time, and Bradman typically used them in short and sharp bursts against the home batsmen. The pair were used to target England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton during the major matches, and subdued Hutton for much of the summer. England had agreed to make a new ball available after every 55 overs, more often than the usual regulations at the time, thereby allowing the pair more frequent use of a shiny ball that swung at high pace. Bradman gave the duo lighter workloads in the tour matches in order to preserve their energy for the new ball battles against England's key batsmen in the Tests. Lindwall was a capable lower-order batsman who made two Test centuries during his career, and he featured in several rearguard actions that boosted Australia's scores during the tour.\nLindwall was the equal leading wicket-taker in the Tests (27 along with Bill Johnston) and had the best bowling average (19.62) and strike rate. In the first-class matches, he led the averages although he was second in the wicket-taking list with 86 at 15.68 behind Johnston (102), who was assigned more of the workload in order to keep Miller and Lindwall fresh for the Tests. With the bat, Lindwall scored 191 runs at a batting average of 31.83 in the Tests.\nLindwall's most influential contributions in the Ashes matches were his 5/70 in the first innings of the Second Test at Lord's, a hard-hitting 77 that limited Australia's first innings deficit in the Fourth Test at Headingley, and most notably, his 6/20 on the first day of the Fifth Test at The Oval. The performance was a display of extreme pace and swing that earned high praise from pundits and was largely responsible for England being bowled out for 52. Outside the Tests, Lindwall took 11/59 in a match against Sussex, with eight of his victims being bowled as the ball curved through their defences at high pace. In recognition of his achievements, Lindwall was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. \"Wisden\" said that \"by whatever standard he is judged ... [Lindwall] must be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers\".\nBackground.\nA bowler of express pace, Lindwall was a regular member of the Test team and had opened Australia's attack since the resumption of cricket following World War II. During the Australian summer of 1947–48, Lindwall played in all five Tests against the touring India national cricket team. He played a major part in Australia's 4–0 series win as the leading wicket-taker with 18 scalps at an average of 16.88, ahead of Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston who took 16 apiece at averages of 16.31 and 11.37 respectively. As a result, Lindwall was selected as part of Don Bradman's \"Invincibles\" that toured England without defeat in 1948, with the intention of leading the pace attack. There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead-up to the tour. Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon and his foot drag during the delivery stride led to discussion in the media and among umpires as to its legality. Bradman arranged for Lindwall to see his Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman's leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman emphasized the importance of caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence for the rest of the season.\nEarly tour.\nIn the lead-up to the match against Worcestershire, photographers and cameramen constantly followed Lindwall, trying to capture visual evidence of an illegal drag when he was bowling in the practice nets. Bradman tried to stop the journalists from taking photographs of the crease as Lindwall came in to bowl, and deflected media questions about his bowler's drag. The spectators and media were keenly observing the position of his foot in the tour opener, but Lindwall was not no-balled in the first match at Worcester, and complaints about his drag faded away for the rest of the tour. The hosts elected to bat first, and Lindwall took 2/41 in the first innings, bowling and trapping his victims leg before wicket before delivering three wicketless overs for 19 runs in the second innings. Lindwall took a wicket with his second ball in England, trapping Don Kenyon for a duck to leave the hosts at 1/0. He was promoted to No. 4 as Bradman rotated his batting order and he scored a quickfire 32 from 34 balls with six boundaries before Australia completed an innings victory. According to former Australian Test batsman and journalist Jack Fingleton, Lindwall \"took things very quietly ... The fast bowler is very wise who builds up his speed match by match\". With the media and public attention now focused on actual bowling, Lindwall's classical bowling action evoked almost as much interest as his captain's batting.\nBradman rested Lindwall for the second tour match against Leicestershire, which ended in an innings victory for the Australians. Lindwall returned for the next fixture against Yorkshire at Bradford, but bowled only nine overs for a total of 1/16. He made a duck in the first innings on a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling, as Australia scraped home by four wickets. Lindwall was due in next when Australia collapsed to 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory in the second innings. The tourists were effectively seven wickets down with the injured Sam Loxton unable to bat, but Neil Harvey and Don Tallon saw Australia to the target without further loss. It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour. The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval. They batted first and Lindwall managed only four, clean bowled by Alec Bedser, as Australia amassed 632. He then took the first two wickets to reduce Surrey to 2/15 in the first innings. Bradman used Lindwall sparingly, taking a match total of 3/45 from 25 overs as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Fingleton felt that Lindwall was at his fastest for the season during the Surrey match. One of Lindwall's bouncers flew over three feet above the batsman's head.\nLindwall had another light workout in the match against Cambridge University, taking match figures of 1/33 from nine overs. His solitary wicket was that of Doug Insole, and he was not required to bat as Australia completed another innings victory. After the fixture against Cambridge, Lindwall was rested for two consecutive matches. In the first, Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the summer. The second match resulted in another innings victory, this time over Oxford University.\nLindwall was brought back for the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia selected their first-choice team. It was a chance for the Australian pace attack to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrich—three of England's first four batsmen—all playing. Australia batted first and Lindwall scored 29, including three sixes from the bowling of England Test off spinner Jim Laker. After Australia amassed 552, Lindwall took combined figures of 2/68, removing Compton and England and MCC captain Norman Yardley as the tourists enforced the follow on by an innings and 158 runs. The MCC fixture was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour against Lancashire. After the first day was washed out, Lindwall made a duck and then took 3/44, removing Test players Ken Cranston and Jack Ikin during the hosts' only innings. He was not required to bat in the second innings as the match petered into a draw on the final day.\nIn the next match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, Lindwall took 6/14 to gain a psychological blow ahead of the First Test to be held at the same venue. After taking the first four wickets and cutting through the top-order, the paceman returned to finish off the tail and ensure the hosts were dismissed for 179. Lindwall bowled three of his victims with fast and swinging yorkers. He delivered 91 balls, conceding less than a run per over. Only ten of his balls were scored from and not a single run was taken from his last 30 balls. Fingleton said that Lindwall \"absolutely paralysed\" the batsmen, with some of his bowling \"in the real Larwood manner\". Harold Larwood was a Nottinghamshire express pace bowler of the 1920s and 1930s who led the controversial Bodyline attack in Australia in 1932–33, and Lindwall modelled his bowling action on Larwood after seeing him in action at the Sydney Cricket Ground during the tour. Lindwall could only manage eight runs with the bat and was unable to repeat his incisive bowling in the second innings, sending down 14 wicketless overs as the match ended in a draw.\nLindwall was rested for Australia's eight-wicket win over Hampshire, before returning in the following match against Sussex. Bowling with a tailwind, he took two early wickets before returning to remove the last four batsmen to fall. Five of Lindwall's opponents were bowled as he ended with 6/34 from 19.4 overs; the hosts were dismissed for 86. During the tourists' reply, Bradman promoted Lindwall to No. 4 and he came to the wicket at 2/342, scored 57 and put on 93 runs with Neil Harvey, who scored an unbeaten 100 as Australia declared at 5/549. Lindwall then broke through with two early wickets to leave Sussex at 2/2, and went on to finish with 5/25 in 15 overs as the home side were bowled out for 138, handing Bradman's men a victory by an innings and 325 runs in two days. He ended with match figures of 11/59, with eight of his victims being bowled, five of these by swinging yorkers, unable to counter Lindwall's swerving deliveries. Fingleton said that \"Lindwall bundled the stumps over in all directions\" as Sussex \"crumpled completely ... in as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew\".\nFirst Test.\nLindwall lined up for the First Test at Trent Bridge, a venue where he had taken six wickets in the tour game against Nottinghamshire. Australia bowled first, and Lindwall delivered the first ball of the match at a moderate pace; Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings. Lindwall gradually increased his speed and rhythm, and took the wicket of Cyril Washbrook, caught on the run by Bill Brown on the fine leg boundary after the batsman had attempted a hook shot. However, he was forced to leave the field with a groin strain midway through the first day, ending with figures of 1/30. After England were out for 165, Lindwall came out to bat at 7/365 without a runner on the third day, and appeared to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty. He added 107 runs for the eighth wicket with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett. Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting before Bedser struck his off stump. Four runs later, Lindwall was caught by wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans down the leg side to leave the total at 6/469, but some free hitting by Australia's last pair allowed them to advance to 509, giving them a 344-run lead.\nAlthough Lindwall was able to jog between the wickets, he did not take the field in the second innings and the 12th man Neil Harvey replaced him. This gave Australia a marked fielding advantage—Fingleton described Harvey as \"by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides\". Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but he did not formally object to Harvey's presence on the field. Journalist, former Australian Test cricketer and Lindwall mentor Bill O'Reilly, said that as Lindwall demonstrated his mobility during his innings, he was in no way \"incapacitated\" and that the English captain \"must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far\" when no substitute was justified. O'Reilly decried the benefit Australia derived through the substitution, agreeing with Fingleton that Harvey was the tourists' best fielder by far. English commentator John Arlott went further, calling Harvey the best fielder in the world.\nHowever, the gains provided by Harvey were outweighed by Lindwall's absence, which severely hampered Australia's bowling and made their eventual victory much more difficult. England made 441 and Australia reached their target of 98 on the final afternoon to complete an eight-wicket victory. Due to his injury, Lindwall was omitted from the team for the two matches leading up to the Second Test. Australia proceeded to defeat Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing with Yorkshire.\nSecond Test.\nTwo weeks after injuring himself at Trent Bridge, Lindwall undertook a thorough fitness examination on the morning of the Second Test at Lord's. Bradman was not convinced of the bowler's fitness, but Lindwall—keen to play at the historic ground known as the \"home of cricket\"—was able to convince his captain to risk his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover. He came in late on the first afternoon with the score at 7/246 and made three runs before stumps were called at 7/258. The next morning, Lindwall batted confidently from the outset. He hit two cover drives for four from Bedser after the new ball had been taken, prompting O'Reilly to say that Lindwall was playing in the same manner as when he made his maiden Test century in the last Ashes series in 1946–47. However, he then played around a straight ball from Bedser, and was bowled for 15 to leave the score at 275/8. Australia were out for 350 shortly before lunch on the second morning. In the hosts' reply, Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after delivering the first ball of the innings to Len Hutton. Despite this, the paceman persevered through the pain.\nIn his fourth over, Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight after needlessly playing at a ball wide outside off stump. Before lunch, Lindwall bowled six overs and took 1/7, while Bill Johnston accompanied him from the other end because Keith Miller had a back injury and was only able to bat. Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman Bill Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down. After the lunch break, Hutton fell, and Compton came in, having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in the First Test while trying to avoid a bouncer. Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard. Lindwall then clean bowled Bill Edrich—who was playing across the line of the ball—for five. Tom Dollery was the new batsman and stopped the first ball with his pads before Lindwall's next delivery broke through his defences and hit the stumps to send him back to the pavilion for a duck. Dollery's bat was about to start its downward swing by the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps. O'Reilly said that Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling. This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell of 2/11 by Lindwall; the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his swing and extreme pace. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control, but the home side were given some respite when both Lindwall and Johnston were taken out of the attack. Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels.\nOnce the second new ball was taken after tea, Lindwall returned but appeared to be tired and lacking in spirit in his first over. Johnston removed Compton, and one run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. At the start of the third morning, he bowled Alec Bedser off an inside edge from a bouncer to finish with 5/70 as Australia took a 135-run first innings lead on the third morning. O'Reilly said Lindwall \"bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task ... and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler.\" Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing as to what was coming to them.\nBradman's batsmen set about building on their lead and Lindwall was initially not expected to bat; the Australian captain was expected to declare just before lunch on the fourth day so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball. Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. Lindwall came to the crease to join Miller with Australia at 5/416 on the fourth afternoon. They attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller fell and Lindwall ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary. He missed and was stumped for 25. This prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world record 596 for victory.\nFurther showers breathed extra life into the pitch at the start of the run chase, and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before he had scored and the English batsmen played and missed multiple times. Hutton had trouble seeing and playing Lindwall's deliveries in the deteriorating light with no sightscreen available, and Fingleton described it as \"probably Hutton's worst effort in a Test\". O'Reilly said Hutton \"seemed to have lost all power of concentration and looked like a man being led to the gallows\", calling him \"little more than a masquerader compared to the Hutton [of 1938]\". Hutton took 32 minutes of batting to score his first run of the innings.\nHutton and Washbrook took the score to 42—England's highest opening partnership of the series thus far—before the latter edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips and was out for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls, and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot. However, they survived Lindwall's spell of bowling. Late in the day, Lindwall was brought back to put pressure on Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance.\nLindwall returned on the final morning with the score at 6/141. Dollery, who had been batting with assurance, shaped to duck under a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Later in the same over, Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck to leave England at 8/141. The match ended when Doug Wright hit Ernie Toshack to Lindwall and was caught for four. Lindwall ended with 3/61 as Australia took a 409-run victory. Arlott said that while Toshack (5/40) had the best figures, Lindwall was the pivotal figure. He said that when Lindwall \"so patently disturbed Hutton he struck a blow at the morale of the English batting that was never overcome.\" In later years, Bradman told Lindwall he pretended not to notice the bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried Bradman had noticed his injury and would be disappointed, but the Australian captain later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax and focus on his bowling.\nAfter carrying an injury into the Second Test, Bradman rested Lindwall for the match against Surrey, which started the day after the proceedings at Lord's ended; Australia took a ten-wicket victory. Lindwall returned for the match against Gloucestershire. Australia batted first and made 7/774, its highest score of the tour and the second highest by any Australian team in England. Lindwall was not able to partake in the prolific run-getting, as the tourists declared before he had scored. He bowled a total of 21 overs, taking 0/41 as Australia enforced the follow on and won by an innings and 363 runs.\nThird Test.\nWhen the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped, sparking much acrimony and controversy in the English cricket community. The reason was said to be Hutton's difficulties against Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. Observers noticed Hutton backing away, and the English selectors believed such a sight would have a negative effect on the rest of the side as it was a poor example from a key player. The Australians were pleased and believed the England selectors had erred, because they regarded Hutton as the hosts' best batsman. England batted first and Lindwall removed Hutton's replacement as opener, George Emmett, who fended a short ball to Sid Barnes at short leg to leave England at 2/28. Emmett had been surprised by Lindwall's bouncer and took his eyes from the ball, fending with one hand on the bat, while ducking his head below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett's bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia's match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not bounce Emmett again during the match, and O’Reilly surmised that the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent's weakness against the short ball. O’Reilly concluded that Lindwall and Johnston \"had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort\".\nLindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with a short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood. During this period, both Edrich and Compton found it difficult to position themselves quickly enough to play Lindwall. The Australian paceman then hit Compton on the arm, and soon after, felled him with a bouncer that the batsman top-edged into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2/33. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no-ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that after rebounding from his head, it flew more than half-way to the boundary before landing. This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup.\nLindwall returned to take the second new ball and trapped Jack Crapp, who did not offer a shot, for 37 to leave the score at 3/87. The batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. Lindwall later had Edrich gloving a rearing ball to the wicket-keeper to leave England at 5/119. Compton returned upon the fall of the fifth wicket to revive the innings and Lindwall ended with 4/99 after having Godfrey Evans caught behind from an expansive cut shot. England ended on 363 all out on the second day; Compton made an unbeaten 145. Lindwall had beaten Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch on the second day, but the Englishman survived to add more than 20 further runs. On the third day, Lindwall came to the crease at 6/172 after Barnes—who had collapsed due to the aftereffects of being hit in the ribs from point blank range when fielding—had been forced to retire hurt. Australia faced the prospect of being forced to follow on, and Lindwall received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Lindwall made 23 as Australia struggled to 221 and avoided the follow on by eight runs; he was the last man to be dismissed.\nAt the start of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who promptly removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand. This brought Lindwall's tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no-balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no-balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again and this time the England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.\nLindwall returned for a new spell late on the third day and almost hit Washbrook in the head. Hassett again dropped Washbrook, who was on 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman to signify his need for protection from the ball, much to the amusement of the crowd. Lindwall ended with 1/37 as England declared at their stumps score of 3/174 after the entire fourth day and the final morning was washed out. The match petered into a draw with Lindwall not required as Australia safely batted out the final day. Lindwall played in Australia's only match—against Middlesex—before the Fourth Test, but was not at his best. He and Miller had been partying heavily in the days before the match, and were out and binge drinking on the night before the match; they did not return until after dawn, when they were caught severely inebriated by Bradman at breakfast time. Miller was rested for the match, but Lindwall was selected for the match. The home team won the toss and elected to bat, so Lindwall could not rest and sober up in the dressing room while the specialist batsmen were at work. He was asked to bowl a lengthy spell in warm and sunny conditions on the opening morning, and was at times lying on the ground in an attempt to recover during stoppages. Nevertheless, he ended with 1/28 from 16 overs, the opposition still unable to score heavily despite his obvious lethargy. He took a total of 3/59 from 25 overs and scored one as the tourists won by an innings, removing the home team's captain George Mann twice and Edrich once. In the second innings, Lindwall took 2/31, but effectively had a third wicket. He bowled a bouncer at opener Jack Robertson, who tried to hook, but missed, suffered a fractured jaw and was forced to retire hurt, prompting angry shouting and booing from sections of the crowd. Robertson defended Lindwall, contending that the delivery was fair and that he had executed his shot incorrectly.\nFourth Test.\nHutton returned for the Fourth Test at Headingley and played effectively. At one stage he and Washbrook took five boundaries from six Lindwall overs. An opening partnership of 168 resulted until Lindwall bowled him for 81. The English opener went onto the front foot and was clean bowled, much to the dismay of the home crowd. The stand came after Washbrook had decided to refrain from hooking Lindwall's bouncers, which had caused him problems in the earlier Tests. England did not lose their second wicket until the last over of the day, when Washbrook hit Johnston into Lindwall's hands for 143, leaving the total at 2/268. Both Fingleton and O'Reilly criticised the bowling group as a whole for what they deemed a very lethargic display; the former deemed it the worst day's performance since World War II and the latter accused all the Australian bowlers of operating \"without object\".\nDuring the innings, Lindwall appealed for lbw four times while wicket-keeper Ron Saggers—standing in for the injured Tallon—remained silent, not supporting the appeal. England ran up a large score of 496 but squandered a very strong position after losing their last 8 wickets for 73 runs; Lindwall had Compton caught down the leg side to give Saggers his first Test catch, leaving England at 6/473. Lindwall ended with 2/79 from 38 overs. Fingleton said \"this grand fast bowler held the side together splendidly and answered every call\". O’Reilly said that until England collapsed—mostly due to unforced errors despite favourable conditions—only Lindwall appeared capable of threatening the batsmen. He said the paceman \"kept slogging away, tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after the other members of the attack had lost all signs of hostility ... Bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much more than his share of the galley-slave work.\" O’Reilly decried Lindwall's workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity.\nIn reply, Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall came in at 6/329 on the third afternoon. With the fall of Sam Loxton and Saggers in quick succession, Bradman's men were at 8/355 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling; he dominated in stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. He particularly liked to use his feet to get to the ball on the half-volley to hit lofted drives. Of the 103 runs added for the last two wickets, the two tail-enders managed only 25 between them. Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before the injured Toshack survived the last 50 minutes until stumps with Johnston running for him. Australia were 9/457 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12. During Lindwall's partnership with Johnston, Yardley bowled himself for over an hour, failing to bring on a frontline bowler in his stead despite being unable to dislodge the batsmen. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get the tailenders on strike. Despite Toshack and Johnston's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike and face most of the balls. O’Reilly speculated that Yardley may have bowled himself in an attempt to contain the Australians rather than dismiss them before the close of play, so his openers would not have to bat for a short period before stumps when the visitors' attack could have made inroads. However, Yardley was neither able to contain Lindwall nor dismiss the Australians. Sunday was a rest day, and on Monday, the fourth morning, Lindwall was the last man out in the third over of the day, leaving Australia on 458, 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Lindwall edged Bedser into the slips cordon and Crapp took the catch low down in his left hand.\nEngland made a strong start in their second innings—the openers registered their second century stand for the match. When Australia took the second new ball, Lindwall—worried by the substantial and hazardous craters in the pitch he and the other bowlers had created while following through on the left-hand side of the crease—changed to bowling from around the wicket and was warned for running on the pitch. He reverted to bowling from over the wicket, although he delivered from the edge of the crease to avoid the holes. O’Reilly said the warning to Lindwall played into Australia's hands as the bowler's follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right-hander's off stump that the English bowlers target when Bradman's men had to chase the target. England reached 2/232 before Lindwall trapped Edrich to end a 103-run partnership. The paceman followed this by bowling Jack Crapp, who inside edged an attempted forcing stroke through the off side from the back foot onto his own stumps. This triggered a collapse of 4/33 from 3/260 to 7/293. Lindwall took 2/84 as the hosts declared on the final day at 8/365, leaving Australia to chase a world Test record of 404 for victory, with only 345 minutes available. Centuries to Bradman and Morris in a 301-run stand saw Australia seal the series 3–0 with a record-breaking seven-wicket win with 15 minutes in hand.\nThe paceman was rested for the match against Derbyshire immediately after the Headingley Test, which Australia won by an innings. Lindwall returned for the match against Glamorgan and took 2/36 in a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. In the next match against Warwickshire, he claimed 3/27 in the first innings, taking three consecutive middle-order wickets—including Test batsmen Tom Dollery and Abdul Hafeez Kardar—in the space of 12 balls as the hosts fell for 138. In reply, Australia stumbled to 6/161 when Lindwall joined Hassett. The pair put on 70 for the seventh wicket, the largest partnership in a low-scoring match. Lindwall ended with 45, the second highest score for the entire match, as Australia took a 116-run lead. He took the first wicket and ended with 1/32 as Bradman's men won by nine wickets. Australia proceeded to face Lancashire at Old Trafford for the second time during the season in a match that doubled as Washbrook's benefit. Lindwall made 17 in the tourists' first innings of 321 and then dismissed the home side's first three batsmen, taking 3/32 as Lancashire fell for 130. Washbrook top-scored with 38 before Lindwall had him caught in the slips by Miller. He also collected several painful bruises from Lindwall on his right hand and thumb. Bradman described his leading paceman as being in \"stupendous form ... I have not seen before or since such sustained brilliance from a pace bowler\". Australia made 3/265 declared in their second innings, leaving the hosts with a target of 457 in less than a day, with Washbrook unable to bat due to Lindwall's bruising bowling. Lindwall bowled both openers with the new ball, but Lancashire appeared to be safely batting out a draw at 5/191 with only eight minutes remaining. Lindwall returned after Bradman took the new ball, and told the slip cordon to move halfway back to the boundary. Bowling with a tailwind, Lindwall was at full pace, in one of the fastest displays Bradman had seen in his long career. He bowled Jack Ikin for 99 and Dick Pollard—who later claimed to have not seen the ball—for a golden duck. The hosts were in danger of suffering a late collapse and defeat, but William Roberts successfully defended the hat-trick ball; Lancashire lost no further wickets and were 7/191 when stumps were drawn; Lindwall ended with 4/27. He also caused Washbrook to miss the final Test with a thumb injury. The paceman was rested from the non-first-class match against Durham, which was a rain-affected draw.\nFifth Test.\nAccording to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's performance in the final Test at The Oval was one of the best they had ever seen from any player. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.\nAfter Miller had taken an early wicket, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge towards the slips cordon. However, the ball continued to rise and cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who stopped the ball and waited for the batsman to regather his bat and his composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect a run out. However, this gesture of sportsmanship cost Australia little, because when Compton was on three, Lindwall bowled another bouncer. Compton attempted a hook shot and Arthur Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch, leaving the hosts at 3/17. Fingleton described Morris's feat as \"one of the catches of the season\".\nAfter the lunch break, England struggled to 4/35, before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker. The debutant Allan Watkins then batted for 16 balls in an attempt to get off the mark with a series of failed hook shots. He missed an attempted hook shot and was hit in the shoulder by another Lindwall bouncer. Soon after, Watkins was dismissed without scoring after playing across the line and being trapped lbw by Johnston, leaving England at 6/42. Watkins also collected a bruise on his right shoulder for his troubles with Lindwall; this inhibited his bowling later in the match. Following the departure of Watkins, Lindwall removed Godfrey Evans, Alec Bedser and Young, all yorked in the space of two runs. England fell from 6/45 to 9/47, bringing Hollies in at No. 11 to accompany Hutton, who had batted through the innings. Hutton then hit the only boundary of the innings, lofting a straight drive back over Lindwall's head. The ball almost went for six, landing just short of the fence. The home team's innings ended on 52 when Hutton—who never appeared to be troubled by the bowling—leg glanced Lindwall and was caught by wicket-keeper Don Tallon one-handed, at full stretch to his left. Lindwall described the catch as one of the best he had ever seen. In his post-lunch spell, Lindwall bowled a spell of 8.1 overs during which he took 5/8; he totalled 6/20 in 16.1 overs. Bradman described the spell as \"the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket\". Fingleton, who played against the \"Bodyline\" attack in 1932–33, said \"I was watching a man almost the equal of Larwood [the \"Bodyline\" spearhead] in pace ... Truly a great bowler\". O'Reilly said that Lindwall's \"magnificent performance must go down as one of the greatest bowling efforts in Anglo-Australian Tests. He had two gruelingly long sessions in the innings and overcame each so well that he set the seal on his well-earned reputation as one of the best bowlers ever.\"\nIn Australia's reply, Lindwall came in at 6/304 and attacked immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air, and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 7/332. The visitors ended on 389 and England started their second innings late on the second day. Debutant John Dewes took strike and got off the mark when he aimed a hook shot and was credited with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall's steepling bouncer had risen over his bat and narrowly missed his head. Lindwall made the early breakthrough soon after, bowling Dewes—who offered no shot—for 10 to leave England at 1/20. Dewes often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty.\nEarly on the third day, Lindwall bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards to leave England's score at 64, before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings and took the total to 2/121 at lunch. Soon after, with his score on 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot that flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip for a \"freak slip catch\" from Johnston's bowling; leaving England at 3/125. Lindwall returned for another spell after lunch and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker in the fading light, and the umpires called off play due to poor visibility after an appeal by Yardley. The next morning, England were bowled out for 188, giving Australia an innings victory and the series 4–0. Lindwall took 3/50 to total 9/70 for the match. He ended the Tests as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets at 19.62, and scored 191 runs at 31.83.\nLater tour matches.\nSeven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Lindwall made only one in a total of 361. The paceman took two wickets with the new ball to help reduce the hosts to 5/16, before they were all out for 51; Lindwall ended with 2/16. Forced to follow on, Kent were reduced to 4/37 by three early Lindwall wickets; the victims included Tony Pawson and former Test wicket-keeper Les Ames. The hosts were further hampered by the absence of opener Leslie Todd, who had been hit on the foot by a Lindwall swinging yorker in the first innings. The blow caused so much bruising that Todd's foot could not fit inside his cricket boots. Lindwall ended with 4/25 as Kent fell for 124 to lose by an innings. In his match total of 6/41 from 15 overs, Lindwall bowled four of his victims. The Kent fixture was followed by a match against the Gentlemen of England. Lindwall was not required to bat, and after taking 1/39 in the first innings, Bradman allowed him to rest as Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. Bradman rested Lindwall for the match against Somerset, which resulted in another innings victory for the tourists. The paceman returned against the South of England—a representative team—scoring an unbeaten 17 in an unbroken 61-run stand with Sam Loxton before Australia declared at 7/522. He then took 1/45 as rain ended the match at the conclusion of the hosts' second innings.\nAustralia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After the hosts had complied, the Australian skipper fielded a full-strength team. In a rain-interrupted match, Lindwall bowled Hutton for a duck with the new ball. He returned and took five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. His last five victims were former England captain Walter Robins and Test players Freddie Brown, Evans, Bedser and Laker. Lindwall ended with 6/59; four of his wickets were bowled, while the other two were caught by Ian Johnson in the slips. He made five as Australia with 8/489 declared; time ran out in the rain-affected match with Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75.\nThe tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Lindwall was rested from the first, which Australia won by an innings. In the second fixture, Lindwall signed off in a low key manner, scoring 15 and taking a total of 0/28 from 14 overs as Australia ended their campaign with another innings triumph.\nRole.\nWhen fit, Lindwall opened the bowling with Miller in the Tests, and the pair operated in short and fiery bursts with the new ball. English cricket administrators had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs in the Tests; at the time, the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored, something which usually took longer than 55 overs. The new regulation played directly into the hands of the Australians, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs. As a result, Lindwall bowled 224 overs, while Australia's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled 306. Lindwall led the Test bowling averages, with 27 wickets at 19.62, making him the equal leading wicket-taker along with Johnston, who averaged 23.33. The duo's haul of 27 Test wickets equalled the record for an Australian fast bowler during a tour of England. The Australian pair were substantially ahead the next most successful bowler, England's Alec Bedser, who took 18 wickets at 38.22. Lindwall's role as the leading strike bowler is borne out in his economy and strike rate in both the Tests and all first-class matches. He was the least economical of the three pacemen, but took his wickets more frequently than any other frontline bowler.\nIn all first-class matches, he took 86 wickets at 15.68 and held onto 14 catches, fielding in the slips. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no rest day in between, so Bradman ensured Miller and Lindwall remained fresh for the new ball bursts in the Tests by giving them a lighter workload during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4, Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Outside the Tests, Lindwall bowled 349.3 overs, only the fifth heaviest workload among the Australians in those matches.\nThe local batsmen were unable to cope with Lindwalls high pace and swing; 43 of his wickets came after his opponent had missed the ball and been bowled. Lindwall scored 411 runs at 24.17 with two fifties in the first-class matches, including 191 at 31.83 in the Tests. Lindwall had limited batting opportunities, usually playing from No. 7 to No. 9. It was hard for Lindwall to get any higher up the order as Australia's other frontline bowlers, such as Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, and were of similar batting ability. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions due to their batting strength, Lindwall only had 20 innings in his 22 matches, and usually batted at numbers 7, 8 or 9.N- However, he was often effective when he did get an opportunity.\n\"Wisden\" recognised Lindwall by naming him as one of its five Cricketers of the Year in 1949. The publication cited the paceman's ability to seize the initiative for Australia in all but one of the Tests by taking early wickets. The fast bowler's success was attributed to a \"superb control of length and direction, his change of pace and general skill, the like of which in a slower bowler could be classed as cunning\". The ferocity of Lindwall's bouncer often prompted opponents to retreat onto the back foot before he had even released the ball. \"Wisden\" said that \"by whatever standard he is judged ... [Lindwall] must be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers\".\nNotes.\nStatistical note.\nn-[1]\nThis statement can be verified by consulting all of the scorecards for the matches, as listed here."

        "title": "Arthur Morris with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Arthur Morris was a key member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948. The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\".\nA left-handed opening batsman, Morris played in all five Tests, partnering the right-handed Sid Barnes in three Tests—Barnes was injured for the other two Tests. As one of three on-tour selectors, Morris was a member of the leadership group along with Bradman and vice-captain Lindsay Hassett.\nMorris ended the first-class tour with 1,922 runs at a batting average of 71.18 including seven centuries, recording the second highest aggregate behind Bradman. Morris' s form peaked in the Test series; he headed the runscoring aggregates and averages for all players with 696 runs at 87.00, and was the only player to compile three Test centuries. In the Second Test at Lord's, Morris struck 105 to set up Australia's first innings of 350 and eventual win. He scored 182 on a deteriorating pitch on the final day of the Fourth Test at Headingley, combining for a triple-century partnership with Bradman. Australia scored 3/404 in the second innings to win by seven wickets, setting a world record for the highest successful run-chase in Test history. In the Fifth Test at The Oval, Morris scored 196, more than half of Australia's 389 as the tourists went on to win by an innings.\nBased on his performance during the tour of England, \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" named\nMorris as one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1949. They described him as \"one of the world's best left-hand batsmen\".\nBackground.\nDuring the Australian season of 1947–48, which preceded the tour of England, Morris played in the first four Tests against the touring Indians, scoring 45 and an unbeaten 100 in the Third Test victory in Melbourne. He was omitted for the Fifth Test because the selectors wanted to trial other candidates for the 1948 tour of England. Morris ended the series with 209 runs at a batting average of 52.25, making him the third highest scorer as Australia won 4–0. During the series, he had opened with both Bill Brown, the veteran who had been a mainstay of Australian teams of the 1930s, and New South Wales teammate Sid Barnes. The Australian selectors chose Brown for the first two Tests against the Indians, but he struggled and made only 18 and 11—Australia batted once in both Tests—and was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morris—whose place was secure—was rested for the Fifth Test to give Brown another chance to show that he was worthy of selection. Barnes made 33 while Brown made 99 run out as Australia completed a 4–0 series win. In the end, all three were selected for the England tour. As specialist opening batsmen, the trio were competing for the two opening positions in Bradman's first-choice team.\nMorris—recently appointed co-captain of New South Wales—greatly impressed Australian captain Don Bradman, to the extent that Bradman made himself, Morris and vice-captain Lindsay Hassett the three on-tour selectors for the 1948 visit to England. Morris was a key part of Bradman's inner circle during the planning of the tour. Bradman had long harboured an ambition to tour England without losing a match; his team would become the first to achieve this feat, earning themselves the sobriquet, \"The Invincibles\".\nEarly tour.\nMorris marked his first-class debut on English soil in the opening match of the tour, against Worcestershire. After the hosts had batted first and made 233, Morris stroked with a fluent 138 (including 19 fours) from 275 minutes. He put on an opening stand of 79 with Sid Barnes, before adding 186 for the second wicket with Bradman. Australia declared at 8/462 before completing an innings victory. Morris and Bradman's scoring matched one another during their partnership and both were close to being the first Australian century-maker on the tour. The former was on 95 and took three runs to move to 98, before Bradman hit consecutive fours to progress from 91 to 99. The Australian captain failed to score for the rest of the over, so Morris took the strike in the next over and reached his century before Bradman followed suit. After reaching triple figures, Morris added his last 38 runs in 50 minutes. Morris's role indicated his standing alongside Barnes as a first-choice opener, as Australia customarily selected its strongest team for the tour opener. The third opener taken on tour, Bill Brown, played out of position in the middle order.\nMorris was rested from the second tour match, which was against Leicestershire; Bradman's team won by an innings. He returned against Yorkshire, and in a low-scoring match on a damp pitch favouring slower bowling, made 17 and three as Australia won by only four wickets. The match saw 324 runs scored for the loss of 35 wickets and a top-score of only 34. Morris's 17 in the first innings was actually the fourth highest score for the entire match. The match was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour; the tourists were 6/31 in pursuit of the target of 60, with effectively only three wickets in hand because Sam Loxton was injured and unable to bat. The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval. In the first hour of play, Australia's openers played solidly and rarely missed a ball. Morris scored 65 as he and Barnes put on an opening stand of 136, which laid the foundation for Australia's 632. The tourists went on to win the match by an innings. In the next fixture, Morris managed only 26 as Australia piled on 4/414 declared against Cambridge University. Morris bowled for the first time on tour, sending down five wicketless overs for 11 runs as Australia completed their second innings victory in succession.\nMorris was rested as Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the summer. During the match, the Australian batsmen set a world record by scoring 721 runs on the first day, a new world record for the most runs in one day of first-class cricket. Morris returned for the innings victory against Oxford University, putting on an opening stand of 138 with Brown before being run out for 64. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton reported that Hubert Webb \"brilliantly ran out Morris from the boundary with a throw over the stumps\". Australia amassed 431 and won completed their fourth consecutive innings victory. In the hosts' second innings, Morris took his first wicket of the tour, bowling Indian Test batsman Abdul Hafeez Kardar to end with 1/6 from three overs.\nThe next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their strongest possible team. Morris and Barnes retained their positions at the top of the order, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. It was a chance to players from both sides to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests, but Morris looked uncomfortable, managing only five as Australia amassed 552 and enforced the follow on to win by an innings. In the MCC's second innings, Morris caught Jim Laker from the bowling of Colin McCool. The Lord's fixture was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. Morris continued to struggle, making five and 22, falling twice to England Test paceman Dick Pollard, In the drawn match against Nottinghamshire, Morris continued his form slump, making 16 in the tourists' only innings.\nMorris found batting difficult for the first few weeks of the tour, as he struggled to adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.\nAfter being rested for the eight-wicket win over Hampshire, Morris rectified his technical problem, and success followed against Sussex. After the hosts had been rolled for 86 in their first innings, Morris dominated an opening partnership of 153 with Brown, who made only 44 before becoming the first man to fall. Morris added a further 189 for the second wicket with Bradman before he fell for 184 at 2/342. He had struck 26 fours, laying the platform for Australia's total of 5/549 declared and eventual innings victory. He was to hit five more first-class centuries before the end of the season.\nFirst Test.\nMorris thus headed into the First Test at Trent Bridge with a century under his belt. He held his position at the top of the order along with Barnes, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. Morris bowled three overs for four runs in the first innings as England were bowled out for 165 on the first day after winning the toss and electing to bat. During the innings, Morris took a reflex catch when Godfrey Evans hit a ball strongly, directly to him at short leg to leave England at 7/74.\nAustralia survived the last 15 minutes on the first evening to reach stumps on 0/17, with Morris on 10. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled by Jim Laker's off spin for 31. Barnes batted confidently, while the hesitant Morris shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes, During this period, Morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from seamer Alec Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, who dropped the catch. He recomposed himself and hit left arm orthodox spinner Jack Young's first ball—a full toss—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss. Morris fell when he tried to force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad; the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Australia went on to amass 509, and when England batted again, they lost their third wicket at 150. Joe Hardstaff junior came in, and on the third ball he aimed a cut that went low to second slip, just as he did in the first innings. However, Morris dropped the catch. Hardstaff exploited his second chance to make 43 before falling at 4/243.\nAustralia eventually bowled England out for 441, leaving them a target of 98 on the final day. Bradman's openers progressed quickly at the start of the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, but Morris again lacked fluency. Australia reached 38 from 32 minutes when Bedser bowled Morris for nine, but the tourists steadied to reach their target with eight wickets in hand. After bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger. Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch. Following the match, Fingleton criticised Morris, feeling that he was shuffling across the crease too much instead of playing from the back foot.\nIn the match immediately after the First Test, Morris scored 60 against Northamptonshire, putting on 122 runs with Lindsay Hassett as Australian completed an innings win. He was then rested ahead of the Second Test as Australia drew with Yorkshire at Bramall Lane in Sheffield.\nSecond Test.\nIn the Second Test at Lord's, Australia elected to bat first and England made an ideal start. The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling and removed Barnes for a duck in his second over to leave the tourists at 1/3. England restricted the Australians in the first hour and created several near misses, particularly against Bradman, who nervous early on. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scored many runs from the back cut. At the end of the pace bowlers' opening spells, the leg spin of Doug Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no-ball that Morris dispatched over the leg side fence for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated steadily, although the latter was able to extract substantial spin, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman on 35.\nShortly afterwards, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time in Tests in Bedser's leg trap. Len Hutton—who took the catch—had dropped Bradman in the same position when the Australian captain was on 13. At the other end, Morris began to take control. He drove the ball through the covers and clipped it off his pads through the leg side. Morris reached his century with consecutive boundaries from Coxon. Fingleton called the innings \"a pretty Test century in the grandest of all cricket settings\". This ended a run of poor form for Morris, a period during which he had shuffled uncertainly on the crease without moving forward or back decisively. O'Reilly called it Morris's best Test century to date, as this was the strongest English attack he had faced during his career, and because of the loss of wickets at the other end. O'Reilly said Morris had been disciplined in not playing loose shots outside off stump and missing or edging them, yet still being able to score quickly at every opportunity. Morris was out soon after for 105 from 166 balls, after hitting Coxon to Hutton in the gully to leave Australia at 3/166. His innings included 14 fours and one six, and was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives. With Morris gone, Australia fell to 7/258 at stumps, before the lower order counterattacked on the second morning and took the total to 350. Bradman's team took a 135-run lead after dismissing England for 215.\nThe weather was fine as Australia started their second innings on the third morning. The Australian openers took a cautious approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit the stumps, looking for a solid start. Both openers were given early reprieves. Barnes survived a stumping opportunity when he was 18. Laker came on and induced Morris into hitting an airborne ball back down the pitch, but he was slow to react to the possibility of a caught and bowled. According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers would have been able to reach the ball and attempt a catch. The openers took advantage to combine for an opening stand of 122. Wright came on and again bowled a no-ball at the start of his spell, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. After shuffling around with uncertainty at the start of his innings, Morris began to play more fluently. He was eventually bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps. The opening partnership laid the platform for Australia's 7/460 declared, which allowed them to set an imposing target of 596 and win by 409 runs to take a 2–0 series lead.\nMorris was rested by Bradman for the second match against Surrey, which started the day after the Test and ended in a ten-wicket victory for the Australians. The following match was against Gloucestershire at Bristol, and in only five hours on the first day, Morris scored his career best of 290. Having lost the first two Tests, England were contemplating changes to their team: Tom Goddard was earmarked to replace Jim Laker as the off spinner after performing strongly in county cricket, while Laker had struggled in the Second Test. The English hoped Goddard would be the strike bowler to cut through Australia's strong batting line-up. Morris's assault ended Goddard's hopes of Test selection. His innings was highlighted by his quick assessment of the length of the ball, followed by decisive footwork. Morris confidently advanced out of the crease when the ball was of a full length to drive and rocked onto the back foot to and cut if Goddard dropped short. Unable to contain Morris, Goddard packed the leg side field and bowled outside leg stump. Morris responded by stepping down the wicket towards the leg side, charging the bowler and repeatedly lofting the ball inside out over the off side. He reached his century before lunch and his 200 by the tea interval. By the time Morris was dismissed, he had struck 40 fours and a six. He put on stands of 102 with Barnes, 136 with Keith Miller and 162 with Neil Harvey before falling with the score at 4/466. Fingleton said \"Morris flayed it [the home team's bowling] in all directions\", while former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said \"Tom [Goddard] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking] to him and that gets him many wickets.\" Australia amassed 5/560 on the first day before declaring at 7/774, their largest score of the tour and the second highest by any Australian team on English soil. Morris took a match total of 1/35 as Australia won by an innings.\nThird Test.\nFollowing his effort in Bristol, Morris proceeded to the Third Test at Old Trafford. England batted first and made 363. During the innings, Barnes was hit in the kidneys by a Dick Pollard pull shot while fielding at short leg. When Australia started their first innings reply, Barnes was still recuperating after being carried from the field and taken to hospital for a medical examination.\nHaving dropped Brown for the Test, Barnes's injury left Australia with only Morris as a specialist opener. Off spinner Ian Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He was unable to make an impact, as Bedser removed him for one, before Pollard trapped Bradman leg before wicket (lbw) to leave Australia at 2/13. The tourists were pinned down as Pollard bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run, aiming at leg stump. Pollard was reinforced by Bedser, who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter fell. Miller joined Morris and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps, with the latter—who had been the more sedate in the partnership—on 48.\nAustralia struggled against the new ball in the first hour of the day three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before being trapped lbw for 31; the tourists added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Morris reached 51 and fell to Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139. It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradman's team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.\nPlay finally began after the tea, and the pitch played very slowly because of the excess moisture. As Australia had no intention of chasing the runs, England captain Norman Yardley often installed seven men in close catching positions. In the first half-hour, the tourists showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Johnson then fell for six to leave Australia at 1/10. Bradman came to the crease and played 11 balls without scoring while Morris scored two streaky fours from Bedser. Yardley used his spinners for an hour, while Morris and Bradman made little effort to score. For 105 minutes, Morris stayed at one end and Bradman at the other; neither looked to rotate the strike by taking singles. The Australian skipper faced only eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled when his partner wanted a single that he sent him back. Thereafter, the tourists batted steadily and defensively to ensure a draw. They ended at 1/92 from 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, with 35 maidens; this was the slowest innings run rate for the series to date. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century during the Test series. The match finally ended after a series of periodic rain interruptions.\nMorris struck 109 against Middlesex in the following tour match at Lord's. The hosts batted first and made 203, and Australia stumbled to 3/53 before Morris combined with Sam Loxton (123) for a 172-run fourth-wicket stand. Australia recovered to reach 317 and went on to a ten-wicket win. Morris's century meant he had amassed 504 runs in just over a week of cricket.\nFourth Test.\nThe Fourth Test at Headingley in Leeds saw Morris at his finest; England elected to bat and started strongly with 496 in the first innings, their highest score of the series. On a placid pitch, Morris was one of seven bowlers used as Bradman sought a breakthrough; each of the first three wickets put on century partnerships. Bill Edrich hit a long hop from Morris's left arm unorthodox spin to the boundary to reach his century, before Bedser lifted him high over square leg for six. This prompted Bradman to replace Morris after he conceded 20 runs in five overs as England reached 2/423. Edrich was out when he attempted to pull Johnson to the on side in the large gap between mid-on and square leg, but only hit it in the air to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on to leave the score at 4/426, before England collapsed to 496.\nEngland took a 38-run lead after Australia replied with 458. Morris contributed only six while batting with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, who had been promoted from the middle order to open while Barnes was still injured; Bradman had overlooked reserve opener Brown. Morris chipped Bedser in the air to Ken Cranston at mid-wicket to leave Australia at 1/13. Australia slumped to 3/68 before a middle-order fightback took Australia to 458 early on the fourth morning. England declared at 8/365 early on the fifth morning, leaving Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin and bounce unevenly.\nAt the time, 404 would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach their target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce. It appeared they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point. In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings, Morris chipped the ball in the air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, but this time the ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes, Australia had only made 0/10.\nAfter Bedser had bowled three overs, Laker replaced him in the seventh over as Yardely attempted to exploit the turning surface, but 13 runs were taken from his first over. Hassett hit a four and took a single to rotate the strike. Later in the over, Morris hit a four, was beaten by a bouncing ball that hurried off the pitch, before striking another boundary. Despite the expensive Laker over, only 44 runs came in the first hour, meaning that the tourists still needed 360 runs from 285 minutes. The crowd heckled the Australian openers for their slow scoring and they applauded ironically after Morris took a single. After his poor first over, Laker had settled down and conceded only two runs from his next six overs, and \"was getting at least one ball every over to turn considerably\".\nIn an attempt to exploit the worn surface, Yardley brought on the part-time left-arm unorthodox spin of Compton to partner Laker. The occasional bowler was inaccurate and Morris struck two fours in his first over to bring up Australia's 50 in 64 minutes. However, Compton's deceived Morris—who danced down the pitch and missed the ball—in the next over, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity with the batsman on 32 and Australia at 0/55. Laker beat Morris in the following over with an off break that spun a foot, before Compton removed Hassett for 17 with the score at 57.\nBradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 271 minutes. The Australian captain signalled his intentions by reaching 12 in only six minutes. Yardley then called upon the occasional leg spin of Hutton in an attempt to exploit the turning wicket. However, Hutton did not bowl regularly so he had trouble in maintaining his consistency. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours to reach 51 during Hutton's first over, which Fingleton described as \"rather terrible\" due to the errant length. Bradman took two fours off Hutton's next over before almost hitting a catch. However, the 20 runs from Hutton's two inaccurate overs had allowed Australia to reach 1/96 from 90 minutes.\nIn the next over, Compton greatly troubled Bradman, who edged two balls and was dropped once. At the other end, Morris continued to take advantage of Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with the opener on 63 and his captain on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.\nUpon resumption, Compton continued as Yardley persisted with his policy of trying to exploit the deteriorating pitch with as much spin as possible. Compton was not a regular bowler and sent down a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs. Morris struck seven fours in two overs of what Fingleton called \"indescribably bad bowling\". This sequence included six fours in eight balls. As Morris continued to attack, Compton began to crack under the pressure and his accuracy worsened. Compton had generated trouble for the batsmen by tossing the ball up and beating the bat or inducing edges, but Morris counterattacked with drives. Compton tried to hold back his length to avoid being driven, but the Australian opener pounced on the shorter balls. Morris reached the 90s just 14 minutes after the interval and hit another boundary to reach his century in just over two hours. Morris had added 37 runs since lunch, while Bradman had furthered his total by only three.\nThe Australian onslaught against the spinners prompted Yardley to take the new ball and replace Compton with his fast men. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and Yardley dropped him soon after. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes remaining, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker to the fence. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken during a delay for treatment, and Morris had to shield Bradman from the strike until the skipper's pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea, with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century as the second-wicket stand passed 200.\nMorris was given another life on 136, when Laker dropped him at square leg from the bowling of Compton. Bradman was given another life at 108; he advanced two metres down the pitch towards Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, after hitting a tired-looking shot to mid-off, having partnered Bradman for a stand of 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. Australia still needed 46 for victory, and went on to win by seven wickets with 15 minutes to spare, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase.\nMorris was rested for the match against Derbyshire immediately after the Headingley Test, which Australia won by an innings, as well as the next match against Glamorgan, which was a rain-affected draw. He returned to score 32 and 20 not out as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Australia faced Lancashire for the second time on the tour; Morris made 49 and 16 as the match ended in a draw. Morris and Barnes put on 123 in the first innings, but their teammates were unable to build on the platform and Australia ended on 321. Morris was rested from the non-first-class match against Durham, which was a rain-affected draw.\nFifth Test.\nAustralia proceeded to The Oval for the Fifth Test. England won the toss and elected to bat on a pitch affected by heavy rain prior to the match. With the score at 2/17, Lindwall bowled a bouncer, which Compton hooked. Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch, described by Fingleton as \"one of the catches of the season\". England collapsed to be all out for 52 as Australia's pacemen extracted bounce and movement from the pitch.\nIn contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the overcast skies cleared and sun came out. The debutant Allan Watkins opened the bowling, delivering four overs for 19 runs before the after-effects of a Lindwall blow to the shoulder became too much. The openers passed England's first innings total with ease in less than an hour, and Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The tourists reached 117 before Barnes fell to Eric Hollies for 61, ending an opening stand that had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As the Australian captain had already announced his retirement after the end of the series, the innings would be his last in Test cricket if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to the wicket. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving Bradman three cheers, before shaking his hand. The Australian captain needed only four runs for a Test average of 100, but was bowled by Hollies for a second ball duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Bradman received another large round of applause as he left the arena.\nHassett came in at 2/117 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hooked Hollies for two fours just before stumps. On the second morning, Morris registered his third century of the Test series and his sixth in Ashes matches. The innings had taken 208 minutes and included four fours. Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped the former for 37. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply on the first day and were already well in the lead, they had plenty of time to complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease. Miller made five, before Harvey came to the crease and hit two quick boundaries before being dismissed. Hollies took both wickets.\nLoxton came in and accompanied Morris for 39 further runs before falling to Edrich. Lindwall fell for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run after the ball was hit to third man. Morris was called through for a run by Don Tallon, but he was too slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Australia went on to finish with 389. Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. Hollies tossed the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into attacking balls that spun after pitching on off stump. Morris took four catches for the match as Australia took victory by an innings and 149 runs, sealing a 4–0 Test series triumph.\nLater tour matches.\nSeven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Morris made 43 in a total of 361 before Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. Morris was rested for the following three matches against the Gentlemen of England, Somerset and the South of England. The first two matches were won by innings while the third was washed out after Australia took a large first-innings lead. In the meantime, Morris underwent minor surgery for a split in his hand.\nAustralia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI, named after H. D. G. Leveson-Gower. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current Test players be allowed to play for the hosts. After his demands were met, Bradman named a full-strength team. After the tourists dismissed the home team for 177, Morris made 62 in a 102-run opening stand with Barnes before Yardley bowled him. Australia declared at 8/489 and time ran out with Leveson-Gower's XI at 2/75 after multiple rain delays.\nThe tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, Morris was the mainstay of the innings, scoring 112 as Australia batted first and made 236. The Scots replied with 85 and were forced to follow on. Morris led the wicket-taking in the second innings, taking 5/10 from five overs as the hosts fell for 111 to hand the Australians an innings victory. He continued his success in the second match, taking three of Scotland's first four batsmen to end with 3/17 as the hosts fell for 178. Batting at No. 7, Morris made 10 as Australia declared at 6/407 and bowled four overs for eight runs without taking a wicket as Bradman's men ended the tour with another innings victory.\nRole.\nA left-handed opening batsman, Morris played in all five Tests, partnering the right-handed Sid Barnes in three Tests; Barnes was injured in the Third and Fourth Tests. Barnes was unable to open in the former and did not play in the latter. Three opening batsmen were taken on the tour, with Bill Brown being the reserve. During the tour matches, which were usually played consecutively with only one or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio, so one would generally be rested while the other two opened. Notable exceptions occurred in the Test series and the opening match against Worcestershire and the clash against the MCC. In those matches, Australia fielded its first-choice team; Brown played out of position in the middle order, while Morris and Barnes opened. A very occasional left-arm unorthodox spin bowler, Morris delivered only 35 overs during the first-class matches, including eight in the Tests. He took two wickets, both outside the Test arena.\nMorris ended the first-class matches with 1,922 runs at 71.18 including seven centuries, ranking him second in runs only to Bradman (2,428 at 89.92) and substantially ahead of third-placed Hassett (1,563 at 74.42). He did so despite being troubled by a split between the first and second fingers of his left hand, caused by constant jarring from the bat as he played the ball. The wound often opened while he was batting, forcing him to undergo a minor operation which sidelined him from some matches in the latter part of the tour.\nIn recognition of his performances, Morris was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949. \"Wisden\" described him as \"one of the world's best left-hand batsmen\". Neville Cardus—his former critic—praised Morris's performance during \"The Invincibles\" tour as \"masterful, stylish, imperturbable, sure in defence, quick and handsome in stroke play. His batting is true to himself, charming and good mannered but reliant and thoughtful.\"\nMorris's form peaked in The Ashes, heading the Test averages and aggregates with 696 runs at 87.00. Bradman (502 at 72.57) and Denis Compton (562 at 62.44) were the next closest; nobody else scored more than 360 runs. He was the only player to compile three Test centuries, and added three further fifties.\nNotes.\nStatistical note.\nn-[1]\nThis statement can be verified by consulting all of the scorecards for the matches, as listed here."

        "title": "Paul Kruger (American football)",
        "text": "Paul Christian Kruger Jr. (born February 15, 1986) is a former American football defensive end. He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the second round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at Utah. He also played for the Cleveland Browns and New Orleans Saints.\nEarly years.\nKruger was an All-conference and preseason All-America quarterback as a senior in 2003 at Timpanogos High School in Orem, Utah. He was the team captain and lettered all four years. Kruger was ranked in the top 30 quarterbacks nationally by Student Sports.\nFrom 2005 to 2007, he served a two-year mission for the LDS church in the Kansas City area (The Missouri Independence Mission).\nCollege career.\nAfter an all-conference sophomore season in 2008, he decided to forgo his final two years of college eligibility to enter the 2009 NFL Draft. He was a member of two undefeated teams: signed with the University of Utah Utes as a quarterback in 2004 and was a redshirt on the 12–0, Fiesta Bowl champion team. He started at right end for Utah's 2008 13–0, Sugar Bowl champion team.\nCareer statistics.\nSource:\nKruger redshirted his freshman year of 2004, after which he served a two-year mission in Kansas and Missouri for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, returning to the football field in the fall of 2007.\nIn 2007, he was a \"Sporting News\" and Scout.com second-team Freshman All-American. He was also honorable mention All-Mountain West. Kruger played in all 13 games and started the last 11 at right end. His 63 tackles were the most among the league's freshman linemen and the second-best freshman total at any position and ranked fourth on the team. He also had 7.5 tackles for loss, three sacks, five pass breakups, three fumble recoveries, a forced fumble and an interception. Kruger helped lead a Utes’ defense that ranked 11th in the nation against the run (99.2 ypg) and 11th-overall in total defense (289.2 ypg).\nDue to an off-field injury (see Personal section), he was held out of spring practices but returned to the field in the fall.\nAs a sophomore in 2008, he was a first-team All-Mountain West defensive lineman. \"Sports Illustrated\" and \"College Football News\" named him honorable mention All-American. He played and started in all 13 games at right end. He led Utah and ranked second in the conference in tackles for loss (16.5) and was third in the league in sacks (7.5). He had seven pass breakups, which ranked second on the team, as well as two forced fumbles. His 61 total tackles ranked fifth on the team. He had four sacks (all solo) against Utah State that tied the school record and was the best single-game total in the country. His five TFL in that same game was the second-best mark in school history. He intercepted a pass against BYU and returned it 30 yards.\nProfessional career.\nKruger was considered a top defensive end prospect for the 2009 NFL Draft.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nOn April 25, 2009, Kruger was selected in the second round (57th overall pick) of the 2009 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Ravens.\nOn November 29, 2009, in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kruger intercepted a Dennis Dixon pass in overtime and returned it 22 yards to set the Ravens up for a game-winning 29-yard field goal by kicker Billy Cundiff.\nDuring the 2010 offseason Kruger was looking to bulk up in order to make the move from linebacker to defensive end in Baltimore's 3–4 defense mostly because of the lack of playing time he saw at OLB.\n2010 was a frustrating year for Kruger playing in a new position as a 3–4 DE, he only recorded one tackle, and one sack in very limited playing time, playing in just 11 games and no starts. He deflected two passes.\nAfter a 2010 season in which he struggled to get playing time at defensive end, he was moved back to outside linebacker in the Ravens hybrid 3–4 defensive scheme in 2011. He saw much more action in 2011 playing as a situational pass rusher, coming in and replacing Ravens veteran linebacker Jarret Johnson for 3rd down passing situations. He managed to rack up 5.5 regular season sacks in his new role, along with 15 tackles. In addition to this, he also recorded a sack against New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in the AFC championship game. The Ravens would go on to lose this game 23–20.\nDuring the 2012 season, Kruger would become a significant part of the Ravens defense. In Week 10, against the Oakland Raiders, Kruger deflected a pass and picked an interception in a 55–20 win. During Week 16 against the New York Giants, he sacked quarterback Eli Manning in a 33–14 victory. During the Wild card round in the 2012 playoffs, he forced Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck to fumble. The Ravens would win 24–9. In the divisional round against the Denver Broncos, he recovered a strip sack fumble by Terrell Suggs on quarterback Peyton Manning in which the Ravens would go on to win 38–35 in double overtime. In Super Bowl XLVII, he had two sacks on critical junctures of the game, forcing the 49ers to kick field goals. The Ravens went on to win this game 34–31, giving Kruger his first Super Bowl victory.\nCleveland Browns.\nKruger signed with the Cleveland Browns to a five-year $40M contract on March 12, 2013. He was one of the starting outside linebackers on opening day and has started all 16 games in 2013 for the team, providing a much needed pass rush from the Browns team of the previous year with 4.5 recorded sacks. He finished the 2013 season with 47 total tackles and 4.5 sacks.\nKruger had his best career season in 2014 recording 11 sacks, 36 solo tackles and 17 assists. He had 4 forced fumbles with one fumble recovery and played in all 16 games, starting 15 of them. \nIn 2015, Kruger recorded 2.5 sacks, 16 solo tackles, and 11 assists in 16 games and 15 starts. \nKruger was released by the Browns on August 29, 2016, during the final week of the preseason.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn August 31, 2016, Kruger was signed by the New Orleans Saints.\nPersonal life.\nKruger went through two serious childhood accidents. He lost a kidney and his spleen and almost died in his uncle's jeep accident at age 13. In college at Salt Lake City, Utah (January 29, 2008), a street stabbing left him with a collapsed lung and a 6.5-inch scar on his chest. A screwdriver was driven through the back of a Ute teammate and brass knuckles were used to break the nose and shatter the cheekbone of his younger brother. The fight left Kruger with \"life-threatening injuries\" that required nearly 50 staples to close the incisions made during a four-hour surgery. Kruger married Cleveland native Jacqueline Hoyle on July 18, 2015."

        "title": "John Barrett (tennis)",
        "text": "John Edward Barrett, (born 17 April 1931) is a former tennis player, television commentator and author. He was born in Mill Hill, North West London, the son of Alfred Edward Barrett, a leaf tobacco merchant, and Margaret Helen Barrett (née Walker). He had one sister, Irene Margaret Leppington (1925–2009), a research chemist. His father had the rare distinction of having played both for Leicester Tigers RFC as a wing three-quarter and for Leicester Fosse FC (the former Leicester City) as a wing half.\nBiography.\nEducated at University College School in Hampstead, he was a prominent British junior tennis player and won the National Schoolboy title in 1948. He also played three years of junior country rugby for Middlesex, captaining an unbeaten team in his last year. He was twice the Royal Air Force tennis champion during his period of National Service which he completed before going up to St. John's College, Cambridge (1951–1954), where he gained an honours degree in history. He represented Cambridge in three winning years against Oxford, captaining the team in his last year, and twice represented Oxford and Cambridge in the biennial match against Harvard and Yale for the Prentice Cup, winning in 1952 and losing in 1954.\nHe went on to compete at Wimbledon for eighteen years from 1951, reaching the third round of the singles on four occasions and the quarter-finals of the mixed doubles three times. At his peak he was ranked as his country's fifth best singles player. His five career singles tiles wins from ten finals were at the North of England Hard Court Championships at Scarborough on clay in April 1953, the same month he won the Roehampton Hardcourt tournament at Roehampton also on clay. In September 1953 he won the Welsh Covered Court Championships at Llandudno on indoor wood courts. In April 1956 he won the Hurlingham Hardcourt tournament on clay. His last title was at the Northern Championships in Manchester on grass in May 1966.\nHis doubles successes included the capture of the 1953 National Covered Court title with Don Black of Rhodesia and the 1956 Asian Doubles with Roger Becker. In 1956 he became a Davis Cup player and was appointed captain of the British Davis Cup team for the years 1959–1962. Three years later he established and ran the LTA Training Squad, known as \"The Barrett Boys\" which set new standards of fitness in British tennis between 1965 and 1968.\nIn 1955 he had joined Slazengers Ltd., the sports equipment firm, as a trainee executive and remained with them for 39 years rising to become the International Promotions Director for tennis and a member of the board of directors until his retirement in 1994. During his time with the company he became the tennis correspondent of the \"Financial Times\" in 1963, a post he filled as a freelance contributor until 2006. In 1986 he joined the team that compiles the daily crossword for the pink paper and still compiles a themed crossword for each year's Wimbledon.\nTo mark the start of open tennis in 1968 he launched the BP International Tennis Fellowship in association with the oil company. This was a junior development programme open to all young boys and girls who had won an age-group singles title at any junior tournament on the LTA's official list of events. The following year he published \"The BP Yearbook of World Tennis\" to record the events of that momentous first year of open competition. In 1971 the title was changed to \"World of Tennis\" and he edited and contributed to it for the next 32 years. From 1981 to 2001, when the last issue was published, this bible of the game was also the official yearbook of the International Tennis Federation (ITF).\nHis other writing includes \"Tennis and Racket Games\" (Macdonald 1975), \"Play Tennis With Rosewall\", a coaching manual produced in collaboration with the great Australian champion, and he co-authored \"From Where I Sit\", the autobiography of Dan Maskell, his predecessor as Wimbledon's Voice of Tennis for BBC Television. His monument to the game \"100 Wimbledons – a Celebration\" was first published in 1986 and re-published in 2001 as \"Wimbledon – the Official History of The Championships\". A third revised and expanded edition, \"Wimbledon the Official History\", brought the story up to date when it was published in May 2013. In June 2014 an updated fourth edition appeared to include the historic events of 2013 when Andy Murray became the first British men's champion for 77 years.\nBarrett's broadcasting career with BBC Television began in 1971. Barrett began commentating on Wimbledon men's singles finals for BBC Television at the end of the 1970s. Barrett's voice was heard on the BBC broadcast of the epic fourth set tiebreak between Borg and McEnroe in the 1980 final (this has often been shown again on TV). Barrett commentated on Wimbledon men's singles finals until 1998. David Mercer took over from Barrett for the 1999 and 2000 men's singles finals, but Barrett commentated on the 2001 and 2002 finals. From 2003, Andrew Castle commentated on Wimbledon men's singles finals instead of Barrett. Barrett announced his retirement from the BBC commentary box at Wimbledon in 2006.\nBarrett also commentated for Channel 9, Australia (1980–1986) and for Channel Seven, Australia (1987–2007) and at various times for BSB and Sky in the UK; HBO, ESPN and the USA Networks in America; CTV in Canada and ATV and TVB in Hong Kong. In 2007 he was awarded the MBE for Services to Sports Broadcasting. For fourteen years (1997–2011) he served as President of The Dan Maskell Trust, a charitable organisation established in 1997 to help people with disabilities to play tennis.\nA member of the International Lawn Tennis Club of Great Britain since 1953, he served as chairman from 1983 to 1994, as president from 2004 to 2008 and is currently a vice-president.\nA member of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club since 1955 and currently a vice-president, he served for twelve years on the Club Committee and the Committee of Management of The Championships, during which time he started to compile a complete database of every result that has ever occurred at Wimbledon, in all events. This mammoth task took some 20 years to complete and can now be accessed on the club's web site.\nIn April 1967 he married the former French, Australian and Wimbledon champion Angela Mortimer and they have a son, a daughter and four grandchildren. In 2014 Barrett was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Cycling in Toronto",
        "text": "Toronto, Ontario, like many North American cities, has slowly been expanding its purpose-built cycling infrastructure. The number of cyclists in Toronto has been increasing progressively, particularly in the city's downtown core. As cycling conditions improve, a cycling culture has grown and alternatives such as automobiles are seen as less attractive. The politics of providing resources for cyclists, particularly dedicated bike lanes, has been contentious, particularly since the 2010s.\nHistory.\nToronto was no exception when the penny-farthing, and later the safety bicycle, arrived in North American cities in the late 19th century. This predated the advent of the automobile. The roads at the time were not ideal for bicycle travel. With the advent of the automobile the romance of the bicycle faded. It wasn't until the 10-speed bike boom of the 1970s that use of the bicycle for transportation in Toronto regained some traction, including the creation of the Beltline Trail.\nIn 1975, the Toronto City Cycling Committee was established by the former City to promote cycling and safety initiatives. It was composed of cycling advocates, City Councillors and volunteers. In forming the committee, Council adopted the following policy statement: \"Council recognizes that the bicycle, as an integral and efficient form of transportation and as a means of recreation, can make a significant contribution to the quality of City life; therefore, it is the policy of Council to implement programs that will promote and facilitate greater and safer use of the bicycle.\"\nIn 2001, Toronto City Council adopted the Toronto Bike Plan with the aim of doubling the number of cycling trips and reducing crashes and injuries by 2011.\nOn May 25, 2009, Toronto City Council voted 28–16 to remove the reversible centre commuter traffic lane on Jarvis Street and improve the streetscape by widening sidewalks, planting trees, installing heritage plaques, and implementing bicycle lanes. In 2011, after the election of new mayor Rob Ford, a new Council voted to remove the bicycle lanes and reinstate the previous configuration. The Council opted for a new bicycle route along the parallel Sherbourne Street. On November 17, 2012, following removal of the bicycle lanes, the reversible centre lane reopened.\nStarting in 2011, under Mayor Rob Ford, Bike Share Toronto began operating a bicycle-sharing system, with over 6000 bikes and 600 stations across the city. Since 2015, several major streets such as Bloor Street have gained segregated bike lanes, with lanes planned along Eglinton Avenue following the completion of Line 5 Eglinton construction work in the early 2020s.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, 40 km of bike lanes were installed across the city along major corridors as part of physical distancing measures in a project called ActiveTO. As with previous trial projects such as on Bloor Street in 2016, ActiveTO installations involved temporary barriers and minimal changes to street layout. These bike lanes were made permanent in Dec 2021, after results showed high ridership, increased safety and minimal travel time delays for drivers.\nInfrastructure and support.\nFollowing the 2001 Toronto Bike Plan, Toronto City Council has approved several updated plans including the 2016 10 Year Cycling Network Plan, and the 2021 Cycling Network Plan Update. This sets out a plan to create a citywide cycling network of on-road, off-road bikeways, signage and parking. The other major prong of the bike plan is education and promotion to reduce the number of collisions/falls and to increase the number of people who bike.\nThe Bike Plan is a major program to dramatically expand the network through on-road bike lanes, signed routes and off-road multi-use paths. The goal was that by 2011 any cyclist in the city proper should be within a five-minute ride of a designated bike route. The network is planned for 1000 km of bikeways including 500 km of on-street bike lanes, and another 250 km of off-road paved trails. , around 750 kilometres of the 1000 km proposed bikeway network is in place, with 367 km of this on street.\nTwo major off-road paved trails along the Don and Humber river valleys provide a backbone for transport on the east and west side of the downtown area. The two trails are connected by the Martin Goodman Trail along the lakeshore as part of the larger Waterfront Trail that goes along Lake Ontario. All of these off-road trails are heavily used by cyclists but still have some issues with continuity and trail quality that keep them from being prime cycling transportation corridors.\nThe city has installed thousands of \"post and ring stands\" for on-street bike parking in the last few years.\nLegality.\nCycling as transportation is covered under the Ontario \"Highway Traffic Act\". In the event of a crash, collision or non-HTA related charges the Advocacy for Respect for Cyclists also offers a Legal Info page.\nEducation.\nThe City of Toronto offers CAN-BIKE cycling skills courses. CAN-BIKE's philosophy is to train cyclists of all levels how to ride safely as a vehicle in regular traffic, also known as vehicular cycling by proponents of John Forester.\nA number of different organizations offer bike mechanic workshops, such as the Toronto District School Board, Community Bicycle Network, Bike Pirates, BikeSauce and Bikechain. Except the Toronto District School Board, all of these organisations also have public access tool use and bicycle repair and recycling, with different pay scales for shop use (depending on the organisation).\nPublic bike sharing.\nToronto's bike share system - Bike Share Toronto - launched on May 3, 2011, as part of the Montreal-based Public Bike System Company's (PBSC) BIXI brand of bike shares. In 2014, the system was taken over by the Toronto Parking Authority following PBSC's financial difficulties, and was rebranded as Bike Share Toronto. Expansion of the system took place in the late 2010s, increasing the system to a total of 6850 bicycles and 625 stations. The system covers over of the city, with bike stations are located in an area bounded by Finch Avenue in the north, Rouge Park in the east, Lake Ontario to the south, and to Long Branch to the west. Users can purchase yearly or monthly memberships and can then rent the bikes from any of the stations. Additional charges are incurred after the first half hour.\nThe system is the second bike sharing system in Toronto. The first was the Community Bicycle Network's popular BikeShare program which ran from 2001 to 2006 with approximately 150 bikes and 15 stations. It closed due to a lack of long-term grant funds and lack of alternative funding sources to cover all the costs, such as advertising revenues or membership fees.\nPublic transit.\nAll TTC buses have bicycle racks. Bicycles are allowed on the subway outside of the morning and evening rush hours. The Toronto Bike Plan, in the \"Cycling and transit\" chapter, aims to improve accessibility to bikes on transit as well as parking at transit locations.\nAdditionally, GO Transit also provides bike racks on all their bus routes, and allows bicycles on their trains outside of weekday rush hours. As of 2008, folding bicycles are allowed at all times, including rush hour. Summer GO Train service to Niagara includes dedicated bicycle cars which have all seats on the bottom floor removed and replaced with bicycle racks.\nOrganizations.\nCompared to many North American cities, Toronto has a well-established municipal government Cycling Office. It has been in charge of fulfilling the Toronto Bike Plan by adding bike lanes, hosting Bike Month, and CAN-Bike. The City previously had a Toronto Cycling Advisory Committee that existed to advise the Transportation Department and City Council on cycling issues. The committee was not re-established for the 2010-2014 Council term.\nThere are also a number of independent cycling organizations in Toronto providing advocacy, recreational and community economic development services:\nStatistics.\nNumber of cyclists.\nA 1999 Decima Research study showed that 48 percent of Torontonians were cyclists and 60% of households owned bicycles. During the peak summer months, cyclists in Toronto made more than three million trips per week, including over 1.6 million recreation trips. Approximately 20 percent of the population (388,000) are utilitarian cyclists, riding to work and school, going shopping, running errands or going visiting.\nThe largest age groups of utilitarian and recreational cyclists were the 18-34 and 35-39 age groups. Gender-wise cyclists split about 60 percent male and 40 percent female. 23 percent of utilitarian cyclists continue to cycle through the winter whereas only 5 percent of recreational cyclists do the same. Bicycle ownership and recreational cyclists levels were fairly level across the city. Utility cycling, however, is much higher in Central Toronto (comprising York, East York and Old Toronto). Utilitarian cyclists are much more concerned about careless drivers, poor road conditions and car doors opening in comparison to non-cyclists and recreational cyclists.\nSafety.\nThe 2003 Toronto Bicycle/Motor-Vehicle Collision Study found that cycling collisions in Toronto were most frequent on arterial roads, particularly on central east–west routes where cycling volumes are high. The majority of collisions occurred at intersections and most of those involved motor-vehicle turning manoeuvres.\nAway from intersections, collisions most often involved a motorist overtaking a cyclist, or opening a car door in the path of a cyclist. In the central area of the city, the most frequent type of collision involved a motorist opening their car door in the path of a cyclist. Almost 30% of the cyclists were cycling on the sidewalk immediately prior to their collisions.\nTourism.\nThe Toronto-Niagara Bike Train Initiative has helped connect Toronto cyclists with Niagara Region bike trails via Via Rail. The Waterfront Trail organization has been instrumental in getting a mostly-continuous bike trail across a large stretch of the north shore of Lake Ontario, including Toronto. It has also promoted the trail as an interesting route for cycle tourism."

        "text": "The following is the list of World Series of Poker Main Event champions. The World Series of Poker (WSOP) is \"the oldest, largest, most prestigious, and most media-hyped gaming competition in the world\". It is held annually since 1970 in Las Vegas. Since 1972, the Main Event of the WSOP has been the $10,000 buy-in no-limit Texas Hold 'Em tournament. The winner of the WSOP Main Event receives a World Series of Poker bracelet, millions of dollars (with the exact amount based on the number of entrants), and the right to be considered the year's World Champion of Poker. From 2008 to 2016, the nine players who made it to the final table of the Main Event were called the November Nine, a reference to the fact that the final table was completed in November, months after the Main Event's preliminary rounds were completed.\nUntil 2005, the WSOP was held at Binion's Horseshoe. In 2005, the event moved to the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino. The 2005 Main Event was not played completely at the Rio. The final three tables, which comprised the final 27 players, played the conclusion of the event at Binion's Horseshoe. All the Main Events that followed the 2005 event were played completely at the Rio through 2019, as well as in 2021. Consequently, this made Joe Hachem the final player to win the Main Event at the original home of the World Series of Poker.\nMilestones.\nJohnny Moss was the first person to win the WSOP. Since then only Moss and Stu Ungar have won the Main Event three times; Ungar is the only one to have won three times in the freeze-out format. Moss, Ungar, Doyle Brunson and Johnny Chan are the only people who have won the Main Event two years in a row. Johnny Chan's second victory in 1988 was featured on the 1998 film \"Rounders\". Peter Eastgate was the youngest person to win the Main Event when he won it in 2008, at 22 years of age. He held that record for one year, when 21-year-old Joe Cada became the youngest Main Event champion.\nWorld Series of Poker Main Event.\nWorlds Series of Poker Europe Main Event.\nThe World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion effort of World Series of Poker-branded poker tournaments outside the United States. Since 1970, the bracelet events have occurred every year in Las Vegas. The inaugural WSOPE, held in 2007, marked the first time that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside Las Vegas. The 2007 Main Event, a GBP 10,000 buy-in no-limit hold 'em tournament, was won by Norwegian player Annette Obrestad on the day before her 19th birthday. This made her the youngest person to win a WSOP bracelet, a record that cannot be broken in the Las Vegas WSOP under current laws because the minimum legal age for casino gaming in Nevada is 21. Obrestad could play in the WSOPE because the minimum age for casino gaming in the United Kingdom is 18. The World Series of Poker Europe has a unique identity from the Las Vegas WSOP, but according to Harrah's will remain true to the traditions and heritage. The 2011 WSOP Europe main event was an 8-handed event.\nWorld Series of Poker Asia Pacific Main Event.\nThe World Series of Poker Asia Pacific (WSOP APAC) is the most recent expansion of World Series of Poker-branded tournaments outside the United States. On April 30, 2012, WSOP owner Caesars Entertainment and Australian casino Crown Melbourne announced that the first WSOP APAC would be launched with five bracelet events in April 2013.\nWorld Series of Poker Online Main Event.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 the World Series of Poker held an online poker series."

        "text": "This is a list of ice hockey games with the highest attendance on record. All of the games on this list were held in stadiums designed for field sports such as association football, gridiron football, and baseball. Four of the \"games\" listed were actually doubleheaders, in which a single ticket provided admission to two games held back-to-back. The fixed-roof Ford Field in Detroit hosted one doubleheader and a single game, and another was held at the retractable-roof Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen, Germany (with the roof closed for that game); all other games on the list were held in open-air venues. Most of these games were staged as special events, and all but one were played in the 21st century.\nAttendance in the 30,000 range was once quite common for major international matches held outdoors in the 1940s and 50s in Moscow's Lenin Stadium. Figures of this type are still common in bandy, a relative of ice hockey played outdoors.\nThe record for a Stanley Cup playoff game, as well as for an NHL game played in a teams' regular home stadium, is 28,183, which was set on April 23, 1996, at the Thunderdome during a Tampa Bay Lightning – Philadelphia Flyers game.\nA new record was set on December 11, 2010, when the University of Michigan's men's ice hockey team faced cross-state rival Michigan State in an event billed as \"The Big Chill at the Big House\". The game was played at Michigan's football venue, Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, with a capacity of 109,901, as of the 2010 football season. Ultimately, a crowd announced by the University of Michigan as 113,411, at that time the largest in the stadium's history (including football), saw the homestanding Wolverines win 5–0. \"Guinness World Records\", using a count of ticketed fans who actually entered the stadium instead of UM's figure of tickets sold, announced a final figure of 104,173."

        "text": "A Twenty20 International (T20I) is a form of cricket, played between two of the international members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), in which each team faces a maximum of twenty overs. The matches have top-class status and are the highest T20 standard. The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket. The first Twenty20 International match between two men's sides was played on 17 February 2005, involving Australia and New Zealand. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" reported that \"neither side took the game especially seriously\", and it was noted by \"ESPNcricinfo\" that but for a large score for Ricky Ponting, \"the concept would have shuddered\". However, Ponting himself said \"if it does become an international game then I'm sure the novelty won't be there all the time\".\nThis is a list of Australia Cricket team's Twenty20 International records.

        "title": "Lead climbing injuries",
        "text": "The greatest potential for injury while rock climbing occurs when a lead climber falls. Several published studies have researched climbing injuries, especially lead climbing injuries, and how to avoid them. Chances of neck and head injuries are very low and they can be avoided by falling correctly.\nInjuries from falling.\nLead falls are dangerous because the climber can fall twice the length of the rope between them, and their last piece of protection. Thus, a climber, who is 5 feet above their protection, will fall 10 feet. The fall can produce a significant force on the midsection, where the climbing rope is tied to their harness. Injuries from falling come in many forms. They range from mild skin abrasions to death. As rock climbing has become more popular, several studies have been published documenting the frequency and severity of injuries sustained by rock climbers in various circumstances. Each study provides slightly different information due to the differences in methods in obtaining data. One problem with all of the studies is that injuries are not always reported; therefore, it is difficult to determine how many climbers were actually injured because there is no way to determine how many climbers climbed in the given areas during the times the studies were conducted.\nA Prospective Study of Rock Climbing Injuries.\n\"A Prospective Study of Rock Climbing Injuries\", a study performed by Jonathon P. Wyatt, Gordon W. McNaughton, and Patrick T. Grant, registrars and consultants at the Accident and Emergency Department of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary surveyed patients from 1992-93 who checked in with climbing related injuries. While this study greatly lacked subjects, percentages of injuries to various body parts are consistent with studies, which reported more injuries. According to patients, 18 of 19 climbing-related injuries were directly caused by climbing falls. No distinction was made whether the falls were lead falls, or not. 15 climbers fell from the rock face to the ground, implying these were lead falls. Twelve of the 19 injuries sustained were bone fractures, including feet, shins, pelvis and lower back. The remaining seven were soft tissue injuries (ankle, knee, and ligaments). Ten injuries were to the lower extremities (legs and pelvic areas). These included three ankle injuries, three fractures of bones in the calf (tibia and fibula), and two lumbar spine fractures. Most importantly, none of the injuries were neck injuries.\nFalling correctly.\nFalling correctly can significantly reduce the chance of serious injury. Many climbing injuries are caused by climbers who grab something as they fall.\nClimbers that grab the ascending rope during a fall can sustain skin damage (from rope burns) on their hands, become caught in the last piece of protection, can unintentionally un-clip the belay point causing longer and more dangerous falls, and become tangled in the climbing rope. Climbers who grab their ropes above the tying knot might have their fingers amputated by the rope constricting around them. Grabbing pieces of protection during a fall can impale the climber's hand.\nSomeone who climbs 3-4 days a week might take 1000 lead falls a year, which increases the chance of injury because of a fall. However, by practicing the proper falling technique a climber can significantly reduce the chance of injury. Climbers should fall with their hands up and slightly forward and with feet down and slightly forward as well. This method of falling allows the climber to make contact with the wall with limbs that can absorb the force of impact, rather than with other less-absorbent parts of the body. After impact, the climber should grab the rope (as it is completely stretched out and unable to cause injury) in order to refrain from tipping upside down. This method of falling eliminates injuries caused by prematurely grabbing the rope or other pieces of protection, as well as virtually eliminating neck injuries.\nRock climbing injuries in Yosemite National Park.\nIn a 3½-year study performed in Yosemite National Park, California, William S. Bowie, Thomas K. Hunt, and Hubert A. Allen reviewed 451 injuries reported by 220 climbers. These injuries came from a variety of sources, but 144 climbers were injured in lead falls (65.45%).\nResearch was compiled as climbers were brought to the Yosemite Medical Clinic or were rescued by United States National Park Search and Rescue team. All injured climbers filled out a survey of their injuries. Nearly 227 of the 451 injuries reported were to the skin or subcutaneous tissue (the layer of fat between the skin and underlying tissues). Of the remaining injuries, 127 were to lower extremities including femur, knee, tibia/fibula, ankle, and foot. Twenty-nine were to upper extremities including shoulder, forearm, wrist, and hand. Twenty-five injuries were reported to the skull/brain. Of the remaining injuries, ten were sustained in the face and neck area.\nThis study also showed that falls are not the cause of injury; it depends on how the climber lands after the falls. The contact surface and shape determine the severity and type of their injuries. For example, in one case of injury, a woman fell 100 feet and only suffered a small laceration and minimal contusions. This is attributed to the fact that she hit no rocks during her fall and the rope decelerated her elastically. Conversely, in another case, a climber fell only 6 feet but hit a sharp ledge and suffered a compound fracture of his femur. In a third case, a climber fell 20 feet but hit the ground and suffered a concussion, rib fractures, and dislocated ankle. Thus, injury severity is likely and more determined by the shape of the rock hit, the angle of impact, and which body surface hit the rock, as opposed to the length of the fall.\nThis study importantly points out there were a total of thirty-five head and neck-related injuries. Only four injuries related to lead climbing were fatal—all of these were head injuries. However, only 7% of the total injuries reported were head injuries. Thus, it is unlikely, that a climber will break their neck when climbing.\nConclusion.\nEach of the studies discussed the effects of falling, and \"How Should a Climber Fall?\" also taught the best way to fall especially to avoid head and neck injuries. The Yosemite study points out that injury usually is not related to the distance of the fall nor the frequency of falls: it depends more on the rock surface the climber hits. In reviewing these studies of climbing injuries, and focusing mainly on lead climbing injuries, it is apparent that the chance of major injury is relatively slim, that potential injuries to the head and neck are slimmer, and that minor injuries, though more common, seem to be infrequent as well."

        "title": "Don Brown (American football coach)",
        "text": "Don Brown (born July 31, 1955) is an American college football coach and former player. He is the head football coach at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass), a position he held from 2004 to 2008 and resumed prior to the 2022 season. In between his two stints as UMass, Brown was the defensive coordinator at the University of Maryland, College Park, the University of Connecticut, Boston College, the University of Michigan, and the University of Arizona. He served as the head football coach at Plymouth State University from 1993 to 1995 and Northeastern University from 2000 to 2003. Brown was also the interim head baseball coach at Yale University in 1992, tallying a mark of 26–10.\nEarly life and college.\nBrown was born in Spencer, Massachusetts, where he attended David Prouty High School. He went on to play football as a fullback at Norwich University. Brown graduated in 1977. In 1996, he earned a master's degree from Plymouth State University.\nCoaching career.\nEarly positions.\nBrown began his college coaching career as an assistant, first at Dartmouth, which won the Ivy League conference title during his tenure, and then at Mansfield University of Pennsylvania. In 1984, he returned to Dartmouth as its defensive coordinator. In 1987, he took the same position at Yale.\nYale baseball.\nBrown was named the interim head baseball coach at Yale during the 1992 season. Brown led the Bulldogs to a 26–10 record, including a 14–4 mark in the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League (EIBL), the EIBL championship and a bid to the NCAA tournament. Competing in the Midwest Regional, Yale lost the opener to Clemson, before taking an elimination game against Nichols State. The Bulldogs were then eliminated by UCLA.\nPlymouth State.\nIn 1993, Brown assumed his first head coaching job at Plymouth State University, a Division III school, and he held that position for three seasons. During his last two years, he led the team to win the Freedom Football Conference championship and advanced to the Division III playoffs. Brown was named the Freedom Conference Coach of the Year all three of his seasons at Plymouth State. In 1994, he was also named the American Football Coaches Association District I Coach of the Year.\nAssistant coach.\nBrown and UMass.\nIn 1996, he took over as the defensive coordinator at Brown University, where he remained for two years. In his second season, Brown posted its best record (7–5) in 20 years and led the nation with a school record 28 interceptions and ranked second in takeaways with 36. Opponents scored an average of 19.4 points per game.\nIn 1998, Brown moved to the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) as its defensive coordinator. That year, UMass won the Division I-AA national championship. In 1999, they earned a share of the Atlantic 10 championship and secured another berth in the Division I-AA playoffs.\nNortheastern.\nFrom 2000 to 2003, Brown held his second head coaching job at Northeastern University. The season prior to his arrival, the Huskies finished with a 2–9 record. In 2000, Northeastern scored a 35–27 upset victory over Division I-A Connecticut. In 2002, he led Northeastern to an 11th-place final ranking, the school's highest-ever placement. The Huskies' ten wins were also the most in school history. That season, he was named Atlantic 10 Conference Coach of the Year, New England Football Writers Coach of the Year, and American Football Coaches Association Region I Coach of the Year. In 2003, he led the Huskies to a third-place finish in the Atlantic 10, and the eight-win season matched the second-most in school history. Northeastern was the only team to record a victory against Delaware, which went on to become the Division I-AA champions. In 2003 Brown signed a contract with Northeastern through the end of the 2009 football season, but then breached his contract in 2004 to work for UMass.\nUMass.\nIn 2004, Brown returned to UMass to take over as its head coach. During his tenure as head coach from 2004 to 2008, UMass posted the best five-year record in school history, 43–19. In his first year, he led the Minutemen to a 6–5 record, including victories over fourth-ranked Colgate, seventh-ranked , and ninth-ranked . During 2005, Brown led UMass to a 7–2 start and a final ranking of #19. That year, the Minutemen defeated fourth-ranked James Madison and handed Delaware their worst home loss in two decades, 35–7.\nIn 2006, Brown led Massachusetts to the Atlantic 10 conference championship and a finish as runners-up in the national championship. They ended the season ranked No. 2 with a 13–2 record. At home, he set a school record with a perfect 8–0 record in McGuirk Stadium. That season, Brown was named the AFCA Region I Coach of the Year, Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year, and New England Football Coach of the Year.\nIn 2007, UMass again won its conference as a member of the Colonial Athletic Association. The team advanced to the semifinals and finished the season with a No. 6 final ranking.\nSecond stint as assistant coach.\nMaryland.\nOn January 9, 2009, the University of Maryland announced the hiring of Brown as its defensive coordinator, which filled the vacancy created by the departure of Chris Cosh. Maryland paid UMass a $25,000 buyout in accordance with the terms of Brown's contract. With a dearth of experience and talent, especially on the offensive line, Maryland suffered a 2–10 record during the 2009 season. The loss of cornerback Nolan Carroll due to a broken leg was cited as a serious detriment for the defense. The defense struggled to pressure opposing quarterbacks with the implementation of Brown's aggressive, blitz-oriented scheme. Maryland finished tied for last in the Atlantic Coast Conference in scoring defense, allowing an average of 31.2 points per game and caused just 12 turnovers and recorded 27 sacks. The lower than expected figures were attributed to a lack of players suited to the defensive scheme.\nWith a year of experience in Brown's defense and a stronger secondary, the unit was expected to improve during the 2010 season. Maryland rebounded with a 9–4 record and a bowl game victory, with a markedly improved defense. \"The Washington Post\" described Brown's scheme as \"organized chaos\" and \"blitzing nearly 85 percent of the time.\" Highly touted junior safety Kenny Tate emerged as a playmaker, and Brown praised his play at \"virtually every position on the field\" as \"unbelievable\". Brown was credited with preparing the team well for the 2010 Military Bowl, where Maryland beat the 12th-ranked offense of East Carolina, 51–20. After the season, head coach Ralph Friedgen was fired, and Brown stated a desire to remain at Maryland on the next coaching staff.\nConnecticut and Boston College.\nOn February 4, 2011, Brown was hired as the defensive coordinator at the University of Connecticut. He kept that position until December 19, 2012, when he was hired to serve the same position at Boston College.\nMichigan.\nOn December 21, 2015, Brown was named defensive coordinator at Michigan under head coach Jim Harbaugh. Brown replaced former defensive coordinator D. J. Durkin, who had departed to take the head coaching job at Maryland. Brown was fired from Michigan on December 22, 2020, after five seasons. Under Brown, Michigan's defense was ranked 2nd (2016), 6th (2017), 8th (2018) and 10th (2019) but dropped to 56th in 2020.\nArizona.\nIt was announced on January 6, 2021, that Jedd Fisch would name Brown as the defensive coordinator at the University of Arizona. After taking over, he improved Arizona’s defense from the previous 2020 season, which was the 100th ranked defense, to the 57th ranked total defense.\nSecond stint at UMass.\nIn November 2021 UMass, now an FBS independent, again hired Brown as its head coach.\nCoaching philosophy.\nBrown is regarded as one of the top defensive minds in the country. He has led FBS programs to close to a dozen top-10 national finishes in total defense, with three of those seasons in the top three. He is known for coaching aggressive, high-energy, hard-hitting defenses. Sometimes nicknamed “Dr. Blitz” for his defenses always being on the attack, he is also known for being a players' coach. He believes in players taking accountability for themselves and each other, and in leaders rising as a result. Brown stresses discipline, technique, and fundamentally sound football.\nDevelopment.\nBrown is known for maximizing players' potential and developing players to the next level. He has coached over 50 All-Big Ten and numerous other all-conference players. He has coached numerous NFL players and coached seven All-Americans: Devin Bush Jr., Lavert Hill, Chase Winovich, Chris Wormley, and consensus picks Maurice Hurst Jr., Jourdan Lewis, and Jabrill Peppers. At UMass he coached NFL players such as Victor Cruz, James Ihedigbo, Jeremy Cain, Emil Igwenagu, and Vladimir Ducasse."

        "text": "The National Sevens is a rugby sevens tournament for New Zealand provincial teams. It is held annually and features a men's event and a women's event. The best teams in the country compete over two days for the respective men's and women's titles. The tournament is currently held in Tauranga.\nThe National Sevens also serves as an opportunity for players to be selected in New Zealand's national sevens teams.\nHistory.\nThe National Sevens was first held in 1975 in Auckland, where Marlborough were the very first champions. Since then the tournament has been held every year (except 1987, 1988, and 2003) and held at various venues. A women's competition was introduced for the 1998 tournament in Roturura. In the first three decades Palmerston North hosted the National Sevens thirteen times, the last of which was in 2002. This was also the last tournament to host women's sevens until women's teams were reintroduced a decade later.\nThe National Sevens moved to Queenstown for ten seasons from 2004. The 2009 event was the first tournament where the entire event was screened live by Sky TV. A women's competition was reinstated in 2013. The National Sevens was relocated to Rotorua in 2014 and then to Tauranga in December 2018.\nFormat.\nThe sixteen teams for men are divided into four pools. On day one each team plays the other three teams in its pool. The top two teams from each pool qualify for the championship playoffs while the bottom two enter the bowl competition.\nVenue.\nThe first tournament was held in Auckland in 1975. From there it moved to various venues around the country: Christchurch, Blenheim, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Feilding, Pukekohe and Rotorua. From 2004 to 2013 it was hosted in Queenstown at the Recreation Ground, which is usually the home of the Wakatipu Rugby Club. The tournament then returned to Rotorua for five seasons and, since December 2018, it is held in Tauranga.\nParticipants.\nThe following teams have participated in the tournament:\nResults by year.\nMen's tournament.\nNational Sevens winners since 1975:\n1975–2002.\nNotes\n There were two events in 1996 due to a seasonal switch from March to November. Waikato won four titles between 1996 and 1998.\n2004–2013.\nThe National Sevens switched from a November schedule to a January schedule for the 2003–04 season and, as such, the 2002 tournament was followed by the 2004 tournament. The new venue was the Recreation Ground in Queenstown which hosted the National Sevens for ten years from 2004 to 2013.\n2014 onwards.\nThe tournament moved from Queenstown to Rotorua in 2014 for five seasons. A switch from playing in January to December coincided with the event moving to Tauranga for the 2018–19 season.\nWomen's tournament.\nWomen's teams initially competed at the National Sevens from 1998 through to 2002. After a ten-season absence, the women's tournament was reintroduced for the 2013 National Sevens held in Queenstown, with Manawatu earning the title. The tournament then moved to Rotorua in 2014 for five seasons. A switch from playing in January to December coincided with the event moving to Tauranga for the 2018–19 season."

        "title": "Bermuda Lacrosse Association",
        "text": "The Bermuda Lacrosse Association is a group based on the island of Bermuda with the goal of promoting the sport of lacrosse on the island territory. The Bermuda Lacrosse Association is a member of the Federation of International Lacrosse and has participated at two previous World Championships, the 2006 World Lacrosse Championships in London, Ontario, Canada and the 2008 International Lacrosse Federation Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada.\nThe Bermuda Lacrosse Association has been a registered charity in Bermuda since 2006 and is recognised by the Department of Youth and Sport in Bermuda.\nFoundation.\nLacrosse in Bermuda has its foundations in the 1980s and 1990s when US high school and collegiate teams visited the island during spring break to participate in training camps and tournaments in the warmer winter climate prior to spring leagues.\nThe current form of the Bermuda Lacrosse Association has its foundational roots in 2002 when a Bermudian, Kirk Bridgewater and two expatriates American Andy Soucie and Canadian Ernie Theriault got together and attempted to bring together a recreational game of lacrosse on the island. Initial pick-up games were played at Bernard Park with any available equipment on the island, including a batch of sticks donated by a Canadian box lacrosse team. Equipment was so sparse on the island that initially the goals consisted of garbage cans and parking gate fences until nets were constructed from PVC pipe and fishing net, items readily available on the island. For the first two years due to a lack of players and equipment, games were played with one net reverting to teams clearing and turning around to attack the same goal.\nOnce membership began to pick up, games were moved to Prospect Field (aka. Gymnasium Field) next to National Stadium as the location was better suited to collecting errant shots. Proper equipment was shipped in from the United States but due to a lack of goaltenders, goals were often draped in \"shooter tutors\".\nIn 2004, the first ever Tri-Nations tournament would be held with three local teams, representing Bermuda, Canada and the United States (based upon the player's place of origin) was held with Canada winning the initial tournament. This tournament has been held twice yearly since with the United States facing Canada in every final and the United States coming out on top. In 2008, Bermuda Lacrosse expanded to include the \"King of the Rock\" tournament open to post-collegiate teams from outside of Bermuda.\nInternational Lacrosse.\nIn 2005, Bermuda Lacrosse made the decision to attempt to improve its program by participating in tournaments outside of Bermuda. One of its members, Evan Schemenauer with previous experience in organising Bermudian teams to play internationally made contact with the International Lacrosse Federation about potential membership and participation in the 2006 World Lacrosse Championships. With a favorable response from the ILF, Bermuda Lacrosse began its long road towards the World Championships. With only a small talent pool to choose from, the Bermuda team consisted of players ranging from ages 17 to 51. The team composed of players which most everyone resided on the island of Bermuda.\nThe team was placed in the Yellow group alongside Finland, Denmark, Spain and Latvia. Bermuda lost each game, 10-6 versus Denmark, 16-3 versus Finland, 13-9 versus Spain and 9-3 versus Latvia. This left Bermuda fifth in the group and played New Zealand in the playoff round, losing 19-6 and finishing the tournament in 21st and last place. Despite finishing last, Bermuda Lacrosse made a lasting impression on the ILF through team spirit wearing their traditional blue blazers and red Bermuda shorts which have become a custom at all ILF/FIL events.\nWorld Under 19 Championships.\nBermuda made its first appearance at the 2008 International Lacrosse Federation Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada. The team that represented Bermuda consisted mostly of Bermudian resident students that were attending boarding schools in the United States, Canada and England where they had learned to play the game. Bermuda was placed in the Red Division alongside Finland, Wales, Germany, Scotland and South Korea. Bermuda opened with a win over Finland 11-5 and a win over Wales 6-5. Bermuda then lost to the top team in the division Germany 15-7 making for a decisive game against Scotland for the right for promotion. An 8-7 third quarter lead evaporated as Bermuda fell 13-8 to Scotland, eliminating Bermuda from contention for the play-in games and a top 8 finish. Bermuda concluded the round robin with an 8-4 victory over South Korea. In the play-off round, Bermuda beat Finland 5-4 to advance to the 9th place game, where they fell 8-3 in the rematch with Wales to finish 10th overall.\nBermuda recently completed in the 2010 World Lacrosse Championships in Manchester, England. The team was placed in the Yellow Division with Poland, Denmark and Finland. The Barracuda's opened play with back to back losses: a 2-16 match with Poland and a 5-11 outcome against Finland. They then turned in a strong 11-8 victory against Denkmark to finish pool play. The squad started the Qualifying competition in a rematch with Poland, falling in a closely contested 14-10 loss. They bounced back with an impressive 8-4 victory over Norway. This win placed Bermuda in the playoffs with against a very physical Latvia, with Bermuda prevailing in an 8-7 victory. They concluded play with a 12-7 loss to Slovakia, ending the Championships in 18th place with a 3-4 record.\nTeam Colours.\nBermuda Lacrosse has adopted a logo of a barracuda with a large snarling face holding a lacrosse stick.

        "text": "The 1998 NCAA Division I baseball tournament was played at the end of the 1998 NCAA Division I baseball season to determine the national champion of college baseball. The tournament concluded with eight teams competing in the College World Series, a double-elimination tournament in its fifty-second year. Eight regional competitions were held to determine the participants in the final event. Each region was composed of six teams, resulting in 48 teams participating in the tournament at the conclusion of their regular season, and in some cases, after a conference tournament. The fifty-second tournament's champion was Southern California, coached by Mike Gillespie. The championship was the Trojans' record 12th, but their first since 1978, the last under coach Rod Dedeaux. The Most Outstanding Player was USC second baseman Wes Rachels.\nRegionals.\nThe opening rounds of the tournament were played at eight regional sites across the country, each consisting of a six-team field. Each regional tournament is double-elimination, however region brackets are variable depending on the number of teams remaining after each round. Regional games were scheduled for Thursday, May 21 through Sunday, May 24; however, one final Sunday game (Arizona State vs. Georgia Tech at Wichita) had to be played the next day due to rainout. The winners of each regional advanced to the College World Series.\nIn the final year of the 48-team tournament, six regionals required the full 11 games. Only Florida State and LSU advanced to the CWS unscathed, while Long Beach State won four games over three days after losing their first to North Carolina St.&lt;br&gt;\nBold indicates winner.\nCollege World Series.\nThe 1998 CWS was infamous for producing several high-scoring games, which was termed by media covering the Series as \"Gorilla Ball\" (or \"Geaux-rilla Ball\" among LSU fans), which placed a premium on home runs. LSU, which won the 1996 and 1997 national championships and set an NCAA record in 1997 by hitting 188 home runs, hit eight home runs in its first game (by seven different players) vs. USC, and added six more in its second game vs. Mississippi State to bring its season total to 157. Needing one victory to advance to the championship game for the third consecutive year, LSU fell twice to USC, hitting just one home run in 18 innings. USC and Pac-10 rival Arizona St. set numerous offensive records in the championship game, won by the Trojans 21–14.\nPrior to the 1999 season, the NCAA adopted restrictions on aluminum bats, requiring the difference between the length and weight (\"drop\") of the bat to be no more than three (e.g. a 34-inch bat could not weigh less than 31 ounces). This reduced home run output slightly, but it was not until more sweeping changes in 2011 before aluminum bats would perform more like their wood counterparts.\nResults.\nBracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAll-Tournament Team.\nThe following players were members of the College World Series All-Tournament Team."

        "title": "Challenge Cup (ice hockey)",
        "text": "The Challenge Cup International AAA Championship Showcase (colloquially known as the Challenge Cup or simply The Cup) is an international ice hockey tournament held annually in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia for ice hockey teams from around the world. Ages range from Novice Minor (age 9) to Midget Major (age 18) for both girls and boys and the tournament is traditionally held on the weekend of the Canadian holiday Victoria Day.\nWithin each age level, teams are divided into three divisions: A, B, and C. During the exhibition round and round-robin play, teams play games with opponents within their own division. Upon completion of round-robin play, teams enter the elimination round. Teams play compete within their own divisions and later play teams in other divisions. Teams with the most wins are considered tournament winners. Points are distributed in the following order: three points for a regulation win, two points for an overtime win, one point for an overtime loss, and zero points for a regulation loss. Ties are decided in this order: 1) Most points; 2) Team with the greatest number of wins; 3) Games against team with equal record; 4) Penalty minute differential; 5) Basic goal differential GF (goals For) – GA (goals Against); 6) Total goal differential GF–GA/GF; 7) Team with the fewest penalty minutes.\nHistory.\nFirst held in 1992 as a relatively obscure tournament, the Challenge Cup has grown in prestige, particularly in the local community, particularly the Lower Mainland where the tournament ranks as one of the most significant events on the hockey calendar. Since its opening ceremonies on May 22, 1992, and the first finals on May 24, 1992, the tournament has grown to over 250 expected teams in 2010, another increase from previous years. In 2008 and 2009, the tournament hosted 186 teams, and 220 teams respectively. Among the divisions with the most teams are Bantam Minor (24 teams), Pee-Wee minor (24 teams), and Atom Major (26 teams). In 2007, there were even fewer teams, at 161. The opening ceremonies are always kicked off with a speech from the Challenge Cup's celebrity guest Walter Gretzky.\nWalter Gretzky's appearances.\nWalter Gretzky, the prestigious father of NHL superstar Wayne Gretzky, makes an annual appearance at the tournament. He is involved in the opening ceremonies each year, to give the opening speech to all teams and participants involved, followed by an autograph session held in the upper lobby. Walter also actively participates in helping some of the younger players, in making pre-game appearances to the teams.\nOther celebrity guest appearances.\nThere have not been many other celebrity guests that have made their appearances to the tournament in the past years, except Walter Gretzky, of course. In the past few years, there have been two appearances by Garry Unger in 2008, and returned again in 2009. Gary played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League from 1967 until 1983. Unger holds the second longest consecutive games streak in NHL history, with 914 consecutive games played during the regular season between February 24, 1968 and December 21, 1979. Doug Jarvis holds the current record at 964 consecutive games. Unger ended up playing 1105 career NHL games, scoring 413 goals and 391 assists for 804 points, and he also registered 1075 career penalty minutes.\nTournament statistics.\n2010 champions.\nNote that as a result of the large number of teams in the 2010 tournament, some age levels played in two different divisions. A higher numbered division does not represent a more skilled team.\nSkills competition.\nWinners are chosen and based on four categories. These events seem to serve at least two purposes: the first is to establish bragging rights between athletes for possessing a particular skill needed to succeed in the game, and the second is to increase revenue for those that sponsor the event. Skills contests are often held during an All-star break, but in this tournament, they are held as a part of a mid-tournament break, usually during the second day of competition, and usually the players get the entire afternoon off.\nFastest skater.\nPlayers skate two laps, one forward and one backward. A pivot is made between center ice and the blue line after finishing one lap. The player with the fastest recorded time wins.\nHardest shot.\nThe speed of the player's shot (players take two shots) on net is recorded with a radar gun. The shot \"must\" hit the net to count. The fastest shot wins. If there is a radar gun malfunction, or if a radar gun is unavailable, a Most Accurate Shot competition will take place in lieu of the Hardest Shot. Players will be required to hit indicated targets in a limited amount of time.\nBest puck handler.\nPlayers will skate with a puck through an indicated route, most likely marked with cones. Players must complete the entire course with the puck, and having not lost any control whatsoever during their routine. The player with the fastest recorded time wins.\nShowdown.\nA player is required to take three breakaways in less than thirty seconds. Distances to the goal will vary between age groups. Saves and goals are recorded for each shooter and goalie. The goalie with the most saves wins, and the shooter with the most goals scored in the fastest recorded time wins. If necessary, goalies will perform a series of timed movement exercises to determine which goalie advances to the final round if their saves count is equal after the Round-Robin series."

Long Beach State was attempting to become the first program to go undefeated in more than one season, as they went 36-0 just 3 years before in 1998.\nOn their way to the title, Stanford was able to knock off defending champion Nebraska in the national semifinals. The other semifinal participant, Arizona, made the program's first NCAA Final Four appearance.\nThe win gave Stanford head coach John Dunning, who was in his first year as Stanford's head coach, his third NCAA title as he won two with Pacific in the 1980s.\nThis was the first year of rally point scoring in the NCAA Division I tournament, with games going to 30 points to win. Previous years used the side out scoring (SOS), with 15 points needed to win. Games became \"sets\" in 2008 and were reduced to 25 points to win.\nNational Semifinals.\nLong Beach State vs. Arizona.\nTop ranked and undefeated Long Beach State easily defeated Arizona in three sets. Tayyiba Haneef led Long Beach with 21 kills. Long Beach out-hit Arizona .384 to .216, out-blocked the Wildcats 10 to 8 and had 8 service aces while Arizona had just 3. Arizona was led by Shannon Torregrosas's 14 kills. Arizona ended their season at 25-5 with the program's first ever Final Four appearance. Long Beach upped their record to 33-0.\nStanford vs Nebraska.\nLed by Logan Tom's 22 kills, Stanford knocked off defending national champion Nebraska in three sets. Ogonna Nnamani added 13 kills to help the Cardinal sweep. Stanford out-blocked Nebraska, 12 to 9, and hit .270 as a team while Nebraska hit just .186. Nancy Metcalf led Nebraska with 14 kills as Nebraska ended their season at 31-2. Stanford advanced to the program's ninth NCAA title match.\nNational Championship: Long Beach State vs. Stanford.\nIn the title match, Stanford stunned top ranked and previously undefeated Long Beach State in three sets.\nIn game 1, Stanford went up 20-14 before Long Beach State closed the gap to 23-22. Down 26-24, Long Beach State rallied off four straight points, and eventually earned game point at 29-27. The 49'ers squandered both opportunities, with a Logan Tom kill and a Long Beach hitting error tying it up at 29. A Tom kill gave Stanford the game, 31-29. It was the first time all season that Long Beach lost the first game of a match.\nIn game 2, Stanford went up 11-7, then extended the lead to 20-13. Stanford remained in control, going up 27-20 and earning game point at 29-23. Long Beach State, however, did not go away and reeled off five consecutive points to cut the deficit to 29-28. The comeback ended, however, on a 49er service error giving Stanford the game, 30-28.\nGame 3 remained even midway through. Stanford led 15-14 at the media timeout, before a Logan Tom service ace gave the Cardinal some separation at 25-21. Stanford remained ahead, going up 28-24 after an Ogonna Nnamani kill, before earning championship point after a Tom kill. A Stanford block ended the match, 30-25, ending Long Beach State's undefeated season, while Stanford ended their season at 33-2 - with one of the losses coming from Long Beach State earlier in the year.\nStanford won their fifth NCAA title. The win over Long Beach improved Stanford's record to 2-0 against undefeated teams in the national championship, as Stanford beat previously undefeated UCLA in the 1992 final. Stanford head coach John Dunning became the first Division I coach to win the national championship at two different schools, as he led Pacific to back-to-back titles in 1985 and 1986."

        "title": "Brighton and Hove Cricket Club",
        "text": "Brighton and Hove Cricket Club, nicknamed \"The Mighty Bensons\", is an amateur cricket club based in East Sussex, in southern England. Their top team secured the Sussex Cricket League championship in 2000 and in 2007. Based since 1991 at the Nevill Sports Ground in Hove, southern England, the club achieved success in 1979 when it won both the first and second eleven competitions in the Sussex League, while playing at Horsdean.\n2010 England wicket keeper and batsman, Matt Prior, has been a member of the club, as has the former England captain, Tony Greig and the New Zealand opening batsman Mark Richardson.\nClub history.\nCounty Ground.\nBrighton &amp; Hove Cricket Club was founded on 22 August 1945, as an amalgamation of Hove Cricket Club (founded in 1918) and Brighton Nondescripts Cricket Club (founded in 1920). The club was based at the County Ground in Hove, Sussex, although all Sunday games had to be played away from home.\nWithdean Stadium.\nBy 1955 it was clear that the club could not remain at the County Ground and in the following year it moved to a very small ground next to the Withdean Stadium in Brighton. Here the club enjoyed a good family atmosphere, but the facilities were primitive and the use of the ground as a rugby pitch during the winter, and even as a collecting ring for a horse show, made playing-conditions dangerous. The Club found a temporary refuge at Longhill School in 1969 before moving to Horsdean.\nHorsdean.\nAt Horsdean, too, there were problems with the use of the playing surface for rugby during the winter, and the clubhouse was hardly suitable to be used as a cricket pavilion. But the square was improved until it became one of the best in club cricket, and this helped the club to achieve an increasing amount of success. The high point came in 1979 when the club won both the first and second eleven competitions in the Sussex League.\nAt the end of the 1990 season, however, a long-standing threat from the construction of a road bypass became a reality. With no sign of a replacement ground, the club spent 1991 without a venue, playing all Sunday matches away, but fulfilling its League fixtures thanks to the kindness of Brighton Polytechnic, on whose pitch they were allowed to play.\nNevill Ground.\nTowards the end of the 1991 season, the club was offered the use of the Nevill Ground by Hove Borough Council, which was in the process of renovating the clubhouse. Ironically, this was one of the grounds the club had considered moving to in 1956 and rejected. The club eagerly accepted the council's offer, work began on the square that autumn, and since then the club enjoyed a happy collaboration with Hove Borough Council. Improvements at the Nevill Sports Arena provided the club with excellent facilities for the 2009 season.\nAchievements.\nWith several players having represented their Counties, or attended the University Center of Cricketing Excellence – a scheme set up by the England and Wales Cricket Board – the Club stands as one of the most highly profiled amateur cricket clubs in England and Wales.\nThe most recent former player with Brighton and Hove Cricket Club to make a name for himself is Matthew Prior, who signed for Sussex County Cricket Club and has since gone on to earn himself many England caps. Another international cricketer to play for \"The Mighty Bensons\" is New Zealender Mark Richardson, who has a century against England to his name. Tony Greig, who captained England in the 1970s, has been a member of Brighton and Hove Cricket Club.\nAlso brothers Alen and Colin Wells (Sussex and England) Alan (Sussex) and RP(Roly)Willows (Middlesex and Lords Ground Staff) represented Brighton and Hove during the 1970 and 1980 along with Jerry Morley and Andy Dindar (Middlesex)."

The team, which plays in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC), is led by second-year head coach Gregg Marshall. The Shockers opened the season with a win over Florida A&amp;M on November 10, 2008, and ended the season with a loss to Stanford in the College Basketball Invitational. Their final record for 2008–09 was 17–17 (8–10 MVC), a huge improvement from their 2007–08 record of 11–20 (4–14 MVC).\nRegular season.\nThe Shockers started out with mediocre level of play, but performed well against then ranked Michigan St. and Georgetown and even beat a very good Siena team in the Old Spice Classic at the end of November. On February 21, the Shockers beat a Cleveland State team with an RPI of almost a hundred better than WSU's. Then came conference play. The Shockers lost their first 6 games in Missouri Valley play, and on January 14, were in dead last in the MVC. Then came the comeback. In the more-than-century-old MVC, 49 teams had started 0–6. None won more than five games in conference play for the rest of the season.\nPost-season.\nWichita State finished MVC play 8–10 but were not rewarded well with a 7 seed in the MVC tournament. They beat Missouri St. 59–46 in the play-in game at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, and now had to face a hot no. 2 Creighton team. It was a game no one expected them to win. The Shockers tried to keep close in the first half, but were down by 13 at halftime. Creighton came out and made a huge run in the second half, giving them a 22-point lead and a chance to embarrass Wichita State. But the Shockers did not give up, and shut Creighton down almost the rest of the way. They came within 13 with 3:43 to play in the game and 5 with about 1 minute. The Shockers were down 59–61 with about 10 seconds left, but had the ball. Toure' Murry, who had already had two game-saving shots this season, caught the inbounds pass and quickly shot a 3-pointer, which swished through the net. The Shockers had come back from 22 down to take the lead. With 9 seconds left, Creighton inbounded the ball and brought it all the way down, but shot a wild jumper that missed. A Shocker tried to grab the rebound but lost it out of bounds. Creighton had 1.8 seconds to take the lead. Booker Woodfox half-fumbled the inbounds pass, but threw up a 17-footer which swished right through. The Bluejays had escaped.\nThe Shockers were given a chance to bounce back from the heartbreak with a spot in the College Basketball Invitational, one of the NCAA's minor post-season tournaments made for improving teams. In the first round of the single-elimination tournament, Wichita State beat Buffalo by a score of 84–73. The Shockers season was then ended on March 23 with a 70–56 loss to Stanford in the second round of the CBI."

        "text": "The 2010 Rose Bowl, the 96th edition of the annual game, was a college football bowl game played on Friday, January 1, 2010, at Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California. It featured the Ohio State Buckeyes against the Oregon Ducks. The Buckeyes won 26–17.\nBecause of sponsorship by Citi, the first game in the 2010 edition of the Bowl Championship Series was officially titled the Rose Bowl Game presented by Citi. The contest was televised on ABC with a radio broadcast on ESPN Radio and XM Satellite Radio (Mike Tirico, Jon Gruden, and Shelley Smith), which began at 1:30 PM (PST) with kickoff at 2:10 PM (PST). The game was also broadcast on the Ohio State Sports Network WBNS 97.1 FM and Oregon Sports Network KUGN 590 AM. Ticket prices for all seats in the Rose Bowl were listed at $145.\nThe Rose Bowl Game was a contractual sell-out, with 64,500 tickets allocated to the participating teams and conferences. The remaining tickets went to the Tournament of Roses members, sponsors, City of Pasadena residents, and the general public.\nThis was the 22nd and final Rose Bowl televised by ABC. Corporate sibling ESPN took over coverage in 2011.\nThis game was a separate BCS game from the National Championship Game, which the Pasadena Tournament of Roses also hosted. The 2010 Citi BCS National Championship Game was held on January 7 at 5:00 PM (PST).\nPre-game activities.\nThe Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association announced the 2010 Royal Court on Monday, October 12, 2009, and the Rose Queen on Tuesday, October 20, 2009, at the Tournament House. The Queen, Natalie Innocenzi, and the Royal Court presided over the game. Also presiding at the game was Captain Chesley B. \"Sully\" Sullenberger III who was selected as the 2010 Rose Parade grand marshal, which was announced on Thursday, November 5, 2009.\nAfter the teams' arrival in Southern California, they participated in the traditional Lawry's Beef Bowl in Beverly Hills and the Disney Media Day at Disneyland in nearby Anaheim.\nThe 20th Anniversary of the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame induction ceremony was held at the Brookside golf club clubhouse on December 30, 2009. It was hosted by the Pasadena Quarterbacks Club, and Keith Jackson was the Master of Ceremonies. The honorees were former Wisconsin head coach Barry Alvarez, former Pac-10 commissioner Tom Hansen, and former Ohio State offensive tackle John Hicks.\nThe Rose Bowl Game Kickoff Luncheon on December 31, 2009, presented by Trader Joe's, was a celebration of the game by featuring the university coaches, athletes, marching bands and pep squads of the teams participating in the game, and the Rose Queen with her princesses and the 2009 Rose Bowl Game Hall of Fame inductees.\nThe bands and cheerleaders from both schools participated in the early morning Rose Parade on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California along with the floats from the two conferences.\nA salute to the men and women serving America throughout the world was scheduled before kickoff, with a flyover of four F-18 jets. The flyover was performed by pilots of the Fighting Redcocks of Strike Fighter Squadron 22 (VFA-22) from the Naval Air Station at Lemoore, California.\nTeams.\nThe teams were formally selected by the football committee of the Tournament of Roses on December 6, 2009. Ohio State represented the Big Ten Conference in the Rose Bowl as the conference's automatic bid after winning their 5th consecutive Big Ten championship by defeating Iowa 27–24 on November 14, 2009. Oregon represented the Pac-10 as the conference's automatic bid after defeating Oregon State 37–33 in the Civil War on December 3, 2009. The pairing of the two conferences in the Rose Bowl is the oldest college football agreement between two major conferences in the United States. Ohio State had previously played in thirteen Rose Bowl Games with a record of 6–7, winning their previous appearance over Arizona State 20–17 in the 1997 Rose Bowl. Oregon had previously played in four Rose Bowl Games with a record of 1–3, being defeated in their previous appearance by Penn State Nittany Lions 38–20 in the 1995 Rose Bowl. In its only Rose Bowl win, Oregon defeated the Penn Quakers 14–0 in the 1917 Rose Bowl.\nThe two teams had met seven times prior to this game, with the last coming on September 19, 1987, in Columbus, Ohio, where Ohio State defeated Oregon 24–14. This was the second time the two teams faced one another in the Rose Bowl. Ohio State defeated Oregon 10–7 in the 1958 Rose Bowl. Prior to the 2010 game, Ohio State was 7–0 all time against Oregon in football. It was the first time the outright Big Ten champion met the outright Pac-10 champion in the Rose Bowl since the 2004 Rose Bowl between Michigan and Southern California. Ohio State wore its white jerseys on the west sideline while Oregon wore its dark jerseys on the east.\nGame notes.\nOregon won the coin toss to begin the game and decided to defer to the second half.\nOhio State quarterback Terrelle Pryor was selected the game's offensive Most Valuable Player. His performance included passing for a season-high 266 yards and rushing for 72 yards. Oregon defensive end Kenny Rowe was the game's defensive Most Valuable Player. He recorded 3 sacks, tying a Rose Bowl Record.\nThe game lasted from 2:11 pm to 5:22 pm PT for a total elapsed time of 3 hours 11 minutes. The officials were Scott Novak (referee), John Mascarello (umpire), George Gusman (linesman), Walt Coleman (line judge), Terry Jones (back judge), Joe Blubaugh (field judge), Eugene Hall (side judge). The game time temperature was 71 deg, wind at 5 mph ESE, on a sunny afternoon.\nFollowing the game in June, Citi decided to end the sponsorship of the Rose Bowl game."

        "title": "Ian Johnson with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Ian Johnson was a member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948. Bradman's men went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\".\nAn off spinner, Johnson was a member of Bradman's first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final match. However, he was not prominent in the Tests, taking seven wickets at a bowling average of 61.00. Among the frontline bowlers who played in four or more Tests, Johnson had the worst average by a factor of almost two and took the fewest wickets. Johnson had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at a batting average of 10.20, but took five catches in the slips.\nJohnson had more success in the tour matches, taking 85 wickets at 18.37 in all first-class fixtures. This ranked him third among the Australians in the wicket-taking and fifth in the averages. He bowled more overs than everyone but Bill Johnston, allowing Bradman to ease the workload on pace spearheads Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, and conserve their energy for the Tests. Johnson's most successful match with the ball was against Gloucestershire, in which he took match figures of 11/100. He was also more prolific with the bat outside the Tests, scoring 543 runs at 30.16, with a top-score of 113 not out against Somerset. He also made 80 against a Marylebone Cricket Club team that consisted almost entirely of Test players. Johnson was prominent in the field, taking 23 catches, the most by a non-wicket-keeper on tour.\nEarly tour.\nAustralia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the opening match of the tour, which was usually against Worcestershire. Johnson had been a regular member of the Australian Test team since World War II, and was selected in Bradman's full-strength team.\nWorcestershire elected to bat first, and Johnson took 3/52 from 23 overs, the most bowled by any Australian, cleaning up the lower order as Australia removed the hosts for 233. When Australia batted, Johnson came in at No. 10 and made an unbeaten 12 as Australia declared their innings closed at 8/462. Australia dismissed the hosts for 212 to complete victory by an innings and 17 runs. Johnson took the last three wickets to end with 3/75 from 13.3 overs; he was the most uneconomical bowler among those who sent down more than 18 deliveries.\nJohnson played a major role in the next match against Leicestershire. He made six at No. 8 as Australia batted first and scored 448. Johnson came on with the hosts at 3/74 and took two quick wickets in the space of five runs, beginning a collapse that led to Leicestershire being all out for 130. He ended with 2/50 from 23 overs. Australia enforced the follow on, and Johnson broke through their top and middle order. The hosts reached 0/45 before Johnson took the first five wickets to reduce them to 5/88. Leicestershire progressed to 5/113 before Johnson took two more wickets in the space of four balls. He ended with 7/42 from 21 overs, his best first-class innings figures, as the home team were dismissed for 147, handing Australia victory by an innings and 171 runs.\nThe Australians proceeded to play Yorkshire, on a damp pitch conducive to slower bowling. Johnson was rested as Australia came closest to losing a match for the whole tour. Australia were 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory, before scraping home by four wickets.\nJohnson returned in the next match against Surrey at The Oval in London, where Australia won the toss and batted first. Batting at No. 6, Johnson came in at 4/444 and put on 99 runs with vice-captain and fellow South Melburnian Lindsay Hassett, before falling for 46; Australia were eventually bowled out for 632. Johnson then took five wickets to help cut down Surrey's first innings. The hosts reached 2/40 before Johnson claimed three middle order wickets to reduce them to 6/66. He later removed the final batsmen to end with 5/53 from 18.2 overs. Surrey were bowled out for 141 and forced to follow on and Johnson took 3/40 in the second innings as the home team made 195 to cede victory to Australia by an innings. Johnson removed captain Errol Holmes and Stuart Surridge in both innings.\nJohnson was rested for the next match against Cambridge University, which Australia won by an innings. In the following match against Essex, Johnson returned as Australia won the toss and batted first and went on to score 721, a world record for the most number of first-class runs in one day's play. He came in at 6/664 and was unable to join in the high scoring, making only nine as the lower order folded quickly, none of the four bowlers reaching double figures. Australia subsequently proceeded to victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the tour. Johnson was not required to bowl in the first innings as the pacemen dismissed the hosts for 83 in 36.5 overs. In the second innings, Johnson was given an opportunity and took four of the first six wickets to fall, reducing Essex to 6/46. The home side added 131 for the next wicket before Johnson removed their captain and top-scorer Tom Pearce for 71; he added another wicket as Essex were out for 187. Johnson finished with 6/37 from 21 overs. Johnson was rested for the next match against Oxford University, which resulted in another innings victory.\nThe eighth match of the season was against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Having been a regular member of the Test team since the end of World War II, and having taken 29 wickets at 12.03 in his four games on tour, Johnson was selected along with fellow spinner Colin McCool, a leg spinner. This meant that Australia's first-choice team was the same as in the opening match against Worcestershire. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up for Australia in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. It was a chance for both sides to gain a psychological advantage over the players who would oppose them in the Tests. Australia won the toss and batted first and Johnson came in at 5/343 to join former South Melbourne and Victorian team-mate and fellow Royal Australian Air Force fighter pilot Keith Miller. The pair put on 165 before Miller fell on the second morning, quickly followed by Johnson at 8/512, trapped leg before wicket by off spinner Jim Laker for 80, but not before Johnson had hit him for three sixes. Bradman's men went on to amass 552. Johnson was the least successful and most uneconomical Australian in the first innings, taking 0/43 from 12 overs as the hosts made 189. Bradman enforced the follow on and Johnson had a better return on the second attempt. The hosts reached 3/128 when Johnson caused a middle-order collapse. He had New Zealand Test batsman Martin Donnelly stumped by Don Tallon, before trapping English Test batsman Len Hutton leg before wicket five runs later. He then removed Ken Cranston to leave the MCC at 6/159. Johnson ended with 3/37 and caught Denis Compton from the pace bowling of Ray Lindwall as Australia bowled out the home side for 205 to win by an innings.\nThe MCC match was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which against Lancashire. Johnson had little to do in the match. After the first day was washed out, he was promoted to No. 4 and made only five in the first innings. He took 0/16 from eight overs in the first innings and neither batted nor bowled in the second innings as the match ended in a draw.\nIn the following match against Nottinghamshire, Johnson took 1/26 and made a duck in the first innings as the hosts batted first. He claimed 3/78 in the second innings as the match was drawn. In the next game against Hampshire, Australia had another scare. On a drying pitch, Johnson took 2/35 as Australia removed the hosts for 195. He then made two as Australia were dismissed for 117, the first time they had conceded a first innings lead on the tour. In the second innings, he took 0/13 in four overs as Hassett's opening bowlers took all the wickets; Hampshire were bowled out for 103 to leave Australia a target of 182 in 175 minutes. Johnson was promoted to No. 3 and came to the crease almost immediately when Sid Barnes fell before Australia had scored. Johnson hit out, striking three sixes and seven fours, making 74 in the partnership of 105 with Bill Brown. Johnson fell for 74, but Hassett came in and guided Australia to an eight-wicket win without further loss. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex. Johnson was neither required to bowl nor bat in the first innings. The pacemen dismissed the hosts for 86 in 46.4 overs before Australia declared at 5/549 in reply. Johnson registered 0/37 from 11 overs as Sussex fell for 138 to seal another innings victory for Australia.\nFirst Test.\nAlthough his four matches since the MCC fixture had yielded only six wickets at 34.16, Johnson was selected in the team for the First Test at Trent Bridge. McCool, the other spinner in the MCC and Worcestershire matches, had played in only one match since the MCC game, in which he was wicketless. McCool's omission was the only change from those two matches. Bill Johnston, who bowled left arm pace and orthodox spin was included in the team at the last minute in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket, following the arrival of rain. Johnston had taken match figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively, both on rain-affected wickets.\nEnglish captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits believed the pitch would be ideal for batting after giving some assistance to the fast bowlers in the first hour. Australia's pacemen reduced England to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165. Johnson was only given five overs and took 0/19 as the pacemen efficiently cut down the English batsmen in 79 overs.\nDuring the innings, Bill Edrich was on four when he edged Ray Lindwall to Johnson at first slip. Johnson got both hands to the ball above his head, but dropped it. However, the dropped catch was not costly, as Edrich was dismissed for 18.\nOn the third day, Australia reached 5/305 when Johnson came in to bat. He made 21 with three fours, including an edge over the slips cordon, before being bowled by Laker. Johnson hit the ball onto his foot, which deflected it back into his stumps. This left Australia at 6/338 but the lower order continued to contribute and pushed the total to 509, giving the tourists a 344-run lead.\nEngland began their second innings on the third afternoon. Late in the day, after scoring 13 in 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind by Don Tallon after attempting a cut shot from Johnson's bowling. Edrich did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. Denis Compton came in and he ran down the pitch before the first ball was bowled; he had to quickly block the ball on the run. He then survived a confident lbw appeal from the bowling of Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared resigned to his fate and ready to walk, but umpire Frank Chester declined the appeal. During this passage of play, Johnson extracted a substantial amount of spin from the surface. England closed the day at 2/121.\nThe light was again poor on the fourth day, but England did not appeal against it. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor visibility to erase the deficit and build a lead, to force Australia to chase a target on an erratic surface if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket. Bradman thought that rain might come, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensive leg theory so England would not be in the lead should a sticky wicket arise. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen.\nIn his first over at the start of the day, Johnson extracted sharp turn from one delivery that pitched outside off stump; not expecting much spin, Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads, but the umpire rejected the loud appeal for lbw. Otherwise, Len Hutton and Compton progressed steadily, although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly.\nSoon after reaching his century during the afternoon, Compton edged to the slips from the bowling of Miller, but Johnson spilled the catch. Compton went on to make 184 and England were eventually out for 441 on the final day. Johnson sent down 42 overs for a return of 1/66. He had the best economy rate of 1.57 runs per over, ahead of Toshack's 1.81; Bradman used both in a defensive manner. This left Australia a target of 98, which they reached with eight wickets to spare.\nBetween Tests, Johnson played in the match against Northamptonshire, which started the day after the First Test. He took three middle-order wickets and ended with 3/13 from 13 overs, the most economical figures among the Australians in the first innings, as the hosts were out for 119. He made only four in the bat and took 1/46 in the second innings as Australia cruised to an innings victory. After playing in seven consecutive matches comprising 21 days of cricket between 22 May and 18 June, Johnson was rested for the second match between Tests, which was a draw against Yorkshire.\nSecond Test.\nAustralia opted to field an unchanged team for the Second Test at Lord's and elected to bat first after winning the toss. Johnson came in at 5/216 on the first afternoon and struggled to score, making only four of the 30 runs added during his stay at the crease before falling at 7/246, caught behind from the bowling of Bill Edrich. However, Australia's lower order wagged and they eventually took the score to 350 on the second morning.\nAfter lunch, Hutton rocked onto the front foot, played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 2/32. The English opener had been uncertain against Johnson's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. Later in the afternoon, Denis Compton and captain Norman Yardley played Johnson cautiously but safely; in particular, Yardley repeatedly driving a series of overpitched balls from Johnson for runs. Johnson took the last two wickets to fall on the second day, having Alec Coxon caught and bowled for 19 and Laker caught behind for 28 after the pair had put on 41. England were out early on the third morning for 215. Johnson ended with 3/72, having sent down 35 overs, the most by any Australian.\nThe weather was fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon on the third day. Australia batted strongly and on the fourth day, Johnson came in at 6/445, with Australia already ahead by 580. He made nine before his partner Ray Lindwall was stumped, which prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460. This left England a victory target of 596, which would require a world record run chase.\nFurther showers forced a rain break immediately after England started their runchase and breathed extra life into the pitch. When the players returned, Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen.\nHutton and Washbrook took the score to 42—England's highest opening partnership of the series—before the former edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips and was out for 13. Soon after, Edrich edged to Johnson low down in the cordon and England were 2/52. Edrich decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken, thinking he may have hit a bump ball into the ground, but the umpire thought otherwise and ruled him out. Johnson had little else to do as the pacemen made steady progress on a seaming pitch. He bowled only two overs for three runs as England fell for 186, handing Australia victory by 409 runs and a 2–0 series lead.\nThe next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Test. Johnson was rested as Australia completed a ten-wicket win.\nJohnson returned for the following match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test. Australia batted first and reached 7/774 declared, its highest score of the tour, which underpinned a victory by an innings and 363 runs. Johnson made 27, after coming in at 6/669 and playing a supporting role in a 105-run partnership with Sam Loxton, who made 159 not out. Acting captain Hassett declared without further addition to the score after Johnson fell at 7/774. Johnson played a leading role with the ball, taking his only ten-wicket match haul for the tour. After the hosts' openers had put on 74, Johnson removed both in quick succession to leave Gloucestershire at 2/79. He later took the last three wickets as Gloucestershire collapsed from 6/257 to be all out for 269. Johnson had totalled 6/68 from 31.4 overs. Hassett elected to enforce the follow on and the home side reached 2/72 before Johnson took five of the last eight wickets to help end the innings for 132. Johnson ended with 5/32 from 17.1 overs for a match total of 11/100. Johnson took his 50th wicket for the tour during the fixture and was on 57 by the end of the game, the 18th of 31 first-class matches on the tour.\nThird Test.\nThe teams reassembled at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped Bill Brown, their reserve opener, who had batted out of position in the middle order and scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings. Brown was replaced by the all rounder Sam Loxton; the move had an unexpected impact on Johnson's playing role during the Test.\nYardley won the toss and elected to bat. England consolidated their innings after falling to 2/28. The hosts were content to score slowly and regroup, and Johnson's first ten overs before lunch yielded only seven runs. However, when Johnson was bowling his second spell after lunch, Jack Crapp hit three driven boundaries in quick succession. Crapp was eager to use his feet to get to the pitch of Johnson's deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. Crapp's counter-attack prompted Bradman to take the second new ball and remove Johnson with the score at 2/96. England then lost three quick wickets to the pacemen to be 5/119. Soon after, Yardley lofted Ernie Toshack—who was bowling leg theory—into the on-side and Johnson caught him for 22 at forward square leg to leave England at 6/141. Soon after, Compton, the last of the specialist batsmen, nearly departed when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, the benefit of the doubt was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected.\nOn the second morning, English tail-ender Dick Pollard came to the crease and pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Australian opener Sid Barnes, who was standing at short leg. Barnes stood closer than most in this position—almost on the edge of the cut strip—and was unable to evade the ball. He \"dropped like a fallen tree\", and had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination. England eventually reached 363 after Johnson had sent down 38 overs and conceded 77 runs without success. With Barnes injured and Brown dropped, Arthur Morris was the only opener available, so Johnson was deployed as his makeshift partner. He had never opened at Test level, but had once batted at No. 3 when used as a nightwatchman after the fall of the first wicket late on a day's play. Journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O’Reilly criticised the use of Johnson as an opener, as vice-captain Lindsay Hassett had transformed himself into a defensive batsman with little backlift and a guarded approach, traits that were typical of an opener. Johnson made only one, exposing Bradman to the new ball. Although Australia struggled, they eventually avoided the follow on and ended on 221.\nEngland came out for their second innings, and with Bradman predominantly reliant on his seamers, Johnson bowled only seven overs on the third afternoon as the hosts closed at 3/174 from 69 overs. Late in the day, Johnson dropped Washbrook in the slips cordon from the bowling of Toshack when the batsman was on 80. Washbrook reached stumps unbeaten on 85, and Johnson's miss only cost five runs, as the fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day. Johnson ended with 0/16 from seven overs.\nPlay began after the tea break, and Australia needed to score 317 in the last session if they wanted victory. The pitch played very slowly due to the excess moisture, which meant the ball slowed significantly upon hitting the ground surface. As Australia were not looking to chase the runs, there was no need for run-saving fieldsmen, so Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. In the first half-hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Jack Young replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp and falling for six to leave Australia at 1/10. Australia batted for another two hours without further loss, to reach 1/92 from 61 overs before the match was finally ended after a series of periodic rain interruptions. Johnson had an unhappy game, scoring only seven runs in two innings, dropping a catch and taking match figures of 0/93.\nAfter the Test, Johnson was rested for Australia's victory over Middlesex by ten wickets; it was their only county match between Tests.\nFourth Test.\nThe teams headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test with Barnes still unfit. Australia made two changes for the Test. Middle-order batsman Neil Harvey came in for Barnes, while Ron Saggers replaced Don Tallon—who had a finger injury—behind the stumps. Brown was not recalled to open with Morris; instead, Hassett was promoted from the middle-order to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. Australia thus jettisoned the experiment of opening the batting with Johnson, who had managed only one and six in the previous Test.\nEngland won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch that was predicted to be unhelpful for fast bowling. Thirty minutes before tea, England brought up their 150 without loss, and continued unhindered after two brief interruptions due to rain. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate. Bradman brought on Johnson, who had delivered only three overs so far, the rest of the proceedings having been through fast bowlers. Seeking to stem the flow of runs, Bradman gave Johnson a ring field with no slip. Johnson bowled two consecutive maidens, but Washbrook was scoring freely at the other end, so Bradman called for the new ball and brought back the fast bowlers. Johnson was still wicketless when England closed the day at 2/268. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton accused Australia of going \"progressively downhill\" and regarded their performance as their worst day of bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses.\nThe next morning, England progressed strongly. Nightwatchman Alec Bedser hit three consecutive fours from Toshack, prompting Bradman to replace him with Johnson. Bedser surveyed Johnson's wares for one over before hitting him into the leg side three times in the next, yielding a six and two fours. Bradman responded by removing Johnson from the attack. When the off spinner came back, Edrich hit him for another six to reach 96. However, Johnson soon had his revenge. England reached 2/423 when Bedser was out caught and bowled by Johnson, patting the ball back to the bowler when he could have hit it decisively. His on-drive was intercepted by the bowler, who dived across the pitch to his right-hand side to complete the catch. This ended a 155-run third-wicket partnership. Edrich attempted to pull a Johnson long hop to the leg side, targeting the large gap between square leg and mid-on, but only ballooned the ball to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on. This came only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 4/426. Johnson's two wickets brought two new batsmen were to the crease and precipitated a collapse that saw England dismissed for 496. Johnson ended with 2/89 from 33 overs and was the least economical of the frontline bowlers except Toshack, who broke down with a knee injury.\nOn the third afternoon, Johnson came to the crease at 5/294 in Australia's first innings when Harvey departed for 112, but he made only 10 before falling at 6/329. Lindwall replaced him and made 77 as Australia's tail pushed the score to 458 on the fourth morning, reducing the deficit to 38. In the second innings, the English batsmen continued to attack Johnson. Given Johnson's lack of economy in the first innings, Bradman declined to use him for the entirety of the first session of the fourth day. When Johnson was introduced after lunch, he was targeted, and Washbrook and Hutton both lofted him for sixes in quick succession, prompting Bradman to remove him from the attack. When Johnson returned, Hutton again hit him in the air, but this time Bradman took a running catch to dismiss the batsman for 57, leaving England at 2/129. Edrich and Compton came in and were initially pinned down, but after 45 minutes, Compton charged Johnson and heaved a delivery to the leg side for a boundary. Bradman promptly took the new ball as England reached 2/209 at tea. After the break, England continued to target Johnson. Edrich hit Johnson for three consecutive fours before lofting a fourth into the crowd for six. Compton took risks against Johnson, successfully cutting against the spin several times, and Bradman was forced to use a well-spread field to cut down the fast scoring off Johnson. England reached 2/232 before collapsing to be 8/362 at the end of the day, but Johnson was not responsible for any of these wickets.\nEngland batted on for five minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 8/365. Johnson ended with 1/85 from 21 overs and was the most uneconomical of the Australian bowlers, conceding runs at a rate of 4.04 per over while the others averaged 3.26. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket, make it more likely to spin and therefore more difficult for Australia to bat on.\nThis left Australia a target of 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever run-chase to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, but they scored the runs with 15 minutes to spare and seven wickets in hand, sealing the series 3–0.\nAfter bowling 54 overs at Headingley, Johnson was rested as Australia defeated Derbyshire by an innings in a match that started the day after the Fourth Test. He bowled the most overs upon his return in the following match against Glamorgan, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Johnson sent down 28.4 overs and took 3/58 as the hosts were bowled out for 197; Australia reached 3/215 when the weather ended the match.\nJohnson was the most economical Australian in the first innings of the game against Warwickshire. He took 3/29 from 22.3 overs as the hosts fell for 138, before making an unbeaten 13 at No. 9 as Australia struggled to 254 in reply. He was given a solitary maiden over in the second innings before Australia won by nine wickets. Australia then faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. Johnson came to the crease at 6/202 after Bradman's men had suffered a middle-order collapse of 3/8. He made 48 as the Australian lower order wagged to push the score to 321. Johnson was given a light bowling load in the first innings, sending down only five overs, but he removed three of the last four wickets to end with 3/5 as the hosts fell for 130. He did not bat in the second innings and took 1/30 as the home side managed to hang on with seven wickets down. In the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings, Johnson came in at 7/212 and made 44 to help Australia recover to 282 and took 1/2 from three overs as the hosts reached 5/73 when rain ended the match after the first day.\nFifth Test.\nAustralia travelled to The Oval for the Fifth Test. After taking only seven wickets at 61.00 in the four Tests, and being severely attacked in the previous match at Headingley, Johnson was dropped in favour of leg spinner Doug Ring. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. England were dismissed for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon with Ring not required to bowl, as the pacemen made light work of the hosts. Ring was economical in the second innings, taking 1/44 from 28 overs as Australia sealed the series 4–0 with another innings victory.\nLater tour matches.\nSeven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Johnson returned and made 15 of 361 as Australia batted first against Kent. Johnson was not asked to bowl as the first four bowlers used cut down the hosts' first innings for 51 in just 23 overs. It was a similar tale in the second innings after Australia enforced the follow on. The pacemen did the early damage and Johnson bowled only briefly, sending down 4.5 overs and removing the last two batsmen to end with 2/15 as the hosts fell for 124 in 32.5 overs to seal another Australian victory by an innings in two days. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, Johnson did not bat before Australia declared at 5/610 against a team featuring eight Test players. When the tourists bowled, Johnson took three consecutive wickets to reduce the hosts from 1/76 to 4/121. He ended with 4/60 from 23 overs as the Gentlemen made 245. Johnson's victims included Donnelly, future England opener Reg Simpson and former England captain Walter Robins. Bradman enforced the follow on, and Johnson took the last three wickets to end with 3/69 from 28.5 overs, including the scalps of Robins and Test player Freddie Brown. This completed another innings victory for the tourists. Johnson broke through for his first century of the tour in the next match against Somerset. Australia batted first and Johnson came in at No. 6 with the score at 4/306 to join Ron Hamence, who was also looking for his first ton of the season. The pair put on 195 runs, before Hamence fell at the closest possible point to his century, stumped for 99. Miller came out and helped Johnson add another 59 before Australia declared at 5/560, with the latter undefeated on 113. Following his innings, Johnson only bowled 10 overs in taking 1/19 for the match. The hosts were bowled out twice for a combined total of 186 from a sum of just 81.3 overs as Australia enforced the follow on and won by an innings and 374 runs. Johnson was rested for the fixture against the South of England. Australia declared at 7/522 and bowled out the hosts for 298 when rain ended the match.\nAustralia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current Test players be allowed to play for the hosts. After his opponents complied with the demand, Bradman fielded a full-strength team, the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Johnson's return at the expense of Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177 and Johnson took 3/45, his victims being Donnelly, Yardley and former Test batsman Laurie Fishlock. Johnson also caught Brown and Laker from the bowling of Lindwall. Johnson made 38 as Australia declared at 8/469 in reply. The hosts were 2/75 in their second innings when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. Johnson took both wickets,—the batsman being Hutton and Fishlock—ending with 2/12.\nThe tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Johnson made a duck in Australia's first innings of 236 in the first match. He then bowled a total of 17 overs and took 3/26 as Australia won by an innings. In the second match, Johnson took 3/26 from 20.2 overs in the first innings as Scotland made 178. He was promoted to No. 5 and came in at 3/96 to hit 95 as Australia reached 6/407 declared. In the second innings, Johnson was unable to add a wicket in his final opportunity for the tour, taking 0/6 from three overs. However, when it became clear Australia was in an unassailable position, Bradman allowed wicket-keeper Don Tallon to bowl, and he took 2/15. In the meantime, Johnson deputised with the gloves and he completed a stumping from the leg spin of Ring as Australia finished the tour with another innings victory.\nRole.\nAn off spinner, Johnson was a member of Bradman's first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final rubber. He also played in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and Leveson-Gower's XI, where Australia selected their strongest possible team. However, Johnson was not prominent in the Test success, taking seven wickets at 61.00, his best result being 3/72 in the first innings of the Second Test. Among the five frontline bowlers used in four or more Tests, Lindwall, Miller, Toshack, Johnston and Johnson, the last had the worst average by a factor of almost two; Toshack averaged 33.09 and the others less than 23.50. Lindwall and Johnston took 27 wickets each, while Miller and Toshack took 13 and 11 respectively. Johnson's economy rate was the second worst of the quintet and his strike rate of 156.86 was more than twice as bad as the others, with the exception of Toshack (94.46). Johnson also had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at 10.20, but he did take five catches in the slips.\nJohnson had more success in the tour matches, taking 85 wickets at 18.37 in all first-class matches. This placed him third in the wicket-taking and fifth in the averages among the Australians. In the first-class matches excluding the Tests, Johnson was the leading wicket-taker. He bowled more overs than anyone but Johnston, allowing Bradman to ease the workload on his pace spearheads Lindwall and Miller, allowing them to conserve energy ahead of the Tests. Johnson's most successful game with the ball was against Gloucestershire, which yielded match figures of 11/100. Like his bowling, Johnson's batting was also more successful outside of the Tests, scoring 543 runs at 30.16 in 22 innings, with a top-score of 113 not out against Somerset and an 80 against a MCC team that consisted almost entirely of Test players. Johnson usually batted at No. 7 or No. 8, although he was notably used as a makeshift opener in the Third Test and scored an aggressive 74 at No. 3 in the run-chase against Hampshire.N- Johnson was prominent in the field, taking 23 catches, the most by a non-wicket-keeper on tour. He usually fielded in the slips.\n\"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" noted that while Johnson had started the tour well, he was not as effective in English conditions as on his home pitches in Australia. \nNotes.\nStatistical note.\nn-[1]\nThis statement can be verified by consulting all of the scorecards for the matches, as listed here."

        "title": "Sam Loxton with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Sam Loxton was a member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948. Bradman's men went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\".\nA batting all rounder, Loxton played as a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast medium bowler who reinforced the frontline pace attack of Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and Bill Johnston. Starting the tour as a fringe player, Loxton was omitted for the pre-Test fixtures against Worcestershire and the Marylebone Cricket Club, where Australia traditionally fielded their full-strength team. He was overlooked for the first two Tests; reserve opening batsman Bill Brown played out of position in the middle-order. However, Brown struggled in the unfamiliar role, and Loxton scored 159 not out against Gloucestershire to oust the former from his position for the Third Test at Old Trafford. Loxton scored 36 to help Australia avoid the follow on and salvage a draw, before making his most notable contribution in the Fourth Test at Headingley. He took 3/55 in the first innings and scored a counter-attacking 93 on the third day to keep Australia in the game; they went on to win after a world record-breaking run-chase on the final day. Loxton also played in the Fifth Test and ended the series with 144 runs at a batting average of 48.00 and three wickets at a bowling average of 49.33.\nIn the tour matches, Loxton sometimes opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller to save their energy for the Tests, and he occasionally batted above the middle-order. Loxton was the most economical, but the least incisive of the bowlers, and he never took more than three wickets in an innings. He played 22 first-class matches and scored 973 runs at 57.23 with three centuries, and took 32 wickets at 21.71. He was eighth in the run-scoring aggregates, but was productive when given an opportunity, ranking fifth in the Australian averages. Loxton was the eighth-leading wicket-taker; all seven frontline bowlers ahead of him took at least 50 wickets. Noted for his energetic and combative approach, Loxton was twice forced out of action for his troubles; he pulled a groin while searching for extra pace with the ball early in the tour, and towards the end of the season, he hit a ball into his face and broke his nose.\nBackground.\nAfter serving in World War II, Loxton was demobilised and rose through the cricketing ranks to make his first-class debut in 1946–47. He was an all rounder—a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. During the 1947–48 Australian season, India toured Australia for five Tests, and the home team dominated, taking an unassailable 3–0 series lead after the first four matches. The Australian selectors then decided to use the Fifth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to give opportunities to players on the fringes of the national team to show their capabilities ahead of the 1948 tour of England. Loxton was one of several debutants, and he seized his chance. He scored 80 and took three wickets as an all rounder in the Australian victory, and was rewarded with inclusion in the 17-man touring party.\nEarly tour.\nAustralia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was usually against Worcestershire. Bradman and his co-selectors felt that Loxton was not among the 11 strongest players, so he was not selected against Worcestershire. Loxton's debut had come about because first-choice opener Arthur Morris had been rested from the Fifth Test so that the selectors could trial potential players for the 1948 tour. Sid Barnes had opened in that match with Bill Brown. Morris and Barnes were Bradman's preferred pair and they opened against Worcestershire, while Brown, who was on his third tour of England, was played out of position in the middle-order, pushing Loxton out of the team. Loxton looked on as Brown made 25 and Australia won by an innings.\nIn the next match against Leicestershire, Loxton was given his first chance on English soil. Batting at No. 7, he managed only four before being trapped leg before wicket by Australian expatriate left arm orthodox spinner Vic Jackson, as Australia amassed 448. He then opened the bowling and castled home captain Les Berry for one to leave the hosts at 1/1 and take his first wicket on English soil. He also took two catches, both from the bowling of fellow Victorian Doug Ring as the hosts fell for 130. Loxton again opened the bowling in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and dismissed the hosts for 147 to seal another innings win. Loxton took 1/11 and 0/12 from six and seven overs respectively.\nThe Australians then proceeded to play Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Loxton bowled only one over, which was a maiden, before pulling his groin while trying to attain more pace, as the hosts were bowled out for 71. He was unable to bat or bowl again in the game as Australia replied with 101 and then removed the hosts for 89 to leave themselves a target of 60 for victory. Australia came closest to losing for the whole tour. They fell to 6/31, effectively seven down with Loxton unable to bat, before scraping home without further loss, although both batsmen at the crease survived chances. Due to his injury, Loxton was rested for the next two matches against Surrey at The Oval in London and Cambridge University. Australia won both matches by an innings.\nIn the following match against Essex, Loxton returned as Australia won the toss, batted first and went on to score a world record of 721 first-class runs in one day's play. Loxton came in at 4/452 and put on 56 with Ron Hamence and 166 with Ron Saggers in 65 minutes before falling at 6/664 for 120. Loxton's innings was noted for its hooking and driving and took around 80 minutes. During the innings, Loxton also passed 1,000 first-class career runs. Australia collapsed after Loxton's departure, losing their last five wickets for 57 late on the first day.\nAustralia then proceeded to victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the tour. Loxton was not required to bowl in the first innings as the hosts fell for 83 in 36.5 overs. In the second innings, Loxton was given the new ball and bowled 12 overs without success, conceding 28 runs before Essex were all out for 187.\nIn the next match against Oxford University, Loxton came in at 4/206 and anchored the innings, remaining unbeaten on 79 as Australia were bowled out for 431. He featured in partnerships with Colin McCool and Doug Ring, who both made fifties. He then took the new ball in both innings, taking 1/14 and 1/16 from five and eight overs respectively in another innings victory. When Oxford batted, Philip Whitcombe struck a delivery from Ernie Toshack to Loxton, and took a few steps out of his crease. Loxton prepared to throw at the Whitcombe's stumps in a run out attempt, but did not release, while Whitcombe stood his ground outside the crease. In those days, the fielding standards were lower, with weaker and less accurate throws and Whitcombe was only a metre or two outside his crease, while Loxton was around thirty away. The next delivery from Toshack was again hit to Loxton, and Whitcombe again wandered outside his crease. This time Loxton threw the ball and hit the stumps directly, running out the batsman, who was unable to comprehend what had happened and shook his head.\nThe next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance for all players to gain a psychological advantage over their opponents for the Tests.\nLoxton had scored 203 runs in three innings at an average of 101.50, but was not selected, nor was middle-order batsman Harvey, who had scored a century in the previous Test against India. Harvey struggled to adapt to English conditions at the start of his first tour and made only 83 runs at 16.60 in five innings on tour. Brown, who had scored 527 runs at 75.28 for the season so far, including three centuries in his last three innings, was played out of position in the middle-order, even though he had batted as an opener in every tour match other than against Worcestershire. Due to the rotation policy in the tour matches, only two of the three openers Brown, Morris and Barnes played in any one game while the other rested, except when Bradman tried to fit all three in a full-strength team by having Brown in the middle-order. The team was exactly the same as for the opening fixture against Worcestershire.\nBarring one change in the bowling department, the same team went on to be selected for the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. Brown made only 26 as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings.\nThe MCC match was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. Loxton top-scored with 39 as Australia batted first and were bowled out for 204 after the first day was washed out. He then took 0/18 from eight overs and made 52 in the second innings before being run out while batting with Harvey as the match ended in a draw. In the second innings, Loxton attempted to attack the bowling of Malcolm Hilton—who had troubled Bradman in the first innings—in an attempt to throw him off his game. However, Hilton had the last laugh and removed Bradman for the second time.\nIn the following match against Nottinghamshire, Loxton took a total of 0/21 from 12 overs and was run out for 16 as Australia played out another draw. In the next fixture against Hampshire, Australia had another scare. On a drying pitch, Loxton took 1/2, ending the resistance of top-scorer John Arnold for 48 as Australia removed the hosts for 195. He then made a duck as Australia suffered a middle-order collapse and were dismissed for 117. It was the first time that Bradman's men had conceded a first innings lead during the campaign. Loxton then took 0/6 from five overs as Hampshire were bowled out for 103 to leave Australia a victory target of 182 in 175 minutes. He was not required as Australia's top-order batted steadily to take an eight-wicket win. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex. Loxton opened the bowling and took 3/13 from 10 overs as the hosts fell for 86 in 46.4 overs. Australia then declared at 5/549 before he could bat. Loxton was not asked to bowl as Sussex were out for 138 to seal another innings victory. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Sussex's display was \"as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew\".\nFirst Test.\nUp to this point, Brown had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72.72, while Loxton had made 310 runs at 51.66. Harvey had scored only 296 runs at 42.29. The other five places in the top six were firmly entrenched in the hands of Barnes, Morris, Bradman, Hassett and Miller, who had all played in those positions regularly since the end of World War II. Brown gained selection out of position in the middle order in the First Test at Trent Bridge, while Loxton and Harvey watched from the sidelines. There was a chance one of them would receive a last-minute call-up as Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week leading up to the Test, but the opener recovered. Brown made only 17 as Australia won by eight wickets.\nBetween Tests, Loxton played in the match against Northamptonshire, which started the day after Trent Bridge. With pace spearhead Ray Lindwall injured and Keith Miller rested following a marathon effort in the opening Test, Loxton opened the bowling and took 2/22 from 15 overs the hosts were dismissed for 119. He made only 17 with the bat and took 0/7, again opening in the second innings as Australia cruised to victory by an innings. Loxton was rested for the second match before the Second Test, against Yorkshire; Brown scored a century in a drawn match.\nSecond Test.\nAustralia opted to field an unchanged line-up for the Second Test at Lord's. Brown managed only 24 and 32 in the middle order as Australia won by 409 runs. Including the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC, he had totalled 123 runs at 24.60 in his five innings in the middle-order. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who was noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that although Brown had made an unbeaten double century on his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Loxton and Harvey had better claims to selection.\nThe next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Test. Bradman wanted to allow his leading players a lighter workload after their effort at Lord's, and Miller had an unauthorised night of partying and did not return to the team hotel until dawn, so Loxton opened the bowling, and he took two quick wickets to leave the hosts at 2/14. Loxton ended with 2/37 from 25 overs, sending down the most deliveries among the Australians, as the hosts were all out for 221. He made eight with the bat and again opened the bowling in the second innings, taking 1/53 from 18 overs. Australia needed 122 in the final innings to win, and Loxton and Harvey were promoted after the latter offered to open. Bradman's men wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch the Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon final. Harvey and Loxton, who were roommates during the tour, made the runs in only 58 minutes in 20.1 overs, with Loxton unbeaten on 47, to complete a 10-wicket win.\nThe following match against Gloucestershire at Bristol was the last before the Third Test and Loxton's final chance to push his claims for Test duties. Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest score of the tour, laying the foundation for a victory by an innings and 363 runs. Loxton came in at 4/466 and put on 63 with Harvey, before his fellow Victorian was out for 95. He then added 104 with Colin McCool and 105 with Ian Johnson. Loxton was on 159 when Johnson lost his wicket, which prompted acting captain Lindsay Hassett to declare the innings closed. Loxton's innings involved a series of powerful strokes that went for six and he was particularly noted for using his feet to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard. The Gloucestershire bowler had been touted as a possible Test selection, because the other England bowlers had failed to contain Australia's batsman in the first two matches, but his chances of selection were ended with the tourists' assault at Bristol. Immediately after the declaration, Loxton opened the bowling and ended with 1/22 from as Gloucestershire were all out for 269. Hassett enforced the follow on and Loxton again started proceedings with the ball, but only for two overs. The home side were bowled out for 132 to complete another Australian victory.\nThird Test.\nAustralia and England reassembled at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Following his unbeaten 159 in the previous match and Brown's struggles when playing in the middle-order, Loxton took Brown's position. Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 in the middle-order in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests. As fast bowling all rounder Keith Miller had been struggling with a back injury that prevented him from bowling from time to time, Loxton was seen as a necessary reinforcement for the frontline bowlers. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and Loxton bowled first change, sending down seven overs for the loss of 18 runs. The Australians themselves opened with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and needed to swap his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over, his first in Ashes cricket. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant George Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass.\nOn the second morning, English tailender Alec Bedser had reached 37. His partner Denis Compton hit a ball into the covers and Bradman and Loxton collided in an attempt to field the ball and prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end. Bedser was a long way short of the crease and was run out. The wicket ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 in a 121-run partnership. England then lost their last three wickets for 26 runs to be all out for 363.\nOn the third day, Loxton and wicket-keeper Don Tallon both came to the crease with Australia in difficulty at 5/139. Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before the gloveman was caught behind from Bill Edrich. Lindwall came to the crease to join Loxton at 6/172 as Australia faced the prospect of being forced to follow on. The pair added a further 36 before Loxton was bowled by Dick Pollard, leaving Australia 7/208, still five runs behind the follow on mark, which they scraped past to end with 221. Loxton again bowled first change in the second innings, taking 0/29 from eight overs as England reached 3/174 at the end of the third day. Loxton narrowly missed out on a catch when opener Cyril Washbrook had appeared unsettled by some short-pitched bowling from the Australians. A few uncontrolled hook shots flew in the air, and one of these barely evaded Loxton at fine leg. The fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day. Play began after the tea break, and Australia needed to score 317 in the last session, while England required ten wickets for victory. Loxton did not bat as Australia reached 1/92 from 61 overs when the match was finally ended by a series of periodic rain interruptions.\nAfter the Test, Loxton bowled first change in the first innings against Middlesex. He took 3/33 from 21 overs as the hosts were bowled out for 203. Loxton removed Leslie Compton, his younger brother and England Test batsman Denis, and Jim Sims in the space of five runs to reduce Middlesex from 5/182 to 8/188. He had a heavier workload than normal in the first innings, as leading paceman Lindwall had turned up inebriated on the first morning and therefore lacked energy and penetration. Loxton then joined Morris at the crease, with Australia in difficulty at 3/53. They put on 172 in 115 minutes before Morris was out for 109, and Loxton followed him at 5/271 for the top-score of 123, having punished the bowlers in a hard-hitting display. Australia then collapsed to be all out for 317. Loxton took 1/15 in the second innings to help seal victory by ten wickets in Australia's only county match before the Fourth Test.\nFourth Test.\nThe teams headed to Headingley in Leeds for the Fourth Test. Harvey came in for the injured Barnes, joining Loxton in the middle-order. Brown was not recalled to join Morris at the top of the order; instead, Hassett was promoted as a makeshift opener.\nEngland won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch that was expected to be unhelpful for fast bowling. Opener Len Hutton was dropped by Hassett on 25, after flicking the ball behind square leg from Loxton's bowling. This proved to be costly, as Hutton reached 81 before falling at 1/168. England were 2/268 at the end of the first day. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Australia's day went \"progressively downhill\" and said that it was the country's worst day of bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses.\nOn the second morning, the nightwatchman Alec Bedser was attacking Australia. He took 14 from one Ernie Toshack over, before taking another 14 from an Ian Johnson over soon after to reach 47. Loxton was brought on and Bedser hit a ball back near his grasp, but it narrowly evaded him. Bedser reached 79 and England 2/423 when he finally fell, triggering a collapse. At 6/486, Loxton bowled Ken Cranston for 10 to take his first Ashes wicket. Cranston opted to not play at a ball that went straight into his leg stump. Loxton then removed Godfrey Evans and Jim Laker in quick succession as England fell to 496/9. Evans fell meekly, prodding a ball straight to Hassett at silly mid-on, prompting O'Reilly to say that Loxton was \"lucky to be on deck when the English tail were falling over themselves in their nervous speed to commit hara-kiri\". In contrast, Laker edged Loxton down the leg side and it took a diving, low catch from Saggers to complete the dismissal. Umpire Baldwin asked his colleague Chester at square leg to confirm that the ball had carried on the full before sending Laker back to the pavilion. Miller then took the final wicket without further addition to the score. Loxton ended with 3/55 from 26 overs, the second best economy rate among the Australians.\nOn the third morning, Loxton came to the crease to join Harvey with the score at 4/189. Australia had been in trouble after losing two quick wickets to be 3/68, but Miller and Harvey counterattacked, adding 121 runs in 90 minutes, their batting likened by \"Wisden\" to a \"hurricane\". Fingleton said that he had never \"known a more enjoyable hour\" of \"delectable cricket\". Harvey was unperturbed by Miller's departure, hitting 11 from three consecutive balls. Australia went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.\nAfter lunch, Australia scored slowly as Loxton struggled to come to grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester's actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.\nHarvey's departure at 5/294 meant that the first of the bowlers, Johnson, entered the ground. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting him into the crowd for four more sixes. Loxton hit two over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery. Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 6/329. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93. Loxton appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Lindwall then made 77 to propel Australia to 458 on the fourth day, just 38 runs in arrears.\nIn the second innings, Loxton took 0/29 from ten overs, and England batted on for five minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller. This would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin, therefore making life more difficult for Australia's batsmen.\nYardley's declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, but they completed their task with 15 minutes to spare and seven wickets in hand to seal the series 3–0, with Loxton not required to bat.\nAfter the Headingley Test, Loxton came in at 5/344 and made an attacking 51 as Australia batted first and made 456 against Derbyshire. He then took 1/27 from 17.4 overs in the first innings. Australia enforced the follow on and Loxton took the first wicket before returning to take two tail-end wickets and end with 3/16 from 13.4 overs as Australia won by an innings. Loxton was the most economical of the Australian wicket-takers. After six consecutive matches, Loxton was rested for the rain-affected draw against Glamorgan, which did not reach the second innings. The hosts were bowled out for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.\nLoxton returned in the next match and claimed both openers to end with 2/27 from 19 overs as Warwickshire were bowled out for 138 in their first innings. He then made a duck as Australia struggled to 254 in reply. Loxton bowled six overs and took 0/15 in the second innings before Australia won by nine wickets. Australia then faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. Loxton did little, scoring two in his only innings and taking a match total of 1/32, his victim being Test batsman Jack Ikin. In the non-first-class game against Durham, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings, Loxton made 15 in Australia's 282 and then took 1/8 from six overs as the hosts reached 5/73 before rain washed out the match after the first day.\nFifth Test.\nAustralia then headed to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. England were dismissed for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon; Loxton bowled only two overs for one run as the frontline pacemen made light work of the hosts. His other notable action in the field occurred when Len Hutton the first runs of the match, a single in the first over. This had almost turned into a five when Loxton fired in a wide return, but Barnes managed to prevent from going for four overthrows. Loxton came in on the second day with the score at 5/265 and accompanied the centurion Morris for 39 further runs before Edrich had him caught behind for 15. He appeared uncomfortable with the outswingers and leg cutters of Bedser, and was beaten several times, before Edrich dismissed him. Australia ended at 389. Loxton was economical in the second innings, taking 0/16 from 10 overs as Australia dismissed the hosts for 188 to seal the series 4–0 with another innings victory.\nLater tour matches.\nSeven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Loxton made 16 of 361 as Australia batted first against Kent. He came on late in the first innings and took three of the last four wickets as the hosts fell for 51 in just 23 overs. Loxton bowled all his victims as the hosts fell from 5/48 to 51 all out. It was a similar tale in the second innings, as Loxton removed opener Jack Davies for a duck and ended with 1/12 from six overs as the hosts fell for 124 in only 32.5 overs. Australia had won the match by an innings within two days. In the next fixture against the Gentlemen of England, Loxton made only 17 as Australia eventually declared at 5/610 against a team that featured eight Test players. Loxton then took a match total of 0/37 from 21 overs as Australia completed another innings victory. Loxton was rested for the next match against Somerset, which the tourists won by an innings. Loxton then returned against the South of England. He came in at 5/427 and struck an unbeaten 67 in 75 minutes, before Australia declared at 7/522. He took 1/17 from 11 overs, removing Charlie Barnett as the hosts were bowled out for 298 in their first innings when rain ended the match.\nAustralia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson at the expense of Doug Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, with Loxton taking 0/12. Loxton came in at 2/327 and made 12, before sweeping a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face and breaking his nose. He retired hurt and took no further part in the match. Australia declared at 8/469 and the hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.\nThe tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Following his injury, Loxton played in neither; Australia won both by an innings. While in Scotland, Loxton's nose was operated on in Edinburgh. Following his injury, Loxton eschewed the sweep shot and advised students to do the same, exhorting them to move onto the front foot to drive instead.\nRole.\nA batting all-rounder, Loxton played as a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast medium bowler who reinforced the frontline pace attack of Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston. When fit, the trio all bowled before Loxton in the Tests. With medium pacer Ernie Toshack and off spinner Ian Johnson also playing in the Third and Fourth Tests, Loxton was the sixth bowler. In the Fifth Test, Johnson was replaced by leg spinner Ring and the injured Toshack was replaced by a batsman, so Loxton became the fifth bowler. Of the seven regular bowlers, Loxton was the only one who was not a frontline bowler, and as such he had the worst average, the second-worst economy rate and the third-worst strike rate. Loxton ended the Test series with 144 runs at 48.00 and three wickets at 49.33, having bowled 63 overs. Loxton batted at No. 6 or No. 7 during the Tests, and was the last batsman in the batting order before the wicket-keeper and the bowlers.\nIn the tour matches, Loxton sometimes opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller in order to conserve their energy for the Tests, such as in both innings of the match against Northamptonshire and the second match against Surrey. In his 22 first-class innings, he batted twice at No. 4 and opened in one innings, but he was otherwise invariably in the middle-order between No. 5 and No. 7.N- Loxton was the most economical of those who bowled more than 70 overs, but also the least incisive, taking a wicket every 67.75 balls, and he never took more than three wickets in an innings, which he managed on three occasions. He played 22 first-class matches and scored 973 runs at 57.23 with three centuries and took 32 wickets at 21.71. Loxton was eighth in the run-scoring aggregates, but was given less opportunities than the other frontline batsmen who scored more heavily; whereas he had 22 innings, they all had at least 26 innings and tended to bat higher in the order. However, Loxton was productive when given a chance, ranking fifth in the averages. Loxton was the eighth-leading wicket-taker; all seven ahead of him took at least 50 wickets.\n\"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" summed up his contribution thus: \nNotes.\nStatistical note.\nn-[1]\nThis statement can be verified by consulting all the scorecards for the matches, as listed here."

Its kit colours are white, claret and green If the claret dates to two years or more later it may be a nod to Thames Ironworks F.C. If adopted later, the order is the same and top colour only a slight shade different from the suffragette flag, devised in 1908 and widely seen until the 1920s.\nEthos.\nUntil 1956, the club was one of the leading and few London members of the National Amateur Rowing Association and helped to bring about the gradual merger with the Amateur Rowing Association for people in 'non-physical' work, to which were affiliated the various clubs on the Putney Embankment. The club continues to stand firmly against social barriers and has inducted and enhanced the fitness and technical ability of rowers including international-standard oarsmen since the 1960s. The club's leaders over decades of the 20th century won its successful campaign with Poplar Blackwall and District Rowing Club and other NARA clubs – most of which were from the industrial heartlands of Britain – for non-exclusivity in rowing events and national teams, as evidenced in \"Rowing in England: A Social History\". These two clubs in London thus have the strongest record of openness and widening of participation. GB Rowing now has many leading athletes who are not alumni of the old, well-endowed schools and universities which set up the earliest competitions in the sport.\nTraining.\nThames Tradesmen compete in the Head of the River Race and its three offshoots for smaller boats than eights each year. The club organizes a training camp each year before Henley Royal Regatta. During the Summer Season, TTRC is prominent on the regatta circuit and look to peak at Henley and The National Championships.\nSetting.\nAlongside Barnes Bridge Ladies Rowing Club, the club is the closest club to Barnes, much of Chiswick, Acton, the London Borough of Brent and Roehampton. Its size and dedicated long slipway make it attractive to schools and in subscription price for central, west, north-west and south-west London. Its coaching/coxes rooms and broad boat bays are in a very large two-storey building. The upstairs is a shared clubroom and ten changing rooms sponsored by the local London borough divided up at weekends with two clubs sharing the rugby and football fields adjoining.\nIts clubroom and shared lounge is large and overlooks most of Barnes's ornate riverside buildings."

        "title": "1949 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 1949 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 16th annual midseason exhibition game for Major League Baseball all-stars between the American League (AL) and the National League (NL). The AL continued its early dominance of the Midsummer Classic with an 11–7 win at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, New York City, home field of the NL's Brooklyn Dodgers. The win moved the AL's all-time record in the game to 12–4.\nThe 1949 All-Star Game was the first to have African-Americans in the line-up. Jackie Robinson of the Dodgers started for the NL at second base, while his teammates catcher Roy Campanella and pitcher Don Newcombe also played for the NL. Cleveland Indians' outfielder Larry Doby played the final four innings of the game for the AL.\nDodgers in the game.\nThe Dodgers hosted the game and were well-represented. Pee Wee Reese and Jackie Robinson were starting infielders for the NL. Ralph Branca, Don Newcombe, and Preacher Roe were on the pitching staff, while Roy Campanella and Gil Hodges were reserve position players. All of the Dodgers' representatives, with the exception of Branca, played in the game.\nStarting lineups.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nAmerican League.\n Lou Brissie, p\n Vic Raschi, p\n Virgil Trucks, p\nUmpires.\nThe umpires changed assignments in the middle of the fifth inning – Gore and Hubbard swapped positions, while Barlick left the game, Summers moved behind the plate, and Ballanfant move to third base. This was the first All-Star Game to field a 6-man umpiring crew, although after Barlick's departure the remainder of the game was played without an umpire in right field.\nSynopsis.\nThe starting pitchers were Mel Parnell of the Boston Red Sox for the AL, and Warren Spahn of the Boston Braves for the NL.\nThe AL opened a high scoring game in the top of the 1st inning; with a man on first (who reached on an error) and two outs, a sequence of single-walk-single-error-single pushed across 4 runs. The NL got 2 runs back in the bottom of the inning, with a double from Jackie Robinson followed by a home run by Stan Musial. In the bottom of the 2nd, the NL cut the AL's lead to 4–3; with bases loaded and no outs, Don Newcombe hit a lineout to left field that Willard Marshall scored on, but the NL was unable to score more as the next batter grounded into a double play. The NL then pulled ahead 5–4 by scoring twice in the bottom of the third, on two walks and three singles during the inning.\nThe AL pulled back ahead 6–5 in the top of the 4th inning; with men on second and third with two out, Eddie Joost hit a single to score both runners. The AL's lead was extended to 8–5 in the top of the 6th inning; with runners on first and third with one out, Joe DiMaggio drove in both men with a double. Ralph Kiner of the NL hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the 6th inning, which cut the AL lead to 8–7. The AL extended their lead in the top of the 7th inning; with a man on second and two out, a sequence of single-single-double scored three runs. That brought the AL lead to 11–7, and completed the scoring for the game.\nThe game wasn't crisp defensively, as there were six errors, five of them by the NL. All four of the AL's runs in the first inning were unearned.\nDetroit Tigers pitcher Virgil Trucks got the win, and Vic Raschi of the New York Yankees earned a save, while the Brooklyn Dodgers' Don Newcombe took the loss."

        "text": "Chesterfield Bowling Club on Beetwell Street Chesterfield in Derbyshire is believed to date back to 1294. Southampton Old Bowling Green, situated on the corner of Lower Canal Walk and Platform Road, Southampton, England, also claims to be the world's oldest surviving bowling green. It was first used in 1299;\nHistory.\nThe Hospital of \"God's House\" was founded in 1185 for pilgrims who were going either to the shrine of St Swithun at Winchester or to Canterbury; until 2011, the gateway housed the museum of archaeology.\nThe green adjoining the God's House Hospital had been established during the reign of Richard I the Lionheart for the recreational use of the Warden, and was first used for a game of bowls in 1299.\nThe club that plays there now is believed to have been established in the 17th century because of the history of a competition known as the \"Knighthood\". It is also the only club that has a \"Master\" in charge, a title carried forward from the earliest of days.\nBowling Green House, now occupied by Wainwright Bros. (shipping agency) and the Consulate Of The Federal Republic Of Germany, is a Grade II listed building. Built in the mid-19th century, it is a three-storey brick building with a green slate roof with a central cupola on eight Tuscan columns, surmounted by a steep weather-vane.\nThe Knighthood.\nA unique occurrence called the \"Knighthood\" competition is held annually when the members (gentlemen commoners) compete to obtain 7 points, with the winner being awarded the title of \"Knight-of-the-green\" and becoming a sir (in lower case). The competition is adjudicated by the members who have previously won the competition (Knights), who adjudicate in top hats and frocked tails suits. Those who win are excluded from future Knighthood competitions.\nThis is the annual competition of the club with rules which are different from the normal variant of the game.\nThe competition used to start on 1 August but now starts on the third Wednesday of the month and is open to all members of the club, except the pre-existing knights.\nThe game is played \"roving jack\" style in that the jack is placed on a penny anywhere on the green. Each player takes it in turns to bowl his two bowls at the jack. Each bowl when it comes to rest is measured and the distance from the jack is recorded before the bowl is removed. If a bowl moves the jack, the jack is placed back on the penny before it is measured. If the penny is partially covered by the bowl it is a toucher, if totally covered it is a lodger. After all the players have bowled the player with the closest bowl is awarded one point. If he also has the second nearest he scores two. The jack is then reset at a different position and the game continues until somebody has scored seven points.\nThe winner is made a \"knight-of-the-green\" and can never enter this competition again. It is a rarity for the knight to be declared on the first day and the competition has been known to last ten days.\nPast knights.\nAmongst the winners of the competition were the former Burnley and Southampton footballer Tom Nicol, who won the 133rd championship in 1907."

The playoff system was thus expanded from a four-team to an eight-team tournament, and was designed so that four of the new expansion teams would qualify for the postseason.\nThe defending champion Toronto Maple Leafs did not qualify and a new champion would be crowned. The Montreal Canadiens would defeat the St. Louis Blues in four straight to win the Stanley Cup.\nFormat.\nAll of the 'Original Six' teams were placed in the new Eastern Division, and all of the new teams placed in the new Western Division. Each division contributed four playoff teams. Division teams then played off to produce a divisional champion, and the two divisional champions played off in the Final to win the Stanley Cup.\nThe imbalance between the new teams and old was readily apparent in the standings. All four of the East Division teams had a better record than the top team in the West.\nSeries.\nAll series but Bruins-Canadiens had a game postponed after the Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. on April 4.\nQuarterfinals.\n(E1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (E3) Boston Bruins.\nThe Montreal Canadiens were the best regular season team, earning 94 points. The Boston Bruins earned 84 points to finish third in the East Division. This was the thirteenth playoff series between these two rivals, with Montreal winning ten of their twelve previous series. Their most recent series had come in the 1958 Stanley Cup Finals, which Montreal won in six games. These teams split their ten-game regular season series.\nThe Bruins, making their first appearance in the playoffs since 1959, were swept in four games.\n(E2) New York Rangers vs. (E4) Chicago Black Hawks.\nThe New York Rangers earned 90 points to finish second in the East Division. The Chicago Blackhawks finished fourth in the East Division with 80 points. This was the second playoff series between these two teams. Their only previous series came in the 1931 semifinals, where Chicago won the two-game total goals series 3 goals to 0. New York earned eleven of twenty points in this year's regular season series.\nThe Black Hawks, led by Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita upset the Rangers in six to set up a Montreal-Chicago East Division showdown.\n(W1) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (W3) St. Louis Blues.\nThe Philadelphia Flyers were West Division Champions, earning 73 points. The St. Louis Blues earned 70 points to finish third in the West Division. This was the first playoff series for both teams. Philadelphia earned sixteen of twenty points in this year's regular season series.\nPhiladelphia was upset by the Blues, led by goaltender Glenn Hall and coached by future Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman, in seven games.\n(W2) Los Angeles Kings vs. (W4) Minnesota North Stars.\nThe Los Angeles Kings finished second in the West Division with 72 points. The Minnesota North Stars earned 69 points to finish fourth in the West Division. This was the first playoff series for both teams. Minnesota earned fourteen of twenty points in this year's regular season series.\nThe North Stars defeated the Kings in seven games.\nSemifinals.\n(E1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (E4) Chicago Black Hawks.\nThis was the 14th playoff series between these two teams. Their most recent series previous to this one was in the 1965 Stanley Cup Finals, which Montreal won four games to three. Montreal earned fourteen of a possible twenty points from the ten 1967-1968 regular season matchups between the two teams.\nThe Black Hawks could not provide another upset, and lost to the Canadiens in five games, giving Montreal their only defeat of the playoffs.\n(W3) St. Louis Blues vs. (W4) Minnesota North Stars.\nSt. Louis earned twelve of twenty points in this year's regular season series.\nRon Schock's goal in double OT, called the \"Midnight Goal\" by many hockey fans, gave the Blues the series and sent them to the Stanley Cup Finals.\nFinals.\nThe Montreal Canadiens advanced to their fourth consecutive Stanley Cup Finals, having won the championship in 1965 and 1966. The St. Louis Blues beat out the five other teams also playing in their inaugural season to reach the Final.

Afterward, fans wore the sleeve as a fashion statement, and by 2008, the sleeves were the most popular non-apparel items sold by the league. According to an NBA Store spokesperson.\nOther players, including Ray Allen, Vince Carter, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Paul Pierce, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Dwyane Wade, Paul George, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James have worn the sleeves as well.\nIverson continued wearing his basketball sleeve long after his elbow had healed. Some players believe the mild compression they provide helps keep their shooting arm warm and improves circulation. Although some studies show improved circulation and reduced soreness, there has been no definitive study on the use of basketball sleeves."

        "text": "Tom Williams (born December 22, 1969) is an American college football coach and former player. He was most recently the head football coach at Greenhill School from 2013 to 2017. Williams also served as head coach at Yale University from 2009 to 2011, compiling a record of 16–14. He was a linebacker at Stanford University from 1989 to 1992.\nPlaying career.\nWilliams attended Trinity Valley School in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas. During his tenure at Trinity Valley he earned all-state honors in football, basketball, and baseball. Williams graduated from high school in 1988.\nWilliams went on to pursue academics at Stanford University. While pursuing academics, Williams was also a four-year starter and letterman for the Stanford Cardinal. He played linebacker for the Stanford Cardinal from 1989–1992 and served as a team captain his senior year. He was a two-time member of the Academic All-Pac-10 team and an honorable mention for All-Pac-10 his senior season.\nCoaching career.\nWilliams worked as an assistant coach at Stanford University, the University of Hawaii, San Jose State University, and University of Washington before joining the Jacksonville Jaguars as an assistant coach from 2006 to 2008.\nHe accepted an offer, in January 2009, to become the head football coach at Yale; he was the first black head football coach in the school's history and the second in the history of the Ivy League.\nOn November 17, 2011, the Rhodes Scholarship pursuits of Yale's Patrick Witt brought attention to Williams's misinterpretated claim that he was also a Rhode Scholarship finalist. The truth of the matter is that Williams was urged by two of his teachers and football coach to get interviewed, as he would be the perfect candidate. The problem was that the first interview was at the same time as tryouts for the San Francisco 49ers. As told, Williams went to the tryouts instead. That he skipped his final interview in order to attend an NFL tryout is a mixture of half truths mixed with the meddling of Harvard graduate and writer for The Washington Post, Peter May. Right before the rival game between Yale and Harvard, May had obtained some information and painted the story in a different light. The public outcry was enough to start an investigation. The investigation lead to Rhodes Scholarship officials stating that they have no record of Tom Williams applying for a Rhodes Scholarship, and his name does not appear in the scholarship's trust databases. Yale launched an internal review on the matter as well.\nWilliams stepped down as Yale's head football coach due to the overwhelming pressure from Yale. He also admitted that he had never applied for a Rhodes Scholarship.\nAs of February 21, 2012 Williams was named University of Texas at El Paso's safeties coach. He served on the UTEP defensive staff under head football coach Mike Price.\nPersonal life.\nWilliams is married to Tonya; they have four children: Grace, Tom (Tre), Ana, and Lauren. Williams graduated from Trinity Valley School in Fort Worth, Texas.He has a master's degree in university administration from Stanford University. "

He was a member of the Canadian champion 1901 Ottawa team and captain of the Ottawa team for the 1902 season. He was one of the first professional players in ice hockey.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Duval played intermediate hockey for the Ottawa Aberdeens and Ottawa Atlantic Railway teams before joining the Ottawa Hockey Club in the 1899–1900 season. He played two further seasons for Ottawa, and was named captain prior to the 1902 season. In February 1903, his teammate Rat Westwick married Duval's sister Ruby.\nDuval moved to Pittsburgh to play professional ice hockey with the Pittsburgh Victorias of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL) in 1902–03. After two seasons with the Victorias, Duval joined the Pittsburgh Pros of the International Professional Hockey League for 1904–05.\nDuval died due to alcoholism on June 7, 1905. Duval had been acting in an unusual manner in the weeks previous, and had been drinking heavily. The reason for the heavy drinking was not fully disclosed publicly, however, a letter arrived at his boarding house after his death from his sister, advising Duval that the \"girl and the baby were doing well and that he should not be downcast.\" Duval had been suspended in December 1904 without pay by the Pros team for not being in condition to play although he returned to the team in time to score the winning goal in a game against Hod Stuart's Calumet team on January 7, 1905. He was released by the team in February 1905 for being unable to stay in condition to play. A \"Pittsburg Press\" newspaper report at that time said that \"'Peggy' when in condition can hold his end up with any of them, but the wine when it is red seems to have a fascination for him, hence his downfall.\" At the time of death, Duval was working for the Pennsylvania Railroad. Duval had previously worked for the Canada Atlantic Railway in Ottawa.\nStatistics.\n\"Statistics per Society for International Hockey Research at sihrhockey.org\""

        "title": "Turkey bowling",
        "text": "Turkey bowling is a sport which is based on ordinary bowling. A frozen turkey serves as the bowling ball and 10 liquid-filled plastic beverage bottles are used for bowling pins. The turkey is bowled down a smooth surface such as ice or a soap-covered sheet of painters plastic. The sport is commonly associated with Thanksgiving.\nTurkey bowling is popular in minor league ice hockey in the United States and Canada.\nThe original variant involves turkey bowling in an aisle of a grocery store. A Derrick Johnson claims to have invented turkey bowling in 1988 when he worked as a grocery clerk at a Newport Beach Lucky's branch while observing a manager slide a frozen turkey across the floor and accidentally topple a soda bottle.\nDerrick became a self-appointed commissioner of the \"Poultry Bowlers Association\" and codified the rules and terminology, such as \"the fowl line\" (cf. \"foul line\"), \"the gobbler\" (three strikes in a row; cf. turkey (bowling)), \"the Butterball\" (a gutterball) and \"the wishbone\" (a 7-10 split).\nNotable occurrences.\nTurkey bowling was featured in the 1995 novel \"Bloodsucking Fiends: A Love Story\" by Christopher Moore, where it was the favorite sport of \"The Animals\", a wild group of night grocery stockers (continued in the sequels \"You Suck: A Love Story\" and \"\").\nEpisode 14 of \"10 Items or Less\" TV series was \"Turkey Bowling\". This idea for this episode was given to John Lehr by David Howell, an aspiring comedy writer.\nThe \"Guy's Grocery Games\" episode \"Frozen Food Fight\" featured a round where two contestants bowled a frozen turkey at nine soda bottles; the combined number knocked down was the number of non-frozen items each was allowed to use in their next dish.\nEvery Thanksgiving morning, Cleveland, Ohio Fox affiliate WJW-TV does its annual Turkey Bowl. The WJW version of turkey bowling uses 15 cans of canned cranberry sauce, stacked in a pyramid shape, and uses a one-bowl-per-round knockout tournament format. In the 2010 edition, it was hosted by morning features and man-about-town reporter Kenny Crumpton and morning meteorologist Angelica Campos. In WJW-TV's version, people win prizes anything ranging from Giant Eagle Gift Cards to monetary prizes. The contest is broadcast on WJW live and streamed around the world on WJW's Web site, with the contests taking up the full closing segment (around 7 minutes) of each half-hour of WJW's morning newscast. The broadcast began in 1999. From then until 2019, the event was traditionally held at a Giant Eagle somewhere in Cuyahoga County; the 2021 contest was held in a garage.\nControversy.\nAnimal rights proponents, who oppose the use of animals in sports, claim that turkey bowling is disrespectful to animals and sends mixed messages which may encourage violence to animals or people. Another objection is perceived disrespect to the central attribute of Thanksgiving. In 2003, an upcoming event for the title of UK Great Turkey Bowling Champion at Manchester Evening News Arena was protested against by animal rights campaigners; as a result, plastic turkeys were used instead of real frozen turkeys. In 2007 an animal sanctuary rescued a live turkey, which was in a cage, from a turkey bowling event in New York State."

        "title": "Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series",
        "text": "The Fourth Test of the 1948 Ashes series was one of five Tests in a cricket series between Australia and England. The match was played at Headingley Cricket Ground at Leeds from 22 to 27 July with a rest day on 25 July. Australia won the match by seven wickets to take an unassailable 3–0 series lead. In successfully chasing a target of 404, they set a new world record for the highest victorious runchase in Test history, a record lasting until 1976.\nNeeding to win the match to prevent an Australian series victory, England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. England continued to rearrange their team, making three changes in an attempt to find a combination that could challenge Australia, which made two changes forced by injury. Unlike the preceding Tests, England's openers were able to withstand the Australian new ball attack, and the partnership of Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook put on 168 for the opening stand. Washbrook fell for 143 in the last over of the day, but England clearly had the better of the play, ending at 268/2 by stumps. Australia's bowlers were heavily criticised for their performance, which was seen as lethargic. The next day, England continued to amass runs, with Australia appearing unthreatening and unable to dislodge Bill Edrich and nightwatchman Alec Bedser, who batted until mid-afternoon. Bedser and Edrich then fell in quick succession for 79 and 111 respectively as England then collapsed and lost 8/73 to be all out for 496 late in the day. The hosts were heavily criticised for the collapse, which was largely due to unforced errors. Among the Australian bowlers, the wickets were shared. Australia then reached 63/1 in reply at stumps on day two.\nAustralia were in early trouble on the third morning when English bowler Dick Pollard removed Arthur Morris and captain Donald Bradman in the same over to leave the score at 68/3. However, Keith Miller (58) and Neil Harvey (112) launched a rapid counter-attack, adding 121 runs in 90 minutes in a display praised for its aesthetic beauty. They were later supported by Sam Loxton (93)—who hit five sixes—and Ray Lindwall (77), who both struck the ball powerfully. Australia ended the day at 457/9, having added 394 runs in one day, and 102 runs for the last two wickets to that point.\nAustralia were bowled out for 458 early on the fourth morning after the rest day, and England set about extending their lead, adding 129 for the first wicket, until both openers fell without further addition. In the meantime the workload on the Australian bowlers was heavy as Ernie Toshack had broken down in the first innings and unable to participate further. Edrich and Denis Compton took the score to 232/2 until a late collapse saw England reach stumps at 362/8. England batted on for two overs on the final day, declaring at 365/8. Bill Johnston was the most successful bowler with 4/95. This left Australia a target of 404 in less than a day, which would require a world record runchase, and allowed Yardley to use the heavy roller to break up the pitch, making batting even harder for the tourists. Most observers predicted an easy England win on a deteriorating surface. Australia started slowly, and Bradman joined Morris at 57/1 with 347 runs still needed in 257 minutes. They put together a stand of 301 in only 217 minutes, aided by erratic bowling, several missed catches and stumpings to help Australia to a win by seven wickets with 15 minutes remaining. Morris made 182 while Bradman was unbeaten on 173. The England selectors were heavily criticised after the match for failing to include a leg spinner in the team to exploit the favourable conditions. For the third time in a row, the match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England. Test attendance would never be as high again, as cricket became less popular in the UK.\nBackground.\nAustralia had gone through the first two months of their tour of England undefeated. After winning 10 of the first 12 games—the other two being drawn—eight of these by an innings, they won the First Test by eight wickets. Between the Tests, they defeated Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing against Yorkshire. They crushed England by 409 runs in the Second Test at Lord's, before defeating Surrey by ten wickets and crushing Gloucestershire by an innings and 363 runs, after amassing 774/7 declared, their highest score of the season. The Third Test was drawn amid rain interruptions that cost a day and a half of play; England had been in a strong position, having been 316 runs ahead with seven wickets in hand in their second innings when rain came at the end of the third day. Australia proceeded to claim a ten-wicket triumph over Middlesex in their only county game before the Fourth Test.\nAustralia made two changes for the Test at Headingley. Middle-order batsman Neil Harvey replaced the injured opener Sid Barnes, who had collapsed while fielding during the Third Test after being hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot. Australia declined to replace Barnes with the reserve opener Bill Brown, instead opting to use vice-captain Lindsay Hassett as a makeshift opener rather than in his customary position in the middle-order. Harvey had scored an unbeaten 73 and a 95 in the recent tour matches against Surrey and Gloucestershire respectively. Ron Saggers replaced first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test, and he exacerbated the injury during the match against Middlesex. Former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised the Australians for opting to use only one spinner, pointing out that he and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, a left-arm wrist spinner, had taken 17 wickets between them during the last Anglo-Australian Test at Headingley in 1938. O'Reilly cited a further instance of an Ashes Test at the same venue in 1934 in which he and Clarrie Grimmett had significant success for Australia. He wanted at least one of the two leg spinners, Colin McCool or Doug Ring, to have played alongside off spinner Ian Johnson, the only specialist spinner to have played in the three preceding Tests.\nEngland made three changes. George Emmett was dropped after making 10 and a duck on his debut, and Len Hutton was recalled to take his opening position after being controversially omitted after the Second Test. England's leading batsman, Hutton had scored 74 in the First Test and made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, when none of his teammates passed 26. O'Reilly praised the decision and the England selectors for stopping \"all nonsense and phoney tactics\". He further speculated that they would have done so irrespective of Hutton's form to avoid the wrath of the parochial Yorkshire spectators at Headingley, but in any case he regarded the original axing as scapegoating for England's two losses. O'Reilly believed the English administrators were penalising Hutton for angering them rather than poor performance. The decision to recall Hutton was met with wide approval from the cricketing public.\nJim Laker, the off spinner, replaced his left arm finger-spinning colleague Jack Young, who had taken 1/78 in the previous match against Australia for Middlesex, and totalled 3/174 in his two Tests in the series. Since his omission after the Second Test, Laker had taken 15 wickets in four matches for Surrey.\nMiddle-order batsman Tom Dollery, who had made only 38 in three innings in the Second and Third Tests, was replaced by all-rounder Ken Cranston. Playing mainly for Lancashire, Cranston had scored a century and four fifties, and taken 37 wickets in his last ten matches, but his previous outings against the tourists had not been successful. In two matches for the MCC and Lancashire against Australia, he had managed only 47 runs in three innings and a total of 2/109. English commentator John Arlott said Cranston's selection was an \"indication that the selectors were again hankering after the non-existent Test all-rounder\". O'Reilly regarded it as \"the best team that the English selectors chose during the season\" but felt they would be largely incapable of stopping an Australian series victory.\n22 July: Day One.\nAs Australia were leading 2–0 after three Tests, England needed to win the last two matches to square the series. The hosts won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch, which was seen as being unhelpful to fast bowling. Despite saying the pitch would be more conducive to spinners, O'Reilly described the playing strip as being \"so green that it was difficult to decide where the out-field ended and the pitch began\". Although fast, the outfield was bumpy in some parts. On some sections of the ground, there was a downward slope towards the edge of the playing arena, meaning the ball would accelerate downhill after being hit. At times the crowd spilled over the unfenced boundary, making the ground smaller than intended. All these factors meant scoring a boundary would be an easier task for the batsmen.\nThe England openers Cyril Washbrook and Len Hutton were given a loud reception as they walked out to bat, particularly the Yorkshire local Hutton. They had to face the Australian opening pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller without the aid of sightscreen. It was the first time some of the Australians had played in a first-class match without a sightscreen, and those cricketers would later have to bat without its assistance. It was believed the Yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen as it would have taken up space and lowered the capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.\nThe large crowd roared boisterously as Hutton got off the mark with a single in the first over from Lindwall. At the other end, Miller bowled with less pace than normal and his opening over saw three full tosses. In Miller's first over, Hutton scored the first boundary of the day, driving past mid-off. Both Australian pacemen felt their legs for strained muscles, and after two overs O'Reilly described as \"very innocuous\", Miller was taken off. He was replaced by the left-arm pace of Bill Johnston, who appeared to be having back problems. Johnston had bowled the most overs of any bowler on the tour and his loss would have meant a heavy workload for his remaining colleagues. Johnston's apparent discomfort led onlookers to opine that he should have been given more rest in the county matches. The Australian bowlers appeared to be unsettled and Bradman made four bowling changes in the first 50 minutes of play.\nBradman thought his faster bowlers could not extract much bounce from the surface and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 6–3 off-side field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers to cut through the vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.\nHutton then edged a ball from left-arm medium pacer Ernie Toshack through the slips, and was dropped by Lindsay Hassett on 25 after flicking the ball behind square leg from the medium pace of Sam Loxton. Hutton then hit a square drive past point and Washbrook pulled a ball along the ground past Harvey, who was patrolling the midwicket boundary. England were 88 without loss at the lunch interval, with Hutton and Washbrook on 46 and 41 respectively. After a slow start, they had scored at almost a run a minute after passing 50, and five boundaries were hit from a spell of six overs by Lindwall.\nImmediately after lunch, Lindwall made a confident appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) against Washbrook, but was not supported behind the stumps by a silent Saggers, and the umpire ruled against the tourists. At the other end, Hutton square drove Toshack for four, bringing up his fifty in 125 minutes. He followed this with another boundary in the same direction, and Washbrook back cut Lindwall for four more at the other end. This brought up England's 100, its first without loss for the series. Washbrook then on-drove a ball to the boundary and brought up his half-century, as Bradman pondered how to capture Australia's first wicket. England brought up 150 without loss 30 minutes before tea, and continued unhindered by two brief rain interruptions. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate.\nIn bright sunshine, Bradman called on the off spin of Ian Johnson, who had delivered only three overs to this point, the rest of the proceedings having been through fast bowlers. Seeking to stem the flow of runs, Bradman set a defensive ring field, with no slip in place. While Johnson bowled two consecutive maidens, Washbrook took 24 at the other end to reach 85. O'Reilly said Bradman's defensive field settings \"made the sorry admission of impotency\". Bradman then called for the new ball with the score on 164, which Hutton on-drove for four from Lindwall. This took the opening partnership to 168, the best by England in the series. Washbrook refrained from the hook shot, which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series. The partnership ended on the very next ball when Hutton went onto the front foot and was clean bowled by Lindwall, much to the dismay of the home crowd. Nevertheless, England had made a strong start, continuing their spirited showing in the previous Test. Washbrook was joined by Edrich, who had scored two 50s in the Third Test at Old Trafford after a lean start to the series. O'Reilly said the hosts' incoming batsmen had an ideal opportunity to amass a large score as \"the Australian attack was completely at the mercy of the two Englishmen. It had lost all its sting and looked quite innocuous.\"\nWashbrook reached his century with the score on 189/1; he reached triple figures half an hour after tea, having batted for 230 minutes and 16 boundaries. Washbrook avoided cross-batted shots and solidly defended shorter balls from the back foot, and profited from many over-pitched balls, which he drove away for boundaries. It was a welcome return to form for the opener from Lancashire. He had scored six, one, eight, 37 and 11 in his first five innings of the series, and was dropped on 21 in the second innings of the Third Test before proceeding to an unbeaten 85. After reaching his century, Washbrook began to play more expansively, driving in a manner that prompted Arlott to compare him to Frank Woolley.\nWashbrook and Edrich batted until late in the first day, when the former was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over before stumps, hitting a catch to Lindwall in the slips. His innings included 22 fours and the dismissal ended a second wicket partnership worth exactly 100 runs. Washbrook had been solid in his back foot defence and scored many runs from overpitched deliveries. Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman, and he survived the last four balls from Johnston as England closed at 268/2 without further addition to the score, with Edrich, who played fluently as he had done in the previous Test, on 41. England's supporters were much buoyed with the situation at the end of the first day.\nFormer Test batsman Jack Fingleton, who covered the tour as a journalist, said Australia's day went \"progressively downhill\" and described the efforts as the country's worst day of bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses. England had batted conservatively, steadily accumulating runs on a pitch unfavourable for fast bowlers, and Miller bowled placidly. Fingleton's fellow journalist and former playing colleague O'Reilly criticised the bowling display as the worst by the Australians on tour and said none of the bowlers could be excused. He lambasted the attack for operating \"without object—hopelessly and meaninglessly\" throughout the day. He decried the \"so-called attack\" for being \"so blatantly inaccurate both in direction in length\" and likened it to what was on offer in \"another monotonously uninteresting county match\". O'Reilly criticised Bradman's players for what he regarded as an overly casual and relaxed disposition in the morning, which gradually became more lethargic throughout the day as the home team strengthened their position. O'Reilly speculated that the tourists had become complacent because of their comfortable 2–0 series lead.\n23 July: Day Two.\nThe next day, England resumed hoping for more of what happened on the opening day. The ground was again full, with even more people squashed in than the previous day. The sun was obscured by heavy cloud cover, further hindering the visibility of a ground without a sightscreen. The two English batsmen were initially tentative and played and missed frequently, and only two singles were scored in the first 15 minutes of play. The England team frequently looked towards the sky; as they needed to win the match and were in a good position, they hoped that time would not be lost to rain. Bradman set a deep-set defensive field as he sought to have Lindwall and Johnston contain the batsmen before the third new ball became available. In all, England scored only five runs in the first half-hour, as the two batsmen sought to survive and be set when the new ball was taken and the Australian attack advantaged. During this time the main threat to the batsmen was Lindwall, who bowled a spell at high pace and unsettled Edrich, who sparred at a number of balls. As soon as it was possible, Bradman took the new ball, and Bedser endeavoured to keep his wicket intact to shield Denis Compton and the other middle-order batsmen from having to come in against a swinging ball. During this period Bedser did not attempt to exploit his strong physique to hit the ball hard. Continuing the defensive strategy of seeing off the new ball, it was not until the 48th minute of play that Edrich reached his 50 in 193 minutes, although he did miss several attempted cut shots that went past the outside edge. However, the hosts had seen off the new ball without losing a wicket. Bedser then glanced a ball for four; England scored only 22 runs in the first hour.\nAfter the new ball bowlers had finished their new ball spells, Bradman reverted to the slower bowlers, using run-saving, defensive field settings. Immediately thereafter, Bedser targeted Toshack and hit three consecutive fours and a two in one over. Bradman immediately removed the left-armer and replaced him with Johnson. The Australian captain set his infield rather deep, effectively allowing the batsmen to take easy singles. Bedser responded cautiously, surveying Johnson's off spin for one over, before going on the attack in the next. He lofted Johnson into the leg side three times, yielding a six over long on and two fours, taking his score to 47. Bedser then hit a ball back to the bowler Loxton, which was almost caught, before reaching 50. Bradman also brought back a tired Miller to bowl medium pace off breaks, to no avail. England went to the lunch adjournment at 360/2, with Edrich on 76 and Bedser on 52. They had added 92 for the session, including 70 in the second hour. Lindwall had been the only bowler who caused much difficulty to the batsmen, particularly concerning Edrich, but the Englishmen dealt with his colleagues comfortably and Miller, nursing fitness concerns, was forced to bowl medium-paced off breaks.\nEdrich and Bedser continued to amass runs after the break, and Lindwall appealed for lbw for the fourth time while Saggers remained silent. The pair brought up their century partnership as England scored 22 runs in the 30 minutes after lunch. Johnson came on, and Edrich lofted him for six to reach 96. Edrich then hit a long hop from the part-time wrist spin of Arthur Morris for four to reach his century. Bedser joined the attack and lifted Morris high over square leg for six, and Bradman replaced him with Toshack, who bowled a maiden. O'Reilly said that during the partnership, only Lindwall appeared capable of threatening the batsmen. He said Lindwall \"kept slogging away, tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after the other members of the attack had lost all signs of hostility... Bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much more than his share of the galley-slave work.\" O'Reilly decried Lindwall's workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity. However, against the run of play, Bedser was out caught and bowled by Johnson after almost three hours of batting, ending a 155-run stand for the third wicket. His on-drive was intercepted by the bowler, who dived across the pitch to his right-hand side to complete the catch. Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes in a Test best of 79. He appeared upset by his dismissal, patting the ball back to the bowler when he could have hit it decisively. Edrich attempted to pull a Johnson long hop to the leg side, targeting the large gap between square leg and mid-on, but only ballooned the ball to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on. This came only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 426/4. Edrich had batted for 314 minutes in compiling 111, with 13 fours and a six.\nWith two new batsmen—Compton and Jack Crapp—at the crease, Australia quickly made further inroads. Toshack bowled Crapp for five with an inside-edged half volley to leave England at 447/5. With this, Bradman took the new ball, and Compton exploited its hardness to score quickly. However, after the shine wore off and the ball went soft, Compton could not score for 25 minutes. O'Reilly decried Compton's \"helpless\" effort in failing to dispatch the tired Australian bowling as \"the worst Test innings I have seen him play\".\nAfter Compton and captain Norman Yardley had added 26 for the sixth wicket, the former edged Lindwall down the leg side, and Saggers completed his first Test catch to leave England at 473/6. O'Reilly speculated that Compton's inability to make progress against the bowling deflated his colleagues. Playing in his second Test of the summer, Loxton bowled Ken Cranston for 10 to claim his first Ashes wicket, leaving England at 486/7. Cranston opted to not play at a ball that went straight into his leg stump. Loxton then removed Godfrey Evans and Jim Laker in quick succession as England fell to 496/9. Evans fell meekly, prodding a ball straight to Hassett at silly mid-on, prompting O'Reilly to deem Loxton \"lucky to be on deck when the English tail were falling over themselves in their nervous speed to commit hara-kiri\". In contrast, Laker edged Loxton down the leg side and it took a diving, low catch from Saggers to complete the dismissal. Umpire Baldwin asked his colleague Chester at square leg to confirm the ball had carried on the full before sending Laker back to the pavilion. Miller then bowled Yardley to end England's innings at 496. The home side had batted for 192.1 overs and lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 73 runs. Loxton took 3/55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two apiece. However, the late wickets came at a cost for Australia, who lost the services of Toshack to a knee injury.\nThe collapse was heavily condemned. Fingleton said England \"encountered something [ascendancy over Australia] which they had not known in post-war cricket with Australia and did not know how to handle it\". O'Reilly called the capitulation a \"disgustingly bad show\". He asked what \"was there to make bowlers ... pulverize the carefully chosen cream of English batting on a perfect wicket?\" before concluding that the collapse was caused by \"an unfortunate absence of concentration\" rather than the opposition bowling. Both thought England had wasted an opportunity to put themselves in an unassailable position.\nWith Barnes injured, Hassett moved up from the middle order to open the innings with Morris. Using the new ball, Bedser removed Morris, who chipped the ball in the air to Cranston at mid-wicket and fell for six to leave Australia at 13/1. This brought Bradman to the crease and he was mobbed by the spectators on a ground where he had scored two triple centuries in Tests in 1930 and 1934. Many spectators surged onto the playing arena to greet Bradman, and he doffed his baggy green and raised his bat to acknowledge them. Fingleton wrote \"on this field he [Bradman] has won his greatest honours; nowhere else has he been so idolatrously acclaimed\".\nBradman got off the mark from his first ball, which Compton prevented from going for four with a diving stop near the boundary. Hassett was restrained while Bradman attacked, taking three fours from one Edrich over. Bradman was 31 and Hassett 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 63/1. The Australian captain did the majority of the scoring in the late afternoon, adding 31 in a partnership of 50. The tourists batted with little discomfort on a pitch that was still offering even bounce at a gentle pace.\n24 July: Day Three.\nOn the third morning, play resumed under hot and humid conditions. There had been rain on the pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed proceedings by taking a single from a Bedser no-ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable to get out of the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded low off the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.\nSensing the importance of the two quick wickets, in particular that of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, the crowd erupted. Australia were struggling at 68/3 as Harvey, playing his first Ashes Test and the youngest member of the squad at the age of 19, walked out bareheaded to join Miller at the crease. The tourists were more than 400 behind, and another wicket would expose the lower order and give England the opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Harvey told his senior partner \"What's going on out here, eh? Let's get stuck into 'em\". He got off the mark by forcing the ball behind point.\nThe pair launched a counterattack, Miller taking the lead. He hoisted off spinner Laker's first ball over the square leg fence for six. Miller shielded Harvey from Laker, as his younger partner was struggling against the off breaks that were turning away from him, including one that spun and bounced sharply to beating the outside edge. Miller drilled one off-drive off Laker for four, and after mis-hitting the next, much to the amusement of the crowd, hit the off spinner flat over his head, almost for six into the sightscreen. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, and Harvey joined the fightback in the next over, hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker, the second of which almost cleared the playing area. He struck another boundary to reach 44, while Miller's score stayed on 42. After half an hour of play, the early morning life in the pitch appeared to have died out.\nMiller then lifted Laker for another six over long off, hitting a spectator in the head. The English captain, noted for his ability to break partnerships with his occasional bowling, brought himself on. Miller responded by striking a four over long on from Yardley's bowling to reach 54. He drove the next ball through cover for four. The English skipper responded by stacking the leg side with outfielders and bowled outside leg stump, challenging Miller to attempt another hit for six. Yardley bowled a half-volley outside leg stump and the batsman obliged, but edged the ball off the back of his bat onto wicket-keeper Evans' head and was caught by a forward-diving Edrich at short fine leg.\nThe partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes, and was likened by \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" to a \"hurricane\". Fingleton said he had never \"known a more enjoyable hour\" of \"delectable cricket\". He acclaimed Miller's innings as \"one of the rarest gems in the Test collection of all time\" and \"a moment to live in the cricket memory\". O'Reilly said Miller and Harvey had counter-attacked with \"such joyful abandon that it would have been difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to gather from their methods of going about it that they were actually retrieving a tremendously difficult situation\". The crowd was in raptures at both the batting and Edrich's catch. Arlott said \"two of the greatest innings of all Test cricket were being played\", and praised Miller for elevating \"cricket to a point of aesthetic beauty\".\nLoxton came in to join Harvey at 189/4, who continued attacking, unperturbed by Miller's departure. Cranston came on and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for two consecutive boundaries. Yardley moved a man from fine leg to the location where the previous hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to where the fine leg fielder had been, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 204/4, with Harvey on 70.\nAfter lunch, Australia scored slowly as Loxton struggled to find his fluency against the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen with extra pace, but instead, Loxton began to settle in. The Australian lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and hit three fours off a subsequent Pollard over. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the middle session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. He had taken 177 minutes and hit 14 fours. Loxton then dominated the scoring in a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. The century stand yielded 105 runs in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment. Nevertheless, it was an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket, and Harvey's fast scoring helped to wrest the match back from England's firm control. O'Reilly said the innings was one of \"no inhibitions  completely unspoiled by any preconceived plan to eliminate any particular shot\". He added that it was \"the very mirror of truth in the batting art\", \"delightfully untrammeled by the scourage of good advice or any other handicapping influence\", and deemed Harvey's innings to be most pleasing he had seen since Stan McCabe's 232 at Trent Bridge in 1938.\nHarvey's departure at 294/5 brought the first of the bowlers, Johnson, to the crease. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting the off spinner for four more sixes, two over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery. On each occasion, umpire Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester's actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Laker refused to be deterred by the aggressive batting and continued to bowl normally by pursuing defensive off or leg theory. Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 329/6, hitting Laker to Cranston.\nAustralia was still some way behind when Lindwall replaced Johnson at the crease. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers came in and managed only five in his first Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker, who was still bowling in an attacking manner and flighting his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton had hit from him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before tea, with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.\nLindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling, dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. He particularly liked to use his feet to get to the ball on the half-volley so he could hit lofted drives. Of the 103 added for the last two wickets, Johnston and Toshack managed only 25 between them. Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before Toshack lasted the last 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston as his runner. Australia were 457/9 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12. During Lindwall's partnership with Johnston, Yardley bowled himself for over an hour, failing to bring on a frontline bowler in his stead despite being unable to dislodge the batsmen. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get the tailenders on strike. Despite Toshack and Johnston's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so he faced most of the balls. Lindwall's partners were able to survive against the English pacemen, leading O'Reilly to lament the absence of leg spinner Doug Wright, whose guile and flight was held in high regard by the Australians. O'Reilly thought Yardley may have bowled himself in an attempt to contain the Australians rather than dismiss them before the close of play, so his openers would not have to bat for a short period before stumps when the visitors' attack could have made inroads. However, Yardley was neither able to contain nor dismiss the Australian tail.\n26 July: Day Four.\nSunday was a rest day, and the match resumed on Monday morning. In the third over of the day, Lindwall was the last man out at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Bradman's men had added only one run to its overnight score of 457/9. Bedser took the final wicket as Lindwall edged, and Crapp took the catch low down in the slips with his left hand. Bedser ended with 3/92 and Laker 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each. England's use of Cranston as an all rounder had not been successful; he conceded almost four runs per over without taking a wicket. Although England had only a slight lead, Australia had the disadvantage of being a bowler short due to Toshack's injury. This meant Johnston and Johnson among the slower bowlers were left to exploit the wearing pitch.\nFor the remainder of the fourth day, England set about extending their lead. Early in the innings, the capacity crowd encroached substantially onto the ground and the umpires spent eight minutes trying to force them back to the edge of the official playing area, but they again spilled over. Initially, Hutton and Washbrook played cautiously to see off the new ball before trying to lift the run rate. Lindwall's first two overs were maidens, but Hutton and Washbrook scored 21 runs from his next five overs, while taking only five from Miller's six overs. The English batsmen attacked the bowling and reinforced their aggressive strokeplay with quick running. England reached lunch at 72/0 with Hutton on 40 and Washbrook on 28. Washbrook was particularly confident and Bradman decided to not risk Johnson in the morning session.\nThe afternoon session continued with further spectator encroachments. After lunch, Bradman set defensive fields with the intent of restricting the scoring, and used his remaining bowlers in short spells to conserve their energy, expecting a long day in the field. The absence of Toshack also meant Loxton had a substantial workload with the ball. The English batsmen continued to accelerate, and when Bradman finally brought Johnson into the attack, they targeted him. Washbrook hit a straight six from Johnson, and Hutton followed suit to take England from 98 to 104. For the second time in the match, the English openers had put on a century stand, and the shot also brought up Hutton's 50 in 125 minutes. This feat made Hutton and Washbrook the first pair to make century opening partnerships in both innings of a Test on two occasions; they had done this for the first time against Australia in the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval in 1946–47. Bradman replaced Johnson with Lindwall immediately, and Washbrook responded by cutting the paceman for four to reach his half-century. Lindwall responded with two bouncers. Washbrook then hooked one a short ball from Johnston and got a top edge, but Bradman failed to take the catch.\nWashbrook then attempted another hook from Johnston towards deep square leg. Connecting with the middle of the bat, he imparted much power on the ball, which flew flat and never went more than six metres above the ground. Harvey quickly moved in across the outfield from the square leg fence and bent over to catch the ball at his ankles while still on the run. Fingleton called it \"the catch of the season—or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [in an earlier match against Surrey]\". O'Reilly doubted \"whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it\". He further said the \"hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic\".\nJohnson then removed Hutton for 57 without further addition to the total, caught by Bradman on the run, leaving England at 129/2. The Yorkshire batsman went for a lofted shot and mistimed it high in the air after being beaten in flight, and the Australian captain ran backwards from mid-on to complete the catch. This meant the two new batsmen at the crease, Edrich and Compton, were still yet to score, and the second new ball was only six overs away, so they had to preserve their wickets while conditions were at their most favourable for Australia's fast bowlers. During a slow period in which only 15 runs came in half an hour, Edrich and Compton were pinned down by defensive field settings with no slips in place. After 45 minutes, Compton premeditated a charge down the pitch and hit Johnson to the leg side for a boundary. The pair accelerated, Compton taking risks in cutting Johnson against the spin. Australia took the new ball and each batsman hit a boundary to bring up the fifty partnership, which took an hour. Worried by the substantial and hazardous craters he and the other bowlers had created in the pitch while following through on the left-hand side of the crease, Lindwall changed to bowling from around the wicket and was warned by umpire Baldwin for running on the pitch, before reverting to over the wicket, although he delivered from the edge of the crease to avoid the holes. O'Reilly said Baldwin's warning to Lindwall had played into Australia's hands as the bowler's follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right-hander's off stump, which the English bowlers could target when Bradman's men had to chase the target. Compton then hit boundaries with hooks and pulls from Lindwall and Johnston and England went to tea at 209/2. Compton was on 42 and Edrich 33.\nAfter the interval, Bradman continued with his strategy of rotating his bowlers in short spells, and set a defensive, well-spread field for Johnson's bowling. Edrich hit three consecutive boundaries from Johnson before lofting a fourth ball into the crowd for six. He then passed his half-century—his fourth consecutive Test score in excess of 50—before Lindwall trapped him lbw for 51 to leave England at 232/3, ending a third-wicket partnership of 103. Crapp came in and added 18 before he was bowled by Lindwall, inside edging an attempted forcing stroke through the off side from the back foot. This left England at 260/4, and precipitated a mini-collapse. Yardley deliberately lifted Lindwall over the vacant slips region and reached seven before he fell to Johnston, caught by a leaping Harvey while attempting a lofted shot. Johnston then had Cranston caught behind for a duck with only a further run added to leave England at 278/6, a lead of 316. Evans came in and edged his first ball through the slips at a catchable height for four. Compton drove Lindwall for a boundary but then fell to Johnston for 66, caught by Miller at cover. England were 293/7 with no recognised batsmen remaining, having lost 4/33. Wicket-keeper Evans was joined by Bedser, and the pair added 37 before Miller removed the latter. Laker came in and helped Evans to add a further 32 as England reached 362/8 at the close of the fourth day. Evans—mainly through boundaries—had helped England to add 69 runs in the last 45 minutes of play.\n27 July: Day Five.\nEngland batted on for five minutes during the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 365/8, with Evans unbeaten on 47. Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures, with 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller at the start of the morning, which would help break up the wicket and make it more likely to spin. Bradman had done a similar thing during the previous Ashes series in Australia before setting England a target. The hosts needed to beat Australia to avoid a series defeat. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his opinion that such a device would make the surface less favourable for batting.\nThe declaration left Australia with a victory target of 404 runs. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting their dismissal by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spinners. In addition, most of the Australian onlookers present at the ground thought their team had no chance of victory. Morris and Hassett started slowly, making only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce. It appeared they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point. In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings, Morris chipped the ball in the air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, but this time the ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes Australia had scored only 10 runs.\nAfter Bedser had bowled three overs, Yardley introduced Laker in his place in the seventh over to exploit the spin. An attacking field, with two slips and a gully, was put in a place, but Laker bowled inaccurately and the Australian openers took 13 runs from his first over. Hassett hit a four and took a single to give Morris the strike. Morris hit a four, was beaten by a bouncing ball that hurried off the pitch and then hit another boundary. Despite this over, only 44 runs came in the first hour, meaning that 360 runs were needed in 285 minutes. After his poor first over, Laker had settled down and conceded only two runs from his next six overs. The frustrated crowd heckled the Australian openers for their slow scoring and Morris was ironically applauded after taking a single. Evans then missed a leg-side stumping opportunity against Hassett, and Bedser beat each of the Australians with extra bounce. During his early spell, Laker \"was getting at least one ball every over to turn considerably\".\nNoting Laker's ability to extract substantial turn from the pitch, Yardley brought on the part-time left-arm unorthodox spin of Compton, who bowled inaccurately although with some turn. Morris struck two fours in Compton's first over to register Australia's 50 in 64 minutes. Compton's next over was more potent; he deceived Morris, who danced down the pitch and missed the ball, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. At the time, Morris was on 32 and Australia at 55/0. Laker beat Morris in the next over with an off break that spun a foot, and in the succeeding over, Hassett was dismissed by Compton with the score at 57. Compton had caught Hassett's leading edge and dived forward in his follow through to catch the ball one-handed just above the ground.\nBradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. After receiving another rapturous welcome from the Headingley spectators in his last innings at the ground, the Australian captain signalled his intentions by hitting a boundary from Compton and another off the first ball he faced from Laker, cover driving against the spin. Bradman reached 12 in six minutes.\nYardley then called upon the occasional leg spin of Hutton in an attempt to exploit the turning wicket. The latter had taken only four wickets in the 1947 English season and had never dismissed an Australian batsman in ten Tests against such opponents. As Australia were still behind the required run rate, Yardley could afford to take risks and sacrifice some runs if he got wickets in return. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours from Hutton's first over, which Fingleton described as \"rather terrible\" due to the errant length. This over took Morris to 51. After an economical over from Compton, Bradman took two fours off Hutton's next over before almost holing out to Yardley. Despite the near miss, the 20 runs from Hutton's two inaccurate overs had allowed Australia to reach 96/1 from 90 minutes.\nIn the next over, Compton bowled a googly to deceive Bradman, who expected the ball to turn in. However, it went the other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman leg glanced the next ball for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball of the over. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed to hold on to the catch. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. Compton had control of Bradman for the over, but went unrewarded. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 121/1, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both Morris and Bradman had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.\nUpon resumption, Compton continued as Yardley attempted to exploit the turning wicket. However, Compton was not a regular bowler and he sent down a series of ill-directed full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs. Morris struck seven fours in two overs of what Fingleton called \"indescribably bad bowling\". This included six fours in eight balls. As Morris continued to attack, Compton began to crack under the pressure and his inaccuracy increased. The part-time bowler had generated trouble for the batsmen by tossing the ball up and beating the bat or inducing edges, but Morris counterattacked with drives. Compton tried to hold back his length to avoid being driven but the Australian opener pounced on the shorter balls. Morris reached the 90s just 14 minutes after the interval and hit another boundary to reach his century in a little over two hours. Morris had added 37 runs since lunch, mainly from Compton's wayward offerings, while Bradman had added only three.\nThe onslaught prompted Yardley to take the new ball and replace Compton with his pacemen. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Cranston's bowling, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived forward and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. England began to become demoralised and their fielding continued to deteriorate. Bradman hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken while Bradman was being treated, and Morris had to shield his captain from the strike until the pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.\nMorris was given another life on 136 when Laker dropped him while fielding at square leg from Compton's bowling. Bradman was given another life at 108 when he advanced two metres down the pitch to Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity with the batsman far out of his ground. Australia reached tea at 292/1 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, after hitting a tired-looking shot to mid-off, having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in a 290-minute innings. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. Miller struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling lbw to Cranston with eight runs still needed. Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. Australia had won by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test runchase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes of batting with 29 fours.\nThe attendance of 158,000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34,000 pounds. The crowd remains a record for a Test in England.\nAftermath.\nAfter the Fourth Test, the Australians had five tour matches before the final Test. They defeated Derbyshire by an innings, before having a washout against Glamorgan. The Australians then defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets, before drawing with Lancashire, who hung on with three wickets in hand on the final day. This was followed by a two-day non-first-class match against Durham, which was drawn after rain washed out the second day. During this period, Barnes returned to action after recuperating from his rib injury. Toshack also recovered to play against Lancashire, but injured himself again and was ruled out of the remainder of the tour.\nFollowing Australia's unlikely win at Headingley, the England selectors were widely condemned for their failure to choose a specialist wrist spinner to exploit the turning pitch. This was cited as a reason for the hosts' loss, as the part-timer Compton was able to trouble the batsmen and generate opportunities for wickets, only to see them foregone because of missed catches and stumpings. In response, the English selectors made four changes to the team for the Fifth Test, one of these being the inclusion of leg spinner Eric Hollies. Their frequent changes to the team meant the hosts used a total of 21 players for the five Tests, and the repeated changes to personnel resulted in heavy criticism.\nDespite Hollies being able to trouble most of their batsmen, Australia completed the Test series with a convincing innings victory in the Fifth Test to complete a 4–0 result. The Fifth Test was the last international match, and Australia had only seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman's aim of going through the tour undefeated. They secured three consecutive innings victories against Kent, the Gentlemen of England and Somerset. They proceeded to take first innings leads of more than 200 against the South of England and Leveson-Gower's XI, but both matches were washed out. The last two matches were two-day non-first-class matches against Scotland, both won by an innings. Bradman's men thus completed the tour undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\".\nThe runchase of 404 stood as a record until 1976. As of 2020, it is the fourth highest successful runchase (and the third highest successfully chased target) in Test cricket history."

        "title": "Third Test, 1948 Ashes series",
        "text": "The Third Test of the 1948 Ashes series was one of five Tests in the Ashes cricket series between Australia and England. The match was played at Old Trafford in Manchester from 8 to 13 July 1948, with a rest day on 11 July. The match was drawn after the whole of the fourth day and the first half of the fifth day was washed out due to rain; England had the upper hand before the weather intervened. The draw maintained Australia's 2–0 lead in the series, which was established through victories in the first two Tests. As Australia were the holders of The Ashes, the draw meant that England could do no better than level the series 2–2 by winning the last two Tests, and thus Australia retained The Ashes.\nThe Test started amid controversy following the omission of leading England batsman Len Hutton for performing poorly in the previous match. Having largely failed—apart from brief periods—to challenge Australia in the first two Tests, the hosts had made four changes to their team in an attempt to find a combination that could threaten the visitors' supremacy. Australia made their first change for the series, ending the Test career of veteran batsman Bill Brown after two poor matches. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Denis Compton left the field after being bloodied in the head by a Ray Lindwall bouncer. At this stage, the hosts were at 33/2 with an injured player, and they batted defensively for a period to try and regroup. Having received treatment, Compton returned with England in difficulty at 119/5 midway through the day and proceeded to score 145 not out, aided by several dropped catches, helping England to recover to 363 all out on the second afternoon.\nCompton and seamer Alec Bedser were involved in a mix-up, resulting in the latter being run out and ending a 121-run partnership. Lindwall was the most successful bowler, taking 4/99. During the England innings, Australian opener Sid Barnes, who had gained much attention throughout the season for fielding at point-blank range in front of the batsman on strike, was hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot and had to be carried from the ground and hospitalised. In reply, Australia batted steadily to be 126/3 by the end of the second day but then fell to 172/6—effectively seven wickets down with Barnes unable to bat after collapsing again—before evading the follow on by reaching 221. Australia scored slowly through the innings, finding the hosts' bowlers difficult to negotiate; Bedser took 4/81 and Pollard 3/53.\nEngland began their second innings and were strongly placed on 174/3 at the end of the third day, an overall lead of 316 with seven wickets in hand. They had been aided by several dropped chances against Cyril Washbrook, who reached 85 by the close of play. However, rain meant that no play was possible on the fourth day and England did not have the opportunity to capitalise on their favourable position and set Australia a high runchase. Yardley declared on the final morning, but play did not start until mid-afternoon due to continuing inclement weather. The Australian batsman thereafter played for a draw; they batted slowly and reached 92/1 when stumps were drawn, not making an attempt to chase the 317 for victory. Arthur Morris made 54 not out, his second half-century of the match to go with his 51 in the first innings, registering Australia's top-score on both occasions. Although 30% of the playing time was lost to rain, the match still managed to set a record for the highest attendance at a Test match in England, surpassing the mark set in the previous Test.\nBackground.\nLed by Donald Bradman, Australia had proceeded through the first two months of their 1948 England tour undefeated. After winning 10 of the 12 games before the Tests, eight of these by an innings, they won the First Test by eight wickets. Before the Second Test, they defeated Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing with Yorkshire. Bradman's men then crushed England by 409 runs in the Second Test at Lord's. Between Tests, they defeated Surrey by ten wickets and crushed Gloucestershire by an innings and 363 runs, having amassed 774/7 declared, their highest score of the season, and the second highest ever by an Australian team in England.\nWhen the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, leading English batsman Len Hutton had been dropped. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the previous Test, during which he scored 20 and 13. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would have a negative effect on the rest of the side—which was not in good batting form—as it was a poor example from a key player. According to journalist and retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, Hutton's second innings at Lord's had been the worst of his career and gave the impression he had been scared of the Australian pace attack. The omission generated considerable controversy, and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was England's best batsman, and thought he had been treated poorly by the selectors. Former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, and 94, 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. O'Reilly regarded Hutton's omission as punitive and vindictive. He said if Hutton needed to be shielded from the new ball attack, then England should have reshuffled their batting order to place their beleaguered opener down the order. O'Reilly said that as Hutton had a large range of attacking strokes, he was not a stereotypical, defensive opener who was mainly used to wear down the opening bowlers, and could be used in the middle order as an aggressor.\nHutton's opening position was taken by debutant George Emmett, who made 43 and nine for Gloucestershire in Australia's preceding tour match. In that match, two of Australia's leading pacemen, Keith Miller and Bill Johnston, did not bowl. Despite scoring 76 and 92 in the preceding match against Warwickshire, Emmett was not having a prolific season; he ended the summer with an average of 36.11.\nEngland made three further changes. Spinner Jack Young and paceman Dick Pollard replaced the spin pair of Doug Wright and Jim Laker in the bowling department, meaning England would only play one slow bowler. Wright and Laker had struggled to penetrate the Australian batting lineup in the Second Test, taking match figures of 2/123 and 2/128 respectively. In contrast, Pollard had taken match figures of 4/85 for Lancashire in a match against Australia earlier in the season, and had taken 27 wickets in four county matches in the past fortnight. The selection was seen as being influenced by the fact the Test was being staged at Lancashire's home ground, where Pollard was familiar with the conditions, and the Australians had a high regard for him. In the month since being dropped for the Second Test in favour of Wright, after taking 1/107 in the First Test, Young had returned to play for Middlesex, taking 27 wickets in five matches. Alec Coxon, the Yorkshire allrounder who made his Test debut in the previous match at Lord's and opened the bowling, taking match figures of 3/172 and scoring 19 and a duck, was replaced by Jack Crapp, a debutant batsman. Crapp had scored 100 not out and 32 for Gloucestershire in the preceding match against the tourists. It was only the third century scored against Australia during the tour, and was part of a season in which Crapp had made four centuries and six half-centuries in 16 matches thus far. Coxon's omission was believed to have been caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There was a story that he punched Denis Compton—whom he disliked and considered self-important—in the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. O'Reilly interpreted the omission of the Yorkshiremen Hutton and Coxon at the expense of the Gloucestershire pair of Crapp and Emmett as symptoms of a regional bias in the English selection panel. He pointed out that only one of the four selectors—England captain Norman Yardley, who was also from Yorkshire—was from the north of the country.\nAustralia dropped Bill Brown, who had scored 73 runs at a batting average of 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. Brown was Australia's reserve opener, but Bradman opted to play him out of position in the middle-order, instead of using a specialist. Brown had also struggled in his unfamiliar position in the matches against Worcestershire and the Marylebone Cricket Club, scoring 25 and 26. According to O'Reilly, Brown had appeared out of place in the middle-order because he was used to the opener's classical role of defending against and wearing down the opening bowlers, rather than attacking. He was replaced by the all rounder Sam Loxton, who had hammered an unbeaten 159—including several sixes—against Gloucestershire, and that innings was particularly noted for his quick footwork, which he used to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard.\n8 July: Day One.\nThe match started amid clear weather, a far cry from the previous Ashes Test at the ground in 1938, which was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to continuous rain for several days. The outfield was also smooth and green, a contrast to its state during World War II, when it was left cratered by German bombing raids. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.\nThe change in England's opening pair did not result in an improvement on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided following a mix-up on the first ball, and Cyril Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. The Australians started with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and had to swap his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass. At the other end, Washbrook also played watchfully and avoided any horizontal bat shots, apart from a missed cut against Johnston's bowling. Overall, the English openers appeared comfortable in the first half-hour of play.\nWith 22 runs on the board after half an hour of play, Washbrook played around a yorker from Johnston and was bowled, much to the disappointment of his Lancashire home crowd. Johnston had been bowling from over the wicket, and his left-arm deliveries had generally been swinging back into the right-handed Washbrook. However, the opening batsman did not detect Johnston's variation ball, which was released from wide of the crease and angled across more sharply without curling back in. Washbrook played inside the line of the ball, which hit his stumps. Australia nearly had two wickets in the same over as the new batsman Bill Edrich struggled. He played loosely outside the off stump to the first ball but did not get an edge, and on the third delivery he faced from Johnston, Edrich survived again. Receiving a ball on middle and leg stump, he tried to defend it straight back down the pitch, rather than the conventional stroke to the leg side, and managed to edge the ball past the slips for four.\nSix runs after the fall of Washbrook, the diminutive Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to Sid Barnes at short leg, leaving England 28/2. Surprised by Lindwall's bouncer, Emmett took his eyes from the ball and fended with one hand on the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett's bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia's match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not deliver any more bouncers to Emmett during the match, and O'Reilly thought the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent's weakness against the short ball. O'Reilly concluded that Australia's pace duo \"had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort.\"\nEdrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Denis Compton attempted to establish themselves. He was hurried by the pace of Lindwall and Johnston, making many last-moment movements to either hit the ball or withdraw from a shot.\nLindwall bowled a series of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman attempted to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no-ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For a series of accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.\nUpon the resumption, Crapp began to accelerate, hitting a six—which flew directly back over the bowler's head and over the sightscreen—and three driven boundaries from the off spin of Ian Johnson. This was a stark contrast to Johnson's first ten overs before lunch, which had yielded only seven runs. Crapp was eager to use his feet to get to the pitch of Johnson's deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. He then hit Toshack to Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs. Australia took the new ball with the score at 87 and Lindwall trapped Crapp—who did not offer a shot—leg before wicket for 37; the batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. Tom Dollery came in and took a single to get off the mark but then missed a Johnston yorker and was bowled. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook's in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston's variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. Captain Norman Yardley came in and played the fast bowling of Lindwall and Johnston with relative ease, retreating onto the back foot to allow himself more time to play his shots. Edrich was struck on the hand and Yardley edged to Keith Miller in the slips cordon on the half-volley.\nAfter 170 minutes of slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall delivery and was caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon. At 119/5, Compton returned to the field, his head wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.\nThis brought wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans to the crease and exposed the hosts' lower-order. The last of the specialist batsmen, Compton nearly departed soon after when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson's off spin. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, the benefit of the doubt was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected. Compton made use of this and attacked Toshack successfully, forcing Bradman to make a bowling change. In fading light, Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans—who attempted a wild slash—to leave England 216/7. Compton reached stumps on 64, accompanied by Alec Bedser, who was on four, as England ended the day at 231/7. Compton had been dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before being missed on 64 by the wicket-keeper from the bowling of Johnston just before stumps.\n9 July: Day Two.\nEngland resumed on the second day at 231/7 amid dark skies and the threat of rain; Australia was unable to break through despite taking the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians, playing with a straight bat and stretching forward onto the front foot to block the ball. Tallon dropped Compton for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston when the batsman was on 73. Lindwall bowled well below his top pace in the morning session and the batsmen slowly accumulated their runs. Bedser was the more defensive of the two Englishmen, and Compton drove Toshack past mid on for a four to register his second century of the series, after 235 minutes of batting. Lindwall then beat Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch, but the Englishman survived. England reached lunch at 323/7 having added 92 runs without losing a wicket. Compton was on 123 and Bedser on 37, having brought up their century partnership. Five minutes were lost in the morning session when a stray dog invaded the playing arena and evaded policemen and a number of Australian fielders who attempted to catch it.\nImmediately subsequent to the resumption, Compton took two boundaries from Lindwall's first over and another from Johnston's subsequent over. He then hit a ball into the covers and Bradman and Loxton collided in an attempt to prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end with Bedser a long way short of the crease. It ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 and featured in a 121-run partnership with Compton. According to O'Reilly, it was the only mistake Compton made in his innings. The stand fell five runs short of England's highest Test partnership for the eighth wicket against Australia, a mark set by Patsy Hendren and Harold Larwood.\nPollard came to the crease and soon pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg. Barnes stood closer than virtually all in that position, with one foot on the edge of the cut strip and he was unable to evade the ball. Barnes \"dropped like a fallen tree\", and had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination. Throughout the season, Barnes had received a mixed reception for his tactics; it was agreed they had a negative effect on the batsman, and there was a debate as to whether it was in the spirit of the rules. Compton hit two fours and Bradman responded by putting all of his men on the boundary to offer Compton a single so Pollard would be on strike and could be attacked. The Australia skipper then brought his men in close during the latter part of the over to prevent Compton from taking a single and regaining the strike for the following over. Compton was unable to farm the strike as he desired.\nToshack then bowled Pollard and Bradman caught Young from Johnston's bowling as England were dismissed for 363. Compton was unbeaten on 145 after 324 minutes of batting, having struck 16 fours. Lindwall took 4/99 and Johnston 3/67. Miller did not bowl, so the four remaining frontline bowlers sent down no less than 38 overs each.\nAustralia came out to bat halfway through the middle session. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only Arthur Morris as a specialist opener. Johnson was thus deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He had never opened at Test level, but had once batted at No. 3 when used as a nightwatchman after the fall of the first wicket late on a day's play. He was unable to make an impact—Bedser removed him for one, caught by Evans at chest height off the inside edge from a ball that reared from the pitch. It was a difficult catch as Evans was standing up to the stumps and he had little time to react to the ball's change of direction. O'Reilly criticised the use of Johnson as an opener, as vice-captain Lindsay Hassett had transformed himself into a defensive batsman with little backlift and a guarded approach. Johnson's dismissal brought Bradman in to face the new ball. The Australian captain thus had to face Bedser, who had already dismissed him three times in the Tests with a new ball, and Pollard, who had troubled him in the match against Lancashire. Pollard then trapped Bradman lbw with an off cutter that struck the Australian captain on the back foot for seven to leave Australia in trouble at 13/2. This provoked a strong cheer from the crowd in support of Pollard, the Lancashire local. Australia were pinned down as Pollard bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run, aiming for leg stump to stifle the scoring. He was partnered by Bedser, who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes.\nMorris and vice-captain Lindsay Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes. They played sedately without trying to take risks. Hassett fell after being beaten in flight by Young. Aiming to break Young's restrictive leg side bowling, Hassett charged down the pitch and lofted a drive for four. However, in attempting a similar lofted drive over cover, he mishit the ball, which was caught by Washbrook at wide mid-off. Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps, with their personal tallies on 23 and 48 respectively. The run rate picked up in the last 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time.\n10 July: Day Three.\nThe weather was sunny on the third morning, and a large Saturday crowd had arrived from afar to watch proceedings; as a result, the gates were closed by 9:00 am with the ground already filled. The large gallery again encroached on the playing arena, which was not fenced. In the first hour, Australia struggled against the new ball. Miller was beaten three times in one over by Bedser before Pollard trapped him for 31, after Australia had added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Bedser removed Morris for 51, leaving Australia 139/5. It had been a slow morning for Morris, who took 21 minutes to add to his overnight total and reached his half-century 45 minutes into the day's play, having added only four runs to his overnight score. At the same time, Barnes had come out to bat upon Miller's dismissal, despite having collapsed while practising in the nets due to the aftereffects of his rib injury. He batted after refusing to stay in hospital and returning to the ground in spite of his bruised and discoloured ribs. He made a painful single in 25 minutes of batting before the injury became too much and he had to be taken from the ground with the assistance of Bradman among others, before being sent to hospital to be put under observation. Barnes would eventually miss two and a half weeks of cricket.\nTallon and Loxton added a further 33 before the former was caught behind from Edrich with the score at 172/6. Lindwall came into bat with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on. He received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand and caused visible pain, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled by Pollard, leaving Australia 208/7, still five runs behind the follow-on mark. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow-on before Bedser removed both. Johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from Pollard in the direction of Edrich at first slip, but Evans dived across, trying to catch the ball in his right hand. The wicket-keeper could not hold on to the ball at full stretch, and the resulting deflection further to the right wrong-footed Edrich, who was moving the other way, and it went past him. From second slip, Crapp dived left behind Edrich but the ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers. However, in the next over Bedser, Johnston edged the ball in the same manner and Crapp caught the ball easily. Lindwall was the last man out for 23, while Toshack was unbeaten without scoring. Australia were thus bowled out for 221, giving England a lead of 142 runs. Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers, taking 4/81 and 3/53 respectively.\nAt the start of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who then removed Emmett for a duck. The paceman pitched an outswinger on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who took it in his right hand while taking a dive.\nEmmett's departure brought Lindwall's tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised his speedster not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, fearing such actions would be interpreted as retaliation and provoke a negative media and crowd reaction. After not bowling in the first innings, Miller came on and immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the bails. Washbrook then drove Lindwall for four before Miller bounced him in the next over. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. Lindwall followed Miller's lead towards Washbrook and was no-balled by umpire Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. Following a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the matter faded away and the bowler was not no-balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman.\nLindwall then bounced Washbrook again and this time the England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew high in the air straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch on his third juggled attempt. Having received a life on 21, Washbrook settled down as Loxton replaced Lindwall, while Johnson replaced Miller. Washbrook scored on both sides of the wicket and reached 50 in only 70 minutes as England proceeded to 80/1.\nLindwall returned for a new spell and almost hit Washbrook in the head. After tea, Edrich hit Miller for four. Although Lindwall did not retaliate for the bouncers he received in the first innings, Miller did so with four consecutive short balls, earning the ire of the crowd. Miller struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened, ordered him to stop, and apologised to Edrich. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes, England's largest of the series to that point. Edrich hit a four to long on, followed by a lofted off drive for six from the bowling of Toshack, generating momentum in their favour. However, Washbrook called Edrich through for a quick single soon after. The batsmen hesitated and after both Englishmen had paused in the middle of their run, Morris threw down Edrich's stumps from cover, ending the partnership at 125/2. Edrich had struck eight boundaries and a six in his 53.\nToshack then removed Compton for a duck, caught in the slips by Miller, leaving England three wickets down with the score still on 125. Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball, stopping Australia's fightback as England reached 174 by the close without further loss. Washbrook was unbeaten on 85 and Crapp 19. England were 316 runs in front with two days of play remaining and seven wickets in hand. Their position was aided by the Australian fielders, who dropped Washbrook twice more. The Lancastrian was on 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg and was again dropped by Hassett. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman to signify his need for protection from the ball, much to the amusement of the crowd. After adding two more runs, Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack. At the end of the day's play, Washbrook purchased a drink for Hassett in gratitude for the dropped catches.\n13 July: Day Five.\nThe rest day was followed by the fourth day, which was abandoned due to persistent rain. Despite this, 21,000 spectators came in anticipation of the weather clearing so that some play would be possible. However, a northeasterly depression from the Faroe Islands brought ongoing precipitation and prevented any play.\nYardley declared at the start of the fifth day after a pitch inspection, leaving Australia a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire first session was abandoned. The umpires had decided to start play half an hour later than normal, but this was not possible and they helped the ground staff to clean up the wet surface. Bradman chose to use the light roller and play was supposed to begin as soon as the lunch break ended.\nFurther delay meant play began after the tea break, and the pitch played very slowly because of the excess moisture, which also caused there to be little bounce in the surface. With Australia not looking to chase the runs because the time available was not reasonable, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. In the first half-hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Young replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp, who completed the catch. Johnson fell for six to leave Australia at 10/1.\nBradman came in and played his first 11 balls from Young without scoring, while Morris hit two streaky shots for four from Bedser. Yardley used the spin of Young and Compton for an hour, while Morris and Bradman made little effort to score. For 105 minutes, Morris stayed at one end and Bradman at the other; neither looked to rotate the strike with singles. Bradman only played eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled by his partner's desire for a single that he sent him back. The tourists thereafter batted in an unhurried and defensive manner to ensure a draw, which was sealed by a series of periodic rain interruptions. They ended on 92/1 from 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, with 35 maidens. It was the slowest innings run rate to date in the series. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century of the series. O'Reilly criticised the approach taken by the Australians in the closing stages of the match, attributing it to Bradman's orders. He said the pitch was made so tame by the heavy rain that they could have played in a natural and attractive manner to entertain the spectators, rather than defending carefully. He said Bradman's \"unwillingness to take a risk or to accept the challenging call of some particular phase of the game is one of the greatest flaws\" in his leadership.\nThe attendance of 133,740 exceeded the previous record for a Test in England, which was set in the preceding match at Lord's even though more than 30% of the playing time had been lost.\nAftermath.\nAfter being aided by rain while in a disadvantageous position during the Third Test, the Australians had only one tour match—a victory over Middlesex—to prepare for the next Test at Headingley. Barnes was unable to recover from his injury in this short space of time, and was replaced by Neil Harvey. Instead of opting to use reserve opener Brown to replace Barnes, Australia played Hassett out of position to partner Morris, while Harvey took a middle-order slot.\nFor England's part, Washbrook's second innings half-century at Old Trafford, aided by multiple dropped catches, was regarded as a major factor in his retention for the Headingley match, having scored only 63 runs in the first five innings of the series. He was reunited with Hutton, whose controversial exile lasted only one Test before Emmett was dropped. Dollery, who had made only 38 in three innings in the Second and Third Tests, was replaced by all-rounder Ken Cranston. Despite being productive in domestic matches during the season, Cranston had struggled in his previous outings against the tourists. In two matches against Australia, he had managed only 47 runs in three innings and a total of 2/109.\nWashbrook and Hutton put on 168 for the first wicket, the first time England had put on more than 42 for opening stand, as the hosts went on to make 496, their highest score for the series. Despite this, Australia's batsmen set a world record by chasing down 404 on the final day to win by seven wickets and take a series-winning 3–0 lead.\nFollowing the historic win at Headingley, Australia had five tour matches before the final Test. They won three while two ended in rain-curtailed draws. During this period, Barnes returned to action after recuperating from his rib injury. Australia then completed the series in style with a convincing innings victory in the Fifth Test at The Oval to complete a 4–0 result. The Fifth Test was the last international match, and the tourists only had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman's aim of going through the tour undefeated. Apart from two matches against the South of England and Leveson-Gower's XI, which were washed out after Australia had secured first innings leads of more than 200, Bradman's men had little difficulty, winning the remaining five fixtures by an innings. They thus became the first touring Test team to complete an English season undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\"."

        "title": "Second Test, 1948 Ashes series",
        "text": "The Second Test of the 1948 Ashes series was one of five Tests in The Ashes cricket series between Australia and England. The match was played at Lord's in London from 24 to 29 June, with a rest day on 27 June 1948. Australia won the match by 409 runs to take a 2–0 lead, meaning that England would need to win the remaining three matches to regain The Ashes.\nAustralian captain Don Bradman won the toss and elected to bat. The tourists had won the First Test convincingly, and decided to field the same team, while England made three changes, mainly to adopt a more attacking bowling strategy. Australia started strongly, led by opener Arthur Morris, who scored 105 and took the score to 166/2 mid-way through the first day. However, the later batsmen struggled after his departure and fell to 258/7 by the end of the first day, handing the home team the advantage. However, a lower-order counterattack on the second morning saw Australia reach 350, wicket-keeper Don Tallon scoring 53. For England, the seamer Alec Bedser was the most successful bowler, taking 4/100. Australian paceman Ray Lindwall then cut through the English top-order, reducing them to 46/4. After a recovery an 87-run partnership between Denis Compton—who top-scored with 53—and captain Norman Yardley, both fell within one run of each other and England looked set to be dismissed short of the follow on mark when they were at 145/7. However, the lower order resisted stoutly and they ended at 215 early on the third morning; Lindwall took 5/70. Australia then set about extending their first innings lead, and opener Sid Barnes led the way, scoring 141. He put on an opening partnership of 122 with Morris (62), and added 174 with Bradman (89). Australia closed the third day at 343/4 after a productive day of batting, giving them a lead of 478 despite losing three quick wickets late in the afternoon.\nAfter the rest day, Australia proceeded to reach 460/7—Keith Miller making 74—before Bradman declared, setting England a target of 596 midway through the afternoon. The hosts reached 106/3 at stumps on the fourth day, but then collapsed on the final morning to be all out for 186, handing Australia a 409-run victory. Cyril Washbrook and Tom Dollery top-scored for England with 37 apiece. Ernie Toshack had the pick of the figures with 5/40 while Lindwall took 3/61. Although Toshack had the better figures, commentators credited Lindwall with orchestrating the England collapse; at the start of the innings he bowled at leading English batsmen Len Hutton at great pace before dismissing him. Hutton had appeared very unsettled by Lindwall and played meekly. He was severely criticised for his timid manner and was controversially dropped for the following match as the selectors thought he was providing a poor example to the junior members of the team. The Australians were very pleased with this decision, which they believed to be wrong, as they regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent. The match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.\nBackground.\nAustralia had proceeded through the first two months of the tour of England without defeat. After winning 10 of the first twelve matches before the Tests started, eight of these by an innings—the other two were drawn—they won the First Test by eight wickets. Between the Tests, they defeated Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing against Yorkshire.\nAccording to former English paceman Bill Bowes, England had approached the First Test with the intention of achieving a draw against a team they regarded as their superior, reflected in their selections and use of defensive tactics. Bowes himself believed the tactics to be correct and almost successful. However, he suspected that Walter Robins, one of the selectors, considered the English strategy to be misguided and that they should attack the Australians. This was reflected in the English selections. The home team made three changes; the leg spinner Doug Wright, who was forced to withdraw from the First Test at late notice due to lumbago, had regained his fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox spin of Young, who had taken match figures of 1/107 in the First Test—Australian wicket-keeper Don Tallon was his only wicket. However, he had managed to keep the batsmen quiet with his defensive leg theory, bowling 60 overs for 79 runs; Wright was a much more attacking and therefore expensive bowler. Jim Laker, who had been called into the First Test team due to Wright's lumbago, was initially the third spinner in the pecking order, but he took 4/138, including three specialist batsmen, and was retained.\nAlec Coxon took match figures of 4/113 for Yorkshire against Australia, taking four middle-order wickets, and scored 21 and 16 not out in the middle-order. He came into the team as an all-rounder, even though his performances during the rest of the English season had been mediocre; he had a batting average of 20.25 for the summer and took only ten wickets in seven matches prior to the county fixture against Australia. Bowes saw him as an attacking bowler compatible with Robins's strategic thinking.\nTom Dollery was called into the team after a run of heavy scoring for Warwickshire on difficult pitches at Edgbaston. He had made two centuries and seven fifties in 12 first-class matches for the season. Batsman Charlie Barnett was dropped after scoring only eight and six in the First Test. Joe Hardstaff junior was also left out; he had scored a duck and 43 in the First Test, and had a toe infection, so the selectors were spared the predicament of deciding whether to drop him on performance grounds. With Wright in for Young, and Coxon selected in place of a specialist batsman, England had a more attacking bowling line-up, something the retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly praised. He also thought the selection of Coxon was beneficial, as his swing bowling would ease the workload of batsman Bill Edrich, who had opened the bowling in the previous Test. O'Reilly regarded Edrich as a mediocre bowler and thought the extra burden with the ball was detracting from his main duty, batting.\nAustralia retained the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge. Ian Johnson was retained despite taking match figures of 1/85, as was Bill Brown, the opener who was batting out of position in the middle-order. Brown had scored 25, 26 and 17 in his three innings in the middle-order during the tour. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that despite Brown's unbeaten double century in his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey had better claims to selection. Following his groin injury at Trent Bridge, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Before the toss, Bradman had spent an unusually long time inspecting the wicket, and after correctly predicting the side of the coin, he looked at the surface for another period before announcing Australia's decision to bat. The all-rounder Keith Miller played, but was unfit to bowl.\n24 June: Day One.\nAt 8:00 on the morning of the Test, there was a storm to the south of London but the rain did not reach Lord's, which was located in the north of the English capital. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to complete a maiden. The debutant Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and he removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Hutton at short fine leg from a short delivery to leave Australia 3/1. Barnes tried to knock the ball through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton. Coxon bowled from very close to the wickets and left substantial footmarks just outside the right-hander's leg stump in an area ideal for a leg spinner. Although he was not of particularly fast pace, Coxon ran in vigorously and landed heavily after a pronounced delivery stride, making a significant impact on the surface. Bradman received a loud, positive reception from the crowd as he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's.\nBradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving a loud appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling from the other end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and one ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first 20 minutes and Australia had scored only 14 after the first 30 minutes. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.\nEdrich then relieved Coxon, who had bowled his first seven overs in Test cricket for the loss of only 10 runs. Edrich bowled a bouncer, which Bradman tried to swing to the leg side, but the leading edge instead went in the air and landed behind point. On 13, Bradman leg glanced a Bedser ball from his legs, narrowly evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour, he was on 14. Bradman had fallen twice for the leg trap in the previous Test. Bedser continued to the probe the Australian captain with inswingers, trying to extract a lofted leg glance in the vicinity if the waiting Hutton. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scoring many runs from the back cut.\nBedser was relieved after 70 minutes of bowling. The leg spin of Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no-ball that Morris dispatched into the leg side crowd for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. Coxon continued to significantly rough up the pitch outside the right-handed batsman's leg stump, and from the other, Wright was able to extract substantial spin on the first morning of the match, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 82/1 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. The tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries, rather than take risks, and as the Englishmen bowled accurately, the Australians did not score quickly.\nIn the third over after the lunch break, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time in the series by Hutton off Bedser at short fine leg. Hutton had dropped Bradman in the same position when he was on 13. Including a county match against Yorkshire, it was the fourth time Hutton had caught Bradman in the leg trap from a glance. According to O'Reilly, this was evidence that Bradman was no longer the player he was before World War II, as he had been unable to disperse the close-catching fielders by counter-attacking, before eventually being dismissed. O'Reilly said this was the first time Bradman had fallen to the same trap three times in succession.\nHassett came to the crease to join Morris, with the new ball already due. Still using the old ball, Bedser beat Hassett second ball with a delivery that moved back in, but the appeal for lbw was turned down. However, Yardley opted to not take the ball, and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain called for a replacement ball. O'Reilly said the failure to take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a missed opportunity to maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett.\nAfter a slow start, Morris had begun to take control. He drove the ball through the covers and clipped it through the leg side, and reached his century with consecutive boundaries from Coxon soon after the new ball was taken. Former Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton, covering the tour as a newspaper journalist, called it \"a pretty Test century in the grandest of all cricket settings\". The century ended a poor run of form for Morris earlier in the tour, when he had been shuffling uncertainly on the crease without decisively moving forward or back. O'Reilly called it Morris's best Test century to date, as this was the strongest English attack he had faced during his career, and because of the loss of wickets at the other end. O'Reilly said Morris had been disciplined in not playing loose shots outside off stump and missing or edging them, yet still being able to score quickly at every opportunity.\nMorris was out soon after for 105 runs with the score at 166/3, having struck 14 fours and one six. His innings, which was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives, ended when he hit Coxon to Hutton in the gully. Miller came in and Bedser bowled three consecutive outswingers to him. A fourth ball swung the other way, and Miller did not offer a shot, expecting the ball to curve away and miss the stumps. Instead, he was hit in front of the wickets and given out lbw for four. O'Reilly said Miller's display was more akin to that of a tail-end batsman with minimal skill, and blamed his poor form with the bat on an excessive workload imposed on him by Bradman. With two quick wickets, England had put the match back in the balance. Batting out of position in the middle-order, Brown came in at 173/4 and helped Hassett to rebuild the innings. Both scored slowly, averaging more than three and a half minutes for each run. They realised Australia could not afford to lose any more wickets quickly and batted with extreme caution, reluctant even to attack long hops. Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley, who was bowling mainly in order to allow his frontline bowlers to recuperate, broke through his defences with a yorker. The English skipper trapped Brown lbw nine runs later to leave Australia at 225/6. Brown had hit two consecutive half-volleys off his pads through the leg side for four, and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery. However, this third delivery came off the pitch more quickly and beat Brown for pace.\nThis left Johnson and Tallon as the new men at the crease. Johnson struggled to score, while Tallon did so freely in the last hour. Edrich had Johnson caught behind for four to leave Australia at 246/7. Johnson had contributed only four of the 30 runs scored while he was at the crease. Lindwall joined Tallon and the pair survived to the close of play. England were well placed when Australia ended at stumps on 258/7 with Tallon on 25 and Lindwall on 3. Tallon had dominated the scoring late in the day, making 25 of the 33 runs added. Bowes believed that Yardley attacked very well, keeping the pressure on Australia by rotating his bowlers effectively so his three main bowlers were always at the crease. O'Reilly praised Evans's agile display in his stumping attempts as the fastest and best he had seen. The English crowd were optimistic about England's position and some of them immediately camped outside the turnstiles upon leaving the ground. Arlott said England's \"bowlers had done nobly\".\n25 June: Day Two.\nThe next day, the English crowd filled the ground early, anticipating a strong showing from the home team after their promising start on the first day, but Australia's lower order batted their team into control on the second morning. Tallon and Lindwall batted confidently from the start of the play, and the latter hit two cover drives for four from Bedser after the new ball was taken. O'Reilly said Lindwall was playing in the same manner as when he made his maiden Test century in the last Ashes series, but he then played around a straight ball from Bedser, and was bowled for 15 to leave the score at 275/8. Tallon kept on batting in a conventional manner, while Johnston and Toshack played adventurously, registering the highest Test scores of their careers. Both Johnston and Toshack swung hard at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Australia's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston—who scored 29—before becoming Bedser's second victim of the morning, holing out to Yardley for 53. Toshack came out to join Johnston with the score at 320/9 and the last pair put on 30 more runs before the latter was stumped from Wright's leg spin, having overbalanced while leaning onto the front foot and trying to hit a ball for six. The Australians had regained the momentum, adding 92 runs in 66 minutes of hitting in the morning. One sequence of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls being unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers from mishits. Both Johnston and Toshack—not known for their batting ability—played without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck. Yardley was later criticised for not bringing Wright into the attack at an earlier stage, as the Australian tail was dealing efficiently with the English pacemen. Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers, ending with 4/100 from 43 overs, while debutant Coxon took 2/90 from 35 overs. The off spin of Laker was used sparingly, accounting for only seven overs, whereas the part-time medium pace of Edrich and Yardley had combined for 23 overs.\nWashbrook and Hutton then strode to the crease as England faced a short burst of Australian pace before the lunch break. Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after delivering the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over to see if he could lift and bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body would not be able to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.\nAlthough Bradman claimed the exchange had been amicable, others disputed this. Teammate Barnes later asserted that Miller had retorted by suggesting Bradman—a very occasional slower bowler—bowl himself. Barnes said the captain \"was as wild as a battery-stung brumby\" and warned his unwilling bowler that there would be consequences for his defiance. According to unpublished writings in Fingleton's personal collection, Bradman chastised his players in the dressing room at the end of the play, saying \"I'm 40 and I can do my full day's work in the field.\" Miller reportedly snapped \"So would I—if I had fibrositis\"; Bradman had been discharged from the armed services during World War II on health grounds, whereas most of the team had been sent into battle. Miller had crash-landed while serving as a fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force in England and had suffered chronic back trouble ever since.\nWashbrook had been criticised after the First Test for playing aggressively and taking too many risks early in his innings, having fallen twice to attacking shots. He continued to play in a similar way, rather than adopting the traditional opener's strategy of not playing at any ball unless it was going to hit the stumps and waiting for the bowlers to tire. Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight in his fourth over, playing at a ball outside off stump, and ended his pre-lunch spell with 1/7 from six overs, while Johnston accompanied him from the other end. Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down. After lunch, Hutton did the majority of the scoring, before playing outside a Johnson off break on the front foot and being bowled for 20 to leave England at 32/2. The English opener had been uncertain against Johnson's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. Compton came in, having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in the last Test while trying to avoid a bouncer, and Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—with an outswinger for five. Edrich had toiled for 70 minutes in scoring those runs. Dollery came out and played the first ball with his pads before being bowled for a duck from the next delivery. Dollery's bat was still about to start its downward swing towards by the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps. O'Reilly said Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling. This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell by Lindwall that yielded 2/11 as the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his extreme pace. England were 46/4 and Australia firmly in control.\nCompton was joined by his skipper Yardley and after playing defensively for a period, the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs in 100 minutes. After the loss of four quick wickets, the Compton and Yardley elected to not play at any balls that were not on the line of the stumps, and Lindwall and Johnston were taken off to recuperate ahead of the second new ball. Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels. Meanwhile, Johnson and Toshack operated, and the English duo played them cautiously and comfortably. At tea, England had recovered to be 129/4, with Compton on 51 and Yardley 42. The English captain had been particularly successful against Johnson, capitalising on a series of overpitched balls and driving them away for runs. After tea, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball, but the former appeared to be tired and lacking in spirit in his first over. Compton edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller took a low catch, ending his innings for 53. One run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. Evans came to the crease and tried to counter-attack, hitting Lindwall for a boundary past square leg. Johnston then removed Evans for nine, caught by a diving Miller from a swing of the bat wide outside off stump, leaving the hosts at 145/7.\nCoxon and Laker came to the crease and put on a 41-run stand for the eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Coxon hit a catch back to Johnson, ending his first Test innings for 19, and Laker was caught behind from the same bowler, having already been dropped twice in the slips. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 207/9 with Bedser on six and Wright eight, having just avoided the follow on.\n26 June: Day Three.\nOn the third morning, Bedser and Wright survived for 20 minutes, and Lindwall tried to break their resistance by aiming a few bouncers at the former. Bedser eventually inside edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135-run first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70, while Johnson took 3/72 and Johnston 2/43. Toshack was the other bowler used, sending down 18 overs for the loss of 23 runs. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended not to notice his bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried his captain had noticed the injury, but Bradman later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow his paceman to relax. O'Reilly said Lindwall \"bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task ... and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler.\" Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing as to what was coming to them.\nThe weather was fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon. From the second ball of the innings, bowled by Bedser, Barnes got off the mark to avoid his pair. Coxon took the new ball at the other end and Barnes and Morris saw it off. In contrast to their English counterparts, the Australian opening pair took a cautious approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit the stumps and established a solid start for themselves. Yardley then introduced Laker, who induced Morris to hit a ball back down the pitch in the air, but the bowler was slow to react to the possibility of a caught and bowled. According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers would have been able to reach the ball and attempt a catch. Barnes survived a missed stumping opportunity from Laker in the same over when he was on 18; he came down the pitch and the ball bounced out of the footmarks and narrowly missed leg stump, but Evans fumbled it, and it went away for four byes.\nBarnes took advantage of his reprieve to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes in an attempt to disrupt their progress. Wright came on and bowled a no-ball, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. Morris stopped shuffling, while Barnes decided to adopt a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the leg side. He drove Laker into the pavilion and Australia were 73/0 at lunch with Morris on 40 and Barnes 25, an overall lead of 208.\nAfter lunch, Morris was bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a sweep from a long hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the leg trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat three times in a row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the new ball.\nBarnes was also quiet after lunch, and after one long period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing his hand on his chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.\nBarnes lingered for a further ten minutes on 96 before reaching his century with a straight drive from Laker. He had taken 255 minutes and hit ten fours. After registering his century, Barnes became particularly aggressive. Barnes stepped out to attack Laker but missed; luckily for him, Evans failed to collect the ball as it turned down the leg side.\nBarnes dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, including two successive blows over the long on boundary for six, and two fours, and Australia's lead went past the 400 mark with nine wickets still in hand. Yardley then brought on the part-time left-arm unorthodox spin of Compton, and himself, in an attempt to stem Barnes' hitting. The Australian finally fell for 141, caught by Washbrook on the boundary from Yardley. The ball would have gone for another six had it not been intercepted by Washbrook. Barnes had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings. The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to reach 296/2 in minutes, after a 174-run partnership with Bradman. Yardley bowled Hassett for a golden duck off the inside edge, so Miller came to the crease at 296/3 to face Yardley's hat-trick ball. The Australian all-rounder survived a loud lbw appeal on his first ball, denying the English captain his hat-trick. Despite Yardley's failure to complete the hat-trick, he had taken four wickets in the match, and was going through an unusually productive period with his semi-regular bowling. While England's front-line bowlers struggled, Yardley managed 9 wickets at a bowling average of 22.66 for the series. His average was second only to Lindwall among all bowlers, and only Bedser (18) among his players dismissed more batsmen. In contrast, Yardley averaged less than two wickets every three matches throughout his first-class career, at an average above 30. \nBradman was on 89 and heading towards a century in his last Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time courtesy of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but the seamer's leg cutter moved the ball the other way towards the slips and caught Bradman's outside edge. Bedser had dismissed Bradman all four times so far in the Test series. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 after Australia had lost 3/33. The tourists reached stumps at 343 without further loss, Miller striking one six over square leg into the grandstand. He had also offered two chances, but none of the catches were completed. This gave Australia a lead of 478 at the end of the third day, with Miller on 22 and Brown on 7. In all, England had missed seven catches or stumpings. O'Reilly said the loss of three quick wickets in the afternoon was not so much a sign of an English revival but Australian complacency due to the large size of the lead.\n28 June: Day Four.\nAfter the Sunday rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs and six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages, which increased England's chances of saving the game. Just ten minutes after the start of the day's play, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, having advanced Australia to 409/4. Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air; Dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare, but dropped the catch. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 66 runs. During this time, the third new ball became available, but England opted not to use it immediately, as the wet and slippery ground had made it hard for the bowlers to grip the ball or run up to the crease with confidence; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise more control over the ball. However, after a period of using his slower bowlers, Yardley opted to take the new ball, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring. It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration, both players found the new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor. Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly, and drove Bedser for many runs. Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.\nAfter the resumption of play, Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 without adding to his lunch score, ending an 87-run partnership with Miller, and bringing Lindwall to the crease at 416/5. Miller and Lindwall attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller's innings was noted for its driving, and he was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from Laker in pursuit of quick runs. He was followed by Lindwall, who ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary, missed, and was stumped for 25, prompting Bradman to declare with Australia at 460/7 with a lead of 595 runs. The tourists had added 51 runs for the loss of three wickets in approximately an hour's batting after lunch. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each. The Australians had punished the spinners the most, taking more than 3.50 runs per over from each of Wright, Laker and Compton. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match.\nYardley decided to use the medium roller to flatten out the surface, but further showers breathed more life into the pitch, forcing a rain break immediately after the start of England's run chase. The rain immediately stopped after the players returned to the pavilion, but upon promptly returning to the middle, the rain started again. The players returned after 15 minutes and played for approximately half an hour, before Washbrook and Hutton unsuccessfully appealed against the light. Rain then came again for another 40 minutes, which included the tea break. The weather cleared in time for the normal resumption of play at 4:30 after the scheduled adjournment.\nWhen the players returned, Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. However, Washbrook changed his tactics and decided to eschew the hook shot, even allowing some short balls to hit him on the body. Washbrook drove Johnston for three runs and then pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes—who was standing close in at short leg—in the nose. He proceeded to score England's first 16 runs. Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before the English batsman had scored. Johnston usually moved the ball into the right-handed batsmen, but on this occasion the ball went straight on and took the outside of the edge of the bat. Hutton had trouble dealing with Lindwall, and played and missed multiple times in the deteriorating light, hampered by the lack of a sightscreen. Fingleton described it as \"probably Hutton's worst effort in a Test\". In a fidgety display, Hutton played loosely outside the off stump and missed four times in one Johnston over. O'Reilly said Hutton \"seemed to have lost all power of concentration and looked like a man being led to the gallows\", and that he \"was little more than a masquerader compared to the Hutton [of 1938]\". Hutton took 32 minutes of batting to score his first run of the innings.\nHutton and Washbrook took the score to 42, England's highest opening partnership of the series thus far, before the former edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips and was out for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls, and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot. Edrich ducked so low and so quickly that the top of the stumps could often be seen behind his back. Soon after, Toshack removed both Edrich and Washbrook in quick succession to leave England at 65/3. Edrich, having played only one scoring shot in the preceding 20 minutes, edged an overpitched delivery to Johnson low down in the slips, and decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken. The batsman thought he may have hit a bump ball into the ground before it flew to Johnson, but the umpire ruled otherwise and gave him out. Tallon then took a difficult catch to remove Washbrook. Washbrook inside edged a Toshack full toss directly downwards at Tallon's ankle. Bradman described the catch as \"miraculous\" because Tallon had to reach so low, so quickly, in order to take the catch. Up until this point, Washbrook had been beginning to find some fluency and was striking the ball confidently. Arlott speculated that Edrich and Washbrook may have lost concentration after Lindwall was replaced by Toshack, lulled into a false sense of security once Australia's leading bowler was no longer operating. However, Compton and Dollery added 41 in the last 30 minutes to take England to 106/3 at the close of play. Compton was on 29 and Dollery 21. The latter was particularly fluent in scoring on the leg side and he defied the Australian bowlers resolutely. Lindwall was brought back to put pressure on Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance in the second innings.\n29 June: Day Five.\nThe final day started poorly for England; after failing to hit a leg stump full toss for a boundary from the first ball of the day, Compton edged Johnston to a diving Miller at second slip from the second ball of the morning. Compton had aimed a square drive, but the delivery was Johnston's variation ball, which went away instead of into the batsman. It took the outside edge and flew to a diving Miller, who knocked the ball upwards before falling on his back and completing the catch as the ball went down. Compton stood his ground and waited for the umpire to confirm whether Miller had caught the ball cleanly, and was duly given out by the unhesitating official. O'Reilly described Miller's effort as \"perhaps the very best slips catch of the whole series and ... a real match-winner.\" England had lost a wicket without adding to their overnight total.\nYardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack bowled the former for 11. He trapped the new man Coxon two balls later in the same over for a duck, leaving England at 133/6. Coxon shuffled across his stumps and missed his first delivery, which hit him in front of the stumps and prompted a loud lbw appeal, and did the same thing to the next ball. During this spell, Toshack conceded only seven runs from eight overs, but was taken off as Bradman wanted to take the new ball and utilise Lindwall and Johnston. In the meantime, Dollery had continued to bat effectively, watching the ball closely onto his bat, and scoring three leg side boundaries from Johnston's bowling. Eight runs after Coxon's dismissal, Dollery shaped to duck a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Lindwall bowled Laker without scoring later in the same over to leave England at 141/8. Evans continued to resist stubbornly, remaining 24 not out as England were bowled out for 186 to cede a 409-run victory. Johnston had Bedser caught by Hassett for nine before Wright hit Toshack to Lindwall for four.\nToshack ended the innings with 5/40, while Lindwall and Johnston took 3/61 and 2/62 respectively. The dominance of Australia's three-man seam attack was such that the off spinner Johnson bowled only two of the 78.1 overs. Arlott said that while Toshack had the best figures, Lindwall was the pivotal figure. He said that when Lindwall \"so patently disturbed Hutton he struck a blow at the morale of the English batting that was never overcome.\" O'Reilly said England's second innings \"had developed into an undignified scramble\" and had allowed the Australian bowlers to pick up wickets as though they were playing against a weak county team. He blamed the low standards of county cricket for allowing English batsmen to accumulate large tallies of runs easily while not testing them against formidable bowling. O'Reilly said they had become soft after many matches against weak opposition, which had not forced them to concentrate as intensely as they would have had to in Test cricket. The gross attendance was 132,000 and receipts were £43,000—a record for a Test in England.&lt;ref name=\"Allen p136/37\"&gt;Allen, pp. 106–107. A report by R. J. Hayter.&lt;/ref&gt;\nAftermath.\n\"Wisden's\" verdict was that \"this convincing victory confirmed the First Test realisations of Australia's clear superiority at all points. Only on the first day did England provide comparable opposition, and their Selectors must have been very disappointed at the lack of determination by some of the batsmen against an attack again below full strength ... Australia were the better team in batting, bowling, fielding and tactics, but England could not complain of lack of opportunities to wrest the initiative.\" Bowes considered England's attacking policy to be a failure and that, unlike the First Test, \"there were no saving graces.\"\nThe main talking point after the Test was the controversial omission of England's leading batsman Hutton for the Third Test. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the Second Test. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would have a negative effect on the rest of the side—which was not in good batting form—as it was a poor example from a leading batsman. The omission generated considerable acrimony, and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was their most formidable opponent with the bat. Former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, a game in which no other Englishman passed 35, and made 94, 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. Hutton's position was taken by debutant George Emmett, who made only 10 and a duck in a rain-shortened draw, and was subsequently dropped for the Fourth Test.\nHutton's controversial exile thus ended after just one Test. However, both E. W. Swanton and Bill Bowes believed Hutton to be a better batsman once he returned to the side. He and Washbrook put on 168 for the first wicket, the first time England had put on more than 42 for the opening stand during the series, as the hosts went on to make 496, their highest score for the series. The pair added another triple-figure partnership in the second innings. Despite this, Australia's batsmen set a world record by chasing down 404 on the final day to win by seven wickets and take a series-winning 3–0 lead.\nThe events of the Second Test also affected the career paths of other players. England's inability to cut down the Australians resulted in the dropping of three of their bowlers—Wright, Laker and Coxon—after the Lord's Test. Coxon's debut was his only Test match, something believed to be caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There was a story that he punched Compton—whom he disliked and considered self-important—in the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. The match was the last ever Test for Brown, who had struggled out of position in the middle-order, scoring 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. He had scored centuries on his previous Test outings at Lord's in 1934 and 1938, but the third visit proved to be the end of his international career.\nAfter the historic win in the Fourth Test, Australia had five tour matches before the final Test. They won three while two ended in rain-curtailed draws. Australia completed the series in style with an innings victory in the Fifth Test at The Oval to complete a 4–0 result. The Fifth Test was the last international match, and the tourists only had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman's aim of going through the tour undefeated. Apart from two matches that were washed out after Australia had secured first innings leads of more than 200, Bradman's men had little difficulty, winning the remaining five fixtures by an innings. They thus became the first touring Test team to complete an English season undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\"."

        "title": "First Test, 1948 Ashes series",
        "text": "The First Test of the 1948 Ashes series was one of five Tests in The Ashes cricket series between Australia and England. The match was played at Trent Bridge in Nottingham from 10 to 15 June with a rest day on 13 June 1948. Australia won the match by eight wickets to take a 1–0 series lead.\nThe Australians started the match as firm favourites, having won the previous series against England 3–0; in the lead-up to the 1948 series, they had won 10 of their 12 tour matches in England, mostly by large margins. This included a crushing innings defeat in a match over the Marylebone Cricket Club—a team consisting almost entirely of Test-capped and current England players. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a cloudy day. After the first morning was interrupted by inclement weather, the Australian fast bowlers quickly made inroads into the English batting. Despite the loss of leading Australian paceman Ray Lindwall with a groin injury, the hosts had difficulty against his colleagues and fell to be 74 runs for the loss of eight wickets (74/8). However, a rearguard action by tail-enders Alec Bedser and Jim Laker saw England reach 165, Bill Johnston taking five wickets for 36 runs (5/36) for Australia, while compatriot Keith Miller took 3/38. Laker top-scored for the hosts with 63. The tourists then reached 17 without loss by stumps.\nOn the second day, Yardley attempted to slow the Australian batsmen by employing leg theory, a defensive strategy that sought more to contain the opposition than to attack. As England had batted poorly in the first innings, allowing Australia to take the lead quickly, the home team sought to slow the tourists' momentum and force a drawn match. Despite the tactics, Australia reached 293/4 at the end of the day's play, captain Donald Bradman having registered his 28th Test century. Although Bradman and his batsmen made gestures indicating frustration at England's stifling tactics, they remained patient as there was still much time left in the match for them to convert their dominance into a victory. The next morning, Bradman departed for 138, the first in a series of dismissals in the leg trap, but his vice-captain Lindsay Hassett continued, making 137 and putting on a century partnership with Lindwall as Australia were eventually out for 509, giving them a 344-run first innings lead. Laker was the leading bowler, taking 4/138. England reached 121/2 by stumps on the third day, which ended with a hostile crowd reaction to Miller, who bowled a large amount of bouncers at Len Hutton and Denis Compton.\nAfter the rest day, play resumed in poor visibility, with frequent interruptions due to rain and bad light. England's batsmen progressed steadily as Australia struggled in Lindwall's absence, which forced his fellow bowlers to bear a greater workload. Hutton made 74 and Compton batted through the entire day to be unbeaten on 154, with England one run ahead at the close of play, on 345/6. Compton's innings in the difficult conditions was highly praised and his team still had a chance of hanging on for a draw if the lower order could bat for a large part of the final day. The next day, Australia prised out the remaining wickets and England were dismissed for 441, with Compton out for 184 after falling on his stumps. Miller and Johnston had both taken four wickets. Australia then made the 98 runs required for victory with the loss of two wickets; opener Sid Barnes made his second half-century for the match in the pursuit.\nBackground.\nPrior to the First Test, Australia had played 12 first-class matches since arriving in England and starting their campaign in late-April, winning ten and drawing two. Eight of the victories were by an innings, and another was by eight wickets. One of the drawn matches, against Lancashire, was rain-affected, with the first day washed out entirely.\nOne of the tour matches was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which fielded a team composed almost entirely of Test players. In what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests, Australia fielded their full-strength team and won by an innings. The difference in Australia's team for the First Test was the omission of leg spinner Colin McCool, who had been struggling from a torn callus on his spinning finger, which prevented him from bowling long spells. It was thought that Bradman would play another leg spinner—Doug Ring—in McCool's place, but the Australian captain changed his mind on the first morning when rain was forecast. Bill Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket. In previous rain-affected matches on the tour, Johnston had been highly effective, taking match figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively. Bill Brown, the reserve opener, played out of position in the middle-order, as he had against Worcestershire and the MCC. Aside from Brown and Johnston's inclusion, Australia's team was the same as that which started the previous Ashes series in 1946–47, which they won 3–0.\nEngland lost their leg spinner Doug Wright before the match to lumbago, so the off spin of Jim Laker was brought in at late notice. Laker had struggled when he had played for Surrey and the MCC against Australia in the lead-up matches, taking 1/137 and 3/127 respectively. In the MCC match, the Australians had attacked him, taking nine sixes from his bowling in one 82-minute passage of play. Of the team that took to the field for the MCC, Len Hutton, Bill Edrich, Denis Compton, captain Norman Yardley, Laker and Jack Young were also selected for the First Test. Hutton scored 52 and 64 in the MCC match but nobody else managed to pass 26 in either innings. Young had bowled 55.2 overs in Australia's only innings, taking 4/155. Opener Jack Robertson was left out after scoring six and a duck, and Cyril Washbrook, who had played against Australia in the 1946–47 series, partnered Hutton. Joe Hardstaff junior had scored 107 for Nottinghamshire, the only century made against Australia in the lead-up matches, earning himself Test selection. Paceman Alec Bedser did not play in the MCC match, but had been a regular during England's last series against Australia in 1946–47, and had taken 4/104 for Surrey in their match against the tourists. Godfrey Evans, who kept wickets in the previous Ashes series, also gained Test selection. According to former England bowler Bill Bowes, England went into the match with the intention of securing a draw through the selection of defensive bowlers. The home team's bowlers would tie down the Australians, forcing the batsmen to take risks to score runs and thereby increasing the chances of dismissal; however, if rain produced a sticky wicket, the England attack might be able to dismiss Australia relatively easily. As such, England filled their team with batsmen and only played three frontline bowlers, Laker, Bedser and Young, and relied on Yardley, Edrich and Charlie Barnett to support them with their occasion seam bowling. It was speculated that England would use only two specialist bowlers; the all-rounder George Pope was in the squad and it was thought he would be used in place of one of the bowlers, but in the end, he was omitted, as was Reg Simpson. The latter had made 74 and 70 for Nottinghamshire against Australia and had impressed observers with his display, and was made twelfth man.\nBefore the start of the match, much of the attention was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.\n10 June: Day One.\nEngland captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat despite the dull light; Trent Bridge had reputation for being favourable to batsmen, and in the previous Test between Australia and England at the ground in 1938, four Englishmen scored centuries as the hosts made 658, before Stan McCabe of Australia made 232 runs himself. The first innings set the pattern of the series as the English top order struggled against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before lunch on the first day due to inclement weather, and the opening pair of Washbrook and Hutton had to deal with the contrasting bowling actions of Lindwall—with a low, somewhat round-arm action—and Miller, who extracted more bounce from a higher arm at the point of delivery. In the first two overs, the Australian pairing extracted little bounce and it seemed as though the hosts would be in a strong position to make a large score on a placid track if they made a solid start. Lindwall bowled the first ball of the match at a moderate pace, and Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings. Gradually, the Australian bowlers got into their rhythm and began to raise their pace. Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but it bounced before reaching a fielder. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The ball went between bat and pads as Hutton moved forward onto his front foot. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad.\nDuring the lunch interval, heavy rain fell, before the sun began to dry the pitch, making the ball skid through upon England's resumption at 13/1. Miller beat Washbrook's bat twice in one over soon after the resumption, but was unable to extract an edge. Lindwall reached his peak speed and Edrich edged to first slip, where Ian Johnson got both hands to the ball above his head, but failed to hold on. Edrich was on four at the time and this was part of a 20-minute passage of play during which England was unable to score. The next ball from Lindwall, Washbrook was caught on the run by Brown on the fine leg boundary after attempting to hook a bouncer pitched on the line of leg stump. It was to be the first of several times that Washbrook was dismissed while hooking, attracting substantial criticism. Washbrook's fall left England at 15/2 after 41 minutes of batting and brought Compton to the crease to join Edrich. Compton square drove Miller to the boundary for four, which prompted a retaliatory bouncer and a negative crowd reaction. Edrich was not scoring quickly but he defied the bowling of Miller and Lindwall as the English pair took the score to 46. Likewise, Compton was restraining his natural inclination to attack in an attempt to rebuild the innings after the two early wickets. During this period Brown made a series of one-handed run-saving stops in the field. The rain had also softened up the pitch and as a result, the playing surface did not offer much bounce.\nBradman then made a double change and brought on the two left-arm pacemen, Bill Johnston and Ernie Toshack. In his first over, Johnston bowled Edrich with a delivery that knocked the off stump out of the ground as the batsman leaned forward on the front foot. Two balls later, Johnston removed Hardstaff for a duck, caught by Miller in slips after attempting a cut. \"Wisden\" described the catch as \"dazzling\". Miller dived and balanced himself on his spine as he caught the ball heels over head. O'Reilly said: \"Johnston had trimmed and embroidered the efforts of his opening bowlers and had swung the fortunes of the game completely in Australia's favour\".\nBradman then decided to bring Miller back in place of Toshack. Two runs later, Compton was bowled attempting a leg sweep against Miller, his leg stump knocked out of the ground as he moved across his wickets. Five English wickets had fallen with only 48 runs on the board after 100 minutes of play; three batsmen had been dismissed in just ten minutes. O'Reilly said \"There was nothing whatsoever to suggest that the pitch had been instrumental in the English debacle. It was purely and simply an exhilarating display of splendid bowling fit to be classed with any match-winning bowling performance in the story of Test cricket.\"\nThe collapse left Barnett and captain Yardley as the new men at the crease. Both players attacked the bowling but could not get their shots through the field for runs. Soon after, Lindwall was forced to leave the field due to a groin injury and did not bowl again. Barnett hit one four before Johnston bowled him for eight off the inside edge as he leaned onto the front foot. This brought Evans to the crease with the score at 60/6, and he attempted to disrupt the Australians' line and length by counter-attacking with a series of shots in front of the wicket. He drove the ball forward of point to the boundary for four, and was then given two lives. He hit Johnston hard to cover, but the catch went through Bradman for another boundary. The second chance of a catch went through Bradman's hand and struck the Australian captain in the abdomen. However, the missed opportunities cost the tourists little; Evans hit a ball strongly but it was caught at close range at short leg by Morris. Without further addition to the score, Toshack trapped Yardley, who had lingered at the crease for 26 minutes in accumulating three runs, leg before wicket (lbw) with a ball that straightened after pitching, leaving the score at 74/8.\nEngland was facing the prospect of setting a new record for the lowest Test innings score at Trent Bridge, worse than the 112 made by England against Warwick Armstrong's Australians in 1921. However, a late fightback averted the unwanted record. Laker and Bedser, both from Surrey, joined forces and scored more than half of England's total, adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes. Laker's innings was highlighted by hooking and driving, while Bedser defended stoutly and drove in front of the wicket, much to the delight of the Nottingham crowd, who had appeared to have become depressed by the collapse of England's batsmen. At first, Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership between the two bowlers from Surrey—it was thought the Australian captain may have been happy for England to continue batting so his top order would not have to bat in fading light towards the end of the afternoon, but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable. O'Reilly speculated that both players had batted confidently as their home ground in Surrey—The Oval—had a reputation for being batsman-friendly, and that as they would have had to contend with opposition batsmen who had the benefit of consistently favourable conditions, then they should also prepare so they too could capitalise on their opportunities with the willow. According to English commentator John Arlott, the playing surface was easier for batting than it had been at the start of the day, \"but the difference was not such as to cause hesitation in the best batsmen in England\".\nEventually, Australia was forced to take the second new ball, and Bedser was finally removed by Johnston and Miller had Laker caught behind two runs later, ending England's innings at 165. Laker top-scored with 63 in 101 minutes, with six boundaries, having reached his first 50 in only 60 minutes. O'Reilly said \"There was nothing about his batting to suggest that luck was going his way or that he was short of batting experience.\" Johnston ended with 5/36, a display characterised with his accuracy and variations in pace and swing. Miller took 3/38 and a catch, while Lindwall and Toshack took one wicket each. Spin was not used in abundance, as Johnson bowled five overs and Morris three. Following England's struggles in the first innings, many pundits criticised Yardley's decision to bat first.\nAustralia had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play. Barnes made an appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Barnes walked down the pitch and reportedly muttered to umpire Frank Chester in a casual tone \"Eh, the light!\", which allegedly shocked the arbiter. During the previous Ashes series in Australia, Barnes had continuously made time-wasting appeals against the light, which forced cricket administrators to limit the batting team to one appeal; if this was declined it would be up to the umpires to offer an adjournment. Despite the appeal against the light, the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 runs from his two overs. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball bowling of Edrich and Bedser. They reached stumps at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on six. Barnes had been fortunate, edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon, and Yardley's decision to place his bowlers Young and Bedser in that region raised surprise; bowlers tend to lack the agility and reflexes needed for such positions. At this stage, following their tail-end resistance, England were in a good position with runs on the board if rain struck overnight and caused a sticky wicket, forcing the Australians to bat in hostile conditions the following day.\n11 June: Day Two.\nIdeal batting conditions and clear weather greeted the players on the second day. After only four overs had been bowled in total the previous afternoon, Edrich was relieved of the new ball, which was given to Barnett, who accompanied Bedser. Both bowlers swung the ball into the right-handed Barnes and away from the left-handed Morris. Not a frontline bowler, Barnett focused on bowling defensively at medium pace, and the Australians wanted to make a safe start, so they decided to play him watchfully. This prompted some commentators to claim Barnett had allowed the Australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them.\nBarnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the umpire failed to evade a drive from Morris and stopped it with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the ground and handed it to the bowler, prompting a finger-wagging from Chester, to which Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball. Morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, who dropped the catch. The batsman recomposed himself and hit Young's first ball—a full toss—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss. After the wayward start, Young began to bowl with consistent accuracy.\nBarnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled for 31 by Laker after two hours of batting. Morris tried to force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad, and the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Bradman came in and Yardley set a defensive field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The English leader packed the leg side with fielders, including two short legs, and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost inside-edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. With Laker stopping the scoring at the other end, Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes of batting. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. At the other end, Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently as he had done in the past. Barnes then reached his half-century after 135 minutes, pulling Barnett for four, and the Australians passed 100 before lunch after 125 minutes of batting. At the adjournment, the tourists were 104/1.\nThe score had progressed to 121 when Barnes tried to cut Laker, but only edged it onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Umpire Cooke was unsure of whether Barnes had hit the ball into the ground before Evans took the catch, and consulted with Chester, who had been standing at point on the other side of the field, before ruling the batsman out. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck in Laker's next over without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which drifted away and went straight on instead of turning inwards, thereby clipping the outside edge of his bat. The ball flew to slip where Edrich completed the catch. The hard-hitting Miller had come in at No. 4, a position usually occupied by vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, a more sedate batsman, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed.\nLaker to this point had taken 3/22 from 12.4 overs, having also top-scored in the first innings. All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would for most of the day. Brown came in at No. 5, but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and looked unaccustomed to playing in the middle order, but Bradman brought him in ahead of Hassett as the new ball was due and Brown was used to starting his innings against pace bowlers and a new ball. The Australian captain decided to hasten the new ball by using his feet to get to the pitch of the ball to attack the spinners, hitting them through the off side. Yardley removed Laker—who was bowling effectively—from the attack and took the second new ball, bringing back Bedser and Edrich. However, this move backfired as Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes, and in the first 40 minutes after lunch, 43 runs were added. Yardley brought back his two spinners, and Australia passed England's total before the English captain brought himself on to bowl, trapping Brown—who was attempting to push the ball to mid-on—lbw with an off cutter in his first over. This ended a 64-run stand in 58 minutes and Hassett came in at 185/4. The Australian vice-captain came close to being caught when he knocked a ball from Bedser into the air, narrowly evading the grasp of Evans. Following the departure of Brown, the Australian scoring slowed as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once.\nYardley continued to employ a leg side field as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then put his hands on his hips to express his displeasure at England's tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian captain did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. Bradman reached tea on 78, and 55 minutes after the resumption of play, he cover drove Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes. It was his 28th Test century, and his 18th in Ashes Tests. The last 29 runs took 70 minutes to accumulate, and it was one of Bradman's slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets. Nevertheless, Bradman had appeared comfortable after the early stages of his innings, and patiently scored most of his runs between mid-off and mid-on, often from the back foot. After Bradman had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen.\nBradman added a further 30 in the last hour to end with 130. Hassett also batted patiently, with one period of 20 minutes during which his score remained on 30. Australia batted to stumps on the second day without further loss, ending at 293/4, a lead of 128, with Hassett on 41. Young had bowled 32 overs to a leg side field, conceding only 53 runs. Fingleton described the afternoon day's play as a \"very shrewd display of tactics\" and said that although the proceedings and the progress of the Australian batsmen had been slow, they were \"never ... dull\". He added: \"Bradman was on top by virtue of the facts that his side was well ahead of England, his own score was 130 and he was also unconquered.\" However, O'Reilly disagreed and said the Australians had not made enough progress as they should or could have. He said the batsmen failed to capitalise on the fatigue of the bowlers late in the day by not going on the attack in search of quick runs, instead of their \"monotonously dull\" strategy of patient attrition. O'Reilly claimed that in containing the opposition batsmen, the English attack had \"shared the honours of the day with—if they did not actually steal them from—Bradman.\" Bradman and Hassett had made physical gestures indicating their displeasure at England's tactics, but O'Reilly felt Yardley had no choice after his team had squandered the initiative with their poor batting, and claimed it was up to the Australians to turn their advantage into a decisive, match-winning position. Arlott disagreed with O'Reilly, and said Australia \"had time to build ... without risk or hurry on a gentle and accommodating ... wicket. Given a winning opportunity, it is characteristic of the Australians that they will never dissipate it by over-anxiety or by carelessness.\"\nAfter the day's play, O'Reilly—a former teammate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist—consulted Bedser on his use of leg theory. During his career O'Reilly had often attacked leg stump, and had devised a plan to ensnare Bradman.\n12 June: Day Three.\nOn the third morning, amid sunshine, Bradman resumed on 130, before progressing to 132 and becoming the first player to pass 1,000 runs for the English season. The Australian captain was not aware of the reason for the spontaneous crowd applause until being notified by wicket-keeper Evans.\nBedser was bowling and he soon implemented O'Reilly's plans. Hutton was moved from leg slip to a squarer position at short fine leg, around 11 metres from the bat. Two short legs and a mid-on were put in place. Bradman drove Bedser through cover for a boundary, but on the next ball, his innings terminated at 138 when he glanced an inswinger from Bedser straight to Hutton at short fine leg, who caught the ball without having to move. Bradman had batted for 290 minutes and faced 321 balls and as Johnson walked in to replace him with Australia at 305/5, Bedser waved to O'Reilly in the press box. When former Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton—a teammate of both Bradman and O'Reilly who was also working as a journalist—reported what his colleague had done, there was some debate as to whether O'Reilly's actions were treacherous.\nJohnson made 21, including an edge over the slips cordon, before being bowled by Laker. He inside edged the ball onto his foot and it rolled back into his stumps. At the same time, Yardley pinned Hassett down with more leg theory. Laker bowled with one slip, while Young had none and had all of his fielders evenly spread in a circular formation. Tallon came in and took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the left-arm orthodox spin of Young. The scoring was very slow during this passage of play—Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs. Hassett conducted himself in a humorous way, and Arlott said: \"only his grace and concealed humour made his innings tolerable\". He mainly scored from deflections and was for the most part prepared to take his time.\nThe injured Lindwall came out to bat at 365/7 without a runner to join Hassett, and appeared to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty. Hassett, who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the day, swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first six of the match. The Australian vice-captain added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. The tourists were unhurried and remained patient as they had bowled England out quickly on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result with less than half the playing time elapsed.\nAfter the break, Hassett reached his century after 305 minutes of batting, his first in Tests in England. He then accelerated, adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes before being bowled by Bedser, having struck 20 fours and a six. The dismissal ended an eighth-wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall, who was caught by Evans down the leg side four runs later, having scored 42 with seven fours. Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes, batting in a carefree and freewheeling manner, before Bedser trapped Toshack to end the innings at 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead. Australia had batted for 216.2 overs, the longest innings in terms of overs and the highest total in the series. Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his spinners; Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) delivered 60 and 55 overs respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113. The part-time seam bowlers, Edrich, Barnett and Yardley, bowled 18, 17 and 17 overs respectively. Australia had scored slowly but they had no need to take risks when there was so much time remaining. Yardley's leg theory tactics failed to coax them into losing their patience.\nEngland thus started their second innings still 344 runs in arrears. Although Lindwall was able to run between the wickets, he did not take to the field in the second innings and the 12th man Neil Harvey took his place. Fingleton called Harvey \"by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides\". Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but did not formally object to Harvey's presence on the field. O'Reilly said Lindwall had demonstrated his mobility during his innings, was in no way \"incapacitated\" and that the English captain \"must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far\" when no substitute was justified. O'Reilly decried the benefit Australia derived through the substitution, agreeing with Fingleton's judgement of Harvey was the tourists' best fielder by far. Arlott went further, calling Harvey the best fielder in the world.\nFour of the first five runs were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's decision and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat. Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up his end of the pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface.\nThis brought together England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton. The latter, coming in upon the fall of Edrich, ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly play a defensive shot on the run. He clipped the next ball to the leg side for two runs before surviving a confident leg before wicket appeal from Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared ready to walk off, but umpire Chester declined the appeal, much to his surprise. England reached 50 in 65 minutes and with Lindwall missing, Bradman had difficulties in spreading the workload among his depleted bowling resources. The part-time leg spin of Barnes was brought on as the fifth bowling option to give the others some time to rest, and Miller resumed bowling late in the day, delivering slow off spin to conserve energy. Hutton and Compton exploited the depleted bowling attack and began to score freely, using their placement to bisect the gaps between the fielders. The pair did not give a chance apart from when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point.\nHutton then leg glanced Miller, before cover driving and square cutting him in another over. All three shots went for four and he reached his fifty in 110 minutes. Miller responded to the spate of boundaries with a series of bouncers, including five in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd throughout his short-pitched barrage, including shouts of \"Bodyline\". The original practitioners of Bodyline, Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, were both from Nottinghamshire and played at Trent Bridge, and were later excluded from selection for England after being blamed for the ill-feeling caused by Bodyline. The Nottinghamshire supporters were still angry with how their players had been removed and were not happy that Miller was able to do something they saw to be equivalent. For his part, Miller appeared to be amused by the crowd reaction and revelled in it, grinning and flicking his hair. However, Hutton had the last word, glancing Miller down to fine leg for a four from the final ball of the day. England were 121/2, with Hutton and Compton on 63 and 36 respectively. Miller was widely jeered and heckled as he walked off the field, and the crowded surged towards him as he walked up the steps into the dressing room. O'Reilly defended Miller's use of short-pitched deliveries, pointing out that he had not employed a packed leg side field and had allowed the batsman the opportunity to score from hook and pull shots if he was willing to try; in contrast the packed Bodyline field meant batsmen would find little reward for such shots and defensive play would only lead to dismissal.\n14 June: Day Four.\nThe third day was followed by a rest day on Sunday and play resumed on the fourth morning, a Monday, with England still 223 runs in arrears. Before the start of play, the Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club (NCCC) secretary, H. A. Brown, broadcast an appeal to the gallery over the public address system to refrain from their heckling of Miller.\nThe crowd responded by clapping as the Australians took to the field. The chairman of the NCCC reportedly apologised to Bradman in private for the crowd reaction to Miller.\nAs the new ball was due soon after the start of the play, Johnson and Toshack opened the attack as Bradman saved Johnston and Miller. In his first over, Johnson extracted sharp turn from one delivery that pitched outside off stump; not expecting much spin, Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads, but the umpire rejected the loud appeal for lbw. Otherwise, Hutton and Compton progressed steadily before the light deteriorated, although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly. Despite this, Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day as soon as it was available. Mindful of recent events, Miller refrained from bouncers during the morning. In the overcast conditions, Miller bowled a relatively full length and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. At the other end, Johnston was also able to make the ball move sideways. Meanwhile, Compton appeared to be untroubled by the bowling. After half an hour of play, an unsuccessful appeal against the light was made as dark clouds hovered overhead. The rejection of the appeal made little difference, as a thunderstorm stopped proceedings for five minutes soon after. Shortly after the resumption, Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions, ending the 111-run partnership at 150/3. Hutton had made 74 runs in 168 minutes with 11 fours, and as in the first innings, he played forward to a ball without getting his front foot close to the bat, resulting in the delivery moving through the gap into the stumps. The wicket prompted the entrance of Hardstaff, and on the third ball he aimed a cut at a wide Miller delivery, and it again went low to second slip as in the first innings. However, this time Morris was in the position and the catch was dropped. It was part of an eventful over during which Hardstaff had many near-misses. He played and missed at one ball, inside edged another into his pads and edged another through the slips for two runs. Hardstaff had a reputation for being an uncertain starter, especially as he had a tendency to poke at deliveries outside his off stump, and the poor visibility further hindered him.\nAt 12:35, bad light stopped proceedings, and after two inspections the umpires resumed play, although Arlott claimed that visibility was \"barely more than a half candle-power better\". Hardstaff then batted aggressively, walking towards the bowling and hitting three cover drives for four from Miller and Johnston, in one period in which he outscored Compton 23 to four. He then edged through slips for another boundary before Compton swept Toshack to the fence. In the final over before the lunch break, Hardstaff square drove Johnston for four off the back foot and England adjourned at 191/3 with Compton on 63 and Hardstaff 31, still 153 in arrears. During the session, Bradman used Miller for 11 overs in a row in an attempt to pressure the Englishmen, while Toshack bowled defensively from the other end.\nAfter lunch, the light was again poor, but England did not appeal to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor visibility in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress in the hope that the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.\nThe innings was interrupted by bad light and upon the resumption of proceedings, poor visibility intervened for a second time with Compton on 97. After 55 minutes of delay, the umpires called the players back onto the field. \"Wisden\" said: \"rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day.\" Fingleton said the conditions were \"pitiable\" and lamented the \"utmost gloom in which batsmen and fieldsmen had intense difficulty in sighting the ball\". O'Reilly said it was \"without doubt the worst light\" under which he had seen a first-class match proceed. Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge by hitting a single to square leg, a \"lovely century of stroke-play and patience\" according to Fingleton. The innings had taken 227 minutes and included 12 fours, and Compton had regularly hit the ball in the middle of his bat despite the poor visibility, which meant the batsmen could not see the ball once it was close to the boundary. O'Reilly described the innings as \"one of the greatest batting efforts in the story of Anglo-Australian Tests\", adding that \"his hundred runs was but a poor measure by which to estimate the value of his magnificent innings\", deeming Compton's innings equivalent to a double century under normal conditions. Arlott said \"In its manner, its style and its context it must rank with any innings he has ever played ... his innings will remain a Test classic.\"\nSoon after, Compton edged to the slips from the bowling of Miller, but Johnson spilled the catch. Hardstaff fell for 43, lofting Toshack to Hassett on the leg side, having put on 93 with Compton. The ball looped up in the air and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Barnett came in and together with Compton added 21 runs in 33 minutes before edging Johnston to Miller, who completed a difficult catch in slips. Yardley came out to bat at 264/5 and Compton drove Miller square for four, provoking the bowler's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and Miller's next delivery slipped out of his hand and cleared Compton's head on the full to some jeering in the crowd. Such a ball is known as a beamer and is illegal because of the physical danger it poses to the batsman. Compton and Yardley put on a 57-run partnership in 66 minutes before Johnston held a return catch to dismiss Yardley for 22. England reached stumps at 345/6, just one run ahead of Australia, with Compton on 154 and Evans on 10. During the day, Johnston bowled the most overs, 30.\n15 June: Day Five.\nCompton and Evans continued to resist the Australians on the final morning, the latter being the more aggressive, and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes after the start of play. At the time, it appeared the downpour might cause the match to end in a draw. After half an hour of stoppages, play resumed and Evans attacked, hitting two fours in quick succession. England's wicket-keeper played Johnston and Johnson confidently, but Bradman nevertheless persisted in giving Compton easy singles in order to bring Evans on strike so he could be targeted. For his part, Compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted the runs gifted to him by the Australian captain, while Evans continued to attack the bowling. The batsmen appealed against the light after the first stoppage of the day, but were turned down. Australia took the new ball, but the home team's batsmen continued to proceed steadily, Evans being particularly aggressive. After a second interruption for poor light, this time for ten minutes, play resumed, and England had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405/6.\nMiller bowled a fast and very short bouncer at Compton, who moved into position to hook before changing his mind and attempting to evade the ball. He lost balance and threw his legs apart, trying to avoid stepping onto his stumps. However, he was unsuccessful and was out hit wicket for 184, having batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours. \"Wisden\" said: \"No praise could be too high for the manner in which Compton carried the side's responsibilities and defied a first-class attack in such trying circumstances.\" Fingleton said it was \"a most depressing end to an innings that will live always\". O'Reilly described it as \"an unsavoury ending to one of the greatest fighting knocks in Test history\". Compton's fall at 405/7 exposed the English tail and Australia quickly finished off the rest of the batsmen in 36 minutes. Miller bowled Laker—who played outside the line of the ball—for four, Evans reached 50 and was caught behind from Johnston, who then castled Young for nine. England were all out for 441 after 183 overs, leaving Australia a target of 98 in three hours. Lindwall's absence throughout the England innings meant the remaining four Australian frontline bowlers had bowled more than 32 overs each—Johnston delivered 59 and ended with 4/147 while Miller took 4/125 from 44 overs. Toshack and Johnson took a wicket each from 33 and 42 overs respectively.\nAustralia progressed quickly at the start of the chase. Barnes took 13 runs, including three boundaries, from the opening over, bowled by Bedser, while Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. Yardley tried to stop the run-scoring by bringing on Young, but Morris hit him for four and the bowler was promptly taken off. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Bedser bowled Morris for nine; after bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger. Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch. Bradman came to the crease and batted for 12 minutes without getting off the mark. From the 10th ball he faced, the Australian skipper was out for a duck, again caught by Hutton at short fine leg in Bedser's leg trap. Bradman showed obvious displeasure at allowing himself to be dismissed by the same trap in consecutive innings, and his departure left Australia at 48/2. It was the first time in four tours to England that Bradman had made a duck in a Test.\nUpon Bradman's dismissal, dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. Barnes gave Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. The pair reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries, having been prolific on the square cut. He tied the scores with a swept boundary, and having taken a stump as souvenir, ran off the ground believing the match was over. Barnes tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and Hassett promptly hit the winning run.\nAftermath.\nThe First Test was a continuation of the trend of English batsmen being largely unable to cope with Australia's pacemen. Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match, and at Trent Bridge only he and Compton managed this feat. Apart from Hardstaff, none of the remaining batsmen passed 25. \"Wisden's\" verdict was that England fought back very well, but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on the first day. Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display worthy of a draw, and blamed the first innings batting for the failure to prevent defeat. However, he believed the English tactics to be justified and should have been continued.\nAustralia's success came at a cost, with Lindwall injured and unable to bowl in the lead-up to the Second Test, missing the intervening matches against Northamptonshire and Yorkshire. The heavy workload on Miller caused by Lindwall's breaking down mid-Test generated severe back pain, and he was still not fully recovered by the start of the Second Test at Lord's. Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning of the Lord's Test. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to risk his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Miller also played, but still nursing his back, was unfit to bowl.\nContent with their convincing win at Trent Bridge, Australia made no changes to their team, while England made three, omitting Barnett, Hardstaff and Young due to a combination of injury and poor form. Barnett and Hardstaff never played another Test. Despite his injury, Lindwall played a key role in a heavy 409-run Australian victory, taking eight wickets. His bowling also led to the controversial omission of Hutton, who performed poorly at Lord's, for the Third Test. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. This decision pleased the Australians, who regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent with the bat.\nOn the field, the Australians continued to flourish. The Third Test was a rain-affected draw, and between the First and Fourth Tests, they won four of their five county matches, drawing the other. On the final day of the Fourth Test, Australia's batsmen set a world Test cricket record by scoring 404 to win the match, thereby taking a series-winning 3–0 lead.\nAfter the historic win in the Fourth Test, Australia had five tour matches before the final Test. They won three while two ended in rain-curtailed draws. Australia then completed the series with an innings victory in the Fifth Test at The Oval to complete a 4–0 result. The Fifth Test was the last international match of the tour, and the tourists had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman's aim of going through the English season undefeated. Apart from two washed-out matches, Bradman's men had little difficulty, winning the remaining five fixtures by an innings. They thus became the first touring Test team to complete an English season undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\"."

        "title": "John Scott (ice hockey, born 1982)",
        "text": "John Howard Scott (born September 26, 1982) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman and winger. A professional player for nearly 10 seasons, Scott saw National Hockey League (NHL) action with the Minnesota Wild, Chicago Blackhawks, New York Rangers, San Jose Sharks, Buffalo Sabres, Arizona Coyotes and Montreal Canadiens. Scott was born in Edmonton, Alberta, but grew up in St. Catharines, Ontario. He graduated from Michigan Technological University in 2006.\nScott gained prominence in January 2016 when, after an online campaign, he was named captain of the Pacific Division team for the 2016 NHL All-Star Game, despite only having scored five goals in his career, and only one assist in his time with the Coyotes. Despite a trade to the Montreal Canadiens, and subsequently being sent down to the St. John's IceCaps, then the Canadiens' AHL affiliate, the NHL confirmed on January 19, 2016, that Scott would participate in the 2016 NHL All-Star Game as the captain of the Pacific Division. Scott scored two goals in the tournament that helped his team advance to the finals where they were winners by a score of 1–0, and was voted the Most Valuable Player.\nA film based on Scott's final professional season and the events surrounding his All-Star appearance is currently in development.\nPlaying career.\nWhile growing up in Ontario, Scott was a Boston Bruins fan and decided to be a defenceman following Ray Bourque. Undrafted, Scott committed to a four-year collegiate hockey career with Michigan Tech in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association, hoping to at least have a degree if his hockey career did not pan out. As an enforcing physical defenceman, Scott recorded 19 points with 347 penalty minutes in his time with the Huskies. Prior to his senior year, Scott was involved in an automobile accident while driving under the influence; he was convicted and spent an unspecified amount of time in jail.\nA free agent, Scott joined the Houston Aeros of the American Hockey League in 2006. During his first professional season in 2006–07 he was signed by the Minnesota Wild to an entry-level contract. The first time he was called up, he was unable to play in the game because it was against the Maple Leafs in Toronto, and he did not have his passport. His first NHL game came one month later in Detroit against the Red Wings. In the 2009–10 season Scott scored his first NHL goal on November 15, 2009, against Michael Leighton of the Carolina Hurricanes in a 5–4 shoot out loss.\nOn July 1, 2010, Scott left the Wild as a free agent and signed a two-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks.\nIn the second year of his contract in the 2011–12 season, Scott was dealt at the trade deadline to the New York Rangers for a fifth-round draft pick in 2012 on February 27, 2012.\nOn July 1, 2012, Scott agreed to terms on a one-year deal with the Buffalo Sabres. On May 20, 2013, the Sabres re-signed Scott to a one-year contract extension worth $750,000.\nOn October 31, 2013, Scott was suspended seven games for an illegal check to the head of the Bruins' Loui Eriksson a week prior.\nOn July 2, 2014, Scott signed as a free agent to a one-year contract with the San Jose Sharks.\nOn October 26, 2014, against the Anaheim Ducks, Scott was subbed in via legal line change, and immediately began fighting Tim Jackman without attempting to play the puck, though head coach Todd McLellan stated Scott had already been on the ice at the time, and the fight escalated into a line-brawl. The next day, he was suspended for the next two games; it was officially recorded as for \"leaving the bench on a legal line change and starting an altercation\". According to the NHL's Department of Player Safety video, Scott said he left the bench with the desire to fight Jackman. On December 24, Scott was suspended for four games as \"punishment for punching an unsuspecting opponent and causing an injury\" on December 22 according to the NHL's Department of Player Safety. The punch/hit with stick was, again, on Jackman.\nOn July 10, 2015, Scott signed a one-year contract with the Arizona Coyotes.\nAll-Star season.\nIn the 2015–16 season, on January 2, 2016, Scott was announced as the winner of the NHL All Star Game fan vote, as the captain for the team representing the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. Scott received the most votes of any player, despite having only recorded one point in 11 games played with the Coyotes (Scott spent much of the season as a healthy scratch) and scoring five goals in his entire career up to this point. The situation was compared to Rory Fitzpatrick's All-Star campaign in 2007, in which fans vote for a player who would not conventionally be chosen as an All-Star to highlight a role player.\nThe Sports Network (TSN) analyst Bob McKenzie reported that the NHL and the Coyotes had requested that Scott remove himself from the All-Star team. After being advised of the campaign, Scott made a statement to NHL fans, saying \"Listen. I don't deserve this. Vote for my teammates.\" After he was declared the winner of the fan vote, Scott decided that he would play in the game.\nOn January 15, Scott was traded to the Montreal Canadiens along with Victor Bartley for Jarred Tinordi and Stefan Fournier. After Scott was traded, the Canadiens sent him down to their then American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the St. John's IceCaps. Arizona's general manager Don Maloney insisted the trade was a business move, and not an attempt at keeping Scott out of the All-Star Game. Speculation surfaced that Scott was potentially to be ruled ineligible to be on the All-Star team because of his move to an AHL roster and to an NHL team in the Atlantic Division. On January 19, Scott was officially declared by the NHL to be the captain of the Pacific Division roster at the 2016 All-Star Game. Scott later penned an article for \"The Players' Tribune\", entitled \"A Guy Like Me\", in which he stated the NHL tried to persuade him not to play in the game.\nDuring the All-Star Game, Scott scored two goals in the semifinal of the tournament to propel his team into the final—which the Pacific Division ultimately won, and was named All-Star Game most valuable player, despite not being included in the voting. When he was excluded, fans (including players such as Henrik Lundqvist and official team accounts for the Ottawa Senators, Philadelphia Flyers, Vancouver Canucks, and Edmonton Oilers among others) took to Twitter with the hashtag #VoteMVPScott. Faced with this overwhelming support, the NHL awarded Scott the title. Following the All-Star Game and Scott's election to MVP, the NHL amended its rule book to disqualify players from being named All-Star captains if they are injured or moved to the AHL.\nScott's helmet at the All-Star game was sent to the Hockey Hall of Fame, and Scott's agent was approached about a film based on Scott's career as well as several endorsement deals.\nOn April 3, Scott was called up from the St. John's IceCaps by the Canadiens. It was his first time back in the NHL since December 31, 2015. On April 5, Scott played in his first NHL game with the Canadiens, where he had three shots, seven hits, and two penalty minutes. Directly after the game he was given the option to return to St. John's to finish the season or return to Michigan to see his family for the first time in nearly two months. Scott returned home, ending his season.\nOn December 7, 2016, Scott announced his retirement from ice hockey in a \"Players' Tribune\" article titled \"Five Goals, Four Kids, One Hell of a Good Time\".\nPersonal life.\nScott has a mechanical engineering degree from Michigan Technological University, where he played college hockey with the Michigan Tech Huskies. Sidelined by his career, Scott completed his degree program in 2010. He still has a home in Traverse City, Michigan. Scott and his wife, a fellow Michigan Tech student who graduated in biomedical engineering, have seven daughters, including a set of identical twins who were born a week after his All-Star Game appearance.\nScott's autobiography, \"A Guy Like Me: Fighting to Make the Cut\", was released December 27, 2016. In 2017, he was baptized as a Catholic and discusses this, among other things, in his podcast.\nIn the media and legacy.\nAfter taking the ice hockey world by storm as a write-in for the All Star Game captaincy, Scott was discouraged from participating by the NHL yet ultimately took part and was chosen as the MVP after winning the tournament. Following the game, it was reported that Mandalay Sports Media acquired the rights to create a movie about the enforcer. The film script will be written by Mitch Albom, who is a sportswriter for the Detroit Free Press and a regular on ESPN's Sports Reporters and SportsCenter. He has written three movies, four plays and seven books but explained that each project is different. According to Albom, Scott's story is comparable to that of the fictional Rocky Balboa. As of February 2019, Scott has confirmed that casting has almost concluded. \nIn May 2019, Scott confirmed on the Barstool Sports podcast Spittin' Chiclets with Paul Bissonnette and Ryan Whitney that both Hugh Jackman and Will Arnett were in discussions to star in the film. Da Beauty League, a recreational summer ice hockey league that features numerous NHL stars, named its championship cup the \"John Scott Cup\" and awarded Scott an honorary commissioner position in the league. The league's logo is a silhouette of Scott.\nIn November 2017, Scott appeared in an episode of the TV series \"S.W.A.T.\" called \"Imposters\"; he portrayed Bobby Strock, an ice hockey player who needs protection from the show's protagonists after receiving death threats for injuring a popular hometown player on a dirty hit.\nIn January 2019, \"Radiolab\" released a podcast about Scott and his All-Star Game appearance titled \"The Punchline\".\nIn October 2023, Scott joined NBC Sports Chicago as a studio analyst for Chicago Blackhawks pre- and postgame shows."

        "text": "Brian Delance Johnson (born February 16, 1987) is an American football coach and former quarterback who is the assistant head coach and offensive pass game coordinator for the Washington Commanders of the National Football League (NFL). He has been an offensive coordinator for Utah, Houston, and Florida of the NCAA and the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL. Johnson played college football at Utah and was drafted by the New York Sentinels in the UFL Premiere Season Draft in 2009.\nEarly life and high school.\nJohnson was born on February 16, 1987, in Barrett Station, Texas. He attended Robert E. Lee High School, where he lettered in football and basketball. During his senior year in 2003, in which he took over starting quarterback duties from Drew Tate, Johnson passed for 2,900 yards and 33 touchdowns and rushed for 540 yards with 12 touchdowns. Johnson was named the district's Most Valuable Player, first-team all-district, and second-team all-state. After graduating early, Johnson was a two-star recruit coming out of high school, not being ranked among the top quarterback prospects of his class. Johnson was recruited by Utah, Illinois and Louisiana Tech.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nJohnson played college football for the Utah Utes. As a true freshman in 2004, Johnson saw action in ten games as back-up to Heisman Trophy finalist Alex Smith. He passed for a touchdown and ran for another, while he compiled a 129.7 passer rating.\nIn 2005, Johnson took over as starting quarterback, where he remained for the first ten games until a season-ending knee injury against New Mexico on November 12. He finished the season with 2,892 passing yards and 18 touchdowns. Against Wyoming, he was named the Mountain West Conference (MWC) Offensive Player of the Week for completing 32-of-45 passes for 384 yards and four touchdowns, while rushing for 67 yards and a touchdown. He was first in the MWC and fourth nationwide in total offensive yards with an average 337.0 yards per game, and second in the MWC in passing yardage with 289.2 yards per game. The Utes' record with Johnson at quarterback in 2005 was 5–5, before ultimately finishing the season 7–5.\nAfter undergoing surgery on December 1, 2005, to correct his knee injury, Johnson redshirted his third year in order to convalesce during the 2006 season. In 2007, Johnson returned to see action in 11 games, ten of which he started. In the first game of the season against Oregon State, he injured his shoulder and subsequently missed two following games. He finished the season with 2,636 passing yards and 24 touchdowns. In the 2007 Poinsettia Bowl against Navy, Johnson completed 20-of-25 passes for 226 yards and a touchdown, while he rushed for 69 yards and one touchdown. For his performance, he was named the 2007 Poinsettia Bowl's Most Valuable Player.\nIn 2008, Johnson returned for his final season as the Utes' starting quarterback. In the first game against Rich Rodriguez's Michigan, he threw for 305 yards in Utah's 25–23 win. They went on to compile wins against Air Force, Oregon State (who defeated USC the previous week), and twelfth-ranked TCU, a team that only had one other loss in the season (against future BCS Championship Game participant second-ranked Oklahoma.) In their final regular season game against fourteenth-ranked BYU, Johnson threw for 303 yards and four touchdowns in a 48–24 victory. Utah's performance secured the sixth rank in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) poll, and they became the only BCS non-AQ conference team to secure a berth in a BCS game (the 2009 Sugar Bowl, against Southeastern Conference (SEC) Western Division champions Alabama.)\nIn the Sugar Bowl, Johnson led seventh-ranked Utah with 336 passing yards and three passing touchdowns in a 31–17 surprise upset over fourth-ranked Alabama. For his performance, Johnson was named the 2009 Sugar Bowl's Most Outstanding Player. Utah finished the season as the only undefeated team, with a 13–0 record. Johnson was featured as the cover athlete of the PlayStation 3 edition of the \"NCAA Football 10\" video game.\nJohnson's record as a starting quarterback in his career at Utah was 26–7, which made him the winningest quarterback in school history.\nProfessional.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2009 NFL Draft, he was invited to the Green Bay Packers' rookie mini-camp, along with Tulsa quarterback David Johnson. He was not signed by an NFL team, but the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League were reportedly interested in him.\nJohnson was selected in the inaugural United Football League (UFL) draft by the New York Sentinels. Johnson had said at UFL tryouts, \"It's a chance to keep playing football ... You have to take every opportunity you can get. You have to keep knocking on doors. You have to show them you can compete, that you have the physical tools they want.\" He signed with the team on August 5, 2009, but was released on September 28.\nCoaching career.\nUtah.\nIn January 2010, at 22 years of age, Johnson was named the quarterbacks coach at the University of Utah by head coach Kyle Whittingham. On February 2, 2012, two weeks before his 25th birthday, Johnson was named offensive coordinator at Utah by Whittingham.\nMississippi State.\nOn February 10, 2014, Johnson was named as the quarterbacks coach at Mississippi State, reuniting him with coach Dan Mullen. Mullen had offered him a scholarship to sign with Utah during Urban Meyer's tenure as the Utes' head coach.\nHouston.\nOn December 27, 2016, Johnson was hired as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Houston.\nFlorida.\nOn December 10, 2017, Johnson was hired as the quarterbacks coach at the University of Florida, once again reuniting with head coach Dan Mullen. Johnson was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2020, making him the first African-American offensive coordinator in the team's history.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nOn January 27, 2021, Johnson was hired by the Philadelphia Eagles as their quarterbacks coach and wide receivers coach under head coach Nick Sirianni. Johnson was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2023, replacing Shane Steichen who departed to become head coach of the Indianapolis Colts. Johnson's playcalling was criticized throughout the season, with him being fired following the season.\nWashington Commanders.\nOn February 15, 2024, Johnson was hired by the Washington Commanders as their assistant head coach and offensive pass game coordinator under head coach Dan Quinn."

        "text": "Thomas Gerard Phillips (April 5, 1889 – April 12, 1929) was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played for four seasons. He played for the St. Louis Browns in 1915, the Cleveland Indians in 1919, and the Washington Senators from 1921 to 1922. In 1922, Tom Phillips played baseball in the American Association for the Minneapolis Millers. Manager Joe Cantillon led the Millers to a record of 92-75 to earn Second Place. Phillips's stats for 1922 are: 21 Games Played; 143 Innings Pitched; 9 Games Won; 7 Games Lost; and his Earned Run Average was 4.47. \nIn 1923, again with Manager Joe Cantillon, the Millers's record was 74-92 to earn Sixth Place. Phillips's stats are: 12 Games Played; 74 Innings Pitched; 4 Games Won; 4 Games Lost; and his Earned Run Average was 5.06. That year, Phillips hit 4 Home Runs and his RBI was 5.06. (Stats from Stew Thornley, author of On to Nicollett: The Glory and Fame of the Minneapolis Millers.) . \nPhillips was well over six-feet tall, hence the nickname \"Big Tom Phillips.\" The family considers him a hero as he was the first to make it \"out of the mines.\" Although he never married, several relatives have been named \"Thomas\" in his honor.\nAccording to an April 12, 1929 newspaper obituary clipping found on the back of a family portrait: \"He broke into professional baseball with Wilkes-Barre in 1914, where his work attracted Connie Mack. During his best years he was a member of the [Philadelphia] Athletics, St. Louis [Browns], Cleveland [Indians] and Washington [Senators] in the American League. He was also with Little Rock and New Orleans of the Southern Association, pitching the latter team to a pennant in 1924. In 1925 Washington sent him to Minneapolis. The Millers recently sent him to Des Moines, in the Western Association, while he was ill at home in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania. He was about 38 years of age, and had lived here nearly all of his life. His best feat was a no-hit, no-run game while with New Orleans in 1924.\n\"Tom Phillips, former big league pitcher, died at the Philipsburg state hospital here today after a lingering illness from diabetes. He had recently returned from Hot Springs, where he had spent the winter in hopes of regaining his health.\""

        "title": "Tommy Moore (baseball)",
        "text": "Tommy Joe Moore (July 7, 1948 – November 16, 2017) was an American professional baseball pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB), in parts of four seasons between 1972 and 1977.\nEarly years.\nFresh out of John Glenn High School in Norwalk, California, Moore was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 28th round of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. Seven months later, while a student at Cerritos College, the New York Mets drafted him in the tenth round of the January 1967 Secondary draft, and he signed.\nWhile a student at Cerritos, Moore toiled around in the lower levels of the Mets' farm system, going 14-18 with a 3.59 earned run average (ERA) until he had a standout season with the Mets' triple A affiliate, the Tidewater Tides. Moore went 11-5 with a 2.80 ERA to earn a September call-up to the big league club.\nMajor league career.\nNew York Mets.\nMoore made his Major League debut in \"mop up duty\" following a poor outing by Gary Gentry. With the Mets already trailing 6-0 to the Chicago Cubs, he took the mound in the third inning. Moore successfully stopped the bleeding until the sixth inning. With one out, Billy Williams hit a home run. The next two batters followed with a double and a triple. A sacrifice fly and a ground out to the pitcher later, Moore escaped the inning a single shy of giving up a cycle. He was far more successful in his second appearance, when he pitched two innings against the Pittsburgh Pirates, and only surrendered one single. Moore made his first start on October 2, and was in line for the 1-0 win when he exited the game in the eighth inning with one out, and runners on first and third. Former minor league teammate Ken Singleton, now with the Montreal Expos, drove in the tying run to give Moore the no-decision.\nMoore spent most of with Tidewater, with the exception of a brief call-up in May for the injury-riddled club. He suffered his first career loss against the San Francisco Giants in his last outing before returning to Tidewater. He spent the entire season at Tidewater. \nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nMoore was traded along with Ray Sadecki from the Mets to the St. Louis Cardinals for Joe Torre on October 13, 1974. Cardinal manager Red Schoendienst did not seem to have much faith in Moore, as he was used strictly in mop up duty for the entirety of his two month stay with the club. Despite a respectable 3.86 ERA posted during his tenure in St. Louis, every time he was called upon to pitch, the Redbirds were already losing, and usually by several runs.\nTexas Rangers.\nMoore was sent along with Ed Brinkman from the Cardinals to the Texas Rangers for Willie Davis on June 4, 1975. He had a similar role in Texas; however, after pitching innings over five appearances, and only allowing one earned run, he was given more responsibility. Moore entered a save situation on July 28, but was unable to convert, and ended up being credited with the loss. A week later, despite pitching well, he suffered a hard luck loss on his record against the California Angels, and once again found himself in mop up duty for the remainder of the season. Moore spent all of with the Rangers' triple A affiliate, the Sacramento Solons.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn October 24, 1976 Moore‘s contract was purchased by the expansion Seattle Mariners. His first appearance for the M's came on April 8, with the opportunity to save the franchise's first win. Ineffectiveness and sloppy play on the field prevented that from happening; however, Seattle did manage to mount a comeback in the ninth inning for the historic victory. On April 13, Moore earned his first career win. He entered an extra innings game against the Minnesota Twins with the bases loaded, and only one out. Moore retired the next two batters to end the threat, and pitched two more scoreless innings. In the bottom of the thirteenth, Steve Braun drove in Larry Milbourne with the winning run for the Mariners.\nMoore lost his only start with Seattle. Facing the Twins, he only allowed two hits through his first four innings. Moore then allowed a lone run in each of the fifth and sixth innings, before the wheels fell off in the seventh. On May 12, he earned his second, and final, career win, by defeating the New York Yankees. Moore would make just one more appearance before spending the rest of the season in the minors.\nMoore was dealt along with Carlos López from the Mariners to the Baltimore Orioles for Mike Parrott at the Winter Meetings on December 7, 1977, but he was cut during Spring training . Through four MLB seasons, his career statistics posted include making 42 game appearances, going 2-4, with 40 strikeouts, 40 walks, and a 5.40 ERA, in 88 innings pitched."

He played an average of 14:43 in 69 games, netting 13 goals and 14 assists. Following the 2014–15 NHL season Johansson became a restricted free agent under the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Washington Capitals made him a qualifying offer to retain his NHL rights and, on 5 July 2015, Johansson filed for Salary Arbitration.\nNew Jersey Devils (2017–2019).\nWith the Capitals facing cap constraints, on 3 July 2017, Johansson was traded to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for second and third round picks in 2018. On 5 July 2017, the Devils announced that Johansson would become the second player in team's history to wear a number in the 90–99 range after he chose to wear number 90 on his uniform.\nBoston Bruins (2019).\nDuring the 2018–19 season, while in his final year under contract and with the Devils out of playoff contention, Johansson was dealt at the trade deadline on 25 February 2019, to the Boston Bruins in exchange for a second round pick in 2019 and a fourth round pick in 2020.\nJohansson would find chemistry with Bruins forwards Charlie Coyle and Danton Heinen on the Bruins' third line during the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. Johansson and the Bruins would make it all the way the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated by the St. Louis Blues in seven games.\nBuffalo Sabres (2019–2020).\nOn 6 July 2019, the Buffalo Sabres signed Johansson a two-year, $9 million contract. In his lone season with the club, he recorded 30 points in 60 games.\nMinnesota Wild (2020–2021).\nOn 16 September 2020, Johansson was traded to the Minnesota Wild in exchange for Eric Staal.\nSeattle Kraken (2021–2022).\nOn 6 August 2021, Johansson was signed as a free agent to a one-year, $1.5M contract with expansion club, the Seattle Kraken. Johansson began the Kraken's inaugural 2021–22 season, on the injured-reserve. In returning to health, Johansson appeared in 51 regular season games, posting six goals and 23 points.\nReturn to Washington (2022–2023).\nOn 21 March 2022, with the Kraken out of playoff contention, Johansson was traded by the Kraken back to the Washington Capitals in exchange for forward Daniel Sprong, a 2022 fourth-round pick, and a 2023 sixth-round pick. The Kraken retained 50 percent of Johansson's $1.5 million cap hit.\nSecond stint with Minnesota (2023–present).\nDuring the 2022–23 season, on 28 February 2023, Johansson was traded by the Capitals back to the Wild, in exchange for a third-round pick in 2024.\nInternational play.\nJohansson first represented Sweden with the nation's under-18 team at the IIHF World U18 Championship, recording four assists and a plus-minus rating of +5 in six games. The Swedes defeated Canada 8–3 in the bronze medal game. Johansson was again selected for Sweden's under-18 team in the IIHF World U18 Championship. In six games, he scored three goals, provided two assists and was a +3 as Sweden advanced to the bronze medal game for the second-straight year, but was beaten out by the United States, 6–3.\nJohansson then played for the Swedish junior team at the 2009 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, scoring two goals and finishing +5 in six games as Sweden reached the tournament final before falling to Canada, 5–1. Johansson served as captain of the Sweden for the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, scoring one goal providing five assists and posting a +7 plus-minus rating. In the third period of a game against the United States, Johansson received a game misconduct for elbowing forward Jerry D'Amigo, resulting in an automatic suspension for Sweden's bronze medal game with Switzerland, which Sweden ultimately won.\nIn 2014, Johansson was selected for the senior Swedish team to participate at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, where the \"Tre Kronor\" finished with a silver medal after falling to Canada in the final, 3–0. He finished with one assist in the tournament off of an Alexander Edler goal against Latvia."

        "text": "The 2008–2009 Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team represented the University of Maryland in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I competition as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The Terrapins qualified for the NCAA tournament for just the second time since the 2003–04 season. Maryland advanced to the second round before being eliminated by second-seeded Memphis. This exceeded expectations for the team, which had been described as a team that was small in stature without any highly touted athletes.\nSeason recap.\nDuring the season, head coach Gary Williams came under fire for his alleged failure to find consistent success since Maryland won the national championship in 2002. At one point, he and an athletics department official argued publicly over the failure to secure recruit Tyree Evans and the transfer of Gus Gilchrist, two highly touted local players. Athletic director Deborah Yow responded to the situation by vowing support for Williams and ensured her intent to honor his current contract. Soon after, \"The Washington Post\" published a three-part feature on Maryland basketball that was critical of Gary Williams.\nEarly in the season, a lightly regarded Maryland team convincingly upset over fifth-ranked (and eventual national championship runners-up) Michigan State, 80–62, in the Old Spice Classic. Shortly thereafter, they defeated Michigan in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge. They then extended their winning streak to seven and appeared destined to win out in their non-conference schedule, which would have weighed heavily in their favor for an NCAA tournament bid. However, in their final out-of-conference game, they suffered an upset against Morgan State, 66–65.\nAfter a 2–2 start to their conference schedule, which included an overtime loss to Florida State, second-ranked Duke routed the Terrapins, 85–44, in what was Maryland's worst-ever ACC loss. Late in the season, Maryland recovered to \"stun\" third-ranked North Carolina in overtime, and point guard Greivis Vasquez recorded the first triple-double by a Terrapin since 1987. Maryland then lost closely contested games against seventh-ranked Duke and tenth-ranked Wake Forest.\nMaryland entered the ACC tournament needing a significant run to salvage hopes for a bid to the NCAA tournament. The Terrapins won in the first round against NC State and advanced to the quarterfinals, where they won a convincing victory over Wake Forest, 75–64. In the semifinals, they lost a hard-fought game against eventual conference champions, Duke, who had enjoyed a bye in the first game.\nHaving exceeded expectations in the ACC tournament, Maryland was awarded a bid to the NCAA tournament with a seed ranking of ten. In the first round, they played seventh-seeded California, where, after a near stalemate in the first half, Maryland pulled away in the second to win, 84–71. They then faced second-seeded Memphis, which held a 26-game winning streak.\nBefore the game, Memphis reserve forward Pierre Henderson-Niles said about Maryland, \"We really ain't talked too much about Maryland. We watched a little film on 'em one time, and I know they got a good player—I don't know his name—but he good or whatever, so we just going to try to do what we do and stop him. I ain't never seen them; I know they got one good player, Sanchez or something like that, whatever his name is.\" Greivis Vasquez, the outspoken Maryland point guard to whom Henderson-Niles referred, said in response, \"[Memphis would] have a losing record in the [Atlantic Coast Conference]—probably win all of their games outside the league, losing record in the league. The ACC is too tough. You can't just win games night in and night out because you’re so athletic.\"\nMemphis accumulated a 14–0 run in the first half. Maryland, unable to ever significantly close the gap, eventually lost, 89–70. After the game, Vasquez rescinded his earlier remarks and conceded that Memphis might have finished .500 in the ACC. He said, \"They'll never play in the ACC, so we'll never know. But they proved me wrong. They're such a good team. I give them credit.\"\nResults.\n!colspan=9| Regular season\n!colspan=9| ACC tournament\n!colspan=9| NCAA tournament"

He appeared in 212 games played in Major League Baseball over all or parts of five seasons as an outfielder and pinch hitter for the Chicago White Sox (1959–60), Washington Senators (1961–62) and New York Mets (1963). \nBiography.\nBorn in Ivy, Virginia on Decca Farm, he batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and was listed as tall and . He graduated from high school in Charlottesville, where he attended the University of Virginia.\nHicks signed with the White Sox in 1953, beginning his pro career. After five seasons in the minor leagues and two years of service in the United States Army, Hicks was recalled by the pennant-bound White Sox in September 1959. He collected three hits and batted .429 in seven at bats during his late-season trial, then spent much of 1960 on the Chisox' MLB roster, almost exclusively as a pinch hitter. He hit only .191 and was left exposed in the expansion draft. Selected by the new Washington Senators as the 52nd overall pick, Hicks spent most of at Triple-A after an early-season audition with the Senators. However, he remained on the Washington roster during the full 1962 campaign, playing in 102 games, starting 29 in the outfield. He hit six home runs in limited service, but he batted only .224 overall and his contract was sold to the Mets at the close of the campaign.\nIn his final MLB year, Hicks started 46 games for the 1963 Mets, and hit .226 with five home runs. He concluded his career with a three-year stint with Triple-A Buffalo. Hicks was a solid offensive player in the minor leagues, batting .313 in 11 seasons. But limited playing time in the majors hurt his production: he collected only 92 total hits, with 11 doubles, three triples and 12 homers, in his 212 games, batting .221.\nPersonal life.\nHicks met his wife while playing for the Boer Indians in Nicaragua.\nJoe Hicks died on December 2, 2023, at the age of 91.\nHicks' grandson is professional soccer player Lee Johnston."

        "text": "Neil McCarthy (May 18, 1939 – September 18, 2021) was an American college basketball coach. He was head coach of the Weber State Wildcats team from 1974 to 1985 and at the New Mexico State Aggies from 1985 to 1997.\nAt Weber State, McCarthy led the Wildcats to four NCAA tournaments, including the school's first NCAA Tournament win since reaching the Sweet 16 in 1972. He remained Weber State's winningest coach until Randy Rahe broke his wins record in 2016.\nDuring most of McCarthy's tenure at New Mexico State, the Aggies were the second-best team in what became the Big West Conference, behind UNLV. After UNLV hit the skids, McCarthy took advantage and led the Aggies to four straight Big West tournament titles and four straight NCAA Tournaments from 1990 to 1994. His best team was the 1991–92 unit, which advanced all the way to the Sweet 16—the Aggies' deepest run in the tournament since the 1970 Final Four unit.\nMcCarthy was abruptly fired just weeks before the start of practice for the 1997–98 season. Athletic director Jim Paul cited a number of factors, principally the basketball team's poor performance in the classroom. McCarthy only graduated nine players in his 12 years at the school (an 11 percent graduation rate), including only one in his last four years. In Paul's view, this meant that McCarthy emphasized winning over academics. He left New Mexico State as the school's winningest coach, but has since been passed by Lou Henson.\nOfficially, McCarthy was reassigned as an assistant athletic director for the balance of his contract. However, he resigned rather than assume that post.\nAcademic scandals.\nDespite McCarthy's success in building two regional powers, two major academic scandals forced his departure from the coaching profession.\nIn early 1995, it emerged that six players had received help from one of McCarthy's assistants on their work at correspondence courses, including answers on their exams. After this came to light, New Mexico State withdrew from postseason consideration for the 1995-96 season. In July 1996, the NCAA placed New Mexico State on three years' probation and stripped the Aggies of their NCAA tournament appearances in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Although McCarthy was not involved in the violations, the NCAA severely criticized him for not properly controlling the program. It slapped him with a two-year \"show-cause\" order, meaning that if he ever left New Mexico State, any penalties imposed on him would have followed him to his new employer unless that school demonstrated that he had served his punishment.\nAfter his ouster, McCarthy sued New Mexico State for wrongful termination. During a deposition related to that suit, McCarthy admitted under oath that he had entered into a verbal agreement to hire Fletcher Cockrell, then the head coach at Jones County Community College in Mississippi, as an assistant coach if two of his star players signed with New Mexico State. Cockrell helped the players with their coursework and exams.\nAfter the violations came to light, New Mexico State withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2000–01 season, and placed the basketball team on two years' probation. The NCAA accepted New Mexico State's penalties, but imposed an additional four years' probation and forced the Aggies to vacate every game they played in 1996–97 and 1997–98. It also slapped McCarthy with a five-year show-cause order. Cockrell, who had been involved in violations at another school, received a 10-year show-cause order. The final report noted the similarities with the 1996 case. It also strongly hinted that had the Aggies not taken swift corrective action, the penalties might have been even harsher, and possibly included the \"death penalty\". However, it praised New Mexico State for forcing out McCarthy, the school president and Paul's predecessor as athletic director.\nDeath.\nMcCarthy died at his home in Utah on September 18, 2021.\nHead coaching record.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Floral Hall (Bowling Green, Ohio)",
        "text": "The Floral Hall is a historic community building in the city of Bowling Green, Ohio, United States. Constructed in the 1880s for one of two competing county fairs, it is typical of exhibition buildings from the period. Although no longer used for the county fair, it has been named a historic site.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe first Wood County fair was held in 1851 in Bowling Green, although the next five years saw it held also at Perrysburg and Portageville, due partially to dissension among the sponsoring Agricultural Society members and partially to the presence of diseases such as cholera and ague in the different grounds. The board purchased land at Tontogany for permanent fair grounds after the end of the Civil War, but Bowling Green still retained the memory of holding the county fair. This state of affairs ultimately induced the formation of a separate Wood County Fair Company in Bowling Green, which obtained land in Bowling Green and began holding fairs in 1881, becoming successful enough that the Agricultural Society began merger talks in 1885. From 1884 until 1894, their receipts grew from $3,889.30 to $7,945.99.\nUsage.\nThe Floral Hall was constructed in 1884 at the fairgrounds in Bowling Green; it originally held horticultural exhibits, although in the 20th century it was renamed \"Needle Hall\" after it began hosting needlework exhibitions. In later years, the fair moved to another location, the original grounds were converted into a city park, and all other buildings from the fairgrounds were eventually destroyed. However, the city retained the floral/needle hall, changing it into a picnic shelter and carefully attending to the building's upkeep.\nArchitecture.\nBuilt of wood, the building sits on a brick foundation and is covered with a shingled roof. Stone elements are also present, and the water table is built of wood. One story tall, the hall is an octagonal structure, typical of Ohio floral halls from the period; its plan is essentially a modified Greek cross. The doors and other parts of the facade bear Stick-style detailing.\nIn 1982, the former floral/needle hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and because of its place in local history. It is one of five National Register-listed locations in Bowling Green, and one of thirty-one in Wood County. Another Register-listed octagonal floral hall is located on the Morrow County fairgrounds in Mount Gilead."

        "text": "William E. Murphy (November 15, 1917 – May 16, 2005) was a Navy Cross winner in World War II, an American Championship tennis player and university coach.\nEarly life.\nIn 1941, he earned a Master's Degree in Physical Education from George Williams College in Chicago. In World War II as a dive bomber pilot in the Pacific, landing a bomb that helped sink the world's largest Japanese battleship \"Yamato\", earning Navy Cross.\nCareer.\nIn 1948, he became the coach of the University of Michigan tennis team, where he remained for 21 years until 1969. He led Michigan to Eleven Big Ten Team Championships and the NCAA Team Championship in 1957. In 1970, he became the tennis coach at the University of Arizona until retiring in 1981. He remained in Tucson and died in 2005 at age 87. His wife, Mimi, died in June 2011. Chet passed away in 2016.\nPlayer.\nA native of Chicago, Illinois, Murphy and twin brother, Chet, played for the University of Chicago from 1937 to 1939. They led the school to three Big Ten Conference Tennis Championships. As a doubles team, they were undefeated in collegiate meets, including wins at the Big Ten Conference Doubles Championships in 1938 and 1939. They were the Finalist team at the 1939 NCAA Doubles Championship.\nIn 1938, the Murphy brothers helped their undefeated team score the first clean sweep in the history of the Big Ten Conference Tennis Championships by winning all nine finals matches. The brothers won the doubles title over the Northwestern team, 5–7, 6–4, 7–5. John Shostrom won the No. 1 singles and the Murphy brothers won No. 2 and No. 3 singles. Bill beat Northwestern's Harry O'Neil, 6–0, 6–3. At the National level, the Murphy brothers were ranked as the #10 Doubles pair by the United States Lawn Tennis Association in 1938.\nIn May 1939, the brothers led the university to its third straight Big Ten Conference Tennis Championship. The Associated Press wrote, \"The University of Chicago, where the athletic habit of recent years has leaned toward defeat, now has a new complex well established – tennis championships.\" The Murphy brothers won their second consecutive Doubles Championship, and Chet won the No. 1 singles. Bill qualified to play for the No. 2 Singles title, but defaulted to save himself for the doubles competition. In June 1939, the brothers were runners up in the NCAA Doubles Championship to Bob Peacock and Doug Imhoff, of the University of California-Berkeley, and Chet was runner up in the NCAA Singles Championship to Frank Guernsey of Rice University.\nIn July 1939, Murphy won the singles title at the Western Tennis Association tournament in Chicago. The Associated Press reported that he won his Championship \"the hard way,\" defeating top-ranked Wilbur F. Coen, Jr., aka Junior Coen, of Kansas City in the semifinals, and then defeated #2 seeded Jack Tidball of Los Angeles, 6–8, 6–1, 6–1, 9–7 in the finals. The following week, he won the mixed doubles at the Longwood Cricket Club tennis tournament in Brookline, Massachusetts with Mary Arnold.\nIn August 1939, at the Meadow Club Invitation tournament in Southampton, New York, the brothers beat the team of Peacock and Imhoff, but lost a close doubles match against Wimbledon champions Bobby Riggs and Elwood Cooke. They won two of the first three sets but ultimately lost, 13–11, 3–6, 7–5, 4–6, 0–6. At Seabright, they beat Riggs and Bitsy Grant.\nCoach.\nMurphy was the tennis coach at the University of Michigan for 21 years from 1948–1969. His Michigan tennis teams won 11 Big Ten Conference Championships and the NCAA Team Championship in 1957. His career coaching record at Michigan was 198–45–0, an .821 winning percentage. In 1953, he recruited three outstanding junior players: Mark Jaffe, Barry MacKay and Dick Potter. They formed the core of his teams for three years. MacKay and Potter broke the Big Ten record held by Bill and Chet for most Big Ten Conference Doubles Championships with three. MacKay and Potter won the Big Ten Conference Doubles Championships in 1955, 1956, and 1957.\nIn 1970, Bill was hired by Dave Strack, Athletic Director at University of Arizona and former basketball coach at Michigan, as the tennis coach. He retired there in 1981, and lived in Tucson until his death in 2005 at age 87.\nCoaching record at Michigan:\nAuthor.\nBill Murphy wrote books about tennis together with Chet. They wrote \"Tennis Handbook\", published in 1962, \"Championship Drills\", \"Advanced Tennis\", \"Tennis for Thinking Players\", and \"Tested Tennis Tips\". The two were recognized for their books with an International Tennis Hall of Fame Educational Services Award in 1973."

        "title": "Bob Quinn (baseball, born 1936)",
        "text": "Robert E. Quinn (born 1936) is a former American professional baseball executive. Quinn spent almost 30 years in senior front office positions in Major League Baseball and worked as the general manager of three clubs: the New York Yankees (June 8, 1988 – October 12, 1989), Cincinnati Reds (October 13, 1989 – end of the season) and San Francisco Giants (December 1, 1992 – September 30, 1996). He was the general manager of the World Series champion Cincinnati Reds.\nFamily.\nQuinn is a third-generation member of a family involved in baseball management since the turn of the 20th century. His grandfather J.A. Robert Quinn at one time was an owner of the Boston Red Sox and Boston Braves and general manager of the St. Louis Browns and Brooklyn Dodgers. His father, John J. Quinn, was GM of the Braves in Boston and Milwaukee and the Philadelphia Phillies between 1945 and 1972. A brother-in-law, Roland Hemond, was also a longtime baseball executive and general manager of the Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles. And Quinn's son, also named Bob, served from 2003 until early 2018 as the Milwaukee Brewers' executive vice president, finance and administration, the fourth generation of the Quinn family to work in senior management positions in professional baseball.\nRobert E. Quinn grew up in Newton, Massachusetts, and was 17 when he moved with his family to Milwaukee with the Braves in 1953. He graduated from Marquette University in 1958 and began his baseball career in the Braves' and Phillies' minor league organizations. In 1967, he helped establish the Reading Phillies as Philadelphia's Eastern League farm team, winning The Sporting News' Minor League Executive of the Year Award as a first-year general manager there. Reading celebrated its 50th straight year as the Phillies' Double-A affiliate in 2016. Quinn then helped to re-establish a minor league franchise in Omaha in 1969–70 as the first front-office boss of the Omaha Royals of the Triple-A American Association. That franchise celebrated its 50th consecutive season as the Kansas City Royals' top affiliate in 2018.\nQuinn joined Milwaukee's current Major League team, the Brewers, as their farm system director in 1971. In 1973, he accepted a similar post with the Cleveland Indians, and spent over a dozen years working as the Indians' scouting and player development boss. He was promoted to vice president in 1981.\nCareer as general manager.\nNew York Yankees.\nIn 1987, Quinn joined the Yankees as vice president, baseball administration. In May 1988, the Bombers' incumbent GM, Lou Piniella, turned in his resignation; on June 8, Quinn was named his successor. Not even two weeks into his tenure, Quinn faced a mutiny from the manager he inherited, Billy Martin. Quinn had activated a catcher, Don Slaught, from the disabled list based on input from the Yankees' medical staff. Martin disagreed vehemently with the Slaught decision and announced he would boycott the team's management meetings. Owner George Steinbrenner did not intercede on Martin's behalf, and Martin was replaced by Piniella as manager on June 23 with the Yankees 40–28 and 2½ games behind the Detroit Tigers in the American League East Division. They went only 45–48 under Piniella to finish fifth in , then posted a 74–87 mark in , their first losing season since , and Quinn resigned October 12.\nCincinnati Reds.\nQuinn immediately succeeded Murray Cook as general manager of the Cincinnati Reds, and he proceeded to hire Piniella as his field manager. The 1989 season had been a disaster on and off the field: the Reds finished 75–87 and in fifth place in a year marred by the gambling allegations against and the suspension and disbarment of manager Pete Rose. During that offseason, Quinn acquired fireballing relief pitcher Randy Myers and rookie first baseman Hal Morris. In 1990, Morris posted a .340 batting average and finished third in the National League Rookie of the Year balloting. Myers teamed with Rob Dibble and Norm Charlton to form The Nasty Boys, a formidable bullpen trio.\nThe 1990 Reds won 91 games and the National League West Division championship, defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in six games in the NLCS (with Morris hitting .417), and then swept the favored Oakland Athletics in the World Series behind The Nasty Boys' dominant relief work. Quinn was named \"Executive of the Year\" by The Sporting News in recognition of Cincinnati's 1990 turnaround.\nThe Reds suffered a down season in , falling to fifth place, but recovered to win 90 games in , although they finished eight games behind the division champion Atlanta Braves. But there was turbulence in the Cincinnati front office. Owner Marge Schott cut Quinn's scouting and farm system budget, then fired him at the end of the 1992 season.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nTwo months later, Quinn became general manager of the Giants at one of the turning points in their history in the San Francisco Bay Area. The 1992 Giants finished 72–90, 26 games behind the Braves (and 18 games in arrears of Quinn's Reds) and had drawn 1.56 million fans to Candlestick Park—next to last in the National League. For much of the season, it appeared that the Giants were about to move to Tampa–Saint Petersburg after owner Bob Lurie agreed to sell them to Florida businessman Vince Naimoli. But in November, the National League rejected the Tampa deal, and Lurie instead sold the Giants to a Bay Area investment group headed by Peter Magowan. The new owners announced the team was staying in San Francisco, hired Quinn as general manager on December 1, 1992, signed free agent superstar left fielder Barry Bonds on December 9, and promoted Dusty Baker to manager on December 16. The 1993 Giants proceeded to improve by 31 games, going 103–59, Bonds won the NL Most Valuable Player Award, and attendance jumped to 2.6 million. However, the Giants finished a game behind the Braves in the NL West and did not qualify for the postseason in the last pre-wild card full season in Major League Baseball.\nThree sub-.500 seasons followed the Giants' 1993 breakout year, and at the close of , Quinn stepped down as general manager. His successor was assistant general manager/director of player personnel Brian Sabean, the former director of scouting of the Yankees who had followed Quinn to the Giants' organization in 1993. Under Sabean, GM from 1997 through 2014, the Giants would win three World Series championships and four National League pennants. Under Magowan they moved into AT&amp;T Park in and solidified their popularity in the Bay Area.\nQuinn remained with the Giants as a vice president and senior adviser through 1997. He currently resides in Scottsdale, Arizona. Tommy John described him as having a \"soft-spoken manner.\""

        "text": "William Henry Thomas (22 March 1866 – 11 October 1921) was a Welsh international rugby union player who played club rugby for Llanelli and London Welsh. He was capped eleven times for Wales and captained the team on two occasions. In 1888, Thomas was chosen to tour New Zealand and Australia as part of the first British Isles team. This unofficial tour did not play any international opposition and no caps were awarded.\nThomas was born in Fishguard in 1866 to E.B. Thomas of Pembrokeshire. He was educated at Llandovery College before graduating to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1885.\nRugby career.\nIn 1885, while still a schoolboy at Llandovery College, Thomas was selected for the final Welsh game of the Home Nations Championship. Captained by Newport's Charlie Newman, Wales engineered a draw through unsporting tactics, mainly by killing the ball whenever possible by lying on it. Thomas was reselected for both Welsh games of the 1886 Home Nations Championship, still representing Llandovery for the opening game against England at Blackheath, but having progressed to the Cambridge University team by the time Wales hosted Scotland a week later. Wales lost both matches, but in the second game at the Cardiff Arms Park against Scotland, Thomas was part of the first Welsh team to trial the four three-quarter system. In 1886 and 1887, Thomas was on the winning Cambridge team in the Varsity match against Oxford, collecting two sporting Blues.\nThomas played twice in the 1887 Championship, in the losses to England and Scotland, but missed the win over Ireland when he was replaced by William Towers. Thomas was back for both games of the 1888 Championship, but by now was representing London based exiles, London Welsh. The opening game saw the first Welsh win over Scotland, thanks to a debut try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins. This was also the first winning international game Thomas had been part of, though the team could not capitalise on their success when they were beaten by Ireland in the second and final game of the tournament.\nThomas missed the next four games for Wales, including the historic match against the New Zealand Natives, but returned for the second game of the 1890 Championship. After having lost to Scotland in the tournament opener, Thomas was back in the pack to face England. Now captained by Wales rugby legend Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales won an historic victory over the English, after some clever line-out play by William Stadden. This was the first time Wales had beaten England and the result gave Wales a chance of taking the tournament title when they face Ireland two weeks later. The Welsh were unable to take advantage of their England win, when they drew, with a goal apiece, at Lansdowne Road. Wales were heading towards defeat before a late Charlie Thomas try gave Wales an equaliser. More notable was the fight between the two sides at the after-match dinner, in which nine players found themselves in Dublin Court the next day. The press did not release the names of the culprits, so it is not known if Thomas was among them.\nThomas represented Wales twice more, when he was given the captaincy in the final two games of the 1891 Championship. Thomas was now playing for Llanelli, and his final match was to lead his country out in a win over Ireland at Stradey Park.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "Artistic Gymnastics World Cup",
        "text": "The Artistic Gymnastics World Cup is a competition series for artistic gymnastics sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). It is one of the few tournaments in artistic gymnastics officially organized by FIG, as well as the World Championships and the gymnastics competitions at the Olympic Games and the Youth Olympics. Beginning in the 2017-2020 quadrennium, the All-Around and Individual Apparatus World Cup series are used to qualify a maximum of seven spots to the Olympic Games.\nHistory.\nThe Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) hosted the first artistic gymnastics on an international scale in 1975. This genre of sport from then onwards was named as the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup, an original competition reserved for the current best gymnasts. It was composed of a single and unique event, bringing together very few gymnasts in all around competition and in apparatus finals. This initiative was taken in a particular context, since the world championships took place merely every four years. The world cup event held every year for artistic gymnastics was, however, upheld only until 1990.\nIn 1997, the World Cup was revived as a series of qualifying events for a period of two years, culminating in a final event that was known as the World Cup Final. The different stages, sometimes referred to as World Cup qualifiers, mostly served the purpose of awarding points to individual gymnasts and groups according to their placements. These points would be added up over the two-year period to qualify a limited number of athletes to the biennial World Cup Final event. Six World Cup Final events were staged in even years from 1998 to 2008. For example, the World Cup Final competition in 1998 served as the last stage of a series of competitions through the 1997–1998 season. At the World Cup Final, gold, silver and bronze medals were awarded to individual athletes in each apparatus.\nEight standalone World Cup events had been staged from 1975 to 1990, and FIG retroactively named these events World Cup Final. The gymnasts were invited to these world cups based on results from the previous world championships or Olympic Games. From 1997 to 2008, the World Cup series of qualifying events were the only way athletes could qualify for the World Cup Final. At the FIG Council in Cape Town (South Africa) in May 2008, members decided to no longer run any world cup and series finals for all FIG disciplines from January 2009.\nIn 2011, the apparatus competitions were renamed World Challenge Cups while the all-around competitions kept the World Cup name. In 2013, FIG created three distinct competition series with the reintroduction of the Individual Apparatus World Cup series, along with the existing All-Around World Cup series and the World Challenge Cup series.\nCurrent format.\nBeginning in 2009, the World Cup has been competed strictly as a series of stages with no culminating final event. In each of the stages, the top three gymnasts in each apparatus or the all-around, depending on the type of competition, are awarded medals and prize money. There are currently three separate series run by the FIG: the All-Around World Cup series (C-II), the Individual Apparatus World Cup (C-III) series, and the World Challenge Cup series. For the All-Around World Cup series, gymnasts' standing counts toward their countries' final placement. For the latter two series, gymnasts' standing counts toward their own individual ranking, and they do not pool results with their teammates.\nThe two individual apparatus series are open to all athletes and are especially popular among athletes from countries with smaller gymnastics programs. The All-Around World Cup series, however, is an invitation-only series of competitions for the top countries at the previous year's World Championships or Olympic Games. Each of the eight competing countries at any given cup has the option to choose any one gymnast to compete with the exception of the host country, which has a wild-card spot for a second gymnast.\nAfter each stage, all gymnasts (not just medal winners) are awarded points according to their placement, with the winner of each competition receiving the maximum number of 30 points per competition. After the last event of the World Cup series, the three or four best results at the World Cup stages count towards a ranking list. The same is true for the World Challenge Cup series. The individual gymnast with the highest number of points in each apparatus is then declared the winner of the series. For the All-Around World Cup, the country with the most points total is victorious. Only the winning nation receives a cup at the end of the series, while the top three gymnasts receive prize money.\nThe All-Around World Cup and the World Challenge Cup series are both one-year long series, with the competing nations at the All-Around World Cup series changing yearly. For the Individual Apparatus World Cup, the winner in each apparatus is declared after a two-year long series, beginning shortly after the World Championships or Olympic Games in an even-numbered year and concluding two years later.\nEvents.\nWorld Cup qualifiers.\nFrom 1997 to 2008, a series of World Cup qualifiers were staged. The top 3 gymnasts in each apparatus at the qualifier events would receive medals and prize money. Gymnasts who finished in the top 8 would also receive points that would be added up to a ranking which would qualify individual gymnasts for the biennial World Cup Final.\nWorld Cup series.\nIn 2009 and 2010, events in the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series were divided into Category A events (reserved for invited athletes only) and Category B events (open to all athletes). In 2011 and 2012, the individual apparatus competitions were renamed World Challenge Cup events while the all-around competitions retained the World Cup name. Since 2013, the World Cup series has been divided into three groups: 1) the All-Around World Cup series; 2) the World Challenge Cup series; and 3) the Individual Apparatus World Cup series. All of the World Challenge Cup and Individual Apparatus World Cup competitions remain open to all athletes, while the All-Around World Cup competitions are by invitation only, according to the results of the previous World Championships or Olympic Games. In 2021, the All-Around World Cup series was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic and has not been brought back for the 2021-2024 Olympic cycle.\nHosts.\nA number of nations across six different continents have hosted the events, including the World Cup Finals, World Cup qualifiers, as well as the World Cup and World Challenge Cup stages from 1975 to 2024.\nOlympic qualification.\nFIG announced prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics that the test event for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan and subsequent Olympics would no longer serve to qualify additional teams and individual event specialists. Instead, placements at the World Championships in the two years prior to the Olympics would determine the qualified teams, while individual athletes would have a number of ways to qualify: World Championships all-around and event placement, all-around placement at the numerous continental championships in the Olympic Year, and the Cup series.\nFIG later released a video explaining the specifics of the new qualification process, including the role of the various World Cup series. While the World Challenge Cup Series remains strictly a series of individual competitions, the final All-Around World Cup (C-II) series and Individual Apparatus World Cup (C-III) series gain importance as they allow gymnasts to qualify additional spots to the Olympic Games. Specifically, the first, second, and third-place finishing countries in the All-Around World Cup series in the Olympic year each qualify a non-nominative spot to the Olympic Games in addition to the four team spots qualified at a previous World Championship. The winning countries are announced in the spring, and they are required to give the spot to a gymnast by the deadline shortly before the Olympics that summer.\nThe Individual Apparatus World Cup series allows four additional gymnasts to qualify Olympic spots. The overall winner on each apparatus for the series beginning two years before the Olympics and concluding the spring of the Olympic year wins a nominative spot to the Olympics, meaning they are not dependent on their countries' federation to grant them a spot. Each gymnast can only qualify as the winner of one event, meaning if a gymnast wins the series on both uneven bars and balance beam, they still only use one of the available spots to qualify to the Olympics.\nAdditionally, countries that have already qualified a full team at a prior World Championship can only win up to one additional spot from each Cup series. If a gymnast from a previously qualified country wins the overall vault series title, and another gymnast from the same country wins the floor exercise title, a tiebreaker is used to determine which one qualifies to the Olympic Games. However, if the overall winners of the two apparatus series are both from a country which has not qualified a full team at the World Championships, both advance to the Olympics.\nThe FIG also announced a policy to prevent countries from using one gymnast to qualify multiple spots to the Olympics so that the spots would be most accurately distributed based on a country's depth. Gymnasts are not allowed to qualify spots from multiple different ways. Spots are awarded in chronological order, meaning the first spots are awarded at the World Championships in the two years prior to the Olympics, followed by the non-nominative spots won by countries in the All-Around World Cup series in the spring of the Olympic year, followed by the nominative spots won by individual gymnasts in the Individual Apparatus World Cup series, followed by the non-nominative spots won by gymnasts at the continental championships generally held in the summer.\nThe qualification rule combined with the chronological awarding of spots has two major consequences. First, since countries that qualified full teams are only eligible for two additional, non-team spots, if they win a non-nominative spot at the All-Around World Cup series and a nominative spot at the Individual Apparatus World Cup series, they are ineligible to earn a third additional spot, even if their gymnast wins the continental championship. Second, gymnasts who competed at the World Championships and qualified a spot with the team are not eligible to qualify a spot through the Individual Apparatus World Cup series or the continental championships, as these spots, whether nominative or non-nominative, are won by an individual gymnast. They are, however, still eligible to be named to a non-nominative individual spot for their country and compete at the Olympics as long as an eligible gymnast won the spot they are using. Despite this option, in 2018 several gymnasts decided to try to win a nominative spot through the Individual Apparatus World Cup series over the next two years. In anticipation of their countries' qualifying a full team to the Olympics at the 2018 World Championships, several gymnasts, most notably uneven bars specialist Fan Yilin of China, vault and floor exercise specialist Jade Carey of the United States, and vault specialist Maria Paseka of Russia announced that they would not try to qualify for the World Championships so that they would not be prevented from qualifying a nominative spot through the Individual Apparatus World Cup series.\nSuccessful nations.\nWhat follows is a list of nations which have earned at least one medal at the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup circuit. Results accounted for include: 1) FIG World Cup Final events, staged between 1975 and 2008; 2) all of the stages from the World Cup series (including World Cup Qualifiers from 1997 to 2008) up to 2023; and 3) all of the stages from the World Challenge Cup events, since 2011."

        "text": "Charles Irving \"Charlie\" Leigh Sr. (October 29, 1945 – October 26, 2006) was a National Football League (NFL) running back. He was the first and only NFL player to be signed out of high school. He is best known for backing up Larry Csonka and returning kicks for the Miami Dolphins' back to back Super Bowl champions in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. He also played for the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers. He played a total of six seasons in the NFL.\nEarly years.\nLeigh attended Albany High School in Albany, where he was a standout athlete in football and basketball. As a senior, he led his football team to an undefeated season.\nProfessional career.\nIn 1965, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Leigh as an undrafted free agent, after then commissioner Pete Rozelle made a special ruling, allowing him to become the first and only NFL player to be signed directly out of high school. Charlie was only 19 years old when he signed with the Steelers. He was listed in the pre-season programs and even got as far as the 1965 media guide. Realizing Charlie needed development Pittsburgh moved him to the Pennsylvania Mustangs of the NAFL which was a minor league team. In Charlies first game with the Mutangs he returned a kickoff \nfor 95 yards and Td. \nIn 1966 Charlie went to the Continental Football League. He started the season with the Orlando Panthers where he rushed for 92 yards and returned punts. Half way through the season he was traded to the Philadelphia Bulldogs where he rushed for 192 yards, scored 2 touchdowns and returned kicks for 169 yards. Charlie also won his first Championship with the Bulldogs. In 1967 Charlie went to play for the Norfolk Neptunes where he rushed for 452 yards and 8 touchdowns. Charlie also led the team in kickoff and punt returns while leading them to the conference championship.\nLeigh was a part of the taxi squad of the Cleveland Browns from 1966 to 1967, while also playing for the Panthers. He made his NFL debut in 1968, after making the team. As a running back, he rushed 23 times for 144 yards, a 6.3 yards per carry average, and he scored two touchdowns. One touchdown, scored against the Baltimore Colts, was ranked 69th among the 100 greatest rushing touchdowns in NFL history. His number of carries, total rushing yards and yards per carry average all proved to be career highs. He was also used extensively as a kick returner. He returned 14 kickoffs for 322 yards, a 23.0 yard per return average. And he returned 14 punts for 76 yards, a 5.4-yard per return average. Leigh led the Browns and placed 13th in the NFL in both yards per kickoff return and yards per punt return in 1968. He was released on August 29, 1969.\nOn September 1, 1969, he was claimed off waivers by the San Francisco 49ers. He would later be cut and re-signed by the Browns, but received little time at running back and did not carry the ball the entire season, although he did catch two passes. He did return five punts for 18 yards and two kickoffs for six yards that season. He was cut before the start of the 1970 season.\nIn 1970, he played 8 games for the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League, before being released.\nIn 1971, he was signed by the Miami Dolphins after a tryout. That season, he rushed five times for 15 yards and returned just four kickoffs for 99 yards, although he appeared in all 14 games. He couldn't play in Super Bowl VI against the Dallas Cowboys, because of a separated right shoulder he suffered in the AFC championship game against the Baltimore Colts.\nLeigh became the primary punt returner for the famous 1972 Miami Dolphins team that had a perfect season and won Super Bowl VII. Leigh returned 22 punts for 210 yards and a 9.5-yard average for the 1972 Dolphins. The 22 punts returned ranked 5th in the NFL that season, and the 210 yards and 9.5 average each ranked 6th in the NFL that season. Leigh also returned six kickoff 153 yards, a 25.5-yard average, and rushed 21 times for 79 yards, a 3.8-yard average. Leigh got to play in Miami's 14–7 Super Bowl victory over the Washington Redskins, but did not have any carries or returns.\nLeigh had one of his most productive seasons in 1973 for the Dolphins, another Super Bowl championship team. Leigh rushed 22 times for 134 yards for a 6.1 yards per carry average with one touchdown. His yards per carry average was second on the team to Mercury Morris' league leading 6.4. He also returned nine kickoffs for 251 yards, for a 27.9 average that would have ranked 6th in the NFL had he had enough returns to qualify for the league leaders. He also had nine punt returns for 64 yards, for a 7.1 average.\nIn 1974, he played one game for the Dolphins before being released. On September 26, 1974, he was claimed off waivers by the Green Bay Packers. He appeared in 10 games, returned 9 kickoffs, for 201 yards and a 22.3-yard average. He also carried the ball one time for the Packers but did not gain any yards. He wasn't re-signed after the season.\nCareer stats.\nFor his career, Leigh rushed 72 times for 372 yards, a 5.2 yards per carry average and two touchdowns. The 5.2 yards per carry average was better than several of his more celebrated teammates, including Hall of Famer Leroy Kelly (4.2), Hall of Famer Larry Csonka (4.3), 3 time Pro Bowler Mercury Morris (5.1) and 2 time Pro Bowler Jim Kiick (3.7). He also returned 46 kickoffs for 1082 yards and a 23.5 yards per return average, and returned 50 punts for 368 yards and a 7.4 yards per return average.\nPersonal life.\nLeigh died of lung cancer on October 26, 2006."

The two teams have played 49 matches; South Africa have won 25 times to the Lions' 18, with the remaining six matches finishing as draws. The Lions won the first two series between the two sides in 1891 and 1896, including wins in the first six matches, but then did not win another series until their unbeaten 1974 tour. After South Africa's victory in the 1980 series, the two teams did not meet again until 1997 as a result of apartheid sanctions; the Lions won the 1997 series, before South Africa won the next two tours; 2009 and 2021."

He played 58 games in three years for the Rabbitohs, and was regarded as a senior player by the time he was 24, forming a solid halves combination with Craig Field.\nReturn to the Eels.\nHis strong form at South Sydney gave him the opportunity to return home to Parramatta, and he went on to play another 53 games for the club. In 1997, he won the club's Jack Boyle Tackling School Award, which is awarded to the club's best tackler each season. In 1998, Bell played 22 games for Parramatta and was a member of the side which nearly made the grand final but suffered defeat to Canterbury in the preliminary final. With less than ten minutes to left the clock, Parramatta had been winning 18-2, but lost the game 32–20 in extra time.\nBy 1999, however, Bell was struggling to make first grade and instead captained the Eels’ reserve-grade team to a win in the NSWRL First Division Grand Final.\nFinal years.\nBell was not re-signed by Parramatta for 2000 and instead joined the Newtown club in the NSWRL First Division. Newtown had a feeder relationship with the Auckland Warriors, and mid-season injuries to Stacey Jones and John Simon saw him signed by the Warriors. Bell played eight games to finish off the season for the Warriors.\nAt the end of the 2000 season, the Warriors were sold and the new owners opted not to re-sign Bell."

These shirts have a style of camp shirt in which the fabric, color and design vary greatly, but frequently incorporate contrasting earth tones and simple geometric designs, with more expensive ones often made of silk. They may have a single pocket on the left—small logos or monogram initials are also common options on the left breast.\nOrigins.\nBowling shirts have their roots in the 1950s when bowling became a popular recreational activity in the United States. During this time, bowling alleys were not just places for competition but also social gatherings. To match the leisurely atmosphere of bowling, bowlers began wearing shirts designed explicitly for the sport. These shirts were a departure from traditional attire and quickly gained popularity for their comfort and style.\nCulture.\nThe shirt is associated most directly with ten-pin bowling but they are also associated with bar culture, billiards culture and rockabilly, ska, and jump blues music. The \"Two and a Half Men\" character Charlie Harper, portrayed by Charlie Sheen, often wears two-tone bowling shirts. "

        "title": "American Football League (1934)",
        "text": "The 1934 edition of the American Football League was a short-lived professional american football minor league with teams based in the American South and Southwest. The first of several minor leagues with the same name, the 1934 was also one of the first involving teams not located in the American Midwest and East. While its membership was the cornerstone of American football in the southern U.S. (with several having beaten National Football League teams on the gridiron), the AFL had only one season of competition and folded after cancelling competition in the 1935 season.\nParticipating teams.\nCharlotte Bantams. Formed in 1932 and playing primarily teams based along the Atlantic Coast, the Bantams amassed a 10–3 record in 1933.\nDallas Rams. Founded in 1933 with the expressed purpose of joining the new AFL as a natural rival of teams in Oklahoma City and Houston, the Rams played only three games that year. One unique fact about the Rams was that as of November 1934, they were owned by a woman: Glyma Orr, identified in print as \"a young society woman\" from Dallas, who had also been a former head cheerleader and was a devoted football fan. When not running the team, she ran a school of dramatic arts. The press reported that she was believed to be the first woman to ever own a football team.\nLouisville Bourbons. Founded in 1931, the Bourbons played primarily against opponents in the Midwest, including the Portsmouth Spartans of the NFL.\nMemphis Tigers. Formed in 1927 as \"New Bry’s Hurricanes\" and renamed in 1928, the Tigers were the dominant football team of the South from 1929 to 1932. In 1929, Memphis defeated the Green Bay Packers 20-7 (the Packers eventually won the 1929 NFL championship without losing a league game).\nSt. Louis Blues. Formed by the league after the St. Louis Gunners rejected the league's overtures for membership. Sports promoter Bud Yates was credited with founding the team after being general manager for the 1926-27 St. Louis Blues independent team (which lost only one game in its two-season existence). and founding crosstown rivals St. Louis Gunners (in 1931) \nand St. Louis Veterans (in 1932). When the Gunners joined the NFL in November 1934, the Blues moved to Kansas City.\nTulsa Oilers. Formed in late 1933 as the Tulsa Drillers, the team played (and lost) only three games that season (two against Oklahoma City, one against the St. Louis Gunners). Coached by Billy Boehm, the team featured former members of the University of Tulsa football team.\nTeams who joined the league but were forced out.\nOklahoma City Chiefs. Formed in 1932, the Chiefs lost only one game in their inaugural year (to Portsmouth) and continued their success in 1933 as they staked their claim as being one of the two strongest minor league teams (along with the St. Louis Gunners). Because their home stadium could seat only 2000 people, the league dropped the Chiefs when the team's efforts to secure a \"suitable\" stadium failed. The team ceased to exist two months later.\nHouston. Having joined the league despite not having a team organization or player roster, Houston was dropped when Oklahoma City was given the boot. The team never came into existence.\nOrigin of league.\nAfter the collapse of the first American Football League and the paring of ten teams from the NFL after the 1926 season, professional American football was concentrated in the American Midwest and Northeast. The Memphis Tigers developed into a strong independent football team, comparable to those based in Ohio and Pennsylvania.\nIn 1929, a Memphis team that was temporarily enhanced by the addition of Ken Strong and several other NFL players defeated the Green Bay Packers. The victory prompted Tigers owner Clarence Saunders to claim the \"national pro championship.\" Memphis was not seriously challenged by non-NFL teams in 1930, but in 1931, promoter Bud Yates founded the St. Louis Gunners with future Hall of Fame member Jimmy Conzelman as the team's coach. After a respectable 5-2-1 record in 1931 (playing all of its games at Public Schools Stadium in St. Louis), the Gunners changed coaches (to Bullet Baker) and played a more ambitious schedule in 1932, playing the Tigers to one win, one loss, and one tie – a November 27, 1932, game between the two teams was billed as for the \"independent pro championship\" ended with a 0–0 score.\nThe 1931 season saw the start of the Louisville Bantams, which played most of the games in its inaugural season against teams based in Ohio (including the Ironton Tanks); the following season saw the formation of the Charlotte Bantams and the Oklahoma City Chiefs. By 1933, both Charlotte and Oklahoma City were not only able to compete toe-to-toe with Memphis and the St. Louis Gunners, but both dominated the Tigers in three out of four games that year.\nOn November 14, 1933, Memphis Tigers owner S. A. Goodman, boasting that the Tigers have been playing \"as good football as in the NFL\" and that St. Louis and Oklahoma City \"could win… in the NFL at any time,\" announced plans for a new major football league, which he named the American Football League. In the three weeks after the announcement, the Gunners defeated NFL teams in successive games and a new team in Tulsa, the Drillers, came into being and played competitively against Oklahoma City and St. Louis, losing all three of their games.\nFormation.\nIn 1933, Goodman stated \"We don’t want a Southern league, nor a secondary league.\" Yet by the summer of 1934, his new league was to have teams representing Memphis (Tigers), St. Louis (Gunners), Oklahoma City (Chiefs), Tulsa (the newly renamed Oilers), Charlotte (Bantams), Louisville (Bourbons), Dallas, and Houston. Even then, plans for the league had to be altered as neither Dallas nor Houston had organized teams at that point... and the Gunners did not want to join the embryonic league as they had aspirations for joining the NFL (in fact, the team bought the NFL's Cincinnati Reds franchise for $20,000 on August 8, 1934, but the sale was vetoed by the NFL team owners).\nIn August, Oklahoma City was expelled from the league because their home stadium (a minor league baseball park) could hold only 2000 people in the grandstands (the Chiefs would continue as an independent team for two more months before folding); at the same time, Houston was dropped from the lineup as there was no progress in organizing a football team in time for the start of the season. On the other hand, Dallas \"was\" successful in forming a new team, the Rams. Also in August, Bud Yates (founder of the St. Louis Gunners in 1931 and the St. Louis Veterans in 1932) was enlisted to organize a third St. Louis team, this time called the St. Louis Blues, which featured former Gunners Dick Frahm and John Breidenstein.\nCompetition and dissolution.\nBy October 7, 1934, the day of the league's first games, the AFL settled on a double round robin schedule, with each team scheduled to play one road game and one home game against each of the other members of the league. Despite the league's intention, only Memphis and Charlotte managed to play the full ten games as weather forced the cancellation of several games.\nFinal league standings – 1934\nBy late October, the Blues' supremacy was virtually conceded as St. Louis was not only dominating each of its games but also outdrawing the Gunners, which had to cobble together a schedule after the rejection by the NFL and the reduction of availability of AFL members for scheduled football games. When the Gunners’ purchase of the Cincinnati Reds was finally approved by the NFL, Blues' ownership decided not to compete with the newest member of the National Football League and opted to move across the state of Missouri, to Kansas City, one-time home of the NFL's Kansas City Blues and Kansas City Cowboys. After the move, the former St. Louis Blues became the new Kansas City Blues.\nThe St. Louis/Kansas City Blues ran roughshod through the league, with only a tie with Memphis marring its won-lost record with a late-season tie. On December 16, 1934, the Blues finally met the Gunners for the first (and only) time, with the NFL team prevailing 7-0 before it was disbanded due to unpaid tax debts (a new St. Louis Gunners team would surface by later 1935, again as an independent).\nPreparations for the 1935 season saw the Blues returning to St. Louis after the Gunners' dissolution and Louisville playing exhibition games in September, but none of the other league members had bothered to assemble their squads, including the Tigers, which were sited in the league's home city, Memphis. S. A. Goodman, both the president of the AFL and the owner of the Tigers, announced on September 26, 1935, that due to \"lateness in organizing\", the 1935 AFL season was cancelled, but the league would return in 1936.\nSt. Louis and Louisville played four games in front of diminishing crowds before folding; the Memphis squad was tentatively put together by two longtime Tigers (Red Clavette and Cliff Norvell) and bankrolled by Wilson Murrah. While the team managed to play three games (scoring 100 points in the process), the writing was on the wall: the Tigers (and any possibility of the AFL returning in 1936) winked out of existence.\nAll-League teams.\nDespite the AFL's existing for only one season, it had two All-League teams, one selected by Associated Press writers in the cities represented by the AFL teams and one selected by the coaches of the American Football League.\nAFL All-League team (selected by coaches).\nFIRST TEAM\nSECOND TEAM"

        "text": "Melanie Smith (born September 23, 1949) is an equestrian from the United States and Olympic champion.\nShe was born in Germantown, Tennessee, and grew up on her parents' farm learning to ride horses. She won several amateur competitions and got better at her sport, advancing into the Grand Prix class in 1976. She won many of the top competitions in this class over her long career in show jumping.\nShe was on the U.S. gold medal team in the Pan American Games in 1979, riding Val de Loire. She qualified for the 1980 Olympics, but did not compete due to the U.S. Olympic Committee's boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russia. She was one of 461 athletes to receive a Congressional Gold Medal instead. She also won a bronze medal in the individual jumping category on Calypso at the Alternate Olympics. She qualified for the Olympics again four years later in 1984, and helped win the first team gold for the U.S. in Olympic Show Jumping, again riding Calypso. In 1980 she placed second in the World Cup on Calypso, and at the 1982 World Cup, she won. She also rode Calypso to help the U.S. team win the Nations Cup and the World Cup in 1983. She won the show jumping triple crown on Calypso, becoming one of two riders to achieve that honor, as well as the only horse/rider team ever to do it.\nSmith was inducted into the Show Jumping Hall of Fame in 1988. Her mount, Calypso, is in the Show Jumping Hall of Fame. Smith was included in the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 1998.\nShe married Lee Taylor in 1985, and lives on Wildwood Farm in Germantown, where she continues to breed thoroughbred horses for show jumping, hunting, and polo. She worked with her husband on the farm until his death in 2005. Since her retirement, Smith has provided commentary for many major televised jumping events and taught horse clinics throughout the United States, including at her own farm. She has judged competitions and designed courses for show jumping. She wrote the book \"Riding With Life: Lessons from the Horse\", about what she has learned over the years living with horses.\nEarly life and career.\nMelanie Ainsworth Smith was born on her parents' farm in Germantown, Tennessee on September 23, 1949. She started riding around the age of two and was involved in competition with horses at an early age through her membership in the local Pony Club. Smith's mother ran a riding school at their farm, and she learned to ride from her mother when she was younger. She was trained by George Morris from 1968 to 1970. After this period of training, she went to live in Stonington, Connecticut, on Neil and Helen Eustace's Stillmeadow farm. The Eustaces bought horses from breeders in Europe, and had them delivered to the U.S. for Smith to ride, including Radnor II, Val de Loir, and Calypso.\nSmith went on to the Grand Prix tour riding Radnor II in 1976 and won the American Grand Prix Lady Rider of the Year Award as well as the Overall Rider of the Year Award. This event led to the AGA's decision to stop giving out their separate Lady Rider of the Year Award. This was because Smith had helped prove, in winning both awards, that a woman could do just as well in the Grand Prix tour as the men who they were competing against for the Overall Award, so there was no need for a separate award. In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Smith's name and picture. Around the beginning of 1981, Smith was hired as a rider at Windrush Farms, in Litchfield, CT. She stayed on this farm for the rest of her competition years.\nCareer in show jumping competition.\nSmith Taylor had two different mounts at the beginning of her career on the Grand Prix Tour, Radnor II, and then Val de Loir. While riding Radnor II, Smith was named to the second reserve position for the 1976 U.S. Olympic Team. Val de Loir won the AGA horse of the year the same year that Smith won the Lady's and Overall Awards, 1978. Smith was riding Val de Loir when she was on the gold medal team in the Pan American games in 1979. Smith switched mounts soon afterwards to a bay Dutch show jumping horse named Calypso. Calypso's sire was a Dutch show jumper as well, named Lucky Boy, who sired several other successful jumpers. Calypso was a smaller horse for show jumping, at just over 16 hands, but together, he and Smith won many competitions during the years they competed in show jumping. Calypso and Smith became the only horse-rider team ever to win all three parts in the triple crown of show jumping competition; The American Invitational, The International Jumping Derby, and the American Gold Cup.\nIn 1980, Smith and Calypso won a bronze medal in the Alternate Olympics. She qualified for the Olympics again four years later in Los Angeles, and it was there that Smith and Calypso helped the United States Equestrian Team win their first Olympic Gold medal in the sport. Calypso had been injured going into this competition, but he still performed spectacularly. In 1980 she placed second in the World Cup on Calypso, and at the 1982 World Cup, she won. She also rode Calypso to help the U.S. team win the Nations Cup and the World Cup in 1983. (Calypso sports hall of fame)Smith retired when Windrush Farm, the farm she had been riding for, went bankrupt. She then moved to Tennessee and married Lee Taylor. Calypso was purchased by Smith's husband, Lee Taylor, as a wedding present and brought to their Wildwood Farm in Tennessee to live there in retirement from 1988-2002. Calypso died at age 29 after a long and successful career and a peaceful retirement together with his rider, Smith.\nCareer after retirement from show jumping.\nSmith Taylor retired from show jumping competition around the same time that Calypso did: 1987, but she did not retire from working for and with horses and their riders. She commentated for NBC and NBCSN for major televised show jumping events, including the Olympics. She also designed some courses herself for show jumping, judged for various hunter/jumper events, and wrote a book about her life with horses called \"Riding With Life: Lessons from the Horse\". Through all of these activities, Smith has continued to work with horses directly. With her husband Lee as a partner, Smith has bred many thoroughbred horses for show jumping, but also for hunting and polo. Smith has also worked for the younger generation of show jumping riders and young horse enthusiasts. Smith was the coach for the Developing Rider Tours from 2007-2008. The U.S. Equestrian team named her the Developmental Coach of the Year in 2007. Around the same time period, she also worked with the Hunter Jumper Association on their Emerging Athlete's Program. After her husband Lee Taylor died, Smith started the program for teaching young riders that she and her husband had always hoped for. The program, called TaylorMade Horsemanship, is taught by Smith at various locations around the U.S., with the aim of helping riders get better at their sport through improving their physical skill, as well as their ability to communicate and understand their mounts. Smith has led several similar horsemanship improvement clinics on riding and jumping at her Wildwood Farm in Germantown, Tennessee as well.\nWildwood Farm.\nWildwood Farm is a 350 acre farm off of Germantown Rd. in Germantown, owned by Smith Taylor and her husband Lee Taylor. The farm has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 2017. It has large fields for the American Thoroughbred horses that are bred there, as well as a 18,000 square ft. stable block. Smith lived at Wildwood Farm following her marriage to Taylor. Lee Taylor bought Calypso for Smith in 1987 as a wedding present and he was brought home to live at Wildwood Farm with them in his retirement years. Calypso died when he was 29 after fourteen years of peaceful retirement on the farm. Smith and her husband lived at Wildwood Farm together since 1989, breeding horses and running clinics at the farm. In 2005, Lee died, but Smith continues to live on the farm, working with horses."

Under the captaincy of Frank Hill, Wales were victorious over the tourists at St. Helen's, but it was reported that on the day all Wales the back players were visibly nervous to face the tourists, except for Webb and 'Buller' Stadden. Webb had an excellent game, completing a conversion after a try from Swansea's William Towers. Webb attempted a penalty goal from the half way mark during the game, narrowly missing; and was faultless in his role as full-back, a role which he was unaccustomed. Four days later on 26 December, Webb faced the same touring team, this time as part of his club team, Newport. Facing a far larger crowd than was present at the Wales fixture, Newport lost 3 tries to nil against the far more physical Māori team.\nWebb's second and last game for Wales was in their very next match, against Scotland as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. Wales lost the match and Webb was not reselected for any future Welsh internationals.\nInternational matches played.\nWales (rugby union)"

He led the American Association with 43 home runs in 1935.\nAfter his two seasons with the Indians, totaling 23 games in which he hit .217 with 1 home run, Gill played in 1929 for the Albany Senators of the Class A Eastern League, where he hit .373 with 14 home runs. The Indians needed a right-handed hitting outfielder and were interested in bringing Gill back in 1930, but rookie Bob Seeds outperformed him in spring training and made the major-league club.\nGill was then sold to the Baltimore Orioles of the Double-A International League, where he hit 34 home runs and batted .325 that year. After hitting .344 with 23 homers in 1931, he was purchased by the Washington Senators in September and appeared in 8 games as they battled with the New York Yankees for second place in the American League.\nHe played full-time in the Class A Southern Association for the Chattanooga Lookouts for the next two seasons, hitting over .300, before returning to the Senators for 13 games in July 1934, where he hit 2 home runs and batted .245.\nGill spent most of 1935 with the Double-A Minneapolis Millers, where he led the American Association with 43 home runs.

Gill then played for the Portland Beavers of the PCL for six seasons before ending his career as a player-manager for the Union City Greyhounds and Fulton Chicks in the Class D Kentucky-Illinois-Tennessee League from 1946 to 1947."

He was considered one of the best offensive tackles in NCAA Division I-AA.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in the 1992 NFL draft due to a perceived lack of strength, Sargent signed a free agent contract with the Cincinnati Bengals. He started eight games at left tackle as a rookie in place of an injured Anthony Muñoz, whom Sargent credits for mentoring him. Sargent was named the starting left tackle ahead of the 1993 season, but broke his arm in the season opener against the Cleveland Browns, which required two surgeries. He was medically cleared to begin practicing in time for the following season's training camp.\nSargent returned from injury in 1994 and started the season as Cincinnati's starting right tackle in place of an injured Joe Walter. He was moved back to left tackle in 1995. Sargent underwent ankle surgery after the season. Furthermore, he underwent neck surgery that August to repair a herniated disk, forcing him to miss the entire 1996 season. Regardless, in early 1997, Sargent re-signed with the Bengals on a two-year, $975,000 deal. He made his return on November 2, 1997, replacing Rod Jones as the starting left tackle and helping the Bengals rush for 174 yards against the San Diego Chargers. Sargent started the last eight games of the season, helping them to a 6–2 record.\nAhead of the 1998 season, Sargent signed a four-year, $12 million contract with a $3.5 million signing bonus, making him the highest-paid offensive lineman in Bengals history. He started all 16 games that year, but was forced to retire during the 1999 preseason due to numbness and tingling in his hands, arms, and back."

        "title": "Cricket in Kenya",
        "text": "Cricket is a popular sport in Kenya. Kenya has competed in the Cricket World Cup since 1996. They upset some of the world's best teams and reached semi-finals of the 2003 tournament. They also won the inaugural World Cricket League Division 1 hosted in Nairobi and participated in the World T20. Their most successful player is Steve Tikolo, who captained the team to the semi-finals of the 2003 Cricket World Cup\nCricket has always been played only at club level in cities like Nairobi, Kisumu, Nakuru and central province. But there never was a competition where these cities played each other until the Zonal League was started.\nHistory.\nHistorical background.\nFollowing initial colonisation by the Portuguese, Kenya gradually came under British influence in the latter part of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century. Cricket was probably introduced to the country in the 1880s.\nEarly developments.\nThe first match of note was \"East African Protectorate v Rest of the World\" at Mombasa in December 1899.\nFrom 1910, a series of games called Officials v Settlers was established and ran until 1964.\nIn 1914, a Kenyan team crossed the border into Uganda and defeated their hosts by 5 wickets at Entebbe.\nGoverning body.\nCricket Kenya is the official ICC recognised organisation chosen to represent Kenya in terms of cricket issues. Kenya broke away from the East and Central Africa Cricket Conference in 1981 and joined the ICC in their own right as an Associate member. Cricket Kenya are also Associate members of the African Cricket Association.\nDomestic competitions.\nThe National cricket competition in Kenya is also known as Zonal League. It is a four team cricket competition created by Cricket Kenya featuring a Twenty20 tournament, a one day cricket tournament and finally a three-day cricket tournament. For the inaugural league four teams will be competing consisting of the 60 best players according to Cricket Kenya from Kenya.\nThe first edition of the competition involved four franchises, namely The Northern Nomads, The Eastern Aces, The Southern Stars, and The Western Chiefs. The teams were captained by National team players, Steve Tikolo, Thomas Odoyo, Kennedy Obuya, and Peter Ongondo in 2008. The inaugural T20 Competition, played in February 2008, was won by the Eastern Aces, while the first 50 over competition was won by the Northern Nomads, However the three day format of the competition was postponed due to unfavourable weather and was played in June 2008. Further difficulties in availability of players, many of whom were in school, meant that the first season of the three-dayers had to be compressed to two days per match.\nThe league was sponsored by South African Sahara Computers, African Cricket Association and others in 2008.\nFollowing a lack of interest from contracted players and insufficient funding, the league was not held in 2009 and 2010, and has been replaced in 2011 by two new competitions; the East African Cup (50 overs a side) and the East Africa Premier League (Twenty20) (see below)\nEast African Cup and East Africa Premier League.\nIn 2011, as part of a radical shakeup of cricket in the country following poor performances by the national team at the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and in response to a huge gap in standards between the national side and the country's existing leagues, Cricket Kenya launched two new franchise based competitions. Season 2011/12 saw the launch of the 50 over a side East African Cup, and the Twenty20 East Africa Premier League.\nIn addition to teams from Kenya, two teams from neighbouring Uganda were also awarded franchises, to ensure further development of playing standards, and to create more rivalry with Kenyan-based sides.\nFour teams from Kenya will participate \nand two teams from Uganda\nTeams are composed of international players, senior club players and age group cricketers aiming to make the national squads of both countries. The top two teams in each competition compete in live televised finals.\nCricket Kenya has agreed a broadcast deal with Supersport who will televise a number of live matches throughout Africa as well as a regular highlights and magazine programme.\nCricket grounds.\n \nThere are several cricket venues in Nairobi accredited with full ODI status. \nThe Ruaraka Sports Club Ground played host to the 1994 ICC Trophy final. Aga Khan Sports Club Ground and Nairobi Club Ground have hosted One Day Internationals and the Nairobi Gymkhana Club hosted two matches during the 2003 Cricket World Cup.\nThe Mombasa Sports Club ground is the only fully accredited ODI Cricket ground in Kenya outside of Nairobi. The Jaffery Sports Club Mombasa is the only cricket ground in Kenya where cricket can be played under lights. Rift Valley Sports Club in Nakuru has been given a major uplift for the under-19 world cup. Jomo Kenyatta Sports Grounds in Kisumu has got a turf wicket\nNational team.\nThe East Africa cricket team represented Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Their first game was against a South African Non-European team in 1958. Kenya was represented by the East Africa team in the 1975 World Cup and the 1979 ICC Trophies.\nThe Kenya national cricket team have One Day International status until 2013."

        "text": "The 2010 Pro Bowl was the National Football League's all-star game for the 2009 season. It took place at 8:00 PM EST on Sunday, January 31, 2010, at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, the home stadium of the Miami Dolphins and host site of Super Bowl XLIV. The television broadcasters were Mike Tirico, Ron Jaworski and Jon Gruden.\nThe AFC won the game 41–34.\nSite &amp; date changes.\nThe 2010 Pro Bowl was held on the weekend before the Super Bowl, the first time ever that the Pro Bowl was held before the championship game, and the first time that the Pro Bowl was held somewhere other than Aloha Stadium in Honolulu since 1980 (1979 season). NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the move was made after looking at alternatives to strengthen the Pro Bowl.\nThe game was moved up in order to prevent a conflict that would have taken place if the game had taken place on February 13 or 14, with the game facing against the NBA All-Star Game, Winter Olympics, and Daytona 500. Due to the change, players from the conference championship teams, who were going to play in the Super Bowl the following week—the Indianapolis Colts and New Orleans Saints—did not participate. As a result, for the first time in Pro Bowl history, rosters for the AFC and NFC teams were not allowed to include any players from the teams that would be playing in the Super Bowl to avoid major injuries to members of either team. However, these players were still required to be on site for the Pro Bowl to collect a bonus payment from the NFL.\nSeveral NFL players spoke out against the decision regarding timing of the game; ten-time Pro Bowl quarterback Peyton Manning raised issue with the possibility that if the concept of rotating the location of the game were to continue, the 2012 game could be held in a cold-weather city (Indianapolis) not seen as a winter vacation destination. NBC sportscaster Al Michaels was skeptical of the changes, telling the \"Honolulu Star-Bulletin\" that \"the [NFL] thinks playing it before the Super Bowl will add to the buzz. It won't.\" Indianapolis Colts president Bill Polian also came out against the change, explaining that it seemed disruptive and \"stupid\" to have players voted to the Pro Bowl, only to have to sit out because they're playing in the Super Bowl, but still have to show up to the game to collect a bonus payment.\nBroadcasting.\nESPN aired the game instead of CBS, which aired the 52nd Grammy Awards that evening.\nThe game was the first Pro Bowl to be legally broadcast on internet radio. As part of a catch in the league's broadcast contracts, the Pro Bowl has, to this point, never been broadcast on the NFL's FieldPass system due to it being broadcast exclusively by Westwood One. The NFL had negotiated internet broadcast rights with all 32 of its teams, but never did so with Westwood One (since it was seen as redundant); since none of the 32 teams actually play in the Pro Bowl, FieldPass did not hold rights. When contracts were renegotiated in 2009, Westwood One's broadcasts were added to FieldPass, and along with it, play-by-play of the Pro Bowl. The Sports USA Radio Network provided the commentary for Westwood One, with SUSA's Larry Kahn on play-by-play and Dan Fouts sharing color commentary with Westwood One's Boomer Esiason.\nNFC roster.\nSpecial teams.\nNotes:"

        "text": "Frank Hill (13 January 1866 – 20 April 1927) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Cardiff. Hill won 15 caps for Wales over a period of ten years and was given the team captaincy on four occasions.\nHill was baptised as Alperus Frank Hill according to parish records in Llandaff, and was later educated at Clifton College. He was a solicitor by trade, and had a practice on Cardiff High Street.\nInternational career.\nHill was first selected for Wales in a match against Scotland as part of the 1885 Home Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Newport's Charlie Newman, the game was a dull scoreless draw caused by Welsh attempts to kill the game at any opportunity. Hill played in both Welsh matches of the 1886 Championship, but was not chosen during the next year's tournament. In 1888 Hill experienced his first international win, when he was part of the Wales team that beat Scotland at Rodney Parade. Wales won by a single try, scored by Thomas Pryce-Jenkins in the first half before using the same spoiling tactics they employed in 1885 to prevent Scotland from scoring.\nIn December 1888, Hill was selected to captain Wales against the first Southern Hemisphere touring team to Britain when he faced the New Zealand Māoris. Wales employed the four threequarters system during the game, the first time since it was abandoned after the failure of the tactic against Scotland in 1886. The Welsh were victorious and Hill was given the captaincy for the opening game of the 1889 Home Nations Championship to Scotland. Wales lost the game and Hill was replaced for the final game of the season to Ireland by Daniel Griffiths. Hill regained his position and his captaincy in the first match of the 1890 tournament, though missed the away match to England. When he was reselected for the final game of the championship the captaincy was passed to Arthur Gould.\nHill missed the next two tournaments, before playing the entirety of the 1893 tournament which saw Wales win all their matches to take the Triple Crown for the first time. The next season was Hill's last as an international player and although only one of the team that won the Triple Crown the previous year was not reselected, the team was not harmonious. Gould and Hill fell out over scrummaging tactics against England, causing Hill to work against his own packleader, Jim Hannan, resulting in a massive English victory. Hill's final game was a loss to Ireland in Belfast, in which Hill was given the captaincy.\nInternational matches played.\nWales\nAs referee.\nIn 1889 Hill refereed the encounter between Oxford University and the touring New Zealand Māoris."

At one point considered the second largest in the United States and one of the largest combat sport promotions in the world, Bellator's first event was held in 2009, and the promotion has since held over 300 \"numbered\" events. The promotion takes its name from \"bellātor\", the Latin word for \"warrior\".\nParamount Global (formerly Viacom) purchased majority ownership of Bellator from founder Bjorn Rebney in 2011, with Paramount's television networks serving as the promotion's media partners in the United States. On November 20, 2023, after Bellator's then-broadcaster Showtime announced the discontinuation of its sports division, Bellator MMA was acquired by the Professional Fighters League; PFL plans to maintain the Bellator brand for selected events, and allow its roster to compete in PFL events.\nHistory.\nBellator was founded in 2008 by Chairman and CEO Bjorn Rebney. Under Rebney's ownership, Bellator events were structured around single-elimination tournaments. In December 2011, Viacom purchased majority ownership of Bellator.\nIn May 2014, Bellator hosted the company's inaugural pay-per-view event from the Landers Center.\nIn June 2014, it was announced that both Chairman/CEO Bjorn Rebney and President Tim Danaher were relieved of their positions. Rebney was succeeded by Strikeforce founder Scott Coker. Under Coker, Bellator would drop its season-long tournament format in early 2015, transitioning into more of a traditional, single-fight event schedule. Since 2018, Bellator hosts divisional grand-prix tournaments.\nBroadcast partners.\nSince the fourth season in 2011, Bellator cards have been predominantly broadcast on Viacom-owned networks in the United States. Beginning in January 2013, Bellator telecasts were moved from MTV2 to Spike (later relaunched as Paramount Network in 2018) following the end of the latter channel's partnership with the UFC.

The 30-game fifth set in the men's final was the longest set in Wimbledon finals history.\nCentre Court roof.\nThe 2009 Championships took place during an extended period of hot, dry weather in southeast England, meaning that it was not until day seven of the tournament (29 June) that the newly constructed Centre Court roof was closed for the first time due to rain, delaying a fourth round match between Amélie Mauresmo and Dinara Safina. The following match between Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka was the first full match to be played under the new roof; owing to the new floodlights, the match continued until 22:38, the latest ever finish in Wimbledon history (this record was broken in 2012 in a third round match between Andy Murray and Marcos Baghdatis, which ended at 23:02).

        "text": "Ross Smith (born 12 January 1989) is an English professional darts player who plays in events of the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). He was the winner of the 2022 European Championship.\nCareer.\nSmith began playing in Professional Darts Corporation events in 2005 and made his debut in the Vauxhall Spring Open, reaching the last 16. Smith then reached the final of the WDF Europe Youth Cup, losing to Dutchman Johnny Nijs. Smith had little success afterwards on the PDC circuit and switched to the BDO in 2007. He reached the last 16 of the 2008 British Classic and the 2008 Czech Open.\nSmith qualified for the 2009 BDO World Darts Championship, winning one of five places in the qualifiers in Bridlington. He gained victories over Stuart Kellet, Kevin Simm and Henny van der Ster before beating Scotland's Don Haughton to qualify. He faced Scott Waites in the first round, losing 3–0.\nIn the 2011 BDO World Darts Championship, he beat Tony O'Shea 3–1 in the first round and Willy van de Wiel 4–1 in the second round, before losing to eventual champion Martin Adams 1–5 in the quarter finals. It was announced at the end of the 2012 BDO World Championship that Ross would be one of many players to compete in the rival PDC's 'Q School' the following season. He earned a tour card through the qualifiers Order of Merit. His best result of 2012 came just one week later as he reached the quarter-finals of the second Players Championship and lost 3–6 to Justin Pipe.\nSmith qualified for three of the five new European Tour events, but lost in the first round on each occasion. He came very close to defeating world number 5 Simon Whitlock in the third event, the European Darts Open as he led 5–2, but went on to lose 5–6.\nSmith headed into 2013 ranked world number 79, and reached his first semi-final on the PDC tour in April at the seventh UK Open Qualifier, where he lost 6–3 to John Part. At the UK Open itself, he fought back from 7–4 down in the third round against Jelle Klaasen to level at 7–7, before being edged out 9–7. He threw a nine-dart finish in the second round of the Gibraltar Darts Trophy against Adrian Lewis, but lost 5–6; this remained the last nine-dart finish achieved on the PDC European Tour until June 2018. Smith won four events on the PDC Challenge Tour during 2013 to top the Order of Merit which has earned him a place in the Grand Slam of Darts and the 2014 World Championship and also a two year PDC tour card which includes all of his 2014 entry fees. In the Grand Slam he lost each of his three games to Simon Whitlock, Wes Newton and Mark Webster to finish bottom of Group G. He played Whitlock in the first round of the World Championship and was beaten 3–0 in sets.\nHe began 2014 at 54th place in the rankings meaning he rose 25 positions during the previous year. He lost 9–5 in the third round of the UK Open to Kim Huybrechts. Smith's only quarter-final showing of the year came at the 19th Players Championship where he lost 6–3 to Gerwyn Price. He missed out on qualifying for the 2015 World Championship by just £500 on the Pro Tour Order of Merit.\nSmith saw off Kevin Thomas at the German Darts Championship and came from 4–1 behind against Peter Wright in the second round to force a deciding leg in which he missed one match dart to lose 6–5. 2015 proved to be a difficult year for Smith as he could only record one more last 32 finish out of the events he played in. Smith explained that the birth of his child and starting a new job had left him with no time to practice. He fell to 74th on the Order of Merit meaning he needed to enter 2016 Q School. Smith hit a nine darter on the first day and on the final day eliminated seven players, concluding with a 5–4 victory over Mick McGowan to win a new two-year tour card and stated that his goal was to get in the top 40 in the rankings.\nHe failed to qualify for the 2016 UK Open and reached the last 32 of an event for the only time this year at the fourth Players Championship event by beating Peter Wright and Dennis Smith, before losing 6–2 Rowby-John Rodriguez. He reached the main draw of the Gibraltar Darts Trophy and Austrian Darts Open, but was eliminated in the first round of both.\nAfter 2017, during which he took a break from playing darts, he lost his PDC Tour card.\nIn 2018 he won his Tour card back and in 2019 he reached the world championship where he defeated Paul Lim in the first round, but lost to Daryl Gurney in the second round. He also qualified for the UK Open in 2019 where he reached the quarter finals after defeating Dawson Murschell, Yordi Meeuwisse, Alan Norris, Steve West and James Wade.\nIn the same year, he also qualified for 2019 European Championship and he defeated in the first round the first seed and the current world number one, Michael van Gerwen 5–6. In the second round he lost to Ricky Evans. For the first time since 2013, he also qualified for 2019 Grand Slam of Darts when he was successful in PDC Qualifying Event. He was unable to win any match in his group that also contained Michael van Gerwen, Adrian Lewis and Jim Williams. For the second time in a row, he also qualified for 2019 Players Championship Finals, but he was eliminated in the first round, losing to Brendan Dolan.\nSmith qualified for 2020 PDC World Darts Championship as the 10th highest ranked player via Pro Tour Order of Merit. However, he lost 0–3 to the debutant Ciaran Teehan from Ireland. After the championship, Smith placed 48th in PDC Order of Merit, his highest year end ranking ever, and secured his Tour card for another season.\nHe was seeded into the third round of 2020 UK Open, but lost in his first match against Jamie Lewis 5–6. Even though the European Tour was cut short due to COVID-19, he qualified for 2020 European Championship, but lost in the deciding leg to Michael Smith. Smith had his best run in 2020 Players Championship Finals, reaching the third round after wins over Kim Huybrechts and Nathan Aspinall, before losing to Damon Heta.\nAt the end of 2020, he qualified for his third world championship in a row, 2021 PDC World Darts Championship, as fourth highest ranked player from Pro Tour Order of Merit.\nIn October 2022, Smith reached his first televised major final, defeating Michael Smith 11–8 to win a first major title at the 2022 European Championship. During the group stage of the 2022 Grand Slam of Darts, Smith hit nine 180s in his victory over Michael van Gerwen, a record number for a group stage for the Grand Slam. Smith's year ended with a Third Round World Championship defeat to Dirk van Duijvenbode in a sudden death leg, having missed five match darts. The match featured 31 180s, a record for a best of seven set match, nineteen of which from Smith which equalled the individual record for a match of this format.\nSmith won a second PDC ProTour title in March 2023 with victory at Player Championship 5, defeating Gary Anderson 8–6 in the final. The win took him into the Order of Merit's top 16 for the first time in his career. He won a second ProTour title of the year in October 2023 at Player Championship 28, ensuring his position as the third-most in form player in the world over the previous 200 legs played ahead of his European Championship title defence in Germany.\nAt the 2024 European Darts Grand Prix, Smith survived ten match darts across the tournament as he reached a first European Tour final, where he lost 8–6 to Gary Anderson.\nPerformance timeline.\nBDO\nPDC\nPDC European Tour"

        "title": "1930 World Snooker Championship",
        "text": "The 1930 World Snooker Championship, known at the time as the Professional Championship of Snooker, was a snooker tournament held between 17 March and 23 May 1930 at various venues in England, with the final taking place from 19 to 24 May at Thurston's Hall, London. Defending champion Joe Davis won the title for the fourth time by defeating Tom Dennis by 25 to 12 in the final.\nIt was the fourth edition of the World Snooker Championship organised by the Billiards Association and Control Council. Six players participated in the tournament. One first round match was held at Newman's Club, London, and the venue for the other first round match and the semi-finals was Camkin's Hall, Birmingham. The highest of the tournament was 79, a new championship record, compiled by Davis in the 12th frame of the final. Davis won both of his matches in the tournament by margins that meant the last day of play scheduled was not required. It was the third time in four years that Dennis was runner-up.\nBackground.\nProfessional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis had noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiard hall manager Bill Camkin, who had also seen snooker's increasing appeal, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. The inaugural event was won by Davis, who defeated Tom Dennis 20–11 in the final. Originally called the Professional Championship of Snooker, the annual competition was not titled the World Championship until 1935, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship.\nThe 1930 Championship was the fourth staging of the championship, the three previous editions all having been won by Davis. The closing date for entries for the 1930 tournament was 30 November 1929. The entry fee was set at five guineas per player (), with a five guineas sidestake required for each match.\nAll matches apart from the final were to be best of 25 , played over three days, with the final contested over 49 frames across six days, an increase from 33 the previous year. The championship conditions stipulated that Thurston's Hall was to be the venue for the final, which was expected to take place straight after the conclusion of the Professional Championship of English Billiards. For pre-final matches, the players concerned were to arrange the dates and venues. Entry fees would be used to provide prize money for the finalists, with 60 per cent going to the champion, and gate receipts for each match would be divided equally, after expenses (including 2.5 per cent of the gross receipts for the BACC), between the two players concerned.\nThere were six entries for the Championship: Joe Davis, Tom Newman, Alec Mann, Fred Lawrence, Tom Dennis and Nat Butler. The draw for the competition was made on 14 January 1930 at the BACC's offices in Cecil Chambers, Strand, London. The two first round matches were between Mann and Lawrence, and Newman and Butler. Davis and Dennis received byes into the semi-finals.\nSummary.\nFirst round.\nNewman met Butler at Newman's Club in St John's Wood, London. Butler was 3–1 ahead after the first afternoon session, but Newman took all four frames in the evening to lead 5–3 on the first day. After the next afternoon session, Newman was still two frames clear at 7–5, and he won all four frames in the evening to make it 11–5. There was just one session on the following two days. Butler won all four frames on the third day and then won the first four frames on the final day to win 13–11.\nLawrence and Alec Mann played their first round match in Birmingham. After taking the first frame, Lawrence won the second by over 100 , and the third on a . Lawrence won all eight frames on the first day, playing cautiously, including taking two and a half minutes deliberating over a particular . On the second afternoon, with Lawrence seemingly lacking the level of concentration that he had shown the previous day, Mann won all four frames. The players shared the four frames in an evening session that lasted nearly two and a half hours, ending with Lawrence Lawrence 10–6 ahead. Playing confidently, Mann won all four frames of the final afternoon to level the match at 10–10, including the twentieth which he won on the final after Lawrence had failed in an attempt to it. Lawrence took the first three frames in the evening to progress to the semi-finals 13–11.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first semi-final commenced on 23 April. Davis won the first four frames against Lawrence in 65 minutes, compiling of 58, 50, 48, 44 and 37 in the process. W.W. Thornton wrote in the Birmingham Daily Gazette that this was \"a performance which I can not recollect having been equalled by Davis himself or any other player under championship conditions, and described Lawrence during the session as \"an amazed spectator.\" This was followed by Davis winning all four of the first day's evening frames to lead 8–0. Although Davis did not play to the same standard on the second afternoon, he again took all four frames for 12–0, playing some shots with his left hand rather than his normal right. The thirteenth frame was won by Lawrence, who added the fourteenth by winning it on the final black ball before Davis secured victory at 13–2 with a day to spare. On the 25th, the pair played exhibition matches of billiards, over 75 minutes with Davis to win only if he scored twice as many points as Lawrence, and snooker. Davis won the afternoon billiards match 571–271, but lost the evening one (under the conditions agreed) by outscoring Lawrence 578–368, and won both frames of snooker played in each session.\nButler won the first two frames of his semi-final against Dennis on 1 May, with the first session ending level at 2–2. The pattern was repeated in the second session, with Butler taking a 4–2 lead then Dennis equalising. Dennis held a 10–6 lead after the second day. The first three frames of the final day were won by Butler to close to 9–10, before Dennis won the twentieth frame. In the concluding session, Dennis increased his lead to 12–9, then butler won the 22nd frame by a single point and added the next to move within one frame. Dennis secured victory at 13–11 by winning the 24th frame 60–34.\nOn 17 May, Davis won the Professional Championship of English Billiards for the third year in a row, defeating Newman 20,918–20,117 at Thurston's Hall.\nFinal.\nThe final was scheduled to be played from Monday 19 May to Saturday 24 May and was over 49 frames. Davis had won the title each year since the championship's inception in 1927, whilst Dennis had been the runner-up in two of those three years. There were eight frames played each day with four frames in the afternoon and four in the evening (five on the final day). The match was held at Thurston's Hall. Davis led 6–2 at the end of the first day, winning both sessions 3–1. The report in the \"Sheffield Daily Telegraph\" stated that Davis had been \"very lucky\" to win three of the four evening frames, despite the high standard of his potting, as Dennis' tactical play represented \"clever snooker.\" Davis won all four frames on the second afternoon but the evening session was split 2–2 to leave Davis 12–4 ahead. In the last frame of the afternoon session Davis scored a championship record break of 79. The \"Sheffield Daily Telegraph\" account of the match praised Davis' potting and positional play.\nOn the third day, Davis won the afternoon session 3–1, and after the players shared the frames in the evening session, Davis led 17–7 overnight. Each player won two frames on the fourth afternoon session but Davis won three in evening to lead 22–10. The fifth afternoon session was shared to leave Davis 24–12, needing just one more frame, with Davis recording a 70 break in the second frame of the day. Davis took the first frame in the evening to win 25–12, winning a day early and claiming the title for the fourth time. The championship trophy and medals were presented by John C. Bisset, chairman of the BACC.\nMain draw.\nMatch results are shown below. Winning players and scores are denoted in bold text."

        "title": "Alan Norris (darts player)",
        "text": "Alan Norris (born 21 February 1972) is an English darts player. He was the runner-up at the 2014 BDO World Darts Championship and also lost in the final of the 2012 Zuiderduin Masters, with Stephen Bunting prevailing on both occasions. In 2015, he switched to the PDC and, after reaching the quarter-finals of the 2016 World Championship, he was named the PDC Best Newcomer of the year.\nBDO career.\nNorris won the 2007 Sweden National Championships, beating Daniel Larsson in the final. He had earlier reached the semi-finals of the Finnish Open. Norris then narrowly missed out qualifying for the last 16 of the 2007 Winmau World Masters, having beaten Michael Rosenauer, Mitchell Crooks and Daniel Brouwer before losing to Jordy Terburg. A quarter-final defeat in the Swedish Open followed.\nNorris made his televised debut by reaching the quarter-finals of the 2008 Welsh Open, which was shown live on Setanta Sports. He defeated Martin Adams in the earlier rounds and then went on to beat Ian Jones, before losing to eventual winner Gary Anderson in the semi-finals. He then reached the quarter-finals of the Norway Open, Denmark Open and the Zuiderduin Masters and also reached the semi-finals of the Welsh Classic and the Swedish Open.\nNorris made his World Championship debut in 2009, taking one of the automatic non-seeded spots. He defeated 13th seed Steve West 3–0 in the first round but lost 4–0 to fourth seed Scott Waites in the second round. He was defeated in the final of the Welsh Classic 5–2 by Tony O'Shea. Norris advanced through Group B at the Zuiderduin Masters and then eliminated Martin Atkins 3–1 to play in his first major semi-final where Darryl Fitton whitewashed him 4–0.\nNorris returned as the eighth seed at the 2010 World Championship, but lost 3–2 to Robert Wagner in the first round despite averaging 90 compared to Wagner's 86. He had a mixed 2010 season, in which he won the French Open by beating Kim Huybrechts and also got to the semi-finals of the European Open in Airdrie. Norris attempted to qualify for the UK Open but fell in the last 64 to Ryan Murray.\nIn the first round of the 2011 World Championship, Norris beat seventh seed Ross Montgomery 3–1, but was beaten in the second round by 10th seed Garry Thompson. He edged out Dean Winstanley 6–5 to win the England Open Early Bird and retained his French Open title by defeating Garry Thompson 5–3. Norris also claimed the Luxembourg Open after beating Christian Kist 6–4.\nNorris played in his fourth successive World Championship in 2012 and once again won his first round match, this time against 14th seed Benito van de Pas 3–2. In the second round, he recovered from 3–1 down against third seed Dean Winstanley to win 4–3 and reach his first World Championship quarter-final, where he was beaten 5–1 by eventual champion Christian Kist. Norris had a shot at double 12 for a nine-dart finish, which would have been only the second in the history of the tournament, but missed the shot and ended up losing the leg. He won the Welsh Masters and the Luxembourg Open for the second year in a row. In December, Norris reached the final of the Zuiderduin Masters, a run that included a 112 three-dart average in his final group match as well as two 170 checkouts. However, he was eventually beaten 5–0 by BDO number one Stephen Bunting in the final.\nNorris was then the number nine seed for the 2013 World Championship. He beat Welshman Wayne Warren in the first round 3–1, however, was beaten in a tightly contested second round game, losing 4–3 to eighth seeded Dutchman, Wesley Harms.\nWorld Championship final.\nAfter a slow season, Norris entered the 2014 World Championship as an unseeded player and was drawn against defending champion Scott Waites in the first round. Norris won the match 3–0 averaging over 93 and with a checkout success of almost 50%. He followed this up with another clinical performance in a 4–1 win over Glen Durrant, before beating James Wilson 5–2 in a match described by commentators as one of the best in Lakeside history due to its consistently high scoring. In the semi-finals, Norris trailed Jan Dekker 4–2 after missing three darts to lead 3–1, but eventually won the match 6–5 after Dekker himself missed set darts in the ninth set that would have seen him lead 5–4. Both players hit a number of crucial finishes, most notably Dekker hitting a 158 checkout to hold his throw in the deciding set which would otherwise have seen Norris throw for the match, and the game was cited as the best in that year's tournament by Bobby George among others. Norris played world number one Stephen Bunting in the final and kept the match tight in the first session, entering the interval at 3–3 in sets having seen Bunting miss darts to win two of the sets Norris won. In the seventh set, Norris missed one dart at double four to lead 4–3 having also earlier thrown for the set, then missed darts at doubles in the first two legs of the eighth as Bunting moved into a 6–3 lead. Norris hit back by winning the tenth set courtesy of a 140 checkout, the highest of the match and also Norris's highest of the tournament. Then, as Bunting threw for the title at 2–0 in the 11th set and left himself on 28 for the match, Norris hit a 113 checkout to stay alive. However, Bunting subsequently broke Norris's throw and won the championship. Norris received £35,000 for reaching the final.\nThe rest of the year proved to be Norris' most successful as he won the Denmark Open, Polish Open, British Classic, Swedish Open, Scottish Classic and Catalan Open. His appearance in the World Championship final earned him a debut at the Grand Slam of Darts where he topped Group B by beating Ronny Huybrechts and Terry Jenkins. In the last 16 Kim Huybrechts knocked Norris out 10–5.\nPDC career.\nAfter the culmination of the 2015 BDO World Championship, where Norris lost to Darryl Fitton in the second round after missing three match darts, Norris confirmed his intention to enter the PDC's Q School, ending a nine-year stint with the BDO. He stated that \"I've done the BDO circuit for a long time and nothing seems to be changing quickly enough. I'm not getting any younger, so it’s the right time to give the PDC a go. I've spoken to them (BDO Events) on a number of occasions and they haven’t been able to give me straight answers, there’s nothing on paper in terms of new events and so on. It's the same story every year and sometimes a change is as good as a rest, so I'm going to give it a go with PDC\".\nNorris won a Tour Card on the first day of the event by beating Carl Abbiss 5–3 in the final qualifying round. He also threw a nine-dart finish earlier in the day during his fifth round victory over Jason Lovett. Norris' first quarter-final appearance in the PDC came at the final UK Open Qualifier in February where he lost 6–1 to Phil Taylor. He entered the UK Open itself in the third round stage and lost 9–6 to Kyle Anderson.\nIn October, Norris claimed his first PDC title at the 18th Players Championship event by defeating Kim Huybrechts 6–1 in the final with an average of 108.06. He lost 6–3 to Peter Wright in the first round of the European Championship and beat Terry Jenkins 6–3 at the 2015 Players Championship Finals, but was then thrashed 10–3 by Adrian Lewis in the second round.\nNorris finished as the highest non-qualified player on the Pro Tour Order of Merit for the 2016 World Championship and on his debut in the event he knocked out sixth seed Robert Thornton 3–0 in sets. His form continued as he scored 11 180s in a 4–1 win over Joe Murnan to meet Mark Webster in the third round, who he also defeated 4–1. Norris moved 3–1 up on Jelle Klaasen in the quarter-finals, before being pegged back to 3–3. He won the next set and then missed a dart at double 12 for a nine-dart finish. Norris threw for the match but would ultimately be defeated 5–4, losing the final five legs of the match. He was ranked 37th on the Order of Merit afterwards, the highest of 2015's Q School graduates and was named best newcomer at the PDC Annual Awards Dinner. Norris lost 6–4 in the final of the second UK Open Qualifier to Michael van Gerwen. He reached the fourth round of the main event, but lost 9–6 to Joe Cullen. Norris qualified for his first World Matchplay and won the opening leg against Gary Anderson, but was defeated 10–1. On his World Grand Prix debut he overcame Michael Smith 2–1 and was a leg away from knocking out Simon Whitlock in a deciding set, before the Australian won the match.\nNorris won his first European Tour title by narrowly defeating Jelle Klaasen 6–5 in the final of the German Darts Championship. The win gave him entry into the Grand Slam of Darts, but he failed to win any of his games to finish bottom of the group. Norris earned £35,000 for throwing a nine-dart finish in his first round win over Michael Smith at the Players Championship Finals. He reached the third round, where he lost 10–5 to Darren Webster.\nIn the first round of the 2017 World Championship, Norris overturned a 2–0 deficit against John Michael to win 3–2. He lost the first 10 legs in the second round against Raymond van Barneveld and would lose 4–0. Norris was ranked 18th on the Order of Merit after the event. Norris won his third PDC title by overcoming Peter Jacques 6–1 in the first Players Championship.\nHe got to the quarter-finals of the 2017 UK Open with a 10–6 win over Michael Smith and survived two match darts from Kim Huybrechts to progress to the semi-finals 10–9. In another close match Norris was level with Gerwyn Price at 9–9 and missed three darts to take the 19th leg. Price won it by taking out 100 with two double tops and then broke Norris in the next leg to inflict an 11–9 defeat on him."

        "title": "Robert Vaden (basketball)",
        "text": "Robert Anthony Vaden (born March 3, 1985) is an American former professional basketball player. Previously he played for the Erie BayHawks of the NBA Development League. Vaden played college basketball with the Indiana Hoosiers and the UAB Blazers for two years each. After four years in college, he was drafted by the Charlotte Bobcats with the 54th pick in the 2009 NBA draft. After the draft, his draft rights were immediately traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder. However, the Thunder did not sign him to a contract. As a result, he went on to play in Italy, Slovakia, and in the NBA Development League with the Tulsa 66ers, the D-League team affiliated with the Thunder.\nHigh school career.\nRobert Vaden attended Cathedral High School and Pike High School in Indianapolis, Indiana and Bridgton Academy in Bridgton, Maine. As a senior at Bridgton Academy, Vaden averaged 26 points and 8 rebounds per game, leading the team to a 27–7 record. He played his freshman and sophomore years at Cathedral, before leaving due to a dispute between his parental guardian and the school. He went on to play his junior year at Pike, where he led the Red Devils to an undefeated record (29-0) and the Indiana Class 4A title. He averaged 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 2.9 assists per game.\nConsidered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Vaden was listed as the No. 8 small forward and the No. 38 player in the nation in 2004.\nCollege career.\nVaden began his career at Indiana University, where he started every game in his first two years. In his freshman season, he led the Hoosiers in minutes played (980), free throw percentage (.803), and steals per game (1.55 – fifth in the Big Ten). He was the team's third-leading scorer (10.5) and rebounder (4.3).\nIn his sophomore campaign, Vaden emerged as one of the top players in the Big Ten. He finished second on the team in scoring (13.5) and rebounding (5.5), while leading the squad in assists (109) and steals (38). The season featured many memorable moments for Vaden, as he had a streak of 12 consecutive three-pointers over a three-game stretch – only three short of the NCAA record. He also set the IU record for three-point percentage in a game, hitting 6–6 in a 12/31/05 game against Ball State. Another high point came in the 2006 NCAA Tournament, where Vaden hit the game-winning three-pointer to lift the Hoosiers over San Diego State in the first round.\nAt the end of the 2005–06 season, Indiana coach Mike Davis was fired after failing to live up to the high Hoosier expectations, and later accepted the head coaching post at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Vaden had grown close to his coach when Davis had supported him through his father's death after his freshman year at Indiana and chose to transfer to UAB to continue playing for him.\nAfter sitting out the 2006–07 season due to NCAA transfer policy, Robert Vaden had a breakout junior year, logging one of the best seasons ever for a UAB player. He averaged 21.1 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game on the way to first team all-conference honors and being named the Conference USA Newcomer of the year. He set school records for points in a season (695), three-pointers made (142) and three-pointers attempted (355). His 142 three-pointers made were also a conference record and placed him second in the nation in this category. He also holds the UAB career record for scoring average (minimum 25 games) entering his senior year. On February 27, 2008, Vaden hit for 41 points, his career high, in a game against UTEP.\nVaden finished his college career with 2,010 points and hit 379 three-pointers in his career – good for #10 in NCAA history. He owns the UAB single-season records for points, three-pointers made, and attempted and is the school single-game record holder in points (41 – tied with Andy Kennedy), three-point field goals (9), and free throw percentage (11-11, tied with two others).\nProfessional career.\nVaden was automatically eligible for the 2009 NBA draft after finishing his four-year college eligibility. He was projected to be either a second-round pick or undrafted free agent. He was eventually drafted by the Charlotte Bobcats with the 54th pick in the draft and his rights were immediately traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for cash considerations. He then played for the Thunder in both 2009 Orlando Summer League and NBA Summer League. He played in all five games in Orlando, averaging 3.0 points in 19.1 minutes per game. He improved his performance in the NBA Summer League, playing in all five games and averaging 7.8 points in 23.0 minutes per game. However, the Thunder didn't sign him to a contract and Vaden weighed the option to play overseas.\nBefore the training camp began, Vaden signed a contract with Italian second division team Aget Imola. On October 11, he scored 15 points in his first game for Imola, a 73–72 win over Sassari. He played in 29 games and averaged 16.9 points on 40 percent shooting in 35.7 minutes per game.\nAfter one season in Italy, Vaden returned to the U.S. to participate in the 2010 Orlando Summer League with the Thunder. He played in all five games, averaging 4.6 points in 21.0 minutes per game. However, he didn't receive a contract offer or an invitation to the Thunder's training camp for the 2010–11 season.\nHe then signed a contract to play in the NBA Development League (D-League) and became eligible for the 2010 D-League Draft. On November 1, 2010, Vaden was selected seventh overall by the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. On the next day, he was traded to the Tulsa 66ers, the D-League affiliate of the Thunder, in exchange for Mustafa Shakur. He played 45 games for the 66ers during the season, averaging 10.4 points on 39.2 percent shooting in 28.0 minutes per game. On April 9, 2011, after helping the 66ers win the first round of the D-League Playoffs against the Texas Legends, he was signed by the Thunder and was immediately assigned back to the 66ers. After the 66ers was eliminated from the second round of the playoffs, he was recalled by the Thunder.\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, Vaden played for BK SPU Nitra of Slovak basketball league on a three-month contract with an option to return to the NBA after the lockout ends.\nOn December 13, 2011, the Thunder traded Vaden along with two future draft picks to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Lazar Hayward. After the trade, Vaden was immediately waived by the Timberwolves.\nOn August 3, 2012, Vaden signed with Telekom Baskets Bonn of Germany's Basketball Bundesliga.\nIn 2013, Vaden signed with Belfius Mons-Hainaut of Belgium for the 2013–14 season.\nOn October 24, 2014, Vaden signed with the San Antonio Spurs. However, he was waived by the Spurs the next day. On November 1, 2014, he was selected by the Bakersfield Jam with the eighth overall pick in the 2014 NBA D-League draft. On January 20, 2015, he was traded to the Westchester Knicks in exchange for the returning player rights to Josh Owens. On February 13, 2015, he was waived by Westchester due to a season-ending injury.\nOn October 31, 2016, Vaden was re-acquired by the Westchester Knicks. On December 22, he was waived by Westchester after 11 games. On January 23, 2017, Vaden was acquired by the Erie BayHawks of the NBA Development League. On March 28, 2017, he was waived by the BayHawks due to a season-ending concussion.\nPersonal life.\nHe has two children, Brooke and Blake."

Raftery was 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighed 175 pounds.\nCareer.\nRaftery was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1881. He started his professional baseball career in 1904 with the New England League's Haverhill Hustlers. That season, he batted .288. In 1905, Raftery batted .345 in 21 games to lead the New England League in batting average. His contract was purchased by the South Atlantic League's Charleston Sea Gulls in June, and he batted .227 the rest of the year with his new team.\nRaftery had one of his best seasons while playing for Charleston in 1907. In 120 games, he batted .301 and led the South Atlantic League in batting average, hits (128), and stolen bases (80). His 80 stolen bases set a league record. In September, he was voted a gold watch for being the team's most popular player, and the Sea Gulls won the pennant that year.\nRaftery then spent one season in the Pacific Coast League before joining the Cleveland Naps for the 1909 season. He appeared in eight MLB games from April 18 to June 27 and batted .219 with three extra base hits. \"Sporting Life\" later wrote that Raftery \"did fairly well, but was not quite up to the big league requirements.\" In July, he was sold to the American Association's Toledo Mud Hens. He batted .253 for them during the rest of the season.\nFor the next four years, Raftery bounced around the minor leagues, never batting above .288.

        "text": "Tom Cosgrove (June 21, 1930 – March 27, 2017) was an American football offensive lineman. He played collegiately for the Maryland Terrapins at the University of Maryland, starting on the varsity squad from 1949 to 1952. \nIn October 1952 Cosgrove made national news as one of three Maryland players coming forward ahead of a game to expose attempted bribery in conjunction with a point shaving scandal. A fugitive wanted in the case surrendered and was arrested shortly thereafter.\nCosgrove was selected in the 13th round of the 1952 NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns. His contract was traded to the expansion Baltimore Colts, who cut him at the end of training camp ahead of their debut 1953 season.\nIn 2005 Cosgrove was inducted into the University of Maryland Athletics Hall of Fame.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nTom Cosgrove was born June 21, 1930, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended West Catholic Preparatory High School, playing a reserve role for the school football team.\nCollege career.\nCosgrove entered the University of Maryland in 1948, playing football on the freshman team. The influx of older student-athletes back from military service in World War II had worked its way through college ranks, and younger players were expected to play a more impactful role on the varsity football squad in 1949, in the estimation of \"Baltimore Sun\" sports editor Paul Menton.\nMenton was not wrong. Tom Cosgrove was inserted as a starter at center from his first game in 1949.\nIn 1950, Cosgrove was named an honorable mention All-American.\nIn the 1951 season, Cosgrove was named a second-team All-American. He was also honored with the Coaches' Award for the team's most outstanding offensive lineman.\nHe played in the 1952 Sugar Bowl at Tulane Stadium, with Maryland defeating University of Tennessee}Tennessee, 28-13.\nCosgrove and Maryland quarterback Jack Scarbath were selected to play in the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama, held January 3, 1953. The game was lost by the Marylanders and their South team, 28–13.\nCosgrove also played in the 1953 North-South Shrine Game and the College All-Star Game.\n1952 Bribery scandal.\nAlthough drafted into the NFL in January 1952, Cosgrove returned to Maryland in the fall of 1952 to play another season. In October he became the subject of national news coverage as part of a bribery scandal in which he and two of his teammates went to authorities and informed them they had been offered cash to alter the result of a forthcoming game with Louisiana State University (LSU). Cosgrove — a center who handled the ball on each offensive play — asserted that he had been offered $1,000 for his part in the $1,500, three player scandal.\nCosgrove and his two teammates — guard Frank Navarro and star quarterback Jack Scarbath — indicated that the bribes were offered as part of a point shaving scheme in which the Maryland squad was to keep the margin of victory under 21 points. The bribe offers were rejected by all three, who alerted authorities in advance of the game. \nMaryland ultimately beat LSU by a score of 34–6, a margin of 28 points, in the October 25 game. An Associated Press news report noted of the game that \"Scarbath completed three touchdown passes in the game. Cosgrove's [snaps] from center were accurate and fast. Navarro held his guard position as usual.\"\nA fugitive wanted as a suspect in the case, Louis Leonard Glickfield of Hyattsville, Maryland, a 21-year old Maryland student, surrendered to authorities on October 29. He was convicted of the crime and sentenced to 18 months in the Maryland state reformatory and fined $1,000.\nProfessional career.\nCosgrove was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the sixth round (156th overall) of the 1952 NFL Draft.\nHis contract was traded to the expansion Baltimore Colts. In July 1953 he reported to the team's first training camp at Western Maryland College in Westminster, Maryland. Cosgrove got playing time during the team's preseason schedule but was waived from the Colts in the final cut to the league limit of 33 players on September 23.\nCosgrove's situation is mentioned in the memoir of Colts lineman Art Donovan, who contends there was pressure on head coach Weeb Ewbank to keep Cosgrove on the Baltimore roster due to his roots at the neighboring University of Maryland despite Ewbank's desire to release him. \"He was supposed to be an All-American but he really wasn't too good,\" Donovan recalled, \"He was okay, not the best — he just had two great centers in front of him...\" In an exhibition game against Pittsburgh, Cosgrove suffered an ankle injury, Donovan contends, but instead of sitting him as the injury required, Ewbank intentionally inserted Cosgrove into a game so that he would look slow and incapable on film, thereby eliminating any potential front office objection to a controversial cut.\nLife after football.\nAfter the end of his playing career Cosgrove became a commercial airline pilot. He flew for Capital Airlines and then for United Airlines after the two merged. Cosgrove retired in 1990 to Potomac, Maryland.\nCosgrove married Marguerite Wilson, with whom he had 8 children and 27 grandchildren.\nDeath and legacy.\nCosgrove died March 27, 2017, a Potomac, Maryland. His body was interred at Arlington National Cemetery Section 30, Site 841-RH.\nIn 2005, Tom Cosgrove was inducted into the University of Maryland Athletics Hall of Fame."

        "text": "The 2009 US Open was a tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts, held from August 31 to September 14, 2009, in the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center at Flushing Meadows, New York City, United States. Originally, it was scheduled to end with the men's singles final match on Sunday, September 13, but due to rain the tournament was extended by one day. Like the Australian Open, the tournament featured night matches.\nFormer World No. 1 and 2005 US Open women's singles champion, Kim Clijsters, competed in the 2009 US Open after being granted a wild card entry, returning to professional tennis after more than two years of retirement. She made it to the women's singles semi-finals, where she knocked out the defending champion Serena Williams in controversial circumstances. In the final, Clijsters defeated Caroline Wozniacki, the first Dane, man or woman, to reach a Grand Slam final in the Open Era, in straight sets: 7–5, 6–3. Clijsters thus became the first mother to win a Grand Slam since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980. In the process, she also became the first unseeded player and wildcard to win the tournament.\nIn the men's singles final, five-time defending champion Roger Federer lost to Argentina's Juan Martín del Potro in a match lasting over four hours.\nArthur Ashe Kids' Day.\nThe Arthur Ashe Kids' Day was held on August 29, 2009, prior to the start of the tournament. It featured an exhibition tennis match involving American player Andy Roddick and Great Britain's Andy Murray, who were joined by actor and comedian Will Ferrell. \"American Idol\" winner Jordin Sparks performed her hit single \"Battlefield\", along with rising stars Honor Society and Justin Bieber. There were also tennis matches and contests featuring Serena Williams, Ana Ivanovic Andy Roddick, Roger Federer, Maria Sharapova, Kim Clijsters, and James Blake. The popular tennis and music festival, which included interactive games, musical entertainment and tennis clinics, was hosted by television personalities Susie Castillo and Quddus.\nDay-by-day summaries.\nDay 1 (August 31).\nThe first day of the tournaments saw many seeds get through pretty easily in straight sets: Roger Federer, James Blake, Lleyton Hewitt, Nikolay Davydenko and Radek Štěpánek. The day also produced a couple of upsets, when Mikhail Youzhny continued 26th seeded Paul-Henri Mathieu's horrible US Open record by beating him in four. While, tall American John Isner did the same to 28th seeded Victor Hănescu by ending the Romanian's 2009 bid in three with the second set going to a tie-break 16–14. The exciting day continued with a couple of five-set marathons, with Simon Greul defeating Giovanni Lapentti, Guillermo García López out-lasting Peter Polansky, and Jan Hernych surviving against Rainer Schüttler. The days last match featured America's hope Andy Roddick prevailing over Björn Phau in straight sets in a match that started at 11:00 pm.\nOn the women's side, former world no. 1 Kim Clijsters opened the play, winning over Viktoriya Kutuzova losing only two games. Joining her were defending 2009 Wimbledon and Australian Open champion Serena Williams, Amélie Mauresmo, Victoria Azarenka, Flavia Pennetta, Elena Vesnina, Agnieszka Radwańska, Li Na and Marion Bartoli who all won in two sets.

With Venus and Serena getting past the first round, a few American players saw success on the women's side with Vania King, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, and Jill Craybas getting to the second round.

No. 30 seed Victor Troicki survived a five-set scare, 6–3, 6–3, 1–6, 2–6, 6–1.

He produced 33 winners and only 10 unforced errors in the last match of the night.\nThe women's side received a lot of buzz, with 17-year-old American Melanie Oudin upsetting hot favorite and US Open Series champion Elena Dementieva in the second round. Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan upset last year's runner-up Jelena Janković in three sets. Seeded players who joined Dementieva and Janković were Alona Bondarenko, who lost to Gisela Dulko, and Patty Schnyder, who lost in straight sets, while Sabine Lisicki lost in three to the last Australian and qualifier on the draw Anastasia Rodionova. No. 1 seed Dinara Safina once again survived a scare from Kristina Barrois, winning 6(5)–7, 6–2, 6–3. However, a few seeded players got through quite easily, led by Russians Svetlana Kuznetsova, Maria Sharapova, Nadia Petrova, and Danish player Caroline Wozniacki. Unseeded players who got through in straight sets were Kateryna Bondarenko, who eliminated Ivanovic, Shahar Pe'er, Sara Errani, and Petra Kvitová.\nOn the doubles side, it was the opposite, with all of the women's doubles seeds getting through.

No. 24 seed Juan Carlos Ferrero and no. 16 seed Marin Čilić both survived their matches, despite losing the first two sets. Many victors were pushed to five sets: Nicolás Almagro, a returning Taylor Dent, and Denis Istomin. Although many seeds struggled, French seeds got through easily with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gaël Monfils, and Gilles Simon winning their matches on straight sets. They were joined by Argentine Juan Martín del Potro, who also won in straight sets.\nOn the women's side, Victoria Azarenka lost to Italian Francesca Schiavone in three sets after Azarenka double-faulted on a match point. The rest of the matches were all won in straight sets, led by Serena Williams, who defeated María José Martínez Sánchez, who had a controversial match at the 2009 French Open. She was joined by Daniela Hantuchová, who crushed American Vania King, Li Na, Kim Clijsters, Flavia Pennetta, and Venus Williams. Elena Vesnina lost to 7th seed Vera Zvonareva.\nOn the women's side, seventh seeded Hsieh Su-wei and Peng Shuai were ousted by the American team of Alexa Glatch and Carly Gullickson.

        "title": "Team classification in the Tour de France",
        "text": "The team classification is a prize given in the Tour de France to the best team in the race. It has been awarded since 1930, and the calculation has changed throughout the years. There is no colored jersey for this, but the numbers on the jerseys of the members of the team with the best performance in the general classification at the end of the previous stage are against a yellow background instead of white.\nHistory.\nIn the early years of the Tour de France, cyclists entered as individuals. Although they had sponsors, they were not allowed to work as a team, because tour organiser Henri Desgrange wanted the Tour de France to be a display of individual strength. In those years, cyclists could also participate unsponsored. They were categorized under different names; 1909-1914: Isolés; 1919: Categorie B; 1920-1922: 2° Classe; 1923-1926: Touristes-Routiers; 1937: Individuels.\nIn 1930, Henri Desgrange gave up the idea that cyclist should race individually, and changed the format to real teams. He was still against sponsors assistance, so the cyclists were grouped in countries. This was the situation in the Tours of 1930–1961 and 1967–1968. Between 1962 and 1966 and after 1969, sponsored teams entered the race.\nAt the introduction of teams in 1930, a prize for the winning team was introduced, then called the \"Challenge international\". In 1930, the classification was calculated by adding the times of the three best cyclists in the general classification.\nIn 1961, the calculation was changed. The team classification was changed into a points system, where a team received one point for the best team-time in the stage, and the team with the most points was the winner. This system was also used in 1962, but in 1963 the calculation was reverted to the time calculation. In the 1970s, this system was reintroduced as the team points competition, although in a different way: after every stage, all cyclists received points (1 for the winner, 2 for the second, etc.) and these were added, and the team with the fewest points was the winner of the team points classification.\nBetween 1952 and 1990, the team classification leaders could be recognized by yellow caps, until helmets became mandatory. Since 2006 the best team has worn black on yellow back numbers. Beginning in 2012 the best team was awarded the right, but not the obligation, to wear yellow helmets.\nStatus.\nThe team classification is considered less important than the individual general classification, and it is rare that a team starts the Tour with the main goal of winning the team classification. If during the race a team is in a good position to win the team classification, the team may change tactics in order to win.\nWhen Lance Armstrong lost hopes of winning in 2010, he instructed his teammates to keep an eye on their main rivals for the team classification, and his Team RadioShack won the team classification.\nA good performance in the team classification may help a team to qualify for the next Tour de France. In 2010, a system was set up to determine which teams qualify as UCI ProTeams, and the team classification in the Tour de France was part of this system.\nCalculation.\nAs of 2011, the team classification is calculated by adding the times of the three best riders of each team per stage; time bonuses and penalties are ignored. In a team time trial, the team gets the time of the fifth rider of that team to cross the finish, or the last rider if there are fewer than five left for the team. If a team has fewer than three cyclists remaining, it is removed from this classification.\nWinners.\nTeam points classification.\nBetween 1973 and 1989, there was an additional team points classification."

        "text": "The 1992 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) began on April 18, after the conclusion of the 1991–92 NHL season. The Stanley Cup was won by the Pittsburgh Penguins, defeating the Chicago Blackhawks in the Finals, in four games.\nThe 1992 playoffs saw history being made, as for the first time ever, all four division winners were eliminated in the same round. In the division finals, the Norris Division champion Detroit Red Wings were swept by the Chicago Blackhawks in four straight games, and the Montreal Canadiens, who had won the Adams Division, suffered the same fate at the hands of the Boston Bruins. The Pittsburgh Penguins eliminated the Patrick Division titlists, the New York Rangers, in six games, while the Vancouver Canucks, the Smythe Division toppers, fell to the Edmonton Oilers, also in six games.\nA record 54 games were played in the first round, with six of the eight series going the full seven games, and the other two going six games (the Oilers' win over the Kings and the Blackhawks' win over the Blues). Three of the eight series featured teams coming back from 3–1 series deficits (Detroit against Minnesota, Pittsburgh against Washington, and Vancouver against Winnipeg), the most in a single playoff year; this record was equaled in 2003. Conversely, five series ended in sweeps, the most in a single playoffs since the modern format of four rounds of best-of-7 series was introduced in 1987.\nThis was the last year the Hartford Whalers and Minnesota North Stars qualified for the playoffs. The franchises would not reach the post-season again until 1999 and 1994 respectively. By the time each franchise reached the playoffs again, they were known as the Carolina Hurricanes and the Dallas Stars, respectively.\nVideo replay was used to decide a playoff game for the first time in game six of the Detroit–Minnesota division semifinal. Sergei Fedorov of the Red Wings appeared to hit the crossbar behind Minnesota goalie Jon Casey during the first overtime, but after the North Stars iced the puck immediately afterward, referee Rob Shick called for a video review, which determined that the puck had entered the goal just below the crossbar and caromed off the frame at the back of the net. Fedorov was awarded the goal, giving the Red Wings a series-tying victory.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nDivision semifinals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (A4) Hartford Whalers.\nThis was the fifth playoff series meeting between these two teams.

This was the final time that the Hartford Whalers qualified for the playoffs; the next time that this franchise made the playoffs was in 1999 as the Carolina Hurricanes. Game six was the final playoff game played at the Hartford Civic Center.\n(A2) Boston Bruins vs. (A3) Buffalo Sabres.\nThis was the fifth playoff series meeting between these two teams.

        "text": "The 2009 SummerSlam was the 22nd annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on August 23, 2009, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California and was the first of six consecutive SummerSlam events to take place at the arena. It was the last SummerSlam to include the ECW brand.\nEight matches were contested on the event's card. The main events of the evening included CM Punk defeating Jeff Hardy in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to win the World Heavyweight Championship for a third time, Randy Orton retaining the WWE Championship against John Cena after the match was restarted multiple times, Christian retaining the ECW Championship against William Regal, and D-Generation X's Triple H and Shawn Michaels defeating The Legacy's Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase Jr. Also on the show, WWE Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio Jr. defeated Dolph Ziggler and Chris Jericho and The Big Show defended the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship against Cryme Tyme. The event received 369,000 buys, down from the SummerSlam 2008 figure of 477,000 buys.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2009 event was the 22nd event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on August 23, 2009, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands.\nTickets for SummerSlam went on sale starting February 13, 2009. The first teaser trailer for the event was shown at WWE's Extreme Rules event. The trailer included the event's official theme song, \"You Gotta Move\" by Aerosmith. As part of the promotion for the event, WWE held \"SummerSlam Axxess\", a fan convention similar to WrestleMania's fan convention, \"WrestleMania Axxess\", at Nokia Plaza in L.A. Live from August 22 to August 23. According to video game publisher THQ, further details of the latest installment of their \"WWE SmackDown\" series, \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010\", would also be revealed at the event.\nStorylines.\nThe professional wrestling matches at SummerSlam included professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events predetermined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", and \"ECW\" with the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs.\nOn the July 27 episode of \"Raw\", the show's guest host and storyline matchmaker, Shaquille O'Neal, revealed that Randy Orton would defend the WWE Championship against the winner of a \"Beat the Clock challenge\", which was determined by who of the five competitors could defeat their opponent in the fastest time: Mark Henry, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), Triple H, Jack Swagger, or John Cena. Henry set the pace by defeating Carlito in 6:49, while MVP, Triple H, and Swagger failed to defeat their opponents. Cena beat Henry's time by defeating The Miz, and become Orton's opponent at SummerSlam.\nThe main rivalry from the SmackDown brand heading into SummerSlam was between Jeff Hardy and CM Punk in their continuing conflict over the World Heavyweight Championship. Animosity stemmed from Extreme Rules when Punk invoked the guaranteed title match he earned by winning the Money in the Bank ladder match against Hardy and defeated him for the World Heavyweight title. The two faced off at the next two pay-per-view events, The Bash and Night of Champions, with Hardy winning the latter match to regain the title. This also saw a number of conflicts between the two over their respective philosophies in life; Punk is legitimately straight edge, which promotes a drug-free lifestyle, while Hardy, who has had a number of indiscretions with drugs throughout his career, was at odds with the way Punk reprimanded the fans for their potential addictions. Following two assaults on Hardy, SmackDown General Manager, Theodore Long, scheduled a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match between the two for SummerSlam.\nThe ECW brand was represented at the show with Christian defending the ECW Championship against William Regal. On the August 11 episode of the program, Christian was a guest on the talk show segment, The Abraham Washington Show, during which Regal was revealed the number one contender.\nOn the July 27 episode of \"Raw\", the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho and The Big Show got into a heated confrontation with Shaquille O'Neal. After the two refused to get into a fight with him, O'Neal scheduled the champions to fight Cryme Tyme in a tag team match later that night with O'Neal acting as the match's ringside enforcer; the champions were disqualified, making their opponents angry. On the July 31 episode of \"SmackDown\", Cryme Tyme defeated The Hart Dynasty (Tyson Kidd and David Hart Smith) to become Jericho and Big Show's opponents for SummerSlam.\nWWE Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio Jr. had been the target of Dolph Ziggler since July. The two met at Night of Champions, only to see Mysterio retain the title. Ziggler regained his contender status on the August 7 episode of \"SmackDown\" by defeating R-Truth, Mike Knox, and Finlay in a fatal four-way.\nStemming from his previous rivalry with Randy Orton, Triple H started to target Orton's Legacy associates, Ted DiBiase Jr. and Cody Rhodes. Triple H failed to win a Beat the Clock challenge to face Orton in a match with Rhodes when DiBiase distracted him for sufficient time. After losing a handicap match against the two the following week, Triple H stated that he was going to get a partner, hinting throughout the show that he intended to reform D-Generation X with Shawn Michaels. A week later, it was revealed that Triple H had convinced Michaels, who was working as a chef at a corporate cafeteria, to quit his job and return at SummerSlam to face DiBiase and Rhodes in a tag team match.\nAt The Bash, The Great Khali was assaulted with a steel chair by Kane in his match with Dolph Ziggler. The following weeks saw both men interfere in each other's matches with Kane running away from his adversary any time Khali made his way to gain a measure of revenge. On the August 7 episode of \"SmackDown\", Kane attacked Khali from behind before kidnapping Khali's translator, Ranjin Singh. The following week, it was revealed that Kane was holding Singh hostage in a backstage room at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Alberta, interrogating and abusing him, before Khali found him, leading to Kane beating down on Khali. The following week, a match between the two was scheduled for SummerSlam.\nAfter Jack Swagger was moved to the Raw brand, he had a verbal confrontation with Montel Vontavious Porter, which led to MVP challenging the former to a fight, which was declined by Swagger on the grounds of his unwillingness to \"fight criminals\", referring to MVP's previous incarceration. The coming weeks saw Swagger and MVP interfere in each other's business before MVP challenged Swagger on the August 17 episode of \"Raw\". After Swagger got himself disqualified, another match was scheduled for SummerSlam.\nEvent.\nDark match.\nPrior to SummerSlam airing live on pay-per-view, the company's female wrestlers, known as divas, fought in a battle royal, with Chavo Guerrero Jr. as the guest referee. Beth Phoenix won the match by simultaneously eliminating Eve Torres and Kelly Kelly with Guerrero's help.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe show began airing with Rey Mysterio defending the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Dolph Ziggler. The match was contested at a fast pace, with Mysterio gaining executing a moonsault before the match descended out of the ring, where Mysterio executed a hurricanrana. As the match returned to the ring, Mysterio attempted an aerial attack, but Ziggler countered with a turnbuckle powerbomb. Mysterio attempted a 619, but Ziggler countered with a leg drop bulldog. As the match continued, Mysterio executed the 619 and attempted a springboard splash, but Ziggler avoided the move. Ziggler climbed to the top rope with Mysterio and attempted an attack, but Mysterio countered with a frankensteiner to retain the title.\nNext, Jack Swagger faced MVP. Swagger applied various holds and attempted a Swagger Bomb on MVP, but MVP countered the move. MVP executed a big boot on Swagger, who was cornered, and the Playmaker for the win.\nJeriShow (Chris Jericho and The Big Show) defended the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship against Cryme Tyme (JTG and Shad Gaspard). After JTG gained advantage over Jericho, Jericho tagged in Big Show, dominating JTG. JTG tagged in Gaspard, who was speared by The Big Show. Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho on JTG, who tried to reach the ropes, but Big Show executed a KO Punch on him, allowing Jericho to pin JTG to retain the titles.\nNext, Kane faced The Great Khali. The two fought until Kane pursued Ranjin Singh. Kane performed a dropkick to Khali's knee and executed a running DDT for the victory.\nMain event matches.\nD-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) faced The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted Dibiase) in Michaels' first match since WrestleMania 25. The match started with Triple H fighting DiBiase and Rhodes. When Michaels tagged in, Rhodes left the ring to avoid Sweet Chin Music. After Legacy gained the advantage, Rhodes attempted a diving elbow drop, but Michaels countered the move. Michaels attempted a diving elbow drop, but Rhodes countered and executed Cross Rhodes on Michaels. Triple H broke up the pin and executed the Pedigree on Rhodes, leading to DiBiase executing Dream Street on Triple H. As DiBiase and Triple H fought outside the ring, Michaels executed Sweet Chin Music on Rhodes to win the match.\nNext, Christian defended the ECW Championship against William Regal, accompanied by Ezekiel Jackson and Vladimir Kozlov. As Regal was removing his coat, Christian executed the Killswitch to retain the title. After the match, Jackson and Kozlov attacked Christian, with Jackson executing The Book of Ezekiel and Kozlov executing the Iron Curtain on Christian and Regal applied the Regal Stretch on Christian.\nRandy Orton defended the WWE Championship against John Cena. The match started with neither man gaining the advantage until Orton executed an elevated DDT on Cena. As Orton attempted a punt, Cena fought back. Cena attempted an Attitude Adjustment, but Orton countered and was disqualified for shoving the referee. Vince McMahon restarted the match with the stipulation that if Orton was disqualified, he would lose the title. As the match progressed, Orton intentionally got himself counted out but McMahon restarted the match again this time if Orton got Counted out or disqualified, he will lose the title. Orton pinned Cena using the ropes for leverage, but a second referee ran down to the ring and convinced the original referee to restart the match. Cena applied the STF, but a person from the crowd (later revealed as Brett DiBiase) assaulted the referee. After the person was removed from the ring, Orton executed an RKO to retain the title.\nThe main event was the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the World Heavyweight Championship between Jeff Hardy and CM Punk. Punk tried to climb a ladder, but Hardy stopped him. Hardy set up a chair in front of Punk and attempted a leg lariat, but Punk countered and dropped Hardy onto the chair. Punk executed a suicide dive on Hardy and Punk then attempted another chair shot on Hardy but Hardy countered. Punk tried to run Hardy into the steel steps but Hardy reversed Punk, which Punk jumped on the top step to avoid collision and tried to jump onto Hardy, but Hardy hit Punk with a chair while Punk was in mid-air. Hardy placed Punk on a table and dove off the top rope but Punk avoided Hardy, knocking Hardy through the table. Punk tried to climb a ladder but Hardy stopped him with a sunset flip powerbomb. Hardy tried to climb the ladder, but Punk stopped him. Punk executed a superplex onto a ladder on Hardy. Punk attempted a GTS, but Hardy countered and threw Punk through a table. Hardy tried to climb the ladder but Punk leapt off the top rope and stopped him. Hardy executed a Swanton Bomb off a ladder on Punk through a broadcast table. Back in the ring, Punk and Hardy climbed the ladder and fought until Punk knocked Hardy off the ladder and retrieved the title belt to win the match. As he was celebrating, the lights briefly went out and The Undertaker appeared, performing a chokeslam on Punk as the event ended.\nReception.\nSummerSlam 2009 was well received. The opening match between Rey Mysterio and Dolph Ziggler was praised, with James Caldwell of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" declaring it \"awesome\" and Dave Meltzer calling it a \"really strong\" match. The match between DX and The Legacy also received praise with Caldwell describing it as \"WWE's best tag team match of the year\". The main event TLC match between Punk and Hardy was universally praised. Caldwell concluded that the \"drama was great, Punk was great, Hardy was great\", and rated the match as 4 and a quarter stars, while Meltzer praised it as a \"great match\" and touted the moment when Hardy performed the Swanton Bomb on Punk from the top of the ladder as \"spectacular\". John Canton of \"TJR Wrestling\" gave positive response to the event giving particular praise to the tag team match between DX and The Legacy and the TLC match between Punk and Hardy, the latter of which he rated 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it \"outstanding\". He named the event the best WWE pay-per-view of 2009.\nAll the writers criticized the WWE Championship match, however, with Caldwell saying that \"WWE over-booked the crap out of this match\". The shortness of the ECW Championship match was also criticized, with Caldwell remarking that it was \"another ridiculous ECW Title match on WWE PPV\". Aldren queried the decision to make it so short, saying that Christian and Regal \"could have had one of the best matches on the show\", a sentiment echoed by Meltzer. Meltzer also criticized the match between Khali and Kane, with Aldren remarking that the crowd \"was dead\" and Meltzer calling it \"pretty bad\". Caldwell said that it was a \"bad match with a decent finish\", as the match \"lowered the bar\" early enough that the \"finish was intriguing\".\nThe event received 369,000 buys, which was a decrease from the SummerSlam 2008, the previous year's event, which received a figure of 477,000 buys.\nAftermath.\nOn the following \"Raw\", Vince McMahon gave John Cena one more chance to challenge Randy Orton for the WWE Championship at WWE Breaking Point. Since Orton had tried to retain the title by getting himself disqualified or counted out, the match was made an \"I Quit\" match, which also was in line with the pay per view's submission match concept. In response to Brett DiBiase's actions, McMahon also decreed that if anyone tried to interfere in the match on Orton's behalf, Orton would be stripped of the championship automatically.\nOn the August 27 episode of \"WWE Superstars\", Dolph Ziggler, Mike Knox, and Finlay competed in a triple threat match with the winner advancing to challenge Rey Mysterio for the WWE Intercontinental Championship at Breaking Point; Ziggler won the match, making it his third consecutive month challenging for the title. The match was changed on the September 4 episode of \"SmackDown\" after John Morrison won the title from Mysterio (Mysterio was legitimately suspended for violating the company's wellness policy, forcing him to drop the title).\nOn the August 28 episode of \"SmackDown\", Punk defended the World Heavyweight Championship in a Steel Cage match with a stipulation that the loser of the match would leave the company. Punk ultimately won the match, leading to the departure of Hardy from the WWE. The Undertaker was chosen as Punk's opponent for Breaking Point.\nAfter SummerSlam, The Legacy continued their antagonizing of D-Generation X; a submissions count anywhere match between the two teams was scheduled for Breaking Point.\nThe Great Khali pursued Kane after SummerSlam, while Kane avoided him. A match with legal use of Singapore canes between the two was scheduled for Breaking Point.\nThis was the last SummerSlam to feature ECW, as well as the ECW Championship, as the brand was disbanded in February 2010, deactivating the championship with it."

The native of Zebulon, North Carolina, was listed as tall and .\nPearce's lone full season came with Washington in . He worked in 20 games, including three starting pitcher assignments, and won two of three decisions, including his first MLB complete game, a 9–3 triumph against the St. Louis Browns on August 28 at Griffith Stadium. But he posted an abysmal 6.04 earned run average over the season in 56 innings pitched, didn't get another trial with the Senators until April 1953, and would work in only eight more big-league games in his career.\nAcquired by Cincinnati after an outstanding season in the Double-A Southern Association, Pearce was highly effective in two September 1954 appearances. He held the Brooklyn Dodgers scoreless in a two-inning relief stint at Ebbets Field on September 14. Then, six days later, he was selected to start against another first-division team, the Milwaukee Braves, at County Stadium. Pearce threw a complete game, 3–1 victory, with Milwaukee's only run scoring unearned when the Redlegs made two errors in the field in the seventh inning.\nThe following April 16, Pearce tried to duplicate his success against the Braves, starting against them at Cincinnati's Crosley Field. He allowed an unearned run in the second inning, and then was driven from the mound in the third when Milwaukee strung together four straight hits, good for three runs. Pearce was charged with the 9–5 loss. He made one final appearance in the majors as a relief pitcher over two weeks later, allowing one earned run in one inning pitched against the Philadelphia Phillies. He spent the rest of his career in the minor leagues, retiring after the 1959 season.\nHis major league career consisted of 30 games pitched, a 3–4 win–loss record, with 97 hits and 53 bases on balls allowed and 22 strikeouts in 85 innings pitched. His career earned run average was 5.78."

In 1985, the Gateway took on football as its only men's sport.

        "text": "The Marshall Thundering Herd baseball team represents the Marshall University in NCAA Division I college baseball and competes in the Sun Belt Conference. The current head coach of the Herd is Greg Beals. Marshall plays its home games at Jack Cook Field, a 3,500 seat on-campus facility which opened for the 2024 season.\nHistory.\nMarshall baseball was a winning program right from the start. The Herd won the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (which Marshall helped to found in 1924 as what would be known as the WVIAC) in 1928-29-30-3 under former Ohio State University and St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Johnny \"Stud\" Stuart, then won the Buckeye Conference 1933-34-35 under Marshall and West Virginia University Halls of Fame member Roy \"Legs\" Hawley. \nIt would be until 1978 before the Herd won another league title, winning the Southern Conference in its second year in the league and again in 1981. Marshall advanced to the NCAA Tournament in 1973 as an independent and 1978 as the SoCon champ, all under legendary baseball head coach Jack Cook (the namesake of Marshall's new ballpark). Marshall finished as runner-up in the 2008 Conference USA (C-USA) baseball tournament, falling in the finals to Houston, 3–2, but winning a MU record 30 games without a home field to use in Huntington for the entire season. For the first time since 1994, MU had players drafted in the June 5–6 Major League Baseball Draft with a school-record three being selected, plus one recruit in 2008. Steve Blevins, who tied the single-season wins mark with a 9–3 mark, signed with the Minnesota Twins on June 11, while Nate Lape was drafted by the Colorado Rockies and Tommy Johnson by the Seattle Mariners. Lape and second baseman Adam Yeager played in the Cape Cod League, the premier wooden bat summer college baseball league, for the Brewster Whitecaps. In 2015, outfielder Corey Bird was an All-Cape Cod League selection, then hit .300 for the 2016 Herd and led C-USA in stolen bases. In 2016, Marshall finished second in C-USA by 1/2 game behind Florida Atlantic, and the Herd advanced to the semi-finals of the C-USA Tournament, losing to eventual champ Southern Miss in the Golden Eagles' home stadium, 3–2, in the semis and finishing 2–2 in the tourney. The Herd won a Marshall record 34 games (and lost only 21), posted the first winning season since 1994 and made the C-USA Tournament for the first time since 2010. Marshall was 13–2 in the final five series of the year in the league games and swept three in a row on the way to winning eight C-USA series, also an all-time high. Senior Chase Boster became Marshall's biggest winning when he passed both Albie DeYoung and Grant Harper with his 20th win of his career, finishing 8–3 on the season.\nUnlike most Division I baseball programs, Marshall did not have a full-time home stadium until the 2024 season. Due to Conference USA standards, it played non-conference games at Kennedy Center Field, a community baseball field just outside Huntington. Due to its limited amenities for both fans and players, Marshall has played conference games at GoMart Ballpark in Charleston, more than 50 miles from campus. Select games were also played at Linda K. Epling Stadium in Beckley, 110 miles from campus. Upgrades to the Kennedy Center Field allowed Marshall to play all its games there beginning in 2019, with the exception of games versus rivals WVU and Virginia Tech. These games drew a larger crowd than the Kennedy Center could accommodate and as such, continued to be played in Charleston through the 2023 season.\nIn 2018, the school purchased land near its existing campus for a new ballpark. Construction began in 2019, with completion originally planned for the 2021 season. The opening was delayed to the 2022 season due to COVID-19, and still later delayed until 2024. The new ballpark is named for longtime Herd head coach Jack Cook.\nNCAA Division I Tournament history.\nMarshall has appeared in the NCAA Division I baseball tournament two times. Their combined record is 2–4.\nFormer players.\nMarshall has sent 16 players to the major leagues and has had 34 Major League Baseball draft selections since the draft began in 1965."

The Knights compete in the Big 12 Conference. The Knights play their home games on UCF's main campus in Orlando, Florida at John Euliano Park.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1973–1983).\nThough UCF baseball first took the field in 1973, its history dates back to 1970 with UCF's club baseball team, the FTU Goldsox. The Goldsox played in the Amateur Baseball League of Central Florida and were managed by Jack Pantelias, who led them from 1970 to midway through the 1972 season. When Pantelias resigned, he was replaced by Doug Holmquist, who would lead the team through the end of the season on an interim basis before being named head coach before the 1973 season. Bill Moon was the head coach from 1979 to 1982. The 1979 team was UCFs first championship team – sharing the Sunshine state conference title with Florida Southern University. UCF went 27–16 that year and played in the post season regionals. The team has been nationally ranked at times during the course of 11 seasons, including the highest ranking of No. 7 during both the 2001 and 2012 seasons.\nBergman era (1983–2008).\nJay Bergman took over the program in 1983 after serving as the head coach at Seminole Community College. The Knights first season in Division I was in 1985 under Bergman. The Knights earned a 52–34–1 record in their first D–I season. Bergman was forced to retire during the 2008 season after allegations surfaced of him harassing an equipment manager.\nBergman had a large amount of success in this position, leading UCF to Atlantic Sun Championships in 93, 95, 96, 97, 00, 01, 02, 04 and NCAA Regional Appearances in 89, 93, 95, 96, 97, 00, 01, 02, 04, and brought UCF to a national ranking of No. 7 in 2001. In honor of his long-term success with the Knights, on February 3, 2001, UCF opened and dedicated Jay Bergman Field.\nRooney era (2009–2016).\nTerry Rooney became head coach in 2008 after serving as an assistant coach at LSU, Notre Dame, Stetson, Old Dominion, James Madison, and George Washington. In his second season, Rooney led the Knights to a 33–22 (10–14) record, 11 more wins than the prior season and the best conference record since the team started in Conference USA in 2006. On June 21, 2010, Rooney signed a four-year contract extension with the university, making him the Knights head baseball coach through 2014.\nFollowing a 38–21 season, Rooney led the Knights to their first NCAA tournament under his leadership in 2011. The year was a high for the Knights, defeating the No 4. ranked Florida Gators in Gainesville and the then-ranked No. 5 Gators in Orlando. The Knights also defeated the No. 6 ranked Florida State Seminoles in Tallahassee during the 2011 campaign. In 2012, Rooney led the Knights to a No. 7 ranking during week ten, and an appearance in the Coral Gables Regional.\nFrom 2013 to 2016, the Knights were 121–114 under Rooney's leadership. The Knights joined the American Athletic Conference (The American) in 2013. UCF did not appear in another NCAA tournament despite a 36–23 record in 2014 where Rooney won American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year. In 2015, the Knights were 22–7 and ranked No. 6 in the nation through their first 30 games but eventually ended the season 31–27. After going 26–33 in 2016 despite a 6–0 start, Rooney departed from UCF and eventually joined the Alabama staff as an assistant coach.\nLovelady era (2017–2023).\nOn August 22, 2016, Jay Bergman Field was renamed John Euliano Park.\nGreg Lovelady was hired as Rooney's replacement in July 2016 after serving as Head Coach at Wright State. Lovelady brought immediate success back to the UCF Baseball program, leading the Knights to a 40–22 record in 2017. The Knights were crowned American Athletic Conference Regular season Champions but went 2–2 in the conference tournament, being eliminated by East Carolina in the semifinals. The Knights received a 2 seed in the Tallahassee Regional of the NCAA tournament but were eliminated by Florida State after losing their first game to Auburn.\nStadium.\nJohn Euliano Park is located on UCF's main campus in Orlando, Florida. It was originally built in 2001 as a state-of-the-art facility, and features an indoor training facility with three batting cages and two pitching mounds. The facility was originally named after the Knights' former head coach, Jay Bergman. It retained the name until 2016, when it was named after alumnus and donor John Euliano.\nRenovations.\nWithin the last few years, John Euliano Park has been expanded from 1,980 seats to 2,230. The stadium can also accommodate another 1,000 fans on grass berms along the first and third base lines. In the next few years seating will be further expanded to a total capacity at 4,180. In addition, a new digital scoreboard and beautification has taken place as part of the renovation."

He was born at East Melbourne in 1965.\nA right arm fast-medium bowler, Sutherland made his first-class debut against Queensland at the St Kilda Cricket Ground, where one of his opponents, Scott Muller, was also debuting. He claimed Carl Rackemann as his maiden wicket and in the second innings dismissed Stuart Law for the first of his two-second innings victims. The following week the Victorians defeated New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield Final but the paceman had lost his place in the side to Paul Jackson and instead was relegated to 12th man.\nIn his three other first-class appearances he chipped in with the occasional wicket but was unable to take a big haul. He did however take some big wickets, including Justin Langer twice and against Tasmania he dismissed Ricky Ponting hit wicket. As Cricket Australia chief executive, Sutherland would later work alongside the Australian captain, as he did with Steve Waugh whom he also took the wicket of during his career, on his List A debut. He was part of Victoria's 1992/93 Mercantile Mutual Cup campaign and played in the Final which they lost to New South Wales.\nSutherland is a chartered accountant who formerly worked for Ernst &amp; Young. Following the conclusion of Sutherland's cricket career, he became a finance manager at the Carlton Football Club and was appointed as an assistant coach of Victoria in 1998/99, having become a Level III coach. Sutherland also had a stint as coach of the Melbourne University Cricket Club, where he is a life member, having played District cricket there for many years.\nSutherland joined the Australian Cricket Board, now known as Cricket Australia, as general manager in 1998. Three years later (in 2001) he replaced Malcolm Speed to become the chief executive.\nOn 6 June 2018, Sutherland announced his retirement, giving Cricket Australia 12 months notice to find a suitable replacement."

The Rams have reached six NCAA Tournaments, most recently in 2019.\nHistory.\nFounded in the late 1850s, the \"Fordham Rose Hill Baseball Club\" of St. John's College (the precursor to Fordham University, and of no connection at all to St. John's University) played against St. Francis Xavier College in the first ever college baseball game under modern nine-man-team rules (\"Knickerbocker Rules\", or \"The New York Game\") on November 3, 1859.\nThere have been 56 major leaguers who have played for Fordham, including All-Star pitcher Pete Harnisch and Baseball Hall of Famer Frankie Frisch. Frisch, a star athlete in four different sports at Fordham, was known as the \"Fordham Flash\". Steve Bellán, a Cuban who attended what was then St. John's College from 1863 to 1868, played in the major leagues, primarily as a third baseman, and was the first Latin American in professional baseball. Gil McDougald, who played for the New York Yankees, was a coach on the team. Announcer Vin Scully, who played outfield at Fordham before achieving greater fame in the broadcast booth, hit one home run in his Fordham career, which included a game against George H. W. Bush who was playing for Yale University. Fordham's most recent Hall of Fame inductee class in 2012 included a member of the baseball team, Bob Cole.\nIn honor of the 150th anniversary of the team's first game, Fordham played Williams College, which was also celebrating its sesquicentennial of baseball play. University President Joseph M. McShane, who had conceived of the anniversary game, threw out the ceremonial first pitch of the game. Williams had lost to Amherst College July 1, 1859 and considered the first college baseball game under the now defunct Massachusetts rules, losing 73-32.\nHome field.\nThe team plays home games at Jim Houlihan Park at Jack Coffey Field. Jack Coffey Field, a multisport facility, is named after Jack Coffey, former athletic director and baseball coach at the University. He amassed 817 wins as a baseball coach. Coffey is the only player to play with both Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth in the same season (1918 Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox). The baseball portion of the field was renamed \"Houlihan Park\" after renovations completed in 2005."

The Falcons have played in three NCAA Tournaments, going in , , and . The program has 12 regular-season conference championships (7 NWOIAA, 5 MAC), six East Division championships, and three conference tournament championships. The most recent regular-season championship came in 2009. The 1921 team was the first athletic team at the school to win a title, when they finished 6–1–2 in the Northwest Ohio League.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe first baseball team at Bowling Green Normal College was established in 1915 under the guide of head coach F.G. Beyerman and finished their inaugural campaign at 1–3. The program would not reach varsity level until 1918, playing their first game on May 3, 1918 defeating Defiance College 4–3 in 7 innings. The Normals would finish the 1918 season 2–1 defeating Bluffton College 6–5 and losing a rematch with Defiance 13–3.\nBowling Green joined the Northwest Ohio League in 1921 and finished the season 6–1–2, good enough to make the Normals NWOIAA champions in their first year in the conference. The 1921 Normals baseball team would be the first athletic program at Bowling Green to win a title of any sort.\nIn May 1944 the baseball team won 1–0 against the Camp Perry team, where Italian prisoners of war watched the game.\nBowling Green would win six more NWOIAA titles (1922, 1925–26, 1928, 1931–32), before deciding to leave the conference and become an independent.\nMove to the MAC.\nIn 1953, Bowling Green would become a member of the Mid-American Conference, following rival and former NWOIAA conference mate Toledo who joined in 1951. In their first season in the MAC, the Falcons would go 8–6 including a 4–4 conference record which would place them 3rd in the conference. Bowling Green would not win their first MAC crown until 1972 when they posted a 24–12–2 record (6–2–1 MAC) and were invited to the NCAA District IV Tournament. The Falcons would defeat Northern Illinois 2–0 and Central Michigan 7–5 in 10 innings, but fell just short of a birth to the College World Series as they lost 7–2 and 7–5 to Iowa.\nSince moving to the MAC, Bowling Green has won six more regular season championships (1995, 1998–99, 2001–02, 2008) and two conference tournament championships (1998–99). The Falcons were the MAC's representative in the 1999 NCAA Division I baseball tournament and were selected to compete as the 4th seed in the Columbus Regional, hosted by Ohio State. The Falcons would go 0–2, losing to 1st seed Ohio State 4–1 and then lost in the loser's bracket 10–5 to the 2nd seed Nebraska.\nDanny Schmitz era.\nDanny Schmitz replaced Ed Platzer as head coach of the Bowling Green Falcons in 1991. In Schmitz's first season as head coach, the Falcons posted a 16–39–1 (7–23) record and finished 9th in the MAC. Schmitz would turn the program around in his fourth season (1994) posting a 29–18 (16–10) record, finishing 3rd in the MAC. He would lead the Falcons to their second MAC crown the following year posting a 34–20 (22–8) record.\nUnder Schmitz' watch, the Falcons have won five regular-season conference championships, six East Division titles, two conference tournament championships, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Schmitz is second longest tenured coach in the program's history, only behind Warren E. Steller (31 seasons) and is the programs all-time winningest manager with 489 wins. Schmitz became the program's all-time winningest coach on March 26, 2000 after the Falcons defeated Buffalo 3–2.\nAfter 105 years, the sport was dropped at the varsity level effective immediately on May 15, 2020 as part of the budget cuts due to the on-going coronavirus pandemic. Just weeks later, the school announced it was reinstating baseball after they fund-raised $1.5 million dollars of commitments over the next three years. On June 3, 2020, it was announced that Schmitz would step down from head coach and step into an advisory role with the program.\nSteller Field.\nSteller Field has been home to the Falcons baseball team since 1964. The field is named in honor of Warren E. Steller, a former instructor at the school who coached the school's football (1924–34) and baseball (1925, 1928–59) teams.

        "title": "Washington Huskies baseball",
        "text": "The Washington Huskies baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball team of the University of Washington, located in Seattle, Washington, United States. The program has been a member of the NCAA Division I Pac-12 Conference since the start of the 1960 season, preceded by the Pacific Coast Conference.\nThe team has played at Husky Ballpark since 1998; the on-campus venue was renovated extensively for the start of the 2014 season. Jason Kelly has been the program's head coach since the start of the 2023 season. The program has appeared in nine NCAA tournaments. It has won two Pac-10 North-South Division playoffs, six Pac-10 North Division Titles, eight PCC North Division Titles, and two PCC Regular season Championships. As of the start of the 2014 season, 18 former Huskies have appeared in the major leagues.\nHistory.\nThe baseball program at UW began play in the 1901 season, in which it went 4–6 under head coach Fred Schlock. After not competing in 1902, the team returned in the 1903 season. From its inception through the end of the 1915 season, the team did not belong to a conference. Prior to 1923, most of the program's head coaches served only one or two seasons, with Dode Brinker being the only exception. Brinker served four tenures as the program's head coach (1906, 1909–1910, 1915–1916, 1918–1919), in between which he also played professional baseball. In his seven seasons as the team's head coach, Washington had a 59–28 record.\nPacific Coast Conference.\nUnder Brinker, the program joined the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) for the 1916 season. After not playing in 1917 due to World War II and competing as an independent in 1918, the PCC resumed baseball in 1919. Washington won that year's conference championship with a perfect 10–0 record in Brinker's final season. It won the PCC Championship again in 1922 under head coach Robert L. Mathews.\nIn 1922, the university adopted the husky as its mascot and athletic nickname. Since 1920, the teams' nickname had been the Sundodgers, and prior to that the university's athletic programs were known as both the Indians and the Vikings.\nPrior to the 1923 season, Tubby Graves became the program's head coach; the Huskies won seven PCC North Division titles, all in Graves' first ten seasons. In 1932, the Huskies won the North Division title with a 13–4 conference record, the division title was the team's last under Graves, who coached through the end of the 1946 season. In the 1930s, the team's home venue was named Graves Field in honor of Graves, and the name carried over to the next venue used by Washington from the late-1960s until the end of the 1997 season.\nAfter finishing no higher than second in the PCC North Division from 1932 to 1951, the team tied for the division title in 1951. In the 1959 season, the Huskies won the North Division title outright under coach Dale Parker. In doing so, the program qualified for its first NCAA tournament. It finished second in the District VIII Regionals with a 1–2 record.\nPac-12 Conference.\nOn July 1, 1959, the PCC dissolved following a scandal involving illegal payments to football players at several of the conference's schools. In reaction, five former PCC members, including Washington, formed the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU), which began play in the 1959–1960 school year. With the addition of several other schools, the conference eventually became known as the Pac-12 Conference.\nWashington struggled in its first two decades after beginning play in the AAWU in the 1960 season. It did not have a winning conference record in its first 19 seasons in the AAWU (renamed the Pacific-8 Conference following the 1968 season). The stretch included five consecutive last-place finishes from 1967 to 1971 under head coach Ken Lehman. The program had its first winning conference record in the 1979 season, when it finished in second place in the North Division of the Pacific-10 Conference, which had been renamed prior to that season.\nIn 1981, head coach Bob MacDonald, who had held the position since prior to the 1977 season, led the team to its first division title since 1959. MacDonald was also the head coach in 1985, when the team qualified for its first Pac-10 North Division Tournament. The Huskies qualified for the tournament in each of the next five seasons, finishing as the tournament runner-up in 1987 and 1990. In 1992, MacDonald's final season, the Huskies qualified for their second NCAA tournament with a 39–21 record and North Division title. The team was seeded sixth in the six-team West Regional. After defeating first-seeded Arizona and fourth-seeded Fresno State in its opening two games, the team lost consecutive games to Pepperdine and Hawaii and was eliminated.\nFollowing the 1992 season, MacDonald left Washington to become the head coach at Navy and was succeeded by Husky assistant coach Ken Knutson. In 1993, Knutson's first season, the team won the Pac-10 North and had a 39-19 overall record but did not receive an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. In 1994, the team did qualify for the NCAA tournament and played in the Midwest II Regional. The Huskies lost to Georgia Tech in the regional finals. The program continued to have success in the 1990s, winning the Pac-10 North Division title in 1996, 1997, and 1998. It qualified for the 1997 and 1998 NCAA tournaments after winning the Pac-10 North-South Division Playoff in each season. Individually, Chris Magruder, who later played Major League Baseball, was named a Second Team All-American by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association in 1998.\nPrior to the 1998 season, the program opened Husky Ballpark, a newly built on-campus home venue that replaced Graves Field. In Washington's first game at the new facility, the Huskies lost to Gonzaga 4–3.\nIn the three seasons from 1999 to 2001, the program finished with a conference winning percentage of .500 or worse and did not qualify for the NCAA tournament. From 2002 to 2004, however, the team qualified for three consecutive NCAA tournaments. Its most successful tournament came in 2004, when the Huskies qualified as the second-seeded team in the Oxford Regional. After losing its opening game to Tulane, the team defeated Ole Miss and Western Kentucky in consecutive elimination games before being eliminated by Tulane in the Regional Finals. Future Major League Baseball players on the 2004 team included Tim Lincecum and Brent Lillibridge. Lincecum was named that season's co-National Freshman of the Year by \"Collegiate Baseball\".\nFollowing the 2009 season, head coach Knutson was fired after four consecutive losing seasons in the Pac-10. He was replaced by Indiana State head coach Lindsay Meggs, who played college ball at UCLA. In Meggs' first four seasons, the Huskies' highest win total was 30 (in 2012), and their highest Pac-12 finish was a tie for 6th (in 2013). In 2014, the program reached its first NCAA tournament in a decade, going 41–17 and finishing second in the Pac-12. At the Oxford Regional, Washington went 2–2, defeating three-seed Georgia Tech twice and losing to host Ole Miss twice, both games by one run. The Huskies' 2014 success coincided with extensive, $15 million renovations to Husky Ballpark.\nVenues.\nOld Graves Field.\nAlthough a 1931 source refers to the team's home venue simply as the \"Husky ball lot,\" sources as early as 1936 refer to the program's home venue as Graves Field, named for Tubby Graves, the program's head coach from 1923 to 1946. The field was located directly north of Hec Ed Pavilion and east of the current Graves Hall. Oriented northeast, the infield was at the western end of the current outdoor tennis courts; its concrete grandstand continues as the Bill Quillian tennis stadium. Left and center field were displaced by the Intramural Activities Building. In addition to Washington baseball, the field hosted freshman football games and the Whitworth College (NAIA) baseball team for periods of its history.\nGraves Field.\nWith the construction of the Intramural Activities Building in the late 1960s, a new baseball field was built at the northeast corner of the UW campus. Also oriented northeast with natural grass, its center field fence was near the intersection of NE 45th Street and Union Bay Place (now Mary Gates Memorial Avenue). Originally a practice field to the new main field adjacent to the west, it became the program's venue shortly after its construction and was also named after Graves. In 1973, it underwent $19,000 renovations. It had a seating capacity of 1,500 spectators in temporary seating. Used by the program until the end of the 1997 season, it is now occupied by intramural athletic fields.\nHusky Ballpark.\nDuring the 1990s, plans for a new stadium to replace Graves Field were announced. Ground was broken in 1997 and the $4.75 million Husky Ballpark hosted its first regular season game in late February 1998. Oriented southeast, it is located north of Husky Stadium and northeast of the site of Old Graves Field. It featured an AstroTurf infield, changed to FieldTurf in 2005, with a well-draining natural grass outfield. It had a seating capacity of 2,212 and employed only temporary bleachers for its first 16 seasons, through May 2013.\nRenovation.\nPlans were announced in 2011 for a $15 million building project on a new Husky Ballpark. The new stadium, over a decade overdue, was completed the start of the 2014 season; the new concrete grandstand will have a capacity of 2,500 spectators. In addition to chairbacked seating behind home plate, it features berm seating past the left field fence. The grass outfield has been removed and the entire field is FieldTurf, with only the pitcher's mound as dirt.\nAlternate venues.\nSick's Stadium.\nWhile Graves Field was renovated during the 1973 season, the Huskies used Sick's Stadium as its home field. The stadium opened in 1938 and was a major league venue for one season, the home field of the Seattle Pilots in 1969.\nWithout a baseball tenant after 1976, it was salvaged in the late 1970s and demolished in 1979.\nKingdome.\nThe Huskies played early season tournaments and occasional home games in the Kingdome, which was demolished in March 2000.\nSafeco Field.\nSince the 2007 season, the program has played a single conference game per season at Safeco Field, home of the Seattle Mariners.\nHead coaches.\nThe program's most successful head coach is Ken Knutson, who coached the team from 1993 to 2009 and had 584 wins. Its longest tenured head coach is Tubby Graves, who coached for 24 seasons (1923–1946).\nYearly records.\nBelow is a table of the program's yearly records.\nNotable former players.\nThe following is a list of notable former Huskies and the seasons in which they played for the program.\nRetired numbers.\nThe program has retired one jersey number.\nMajor League Baseball Draft.\n2012 MLB Draft.\nFour Huskies were selected in the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft: 3B Jacob Lamb by the Arizona Diamondbacks (6th round), P Aaron West by the Houston Astros (17th round), OF Chase Anselment by the Atlanta Braves (17th round), and C B.K.

        "title": "Harvard Crimson baseball",
        "text": "The Harvard Crimson baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball team of Harvard University, located in Boston, Massachusetts. The program has been a member of the Ivy League since the conference officially began sponsoring baseball at the start of the 1993 season. The team plays at Joseph J. O'Donnell Field, located across the Charles River from Harvard's main campus. Bill Decker has been the program's head coach since the 2013 season.\nThe program has appeared in four College World Series and 14 NCAA tournaments. It has won five Ivy League Championship Series, eight Rolfe Division titles, 15 EIBL regular season titles, and 12 Ivy League regular season titles. In 2019, the team won its first Ivy League title since 2005 when they defeated Columbia in the Ivy League Playoff Series.\nAs of the start of the 2014 Major League Baseball season, 12 former Crimson players have appeared in Major League Baseball.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nHarvard College's first season of baseball came in 1865; the team went 6–0 that year. It played one intercollegiate game (against Williams) and five against semi-professional teams. Organized baseball at the college had begun a few years earlier, when \"class nines\" (the teams of each of Harvard College's four class years) were first fielded; the first of these was the '66 Baseball Club, formed in 1862 by members of that year's freshman class. Despite these early years of competition, 1865 was the school's first varsity intercollegiate season.\nAlong with rowing, baseball was popular at Harvard in the late 19th century. A newspaper review of the 1871 book \"Four Years at Yale\" says that the book includes \"interesting accounts of the sports common in colleges, especially baseball and rowing, and the principal matches which have taken place between Harvard and Yale.\" An 1884 edition of the \"Washington Bee\" reprinted a \"Lowell Courier\" humor section piece that reads, \"Sixty Harvard freshman have dropped their Latin, eighty their Greek and 100 their mathematics. None of them have dropped their baseball or their boating, however, and college culture is still safe.\"\nIn a game against a semi-professional team from Lynn on April 12, 1877, Harvard catcher Jim Tyng became the first baseball player to use a catcher's mask. The mask was invented by another student, Frederick Thayer, and manufactured by a Cambridge tinsmith. Tyng later became the first Harvard player to appear in Major League Baseball when he played in a September 23, 1879, game for the Boston Red Caps.\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, Harvard was a member of two loosely organized forerunners of the Ivy League. The Intercollegiate Base Ball Association, which it played in from 1879 to 1886, included Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth, Brown, and Amherst. The College Baseball League, which it played in from 1887 to 1889, featured Yale, Princeton, and Columbia.\nThe school continued to field a varsity baseball team through the end of the 19th century. It played both fall and spring regular season games in its early years, but moved to a spring-only schedule after the 1885–1886 season. The program's highest 19th-century win total was 34, a mark it reached in both 1870 (34–9–1) and 1892 (34–5). Through the end of the 1899 season, the program played without a head coach and was instead led by its captains.\nTwo important changes to the program occurred near the end of the 19th century– at the start of the 1898 season, Harvard began playing home games at Soldier's Field, and at the start of the 1900 season, it hired E. H. Nichols as its first head coach.\nPre-World War II.\nThe program went .500 or better in 15 of the 17 seasons from 1900 to 1916. Its highest win total in that stretch, 23, came in 1915 under head coach Percy Haughton. Two head coaches served four-season tenures during the time period. L. P. Pieper coached from 1907 to 1910; the program's two losing records in this time period came under him. Frank Sexton also coached for four seasons (1911–1914); the program had a winning record in each.\nIn the early 20th century, Harvard held tryouts, usually in the spring, to select the members of the team from the student body. To start the regular season, the team often traveled to the Southern United States to play games in warm weather, a practice that began in 1898. Up until the start of World War I, its scheduled included professional and semi-professional teams, in addition to collegiate teams.\nHall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, then a member of the Boston Americans, served as the team's pitching coach for a brief time in 1902. Another future Hall of Famer, Willie Keeler of the Brooklyn Superbas, served alongside Young as the team's hitting coach.\nWilliam Clarence Matthews was Harvard's shortstop from 1902 to 1905. Matthews was black. A handful of black students graduated from Harvard around that time (its first black graduate, Richard Theodore Greener, was a member of the class of 1870), but Matthews one of only a few black players in major college athletics during an era in which baseball was divided by the color line. Harvard went 75–18 during Matthews's career. As a freshman, he scored the winning run in Harvard's 6–5 win in the decisive game of the Yale series; he also led the team in batting average as a sophomore, junior, and senior. Matthews faced racial discrimination while a member of the team. During his freshman season, he was held out of games against Navy and Virginia due to their objections to Harvard's fielding a black player. In 1903, the following year, Harvard canceled its annual southern trip when it faced similar objections. After Harvard, Matthews played one season of professional baseball and went on to a career in law. The trophy given to the Ivy League's baseball champion is named for Matthews. He was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014.\nThe 1917 season was canceled because of World War I, but the program resumed play in 1918. Through the 1932 season, the program competed as an independent school. For the 1933 season, however, Harvard joined the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League (EIBL), which had been formed by several Ivy League schools for the start of the 1930 season.\nPrior to the start of the 1929 season, Fred Mitchell was hired for his third stint as Harvard head baseball coach (he also led the program during the 1916 and 1926 seasons). Mitchell's third stint lasted from 1929 to 1938– Harvard's final four seasons as an independent and first six in the EIBL. Under Mitchell, Harvard won its first EIBL title; with an 8–4 league record in 1936, it tied Dartmouth for the championship. Mitchell resigned following the 1938 season and was replaced by Floyd Stahl. In Stahl's first season, Harvard won its second EIBL title, finishing with a 9–3 league record.\nBecause of World War II, Harvard competed as an independent in 1943 and 1946 and did not sponsor a team in 1944 or 1945.\nPost-World War II.\nEIBL.\nHarvard rejoined the EIBL for the 1947 season. For the 1948 season, Brown joined the seven other Ivy League schools in the league; Army and Navy also joined, giving the league 10 members. In the immediate postwar years, under head coaches Adolph Samborski (1947–1948) and Stuffy McInnis (1949–1954), the program finished no higher than 4th in the EIBL.\nNorman Shepard became the program's head coach for the start of the 1955 season. Under Shepard, Harvard won four EIBL titles (1955, 1958, 1964, 1968), going undefeated in league play in 1958 and 1964. In 1968, Shepard's final season, the team qualified for its first NCAA tournament. In order for Harvard to play in the tournament, Shepard threatened to speed up his retirement if the NCAA did not reschedule the District 1 Regional to avoid a conflict with Harvard's final exams. His threat succeeded, and Harvard won the rescheduled District 1 Regional, defeating Boston University once and Connecticut twice to advance to the College World Series. There, it lost its opening game to St. John's, 2–0, and an elimination game to Southern Illinois, 2–1.\nLoyal Park was hired as head coach prior to the start of the 1969 season. After finishing tied for 5th and tied for 2nd in the EIBL in his first two seasons, the program had its most successful four-year stretch from 1971 to 1974. Harvard won four consecutive EIBL titles and played in three College World Series. In 1971, Harvard won the EIBL outright and swept Massachusetts in a best-of-three District 1 Regional. In the College World Series, Harvard defeated BYU, 4–1, in its opening game, but was eliminated by consecutive one-run losses to Tulsa and Texas–Pan American. In 1972, Harvard tied Cornell for the EIBL title, but won a playoff to advance to that year's NCAA tournament. There, it advanced to the District 1 Regional finals, but lost to Connecticut, 11–2. In 1973, the program won the EIBL outright and went undefeated in the District 1 Regional to advance to the College World Series. There, it lost consecutive games to Southern California and Georgia Southern. In 1974, Harvard defeated Princeton in an EIBL tiebreaker playoff and won the District 1 Regional, but lost consecutive games to Miami and Northern Colorado at the 1974 College World Series. Park coached through the end of the 1978 season, in which Harvard won the EIBL and played in the NCAA tournament.\nAlex Nahigian replaced Park and was the program's head coach from 1979 to 1990. Nahigian had been the head coach at Providence from 1960 to 1978. Under Nahigian, Harvard appeared in three NCAA tournaments (1980, 1983, 1984). In both 1980 and 1983, it advanced to the Northeast Regional final, but lost there to St. John's in 1980 and Maine in 1983. During Nahigian's 12-year tenure, Harvard's overall record was 249–152–3.\nDuring the successful years under Shepard, Park, and Nahigian, many Crimson players distinguished themselves individually. The era from 1955–1990 saw 17 First-Team All-America selections and 31 Major League Baseball Draft selections. Paul del Rossi, a pitcher under Shepard from 1962 to 1964, set the EIBL/Ivy career record for wins, with 30. Future Major Leaguer Mike Stenhouse, who played for Park and Nahigian from 1977 to 1979, set single-season and career EIBL/Ivy batting average records, was twice named a First-Team All-American, and was a first-round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics in 1979. Another future Major Leaguer, Jeff Musselman, was the 1985 EIBL Pitcher of the Year.\nIvy League.\nDuring the tenure of Leigh Hogan (1991–1995), the EIBL folded, and the Ivy League began sponsoring baseball. Several northeast schools had formed the Patriot League in 1986, and the two non-Ivy members of the EIBL, Army and Navy, had joined the league in other sports– Army in 1990–1991 and Navy in 1991–1992. Both schools' baseball programs played their last seasons in the EIBL in 1992. Beginning with the 1993 season, the Ivy League sponsored baseball. Its eight teams competed in two four-team divisions: Harvard, Dartmouth, Yale, and Brown in the Rolfe Division, and Columbia, Cornell, Princeton, and Penn in the Gehrig Division. The division winners met in a best-of-three championship series to decide the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.\nHogan resigned following the 1995 season after coaching the program for its first three Ivy League seasons, and Suffolk head coach Joe Walsh was hired to replace him. Starting with Walsh, Harvard made its head baseball coaching position a full-time position.\nIn Walsh's first season, 1996, Harvard won the Rolfe Division, finishing three games ahead of second-place Yale, but was swept by Princeton in the best-of-three Ivy League Championship Series. Harvard then made three consecutive NCAA tournaments, after last having qualified in 1984. It defeated Princeton in the championship series in each season. As the sixth seed in the 1997 NCAA tournament, it placed third in the six-team, double-elimination Midwest Regional. After defeating first-seeded UCLA, 7–2, and fourth-seeded Stetson, 8–6, to open the regional, it lost consecutive games to host Oklahoma State and UCLA and was eliminated. As the fifth seed in the 1998 NCAA tournament, it again finished third in its regional. After losing its opening game to second-seeded Cal State Fullerton, it won elimination games against Nicholls State and Tulane before being eliminated by Fullerton. In the 1999 tournament, the first year of four-team regionals, Harvard lost consecutive games to Pepperdine and VCU.\nHarvard won four more Rolfe Division titles in the early 2000s, thus appearing in four Ivy League Championship Series (2002, 2003, 2005, 2006). It won the 2002 series (over Princeton) and 2005 series (over Cornell) to advance to two NCAA tournaments. It went 0–2 in both. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the program struggled, winning no Rolfe Division titles and finishing last in the division in 2008, 2011, and 2014.\nOn July 31, 2012, Walsh died of a heart attack in his Chester, New Hampshire home. He was 58 years old and had coached the program for 17 seasons, appearing in five NCAA tournaments. Beginning in 2014, the NEIBA All-Star Game was named for Walsh. In September 2012, the school hired Bill Decker to replace Walsh. Decker came from Division III Trinity (CT), where he had been the head coach for 22 seasons and won the 2008 National Championship.\nPrior to the 2013 season, several players were implicated in an academic cheating scandal and were forced to withdraw from Harvard. The 2013 team's record was 10–31 (7–13 Ivy); it finished third in the Rolfe Division.\nVenues.\nEarly venues.\nIn its first few decades, the team played at several venues around Cambridge and Boston. Besides occasionally using sites on Cambridge Common or Boston Common, the school had regular venues on campus. It spent its first two seasons (1865–1866) playing at the Delta, where Memorial Hall currently stands. From 1867 to 1883, the team's main venue was Jarvis Field, which Harvard also used for football at the time. From 1884 to 1897, the baseball team used Holmes Field, which also doubled as one of Harvard's early football venues.\nSoldier's Field / Joseph J. O'Donnell Field.\nIn 1890, Major Henry Lee Higginson donated a parcel of land on the Allston-Brighton side of the Charles River for Harvard's use. Higginson dedicated the site Soldier's Field, for six of his friends who had died fighting in the Civil War. For the start of the 1898 season, the baseball program moved to the site and shared the venue with the football and track and field teams. The venue's first game came on April 27, 1898. Harvard defeated Dartmouth, 13–7.\nOn May 4, 1997, the stadium was rededicated for Joseph J. O'Donnell, a Harvard alumnus, donor, and former baseball and football player. The venue has a capacity of 1,600 spectators.\nHead coaches.\nFrom the program's inception at the start of the 1865 season through the end of the 1899 season, the program did not have a head coach and was instead led by its captains. In the 1900 season, E. H. Nichols became the program's first head coach. Frank Sexton, who held the position from 1911–1914, was the team's first professional coach. The position became a full-time position beginning with the 1996 season, thanks to a $2.5 million endowment from program alumnus Joseph O'Donnell.\nIn the early years of the position, men commonly held it for only one season. (Prior to the 1930s, the position was held for a single season 11 times.) Since then, however, five men have coached the team for at least a decade: Fred Mitchell, Norman Shepard, Loyal Park, Alex Nahigian, and Joe Walsh. Walsh, who was the program's head coach for 17 seasons (1996–2012), served the longest tenure of any coach in program history and is also its wins leader, with 347.\nCurrent coaching staff.\nHarvard's coaching staff for the 2019 Season consisted of head coach Bill Decker and assistant coaches Bryan Stark, Brady Kirkpatrick, Kyle Decker and Morgan Brown.\nBill Decker.\nBill Decker has been the program's head coach since the start of the 2013 season. A 1984 graduate of Ithaca College, Decker's coaching career began with assistant positions at Division III schools Wesleyan (CT) and Macalester. After these, he was named the head coach at Trinity (CT) for the start of the 1991 season. Decker spent 22 seasons at Trinity, compiling a 529–231 record. He was named New England Coach of the Year and NESCAC Coach of the Year four times each. Under him, Trinity appeared in nine NCAA tournaments and won five NESCAC Tournament titles. In the 2008 season, the team nearly went undefeated, in the end finishing at 45–1 and winning the Division III National Championship.\nAssistant coaches.\nBryan Stark joined the Harvard baseball team as an assistant coach in the fall of 2014 after two seasons at Navy in the same capacity. Stark was promoted to Associate Head Coach in the summer of 2019. In 2019, Stark was a member of the staff that coached the Crimson to its first Ivy League title and NCAA appearance since 2005. Seven members of the team earned Ivy League honors, including Jake Suddelson, who was named Ivy League Player of the Year. Stark and the Harvard staff were instrumental in helping two of its players, Patrick McColl and Hunter Bigge, become MLB draft selections. In his fourth season with the Crimson, Stark accompanied a successful Harvard team to a Beanpot Championship title—its first since 2014 and fifth in program history — and its most wins since 2005 with a 22–20 overall record. Harvard tied for third in the conference with a record of 12–9, with contribution from seven All-Ivy players and four NEIBA All-New England selections. In 2018, Stark was a part of the coaching staff that helped Noah Zavolas and Simon Rosenblum-Larson become 2018 MLB Draft picks for the Seattle Mariners and Tampa Bay Rays, respectively. In addition, the team was recognized for the NCAA Academic Progress Rate Public Recognition Award, with 21 players recognized by the ECAC for academic accomplishments. In 2016, Stark helped Harvard to their most successful season since 2010, going 17–24 overall, and 9–11 in Ivy League play. Under his mentorship, John Fallon and Matt Rothenberg emerged as dangerous threats in the Harvard lineup. In his first season at Harvard, he played a key role in helping the team to an 18–24 record in the 2015 season, giving the program its most wins since 2007.\nBrady Kirkpatrick was added to the Harvard baseball staff in July 2018. Kirkpatrick will primarily work with the pitching staff and comes to Cambridge after a two-year stint at Monmouth University, with prior coaching and recruiting experience at the University of Rochester and the University of San Diego. In his first season with the Crimson, Kirkpatrick helped guide the team to its first Ivy League Championship and NCAA tournament appearance since 2005. Kirkpatrick served as the team's pitching coach, helping the team to 27 victories, the most since 2005. One of his players, Hunter Bigge, earned All-Ivy League honors after holding opponents to a .254 average and striking out 76 batters in 74.2 innings pitched. After the season, Bigge was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the 12th round of the MLB Draft. Kirkpatrick was also instrumental in helping Kieran Shaw break the Crimson saves record in 2019. Shaw totaled 13 saves, most in the Ivy League and tied for 11th in the NCAA. While at Monmouth, Kirkpatrick helped lead the Hawks to a MAAC regular season title in 2018 and coached Dan Klepchick to MAAC Rookie of the Year as well as a Collegiate Baseball News Freshman All-America recognition. Prior to his coaching career, Kirkpatrick pitched collegiately for three seasons at the University of Maryland before completing his career at the University of San Diego while obtaining his master's degree. With the Terrapins, Kirkpatrick started 11 games as a junior and held opponents to a .256 batting average, third on the team, after pitching to a 3.04 ERA as a sophomore. In total, he tossed 169 innings as a Terp, striking out 122. He was part of the 2014 South Carolina Regional championship team as well as the first Super Regional Team in Maryland history. He spent the summer of 2012 pitching for the Brewster Whitecaps in the Cape Cod Summer League, throwing to a 3.51 ERA.\nYearly records.\nThe following is a table of the program's yearly records. From its inception at the start of the 1865 season through the end of the 1899 season, the teams had no head coaches and were instead led by captains. The university did not sponsor a program in 1917, because of World War I, or from 1944–1945, because of World War II.\nNotable former players.\nThe following is a list of notable former Crimson players and the seasons in which they played for the program, where available.\nMajor League Baseball Draft.\nAs of January 2024, 61 players have been drafted to MLB from the Harvard Baseball program. Most recent articles and information are at the sources below:\nHarvard Baseball’s Chris Clark and Jay Driver Selected in 2023 Major League Baseball Draft\nThe Baseball Cube Harvard Page \nBaseball Reference Harvard Page\nRivalry with Yale.\nHistory.\nHarvard's baseball program has a long history in the school's well-known rivalry with Yale University. Overall, Harvard has a 194–178–1 record against Yale, whom they have played more than any other team.\nThe two schools' first athletic competition was a crew race in 1852– the United States' first intercollegiate athletic competition. Harvard first played Yale's baseball program on July 25, 1868. The Crimson won, 25–17, and went on to win the teams' first eight meetings. Yale won five of the next seven, including a 5–0 win in 1877 in which pitcher Charles Carter threw what later became known as a perfect game.\nThe two teams have played in nearly every season since, with a few exceptions. In 1891, Yale refused on account of Harvard's refusal to play Princeton in 1890 and 1891. The rivalry also was not played in 1917, 1944, or 1945, when Harvard did not sponsor a team due to the World Wars.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, baseball games between Harvard and Yale attracted much attention. At the end of each season, the teams played two games, one each in Cambridge and New Haven; if the teams split these games, a third was scheduled to decide that year's champion. In 1913, for example, when Yale won 2–0 in New Haven and Harvard won 4–3 in Cambridge, a third game was scheduled at Ebbets Field, the home field of Major League Baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers; Harvard won, 6–5. The games regularly drew crowds of over 10,000. The 1913 championship game at Ebbets saw an attendance mark of 15,000; a June 23, 1908, game (which Harvard lost 3–0) was attended by 14,000 spectators, including Secretary of War William Howard Taft, a Yale alumnus who had unofficially been named the Republican nominee for president only days earlier.\nThe two teams became conference rivals in the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League after Harvard joined for the 1933 season. Both teams were competitive in the league– Harvard won 21 titles, while Yale won 10. The teams finished 1–2 in the league standings five times (1937, 1947, 1955, 1980, and 1984). In 1980, the two teams met in the EIBL tiebreaker with an NCAA tournament bid at stake; Harvard swept Yale in two games, 11–3 and 6–2, to advance.\nSince the two teams began competing in the Rolfe Division in 1993, the teams have finished 1–2 in the division standings four times. In those four seasons, Yale won the division once (in 1993), while Harvard won it the other three times (1996, 1997, and 1998).\nFormat.\nThe format of the team's yearly meetings has changed frequently. From 1868–1871, the teams played only a single game. The home-and-home format popular for much of the rivalry's early history was adopted in 1872, and the tiebreaker game was played, as necessary, starting in 1877. The home-and-home format was stretched to four games during several seasons in the late-19th century, with a fifth, tie-breaking game played on multiple occasions. When Harvard joined the EIBL for the 1933 season, the tiebreaker format was scrapped. From 1935–1940, the teams instead played a regularly scheduled third game in New London, Connecticut, on the same day as the Harvard–Yale Regatta. The rivalry's schedule became irregular during the years of World War II. Following the war, formats varied until the schools began playing a regular three-game series in 1954. The rivalry consisted of three-game series from 1954–1960, two-game series from 1961–1966, and a mix of single games and doubleheaders from 1967–1980. In the last years of the EIBL (1981–1992), the two teams played one doubleheader each season, alternating home teams between seasons. Since the Ivy League began sponsoring baseball in 1993, Harvard and Yale have played a yearly four-game series, held entirely at one school, as part of Rolfe Division play.\nPopular culture.\n\"Call Me Maybe\" video.\nDuring the 2012 season, the program received attention from national media outlets for a Youtube video in which members of the team dubbed the Carly Rae Jepsen song \"Call Me Maybe.\" The video, filmed during a van ride to a road game, was viewed 2 million times in the five days after its release and led to many imitations by other sports teams. The video was choreographed and directed by senior pitcher Connor Hulse. Eight players appeared in the video: in the front row, from left to right, senior catcher Jon Smart and junior pitcher Joey Novak; in the middle row, sophomore pitcher Andrew Ferreira, senior first baseman/pitcher Marcus Way, and junior second baseman Kyle Larrow; in the back row, sophomore outfielder Jack Colton (who was asleep), senior infielder/catcher Jeff Reynolds, sophomore catcher/first baseman Steve Dill and cameraman Connor Hulse.\n\"The Little Book\".\nIn the 2008 Selden Edwards novel \"The Little Book\", protagonist Wheeler Burden plays baseball for Harvard in the early 1960s."

        "title": "Rugby union in Queensland",
        "text": "Rugby union in Queensland has traditionally been one of the most popular professional and recreational team sports in the state. Rugby union was introduced in the British colony's capital Brisbane in 1876. Initially it struggled to gain a foothold due to the popularity of Australian rules there until it got its break in 1882 with the first inter-colonial matches against New South Wales, and the formation of the Northern Rugby Union. Between 1885 and 1887 it became the dominant code after the leading schools association decided to play it exclusively and after 1890 spread virtually unopposed throughout the colony.\nThe rise of professional Rugby league in Queensland in 1908 and the Great War ultimately saw the disbandment of the Queensland Rugby Union (‘QRU’) after the 1919 season however it was later revived and continues to this day as ‘Queensland Rugby’. Despite increasing competition from three other football codes, rugby thrived in its niche nursery, with the Greater Public Schools competition and also representative football holding maximum prestige in the state. With the establishment of a permanent new home at Ballymore Stadium from the 1960s rugby experienced a golden era from the 1980s to 2000s. However it went into sharp decline in the 2010s and by 2018 was the least participated of the four major football codes in the state behind rugby league, soccer and AFL though representative matches still attract a significant audience. The Union has been reluctant to publish participation figures in recent years and has been focused on rebuilding the code.\nQueensland's most notable product is Rugby Australia Hall of Famer John Eales who was Australia’s most successful Rugby captain. All of Queensland's Hall of Famers have also captained Australia and include Tim Horan, Des Connor, Tom Lawton Snr, Mark Loane, Paul McLean, Tony Shaw and Andrew Slack.\nHistory of rugby union in Queensland.\nEarliest matches.\nRugby football commenced in Queensland in 1876, when the Brisbane FC (which had played according to the ‘Melbourne Rules' (now Australian football) since its founding in 1866), and two newly formed football clubs (Bonnet Rouge FC and Rangers FC) elected to play Rugby football. Rugby continued to be played for three seasons. In 1870 Bonnet Rouge and Rangers folded in 1878 and Brisbane FC (which had periodically played both soccer and rugby as well) returned to playing ‘Victorian rules’ (formerly ‘Melbourne rules’). As a result, rugby was rarely played in the following years.\nFred Lea, an Englishman educated at Allesley College near Rugby in Warwickshire, arrived in Brisbane in 1878 and was amazed to find that Victorian Rules in Queensland was the only football being organised. Lea took up the Victorian game, playing it in 1879-81. However, in 1880 he was able to sway two of the local clubs, Brisbane FC and Wallaroo (1878), to try rugby. Take-up of the code, however was initially very slow.\nQueensland Football Association era.\nThe Queensland Football Association was formed in April 1880 by both rugby and Victorian rules members. While vastly outnumbered by Victorian Association members rugby members lobbied the QFA to schedule matches on a Saturday every 4 weeks during the Victorian Association season, however due to insufficient numbers rugby play was infrequent in the first few seasons.\nJust two rugby matches were played in Queensland in 1880. Three matches were played between the clubs in 1881.\nBy 1882 newly formed football clubs in rural areas began to debate the adoption of either Australian or Rugby rules. Despite just a handful of rugby clubs being overwhelmed by the QFA's 50 senior Victorian association clubs, the push for representative matches saw the voice of the rugby fraternity grow extremely strong.)\nThe 1882 the QFA accepted a challenge to play intercolonial football against New South Wales. Rugby members of Brisbane FC instigated the move in contact with the Sydney Wallaroo club. The Sydney Rugby Football Union won a bidding war against the Sydney Football Association, as to which code to play under. The SRFU promised to pay full travel and accommodation costs if the Queenslanders agreed to play only rugby, whereas the SFA offered half of the gate takings if the Queenslanders agreed to play only Victorian rules. Due to the prohibitive costs of travel and expected low gate takings for Victorian rules in Sydney, the rugby offer was far more attractive.\nAs the NSWRU were keen to keep the inter-colony matches going, a NSW team journeyed to Brisbane in 1883. Trained in readiness by Fred Lea, the Queensland team ambushed the visitors and gained a victory over the New South Welshmen. The win gave rugby in Brisbane a huge boost, with many footballers wanting to try the code. Enough players aligned with the rugby body to form two clubs. Filling the void left by the folding of Bonnet Rouge and Rangers, two new clubs, Fireflies and Wanderers were formed. \nRugby members of the QFA became disgruntled with the Victorian Association's unwillingness to consider intercolonial matches. As a result of increasing pressure from the rugby fraternity to play representative matches against New South Wales, QFA clubs in 1883 voted annually as to whether to continue under the Victorian Association or adopt Rugby Union rules. \nRugby Union members were more than prepared to cover the costs of the shorter trip to Sydney. However Victorian Association officials from Melbourne showed apparent disinterest in sending teams to Queensland. After two Victorian rules tests against New South Wales Queensland rugby footballers began to bypass the QFA and directly organise rugby tests with New South Wales. This angered the QFA and a motion was passed by the QFA secretary that effectively barred players found to be playing Rugby Union from playing at a Victorian Association club, effectively segregating the two codes for the first time since its inception. The move was to backfire as it antagonised its rugby members spurring them into action.\nRugby breaks away from the QFA: Formation of the Northern Rugby Union (1883).\nWith Fred Lea (who would be later called 'The Father of Queensland rugby') actively involved, it was decided to form the Northern Rugby Football Union now named Queensland Rugby Union (QRU). On 2 November 1883 a meeting was held at the Exchange Hotel, in Brisbane and the decision was made to form a rugby association in the Colony of Queensland. The name of the newly founded union the \"Northern Rugby Union\", was used to distinguish it from the \"Southern Rugby Union\", which was the governing body of rugby in New South Wales. NRU clubs in response to the QFA, instituted the barring of rugby players from playing Victorian rules and Rugby players and officials began derogatively reverting to the term \"Melbourne Association\" and \"Melbourne Rules\" in reference to the QFA and its rules fuelling a sentiment of them being increasingly anti-rugby and anti-Queensland.\nAnother club Wasps were formed the following year in 1884 and in 1885 Wallaroo (who had been playing both codes) announced it would drop Victorian rules to reform as a rugby club.\nRugby becomes Queensland's premier football code.\nBrisbane Grammar through Richard Powell Francis had switched to rugby in 1885 and while continuing to play both codes pushed for the other Independent Schools to also. The association of Independent Schools headmasters in 1887 by 1 voted to adopt rugby exclusively feeling it would best represent Queensland's interests not to play a code with \"Victorian\" in its name. As a result, the big schools of Brisbane Grammar, Ipswich Grammar and Toowoomba Grammar, once strongholds of Australian rules, helped establish rugby throughout the colony. The top-level Rugby competition begun by those schools continues in the local Great Public Schools' Association of Queensland (GPS) system to this day.\nBetween 1885 and 1887, for the first time in the history of the colony, mainstream newspapers began to report rugby results first, followed by Victorian Association (Australian rules) and Anglo Football (soccer) and take a generally greater interest in rugby signalling the premier status of the code.\nThe decisive blow to Victorian rules came after the decision to make the NSW v Queensland matches an annual fixture, and the visit of a British rugby team in 1888. Teams from New Zealand soon followed. Unable to provide comparable attractions, Victorian rules lost its grip on Brisbane (the last matches were played in 1890) and rugby union quickly spread throughout Queensland unopposed establishing strongholds in Toowoomba, Rockhampton, Maryborough, Gympie and Charters Towers. \nQueensland Rugby Union.\nThe year 1893 saw the Northern Rugby Union formally constituted and the name changed to the Queensland Rugby Union. The first organised Brisbane club competition had begun in 1887, but by 1899 the Boer War had reduced player numbers and, to counteract this, electorate rugby was initiated which only allowed players to join the district club in the electorate in which they lived. An annual challenge trophy competition, the Hospital's Cup was introduced in 1899. This trophy is now the Premiership trophy contested by Queensland Premier Rugby clubs.\nThe first decade of the 20th century brought with it a drop in the fortunes of rugby union in Queensland. Electorate rugby collapsed in 1905 allowing for the return of club rugby, but the advent of the professional code, rugby league, in New South Wales saw many union players leaving for Sydney to play rugby league and get paid in the process, something which the amateur code of rugby union could not offer. In 1908, the QRU banned its players from going to Sydney to play rugby league, which resulted in disgruntled players forming the Queensland Rugby League. Of particular note was that at this time, league put down strong roots in the bush and in working class communities and these areas are still the heartland of the modern game of rugby league.\nIn 1913 nine Christian Brothers' College Football Club (Brothers) players represented Queensland in the interstate clash in Sydney and helped the team to a 22 - 21 victory.\nBrothers were such a strong club in these years that they entered two teams \"A\" &amp; \"B\" in the senior premiership in 1914 with the teams meeting each other in the Hospital Cup. Both sides were strong and contained internationals and interstate representative players. During these pre war years Brothers also won the inaugural \"College\" grade competition in 1911.\nWorld War I, from 1916 to 1918, was almost the final death blow to rugby union in Queensland. Many players went away to war and never returned, and the burgeoning popularity of the professional code saw some major clubs and all the GPS schools switch to rugby league. It seemed that the resultant disbandment of the QRU at the end of the 1919 season, heralded the end of rugby union in Queensland.\nHowever, all was not lost. In 1928, the QRU reformed and the major clubs and GPS schools returned to union as a result of bickering amongst league officials and the Senior Club competition restarted in 1929. World War II saw the game struggle once more, but this time it was strong enough to pull through and rugby union continued to grow. In 1950, the QRU secured the use of Normanby at a nominal rent from the Brisbane Grammar School Board of Trustees. In 1961, the Queensland Junior Rugby Union was formed and 1965 saw the formation of the Queensland Country Rugby Union. And finally, in 1966, the QRU moved to the home of Queensland rugby union, Ballymore.\nHaving paid a secretary to perform various tasks during the 1960s and 1970s, \"Terry Doyle\" was appointed as the first chief executive officer of the QRU in 1980. He stayed with the QRU until 1996 and saw the organisation grow from one person to 32 personnel.\nFrom 1980 to 1997, the QRU offices were located underneath the \"McLean Stand\" at Ballymore. In 1997, the administration arm moved to Mallon Street, in the Brisbane suburb of Bowen Hills. The Reds staff, however, remained at Ballymore and were joined in 1998 by the staff of the \"Reds Rugby College\". And finally, in 2004, the administration personnel were relocated to the newly built \"Rugby House\" at Ballymore, bringing the entire organisation back to one location.\nRecent events.\nRugby union in Queenlsand has seen extremely high growth since the 2003 Rugby World Cup.\nThere are now more than 50,000 players throughout Queensland, including 8,600 seniors, 23,000 regular school players (more than any other state) and over 14,000 junior club players. \nThere are 200 clubs throughout the state and more than 235 Queensland schools - with many non-traditional rugby schools adopting the code as well. Queenlsand Rugby is held together by the strong and dedicated supporters. More than 8,000 volunteers work to support their clubs around the state.\nQueensland state team.\nIntercolony/Interstate matches.\nThe year 1882 saw the first of many intercolony and interstate matches between Queensland and New South Wales rugby union teams. New South Wales took out the inaugural match, 28-4. The following year, Brisbane hosted its first intercolony match, defeating New South Wales 12-11 at the Eagle Farm Racecourse. Today, the Queensland team in Super Rugby, the Queensland Reds, face NSW, ACT, WA and Victoria representative teams home and away each season.\nNational championships.\nThe National Rugby Championship (NRC) was launched by the ARU in 2014, reinstating the national competition after an absence of six years. The previous competition was the Australian Rugby Championship (ARC) which was discontinued after only one season in 2007. The NRC is contested by nine professional teams from around Australia, with the season running from August through to November.\nQueensland is represented by two teams in the NRC:\nThe teams are based in the same cities as the former ARC sides, the Ballymore Tornadoes, and East Coast Aces respectively. Both are managed by the QRU, with the coaching and training programs used at the Queensland Reds extended to players joining the NRC teams from the Reds and local Queensland clubs.\nBrisbane City won the inaugural NRC competition, defeating Perth Spirit in the 2014 grand final.\nCompetitions.\nPremier rugby.\nQueensland Premier Rugby is currently the highest level competition in the state and equivalent to the Shute Shield in NSW. There are currently nine teams that compete in the annual competition:\nCountry rugby.\nThe Queensland Country Rugby Union has eleven country sub-unions, each running their own club competitions during the year. The sub-unions are grouped into three regional divisions in Northern, Central, and Southern Queensland:\nNorth Queensland\nCentral Queensland\nSouth Queensland\nSub-union teams compete in Regional Championships against other teams in their regional division. Representative sides from the three regions are then selected to play at the Queensland Country Championships.\nFollowing the Country Championships, a representative Queensland Country Heelers team is selected by the Queensland Country Rugby Union to play regular fixtures including City-Country matches against Brisbane selections, and the \"Battle of the Borders\" Cup against the New South Wales Country Cockatoos.\nQueensland State Cup.\nThe Queensland State Cup was an early-season statewide premier competition that was run for just one season in 2009. It involved 16 Queensland teams; 9 Brisbane clubs and 7 teams based in the major sub-unions of Queensland Country. The competition ran prior to the Queensland Premier Rugby competition. Due to logistical issues the competition has now ceased.\nBrisbane club rugby.\nClub rugby in Brisbane starts at an Under 7 years of age level and goes right up to an open age group level just below the premier level.\nSuburban rugby.\nThe grassroots rugby competition colloquially known as \"Subbies\" in Brisbane and South East Queensland is run by the Queensland Suburban Rugby Union (QSRU). The purpose of this competition is to provide community-based recreation for participants, irrespective of ability. It provides another tier of rugby behind the main Brisbane club competition.\nThe \"Subbies\" competition has around 1,000 players and 25 clubs competing across 3 divisions: As of 2014, the First Division clubs competing for the Barber Cup and Pegg Cup are:\nThe QSRU also selects a Queensland Suburban team to play an annual match against New South Wales Suburban for the Barraclough Shield.\nWomen's rugby.\nClub competitions for women's 15-a-side teams are run in Brisbane, Sunshine Coast and Cairns. The Queensland Rugby Union sends a Queensland side to the ARU's National Championship each year. Queensland also selects 7-a-side teams to compete in the National Sevens Championships and tournaments such as the Darwin Hottest Sevens.\nThe ten clubs in the Brisbane Women's competition, as of 2014, are:\nSchools and Junior rugby.\nThe Queensland Rugby Football Schools Union (QRFSU) administers the game within Queensland schools and selects state teams for national championships at various age group levels, including the Australian Schools Rugby Championships.\nClubs for junior rugby players (up to 17 years of age) operate within the Queensland Junior Rugby Union (QJRU), which also holds state championships for representative teams from metropolitan and country regions.\nBallymore Cup.\nThe Ballymore Cup is the largest school boys rugby competition in Queensland. It was founded to promote the sport of rugby across rural and metropolitan Queensland. The winner of the 2012 Ballymore Cup in the open age went to Rockhampton Grammar, and in the under-15's St Brendan's College, Yeppoon."

        "title": "List of Australia One Day International cricket records",
        "text": "One Day International (ODI) cricket is one of three forms of cricket played at international level. Unlike Test cricket, ODIs consist of one innings per team and is played over the course of single day. Each innings is limited to a maximum of 50 overs, although previously this has been 55 or 60 overs. Matches are played by the twelve teams representing full member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC), each of which have permanent ODI status, as well as the eight Associate members of the ICC that currently have temporary ODI status. Australia played in the inaugural ODI match against England on 5 January 1971 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. They have played a total of 975 matches, second only to India who have played 1,020. , Australia is the most third-most successful team in ODI cricket with an overall winning percentage of 63.39, behind the ACC Asia XI on 66.66 percent and South Africa on 63.41.\nTop order batsman and former captain Ricky Ponting holds several Australian ODI cricket records. Playing between 1995 and 2012, he scored 13,589 runs, making him the only Australian player to score 10,000 ODI runs. He has scored a record 82 half-centuries and 29 centuries. As a slip fielder, Ponting has also taken the most catches for Australia with 159. Captaining his side from 2002 until his retirement in 2012, Ponting holds the ODI record for the most matches played as captain with 230 and the record for the most matches played for Australia with 374.\nFast bowlers Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee share the record for the most ODI wickets taken for Australia with 380. McGrath also holds the record for the best figures taken by an Australian in an ODI match with 7/15 while Lee holds the Australian ODI record for the most five-wicket hauls with nine. Adam Gilchrist is Australia's most successful wicket-keeper having taken 470 dismissals and holds the ODI record for the most catches taken as a wicket-keeper with 417. Gilchrist also holds the Australian record for playing 97 consecutive ODI matches between 1997 and 2001.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, ties and no results and the partnership records. Tied records for fifth place are also included. Explanations of the general symbols and cricketing terms used in the list are given below. Specific details are provided in each category where appropriate. All records include matches played for Australia only, and are correct .\nTeam records.\nOverall Record.\nNote: Tied matches considered as half win.\nW/L ratio and win % excluded the matches which ended in No result.\nTeam wins, losses, ties and no results.\n, Australia has played 975 ODI matches resulting in 592 victories, 340 defeats, 9 ties and 34 no results for an overall winning percentage of 63.39, the third highest winning percentage of ODI playing teams. Australia has played the second-highest number of ODI matches, behind India who have competed in 1,020. Australia has played matches against 18 of the 27 other ODI teams. They have yet to play against the Africa XI, the ACC Asia XI, Bermuda, East Africa, Hong Kong, Nepal, Oman, Papua New Guinea and the United Arab Emirates. Australia has never lost a match against Afghanistan, Ireland or any of the ICC Associate Members that they have played.\nTeam scoring records.\nMost runs in an innings.\nThe highest innings total scored in ODI cricket came in the series between England and the Netherlands in June 2022. Playing in the first ODI at VRA Cricket Ground, Amstelveen the tourists posted a total of 4/498. This broke the record of 6/481 also set by England at Trent Bridge against Australia three years prior. The fifth ODI of the 2005–06 series against South Africa saw Australia set their highest innings total of 4/434, the eighth-highest score in ODI cricket.\nHighest successful run chases.\nSouth Africa claims the highest successful run chase in ODI cricket when they scored 9/438 chasing a target of 435 runs. This came during the final ODI match of Australia's tour of South Africa in 2005–06 at Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. The fourth ODI of the 2018–19 series against India saw Australia achieve their highest successful run chase in the format. Set 359 for victory at Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra in Mohali, Australia reached the target with 13 balls to spare.\nFewest runs in an innings.\nThe lowest innings total scored in ODI cricket came in the third ODI of Sri Lanka's tour of Zimbabwe in April 2004. Zimbabwe in the first innings was bowled all out for 35 runs. This record was equalled in February 2020 in the final match of the Nepal Tri-Nation Series where the hosts bowled out the United States. Australia's lowest total of 70 has been set twice. The first came during the second ODI against England in 1977 and again eight years later during the 1985–86 Australian Tri-Series against New Zealand.\nMost runs conceded an innings.\nAustralia conceded the highest total of 481 against England in 2018. At that time, It was highest One Day International score for any team later it was broken by England once again by scoring 498 against Netherlands in 2022.\nResult records.\nA ODI match is won when one side has scored more runs than the total runs scored by the opposing side during their innings. If both sides have completed their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher number of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nGreatest win margins (by runs).\nThe greatest winning margin by runs in ODI cricket was India's victory over Sri Lanka at the Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram in January 2023 where the hosts won by a margin of 317 runs. The next largest victory was Australia's defeat of the Netherlands during the 2023 World Cup by 309 runs.\nGreatest win margins (by 10 wickets).\nAustralia have won an ODI match by a margin of 10 wickets on 5 occasions, the most recent being against India in January 2020.\nGreatest win margins (by balls remaining).\nThe group stage of the 1979 World Cup saw England run down the target of 46 runs to defeat Canada by a margin of 8 wickets with 277 balls remaining in the 60-over innings, the largest victory by balls remaining in ODI cricket history. The next largest victory was Sri Lanka's win against Zimbabwe in the opening match of the 2001 LG Abans Triangular Series at the Singhalese Sports Club Cricket Ground in Colombo, where the hosts reached the target of 39 runs with 274 balls to spare. Australia's only ODI match to date against the United States, , at the 2004 Champions Trophy, saw the 66-run target achieved by Australia with 253 balls remaining in their innings – the sixth highest overall.\nNarrowest win margins (by 1 run).\nThirty-three ODI matches have been won by a margin of one run with Australia having won six of them, the most recent being third ODI against Pakistan at the Zayed Sports City Stadium in Abu Dhabi in October 2014.\nNarrowest win margins (by 1 wicket).\nSixty-six ODI matches have been won by a margin of one wicket with Australia having won four of them, the most recent being against England in the second ODI in January 2014 at The Gabba. Set 301 for victory, Australia found themselves at 9/244 with seven overs remaining. However, a man of the match performance from James Faulkner who top scored with 69 not out got Australia home with three balls remaining.\nNarrowest win margins (by balls remaining).\nThirty-seven ODI matches have been won on the final ball of the match with Australia having done so on four occasions. The most recent , was against Pakistan during the group stage of the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. Set 206 runs for victory, the winning run was a bye off the bowling of Umar Gul with Nathan Hauritz and Brett Lee at the crease.\nGreatest loss margins (by runs).\nThe third and final ODI of Sri Lanka's tour of India saw tourists being defeated by 317 runs, the greatest losing margin by runs in ODI cricket. Australia's largest defeat by number of runs came during the third ODI against England at Trent Bridge in 2018, losing by margin of 242 runs.\nGreatest loss margins (by wickets).\nAustralia have lost an ODI match by a margin of 10 wickets on only one occasion – against New Zealand in February 2007. Playing at the Wellington Regional Stadium, Australia was bowled all out for 148 runs in 49.3 overs. In reply, New Zealand reached the target in 27 overs for the loss of no wickets.\nGreatest loss margins (by balls remaining).\nCanada suffered the greatest defeat in ODI cricket during the 1979 World Cup when England run down the target of 46 runs with 277 balls remaining. The Gabba played host to Australia's worst defeat in January 2013 when Sri Lanka scored the 75 runs required for victory with 180 balls remaining.\nNarrowest loss margins (by runs).\nThirty-three ODI matches have been lost by a margin of one run with Australia having lost five of them, the most recent being in February 2004 at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium against Sri Lanka.\nNarrowest loss margins (by wickets).\nODI cricket has seen sixty-six matches been decided by a margin of one wicket, with Australia being defeated in seven of them.

Australia's undefeated run during the 2003 Cricket World Cup saw Glenn McGrath take 7/15 against in Namibia and Andy Bichel 7/20 against England for the third and fifth best in ODI history. These performances broke the long-standing Australian record of Gary Gilmour's 6/14 set during the semi-final of 1975 Cricket World Cup against England.\nBest career average.\nA bowler's bowling average is the total number of runs they have conceded divided by the number of wickets they have taken.\nNepalese leg spinner Sandeep Lamichhane holds the record for the best career average in ODI cricket with 18.06, .

Australia's Mick Lewis, playing in his seventh and subsequent final match, returned figures of 0/113 from his 10 overs in the second innings of the match. During the ODI series in 2018 where England whitewashed Australia 5–0, Australia recorded their second and fourth worst individual bowling performances.

Since then a further nine glovemen have matched this feat on a single occasion with Gilchrist achieving it five more times. Pakistan's Sarfaraz Ahmed was the most recent wicket-keeper to achieve the milestone, taking six dismissals against South Africa during 2015 World Cup.\nMost dismissals in a bilateral series.\nThe ODI cricket record for the most dismissals taken by a wicket-keeper in a bilateral series is held by Brendon McCullum of New Zealand with 19 taken during the seven-match 2002–03 series against India. He sits ahead of Brad Haddin who during the five-match ODI series against Pakistan in 2009–10 took 17.\nFielding records.\nMost career catches.\nCaught is one of the nine methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket. A fair catch is defined as a fielder catching the ball, from a legal delivery, fully within the field of play without it bouncing when the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat. The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen.\nSri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene holds the record for the most catches in ODI cricket by a non-wicket-keeper with 218. He is followed former Australian captain Ricky Ponting who secured 160 catches in his ODI career.\nMost catches in a bilateral series.\nThe seven-match 2002–03 series between New Zealand and India saw the record set for the most catches taken by a non-wicket-keeper in an ODI series with New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming taking 10 catches.

Andy Flower of Zimbabwe is second with 172 and South African Hansie Cronje with 162 is third. Adam Gilchrist with 97 consecutive matches is the highest ranked Australian player. Flower's run of 172 matches is the highest from ODI debut with Steve Waugh's 87 consecutive matches also starting since his debut in 1986.\nMost matches as captain.\nRicky Ponting, who led the Australian cricket team from 2002 to 2012, holds the record for the most matches played as captain in ODI cricket with 230. Stephen Fleming, who skippered New Zealand from 1997 to 2007 is second with 218 matches. India's captain from 2007 to 2018, MS Dhoni, is third on the list with 200. In fifth on 178 is Australia's Allan Border who led the side for ten years from 1985 to 1994.\nYoungest players.\nThe youngest player to play in an ODI match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 233 days. Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 30 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time. The youngest Australian to play ODI cricket was Pat Cummins who at the age of 18 years and 164 days debuted in the first ODI of the series against South Africa in October 2011 eclipsing the record that Josh Hazlewood had set against England 16 months earlier.\nOldest players on debut.\nAt 47 years and 240 days, Nolan Clarke, playing for the Netherlands in 1996 Cricket World Cup, is the oldest player to make his debut in ODI cricket.

The first ODI match was played prior to the Test series where he made his debut in the format aged 42 years and 19 days, the oldest Australian to do so.\nOldest players.\nThe Netherlands' fifth and final match in the 1996 Cricket World Cup saw Nolan Clarke set the record for the oldest player to appear in an ODI match at 47 years and 257 days. The oldest Australian cricketer to play in the international format is Bob Simpson. As above, Simpson was called lead the national side for the 1978 West Indies tour. The second ODI following the Test series, was his second and final ODI match where aged 42 years and 68 days he led Australia to victory.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nAs of November 2023, Australia only hold the world record for the 8th-wicket partnership, with a 202* stand between Glenn Maxwell and Pat Cummins against Afghanistan at the 2023 World Cup. The eighth wicket partnership of 119 by the pairing of Paul Reiffel and Shane Warne in 1994 against South Africa was also an ODI wicket partnership record at the time of posting.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest ODI partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the West Indian pairing of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels who put together a second wicket partnership of 372 runs during the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe. Fellow West Indians John Campbell and Shai Hope sit in second with their 365 for the opening stand against Ireland in 2019. India's Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid hold the third-highest ODI partnership with 331 made in 1999 against New Zealand. The final ODI against Pakistan in 2017 saw openers David Warner and Travis Head make 284, Australia's highest ODI partnership.\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nAleem Dar of Pakistan holds the record for the most ODI matches umpired with 219, . Still active, Dar set the record in November 2020 overtaking Rudi Koertzen from South Africa mark of 209. They are followed by New Zealand's Billy Bowden who has officiated in 200. The most experienced Australians are Daryl Harper and Simon Taufel who are equal fifth on the list with each having umpired 174 ODI matches."

Born in Lawton, Oklahoma, Jordan stood tall and weighed . He threw and batted right-handed.\nBiography.\nJordan's professional career took place over a twenty-year period, beginning in the minor leagues in 1938 and ending in 1957 after he was a playing manager for a number of unaffiliated teams in the low minors in the Southwestern United States. He spent the entire 1946 campaign in the major leagues, starting with the White Sox before being traded to Cleveland for fellow catcher Frankie Hayes on July 5. As a member of the Indians, on August 25, he hit his only major league home run, a solo shot at Fenway Park off 20-game-winner Boo Ferriss in a 2–1 Boston Red Sox win.\nDuring his big-league career, Jordan collected 23 hits in 96 at bats, including four doubles and two triples.

        "title": "2009 Monaco Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2009 Monaco Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2009) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 24 May 2009 at the Circuit de Monaco, in Monaco. The race, which was contested over 78 laps, was the sixth round of the 2009 Formula One season. It was won by Brawn GP driver Jenson Button, with his teammate Rubens Barrichello second, and Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen third.\nThis year a \"peace and sport\" initiative was introduced on this Grand Prix under the High Patronage of Albert II, Prince of Monaco. Sébastien Bourdais scored his last world championship points at this race.\nReport.\nBackground.\nThe first five races of the championship ended with Brawn driver Jenson Button leading the Drivers Championship by 14 points from teammate Rubens Barrichello, having claimed 41 points out of a possible 45. Their Brawn GP team was leading the Constructors Championship with 68 points; second-placed Red Bull had 38.5, with their driver Sebastian Vettel third place in the drivers championship. Reigning World Champion Lewis Hamilton of McLaren was only in seventh place, having accumulated nine points.\nRed Bull had a new two-tier diffuser ready for their RB5 car in Monaco, with chief designer Adrian Newey believing it could be a real benefit to the team. The Austrian drinks company team had won the 2009 Chinese Grand Prix . They had finished third and fourth in the previous race at Barcelona. Force India had prepared several important upgrades for the VJM-02, focused upon giving high downforce by modifying the front and rear wings. This was to improve performance to score their first points, having not scored points before in a Formula One race. Most other teams, including Toyota and BMW Sauber, had modified cars to give good downforce and high mechanical grip; important for the Monaco circuit's low speed and twisting, slow corners.\nIn the run up to the race, Ferrari issued a statement declaring that \"Ferrari does not intend to enter its cars in the next Formula One World Championship.\" if \"the introduction of two different sets of regulations based on arbitrary technical rules and economic parameters.\" were to take place. This was in reference to proposed regulations by the FIA World Motor Sport Council to introduce a Budget Cap for 2010, and allow technical freedom to those teams operating under it. The Renault Formula One team made a similar statement, announcing \"If the decisions announced by the World Council on the 29th of April 2009 are not revised, we have no choice but to withdraw from the FIA Formula One World Championship at the end of 2009.\" These statements were the start of the FIA–FOTA dispute over the 2010 regulations. During the event, scenes for the 2010 film \"Iron Man 2\" were shot, which features a historic Monaco Grand Prix race. Prior to the race the drivers complained about a billboard for Martini featuring model Jessiqa Pace was distracting and in the line of sight of drivers as they exit Loews hairpin.\nPractice and qualifying.\nThe early practice sessions at Monaco are traditionally run on the Thursday of the week so that the roads can be opened on the Friday for public access. As such, two practice sessions were held on the Thursday, with the third on Saturday morning, followed shortly by qualifying.\nThe Thursday practice sessions began with Brawn GP establishing its dominance once again; Rubens Barrichello was fastest by three-tenths of a second from countryman Felipe Massa with a time of 1:17.199, and the two McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Heikki Kovalainen following shortly thereafter. The Brawns continued their form in the second session, placing third and fourth behind Nico Rosberg – who topped practice for the ninth time this season with a 1:15.243 – and Hamilton once again. A similar story held true for the Saturday session, with Jenson Button narrowly being beaten by Fernando Alonso in the Renault.\nThe first qualifying session was marked by 2008 winner Lewis Hamilton crashing at Mirabeau and damaging his suspension, putting him out of qualifying and gradually knocking him down the order until he would finish sixteenth, ahead of the BMW Saubers of Nick Heidfeld and Robert Kubica and the Toyotas of Jarno Trulli and Timo Glock. The second session saw the departure of the two Force Indias, both Toro Rossos and Nelson Piquet Jr.'s Renault while Finland's Kimi Räikkönen and Heikki Kovalainen topped the timing sheets. Giancarlo Fisichella had two times disallowed for cutting the corners at the Swimming Pool Complex and Nouvelle Chicane. The third and final session was dominated by Rubens Barrichello and Sebastian Vettel until a late lap from Jenson Button saw the championship leader take his fourth pole from six starts this season with Kimi Räikkönen the highest-placed KERS-equipped car in second place.\nRace.\nAt the start, Button maintained his lead as Barrichello passed Räikkönen on the approach to the first corner. Both Brawn cars and Sebastian Vettel started the race on the super-soft tyres; the Ferraris and Williams started on the soft compound. This provided an advantage, as the super-soft tyres – which had proven to be the better of the two all weekend – started to lose grip drastically after twelve laps as championship contender Sebastian Vettel proved when he started losing up to four seconds per lap on leader Button, because of the difficulty in overtaking at Monaco, this greatly helped the Brawn GP drivers and Kimi Räikkönen (the only three drivers ahead of Vettel when his tyres started to lose grip), because for several minutes all cars behind him found themselves unable to overtake, opening a huge gap between third and fourth, even for several laps after Vettel had been overtaken.\nSébastien Buemi had an accident running into Nelson Piquet Jr. on lap 10 during a passing attempt at Sainte Devote, while Vettel slid into the barriers under brakes at the same spot several laps later. Button maintained a fifteen-second lead over teammate Barrichello for most of the race, who had a smaller gap over the Ferraris of Kimi Räikkönen and Felipe Massa; Massa raised the ire of the stewards after crossing the chicane at the Swimming Pool Complex twice, though no penalty was awarded as both occasions were due to driver error.\nIn the late stages of the race, Heikki Kovalainen crashed out at the Swimming Pool, spinning and colliding with the barriers. Kazuki Nakajima also crashed out on the last lap of the race at Mirabeau. Robert Kubica was the only other retirement, his race ending with brake problems. In the final phase of the race, the Ferraris pitted for the super-soft tyres, discovering the same graining problem as everyone else over longer stints. The distance between Button and Barrichello halved over the final few laps, though Button was deliberately slowing to avoid encountering backmarkers who were fighting for position. He won by seven-and-a-half seconds from Barrichello, with the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Massa third and fourth.\nAfter the end of the race, Button mistakenly parked his car in parc fermé in the pit lane as is normal for other Grands Prix, rather than on the main straight with the other two podium finishers as is the norm for Monaco. As a result, he had to run down the start/finish straight to the podium.\nWith his win, Button scored the third-best start to a season in Formula One history, with five victories and one third place. Only Nigel Mansell in and Michael Schumacher in recorded better starts, with each taking five victories and one second place in the first six rounds. Also, his victory in the Brawn-Mercedes marked the first time in modern F1 history that a single engine has won three races in a row – engines in the 1950s lasted most of a season, sometimes more than one season. It was also the first time since that a driver had won three races in succession. Michael Schumacher was the last to do so, as he won the United States, French and German Grands Prix.\nClassification.\n\"Cars that used KERS are marked with\" \"‡\""

        "text": "The 2009 Kentucky Derby was the 135th running of the Kentucky Derby. The value of the race was $2,177,000 in stakes. The race was sponsored by Yum! Brands and hence officially was called Kentucky Derby Presented by Yum! Brands. The race took place on May 2, 2009, and was televised in the United States on the NBC television network. The Atlanta-based Southern Tourism Society named the Kentucky Derby Festival, which was April 11 to May 1, as one of the top tourist attractions in the Southeast for the first half of 2009. The post time was 6:24 p.m. EDT (10:24 p.m. UTC). The official attendance at Churchill Downs was 153,563.\nResults.\nThe ending of the race came as a shock to those in attendance as Mine That Bird, trained by \"Chip\" Woolley Jr. and ridden by Calvin Borel, running dead last until the final turn, suddenly moved into the lead in the final furlong. He took the lead so fast after the final turn that NBC Sports race announcer Tom Durkin didn't notice the gelding and was still heatedly describing the performance of Pioneerof the Nile and Musket Man despite Mine That Bird already opening a three-length lead over the pack. Mine That Bird won by 6 lengths for the longest margin of victory in over 60 years. He was the longest-odds horse to win the Derby in over 85 years.\nPayout.\nChurchill Downs had scheduled their first futures wager pool for the year to begin on February 12, with two subsequent pools opening on March 12 and April 2. Offering 24 betting options (23 individual horses at odds ranging from 10–1 to 50–1, and an \"All others\" option at 5-2 odds), favorites include Capt. Candyman Can and Old Fashioned at 10–1, followed by Friesan Fire, Midshipman, Pioneerof the Nile, Stardom Bound, This Ones for Phil, and Vineyard Haven at 12–1.\nAfter the starter draw for the running, I Want Revenge was installed as the 3-1 morning line favorite. His scratch later in the morning marked the first time that the morning line favorite was scratched on the day of the race.\nFriesan Fire, winner of the Louisiana Derby, started the race as the 19-5 (3.80-1) favorite.\nThe Field.\nPost positions were drawn Thursday, April 30, 2009.\nI Want Revenge was scratched on the morning of the race because of lameness issues in the colt's left front ankle. In addition, Quality Road, who had been an early favorite, was withdrawn from the race on April 27 because of a quarter crack in his right front hoof.\nSubsequent Grade I wins.\nMine That Bird never won another race, though he did finish second in the Preakness to Horse of the Year Rachel Alexandra and third in the Belmont in the same year. Several other horses went on to achieve Grade I success:\nMr. Hot Stuff never won another race on the flat, but did become a notable steeplechaser. He won the Grade I A. P. Smithwick Memorial Steeplechase Stakes in 2013 and the American Grand National Hurdle Stakes in 2014.\nSubsequent breeding careers.\nThe most notable progeny of participants in the 2009 Derby are as follows.\nPioneerof the Nile (2nd)\nChief Party Officer.\nBuilding on the longstanding tradition of drinking, partying, and general revelry in the infield, Churchill Downs officials announced that they are accepting applications to be the second \"Chief Party Officer.\" According to Chief Marketing Officer Dave Tompkins, \"The non-stop revelry can test the most die-hard partiers, so a CPO candidate must be able to take the reins and lead our infield nation to new heights of fun and frivolity.\" In an effort to promote the position, Tim \"Stymie\" Snyder, the 2008 Chief Party Officer, attended Super Bowl XLIII to personally recruit applicants. The winner was announced March 6, and prizes include use of an RV (billed as a \"luxurious boardroom on wheels\") for the year. This year's Chief Party Officer is Nick Ferrara."

        "text": "The Big South Conference men's basketball tournament (popularly known as the Big South tournament) is the conference championship tournament in basketball for the Big South Conference. The tournament has been held every year since 1986. It is a single-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season records. The winner, declared conference champion, receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA men's basketball tournament. However, the conference did not have an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament from 1986 to 1990, and in 1995.\nBefore the 1994-95 season, Campbell departed the Big South due to scheduling conflicts. This left the conference with just five teams having played at the Division I level for at least five years, short of the six such members required by the NCAA for a conference to receive an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament. As a result, the Big South did not have an automatic qualifier to the 1995 NCAA tournament, its first time without an auto-bid since 1990; it regained an auto-bid in 1996 and has maintained an auto-bid in every year since, as of 2021.\nFrom 2003 through 2012, the tournament was held mostly at campus sites. In 2003, the semifinals and finals were held at a predetermined site. After that, depending on the year, either the final, or both the semifinals and final, were hosted by the team that won the regular-season title. In 2012, the regular-season champion hosted the quarterfinals as well. Starting in 2013, the tournament was held at a single site for the first time since 2002, specifically Coastal Carolina's new HTC Center (known at the time of announcement as the Student Recreation and Convocation Center). The tournament remained at that venue until Coastal announced its 2016 departure for the Sun Belt Conference; the 2016 edition was held at the Pope Convocation Center on the campus of Campbell University. Beginning in 2017, the format changed yet again; the first round is now held at campus sites, with the quarterfinals and semifinals hosted by the regular-season winner and the final by the top surviving seed."

In 14 innings pitched, he allowed 22 hits, eight bases on balls and 15 earned runs, for a career earned run average of 9.64.\nEdmondson won 84 games in the minor leagues, including 20 for the 1927 Peoria Tractors of the Class B Three-I League. He retired in 1930."

        "title": "Don Tallon with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Don Tallon was a key member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team tour of England in 1948, in which Australia was undefeated in their 34 matches. This unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\".\nThe team's first-choice wicket-keeper ahead of Ron Saggers, Tallon played in four of the five Tests, missing the Fourth Test due to injury. Despite being the preferred gloveman, Tallon conceded byes at a higher rate than Saggers during the tour.\nBradman rotated the two glovemen during the tour, and Tallon played in 14 of the 31 first-class matches, taking 29 catches and 14 stumpings. Tallon's catch of Len Hutton in the Fifth Test at The Oval was described as Wisden as the best of the year. He also took a difficult catch to remove George Emmett in the Third Test at Old Trafford, catching a ball that flew to his feet at yorker length. However, Tallon also had some mishaps, with finger injuries inflicted by failing to catch the ball correctly. Tallon had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 283 runs at a batting average of 25.72 in 13 first-class innings, including two fifties. During the Test, Tallon scored 112 runs at 28.00, including a 53 in the Second Test that saw Australia recover to a first innings of 350 after a middle-order slump had seen England take the upper hand. He took 12 catches in the Tests.\nIn recognition of his performances, Tallon was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949.\nBackground.\nTallon's form as Australia's wicket-keeper since World War II saw him selected for the 1948 Ashes tour as part of the side that would become known to cricket history as the \"Invincibles\". Tallon was the first-choice wicket-keeper, with Saggers as his deputy. Having spent the majority of his life in sunny Queensland and growing up in tropical Bundaberg, the cold English climate initially caught Tallon off guard. He did not wet his inner gloves as was his custom due to the temperature. As England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, this meant that the ball would more frequently be in a favourable state for fast bowling, since it would swing more. As a result, Australia adopted a pace-oriented strategy and Ian Johnson was the only spinner regularly used in the Test matches. Colin McCool was not to play a Test on the tour, depriving Tallon of an opportunity to show his stumping abilities standing up at the stumps to his Queensland team-mate in the Tests.\nEarly tour.\nAustralia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Accordingly, Tallon was selected as the wicket-keeper for the match. The home side batted first and Tallon made his first dismissal on English soil by catching Worcestershire captain Allan White from the bowling of Keith Miller. He then stumped former England captain Bob Wyatt from McCool. In reply to the hosts' 233, Tallon was promoted to No. 6, but managed only six in a collapse of 4/38 before Australia recovered to declare at 8/462. He took a further three dismissals in the second innings, two of them stumpings from McCool's bowling, as Australia crushed the hosts by an innings and 17 runs. Tallon conceded 11 byes in the match.\nTallon was rested for the second tour match against Leicestershire, which Australia won by an innings with Saggers behind the stumps.\nTallon played a key role in Australia's victory in the next match against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. He came in at 7/86 and made ten in the first innings to push Australia to 101 in reply to Yorkshire's 71, in which Tallon did not concede a bye. However, Tallon was not so tidy in the second innings, conceding 11 byes as the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings. He did not make a dismissal in the match. Australia then collapsed to 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory when Tallon strode in. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia only had three wickets in hand. Australia faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. He survived an immediate leg before wicket appeal and then hit a shot that fell just short of a fielder. He then compiled 17 unbeaten runs as Australia scraped home by four wickets.\nThe Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Tallon came in with the score at 6/553, and held up his end, scoring an unbeaten 50 as his partners steadily fell and Australia were bowled out at 632. Tallon had some difficulty in English conditions as he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the match and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes. Tallon took two catches in the second innings as Australia won the match by an innings, but he also conceded 24 byes in Surrey's match total of 336.\nAfter sustaining the bruised finger, Tallon was rested for the following three matches, which were against Cambridge University, Essex and Oxford. Australia won each of the matches by an innings. Saggers filled in and scored 110 runs including a 104 not out against Essex and took five dismissals. Saggers conceded only 34 byes in his four tour matches, while Tallon had conceded 46 in three.N-\nThe next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests,N- and were basically a full strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage, and Tallon was selected despite conceding byes at a higher rate in the preceding tour matches. He made 11 batting at No. 9, including a six from Jim Laker as Australia made 552. He took three catches in the first innings, having a hand in the first three wickets to fall, Jack Robertson, Bill Edrich and Denis Compton. He then took two stumpings in the second innings as the follow on was enforced, but also conceded 26 byes as Australia won by an innings. Tallon had conceded 72 byes to Saggers' 34 with both having played four matches.N-\nFollowing the match against the MCC, there were four more county fixtures before the First Test, against Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and Sussex. Australia drew the first two before winning the latter two by eight wickets and an innings and 325 runs respectively. Tallon played in only the Nottinghamshire match, taking two catches in the first innings and two stumpings in each of the innings. The catches were all from Lindwall and the stumpings from Doug Ring. Tallon conceded 18 byes for the match and scored 27, being last man out at 400 after coming to the crease at 6/355. In Saggers's three matches, 36 byes were conceded and six dismissals were made.\nFirst Test.\nDespite averaging more byes per innings than Saggers during the warm-up matches,N- Tallon was retained in the Test team. During the First Test at Trent Bridge, Tallon took four catches. In the first innings, Tallon caught Jim Laker from the bowling of Keith Miller to end England's innings of 165 after he and Alec Bedser had joined forces at 8/74.\nWhen Australia batted, Tallon came in at 6/338 to accompany Lindsay Hassett and took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the left arm orthodox spin of Jack Young. The scoring was slow during this passage of play—Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs with Australia using leg theory.\nAfter Australia ended with 509 and took a 334-run lead, Tallon took two difficult catches to dismiss key batsmen at the start of England's second innings. Miller removed Cyril Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot to Tallon. Bill Edrich was then caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball that went straight on and the ball took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start, but they recovered. Later, he caught Godfrey Evans for 50 from Johnson as England ended at 441. Australia reached their target of 98 with two wickets down, completing an eight-wicket victory. Tallon conceded five and 12 byes in the two innings respectively.\nBetween Tests, Australia played Northamptonshire and Yorkshire, and Tallon was rested for both matches. The first was won by an innings and second was drawn. Saggers made four and 22 and conceded 24 byes in four innings.\nSecond Test.\nThe teams moved on to Lord's for the Second Test and Australia compiled 350 in its first innings. Tallon came to the crease with Australia at 6/225 after Hassett and Bill Brown had gone in quick succession, joining Johnson in the middle. Johnson struggled to score, while Tallon did so freely in the last hour. After Johnson fell for four at 7/246, Lindwall then joined Tallon and the pair survived to the close of play. England were well placed when Australia ended at stumps on 7/258 with Tallon on 25. Tallon had dominated the scoring late in day, making 25 of the 33 runs added. The crowd was optimistic about England's position and some immediately camped outside the turnstiles upon leaving the ground.\nAustralia's lower order batted the tourists into control on the second morning. Despite the loss of Lindwall for 15 at 8/275, Tallon kept on batting in a conventional manner, supported by Johnston and Ernie Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores. Both tail-enders threw the bat at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Tallon put on 45 with Johnston—who scored 29— before holing out for 53. Ending at 350, the Australians had regained the momentum, taking 92 runs from 66 minutes of hitting in the morning.\nTallon did not concede a bye in England's first innings of 215 and his diving was estimated to have saved around 40 runs. He caught Washbrook from Lindwall to leave England at 1/17, and later caught Laker from Johnson. Tallon was not needed in the second innings; Lindwall was promoted above Tallon because Australia needed quick runs and Lindwall was a big-hitter. Australia declared at 7/460, leaving England a target of 509.\nWith the score at 2/65, Washbrook inside edged a Toshack full toss directly downwards at Tallon's ankle. Bradman described the catch as \"miraculous\" because Tallon had to reach so low, so quickly, in order to take the catch. Another dive to stop a leg glance resulted in a severely bruised left little finger. Tallon conceded 16 byes in the second innings, more than 8% of England's score. Australia won the Test by 409 runs, and nursing his finger, Tallon was rested for both tour matches between the Tests, which were against Surrey and Gloucestershire, which were won by ten wickets and an innings respectively. In his place, Saggers scored 12, took nine dismissals and conceded 31 byes in four innings.\nThird Test.\nThe teams then played out a rain-affected draw in the Third Test match at Manchester, where England elected to bat first. On the first day, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall delivery and was caught by Tallon for 32, leaving England at 5/119. Compton returned at the fall of Edrich's wicket after previously leaving the ground after being bloodied in the head by a Lindwall bouncer. He batted to stumps, after being dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before again being dropped on 64 late in the day by the gloveman from the bowling of Johnston. England closed at 7/231 with Compton on 64.\nOn the second morning, Tallon again dropped Compton from Johnston when the batsman was on 73. England eventually finished on 363, with Compton not out on 145. Thus Tallon's drops cost 95 runs as well as allowing Compton to hold up one end so his partners could score. Tallon also conceded seven byes.\nAustralia reached 3/135 when Miller and Arthur Morris departed in quick succession. With Sid Barnes retiring hurt because of a blow to the ribs, Tallon came in at 5/139, effectively six wickets down and made 18 in half an hour before falling at 6/172. Australia managed to reach 221 and avoid the follow on.\nEngland batted again and Tallon dismissed George Emmett from Lindwall with a diving one-handed catch. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who took it in his right hand with a dive, leaving England at 1/1. England then declared at 3/174; Tallon conceded nine byes and with more than a day was lost to rain, Tallon was not required as Australia batted out the last session for a draw.\nTallon's little left finger swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during a tour match against Middlesex. In this match, he scored 17, took two catches and a stumping in the first innings and conceded only seven byes for the entire match as Australia won by ten wickets.\nFourth Test.\nThe left finger injury ruled him out of the Fourth Test at Headingley, and he was replaced by Saggers. Australia set a world record in successfully chasing a target of 404 to win the match by seven wickets and secure the series. Saggers leaked only six byes in 299.1 overs of glovework during the match as Australia conceded a total of 861 runs for the match. It was the lowest percentage of byes conceded in a match total by an Australian wicket-keeper for the tour (0.697%).N-\nTallon missed the innings victory over Derbyshire, before returning against Glamorgan. In his first match back from injury, Tallon took a catch and two stumpings as the hosts were dismissed for 197, but he also conceded 19 byes. Byes made 9.64% of the match total conceded by Australia, the highest proportion by the tourists during the summer.N- He did not bat as rain ended the match with Australia at 3/215. He was rested for the nine-wicket win over Warwickshire, before returning for Australia's second match and second draw against Lancashire. Tallon came in at 7/232 and scored 33, adding 63 with Ian Johnson to help Australia reach 321. He took two catches and two stumpings but also conceded 23 byes. In the non-first-class match against Durham, Tallon played purely as a batsman, while Saggers kept wicket. He opened the batting, but was dismissed for one as Australia made 273 and the hosts reached 5/73 before rain ended the match.\nFifth Test.\nTallon returned for the Fifth Test at The Oval, where England elected to bat first on a rain-affected pitch. Tallon caught Jack Crapp from an outside edge for a duck from the bowling of Miller, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. England continued to struggle against the moving ball and were all out for 52 in the middle session. The innings ended when Tallon took an acrobatic catch to dismiss Len Hutton down the leg side, catching it with his left hand. It was considered the catch of the season by \"Wisden\". Tallon conceded six byes in the innings.\nAustralia batted and passed England's total on the first afternoon. Tallon came in to bat on the second day with the score at 7/332, joining opener Morris, who had already passed 150. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run to third man after being called through by Tallon but was not quick enough for the substitute fielder's arm, leaving Australia at 8/359. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Doug Ring, before both were out on 389, ending Australia's innings. In the second innings, Tallon caught Hutton from Miller and conceded nine byes as England were dismissed for 188 and lost by an innings, sealing a 4–0 series victory for Australia.\nLater tour matches.\nSeven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Tallon was rested for three consecutive matches against Kent, the Gentlemen of England, and Somerset, all of which Australia won by an innings. Saggers stood in and made seven dismissals and conceded 29 byes in the six innings of the three matches.\nHe returned for the following match against the South of England. He did not bat as Australia declared at 7/522. He then took three catches and conceded 13 byes as the match was washed out when the hosts were dismissed for 298.\nAustralia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play for the hosts. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Johnson coming for Doug Ring. Tallon made two as Australia declared at 8/489. He conceded seven byes and did not make a dismissal as the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.\nThe tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, Tallon played as a batsman while Saggers kept wicket. Tallon scored only six in Australia's 236 and then took 0/10 in Scotland's second innings and did not take a catch in the innings victory. In the second match in Aberdeen, Tallon kept wicket, conceding 26 byes and not taking a dismissal and he was not required to bat. When the match became safe, with Australia in an unassailable position in Scotland's second innings, Bradman allowed Tallon to dispense with his wicket-keeping pads and try his luck at bowling leg spin. Tallon never bowled in his Test career and only rarely in first-class cricket, where he delivered 301 balls, the approximate workload of a specialist bowler in one match. Tallon took 2/15 as Australia finished the tour with another innings win.\nRole.\nTallon had had moderate success with his batting during the Test series, aggregating 114 runs at 28.50. He usually batted at No. 8, and only had four innings as Australia's batting strength was such that he did not need to bat in the second innings in any of the Tests. The Australian team strategy of primarily depending on fast bowling saw Tallon make 12 catches and no stumpings during the Tests. However, Bradman gave his lead pace bowlers Miller and Lindwall more rest during the tour games to save energy for the Tests, and relied more heavily on the off spin of Ian Johnson and the leg spin of McCool and Doug Ring in the county matches. Thus overall Tallon took 29 catches and 14 stumpings for the first-class matches during the tour. Tallon scored 283 runs at 25.72 for the season at an average higher than Saggers's 23.22. In all his matches on tour, Tallon conceded 249 byes as Australia conceded 5331 runs, a bye percentage of 4.67%, compared to Saggers's 221 byes from 6190 runs, a percentage of 3.57%.N-\nDuring the tour, Tallon had few opportunities with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 9,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included the likes of Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable with the bat. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, including one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As Australia often won by an innings, and often declared in the first innings, Tallon only had 13 innings in his 14 first-class fixtures and was not out two times as he ran out of partners.\nTallon's performances during the English summer saw him named by \"Wisden\" as one of its five Cricketers of the Year.\nNotes.\nStatistical notes.\nn-[1]\nThis statement regarding byes in the early warm-up matches can be verified by summation of the scorecards, as listed here.\nn-[2]\nThis statement regarding the team composition can be verified by inspecting the records of the respective matches, as attached.\nn-[3]\nThis statement regarding byes in the warm-up matches can be verified by summation of the scorecards, as listed here.\nn-[4]\nThis statement can be verified by consulting all of the scorecards for the matches, as listed here."

        "title": "Ernie Toshack with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Ernie Toshack was a member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948 and was undefeated in their 34 matches. This unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned Bradman's men the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\".\nA left-arm medium-pace seam bowler, Toshack was a member of the first-choice team, and played in the first four Test matches before succumbing to a persistent knee injury. Toshack contained the English batsmen with leg theory in between the new ball bursts of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall. He took 11 wickets in the Tests; his most notable performance was the 5/40 he took in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's. However, his knee failed in the first innings of the Fourth Test when he took 1/112. He was unable to bowl in the second innings and missed the Fifth Test, marking the end of his Test career.\nFor the entire tour, Toshack took 50 first-class wickets at a bowling average of 21.12 with four five-wicket innings hauls, including a best of 7/81 against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane. He also took 6/51 in the first innings of the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club, who were almost entirely represented by English Test cricketers, playing a key part in an innings victory. With little batting ability, Toshack usually batted last in Australia's line-up and scored 78 runs at a batting average of 8.66, the worst first-class aggregate and average among the tourists. However, in the Tests, he was dismissed only once and averaged 51.00 with a series of tail-wagging performances, including his career best of 20 not out.\nBackground.\nA left-arm medium-pacer, Toshack made his first-class cricket debut in the 1945–46 upon the resumption of cricket after World War II. His performances were enough to ensure his selection for the tour of New Zealand in early 1946, where Toshack made his Test debut in the one-off match against the hosts' national team. From then on, Toshack was a regular member of the national team and played in every Test over the next two summers, fitness permitting. Toshack played in eight of the 11 Tests during this period, taking 36 wickets. Towards the end of the Test series against India in 1947–48 in Australia, knee injuries began to hamper Toshack, and he was in doubt for the 1948 tour of England. He only made the trip after a 3–2 majority vote by a medical panel, despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Two Melbourne doctors ruled him unfit, but three specialists from his home state of New South Wales presented a more optimistic outlook; this allowed him to tour. As a member of Bradman's \"Invincibles\", the tour was to immortalise him in cricketing history. He grew tired of signing autographs during the sea voyage to England, and entrusted a friend with the task. However, his friend was unaware of the correct spelling of his name; as a result, there are still sheets in circulation signed \"Toshak\". The team manager Keith Johnson gave Toshack a talking to over this incident.\nEarly tour matches.\nAustralia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Toshack was included, reinforcing the new ball attack of Lindwall and Miller and the off spin and leg spin of Ian Johnson and Colin McCool respectively. Australia bowled first, and Toshack took two quick wickets to reduce the hosts to 3/158 after a 137-run second wicket partnership. Toshack ended with 2/39 as Australia dismissed Worcestershire for 233. He was not required to bat as Australia made 8/462 declared, and then took 1/40 in the second innings as the tourists started their campaign with an innings victory, setting the tone for the summer.\nToshack was then rested for the second tour match against Leicestershire, which Australia won by an innings. He then missed the next match against Yorkshire, as Australia came closest to losing a match on the tour, scraping home by four wickets on a damp wicket.\nToshack returned as the Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval, and he had his first outing with the bat on English soil, coming in last and scoring eight to help wicket-keeper Don Tallon add 33 for the final wicket before Australia were bowled out for 632. Toshack bowled without success in the first innings and took one wicket in the second innings, that of Arthur McIntyre, to end with match figures of 1/54 as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Toshack then took 2/32 in the first innings against Cambridge University, and did not bat as Australia declared at 4/414. He then took 0/9 from eight overs in the second innings, as Australia completed another innings victory. He then played in the match against Essex where Australia made 721 runs on the first day to set a new world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket. However, Toshack only contributed four runs batting at No. 11. In the first innings, Toshack took the last five wickets to fall, including the top-scorer Ray Smith for 25, ending with 5/31 from 10.5 overs as the hosts capitulated for 83, unable to cope with his swing. Australia enforced the follow on and Toshack took a further 2/50 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings and 451 runs, the largest margin of the tour. He then faced Oxford University, scoring two runs in Australia's 431. Toshack then took three lower order wickets in the first innings to end with 3/34 from 22 overs, sending down more overs than any other Australian. He took 3/37 in the second innings as Australia completed another innings victory after enforcing the follow on. The Oxford batsmen had trouble with the seam movement of Toshack.\nToshack was retained for the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrich, three of England's first four batsmen in the Tests, all playing. Toshack was the last man in and made two, accompanying Lindwall in a 20-run final wicket stand as Australia totalled 552.\nAfter the MCC had reached 2/91, Toshack broke through the middle order. He had Compton caught behind by Don Tallon for 26, before trapping the incoming batsman Martin Donnelly—a New Zealand Test player—leg before wicket for five, and then having Hutton caught by vice-captain Lindsay Hassett for 52 a run later, leaving the hosts at 5/104. After the hosts recovered to 6/148, Toshack removed Test all rounder Ken Cranston, Test wicket-keeper Billy Griffith and spinner Jack Young to leave the MCC at 9/166. The MCC were eventually dismissed for 189, conceding a first innings lead of 363 runs. Toshack had taken 6/51 from 27 overs, and Bradman only allowed him four overs of rest. The Australian captain opted to enforce the follow on and allowed Toshack a lighter load in the second innings, bowling 15 overs and taking 1/43. He removed Edrich as the MCC fell for 205 in 60.2 overs to lose by an innings and 158 runs. Toshack had sent down the most overs by any Australian bowler in both innings. Bradman regarded Toshack's first innings performance as his best of the tour. Toshack again focused on the leg stump, which some English observers decried as being negative. However, former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Toshack's line was close enough to leg stump that most balls had to be played.\nIn the next match against Lancashire, Toshack made four in Australia's 204, before claiming both openers after they had put on 48, including Test batsman Cyril Washbrook. Toshack ended with 2/40 as the match ended in a draw after the first day was washed out. It was Australia's first non-victory of the tour. After six consecutive matches in the space of 21 days, Toshack was rested for the next two matches against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge and Hampshire; the matches ended in a draw and an eight-wicket Australian win respectively.\nToshack returned for the final county match against Sussex before the First Test. He did not take a wicket but pinned down the local batsmen as Lindwall blasted them out with match figures of 11/59. Eight of Lindwall's victims had their stumps knocked over. Toshack bowled 15 overs for 23 runs in the first innings as the hosts were skittled for 86. He did not bat as Australia made 5/549 and then returned in the second innings for 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots for a total of six runs. He finished the match with a total of 0/29 from 32 overs.\nFirst Test.\nToshack's performance in the First Test at Trent Bridge was a quiet one, taking a single wicket in each innings. England won the toss and elected to bat. Toshack trapped the home captain Norman Yardley leg before wicket with a ball that straightened after pitching, ending with 1/28 as England were bowled out for 165. Toshack then came to the wicket at 9/476 and was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 33 with Johnston, scoring 19 runs—his best at Test level to date—in just 18 minutes, batting in a carefree and freewheeling manner, before falling lbw to Alec Bedser, ending Australia's innings on 509 with a 344-run lead.\nDuring the second innings, Bradman thought that rain might come so he utilised Toshack to bowl defensive leg theory. He did so to slow the scoring so that England would not have a lead by the time the rain came to create a sticky wicket, otherwise Australia would have been forced to chase a target on a difficult pitch with irregular bounce and pace. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced proceedings to continue as they posed no injury threat to the batsmen. Early on the fourth morning, Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly while bowling to Hutton and Denis Compton, but Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day as soon as it was available, taking Toshack off. Later, Toshack was used defensively while Miller attacked from the other end. Bradman's response to a boundary being hit from Toshack was to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions, and scoring was slow as Toshack bowled accurately. Toshack took the wicket of Joe Hardstaff junior for 43, who holed out to Hassett on the leg side, having supported Denis Compton in a partnership of 93. The ball looped up in the air and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Toshack ended with 1/60 from 33 overs as Australia were one bowler short after an injury to Lindwall had prevented him from bowling since the first afternoon. England were bowled out for 441 and Australia reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand.\nToshack was rested for the first tour match after the First Test against Northamptonshire, which Australia won by an innings. He returned against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, making four as Australia batted first and scored 249. He then recorded the best innings analysis of his first-class career, taking 7/81 from 40 consecutive overs, bemusing the Yorkshire spectators with his Australian accent and distinctive \"Ow Wizz Ee\" appealing. He removed both openers, including Hutton, and then bowled Yorkshire and England captain Norman Yardley to leave the hosts at 3/107. After Yorkshire reached 4/149, Toshack took four more wickets as the hosts collapsed to be all out for 206. Wicket-keeper Ron Saggers stood up to the wickets and stumped Ted Lester before Toshack removed three lower-order batsmen. Toshack did not bat or bowl again as the match petered into a draw. Bradman decided to bat until late on the third afternoon and secure a draw instead of pressing for a win; Yorkshire only batted for 27 overs in their second innings and the crowd booed Bradman for not pursuing a victory. With the match safe, Bradman elected to rely mainly on his second-choice bowlers to conserve his frontline bowlers' energy for the next Test.\nSecond Test.\nAustralia won the toss and batted first in the Second Test at Lord's. They were on the back foot at 7/258 at stumps on the first day. On the second morning, the Australian lower order counter-attacked; Toshack joined Johnston with the score at 9/320 and they put on 30 runs before Johnston was stumped. Australia regained the momentum, adding 92 runs in 66 minutes of hitting in the morning. One sequence of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers. Both players swung wildly at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Both made new Test best scores; Toshack scored 20 not out. Both Johnston and Toshack—not known for their batting ability—played without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck. England were then bowled out for 215. Toshack was wicketless, but was the most economical of the bowlers, conceding only 23 runs from his 18 overs. Toshack operated after the first new ball was taken, and as England had fallen to 4/46, they played him cautiously in an attempt to rebuild the innings. Australia then declared at 7/460 in their second innings with Toshack not required to bat, leaving England a target of 596.\nEngland progressed to 1/52 in their run-chase before a double strike by Toshack. Edrich and Washbrook fell in quick succession to leave England at 3/65. Edrich edged to Johnson low down in the slips and Tallon took a difficult catch to remove Washbrook. Edrich decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken, thinking that he may have hit a bump ball into the ground before it flew to Johnson, but the umpire ruled otherwise and gave him out. Washbrook inside edged a Toshack full toss directly downwards at Tallon's ankle. Bradman described the catch as \"miraculous\" because Tallon had to reach so low, so quickly, in order to complete the catch. English commentator John Arlott speculated that Edrich and Washbrook may have lost concentration after Lindwall was replaced by Toshack, lulled into a false sense of security once Australia's leading bowler was no longer operating. England then recovered to be 3/106 at stumps on the fourth day.\nYardley and Tom Dollery took the score to 4/133 on the final morning before Toshack bowled the former for 11. He then trapped Alec Coxon two balls later in the same over for a duck, leaving England at 6/133. Coxon shuffled across his stumps and missed his first delivery, which hit him in front of the stumps and prompted a loud lbw appeal, and did the same thing to the next ball, and the umpire upheld the Australians' second appeal. During this spell, Toshack conceded only seven runs from eight overs, but was taken off as Bradman wanted to take the new ball and utilise Lindwall and Johnston. The match ended when Doug Wright hit Toshack to Lindwall and England were bowled out for 186, sealing a 409-run win for Australia. Toshack ended with 5/40 from 20.1 overs with Miller unable to bowl due to injury. During the second innings performance, Toshack employed two short legs and a silly mid-off. Arlott said that while Toshack had the best figures, Lindwall was the pivotal figure, at the latter \"so patently disturbed Hutton he struck a blow at the morale of the English batting that was never overcome.\"\nA match against Surrey started the day after the Second Test ended, but Bradman nevertheless asked Toshack to bowl 20 overs as Surrey batted first. He took 2/76 including opposition captain Errol Holmes. In reply to the hosts' 221, Toshack made one in Australia's total of 389. He then removed Arthur McIntyre and Eric Bedser in the second innings and ended with 2/29 as Australia won by ten wickets. Toshack was then rested after playing 12 days of cricket in two weeks, missing the innings victory over Gloucestershire.\nThird Test.\nToshack had a moderately successful Third Test, in which England elected to bat first. England lost two early wickets, and when Toshack came on, Jack Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. As the hosts were in trouble, they played cautiously and Toshack's first five overs were all maidens. Crapp then hit Toshack to Sid Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs.\nHalfway through the day, England fell to 5/119, and captain Yardley came in. He hit Toshack in the air, but Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg. However, this error did not cost many runs. Yardley lofted Toshack into the on-side and the hands of Johnson at forward square leg to fall for 22 with the score at 6/141. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6. Toshack bowled Dick Pollard late in the innings to finish with 2/75 from 41 overs—including 20 maidens—as England ended with 363. Toshack was unbeaten on zero and was only at the crease for one minute as Australia replied with 221. In the second innings, Toshack removed Compton for a duck, caught in the slips by Miller, and ended with 1/26 as the rain-affected match ended in a draw. He also had Washbrook dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson, one of several times that the batsman was reprieved during the innings.\nAfter bowling 53 overs in the Third Test, Toshack was rested for the match against Middlesex. It was the only tour match before the Fourth Test, and Australia won by ten wickets.\nFourth Test.\nToshack's knee injury flared again in the Fourth Test at Headingley after England elected to bat. On the first morning, England opener Len Hutton edged Toshack through the slips and was then dropped on 25. Hutton eventually reached 81 as the opening pair put on 168. Toshack was wicketless as the hosts closed the first day at 2/268. The following morning, he was removed from the attack after night-watchman Bedser hit him for three consecutive fours. After the lunch break, Toshack bowled Jack Crapp with an inside-edged half volley for five to leave England at 5/447. Toshack ended with an ineffective 1/112 from 35 overs as England made 496. He was the most expensive and uneconomical of the frontline bowlers and it was his most uneconomical performance in the Tests. He aggravated his knee injury and was later taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his bowling duties for the match and his Test career.\nLate on the third day, Toshack was part of a rearguard Australian action that minimised England's first innings lead. He came to the crease at 9/403 to accompany Lindwall, featuring in a 55-run stand and lasting the final 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston running for him. Australia were 9/457 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get Toshack on strike. Despite Toshack and Johnston's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so that he faced most of the balls. On the next morning of play, Toshack did not add to his score before Lindwall was dismissed and Australia ended at 458 in the third over of the day, leaving the tourists 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Toshack did not bowl in the second innings as England made 8/365 and set Australia a target of 404 for victory on the last day. Australia achieved the runs with seven wickets in hand, setting a new world record for the highest successful run-chase in Tests.\nAfter the injury at Headingley, Toshack was out of action for two weeks, missing the matches against Derbyshire, Glamorgan and Warwickshire. These fixtures ended in an innings victory, a rain-affected draw and a nine-wicket win respectively. He returned against Lancashire and scored two in Australia's 321. He then bowled seven overs in the first innings, taking 0/17. He aggravated his injury and did not bowl in the second innings and did not play again for the tour. As a result, Toshack missed the last Test and eight further tour matches, three of which were not first-class. Australia won the Fifth Test by an innings in Toshack's absence to win the series 4–0, and proceeded through the remaining tour matches undefeated.\nRole.\nA left-arm medium-pace seamer, Toshack was a member of Bradman's first-choice team and he played in the first four Tests before being struck down by a persistent knee injury. Toshack contained the English batsmen using leg theory in between the new ball bursts of Miller and Lindwall, usually bowling second change after Miller, Lindwall and Johnston. The English press decried Toshack's style of bowling as negative, but Jack Fingleton said that \"he is generally so close to the stumps that nearly every ball has to be played\".\nDuring the Tests, Toshack took 11 wickets at 33.09; his most notable performance was his 5/40 in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's. Of the four frontline pacemen, Toshack had the second best economy rate, although with his leg stump bowling, he also had a strike rate of 94.45, while the other three fast bowlers all had strike rates below 70. It was a similar tale in the first-class statistics, with the second best economy among the seven frontline bowlers, but the worst strike rate. For the entire tour, Toshack took 50 wickets at 21.12 with four five-wicket innings hauls, including a best of 7/81 against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane. He also took 6/51 in the first innings of the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club, which was almost entirely represented by English Test cricketers. Toshack took two catches on tour, none of them in the Tests.\nAn inept batsman with an average of 5.78 in his first-class career, Toshack managed a Test average of 51.00 on the 1948 tour after being dismissed only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in a freewheeling tenth-wicket stand with Johnston.\nDuring the tour, Toshack had few opportunities with the bat, invariably being placed at either No. 10 and No. 11 in the order alongside Johnston, another tailender with little batting ability.N- Neither player ever passed 30 in their career, and they were the only two players who failed to make a half-century during the tour. As Australia's other specialist bowlers were Lindwall, McCool, Johnson and Doug Ring, all of whom made centuries and more than 18 fifties each during their first-class career, Toshack and Johnston were invariably rooted at the bottom of the order. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings many times due to their batting strength, Toshack only had 12 innings in his 15 first-class fixtures, never batted in the second innings, and scored 78 runs at 8.66. Of the 78 runs, 51 came from four Test innings in Toshack's four Tests.\nDue to the fragility of his knee, Toshack was used sparingly in the tour games, playing in only 11 of the 29 non-Test matches on the tour, the least of any player. Toshack was unable to play in the last nine matches of the tour, having injured himself in the second match against Lancashire.\nNotes.\nStatistical note.\nn-[1]\nThis statement can be verified by consulting all of the scorecards for the matches, as listed here."

        "text": "Although the Super Bowl is consistently one of the most watched television programs in the United States annually, broadcasters have sometimes attempted to intentionally counterprogram against it by running new programming against the game as an alternative, such as special episodes of existing series, one-off special presentations, and previews of new series, typically during its halftime break.\nThe most prominent success of the concept came in 1992, when Fox broadcast a special, live edition of its sketch comedy program \"In Living Color\" during halftime at Super Bowl XXVI, taking advantage of the then-unpopular format of Super Bowl halftime shows. The special drew 22 million viewers, prompting the NFL to book more prominent pop music acts to perform at future Super Bowl halftime shows to compete.\nMost broadcasters would typically air reruns of existing programming or sometimes as marathons, prior to and during the game; in recent years, as all four major networks broadcast NFL games to an extent (all of them alternate airing the game yearly) the networks not airing the Super Bowl rarely broadcast new programming against it in an effort to protect the game's viewership as a sign of respect, to the point that the broadcast rights to Super Bowl LV and LVI were swapped to prevent a CBS-broadcast Super Bowl LVI from competing with the 2022 Winter Olympics on NBC. Some cable channels and digital platforms still attempt to air original programming intended as an alternative to halftime or the game itself (such as Animal Planet's annual \"Puppy Bowl\" special).\nHistory.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the majority of Super Bowl halftime shows were themed, musical spectacles that often featured marching bands and performance ensembles such as Up with People (who performed in four Super Bowl halftime shows between 1976 and 1986 and performed at the pre-game show of Super Bowl XXV in 1991). The group's halftime shows were described as being \"wholesome\" and \"inoffensive\" by critics, but were frequently derided for being dated and out of touch with modern popular culture.\nSuper Bowl counterprogramming was first popularized by Fox. As an alternative, the then-fledgling Fox network aired a special live episode of its popular sketch comedy show \"In Living Color\" during halftime at Super Bowl XXVI (which featured a halftime show entitled \"Winter Magic\", a Winter Olympics-themed show starring Gloria Estefan, Brian Boitano, and Dorothy Hamill to tie into CBS's upcoming broadcast of the Games). The live episode featured football-themed sketches (such as \"Men on Football\"), a performance by Color Me Badd, and a clock counting down to the start of the third quarter. The episode was sponsored by Frito-Lay, who paid $2 million to hold all national advertising time, and to help budget and promote the special; the effort included a $1 million giveaway, whose winner was announced during the broadcast. A CBS executive felt that the concept was \"cute\", but dismissed concerns that the ambush would have any major impact on the viewership of the Super Bowl. The special drew more than 25 million viewers away from the Super Bowl; Nielsen estimated that CBS lost 10 ratings points and more than a fifth of its total viewership during halftime as a result of the special.\nThe unexpected success of the \"In Living Color\" special prompted the NFL to heighten the halftime show's profile to help retain viewership; beginning at Super Bowl XXVII in 1993, the NFL began to invite major pop music performers to perform during the halftime show. The first of these, featuring Michael Jackson, led to a dramatic increase in viewership between halvesthe first in the game's history. Later that year, Fox acquired rights to the NFL's National Football Conference (NFC), replacing CBS, beginning in the 1994 season. The acquisition was a notable coup which helped to establish Fox's position as a major network in its own right, and made Fox one of the major cycling American broadcasters of the Super Bowl itself - and so far the only non-Big Three U.S. media group to hold NFL broadcast rights.\nThe NFL has continued to stay true to its goal of ensuring that the halftime show is as much of a spectacle as the game itself, which has complimented the absolute dominance of the Super Bowl in annual U.S. television viewership since it started holding the overall top ratings spot in 1999. Besides a string of halftime shows from 2005 to 2010 that featured veteran rock acts in the wake of the Super Bowl XXXVIII \"wardrobe malfunction\", the practice of inviting pop acts to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show has continued. The Super Bowl LVII halftime show featuring Rihanna was seen by more than 121 million viewers, as part of an overall telecast that was the most-watched television broadcast in American history.\nAs all four major U.S. television networks currently have ties to the NFL and alternate airing the Super Bowl yearly, Phil Rosenthal of the \"Chicago Tribune\" believed that there was now \"zero likelihood some broadcast network is going to launch a broadside against the NFL's showcase.\", while a \"GQ\" writer argued that the practice was now obsolete, due to the larger number of media options that have emerged since. As such, the networks not airing the game will typically air reruns of existing programs. Fox provided an exception in 2010, when it aired new episodes of \"'Til Death\" during the game; Fox had been burning off the fourth season of the low-rated sitcom in unconventional time slots (such as having aired a marathon of four new episodes on Christmas Day), so its distributor would have enough episodes for syndication. The league's cable channel NFL Network also suspends programming during the game, instead airing a live scoreboard and a simulcast of the game's radio broadcast under the title \"Super Bowl Game Center\".\nCounterprogramming efforts are not limited to television; for Super Bowl XLV in 2011, WCHK-FM, a station in the Green Bay, Wisconsin area announced it would counterprogram the game with dead air, since the hometown Packers were in the game. However, its goal was not to attract listeners from the game, but to do the opposite. The freeform program \"Anything Anything with Rich Russo\" has counterprogrammed the Super Bowl with Dr. Demento.\nCounterprogramming has also expanded to the internet; Jewish radio personality Nachum Segal has organized an annual \"Kosher Halftime Show\" for streaming via his Nachum Segal Network, featuring performances by Jewish musicians. The special was recorded in Atlanta for 2019, marking the first time it was held in the Super Bowl's host city. In 2015, YouTube streamed an alternative, online halftime show featuring notable personalities from the video sharing service. In 2019, the \"Super Smash Bros.\" video game tournament Genesis 6 had top-8 rounds overlapping with Super Bowl LIII, which \"Shacknews\" noted were either \"intentional or completely by accident\".\nFor the first time in the history of the game, Super Bowl LVI in 2022 fell during an ongoing Winter Olympics, the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. In order to prevent the possibility that NBC would have to counterprogram CBS's telecast of the game with primetime coverage of these Olympics (which would dilute viewership and advertising sales), NBC agreed to swap 2021's Super Bowl LV to CBS in favor of Super Bowl LVI—thus giving NBC rights to both the 2022 Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LVI. NBC thus suspended its coverage of the Olympics in favor of pre-game coverage for the Super Bowl, before resuming with primetime coverage as its lead-out. CBS, its sister premium channel Showtime, and HBO, did air new episodes of \"Celebrity Big Brother\" (which averages five episodes per-week), \"Billions\", and \"Euphoria\" respectively on the night of the game; HBO announced that \"Euphoria\" had achieved a series high of 5.1 million viewers, although this included viewership across both HBO and its on-demand streaming platform HBO Max.\nList of notable Super Bowl halftime counterprograms.\nIn regards to original programming, recurring Super Bowl counters have included Animal Planet's annual \"Puppy Bowl\", a special featuring dogs at play in a model football stadium (which itself spawned imitators—the \"Kitten Bowl\" and \"Fish Bowl\", in 2014), and the \"Lingerie Bowl\", a series of pay-per-view broadcasts of all-female football games played in lingerieproving popular enough to be expanded into its own Lingerie Football League with the Lingerie Bowl as its championship game. The LFL was later re-launched as a conventional women's football league, the Legends Football League, and moved its season to run during the NFL off-season instead.\nDuring the 1990s, MTV was a recurring provider of counterprogramming, having scheduled new episodes of \"Beavis and Butt-head\" against the halftime show on multiple occasions. In 1998, MTV aired a pilot episode for a new stop-motion animated series, \"Celebrity Deathmatch\". In the spirit of the Super Bowl airings, its official premiere in May 1998 was scheduled to air on the same night as the series finale of \"Seinfeld\".\nOn several occasions, the professional wrestling promotion WWF (now WWE) broadcast special halftime editions of its Sunday-night program on USA Network at the time, \"Sunday Night Heat\", dubbed \"Halftime Heat\". The concept was revived for Super Bowl LIII by WWE's NXT brand as a streaming special on WWE Network and other platforms, featuring the premiere of a 6-man tag-team match at halftime, as well as a marathon of classic NXT matches.\nOn the day of the Super Bowl, cable channels often air special, and sometimes themed marathons of existing programming prior to and/or during the game, such as Cartoon Network having aired a marathon of \"2 Stupid Dogs\" that it dubbed the \"Stupid Bowl\", DIY Network broadcasting a marathon of bathroom-related programming known as the \"Toilet Bowl\", a \"Poppy Bowl\" marathon of \"Dr. Pimple Popper\" on TLC that additionally featured behind-the-scenes content and updates on featured patients, and during Super Bowl XLV, Canadian network Global airing a marathon of \"Glee,\" and \"Glee\"-themed episodes of \"The Simpsons\" and \"The Office\" (\"Elementary School Musical\" and \"Viewing Party\") as a lead-in for \"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\" after the game (competing network CTV is the Canadian rightsholder of the NFL and Super Bowl, but not \"Glee\")."

He played club rugby for Cardiff and Newport and county rugby for Monmouthshire.\nRugby career.\nWatkins played rugby from a young age, and represented several youth and school teams from the Newport area, including Cwmcarn Youth, Gwent Schools and South Monmouthshire Schools. After spending two seasons with Crumlin, Watkins moved to first class team Cardiff. Two years after joining Cardiff, Watkins gained his first Welsh trial in 1977. In 1978, Watkins was selected for the Welsh tour of Australia, though he was not chosen for either of the two tests. Watkins was selected for the Wales B team several times during the 1970s, but did not gain his first full cap until 1984 when he had switched club to Newport.\nWatkins gained his first international cap in a match against Ireland as part of the 1984 Five Nations Championship. Watkins did not only represent his country he was also given the captaincy, making him only the fourth Welsh player to be given the captain's role on his debut. The Welsh and Watkins were victorious, beating the Irish 18-9 at Lansdowne Road. Watkins played a further three games for Wales, all as captain. His final game was against the touring Australian team in 1984 at the Cardiff Arms Park. Watkins resigned from international rugby in 1984, along with past Welsh captains, Eddie Butler and Gareth Davies. Mike currently lives in Bangkok and has released an autobiography entitled 'Spikey, 2 Hard to Handle'."

        "text": "Mount Field was a cricket ground located at Ospringe on the south-western edge of Faversham in the English county of Kent. It was associated with The Mount, a large house built west of the ground, and was used for one first-class cricket match in 1876.\nCricketing history.\nThe ground was used to host one first-class match in 1876. Kent County Cricket Club lost to Hampshire County Cricket Club by an innings and six runs in August in a fixture which immediately followed the club's Canterbury Cricket Week festival. It was used by Faversham Cricket Club in the 19th century, but only one other scorecard of a match is known to exist, an 1864 fixture between the Gentlemen of Kent and the Gentlemen of Sussex, and was the home ground used by the cricket team from the local gunpowder works in the 1920s.\nThe ground was located between the main A2 London Road and the main London, Chatham and Dover railway line just to the east of Ospringe and west of Faversham railway station. Most of the ground is now built over, with a residential road called Mount Field occupying the area of the ground. A small strip of the ground remains as part of the King George V playing field.\nThe Mount.\nThe Mount is a large 18th-century house which is situated in the south-western corner of the remaining playing field at the eastern edge of Ospringe. It was described as one of \"a number of elegant seats\" along the road east of Ospringe in 1837, at which point it was occupied by Lieutenant-general Gerard Gosselin, a Deputy Lieutenant of Kent and a magistrate, and known as Mount Ospringe. Gosselin had joined the Marine Forces in 1780 and transferred to the Army later in his career. He served in the Napoleonic Wars and was appointed Commandant of the Republic of Genoa after he commanded a Brigade during its capture in April 1814. Later in the year he commanded a Brigade at the in Maine during the War of 1812 and then commanded British forces at Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nGosselin died in 1859 and by 1866 the house was occupied by Percy Beale Neame, a hop farmer who, in 1864, had become a partner in the Faversham brewing business which became known as Shepherd Neame. Neame and his wife Florence, lived at the house until his death at the age of 76 in 1913 and all ten of his children were born there. On his death the estate, including the business, of which he was the sole owner, as well as the house was worth £240,000.\nFlorence remarried in 1915 and the house, which was empty, was used as a Voluntary Aid Detachment hospital during World War I. After the war it was used as a home for refugee children from Serbia and in 1921 it became a National Children's Home property, closing in the 1930s. The building, which is a Grade II listed building, was later used as an office by the Ministry of National Insurance and by the Kent Agricultural Emergency Committee. It is now divided into residential flats."

He was an assistant coach of the Boston Celtics, and was the first modern-era commissioner of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nBiography.\nA native of Everett, Massachusetts, Silva attended Muhlenberg College and served in World War I. Returning home from war, Silva pursued a career in professional baseball. He appeared in a single game at the major league level for the 1919 Washington Senators. On August 11 of that season, he played third base for the Senators at Griffith Stadium. The Senators' lineup that day featured Baseball Hall of Fame outfielder Sam Rice, and saw the team's Hall of Fame hurler Walter Johnson used as a late-inning pinch hitter. Silva had one hit in four at-bats, a single that came as part of Washington's three-run ninth inning rally. The Senators lost the game, 7–4, to the Chicago White Sox and Shoeless Joe Jackson, a team that would become notorious for the Black Sox Scandal that marred the season's World Series.\nSilva split time in 1920 between the Albany Senators and Springfield Ponies of the Eastern League. He returned to Springfield in 1921, and played his final professional season in 1922 with Springfield and the Pittsfield Hillies.\nSilva was a player-manager in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) from 1927 to 1932. He played for and managed Wareham in 1927, Osterville from 1928 to 1930, where he led the team to the 1928 league title, and Barnstable in 1931 and 1932. He became a longtime umpire in the CCBL, and was described as \"a jocular soul behind the plate when he is umpiring. He moans out strikes and balls in a sort of hog-caller's bass with all appropriate trimmings.\" In the early 1960s when a knowledgeable and universally respected figure was needed to unify the newly-reorganized CCBL, Silva was chosen and served as the first commissioner of the league's modern era, a position he held from 1962 to 1968. Silva was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class of 2000.\nSilva taught physical education and coached in the Everett school system for 24 years, taking a hiatus during World War II to serve as a major in the United States Air Force. From 1946 to 1948, he was assistant coach of the Boston Celtics under head coach Honey Russell.\nSilva died in Hyannis, Massachusetts in 1974 at age 77."

The top three seeds in each conference were awarded to the division winners; while the five remaining spots were awarded to the highest finishers in their respective conferences.\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference was matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage, which gave them a possible maximum of four games on their home ice, with the lower-seeded team getting a possible maximum of three. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice is determined based on regular season points. Each best-of-seven series followed a 2–2–1–1–1 format. This meant that the higher-seeded team had home ice for games one and two, and if necessary, five and seven, while the lower-seeded team had home ice for games three, four and, if necessary, six.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nConference quarterfinals.\nEastern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Boston Bruins vs. (8) Montreal Canadiens.\nFor an NHL-record 32nd time, the Bruins and Canadiens faced each other in the playoffs. The Boston Bruins entered the playoffs after finishing the regular season with the best record in the Eastern Conference with 116 points. The Montreal Canadiens qualified for the postseason as the eighth seed with 93 points, winning the tiebreaker over the Florida Panthers based on the season series (six points to three).\nBoston swept Montreal, four games to none, scoring at least four goals in each win. With the score tied 2–2 entering the third period of game one, Bruins captain Zdeno Chara scored a power play goal at 11:15 and Phil Kessel added an empty net score in the closing seconds to clinch the victory. Boston scored three power play goals, including two from Marc Savard, en route to a 5–1 victory in game two. Game three resembled game one in that both teams fought to a 2–2 tie midway through the game, but like the first contest the Bruins scored the go-ahead winning goal again. This time it was Michael Ryder at 17:21 in the second period. Montreal scored in the first minute of game four off the stick of Andrei Kostitsyn, but Boston went on to dominate the rest of the game, grabbing two goals from Ryder in a 4–1 victory, to win the series.\n(2) Washington Capitals vs. (7) New York Rangers.\nThe Washington Capitals entered the playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference after winning the Southeast Division with 108 points. The New York Rangers earned the seventh seed with 95 points. The teams met in the playoffs four times previously, with each winning two series. They last met in the 1994 Eastern Conference semifinals, which the Rangers won in five games.\nThe Capitals overcame a three games to one deficit to win the series. The Rangers won the first game by a 4–3 score, with Brandon Dubinsky scoring the game winner at 11:43 in the third period. Capitals head coach Bruce Boudreau benched starting goaltender Jose Theodore and replaced him with Semyon Varlamov for game two, after Theodore allowed four goals on just 21 shots. The goaltending change was not immediately effective as New York netminder Henrik Lundqvist stopped all 35 Washington shots to give the Rangers a 1–0 victory (with Ryan Callahan providing the only tally) in the following game. Varlamov responded in game three by stopping all 33 Ranger shots, and Alexander Semin scored two goals, to lead the Capitals to a 4–0 victory. However, Lundqvist stopped 38 of 39 shots, including 10 of 11 from the stick of Alexander Ovechkin, to give the Rangers a 2–1 victory in game four. The Capitals limited the Rangers to just 20 shots to win 4–0 in Game five. Fourth liner Matt Bradley scored two goals in the game and Lundquist was pulled after allowing four goals on 14 shots. Washington erupted in game six to score five goals, including powerplay markers from Mike Green and Ovechkin, for a 5–3 victory. After game six, the league suspended Capitals forward Donald Brashear for both a pre-game altercation with Rangers forward Colton Orr and what was ruled to be a late hit on Blair Betts, in which the Rangers center suffered an orbital eye socket fracture. Sergei Fedorov scored the game-winning goal 15:01 into the third period in game seven to give the Capitals a 2–1 victory and eliminate the Rangers for their first playoff series victory since reaching the Stanley Cup Finals in 1998.\n(3) New Jersey Devils vs. (6) Carolina Hurricanes.\nThe New Jersey Devils entered the playoffs as the third seed in the Eastern Conference after winning the Atlantic Division with 106 points. The Carolina Hurricanes earned the sixth seed with 97 points. These teams met three times previously in the playoffs, with the Hurricanes winning two series. They last met in the 2006 Eastern Conference semifinals, with the Hurricanes winning in five games.\nThe Hurricanes defeated the Devils in seven games. New Jersey won the first game with goaltender Martin Brodeur stopping 18 of 19 shots and the Devils' top line playing phenomenally, with Zach Parise and Patrik Elias coming up with goals. . In game two, Tim Gleason scored 2:40 into overtime for his first goal of the season to give Carolina a 2–1 victory. The game was a goaltending battle that saw Brodeur and Cam Ward each stop over 30 shots Game 3 also went into overtime, but this time the Devils prevailed, 3–2, with Travis Zajac scoring at 4:48 into the extra period. It appeared that game four would also go into overtime, but it ended with an epic conclusion. Carolina led 3–0, but New Jersey rallied to tie the game in the third. Jussi Jokinen proved to be the hero, as he scored on a deflection with 0.2 seconds remaining in regulation to give the Hurricanes a 4–3 victory. This goal was the latest game winning regulation goal in Stanley Cup Playoff history. The next two games of the series were shutouts: Brodeur stopped 44 shots in a 1–0 victory for the Devils in game five (with David Clarkson providing the game's sole goal), while Cam Ward stopped 28 shots and Eric Staal scored twice in a 4–0 victory for Carolina in game six. The Hurricanes were behind for much of game seven but scored two goals inside the last 1:20 of the third period, one by Jokinen and the other by Staal, to win the contest 4–3 and eliminate the Devils.\n(4) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (5) Philadelphia Flyers.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers qualified for the playoffs by finishing the regular season tied with 99 points, but the Penguins earned the fourth seed because they won the tiebreaker on total wins (45–44) while the Flyers got the fifth seed. The Penguins and Flyers had previously met in the previous season's Eastern Conference Final, with the Penguins winning in five games. It was the Penguins first win against the Flyers, having lost against them in three previous series (1989, 1997 and 2000).\nThe Penguins defeated the Flyers in six games. Sidney Crosby scored a power play goal early in the first period of game one, sparking the Penguins to a 4–1 win against an undisciplined Flyers team that took 12 penalties. In game two, Bill Guerin scored two goals including the game-winner during a five-on-three power play at 18:29 in overtime to give Pittsburgh a 3–2 victory. The Flyers bounced back in game three with a 6–3 victory that featured two goals by Simon Gagne. Pittsburgh goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 45 shots and helped kill off nine Philadelphia power plays, while Tyler Kennedy scored the game winner, to give Pittsburgh a 3–1 win in Game 4. Flyers goaltender Martin Biron stopped all 28 shots, and Philadelphia got scoring from unlikely sources such as Arron Asham, to give the Flyers a 3–0 victory in game five. Then in game six, Philadelphia jumped to a 3–0 lead in the second period and appeared to be on their way to force a game seven. However, a fight between Philadelphia's Daniel Carcillo and Pittsburgh's Max Talbot reenergized the Penguins, who erupted to score five unanswered goals, including two by Crosby, to win the game and the series.\nWestern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) San Jose Sharks vs. (8) Anaheim Ducks.\nThe series between the Sharks and Ducks was just the second time in NHL history that two California teams were facing each other in the playoffs. The first series was in 1969 between the Los Angeles Kings and the Oakland Seals. The San Jose Sharks entered the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winner, earning the NHL's best regular season record with 117 points. The Anaheim Ducks earned 91 points to clinch the eighth playoff seed in the Western Conference.\nThe Ducks defeated the Sharks in six games, to become just the second California team (after the 2000 Sharks over the St. Louis Blues) to eliminate a Presidents' Trophy winner in the first round of the playoffs. Anaheim goaltender Jonas Hiller earned two shutout victories in games one and four, stopping a total of 66 shots. Game one was deadlocked until a Scott Niedermayer powerplay goal broke the ice at 5:18 in the third, while game four was dominated by Anaheim and featured two goals from Bobby Ryan Hiller also stopped 42 out of 44 shots in game two, as Drew Miller picked up the game winner, and 36 out of 37 shots in a game six that saw the Ducks produce powerplay goals from Corey Perry and Teemu Selanne. In total, Hiller allowed only ten goals in the series. For the Sharks, Dan Boyle scored two goals in game three to give San Jose a 4–3 win in that contest, while Patrick Marleau scored the game-winning goal in game five to give the Sharks a 3–2 overtime victory. However, back in Anaheim for game six, the Ducks grabbed goals from big-name players like Selanne and Perry, dominating the Sharks to win the game 4–1, and eliminating the Sharks.\n(2) Detroit Red Wings vs. (7) Columbus Blue Jackets.\nThe Detroit Red Wings, the defending Stanley Cup Champions, entered the playoffs as the second overall seed in the Western Conference, having clinched the Central Division title with 112 points. The Columbus Blue Jackets qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, clinching the seventh seed with 92 points but lost the head-to-head tiebreaker with the St. Louis Blues. This was the first Western Conference playoff series played entirely within the Eastern Time Zone since the Red Wings played the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1993 Norris Division semifinals, and this proved to be the last ever occurrence, as both of these teams were realigned into the Eastern Conference prior to the start of the 2013–14 season.\nThe Red Wings swept the Blue Jackets in four games. Detroit scored four goals in each of the first three games of the series, while goaltender Chris Osgood only allowed two total goals out of 78 Columbus shots in those three games, including a shutout victory in game two. Jiri Hudler broke the ice at 10:48 in the second period for the game one win. Detroit picked up powerplay goals from Brian Rafalski, Niklas Kronwall, and Hudler in game two. Henrik Zetterberg scored twice in a game three victory\nThe fourth game proved to be the most competitive contest of the series. Nicklas Lidstrom scored a power play goal early in the first period to give the Red Wings the lead before Kristian Huselius tied the score about three minutes later on a power play goal of his own. Tomas Holmstrom and Dan Cleary then scored to give Detroit a 3–1 lead before the end of the opening period. Columbus fought to tie the score again at 5:38 of the second period with goals by Rick Nash and R. J. Umberger, but the Red Wings Marian Hossa answered with two consecutive goals to give his team a two-goal lead again. The Blue Jackets then rallied to tie the score, 5–5, by the closing minutes of the second period with scores by Kris Russell and Fredrik Modin. The third period remained scoreless until the closing minutes of regulation. With less than two minutes left, the Blue Jackets were called for too many men on the ice, which enabled Johan Franzen to score the series winning power play goal with 46.6 seconds remaining.\n(3) Vancouver Canucks vs. (6) St. Louis Blues.\nThe Vancouver Canucks entered the playoffs as the third overall seed in the Western Conference, having clinched the Northwest Division title with 100 points. The St. Louis Blues qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2004, clinching the sixth seed with 92 points and winning the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Columbus Blue Jackets. This was the third meeting in the playoffs for these two teams, the Canucks winning both previous series. They last met in the 2003 Western Conference quarterfinals, with the Canucks winning in seven games.\nVancouver swept St. Louis in four games, their first sweep of a best-of-seven series in franchise history, to move on to the second round. The Canucks held off the Blues in game one, winning 2–1 by gaining goals from Daniel Sedin and Sami Salo and killing off a long Blues five-on-three power play midway through the first period. Vancouver then shut out St. Louis in game two, 3–0, with goaltender Roberto Luongo stopping all 30 Blues shots and Mats Sundin providing the game-winning goal. The Blues were hoping to gain momentum when the series shifted to St. Louis for game three, but Vancouver held on to a 3–2 win, scoring three power play goals, with Mattias Ohlund, Sedin, and Steve Bernier providing the man-advantage tallies. In game four, Brad Boyes and David Perron helped St. Louis to tie the game after falling behind early. However, Alexandre Burrows scored with 18.9 seconds left in the first overtime period to give the Canucks a 3–2 victory and the four-game sweep.\n(4) Chicago Blackhawks vs. (5) Calgary Flames.\nThe Chicago Blackhawks finished the regular season in second place in the Central division with 104 points and thus entered the playoffs as the fourth-overall seed in the Western Conference. The Calgary Flames earned 98 points during the regular season to finish fifth-overall in the Western Conference. Chicago made the playoffs for the first time since 2002. The two teams met in the playoffs three times previously, with the Flames winning two series. They last met in the 1996 Western Conference quarterfinals, with the Blackhawks winning in four games.\nChicago won the series over Calgary in six games, with the home team winning the first five games of the series. Martin Havlat scored the game-winning goal 12 seconds into overtime to win game one for the Blackhawks, 3–2. Then in game two, Chicago overcame a 2-goal deficit by scoring 3 goals in the second period, including a pair from Jonathan Toews, to win 3–2. When the series shifted to Calgary for game three, David Moss scored two goals to help the Flames earn a 4–2 victory. In game four, Calgary scored six goals, including two by each of their top stars Jarome Iginla and Olli Jokinen, to win 6–4. The Blackhawks responded in game five by exploding to a 5–1 victory, going up 3–0 after one period with goals from Brent Seabrook, Patrick Sharp, and Kris Versteeg, and limiting the Flames to 20 shots on goal. Chicago defeated Calgary by a score of 4–1 in game six to win the series, with Patrick Kane providing the early game winner and goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin stopping 43 out of 44 shots.\nConference semifinals.\nFor the first time since the 2001 playoffs, at least three Conference Semifinal series extended to seven games.\nEastern Conference semifinals.\n(1) Boston Bruins vs. (6) Carolina Hurricanes.\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bruins winning all three previous series. They last met in the 1999 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which Boston won in six games. The Carolina Hurricanes eliminated the Boston Bruins in seven games to advance to their first Eastern Conference Final since their Stanley Cup championship season in 2006. Marc Savard scored two goals to help give the Bruins a 4–1 victory in game one, but the Hurricanes won the next three games of the series. First, Carolina goaltender Cam Ward stopped all 36 shots and Matt Cullen provided a shorthanded marker in a 3–0 victory in game two. Next, Jussi Jokinen scored at 2:48 into overtime of game three to give the Hurricanes a 3–2 victory. In game four, Eric Staal scored two goals and Ward stopped 18 out of only 19 shots en route to a 4–1 victory. However, Phil Kessel scored two goals and goaltender Tim Thomas stopped all 19 shots to give Boston a 4–0 victory in game five. Thomas then stopped 31 out of 33 shots and Mark Recchi provided an early game winner to help the Bruins win 4–2 in game six. The Hurricanes led game seven after two periods, but Milan Lucic tied the game at 6:19 in the third. However, Scott Walker scored the game-winning goal at 18:46 into the first overtime period to give the Hurricanes a 3–2 victory and the series.\n(2) Washington Capitals vs. (4) Pittsburgh Penguins.\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Penguins winning six of the previous seven series. They last met in the 2001 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, with the Penguins winning in seven games. The Pittsburgh Penguins advanced to their second consecutive Eastern Conference Final after defeating the Washington Capitals, 6–2, in game seven of their Conference Semifinal series. The Capitals appeared to have control of the series after winning the first two games. In game one, Washington goaltender Semyon Varlamov came up with a career-high 34 saves and Tomas Fleischmann provided a decisive third period goal in a 3–2 victory. Then in game two, both the Penguins' Sidney Crosby and the Capitals' Alexander Ovechkin each earned hat tricks, but David Steckel's goal in the second period ultimately made the difference in Washington's 4–3 win. However, Pittsburgh went on to win three consecutive games. Late in the third period of game three, Evgeni Malkin appeared to have the game winning powerplay marker for the Penguins, but Nicklas Backstrom tied the game on a Washington powerplay at 18:10. Kris Letang's game-winning goal at 11:23 into overtime gave the Penguins a 3–2 win. Pittsburgh then erupted to score three goals in the first period of game four, coming from the sticks of Sergei Gonchar, Bill Guerin, and Ruslan Fedotenko, en route to a 5–3 victory. The Penguins also had another overtime victory in game five, with Evgeni Malkin scoring this time on a power play at 3:28 into the extra period for a 4–3 win. The Capitals rebounded in game six with an overtime victory of their own, as David Steckel scored at 6:22 into the extra period to give Washington a 5–4 win.\nIn the deciding seventh game of the series, Varlamov, who had posted a 2.21 GAA and two shutouts in the playoffs, was pulled in the second period as the Penguins took a 4–0 lead only 2:13 into the second period. At the time that Varlamov was replaced by Jose Theodore, Pittsburgh had outshot Washington 18–5. The Penguins won 6–2 in dominating fashion, picking up a pair of goals from Crosby, to close out the series.\nCrosby finished the series with thirteen points—one fewer than Ovechkin's fourteen points, which was the highest single-series point total since the 1995 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nWestern Conference semifinals.\n(2) Detroit Red Wings vs. (8) Anaheim Ducks.\nThe Detroit Red Wings advanced to their third consecutive Western Conference Final, and eighth since 1995, after eliminating the Anaheim Ducks in seven games. This Conference Semifinal match up featured the last two winners of the Stanley Cup, with Anaheim and Detroit winning the Cup in 2007 and 2008 respectively. This also marked the fifth series the two teams faced each other in since their first encounter in 1997. Both teams had won two series' each with the Wings winning in 1997 and 1999, and the Ducks winning in 2003 and 2007.\nIn game one, Nicklas Lidstrom scored two goals, including the game-winner with about 49 seconds left in regulation to break a 2–2 tie to give the Red Wings the victory. Anaheim's Todd Marchant scored at 1:15 into triple overtime of game two to give the Ducks a 4–3 victory, after goaltender Jonas Hiller stopped 59 Red Wing shots. Game three then ended in controversy: Anaheim was nursing a 2–1 lead with 1:04 remaining in the third period, aided by Hiller's eventual 45 saves and goals from Teemu Selanne and Scott Neidermayer. Detroit's Marian Hossa appeared to have scored the game-tying goal, but referee Brad Watson blew the play dead after losing sight of the puck and the Ducks held on to win the game. Despite the controversial call, the Red Wings bounced back to even the series in game four, with Hossa and Johan Franzen scoring two goals apiece en route to a 6–3 victory. Detroit then went on to win game five, 4–1, with Franzen and Jiri Hudler scoring just 39 seconds apart in the second period to provide the game's first goals. In game six, goaltender Jonas Hiller stopped 38 out of 39 shots as Ryan Getzlaf and Cory Perry each scored to give the Ducks a 2–1 victory. In game seven, Bobby Ryan pulled the Ducks into a 3–3 tie at 7:37 of the third period. However, Red Wings forward Dan Cleary scored the game-winning goal with 3:00 left in regulation after Hiller lost sight of the puck behind him and pushed it over the goal line, to give the Red Wings a 4–3 victory and the series.\n(3) Vancouver Canucks vs. (4) Chicago Blackhawks.\nThe Chicago Blackhawks eliminated the Vancouver Canucks in six games, to advance to the Western Conference Final for the first time since 1995. This was just the third time that these two teams faced each other in the playoffs. In 1982, the Canucks eliminated the Blackhawks in five games in the Campbell Conference final, while the Blackhawks won a 1995 conference semifinals series in a four-game sweep.\nSami Salo scored at 18:47 in the third period of game one to break a 3–3 tie, giving the Canucks an eventual 5–3 win. The Blackhawks bounced back in game two, overcoming a 2–0 deficit in the second period to go on to a 6–3 victory, with Patrick Sharp and Dave Bolland scoring two goals each. Vancouver regained the series lead in game three, with goaltender Roberto Luongo stopping 23 out of 24 shots and Steve Bernier providing a powerplay goal to earn a 3–1 victory. However, Chicago went on to win the next three games to close the series. First, Martin Havlat tied game four at 17:16 in the third period and Andrew Ladd scoring at 2:52 into overtime to give the Blackhawks a 2–1 victory. Dustin Byfuglien then scored two goals en route to a 4–2 Chicago win in game five. Finally, the Blackhawks won a high-scoring game six, 7–5, with Patrick Kane earning a hat trick.\nConference finals.\nEastern Conference final.\n(4) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (6) Carolina Hurricanes.\nThis was the first time these two teams met in the playoffs. The Pittsburgh Penguins swept the Carolina Hurricanes in four games, to advance to their second consecutive Stanley Cup Finals series. Pittsburgh jumped to a 2–0 lead in the first period of game one, with goals by Miroslav Satan and Evgeni Malkin, before Philippe Boucher added a third period power play goal. Marc-Andre Fleury made a sprawling save on an Eric Staal one-timer in the closing seconds to allow the Penguins to hang on for a 3–2 victory. Game two featured offensive assaults by both teams. Patrick Eaves tied the game for Carolina early in the third period, but Malkin responded by scoring two highlight reel markers to complete a hat trick en route to a 7–4 win. In game three, Malkin had two goals and an assist in a 6–2 victory. Carolina outplayed Pittsburgh for much of game four and got off to a hot start when Staal scored on a wrap around move. However, the Penguins scored four unanswered goals, including a Max Talbot tally that ricocheted strangely off of goaltender Cam Ward to let the Penguins take the lead late in the opening frame, as they picked up a 4–1 win.\nWestern Conference final.\n(2) Detroit Red Wings vs. (4) Chicago Blackhawks.\nThis was the 15th meeting between these two teams in the playoffs, with the Blackhawks winning eight of the previous fourteen series. They last met in the 1995 Western Conference Final, with the Red Wings winning in five games. The Detroit Red Wings eliminated the Chicago Blackhawks in five games again, to advance to their second consecutive Stanley Cup Finals series. Three of the five games in the series were decided in overtime. Dan Cleary scored two goals en route to a 5–2 Detroit victory in game one. In game two, Jonathan Toews scored two Chicago goals, including one that tied the game at 12:20 in the third period. However, Mikael Samuelsson scored at 5:14 into overtime to give the Red Wings a 3–2 win. Chicago bounced back in game three with a 4–3 win of Patrick Sharp's overtime goal at 1:52 into the extra period. The Blackhawks took an early 3–0 lead in the game but saw Detroit bounce back with three goals from defencemen in the second period. During the game, Blackhawks goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin was injured and replaced for the third period and overtime by Cristobal Huet. The game also featured a controversial hit from Nicklas Kronwall that injured star Chicago winger Martin Havlat. Detroit dominated game four, winning 6–1, with Marian Hossa and Henrik Zetterberg each tallying a pair of goals. Game five was an exhibition in goaltending with Chris Osgood and Cristobal Huet each making a variety of spectacular saves. However, Darren Helm proved to be the eventual hero, scoring at 3:58 into overtime to give the Red Wings a 2–1 win and the series. This was the last Western Conference Final series to be played entirely outside of California until 2018.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams and a rematch of the previous year's Stanley Cup Finals which Detroit won in six games. This was the first time since 1983 and 1984 that same teams met in consecutive finals. This was Detroit's twenty-fourth Finals appearance; while Pittsburgh made their fourth appearance in the Finals. The teams split their two-game regular season series.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points. If the list exceeds ten skaters because of a tie in points, all of the tied skaters are shown.\nGoaltending.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage with at least 420 minutes played. The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion is bolded.\nTelevision.\nNational Canadian English-language coverage of the playoffs were split between the CBC and TSN, with the CBC holding exclusive rights to the Stanley Cup Finals. French-language telecasts were broadcast on RDS and RDS2. This was the first postseason that the CBC and TSN selected the rights to individual series in the first three rounds using a draft-like setup. The CBC had first, second, fourth, and sixth choices of first-round series; first and third in the second round, and first in the conference finals. TSN then had third, fifth, seventh, and eighth choices of first-round series; second and fourth in the second round; and second in the conference finals. These changes also allowed TSN to broadcast playoff games involving Canadian teams for the first time, removing the CBC's exclusivity on them.\nIn the United States, coverage was split between NBC and Versus. During the first three rounds, NBC primarily televised weekend afternoon games and Versus aired evening games. During the first and second round, excluding games exclusively broadcast on NBC, the regional rights holders of each participating U.S. team produced local telecasts of their respective games. Not all first and second-round games were nationally televised, while the conference finals were exclusively broadcast on either NBC or Versus. NBC then aired the first two and final three games of the Stanley Cup Finals, while Versus broadcast games three and four."

        "text": "The Surfers Paradise Baseball Club is a baseball club based on the Gold Coast in Queensland, that participates in the Greater Brisbane League, Gold Coast and Far North Coast competitions. The club was also host of the 2008 Pan Pacific Masters Games.\nHistory.\nJohn Carpenter, Mitch Wikum and Steve Meeham founded Surfers Paradise Baseball Club in 1987. That year the club entered three teams in the Brisbane metropolitan competition, and in their first season won the A-Grade title. This was achieved through the assistance of ex-Claxton Shield players from other states including: Larry Montgomery (NSW), Gary Coward (SA), Lance Wegner (VIC), as well as other quality players from around the Gold Coast and Brisbane region.\nThe idea for a junior competition on the Gold Coast, or at least Surfers Paradise, was initiated by Steve Meeham who advertised in the local paper for junior players. With mixed responses from players of all age groups, the competition attracted 60 kids between the ages of 10 and 14 years plus one father - Gary Edwards. With Gary's help, Steve split up the children into 5 equal sides, and rolled out a competition on Saturday mornings.\nThe five junior sides - Giants, Dodgers, Dragons, Reds and Sharks – attracted great success in the '88 to '89 season, and by the '89 to '90 season the number of kids playing baseball at Surfers Paradise had doubled. By the start of the '90 to '91 season, there was an abundance of young players with not enough coaches to manage them so the competition was forced to expand and teams were created in the areas where the kids lived such as Runaway Bay, Nerang and Palm Beach.\nThe first junior representative players to come from Surfers Paradise were Brandon Pollard, Trent Durrington, Shane Edwards and Adam Wardrop. All four boys were selected in the QLD U/16's squad in 1990 with each of them progressing to more senior representative teams over the years including National and Junior selection, as well as Australian Senior team selection for Trent and Brandon. Trent now runs a Training With the Pro's program out of the club every year in December.\nOn 21 December 2008 the team played in the Commissioners Cup at the Beenleigh Hawks baseball club and lost to the shield's incumbent, the Redcliffe Padres 4–3."

        "text": "Group A of the 1994 FIFA World Cup was one of six groups of four teams competing at the 1994 World Cup in the United States. The first matches were played June 18, 1994 and the final games took place simultaneously on June 26, 1994.\nThe group consisted of one CONCACAF team, the host United States; two UEFA teams, Switzerland and Romania; and one CONMEBOL team, Colombia. Romania won the group, Switzerland finished second and also the United States advanced to the knockout stage as one of the best third-placed teams. Colombia finished last with only three points.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local time.\nUnited States vs Switzerland.\n&lt;section begin=A1 /&gt;&lt;section end=A1 /&gt;\nColombia vs Romania.\n&lt;section begin=A2 /&gt;&lt;section end=A2 /&gt;\nRomania vs Switzerland.\n&lt;section begin=A3 /&gt;&lt;section end=A3 /&gt;\nNote: Switzerland's fourth goal is also credited to Georges Bregy.\nUnited States vs Colombia.\nThe match between the United States and Colombia saw the United States go ahead with just over 10 minutes to play in the first half, when Colombia defender Andrés Escobar turned a United States cross into his own net. The United States extended their lead early in the second half through Earnie Stewart, while Colombia could only manage a last-minute consolation goal and ended up losing 2–1. The result was the first United States's win in a FIFA World Cup match since the historic United States vs. England in 1950 and meant Colombia's chances of qualifying were no longer in their own hands; they would need to beat Switzerland and hope the United States would beat Romania to stand any chance of qualifying as one of the four best third-placed teams. Escobar was blamed for the result by Colombians and was murdered shortly after returning to the country.\n&lt;section begin=A4 /&gt;&lt;section end=A4 /&gt;\nSwitzerland vs Colombia.\nTo have any hope of finishing in third place and a potential spot in the round of 16, Colombia needed a victory against already-qualified Switzerland, and took the lead through Hernán Gaviria just before half-time. Gaviria was substituted late in the second half, and his replacement, Harold Lozano, doubled Colombia's lead in the last minute of the game. Colombia had managed the win they needed, but they still required the United States to beat Romania in the group's other final game.\n&lt;section begin=A5 /&gt;&lt;section end=A5 /&gt;\nUnited States vs Romania.\nStarting the day in third place, Romania needed a win to guarantee progress to the knockout phase. The United States' qualification was already practically assured, but a win for the host nation would open the door for Colombia to qualify ahead of Romania with victory over Switzerland. That prospect was ended in the 18th minute, when Dan Petrescu scored the only goal of the game for Romania, giving them a 1–0 win. Combined with Switzerland's loss to Colombia, that meant Romania finished top of the group, followed by Switzerland, with the United States in third. The United States ultimately qualified as one of the four best third-placed teams.\n&lt;section begin=A6 /&gt;&lt;section end=A6 /&gt;"

        "title": "Rugby league in South Australia",
        "text": "Rugby league in South Australia describes the sport of Rugby league, which is played at amateur level in the state of South Australia. Rugby League has been played in South Australia since the 1940s. The governing body is NRL South Australia.\nSouth Australia was once home to a professional club, the Adelaide Rams from 1997–1998.\nHistory.\nThe first instance of rugby league being played in South Australia occurred during the 1914 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, when the touring Lions beat South Australia 101–0 at Hawthorn Oval in front of 2,500 spectators.\nCurrent rugby league activity in the state traces its roots in the state back to the 1940s, when the Port Adelaide rugby union team split, and defected to rugby league. The first competition began in 1947 with five clubs. South Sydney played a South Australian team in 1945 beating them 45–10.\nBig time rugby league came to South Australia on 28 June 1991 when the St George Dragons defeated the Balmain Tigers in front of 28,884 fans at the Adelaide Oval for their Round 14 match of the 1991 NSWRL season. This would be the first of five consecutive years the Dragons (sponsored by South Australian wine company Penfolds) would play one home game per season at the Adelaide Oval. The attendance also stood as the NSWRL's largest minor round attendance of the 1991 season.\nSouth Australia's only professional rugby league team, the Adelaide Rams, had a short but eventful existence. Originally the Australian Rugby League (ARL) planned to relocate one of the struggling Sydney teams to Adelaide, but the Super League war and the SARL's decision to align themselves with the News Ltd financed Super League in 1995 killed off the ARL's want for a team in Adelaide, and the ARL turned its attention back to Melbourne instead. Later in 1995, with Super League still only consisting of nine teams and the Victorian Rugby League still aligned with the ARL, a decision was made to give Adelaide the 10th Super League licence.\nIn 1995 the ARL won their Supreme Court battle with Super League which stopped the rebel competition from starting its first season in 1996. This proved only temporary however as the decision was overturned on appeal and Super League would begin their new competition in 1997 with the Adelaide Rams one of the teams to be playing.\nBrought into existence for the 1997 Super League season, the Rams had instant success, attracting 27,435 to their first home game at the Adelaide Oval against fellow newcomers the Hunter Mariners (the Mariners based in Newcastle, NSW). Results however would prove elusive for the new club who finished their inaugural season in 9th place, though they did enjoy some success against stronger clubs, with wins over the Auckland Warriors (away), eventual Grand Finalists Cronulla (away), and the Penrith Panthers in their final home game of the year.\nIn 1998 they were selected to join the 20-team National Rugby League, however rumours abounded that they were to axed from the 1999 season as part of the rationalisation of teams (from 20 to 16) in the competition. Crowd numbers fell away in 1998 as on-field results continued to elude the team, and a dispute over playing at the Adelaide Oval saw the Rams move to Hindmarsh Stadium for the final four rounds of the season. Poor on field results also resulted in inaugural head coach Rod Reddy being sacked halfway through the season and replaced by Dean Lance. The Rams finished what was their final season in 17th place with a 7-17 win–loss record.\nThe club got as far as their season launch for the 1999 NRL season before the club's owners News Ltd agreed to wind up the club before the season started.\nGoverning body.\nThe South Australian Rugby League is responsible for administering the game of rugby league in South Australia. South Australia is an Affiliated State of the overall Australian governing body the Australian Rugby League.\nState competitions.\nThere are five senior clubs and six junior clubs located around Adelaide. Competitions are run from Under 7s through to First Grade.\nRepresentative teams are selected each year to compete in the Australian Secondary Schools Rugby League (ASSRL) National Championships at both 15 and 18 years of age respectively, competing against Western Australia, Victoria, Northern Territory and New South Wales Combined Independent Schools (NSW CIS) at both age levels. Players who compete representing South Australia each year are eligible to be selected into both the Australian Merit Squad and the Australian Affiliated States Merit Squad at the 15 Years championships, and the Australian Schoolboys as well as the Australian Affiliated States team at the 18 Years championships.\nCompetitions.\nAdelaide Rugby League Premiership.\nThe top-level competition in the SARL is also known as NRLSA Metro and is sponsored as the Sportcentre Cup.\nLimestone Coast Rugby League.\nThe Limestone Coast Rugby League is a competition co-administered by NRL SA and NRL Victoria.\nSpencer Gulf &amp; Northern SA.\nNRL SA has previously run competitions in the Spencer Gulf region, but the future of these competitions remains unclear as of 2022.\nThe Olympic Dam Barbarians based in Roxby Downs have played in various formats including intra club and in the Spencer Gulf competition. There have also been efforts to establish the presence of the game in areas including Coober Pedy, however there remains little competitive Rugby League in Northern SA.\nRepresentative Team.\nThe South Australian state team play in the Affiliated States Championship along with the other three affiliated states (Victoria, Northern Territory and Western Australia) plus the Australian Police and Australian Defence Force.\nThe first instance of rugby league being played in South Australia occurred during the 1914 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, when the touring Lions beat South Australia 101-0 at Hawthorn Oval in front of 2,500 spectators.\nIn 1994 and 1995 the then \"West End XIII\" played Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the curtain raiser game for the State of Origin games in those years. In 1994 the South Australian side had the privilege of being one of the first Rugby League sides to play at that venue in nearly 80 years.\nA South Australian representative side has played a number of games against international touring sides, including the Australian team.\nLargest Rugby League Attendances in South Australia.\nThe following are the largest rugby league crowds in South Australia.\nNotable South Australian rugby league players.\nThe following South Australian players have played in the National Rugby League.\nNotes and references.\n\"This article incorporates content from the South Australian Rugby League article.\""

        "title": "2008–09 PBA Tour season",
        "text": "This is a recap of the 2008–09 season for the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour. It was the Tour's 50th season and consisted of 21 events.\nSeason highlights.\nOn October 1, 2008, the PBA began a three-year sponsorship deal with Lumber Liquidators, making the American hardwood flooring retailer the tour's title sponsor through the 2010–11 season. Denny's, the title sponsor from 2005 to 2008, remained a PBA sponsor and continued as the title sponsor of the Denny's Dick Weber Open tour stop.\nThe PBA kicked off its 50th season with a major tournament: the PBA World Championship was moved to the front of the PBA schedule for the first time in history. The tournament was contested October 19–25, 2008 at Northrock Lanes in Wichita, Kansas, with the live televised finals airing Sunday, October 26 on ESPN. The 20-event 2008–09 season concluded with the 66th U.S. Open, March 29 – April 5 in North Brunswick, New Jersey. Other majors in 2008–09 included the H&amp;R Block Tournament of Champions (January 19–26 at Red Rock Lanes in Las Vegas, Nevada) and USBC Masters (February 8–16 at the Cashman Center in Las Vegas).\nThe Dydo Japan Cup, which typically kicks off the PBA Tour season on ESPN, was delayed until late April, 2009, due to arena issues.\nA special \"Golden Anniversary Championship\" featured 16 Senior PBA bowlers (age 50 or older) who earned entry through a dedicated qualifying round at the Hammond, Indiana tour stop. The eventual top two Senior bowlers squared off in a live televised final, airing after the final match for the regular touring pros on November 9.\nThe PBA Women's Series, which began on a limited basis in the 2007–08 season, continued this season with seven events (\"see article: PBA Women's Series\"). The series featured head-to-head women's matches airing jointly with six PBA telecasts, plus a mixed doubles event with PBA professionals that aired February 1, 2009.\nTournament schedule and recap.\n\"Majors are noted in bold text. The number of titles for tournament winners is noted in parentheses. The women's title count is for PBA Women's Series events only.\"\nExemptions for 2008–09.\nThe following is a breakdown of the 58 bowlers who received a PBA exemption for most tournaments in the 2008–09 season:\n(+) \"Rhino Page topped all non-exempt bowlers during the 2007–08 season. But because Page also won a title, this exemption went to the next-highest non-exempt bowler, Edward VanDaniker Jr.\"\nThis leaves six spots that can be earned each week through the Lumber Liquidators PBA Tour Qualifying Round (TQR), for a total starting field of 64 bowlers. \"If a bowler from any of the aforementioned categories does not take his or her spot in a given week, the next-place bowler beyond 6th place in the TQR will take the spot.\"\nThere are some exceptions to this breakdown. The PBA World Championship, Dick Weber Open and PBA Marathon Championship events are open to the entire PBA membership in 2008–09. The U.S. Open and USBC Masters events are open to the entire PBA membership plus qualifying USBC amateurs.\nNewly-exempt bowlers for 2008–09.\nThe following six bowlers received 2008–09 tour exemptions by finishing with the most points in their respective PBA Regions (the East Region points leader declined his exemption). This is the last year that points alone will qualify a Regional bowler for an exemption (see main article, Professional Bowlers Association).\nIn late May 2008, the PBA held the 2008 Lumber Liquidators PBA Tour Trials to determine the final seven bowlers who would attain exempt status for the 2008–09 season. At the Tour Trials, six-time PBA titlist Dave D'Entremont led the field with a 45-game pinfall of 10,051 (223.4 average) to regain the tour exemption he lost following the 2007–08 season. Below are the seven bowlers with the largest pin totals, who received exempt status for the 2008–09 season:\n2008–09 Finals formats.\nThe 2008–09 season used a combination of bracketed and stepladder finals, plus some newly introduced finals formats. The four-player bracketed format was used four times during the season, a four-player stepladder format was used nine times, and a five-player stepladder format was used five times. In addition:"

Self-rescue can be particularly complicated on multi-pitch climbing and on alpine climbing routes, where the climber(s) are hanging from ropes on exposed rock/mountain faces."

        "text": "Dirty Tennis is a 1989 short comedy parody video about tennis instructional videos. It stars Dick Van Patten, Caitlyn Jenner and Nicollette Sheridan. It was written by James Van Patten and directed by Jonathan Baker and George J. Bloom. The short comedy was released on VHS in 1989.\nAs part of Dick Van Patton's post-\"Eight is Enough\" popularity, it was written by Van Patton's son Jimmy to depict in a comedic fashion how Dick is able to defeat a skilled opponent in a tennis game by using poor sportsmanship cheats.\nPlot.\nIn a parody of tennis instructional videos, Dick Van Patten takes on the role of an unscrupulous tennis player whose only interest is to beat opponent Caitlyn Jenner (appearing as \"Bruce Jenner\", before her transition) in any manner possible, including interruptions caused by his using a sexy Nicollette Sheridan as a secret weapon of distraction.\nReception.\n\"Star-News\" wrote, \"This 33 minute assault on uppity tennis etiquette is Jenner and Van Patton's answer to Tim Conway's \"Dorf on Golf\" attack on golf course snobbery\". Of her participation as co-producer, actress Kristy McNichol described it as a \"hilarious video about all the dirty little tricks you can play on your partner to win\", stated the short had \"done very well in the market\", and shared that producing it \"was a lot of fun.\"\n\"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" shared that Dick Van Patten as a \"self-described tennis hacker\" and Bruce Jenner as a \"dashing Olympic-class athlete\" would seem unlikely as a comic duo. They expanded that the teaming of the two such unlikely men \"in this parody of a how-to program works wonderfully,\" and \"not solely because of the contrast in their ages and conditioning.\" Van Patton as a mischievous bad fellow plays well \"against his nice-guy image\" and causes Jenner to turn \"his public persona upside-down\" by being unafraid in acting \"like a chump, preening in his sparkling tennis togs one moment and pitching a spoiled-brat tantrum the next.\" Praising the film overall, they concluded \"Suffice it to say that in the small universe of comedy tapes that have been made expressly for home video, Van Patten has come up with a winner. And although Jenner may have lost on the court, he's bound to win new respect for his abilities as a clown.\"\n\"The Washington Post\" called \"Dirty Tennis\" \"Dick Van Patten's \"Spinal Tap\"\", and wrote the film stood as \"a towering monument to the 1980s VHS era\" when \"mid-level celebrities could rent a camcorder, cobble together 60 minutes of junk video, splice it all together and ship it off to consumers who were starving to rent somethinganythingthey could jam into their VCRs.\"\nThe \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars, and wrote \"\"Dirty Tennis\" adds up to 33 minutes of malicious enjoyment, [it] is downright nastyand therefore thoroughly delightful\"."

Head Coach Gary Gilmore (903–464-1 at CCU, 1,156-566-3 overall) has led the Chanticleers to 16 NCAA Regional appearances and three Super Regional appearances since being hired in 1996. The program has received #1 regional seeds on five occasions (2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2018) and won 50+ games in 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2016. In addition, the Chanticleers hosted NCAA Regionals in 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2018.

The title game finished mere hours before Coastal officially left the Big South Conference, the school's home since 1983 (1984 baseball season), for the Sun Belt Conference. The state's governor Nikki Haley proclaimed July 1, 2016, the day after the title game and also Coastal's first official day as a Sun Belt member, \"Chanticleer Baseball National Championship Day\" throughout South Carolina.\nHistorically, Coastal's primary baseball rivals have been Winthrop, Liberty, and Charleston, although this may change following Coastal's move to the Sun Belt Conference.\nNCAA College World Series appearances.\nOn June 19, 2016, the Chanticleers baseball program made their first ever appearance in the CWS defeating #1 ranked Florida Gators.

        "title": "Speed climbing",
        "text": "Speed climbing is a climbing discipline in which speed is the ultimate goal. Speed climbing is done on rocks, walls and poles and is only recommended for highly skilled and experienced climbers. \nCompetition speed climbing, which takes place on an artificial and standardized climbing wall, is the main form of speed climbing. However, there are types of speed climbing that take place outdoors, such as climbing famous big wall climbing routes in the shortest times, notable examples being on \"El Capitan\" in Yosemite National Park.\nCompetition speed climbing.\nCompetition speed climbing as governed by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) takes place on artificial walls. Competitors climb a 5-degree overhanging IFSC-certified wall, with an auto-belaying system from the top of the wall.\nSince 2007 the IFSC has created a standard wall for the world record. The standard has a simple rule and it involves climbers competing on the same route, side by side, and whoever reaches the top first wins. The holds and order are always identical, and the difficulty rating is around F6b (approximately YDS 5.10c), which is a level most recreational climbers could complete. The IFSC also sanctions speed climbing competitions and those events that entail world record attempts. Speed climbing was one of the three climbing modalities included in the combined format at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, along with lead and bouldering. Beginning at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, speed climbing will be its own standalone competition, separate from the lead and bouldering combined event.\nTime is determined by mechanical-electric timing (the competitor leaves the starting pad and strikes a switch at the top of the route). When mechanical-electric timing is used, the climbing time is displayed with an accuracy of one-hundredth of a second. In the rules modifications in 2018, the possibility to use manual timing was removed, and the mechanical-electric timing should record with a precision of 1/1000 second. This precision is only used for ranking in case of a tie. Further, the timing system needs to announce a false start, which is considered a start earlier than 0.1 seconds after the starting beep.\nWorld champions.\nThe defending men's and women's speed climbing world champions are Matteo Zurloni of Italy and Desak Made Rita Kusuma Dewi of Indonesia, respectively; they won their respective speed events at the 2023 IFSC Climbing World Championships in Bern, Switzerland. Veddriq Leonardo of Indonesia and Natalia Kalucka of Poland were the overall men's and women's winners for the 2023 IFSC Climbing World Cup speed series. \nWorld and Olympic records.\nSince Qixin Zhong of China ran the 15-meter standardized wall in 6.26 seconds in 2011, the world record has been broken 15 times, ten times since 2021, most recently 4.798 seconds by Samuel Watson of USA in April 2024 at the Wujiang World Cup. That represents a drop of 23 percent since 2011. \nSimilarly, the women's speed climbing record has been broken 18 times since 2013, seven times since 2021, dropping from 7.85 seconds to the 6.25 seconds set by Aleksandra Mirosław of Poland in April 2023, a 20-percent reduction.\nNon-competition speed climbing.\nMost non-competition speed climbing records lack the standards normally associated with objective records. Competition speed climber Hans Florine has written about non-competition speed climbing: \"I will be the first to say that climbing is silly. To make rules about it is just piling ridiculous on top of silly.\" \nHowever, various climbers have set \"speed records\" on well-known and frequently climbed routes, such as Dan Osman climbing Lover's Leap via the \"Bear's Reach\" route (5.7, 120+ metre) in 4 min 25 sec. The most notable of such records are listed below:\nNotable non-competition records.\nCalifornia.\nThe Nose, El Capitan\nRegular Northwest Route, Half Dome\nSnake Dike, Half Dome\nJoshua Tree National Park\nColorado.\nBastille Crack\nThird Flatiron\nNevada.\nEpinephrine\nCat In The Hat\nNew York.\nThe Gunks\nWyoming.\nGrand Traverse"

        "title": "Frank Sexton (baseball)",
        "text": "Frank Joseph Sexton (July 8, 1872 – January 4, 1938) was a baseball player and coach. He played college baseball for Brown University from 1890 to 1893 and for the University of Michigan in 1894. He also played professional baseball from 1890 to 1897, including one season in Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters. He later coached college baseball at the University of Michigan (1896, 1901–1902), Brown University (1903–1910) and Harvard University (1911–1915). He also maintained a medical practice at Brookline, Massachusetts for many years.\nEarly years.\nSexton was born in Brockton, Massachusetts in either 1868 or 1872. He was the son of Irish immigrants, John and Catherine (Comvory) Sexton. He attended Brockton High School and next enrolled at Amherst College in 1888. Sexton transferred to Brown University for the 1889–1890 academic year as a member of Brown's freshman class. He was a senior at Brown during the 1893–1894 academic year. At Brown, Sexton \"won fame both as a pitcher and fielder\" for the school's baseball team. In 1890, he won his first seven games at Brown, striking out 98 and allowing only 17 hits in the seven games. He played at both pitcher, second base and center field at Brown. His battery-mate was Fred Tenney, who became a well-known first baseman in Major League Baseball. Sexton played on the Brown baseball team for four years (1890–1893) and was the team captain and coach in 1892 and 1893. He graduated from Brown in 1893.\nProfessional baseball.\nSexton appears to have made his professional baseball debut in Canada, playing for the Shamrocks, a team sponsored by the Shamrock Athletic Association in Saint John, New Brunswick. According to one account of the early days of professional baseball in Saint John, the Shamrocks went shopping for a new pitcher in 1890: \"They obtained the services of F.J. Sexton from Brown University. Sexton was a superb pitcher and received the princely salary of $150 a month\" In August 1890, Sexton helped lead the Shamrocks to the 1890 pennant with a 2–0 victory over the Saint John Athletic Association.\nSexton also played in the New England League for teams in Woonsocket and Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1891 and 1892, for New Bedford in 1893, and for his hometown team, the Brockton Shoemakers, in 1894.\nDuring the 1895 season, Sexton played Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters where he was re-united with his battery-mate from Brown, Fred Tenney. In his Major League debut on June 21, 1895, Sexton allowed only two earned runs, but the Beaneaters were defeated by Brooklyn by a score of 4–2. The \"Boston Daily Globe\" reported on Sexton's debut: \"Frank J. Sexton made his first appearance with the Boston club and pitched a first-class game, while Tenney, his old catcher, handled him in fine style.\" In his second start on June 25, 1895, Sexton got the win in a 5–2 victory over the New York Giants. The \"Boston Daily Globe\" praised Sexton's performance:\"Frank Sexton faced the Giants for the\nfirst time, and simply toyed with them, that, too, without using much speed. Five singles and one double were made by the visitors, and except for an excusable error by Long in the first inning, the Giants would have left town last evening with a shutout. Tenney and Sexton worked well, the latter holding his man at first in fine style and pitching a cool, heady game. As both Tenney and Sexton can hit and run, it made Boston by all odds the fastest nine ever put on a ball field.\"\nSexton played in his final Major League game two months later on August 17, 1895. He appeared in seven games for Boston and compiled a record of one win and five losses with a 5.69 earned run average. A history of the Boston baseball club published in 1897 noted that the club had signed several new pitchers in 1895, seeking to overcome the weak showing of the 1894 pitching staff. In the end, the author wrote of the new twirlers: \"Stocksdale, Wilson, Yerrick and Sexton were more or less frosts, and were pitched in but few games.\"\nIn 1896, Sexton played for the Springfield Ponies in the Eastern League. He concluded his career as a professional baseball player with the New Bedford Whalers. During the 1896 and 1897 seasons, he was one of the stars of the New England League, \"batting well and leading in the fielding of the league.\"\nBaseball coach.\nMichigan.\nSexton attended the University of Michigan from 1894 to 1896 as a student in the Department of Medicine and Surgery. In February 1895, \"The Michigan Alumnus\" announced, \"F.G. [sic] Sexton, Brown University's crack pitcher is a student here this year and will help with the nine.\" He joined the Michigan Wolverines baseball team as a pitcher in 1895. He pitched an 11–0 shutout against Cornell during the 1895 season. It was at the conclusion of Michigan's 1895 baseball season that Sexton signed with the Boston Beaneaters.\nAt the conclusion of his brief Major League Baseball career, Sexton returned to Michigan as a medical student. In January 1896, \"The Michigan Alumnus\" announced: \"Sexton, who pitched last season and who was change pitcher on the Boston league team last summer, has been engaged as coach and will not try for his old position.\" He reportedly agreed to coach the school's baseball team to meet the cost of his education. During the 1896 season, Sexton led the Wolverines to a 17–4–1 record. He became involved in a controversy resulting from an 1896 baseball game against Indiana at Bloomington. \"The Michigan Alumnus\" reported on the incident as follows:\"In the second half of the seventh inning, with the score 11–11, one man out and another on base, the Indiana pitcher gave out and the captain noticed this and gave his umpire the tip to call the game, which he did, giving darkness as his reason, though the teams might easily have played a half hour or more longer. Sexton, who was umpiring for Michigan, remonstrated at this, but the Indiana team left the field, giving Sexton the opportunity to declare the game forfeited to Michigan with a score of 9 to 0.\"\nAfter the game, an angry Indiana crowd closed around Sexton, and one man drew a knife on him. When the Michigan team retreated to its hotel, the crowd followed and \"again opened the dispute with Sexton.\" When one of the men raised his cane to strike Sexton, Sexton \"got him by the throat\", another rushed to his help, and the Michigan players eventually pushed the fighters to the sidewalk. A warrant was issued for Sexton's arrest, but he had already left for the train. When the Indiana captain mistakenly identified one of Michigan's players, Holmes, as Sexton, Holmes was arrested and later sued for false imprisonment. \"The Michigan Alumnus\" summarized the incident: \"The affair is unfortunate and greatly to be regretted, yet few who know the facts will blame the Michigan men for defending themselves.\"\nSexton transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in 1896 and received a Doctor of Medicine degree in June 1898. He then established a medical practice in Boston. While developing his practice, he played baseball in the summer of 1900 for the \"Roses\", a professional baseball team in Saint John, New Brunswick.\nIn 1901, Sexton agreed to take time away from his medical practice to coach the Michigan baseball team. An article in Ann Arbor's \"The Weekly Bulletin\" in April 1902 noted the Wolverines' good fortune in securing Sexton's services:\"He located near Boston, where he has a good practice now. His love for baseball, however, prompted him to respond to the urgent demands of the Michigan management for his services as coach last year, as well as for this year. Michigan ought to be very grateful to Dr. Sexton for thus bestowing his time and attention to the baseball team.\"\nSexton's contract required him to serve as coach from April to the beginning of June. He led the 1901 team to a 13–8 record. He returned to Michigan again as coach of the 1902 team, which compiled a record of 8–10. In June 1902, Sexton returned to his medical practice in North Easton, Massachusetts.\nBrown.\nWhile continuing his medical practice, Sexton served as the baseball coach at his alma mater, Brown University. He was the baseball coach at Brown for eight years from 1903 to 1910. During his years as a baseball coach at Brown, his teams \"always ranked among the best in college baseball\" and finished in first place among the Eastern college teams in his last three years as coach. He led the 1907 Brown baseball team to a perfect 21–0 record. In 1907, the \"Brown Alumni Monthly\" noted:\"Very much of this year's creditable showing is due to Frank J. Sexton, the coach, who has a great faculty for the developing of new baseball material. He has been in charge of the team two years, and we sincerely hope he will continue in charge next season. He knows the men thoroughly, is intensely interested in them, and has the advantage of being a former Brown player himself.\"\n\"The Evening News\" of Providence, Rhode Island also praised his work at Brown: \"[T]he teams that Dr. Sexton has brought out at Brown always have been good ones, and ones having a splendid idea of how baseball should be played. Sexton has developed many good players for his teams, always has put the boys on their own initiative in the games and has been a strict disciplinarian.\"\nBrown continued to practice medicine while coaching at Brown.\nHarvard.\nIn December 1910, Sexton was hired as the baseball coach at Harvard University. He was the school's first paid, professional baseball coach. Upon his arrival, Sexton promptly instituted a new training regimen, requiring the pitchers and catchers to do daily work on the gymnasium apparatus for a month before regular practice began. Sexton told the press that the work would get their arms in shape \"to avoid strains and other hurts when they begin throwing the ball around.\" In early March 1911, Sexton signed a two-year contract agreeing to coach the Harvard baseball team through the 1912 season.\nIn Sexton's first year at Harvard, the baseball team had its best record since 1901, winning 17 games and losing 6. Sexton coached at Harvard for five years from 1911 to 1915. While coaching at Harvard, Sexton drew attention for his innovative training techniques. In addition to his requiring the battery candidates to work on the gymnasium apparatus, he instituted a rigorous program of fall practice for the baseball team. Sexton told the press \"there will be no let-up until they are driven to shelter by the cold weather.\" In 1915, a publication known as \"The World's Advance\" profiled a new target device used by Sexton in the training of Harvard's pitching staff.\nWhile Sexton was at Harvard, the baseball team played an annual game against the Boston Red Sox. Although the Harvard team lost the game each year during Sexton's tenure, the scores were relatively close: 4–1 in 1910, 4–2 in 1911, 2–0 in 1912 and 5–0 in 1913.\nIn May 1915, Sexton resigned after a disagreement with the Harvard Advisory Baseball Committee. Sexton said that he resigned because of interference from the Advisory Committee with his work as coach. The dispute followed a decision by the committee to hire two former Harvard players as assistant coaches to work with the catchers and outfielders. In a letter published by \"The Boston Evening Transcript\", Sexton wrote that he did not agree to the many suggestions of the committee and concluded, \"After full consideration of the matter discussed, I felt I could not retain my self-respect and esteem owing to their persistent interference and continue as coach of the Harvard University baseball team.\" The \"Evening Transcript\" wrote that Sexton was \"considered one of the most efficient in the country\" and opined that he \"has been a good coach for Harvard and has developed some excellent teams from very ordinary material.\" The paper also reported that \"the players and the college in general have been very much upset over the resignation of Dr. Sexton.\"\nSexton filed a lawsuit against the president and fellows of Harvard in May 1916 for breach of contract, claiming that he had not been fully paid the amounts owed under his contract. Sexton sought $2,000 in unpaid salary and claimed that the Harvard Athletic Committee had interfered with his coaching and had no right to do so. During a jury trial in March 1917, Sexton gave a demonstration of his methods, placing a handkerchief on the floor as home plate, and explaining the position from which he wanted the catcher to throw the ball. Sexton testified that the person who the Athletic Committee sought to impose as an assistant coach wanted to override his instruction to the catchers. The jury ultimately returned a verdict in favor of Harvard.\nLater years.\nAfter resigning as Harvard's coach in 1915, Sexton returned to his medical practice. He also served with the rank of captain in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War I. At the time of the 1920 Census, Sexton was living at 1032 Commonwealth Avenue in Brookline, Massachusetts with his wife Louise (age 44). They had no children at that time, and Sexton's occupation was listed as a physician in general practice. In 1922, he continued to maintain a private medical practice in Brookline.\nHe died at his home in either Brookline or Brighton, Massachusetts in January 1938. The cause of death was cerebral embolus and arteriosclerosis."

        "title": "1981 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1981 Rose Bowl was the 67th Rose Bowl game and was played on January 1, 1981, at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California. The game featured the Michigan Wolverines beating the Washington Huskies by a score of 23–6. The game marked the first time Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler won a bowl game after seven prior bowl game losses.\nThe matchup.\nThe 1981 Rose Bowl matched the Big Ten Conference and Pacific-10 Conference champions. Both teams, Michigan from the Big Ten, and Washington from the Pac-10, came into the game with identical 9–2 regular season records. Michigan had lost games against Notre Dame and South Carolina, and Washington had lost to Oregon and Navy. Washington came into the game having won the Pac-10 title with a 20–10 upset victory over USC.\nDespite the identical records, Michigan was favored, due largely to the impressive play of its defense. The Michigan defense did not allow a touchdown in the last 18 quarters of the regular season and gave up only 10 first-quarter points and three touchdown passes all year. The streak included a shutout of a Purdue team led by quarterback Mark Herrmann and a victory over Ohio State in which the Buckeye offense led by Art Schlichter was held to three points. Washington Coach Don James noted, \"Michigan is playing defense so much better than anybody else in the country right now.\" Michigan's defense was led by co-captain and linebacker, Andy Cannavino, who led the team with 160 tackles (54 more than any other player on the team) to become the second leading all-time tackler in the school's history. The defense also featured linebacker, Mel Owens, tackle, Mike Trgovac, and safety Keith Bostic.\nOn offense, Michigan had All-American wide receiver, Anthony Carter, who broke the school's career record for touchdowns as a sophomore. Prior to the 1981 Rose Bowl, Schembechler called Carter \"the most gifted athlete I've ever been around.\" Michigan also featured an offensive line that included All-American George Lilja and future NFL players, Ed Muransky, Kurt Becker, and Bubba Paris.\nWashington was led by senior quarterback and Pac-10 Player of the Year, Tom Flick, who had passed for 2,178 yards in 1980. Washington also had a superb placekicker, Chuck Nelson, who led the team in scoring with 85 points on 31 extra points and 18 field goals. Don James noted that the biggest difference between the two teams was Washington's reliance on the passing game, and Michigan's reliance on the run.\nPre-game focus on Schembechler's bowl record.\nMichigan's long-time coach Bo Schembechler was the focus of much of the pre-game press coverage. Schembechler had gone winless in seven prior bowl games (five Rose Bowls, one Orange Bowl, and one Gator Bowl). Bo's record led to jokes by the media, including one Gannett reporter who opened his pre-game story by noting: \"It's bowl time, so they're playing Michigan's song again. No not The Victors, you know, Taps.\" And a UPI story opened with this line: \"Why doesn't Bo Schembechler eat cereal for breakfast? He's afraid he'd lose the bowl.\"\nMichigan's players noted their desire to win the 1981 Rose Bowl for their coach. All-American center George Lilja noted, \"We want to win for our coach as much as for ourselves.\" Michigan's co-captain, Andy Cannavino joked, \"If we win, maybe it'll look good on our resume when we go in to apply for a regular job. Maybe the boss will be sympathetic to the fact that we got Bo Schembechler his first Rose Bowl.\" The press also noted that, even though Michigan's players wanted \"desperately\" to win for their coach, Schembechler himself \"seems as laid back as a native Californian.\" Schembechler refused to predict a victory but said, \"The pressure is on us to win, but I guarantee you, our players will play their hearts out.\"\nGame summary.\nEarly in the game, Washington reached the Michigan one-yard line, but the Michigan defense stopped Washington's Toussaint Tyler on fourth down. One official initially signaled a touchdown, but changed the call after the other official reported \"he clearly saw the ball was not in.\" The first quarter ended with no score, and the highlights of the first quarter were Michigan's goal-line stand and a Rose Bowl record set by Michigan's Don Bracken with a 73-yard punt.\nIn the second quarter, Washington's placekicker Chuck Nelson kicked a 35-yard field goal, but Michigan then took the lead with a six-yard touchdown run by Butch Woolfolk. Nelson added a 26-yard field goal, and the half ended with Michigan leading 7–6.\nMichigan drove the ball 83 yards to start the second half, scoring on a 25-yard field goal from placekicker Ali Haji-Sheikh. After the game, Schembechler said the opening drive of the second half was the \"turning point.\" He noted, \"To take the kick and drive down the field on them, I think might have taken something out of them.\"\nIn the third quarter, Michigan's quarterback John Wangler completed a seven-yard touchdown pass to All-American wide receiver Anthony Carter, and Michigan led 17–6. Michigan added another touchdown in the fourth quarter on a one-yard run by Stan Edwards. The Michigan defense shut down the Washington offense in the second half, not allowing the Huskies to score. The Wolverines outgained the Huskies 304 yards to 105 in the second half.\nButch Woolfolk was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1981 Rose Bowl after rushing for 182 yards in 26 carries. Stan Edwards added 68 rushing yards, and Anthony Carter compiled 101 yards of total offense (33 rushing, 68 receiving).\nDespite allowing Washington to gain 374 total yards of offense in the game (including 282 yards passing by Flick), Michigan extended its streak to 22 quarters without giving up a touchdown.\nPost-game press coverage.\nAs had the pre-game coverage, much of the post-game coverage focused on Bo Schembechler, who had \"broken the jinx\" by winning his first bowl game after seven straight defeats. After the game, the Michigan players carried Schembechler off the field on their shoulders as the coach held his arms above his head in victory. In the post-game press conference, Schembechler said, \"I stood here five times before a loser. Now I'm smoking a cigar and smiling. ... Right now, I'm on top of the world. I feel great about everything.\" Michigan finished the season ranked No. 4 in both the AP and UPI polls—their highest ranking in any season under Schembechler in which they won the Rose Bowl (Michigan finished No. 3 in 1976 after losing the Rose Bowl, No. 2 in 1985 after winning the Fiesta Bowl, and No. 4 again in 1988 after Schembechler's only other Rose Bowl victory. Schembechler finished 2–8 in Rose Bowls and never won a national championship in his 21 seasons as head coach).\nIt was Michigan's first bowl win in sixteen years, since January 1965. The win broke the Pac-10's six-game winning streak in the Rose Bowl; it was only the second win for the Big Ten in the last twelve, and the Pac-10 won the next six."

His position of preference was in the Second Row.\nEarly years.\nSullivan grew up in Sydney where he attended Westfields Sports High School. In 1999 he toured France, Ireland and England with the Australian schoolboys team. The team was undefeated and Sullivan played alongside Braith Anasta, Mark Gasnier, Brent Tate and Jamie Lyon. As an Australian representative, Sullivan was inducted into the Westfields Sports Hall of Fame and also won a New South Wales Sporting Blue.\nParramatta Eels.\nSullivan was a junior at the Parramatta Eels while at Westfields Sports and he made his National Rugby League debut for the club in 2001. He played five games that season, coming off the bench. This was enough to earn the Eric Grothe rookie of the year award as the club's best youngster in 2001.\nHe had an impressive off season with the club in 2002, and was even talked about as a possible NRL Rookie of the Year award winner for the 2002 season. However he suffered a severe knee injury and required a knee anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This was later compounded when he developed a Golden staph infection which ruined his next two seasons and haunted him for the rest of his career.\nNew Zealand Warriors.\nIn 2004 Sullivan joined the New Zealand Warriors, seeking to rebuild his career. At the time the head coach was Daniel Anderson, who had previously coached Sullivan in the youth sides at Parramatta. Sullivan managed to play one game for the Warriors, starting in the second row, before again suffering knee problems. He was later ruled out for the season. When Daniel Anderson was fired and replaced by Tony Kemp midway through the season Sullivan decided to retire and return to Australia."

        "title": "Ricardo Brown (basketball)",
        "text": "Ricardo Vidal Brown (born May 22, 1957) is a Filipino-American former professional basketball player. His moniker was The Quick Brown Fox.\nCareer.\nBrown played for a diverse set of colleges in the United States. His performances became notable that he would later be drafted by the Houston Rockets for the 59th overall pick in the 3rd Round of the 1979 NBA Draft. Though he was not signed to any team, Brown continued to play collegiate basketball, eventually being discovered by Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. in the United States and would thereafter move to the Philippines. He had a notable career playing for the De La Salle Green Archers during many different tournaments in 1982. He would simultaneously enroll and take classes there for the remainder of the year before declaring his intention to enter the PBA.\nA year after his notable college career in DLSU, Brown moved on to play professional basketball in the PBA in 1983. It was here where he became famous in the professional stage as the first-ever Filipino-American to play as a 'local' in the league. He was the 1983 Rookie of the Year and 1985 MVP. He was also included in the Mythical Five selection in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1988. In 1983, he was only the 2nd player ever to win the coveted Rookie of the Year Award and also be named to the Mythical Five Team. In that same Rookie Year, Ricky was in a close race for league MVP with teammate Bogs Adornado and eventual MVP, Abet Guidaben. In 1985, Ricky's best year in the PBA, The Quick Brown Fox was simply awesome. He regularly scored more than 30 points per game as well as have double figures in assists. His high game that year was 56 points against Ginebra, but what many people forget is that Ricky had back-to-back 40+ games in the PBA Open Championship versus Norman Black and Magnolia. During Ricky's somewhat brief career in the PBA (only 7 years and 19 Conferences), Ricky played for the Great Taste Coffee Makers and the San Miguel Beermen, where he won a total of 9 championships during his PBA career. His ball handling skills, without question head and shoulders more advanced than any Filipino in the PBA during that era, his ability to evade defenders with intelligence and quickness, the skillset to score at will from anywhere on the court, and great presence and vision on the court to produce pin point assists made him one of the best point guards and combo guards ever to play in the PBA. Even though Ricky last played more than 27 years ago, he still holds the All-time PBA career scoring average (23.1 ppg) and PBA All-time Best Assist Average (7.3 per game), as well as the best FT percentage over a career at 87.9%.\nIn 1989, the year of San Miguel's Grand Slam (three championships in one year), he was an integral member of a powerhouse squad that included future Hall of Famers Hector Calma, Samboy Lim, and Ramon Fernandez. Brown would eventually go down in PBA history as one of the finest players and sportsmen to ever grace the hardcourts of the Philippines.\nLegacy.\nIn 2000, Brown was named a member of the PBA's 25 Greatest Players. In 2009, he was inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame along with former teammates Allan Caidic, Samboy Lim, and Hector Calma. Ricky's honors in the PBA are numerous. \nAmong these awards include Rookie of the Year and Mythical Five (1983) in the same year becoming only the 2nd player to ever achieve that honor; a Mythical Five selection in 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1988; Most Valuable Player in 1985; and 7 PBA Championships with both Great Taste and San Miguel Beer. To this day, Ricky still holds the highest career average for points per game (23) and assists (7) and the highest FT percentage. \nPersonal life.\nBrown's parents were married in Manila in 1945 and moved to the United States the next year. His father Lee Brown was an American serviceman and a former major leaguer with the St. Louis Cardinals in the MLB. Brown's mother, the former Conrada Vidal, had a family-owned photography shop in Santa Cruz, Manila. Brown has two brothers and a sister born in the Philippines. Ricardo is married to the former Lorma Sahagun, a Filipina from Ilocos Norte, and has two sons, Justin and Kevan. Kevan was born in Cardinal Santos Hospital in Greenhills, San Juan, located in Metro Manila.\nIn other media.\nBrown made a movie with the comedy king, Dolphy, in 1987 titled \"Action is Not Missing\", which was an entry to the Metro Manila Film Festival and a box-office hit.\nPost-retirement.\nRicky has been in education since 1981, first as a teacher, then a dean of students, assistant principal, and principal. In 2008, he became the first Filipino-American principal in the ABC Unified School District. Brown remained principal at Ross Academy of Creative and Media Arts, a school that became a California School To Watch and a California Gold Ribbon School during his tenure, for nine years. In June 2017, Brown became principal of Tracy High School, a Continuation School and Alternative Education Program, also in the ABC Unified School District. In 2019, Tracy was selected as a California Model Continuation School for excellence in providing a quality education and experience for its students."

        "title": "2012 European Men's Handball Championship",
        "text": "The 2012 EHF European Men's Handball Championship was the tenth edition of the men's continental handball tournament, which was held in Serbia between 15 and 29 January 2012. Sixteen teams qualified for the event, including host nation Serbia, defending champion France and fourteen national teams through the qualifying tournament. The teams were split into four groups of 4, with the top 3 teams of each group advancing to the main round, carrying the points won against other qualified opponents. Going to the main round with no points, Denmark ended up winning the championship after defeating Serbia in the final with a scoreline of 21–19.\nThe bronze medal was claimed by Croatia, who defeated Spain 31–27 to win their second bronze and fourth European medal overall. In the placement match for the 5th position Macedonia proved to be too strong for Slovenia and won the match by 28–27. Macedonian right back Kiril Lazarov led his team with 8 goals to success and took the top scorers' award with a European Championship record of 61 goals. Over 300,000 spectators were present in 47 matches during the tournament, which was also a new championship record.\nBy winning the European title, Denmark directly qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics, while Serbia and Macedonia secured a spot in the Olympic Qualification Tournament. Thanks to the Danish triumph, Poland also made it to the qualifiers as the eighth ranked team of the 2011 World Championship.\nDenmark, Serbia and Croatia as three best-ranked teams qualified directly for 2013 World Men's Handball Championship.\nThe championship was somewhat overshadowed by incidents that occurred during the final week of the event. On 26–27 January, in violent attacks, cars were damaged or set on fire, and several Croatian supporters were injured. In the semifinal match between Serbia and Croatia, Žarko Šešum, the back player of the Serbian team had his eye severely injured after a bottle intended for Croatian player Ivano Balić and coach Slavko Goluža was thrown at him.\nBidding process.\nThe bids were as follows:\nSerbia was awarded the championship on the EHF Congress in Vienna 27 September 2008, narrowly defeating the French bid by three votes. Serbia would host the tournament in the cities of Belgrade, Niš, Novi Sad and Vršac.\nQualification.\nThe 2012 Championship was the second for which the new qualification system was used.\nReferees.\nOn 12 September 2011, 12 couples were announced in Vienna.\nSeeding.\nThe draw was held on 15 June 2011 in Belgrade at 12:00 local time. The seeding was announced on 13 June 2011.\nGroup stage.\nThe match schedule was released and confirmed on 18 April 2011. Four teams were selected to play in the four venue cities, Serbia in Belgrade, Macedonia at Niš, Hungary at Novi Sad and Croatia in Vršac. The playing schedule was announced on 1 July.\n\"All times are UTC+1.\"\nGroup A.\nVenue: Pionir Hall, Belgrade\nGroup B.\nVenue: Čair Sports Center, Niš\nGroup C.\nVenue: Spens Sports Center, Novi Sad\nGroup D.\nVenue: Millennium Centar, Vršac\nMain round.\nGroup stage results between teams that qualified for the main round were carried over.\nGroup I.\nVenue: Belgrade Arena, Belgrade\nInitial standing and matches.\n(A) and (B) indicates from which group the teams came; in the main round they were playing only against teams from the other group. By three victories and the misfortune of among others Germany, Denmark qualified for the semifinals together with the host, Serbia. Notable results were Denmark's last second win against Macedonia and Poland's turnaround of first-half 9-20 result to win second half by the same numbers to equalize against Sweden.\nGroup II.\nVenue: Spens Sports Center, Novi Sad\nInitial standing and matches.\n(C) and (D) above indicates from which group the teams came, in the main round they are only playing against teams from the other group.\nKnockout stage.\nVenue: Belgrade Arena, Belgrade\nFinal.\nThe final was played at the Belgrade Arena between the host-nation Serbia and Denmark, and was seen by 19,800 spectators. The teams played a match against each other in the group stage of the tournament, when Serbia defeated Denmark 24–22. Serbia's coach Veselin Vuković could not rely on Žarko Šešum, whose left eye was injured after he was hit with a bottle on the halftime break of the semi-final match against Croatia.\nThe match started with tough play by both teams and low scoring. Denmark claimed the lead in the early phase of the match and controlled the period. Serbia's attacks were ineffective, and goalkeeper Darko Stanić made several saves. The Danes made fewer mistakes in the attacks and Anders Eggert scored important goals in the counter-attacks. Denmark led at halftime 9–7.\nEarly in the second half Denmark took an 11–7 lead, but then the Serbian players halted the opponent's run with a better play in defence, except for Mikkel Hansen who scored with his powerful shots in the critical moments of the game. The Danes were having the lead all the time with a margin of 1–4 goals and thanks to the saves of their goalkeeper Niklas Landin Jacobsen prevented the Serbians to level the result. The last minutes of the game were played with many mistakes on both sides, but Hansen scored the decisive goal for peerless lead 21–18 with 20 seconds to go. Serbia scored until the end making it 21–19 in favor of Denmark at the end. This was the second title for Denmark after they have previously won the European Championship in 2008.\nRanking and statistics.\nFinal ranking.\nThe final ranking for places 7 to 16 was determined by the team's group stage record. In case the ranking would have been relevant for Olympic qualification, there would have been a placement match for 7th and 9th place.\nControversies.\nRiots.\nOn 24 January 2012, after the match between Croatia and France, Serbian hooligans attacked Croatian fans in several locations in Vojvodina, northern Serbia. In Novi Sad, Croatian supporters were heading home after the game, when they ran into a road block and some 50 masked men assaulted them with stones, bricks and axes, smashing windscreens. The attack left several supporters injured and one of them hospitalized. In Ruma, about south from Novi Sad, a Croatian van was set on fire and one of the passengers stabbed with a knife.\nA day later the unrest continued and many cars were damaged, torched, or burnt out throughout Novi Sad. The Croatian Foreign Ministry officially complained to Serbian Ambassador Stanimir Vukicevic over the attacks; Vukicevic expressed regret and stated that the Serbian police was already taking the necessary steps. Thirteen people were arrested in connection with the incident, including Ivan Ključovski and Jovan Bajić, leaders of a fan group from Novi Sad, and a member of the Obraz right-wing organization. After questioning, all of them remained in custody for a month.\nSerbia–Croatia semifinal.\nSerbia and Croatia met in the semi-final of the tournament, which caused further concern on both sides. About 5,000 policemen were deployed to ensure the security of the fans, while in Croatia some tourist agencies cancelled trips for the match and the Croatian Handball Federation (Hrvatski rukometni savez, HRS) also recommended not to go to Serbia as the supporters' safety might not be guaranteed. Spokesman Zlatko Skrinjar also added that the HRS had planned to organize trips for the event, however, they changed their mind due to the incidents in the preceding days. On the Croatian-Serbian border, joint checkpoints were set up to prevent hooligans and other groups who have no ticket for the match to enter Serbia, and to escort the fans with tickets from the border to Belgrade.\nThe police reported that there were no incidents during the match, which was eventually won by the Serbians 26–22, however, a bottle actually meant for Croatian playmaker Ivano Balić and coach Slavko Goluža hit Serbian back player Žarko Šešum, severely injuring his eye. Šešum's eye suffered significant bleeding. After the trauma he had only minimal vision on the affected eye, but the risk of permanent sight loss was reportedly averted. Morten Stig Christensen, Secretary of the Danish Handball Federation, Serbia's opponent in the final said that he was \"severely shocked\" by the incident and so were the people from the European Handball Federation with whom he spoke. Christensen also added that he was shocked that although there were more than five thousand security personnel at the stadium, the hooligans still managed to sneak in Roman candles and laser lights."

        "text": "The 2009 Challenge Cup (also known as the Carnegie Challenge Cup for sponsorship reasons) was the 108th staging of the most prestigious knock-out competition in rugby league. Teams from England, Scotland, Wales, France and Russia were included in the tournament. It began in January 2009.\nTeams from the Co-operative Championship received byes into round three along with four teams from France, and the winner of the Russian Championship. Teams from the Super League enter in round four.\nDefending champions St. Helens lost in the semi-final 14 – 24 to the Huddersfield Giants who went on to lose the final 16 – 25 to the Warrington Wolves.\nFor 2009, the early stages of the competition was revamped. As the competition has expanded, there was now a preliminary round before the first round, and teams were placed into two 'pools' for the preliminary, first and second rounds.\nPools.\nPool A features 48 teams, made up as follows:\nPool B features 16 teams, which is a mixed bag of Rugby League Conference teams (including representatives from Scotland and Wales), armed forces representative teams and University teams.\nPreliminary round.\nPool A.\nAll matches were due to be played on 3–4 January, however, winter weather forced the postponement of most of these fixtures due to frozen pitches. The round is divided into two pools, with several teams receiving a bye to the First Round:\n†: fixtures rearranged due to frozen pitches. New dates varied between teams, depending on clashes with league fixtures and weather.\nPool B.\nFixtures played 17–18 January:\nPool A Byes: West Hull, Thatto Heath Crusaders, Myton Warriors, Orchard Park and Greenwood, Eastmoor Dragons, East Hull, Sharlston Rovers, Kells, Hull Isberg, East Leeds, Pilkington Recs, West Bowling, Milford Marlins, Crossfields, Waterhead, Castleford Panthers\nPool B Byes: St Mary's University College, RAF, Warrington Wizards, Featherstone Lions, Hull University, Edinburgh Eagles, Northumbria University, Royal Navy\nRound 1.\nAll matches played on 24–25 January. The round was divided into two pools, with the teams that received a bye in the last round entering.\nPool A.\n†: fixtures rearranged for 31 January due to flooded pitches.\nRound 2.\nDraw hosted by Wath Brow Hornets on 27 January, as the winners of the Cumbrian derby in the first round. Matches were played 14–15 February.\nRound 3.\nDraw was made live on BBC Radio Manchester on 17 February. All twenty Co-operative Championship teams were added into the competition in this round, as well as four teams from the French Elite One Championship, and winners of the 2008 Russian Championship, RC Lokomotiv Moscow. The matches were played on 7–8 March.\nRound 4.\nThe draw for round 4 was made live on 9 March on BBC Radio 5 Live. The sixteen victorious Co-operative Championship teams from round 3 were joined by all fourteen Super League XIV teams, as well as Wath Brow Hornets, the competition's only amateur club remaining at this stage, and Lezignan, making this the Round of 32. From this point, no more teams were added to the competition.\nAll ties were played 3–5 April.\nAverage attendance: 4,270\nRound 5.\nThe sixteen teams remaining after Round 4 were randomly paired against each other, in a draw held at RAF Leeming on 7 April involving AVM Chris Davison, Director of the RAF Sports Board, and Barrie McDermott, former Leeds and Great Britain and Ireland player.\nAll matches were played on 9–10 May. The match between Gateshead Thunder and Oldham R.L.F.C. was due to be played at the Gateshead International Stadium, since Gateshead were the home team, however the match was rearranged to be played at the Darlington Arena due to a fixture clash between a playoff match for Gateshead F.C., who share the stadium with the rugby league side, and an athletics meeting. This was the first ever professional rugby league match to be held inside County Durham.\nThe first match of this round was a repeat of a Super League fixture only thirteen days earlier. Wakefield Trinity took the initial lead, scoring ten points in six minutes, before Wigan levelled the game by the 24th minute. An early drop goal by Danny Brough edged Wakefield ahead by one point before Wigan scored their third try to lead 11–16 going into half time, following a successful conversion by Pat Richards. Wakefield scored their only try of the second half after 51 minutes, before Wigan scored two more tries to win the game by a margin of eleven points.\nOldham also started off taking the initial lead before losing to the Gateshead Thunder. Tommy Goulden gave the visitors a lead of six points following a successful conversion, and this gave them a 4–6 lead at half time following a Gateshead try which was unsuccessfully converted. Four tries and three goals from Gateshead after the break handed them a twenty-two-point lead, and two tries and a goal from Oldham were not enough to restore the deficit. A final Gateshead try ended the game with a firm 18-point margin in favour of Gateshead.\nThe first game ever to be concluded via the golden point rule was played at The Jungle. Halifax earned a ten-point lead through a try and two goals, one of which a penalty. Castleford replied with a converted try, before Halifax kicked another penalty goal to lead 6–12. The home side again scored a try, which was converted, before Halifax kicked another penalty goal before half time. Halifax scored first with a try after the break, before Castleford scored another of their own. Another try for Halifax was countered with three Castleford tries, one of which was successfully converted to give them a 30–22 lead. Two converted Halifax tries put them into the lead by four points with ten minutes to play, but a try from Brent Sherwin on the 74th minute levelled the game at full-time. Sherwin also scored the drop goal three minutes into extra time to send Castleford through after an historic fixture.\nHuddersfield won their early morning kick-off against Rochdale Hornets despite two late tries from the away side. Luke Robinson opened up the scoring on six minutes to score the first of five first-half tries for Huddersfield, to which Rochdale had no reply. Huddersfield scored again after 44 minutes to put themselves 32 points to nil ahead, before two converted Rochdale tries lowered the deficit to twenty points. Shaun Lunt finished the game off five minutes from full-time with a try that was successfully converted to provide himself with a hat-trick, and to give Huddersfield a comfortable win.\nLike Oldham and Wakefield had done the day before, Featherstone Rovers took the initiative before losing to the opposition. Featherstone took a four-point lead thanks to a try which was unsuccessfully converted before Warrington scored twenty unanswered first-half points with four tries and two conversions. Chris Hicks converted his own try shortly after the break to put Warrington 4–26 into the lead before Featherstone replied with what was to be their final try. Warrington proceeded to run in five tries before full-time, all of which were converted by Hicks, to win the game by almost a half-century of points.\nSalford City Reds had lost three of their previous matches prior to this round's fixture, but this did not stop eight Salford City Reds players touching down for tries as they delivered the widest winning margin of the round away to Batley. Eight tries and eight goals, seven of which made up John Wilshere's ten goal match tally, scored by Salford City Reds went unanswered as Batley went into half-time fighting a 48-point deficit. Two further converted tries from Salford City Reds, including Mark Henry's fourth try, came before Batley's only try of the afternoon, which was not converted. Luke Adamson touched down two minutes from full-time to give a winning margin of 62 in favour of Salford City Reds.\nOf the four Co-operative Championship sides facing Super League opposition on the Sunday, Sheffield Eagles came closest to winning, with Hull Kingston Rovers having to regalvanise themselves to prevent a Sheffield come-from-behind victory. The Sheffield Eagles only scored one converted try in the first forty minutes compared to the Hull Kingston Rovers' four tries and three goals which had given them a sixteen-point advantage going into half time, but Sheffield struck back quickly after the break with a converted try in the 41st minute. Sheffield scored again fifteen minutes later with a converted try to put them only four points behind, before Shaun Briscoe went over the try-line and Michael Dobson converted to restore a ten-point advantage. Sheffield scored another try to lower the gap to four points again, but a late Rovers try in the 77th minute ended the game to advance them through to the quarterfinals instead of Sheffield.\nIn a repeat of the 2007 Challenge Cup Final, St. Helens overcame French opposition in the outfit of the Catalans Dragons to reach the quarterfinals and maintain their four-year unbeaten cup run. Two tries within ten minutes gave an eight-point advantage to the home side before Thomas Bosc kicked a penalty to reduce the lead to 8–2. Catalans scored a converted try in the 21st minute to level game, before two tries and a goal for St Helens meant an 18–8 half time scoreline. Catalans failed to score at all in the second half, whilst to the contrary, St Helens ran in four tries, two of which were scored by Paul Wellens. All of the second half tries were converted by Sean Long to give the home side a winning margin of 34 points.\nAverage attendance: 3,853\nQuarter finals.\nThe sixth round of the Challenge Cup involves the eight teams who won their respective matches in the previous round. This is the final round where home field advantage is given, due to the requirement that all semi-final matches must be played at a neutral venue.\nThe draw was made live on BBC Two at the GPW Recruitment Stadium on 10 May. Chris Joynt, four times winner of the Challenge Cup with St. Helens drew the home sides, while Andy Farrell OBE, four times winner with the Wigan Warriors, drew the away sides.\nThe matches were played on 29–31 May, during the hottest weekend of the year so far temperature-wise.\nA sunny Friday evening at the JJB Stadium provided host to the round's first match, between the Wigan Warriors and Salford City Reds. Salford City Redswere victorious in their last three games going into this match, with Wigan hoping to get back to winning ways after a defeat to Warrington at the Halliwell Jones Stadium. Both players were also missing a player, Wigan's Stuart Fielden for disciplinary reasons, and Darrell Goulding for Salford City Reds, on loan from Wigan, who was cup-tied for playing against Barrow Raiders earlier on in the competition. A line break from Gareth Hock gave the home side a six-point lead after two minutes, following a successful conversion from Pat Richards. Salford City Reds replied nine minutes later with a line break of their own, eventually resulting in a try for Luke Adamson, converted by John Wilshere. It was to be the only Salford City Reds score of the match, but Wigan failed to take full control after forty minutes in only scoring one further try from Pat Richards on the wing to make the score 10–6 on the half-time hooter. However, Wigan scored eighteen unanswered points in the second half, with Pat Richards kicking a goal on the 49th minute, and scoring two more tries on the 59th and 70th minute to complete his hat-trick, the latter of which was converted. Hock scored another try of his own after 76 minutes, with Richards kicking the conversion to bring his individual total for the match to twenty, booking Wigan's place in the semi-finals for the first time since 2007.\nA Lee Briers drop goal in extra-time was all that separated Hull Kingston Rovers and Warrington Wolves at \"New\" Craven Park on the Saturday in a closely fought game. Both sides were in winning form, with Warrington Wolves having assembled three wins in a row, and Hull Hull Kingston Rovers having won their previous six matches. The two sides had recent history in the competition, when in 2006, Warrington Wolves were knocked-out by Hull Kingston Rovers, who were then in National League One. The home side were first on the scoresheet after centre Kris Welham crossed the line in the 3rd minute. The conversion attempt was successful from Michael Dobson, before Vinnie Anderson replied for Warrington Wolves on the 17th minute to put the scores level following a Briers conversion. In spite of attacking play from both sides, the game ended at half time 6–6. Warrington Wolves seized the initiative four minutes after the break thanks to a converted Jon Clarke try, however, Hull Kingston Rovers levelled the game again five minutes later when Clint Newton crossed over the tryline. The home side pressed a ten-point advantage with two 53rd and 60th minute tries from Ben Galea and Jake Webster respectively, the latter of which was the only unsuccessful conversion of the match. Warrington Wolves matched Hull Kingston Rovers with two tries of their own in five minutes from Matt King and Chris Bridge, to put them two points ahead with ten minutes left to play. A penalty conceded to the side of Warrington Wolves 's left upright was kicked by Hull Kingston Rovers's Dobson three minutes from full-time to force the game into a golden point situation, the score being 24–24 at the final hooter. Hull Kingston Rovers did not gain enough territory to allow Dobson a chance at a drop goal, whilst conversely Briers missed three attempts, once to the right side facing him and twice to the left side of the uprights, before landing his fourth attempt five minutes into extra time.\nIn contrast, the match at the Gateshead International Stadium could barely have been more one-sided, with St. Helens running out eventual winners against the Gateshead Thunder. St Helens scored twice in the first five minutes, with tries from Matthew Gidley and James Roby, both conversions missed. A brief lull in the game was ended with another St Helens try after 21 minutes from fullback Paul Wellens, and this was converted by Sean Long. Chris Flannery scored in the 25th minute, before a barrage of three St Helens tries in five minutes from Maurie Fa'asavalu, Kyle Eastmond and Leon Pryce respectively put the visitors 0–36 ahead following three conversions from Eastmond. Gateshead scored their solitary try before half-time when Ben McAlpine scored, and Nick Youngquest converted. The second half saw thirty unanswered points from St Helens with five tries in the 51st, 54th, 57th, 64th and 72nd minutes, all of which were successively converted by Eastmond to continue St Helens' four-year unbeaten cup run, finish the score at 6–66, and end any chance of a Co-operative Championship team reaching Wembley this year.\nThe local derby between Huddersfield and Castleford was the solitary game on the Sunday, due to BBC coverage. Huddersfield were fresh from a 48-point winning margin over Wakefield Trinity from the Super League round the week before, whilst Castleford had not won a match during regular time in four games. Despite the form book, it was Castleford who gained the early advantage thanks to an aerial take from Michael Shenton following Rangi Chase's kick, before crashing over the tryline on the way back down to give Castleford a 0–4 lead after three minutes. Several passages later, Kevin Brown dummied his way for a try in front of the uprights which was successfully converted by Brett Hodgson. Huddersfield had a disallowed try before Castleford kicked a penalty two minutes before half-time to make a 6–6 scoreline at the break. Huddersfield again had a try disallowed for a forward pass, before Brett Ferres scored his only try, and two Kirk Dixon goals gave the visitors a 6–14 lead after fifty minutes. Huddersfield did not concede again, and following a twenty-minute lull, scored a try thanks to Stephen Wild, which was successfully converted. Determined Castleford defending kept Huddersfield out for nine further minutes, before Danny Kirmond scored the match winning try in the 77th minute to send Huddersfield through to the semi-final stage.\nAverage attendance: 6,955\nSemi finals.\nThe four teams remaining play against each other for straight access into the Final. All matches in this round are played on a neutral venue. The draw was made live on BBC Two following coverage of the quarterfinal match between Huddersfield Giants and Castleford Tigers on 31 May. Only nine days after losing their Super League XIV tie at the Halliwell Jones Stadium, Wigan Warriors were drawn against the Warrington Wolves, whilst a repeat of the 2006 Challenge Cup Final was made with St. Helens versus Huddersfield Giants.\nOne match is played on Saturday 8 August, the other is played the day after. The dates and venues were confirmed on 2 June, with Wigan Warriors vs Warrington Wolves being played in Widnes at the Stobart Stadium Halton on the Saturday, and St Helens vs Huddersfield being played on the Sunday at the Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington.\nWigan vs Warrington.\nA Matt King hat-trick ended Wigan's dreams of going to Wembley in 2009, putting Warrington into their first Challenge Cup final since 1990, despite the return of Wigan's captain Sean O'Loughlin following a knee injury. The video referee declined a Warrington try from Ben Westwood on grounds of obstruction, and Wigan also had a disallowed try from winger Pat Richards, but it was Wigan who took the initiative thanks to a side-step from Phil Bailey after seven minutes; the try was successfully converted by Richards. Two further points were added to Wigan's tally following a penalty, to give an 8–0 lead. Warrington rallied to score twenty-four unanswered points by the half-time break, with two tries from King as well as tries from Louis Anderson, Lee Briers and Michael Cooper, before King completed his hat-trick in the 48th minute to give the Wolves a 24-point lead. Sam Tomkins, in his first season of first-team rugby, started a Wigan fightback as he caught an offload from the right wing by George Carmont before grounding the ball beneath the sticks. Chris Riley was stretchered off for concussion and whiplash after colliding with Joel Tomkins' knee, and Wigan took advantage of this with two further tries from Andy Coley and Thomas Leuluai which were both converted to reduce Wigan's arrears to six points. Briers kicked a drop goal the set afterwards to give Warrington safety, before the game was sealed with a Chris Hicks try to give the full-time score of 26–39.\nSt Helens vs Huddersfield.\nA Francis Meli hat-trick was not enough to extend St Helens' four-year unbeaten run in the Challenge Cup with a victory in Warrington. Man of the match Brett Hodgson opened up the points tally with a try in the fifth minute, although he failed to convert it. Meli scored on the wing five minutes later to level the game following another missed conversion from Kyle Eastmond. Stephen Wild scored the only other try of the first-half following a line break from Kevin Brown, which was converted to give Huddersfield a 4–10 lead. Huddersfield extended the advantage further, scoring two tries from Leroy Cudjoe and Brown in the first ten minutes of the second half, although Brett Hodgson again missed both. Meli cross the line again on the wing to bring the score to 10–18. A strong defensive performance from Huddersfield prevented another St Helens score, and Wild's second try three minutes from full-time gave the Giants a 14-point advantage. St Helens' solitary try-scorer Meli scored on the wing straight from the kick-off to complete his hat-trick, but there was not enough time for a comeback.\nFinal.\nThe Carnegie 2009 Challenge Cup Final was played on 29 August, eight rounds and almost eight months after the tournament started in its preliminary stages. Following tradition, the match was held in London at Wembley Stadium. The game finished with Warrington Wolves defeating the Huddersfield Giants 16–25 following two controversial disallowed tries for the Giants, which if awarded would have won them the game if at least one conversion attempt was good.\nTelevision coverage.\nSelected matches were televised solely by the BBC in the United Kingdom.\n1 Except Yorkshire.\n2 Coverage in Northern Ireland (including analogue) was televised an hour later.\nThe competition was also televised by Nine Network in Australia."

        "text": "The 2008 FIFA Club World Cup final was the final match of the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup, an association football tournament for the champion clubs from each of FIFA's six continental confederations. The match took place at the International Stadium Yokohama, Japan, on 21 December 2008, and pitted LDU Quito of Ecuador, the CONMEBOL club champions, and Manchester United of England, the UEFA club champions. Despite going down to ten men early in the second half, Manchester United won the match 1–0 thanks to a 73rd-minute goal from Wayne Rooney.\nRoad to final.\nBoth Manchester United and LDU Quito qualified for the competition at the semi-final stage, after winning their respective continental competition, the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League and the 2008 Copa Libertadores.\nLDU Quito's opening game was against Mexican side Pachuca, who had defeated Egyptian club Al Ahly 4–2 in the quarter-finals after extra time. Their semi-final match was played at the National Stadium in Tokyo on 17 December 2008. LDU Quito scored two goals in the first 26 minutes, through Claudio Bieler and Luis Bolaños, securing a place in the Club World Cup final.\nManchester United's semi-final opponents were Gamba Osaka, who had previously defeated Australian A-League premiers and Asian Champions League runners-up Adelaide United (1–0) to move into the second semi-final on 18 December. Nemanja Vidić and Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring in the first half, putting Manchester United ahead by two goals at half time. Masato Yamazaki was the next to score, in the 74th minute, to bring Gamba back into the competition, but Wayne Rooney scored twice and Darren Fletcher once within the next five minutes to extend United's lead. Yasuhito Endō converted an 85th-minute penalty kick and Hideo Hashimoto got a third for Gamba just minutes before the final whistle. The result was 5–3, taking Manchester United to the final."

        "title": "Bowling",
        "text": "Bowling is a target sport and recreational activity in which a player rolls a ball toward pins (in pin bowling) or another target (in target bowling). The term \"bowling\" usually refers to pin bowling (most commonly ten-pin bowling), though in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, bowling could also refer to target bowling, such as lawn bowls.\nIn pin bowling, the goal is to knock over pins on a long playing surface known as a \"lane\". Lanes have a wood or synthetic surface onto which protective lubricating oil is applied in different specified oil patterns that affect ball motion. A strike is achieved when all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, and a spare is achieved if all the pins are knocked over on a second roll. Common types of pin bowling include ten-pin, candlepin, duckpin, nine-pin, and five-pin. The historical game skittles is the forerunner of modern pin bowling.\nIn target bowling, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a mark as possible. The surface in target bowling may be grass, gravel, or synthetic. Lawn bowls, bocce, carpet bowls, pétanque, and boules may have both indoor and outdoor varieties. Curling is also related to bowls. \nBowling is played by 120 million people in more than 90 countries (including 70 million people in the United States alone).\nVariations.\nBowling games can be distinguished into two general classes, pin bowling and target bowling.\nPin bowling.\nFive main variations are found in North America, with ten-pin being the most common but others being practiced in the eastern U.S. and in parts of Canada:\nTarget bowling.\nAnother form of bowling is usually played outdoors on a lawn. At outdoor bowling, the players throw a ball, which is sometimes eccentrically weighted, in an attempt to put it closest to a designated point or slot in the bowling arena. (Ex: Bocce Ball, an Italian lawn game)\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nThe earliest known forms of bowling date back to ancient Egypt, with wall drawings depicting bowling being found in a royal Egyptian tomb dated to 3200 BC and miniature pins and balls in an Egyptian child's grave about 3200 BC. Remnants of bowling balls were found among artifacts in ancient Egypt going back to the Egyptian protodynastic period in 3200 BC. What is thought to be a child's game involving porphyry (stone) balls, a miniature trilithon, and nine breccia-veined alabaster vase-shaped figures—thought to resemble the more modern game of skittles—was found in Naqada, Egypt, in 1895.\nBalls were made using the husks of grains, covered in a material such as leather, and bound with string. Other balls made of porcelain have also been found, indicating that these were rolled along the ground rather than thrown due to their size and weight. Some of these resemble the modern-day jack used in target bowl games. Bowling games of different forms are also noted by Herodotus as an invention of the Lydians in Asia Minor.\nAbout 2,000 years ago, in the Roman Empire, a similar game evolved between Roman legionaries entailing the tossing of stone objects as close as possible to other stone objects, which eventually evolved into Italian Bocce, or outdoor bowling.\nAround AD 400, bowling began in Germany as a religious ritual to cleanse oneself from sin by rolling a rock into a club (kegel) representing the heathen, resulting in bowlers being called keglers.\nPost-classical history.\nIn 1299, the oldest-surviving known bowling green for target style bowling was built: Master's Close (now the Old Bowling Green of the Southampton Bowling Club) in Southampton, England, which is still in use.\nIn 1325, laws were passed in Berlin and Cologne that limited bets on lawn bowling to five shillings.\nIn 1366, the first official mention of bowling in England was made, when King Edward III banned it as a distraction to archery practice.\nIn the 15th–17th centuries, lawn bowling spread from Germany into Austria, Switzerland, and the Low Countries, with playing surfaces made of cinders or baked clay.\nIn 1455, lawn bowling lanes in London were first roofed-over, turning bowling into an all-weather game. In Germany, they were called kegelbahns and were often attached to taverns and guest houses.\nIn 1463, a public feast was held in Frankfurt, Germany, with a venison dinner followed by lawn bowling.\nModern history.\nIn the 16th to 18th centuries.\nEnglish King Henry VIII was an avid bowler. In 1511, he banned bowling for the lower classes and imposed a levy for private lanes to limit them to the wealthy. Another English law, passed in 1541 (repealed in 1845), prohibited workers from bowling except at Christmas, and then only in their master's home and in his presence. In 1530, he acquired Whitehall Palace in central London as his new residence, having it extensively rebuilt complete with outdoor bowling lanes, indoor tennis court, jousting tiltyard, and cockfighting pit.\nProtestant Reformation founder Martin Luther set the number of pins (which varied from 3 to 17) at nine. He had a bowling lane built next to his home for his children, sometimes rolling a ball himself.\nOn 19 July 1588, English Vice-Admiral Sir Francis Drake allegedly was playing bowls at Plymouth Hoe when the arrival of the Spanish Armada was announced; he replied, \"We have time enough to finish the game and beat the Spaniards too.\"\nIn 1609, Dutch East India Company explorer Henry Hudson discovered Hudson Bay, bringing Dutch colonization to New Amsterdam (later New York); Hudson's men brought some form of lawn bowling with them.\nIn 1617, English King James I published \"Declaration of Sports\", banning bowling on Sundays but permitting dancing and archery for those first attending an Anglican service, outraging Puritans; it was reissued in 1633 by his successor Charles I, then ordered publicly burned in 1643 by the Puritan Parliament.\nIn 1670, Dutchmen liked to bowl at the Old King's Arms Tavern near modern-day 2nd and Broadway in New York City.\nIn 1733, Bowling Green in New York City was built on the site of a Dutch cattle market and parade ground, becoming the city's oldest public park to survive to modern times.\nIn the 19th century.\nA circa 1810 painting of Ipswich, England shows a man bowling with a triangular formation of ten pins, before that variant of the sport is believed to have appeared in the United States. An , also in Ipswich, explicitly mentions \"ten-pin and skittle grounds\".\nIn 1819, New York writer Washington Irving made the first mention of ninepin bowling in American literature in his story \"Rip Van Winkle\".\nNewspaper articles and advertisements at least as early as 1820 refer to \"ten pin alleys\", usually in the context of a side attraction to a main business or property as distinguished from dedicated \"bowling alley\" establishments as presently understood.\nBy the late 1830s, New York's Knickerbocker Hotel housed a bowling alley with three lanes.\nIn 1846, the oldest surviving bowling lanes in the United States were built as part of Roseland Cottage, the summer estate of Henry Chandler Bowen (1831–1896) in Woodstock, Connecticut. The lanes, now part of Historic New England's Roseland Cottage House Museum contain Gothic Revival architectural elements in keeping with the style of the entire estate.\nIn 1848, the Revolutions of 1848 resulted in accelerated German immigration to the U.S., reaching 5 million by 1900, bringing their love of beer and bowling with them; by the late 19th century they made New York City a center of bowling.\nIn 1848, the Scottish Bowling Association for lawn bowling was founded in Scotland by 200 clubs; it was dissolved then refounded in 1892.\nIn 1864, Glasgow cotton merchant William Wallace Mitchell (1803–1884) published \"Manual of Bowls Playing\", which became a standard reference for lawn bowling in Scotland.\nIn 1875, the National Bowling Association (NBA) was founded by 27 local clubs in New York City to standardize rules for ten-pin bowling, setting the ball size and the distance between the foul line and the pins, but failing to agree on other rules; it was superseded in 1895 by the American Bowling Congress.\nIn 1880, Justin White of Worcester, Massachusetts, invented Candlepin Bowling.\nIn the 1880s, Brunswick Corporation (founded 1845) of Chicago, Illinois, maker of billiard tables began making bowling balls, pins, and wooden lanes to sell to taverns installing bowling alleys.\nOn 9 September 1895, the modern standardized rules for ten-pin bowling were established in New York City by the new American Bowling Congress (ABC) (later the United States Bowling Congress), who changed the scoring system from a maximum 200 points for 20 balls to a maximum 300 points for 12 balls, and set the maximum ball weight at , and pin distance at . The first ABC champion (1906–1921) was Jimmy Smith (1885–1948). In 1927 Mrs. Floretta \"Doty\" McCutcheon (1888–1967) defeated Smith in an exhibition match, founding a school that taught 500,000 women how to bowl. In 1993 women were allowed to join the ABC. In 2005 the ABC merged with the Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC) et al. to become the United States Bowling Congress (USBC).\nIn the early 1890s, Duckpin bowling was invented in Boston, Massachusetts, spreading to Baltimore, Maryland about 1899.\nIn the 20th century.\nIn 1903, the English Bowling Association was founded by cricketer W. G. Grace. On 1 January 2008, it merged with the English Women's Bowling Association to become Bowls England.\nIn 1903, D. Peifer of Chicago, Illinois, invented a handicap method for bowling.\nIn 1905, Rubber Duckpin bowling was invented by Willam Wuerthele of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, catching on in Quebec, Canada.\nThe ABC initially used bowling balls made of Lignum vitae hardwood from the Caribbean, which were eventually supplanted by the \"Evertrue\" rubber bowling ball, and the Brunswick \"Mineralite\" rubber ball by 1905. Columbia Industries, founded in 1960, was the first manufacturer to successfully use polyester resin (\"plastic\") in bowling balls. In 1980, urethane-shell bowling balls were introduced by Ebonite.\nRules for target bowls evolved separately in each of the other countries that adopted the predominantly British game. In 1905, the International Bowling Board was formed; its constitution adopted the laws of the Scottish Bowling Association, with variations allowed at the individual country level.\nIn September 1907, the Victorian Ladies' Bowling Association was founded in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, becoming the world's first women's lawn bowling association.\nIn 1908, the now-oldest surviving bowling alley for the tenpin sport was opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the basement of the Holler House tavern, containing the oldest sanctioned lanes in the United States.\nIn 1909, the first ten-pin bowling alley in Europe was installed in Sweden, but the game failed to catch on in the rest of Europe until after World War II. Meanwhile, ten-pin bowling caught on in Great Britain after hundreds of bowling lanes were installed on U.S. military bases during World War II.\nIn 1913, the monthly \"Bowlers Journal\" was founded in Chicago, Illinois, continuing to publish to the present day.\nIn late 1916, the Women's International Bowling Congress (originally the Woman's National Bowling Association) was founded in Saint Louis, Missouri, merging with the United States Bowling Congress in 2005.\nIn 1920–1933 Prohibition in the U.S. caused bowling alleys to disassociate from saloons, turning bowling into a family game and encouraging women bowlers.\nOn 2 October 1921, the annual Petersen Open Bowling Tournament (a.k.a. The Pete) was first held in Chicago, Illinois, becoming bowling's richest tournament of the day. In 1998, it was taken over by AMF.\nIn 1926, the International Bowling Association (IBA) was formed by the United States, Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, and Finland, holding four world championships by 1936.\nOn 21 March 1934, the National Bowling Writers Association was founded in Peoria, Illinois, by four bowling journalists; it changed its name in 1953 to the Bowling Writers Association of America.\nIn August 1939, the National Negro Bowling Association was founded in Detroit, Michigan, dropping Negro from the title in 1944 and opening membership to all races. It reached 30,000 members in 2007.\nIn 1942, the Bowling Proprietors Association of America (BPAA) held its first BPAA All-Star tournament.\nIn 1947, the Australian Women's Bowling Council was founded. It held the first Australian women's national lawn bowling championship in Sydney in 1949, which was won by Mrs. R. Cranley of Queensland.\nOn 18 April 1948, the Professional Women Bowling Writers (PWBW) was founded in Dallas, Texas, admitting men in 1975. On 1 January 2007, it merged with the Bowling Writers Association of America.\nIn 1950, following extensive lobbying by civil rights groups in the wake of the 1947 integration of Major League Baseball, the American Bowling Congress opened its membership to African Americans and other minorities. The WIBC followed suit the following year.\nAbout 1950, the Golden Age of Ten-Pin Bowling began, in which professional bowlers made salaries rivaling those of baseball, football, and hockey players; this ended in the late 1970s.\nIn 1951, the first ABC Masters tournament was held, becoming one of the four majors by 2000.\nIn 1952, the Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs (FIQ) was founded in Hamburg, West Germany, to coordinate international amateur competition in nine-pin and ten-pin bowling. In 1954, the first FIQ World Bowling Championships were held in Helsinki, Finland. In 1979, the International Olympic Committee recognized it as the official world governing body for bowling. Its name changed to World Bowling in 2014 and International Bowling Federation in 2020.\nIn 1952, American Machine and Foundry (AMF) of Brooklyn, New York, began marketing automatic Pinsetter machines. This eliminated the need for pinboys and caused bowling to rocket in popularity, making the 1950s the Decade of the Bowler.\nIn 1954, Steve Nagy (1913–1966) became the first person to bowl a perfect 300 game on TV on NBC-TV's \"Championship Bowling\". The PBA later named its sportsmanship award after him.\nIn 1958, the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) was founded in Akron, Ohio by 33 prominent bowlers (including Don Carter, Dick Weber, Dick Hoover, Buzz Fazio, Billy Welu, Carmen Salvino and Glenn Allison) after they listened to a presentation by sports agent Eddie Elias. The PBA eventually reached about 4,300 members in 14 countries worldwide. In 1975, Earl Anthony became the first PBA member with $100,000 yearly earnings, and the first to reach $1,000,000 total earnings in 1982. In 2000, it was purchased by former executives of Microsoft, who moved the PBA headquarters to Seattle, Washington.\nOn 28 November 1960, the first PBA Championship in Memphis, Tennessee was won by Don Carter. It was renamed the PBA World Championship in 2002, and now awarded the Earl Anthony Trophy to the winner.\nIn 1960, the Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) was founded as the first professional women's bowling association; it went defunct in 2003.\nIn 1960, the National Bowling League (NBL) was founded to compete with the PBA. It attracted name players such as Billy Welu and Buzz Fazio, but failed to sign top star Don Carter. The league's failure to get a TV contract caused it to fold following its first championship in 1962.\nOn 26 May 1961 the British Tenpin Bowling Association (BTBA) was formed. Their first General Secretary was Maurice Glazer. \nOn 27 January 1962, ABC Television aired its first Saturday afternoon broadcast of a PBA Tour event, the Empire State Open held at Redwood Lanes in Albany, New York, beginning a partnership between ABC and the PBA that lasted through 1997. The Saturday afternoon bowling telecasts garnered very good ratings through the early 1980s, until the cable television-fueled explosion of sports viewing choices caused ratings to decline.\nIn 1962, the first PBA Tournament of Champions was held; it became an annual event in 1965, and was sponsored by Firestone Tire from 1965 through 1993.\nIn 1962, the American Wheelchair Bowling Association (AWBA) was founded in Louisville, Kentucky, by Richard F. Carlson.\nOn 28 June 1963, The first British made tenpin was by H Massil and sons who received the permit no.1 from the British Tenpin Bowling Association (BTBA)\nBetween 3 and 10 November 1963, the Fifth FIQ World Bowling Championships in Mexico City, Mexico, were attended by 132 men and 45 women (first time) from 19 nations. It featured the debut of Team USA, which won seven of the eight gold medals.\nOn 25 November 1963, \"Sports Illustrated\" published the article \"A Guy Named Smith Is Striking It Rich\", revealing that PBA stars made more money than other professional sports stars, for \"with more than $1 million in prizes to shoot for, the nation's top professional bowlers are rolling in money.\" This was short-lived, however, for although the number of bowling alleys in the U.S. zoomed from 65,000 in 1957 to 160,000 in 1962, the U.S. bowling industry boom hit a brick wall in 1963. This was compensated, however, by a new boom in Europe and Japan, making 10-pin bowling an international sport.\nIn 1964, \"Mr. Bowling\" Don Carter became the first athlete to sign a $1 million endorsement contract: a multi-year deal with Ebonite International.\nIn 1964, Marion Ladewig, a nine-time winner of the Bowling Writers Association of America's Female Bowler of the Year Award, became the first Superior Performance inductee into the WIBC Hall of Fame.\nIn 1965, the AMF Bowling World Cup was established by the FIQ.\nOn 27 January 1967, the Japan Professional Bowling Association (JPBA) was founded in Tokyo, Japan.\nIn 1971, the BPAA All-Star tournament was renamed the BPAA U.S. Open, and officially became one of the PBA's major tournaments.\nIn 1978, National Negro Bowling Association pioneer J. Elmer Reed (1903–1983) became the first African-American to be inducted into the ABC Hall of Fame.\nOn 16 December 1979, Willie Willis won the Brunswick National Resident Pro Tournament in Charlotte, North Carolina, becoming the first African-American bowling champion in the PBA in a non-touring event. In 1980, he became the first African-American in the Firestone Tournament of Champions, placing 13th.\nOn 27 February 1982, Earl Anthony won the Toledo Trust PBA National Championship, becoming the first bowler to reach $1 million in career earnings.\nIn 1982, the Young American Bowling Alliance was formed from a merger of the American Junior Bowling Congress, the Youth Bowling Association, and the collegiate divisions of the ABC and WIBC.\nIn 1982, the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Australia, added women's bowls to the events.\nOn 1 July 1982, former PBA pro Glenn Allison rolled the first 900 series (three consecutive 300 games in a three-game set) to ever be submitted to the ABC for award consideration. The ABC, however, refused to certify the score, citing non-complying lane conditions.\nOn 22 November 1986, George Branham III (born 1962) became the first African-American to win a PBA national touring event: the Brunswick Memorial World Open in Chicago, Illinois.\nOn 18 September 1988, the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, featured ten-pin bowling as a demonstration sport.\nOn 2 August 1991, in Havana, Cuba, tenpin bowling became an international medal-level sport for the first time at the 1991 Pan American Games, and continues to this day.\nIn the 1992–1993 season, the ABC introduced resin bowling balls, causing perfect 300 scores to increase by 20%.\nIn 1995, the first Best Bowler ESPY Award was presented.\nIn 1995, the National Bowling Stadium opened in Reno, Nevada, becoming known as the Taj Mahal of Tenpins.\nOn 2 February 1997, Jeremy Sonnenfeld (born 1975) bowled the first officially sanctioned 900 series of three straight perfect 300 games at Sun Valley Lanes in Lincoln, Nebraska, becoming known as \"Mr. 900\".\nIn 1998, the World Tenpin Masters 10-pin bowling tournament was established.\nIn 2000, the Weber Cup, named after Dick Weber, was established as 10-pin bowling's equivalent to golf's Ryder Cup, with Team USA playing Team Europe in a three-day match.\nIn the 21st century.\nOn 31 March 2004, Missy Bellinder (born 1981) (later changing her name to Parkin) became the first female member of the PBA. The PBA had opened up its membership to women following the 2003 demise of the PWBA. One year later, Liz Johnson became the first woman to make the televised final round of a PBA Tour event.\nIn 2004, the Brunswick Euro Challenge was founded for amateur and pro 10-pin bowling players from Europe, Asia, and the U.S.\nOn 24 January 2010, Kelly Kulick (born 1977) became the first woman to win the PBA Tournament of Champions and the first woman to win a PBA national tour event.\nIn November 2012, after league bowling dropped from 80% to 20% of their business, AMF Bowling Centers of Richmond, Virginia filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time (first in 2001), merging in 2013 with upscale New York-based bowling center operator Bowlmor (which did not support league bowling) in an attempt to turn league bowling around, growing from 276 centers in 2013 to 315 in 2015.\nIn 2013, the PBA League was founded, composed of eight permanent five-person teams, with an annual draft.\nIn 2015, the Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) was revived after a 12-year hiatus.\nEquipment.\nBall.\nBowling balls vary, depending on the type of bowling. Ten-pin balls are about in diameter, typically have three holes, and weigh from . The size and spacing of the finger holes on non-customized balls are generally smaller on lighter balls to accommodate smaller hands. Modern resin covers (surfaces) available since the early 1990s enhance a ball's hook (curve) potential, and the shape of the balls' cores (pictured) permit fine-tuning of desired ball paths. In contrast, traditional plastic balls are suitable for straighter shots. Duckpin and candlepin balls fit in the palm of the hand, and have no holes.\nPins.\nBowling pins are the target of the bowling ball in pin bowling variations. The size and shape of pins vary but are generally cylindrical and widens where the ball strikes the pin. Ten-pin bowling pins are the largest and heaviest, weighing . Duckpins are shorter and squatter than standard tenpins and candlepins are the tallest at , but only wide and in weight.\nBowling pins are constructed by gluing blocks of rock maple wood into the approximate shape, and then turning on a lathe. After the lathe shapes the pin, it is coated with a plastic material, painted, and covered with a glossy finish. Because of the scarcity of suitable wood, bowling pins can be made from approved synthetics. Currently there are synthetic pins sanctioned for play in five-pin, duckpin, and candlepin. There is one synthetic ten-pin model approved by the USBC. When hit by the ball, synthetic pins usually sound different from wooden pins.\nThe USBC indicated that, effective August 1, 2023, it is certifying string pinsetters and string pin bowling as an independent category of equipment and competition separate from conventional free-fall pinsetters. USBC lab data indicated strike percentage on string pin bowling is 7.1% lower, causing the USBC to plan additional testing to determine whether a scoring conversion should be created between the categories. String pinsetters are less expensive and easier to maintain, motivating bowling centers to phase them in.\nShoes.\nThe sole of the non-sliding foot is generally made of rubber for traction, while the sliding foot's sole is made of a smooth material allowing a smooth slide into the release. Bowling shoes can be bought, and may be rented from bowling centers. Wet or dirty soles may not slide properly and could damage the approach surface.\nScoring.\nA standard game of ten-pin bowling consists of 10 frames, with a maximum of two rolls in each of the first nine frames and three in the tenth. A strike occurs when the bowler knocks down all 10 pins on the first roll; if this occurs in any of the first nine frames, the frame ends immediately without a second roll being taken. A spare occurs if the bowler leaves any pins standing after the first roll, then knocks them all down on the second. In any given frame, the bowler scores one point for every pin knocked down; a spare or strike awards one extra point for each pin knocked down on the next one or two rolls, respectively. In the tenth frame, the bowler gets one extra roll for making a spare, or two for a strike. The highest possible score for a single game is 300, achieved by rolling 12 consecutive strikes (a \"perfect game\").\nAccessibility.\nTechnological innovation has made bowling accessible to members of the disabled community.\nReferences.\nNotes"

As a senior at Tavares High School, Taylor averaged 25 points, 11 rebounds and 5 assists per game. He finished his senior year second in the Florida Class 3A Player of the Year voting and was named to the Florida Class 3A All-State First Team.\nTaylor also excelled on the gridiron as a wide receiver for Tavares, gaining 481 yards and 8 touchdowns as a senior. He turned down offers from Florida and South Florida to play basketball instead.\nIn addition to football and basketball, finished second in the Florida Class 2A Track and Field Championships in both the triple jump and high jump. He currently owns his high school's record for the long jump, high jump, and triple jump.\nAfter completing his high school career, Taylor signed a national letter of intent with UCF choosing the Knights over Pittsburgh, Alabama, and Penn State.\nCollegiate career.\nTaylor began his career at the University of Central Florida in 2005 during their first season in Conference USA. Taylor played in 15 games averaging 11 minutes and 4.3 points. In only his fourth collegiate game he scored 15 points in a winning effort against in-state opponent Bethune-Cookman. His best game as a freshman came during a home contest when he scored 16 points in 25 minutes of action in a 77-71 home loss.\nIn his sophomore campaign, he emerged as one UCF second leading scorer averaging 12.7 points, good for 16th in Conference USA. Taylor's prowess as a 3-point shooter was also evident during his second year for the Knights, draining 63 3s, averaging 41.4% behind the arc. Jermaine scored 26 points twice during his second year helping UCF to a 22-9 record and a 2-seed in the Conference USA tournament.\nTaylor first career start for the Knights came during his junior season, scoring 8 points in UCF's 63-60 win over University of Nevada in the inaugural game at the new UCF Arena.\nTaylor is a member of the Epsilon Eta chapter of Iota Phi Theta fraternity.\nProfessional career.\nTaylor declared for the 2009 NBA draft and was drafted 32nd overall by the Washington Wizards. He was later traded to the Houston Rockets for cash considerations.\nOn January 29, 2010, Taylor was assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Development League. On February 4, 2010, he was recalled by the Houston Rockets after scoring 32 and 30 in two games with the Vipers. He was sent back to the Vipers on February 19, 2010, but recalled four days later, and then returned to the Vipers on March 17, 2010. Taylor was recalled by the Rockets once again on March 24, 2010. He then had his first career start in a game versus the Los Angeles Lakers on March 27, 2010, in which he scored 15 points.\nOn December 15, 2010, Taylor was traded to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for a protected second-round pick. He was waived by the Kings at the end of the season.\nIn September 2012, Taylor signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. However, he did not make the team's final roster.\nOn November 8, 2012, Taylor signed with the Spanish League team San Sebastián Gipuzkoa BC. In January 2013, he joined Hapoel Tel Aviv B.C. Later that month, he joined Shanxi Zhongyu of China.\nOn March 15, 2013, Taylor was acquired by the Maine Red Claws. In September 2013, he joined the Cleveland Cavaliers for training camp. He was later waived on October 25. On October 31, 2013, he was reacquired by the Maine Red Claws. On November 29, 2013, he was waived by the Red Claws due to a season-ending knee injury just two games into the season.\nOn October 31, 2014, Taylor was again reacquired by the Maine Red Claws. On January 22, 2015, he was traded to the Idaho Stampede in exchange for the returning player rights to Dallas Lauderdale. On April 28, 2015, he signed with the Canterbury Rams for the rest of the 2015 New Zealand NBL season. He made his debut for the Rams four days later and recorded 7 points and 3 assists off the bench in a loss to the Super City Rangers. In 11 games for Canterbury, he averaged 15.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.2 steals per game.\nOn August 15, 2015, Taylor signed with Dominican club Centro Juvenil Don Bosco. However, his stint lasted just three days after falling to score in his debut game on August 17. On October 31, he was acquired by the Salt Lake City Stars of the NBA Development League."

        "title": "Challenge Cup",
        "text": "The Rugby Football League Challenge Cup, commonly known just as the Challenge Cup is a knockout rugby league cup competition organised by the Rugby Football League, held annually since 1896, it is the world's oldest cup competition in either code of rugby. A concurrent Women's Challenge Cup and Wheelchair Challenge Cup have been held since 2012 and 2015 respectively.\nThe competition is open to all eligible clubs down to Tier 5. Some amateur clubs have to qualify to enter in Round One while others can apply through the RFL to enter.\nThe final is traditionally played at Wembley Stadium although it has been played at other venues Wembley is seen as the home of the competition. \"Abide with Me\", sung before the game, has become a rugby league anthem.\nThe current holders of the Challenge Cup are Leigh Leopards, winning the competition for the third time, beating Hull Kingston Rovers 17-16 in the 2023 Final on 12 August 2023 at Wembley Stadium. The 2023 final was also the first to feature the Women's Challenge Cup showpiece at Wembley on the same day.\nWigan are the most successful club in the history of the competition, winning the Cup a record 20 times.\nHistory.\nThe clubs that formed the Northern Union had long been playing in local knock-out cup competitions under the auspices of the Rugby Football Union. The rugby union authorities refused to sanction a nationwide tournament, however, fearing that this would inevitably lead to professionalism. After the schism of 1895, the northern clubs were free to go ahead, and they started the Northern Rugby Football Union Challenge Cup. In 1896 Fattorini's of Bradford were commissioned to manufacture the Challenge Cup at a cost of just £60. Fattorini's also supplied three-guineas winners' medals then valued at thirty shillings (£1.50).\nThe first competition was held during the 1896–97 season (the second season of the new game), and 52 clubs entered to compete for the trophy. The first final was held at Headingley in Leeds, on 24 April 1897. Batley defeated St. Helens 10–3 in front of a crowd of 13,492 (\"see picture\"). The St Helens side did not play in a standardised team jersey.\nThe competition was later interrupted by the Great War, although it was held in 1915, when the season that had begun before the war was completed. It was then suspended until the end of hostilities. Initially, the final tie was held at one of the larger club grounds in the north, however, noting the excitement in Huddersfield that the town's football team were playing at Wembley in the FA Cup Final and the increasing difficulty for any of the rugby league grounds to satisfy spectator demand to see the final tie, the rugby league authorities voted 13–10 to move to the recently built Wembley Stadium in London, aiming to emulate the FA Cup's success and to put the game on the national stage.\nThe first final held at Wembley was in 1929 when Wigan beat Dewsbury 13–2 in front of a crowd of 41,500. The final was subsequently held at Wembley in 1930 &amp; 31 but switched to Central Park in Wigan in 1932 as Wembley was not booked by the games administrators.\nAt the start of the Second World War, rugby league suspended its season immediately, but the Challenge Cup took a single year's break before restarting, on a limited basis and with the support of the authorities, as part of keeping up morale. The Challenge Cup finals, which took place in the game's Northern heartland, got big crowds as the game raised money for prisoners of war and for Lord Beaverbrook's armaments programme.\nIn 1946, the Lance Todd Trophy was introduced and awarded to the man of the match. The first winner was Billy Stott of Wakefield Trinity while the first winner of the trophy on the losing team was Frank Whitcombe of Bradford Northern in 1948. In itself, it is a prestigious trophy presented only at the Challenge Cup Final. The winner is selected by the members of the Rugby League Writers' Association present at the game and the trophy was presented at a celebratory dinner at the Willows, the home of Salford.\nThe post World War Two Final crowds almost immediately reached capacity at Wembley – which amounted to multiple 90,000 plus crowds.\n1954 saw the Challenge Cup final drawn and the replay set the record for a rugby league match attendance. The match was on 5 May and 102,569 was the official attendance at Odsal Stadium, although it is believed that up to 120,000 spectators were present to see Warrington defeat Halifax 8–4.\nThe first final that was played under limited tackle rules (Originally 4, later changed to 6) Was the 1967 final between Barrow and Featherstone Rovers.\nWigan became well known for their successes in the Challenge Cup competition, winning every Challenge Cup Final from 1988 to 1995.\nUntil the 1993–94 season there were very few amateur clubs included in the cup, typically two. For part of the 1980s, and the 1992–93 season the cup was solely for professional clubs. The competition was then opened up to large numbers of amateur clubs as part of a deal between the Rugby Football League and British Amateur Rugby League Association over bridging the gap between the professional and amateur leagues.\nIn 1997, a Challenge Cup Plate took place for teams knocked out in the early rounds of the competition. The final took place at Wembley and was won by Hull Kingston Rovers who beat Hunslet 60–14.\nThe first final that featured use of the Video Referee, for try decisions, was the 1999 final between Leeds Rhinos and , which saw the Broncos beaten by a record margin of 52–16 in a Challenge Cup Final.\nThe 1999 Challenge Cup Final was also the last to be played at the old Wembley Stadium before the construction of the new Wembley Stadium began in 2003. During this time a variety of venues were used to hold the Final including Twickenham, Murrayfield and the Millennium Stadium. The Challenge Cup Final moved back into the new Wembley Stadium for the 2007 Final.\nThere was a belief that the Challenge Cup final taking place early in the season had led to a decline in the prestige of the cup, so the timing of the competition was altered in 2005\nOn 26 August 2006 St. Helens scrum-half Sean Long became the first player in the history of the Challenge Cup to collect a third Lance Todd trophy following his man-of-the-match performance in the final against Huddersfield. His other Lance Todd trophy wins came in the 2001 and 2004 Challenge Cup Finals.\nOn 25 August 2018, Catalans Dragons became the first non-English team to win the Challenge Cup as they defeated Warrington Wolves 20–14 at Wembley.\nFormat.\nThe modern Challenge Cup has eight rounds prior to the final. Teams are seeded, entering at different stages. The precise format has altered slightly from year to year, however the current format is as follows:\nVenues.\nDuring the first round right through to the quarter-finals the cup is hosted at the stadium of the team who has been drawn at home. The semi finals are hosted at neutral venues so there is no advantage for the home team. \nThe final is played at Wembley traditionally, having first been played there in 1929. Before, the final had been held in different neutral venues, mostly in the north of England. The first Challenge Cup final was held at Headingley, Leeds between Batley and St. Helens in front of a crowd of 13,492.\nTrophy.\nThe Challenge Cup trophy was designed by silversmiths Fattorini &amp; Sons of Bradford in 1897. The trophy stands 36 inches high, manufactured of solid silver and sits on a black ebony base approximately 8 inches deep.\nTony Collins, the Rugby Football League's archivist, stated in 2007 that, \"Fattorini's weren't given any particular commission, just told to come up with something prestigious\". The trophy cost £60. The average wage in 1897 was around £2 per week which suggests an equivalent 2007 price of £16,000, although Collins says, \"if you wanted something made of silver and with that level of craftsmanship these days, it would be far more expensive. In terms of its subsequent value, the RFL got a bargain.\"\nThe trophy currently presented to the winners after the final is not the original which had to be withdrawn due to its delicate condition. As well as the silver wearing thin, it had lost its fluted top and the players on each of the handles had been damaged. The original Fattorini trophy was last presented at the 2001 Challenge Cup Final to St Helens captain Chris Joynt after his team had beaten Bradford. The original trophy is now stored at the RFL's headquarters at Red Hall and only used for promotional appearances.\nThe trophy used today was created by Jack Spencer (goldsmith) of Sheffield in 800 man-hours and is an almost exact replica of the Fattorini piece. One improvement made with the new version is that the small shields displaying each winning team and captain are now the same size, whereas they had been getting smaller as space ran out on the original. The new trophy's neck has been strengthened. The second trophy was first presented to Wigan, winners of the 2002 Challenge Cup Final.\nThe winners of the cup in looking after the trophy must \"follow a certain code of practice,\" says Collins. When not in a secure cabinet, the trophy must always be in the presence of someone. When the trophy is taken out overnight, somebody must sleep in the same room and if taken in a car there must be two people in attendance. Collins reveals that, \"When it went down to France for some Catalans publicity photos, it even had its own seat on the plane.\"\nAwards.\nThe Lance Todd Trophy, named in memory of Lance Todd, is awarded to the man-of-the-match in the Challenge Cup Final. The winner is decided each year by those members of the Rugby League Writers' Association present at the match.\nThe Trophy was first presented in 1946 to William \"Billy\" Stott of Wakefield Trinity.\nSponsorship.\nThe Challenge Cup has been sponsored since 1980, with the sponsor being able to determine the cup's sponsorship name. There have been eight sponsors with Betfred being the current sponsors.\nThe official rugby ball supplier is Steeden.\nNotable events in finals.\nThe most tries scored in a final was 5 scored by Tom Briscoe (Leeds Rhinos v Hull KR in 2015), who also holds the record for most tries in total from one player (7 for Leeds, 2014 – 1, 2015 – 5, 2020 – 1) one ahead of Kevin Iro (6 for Wigan, 1988 – 2, 1989 – 2, 1990 – 2).\nThe first hat trick of tries in a final was scored by Robbie Paul for Bradford Bulls v St Helens in 1996. Three years later, Leroy Rivett scored 4 for Leeds Rhinos against London Broncos in 1999. Some players previously missed out on becoming the first to score a hat trick due to tries being disallowed, such as Martin Offiah (Wigan v Castleford in 1992), Tony Iro (Wigan v Halifax in 1988) &amp; Kevin Iro (Wigan v Warrington in 1990).\nGraham Rees scored the quickest Challenge Cup Final try after just 35 seconds for St Helens against Leeds in 1972.\nThe most famous final was the 1968 'Watersplash' game between Leeds and Wakefield Trinity. Due to a heavy thunderstorm both before and during the match, the pitch became totally waterlogged. In the final minute, with Leeds 11 – 7 in front, Wakefield winger Ken Hurst scored under the posts, and Don Fox (Who had already won the Lance Todd Trophy that day) had a match winning conversion to take in injury time. But due to the saturated pitch, he miskicked the ball, sending it wide of the posts. Despite a successful career for both club and country, Fox has always been remembered for that one infamous moment.\nThe first player to be sent off in a final was Syd Hynes, for Leeds against Leigh in 1971, for headbutting Alex Murphy. Hynes has always protested his innocence over the incident. Richard Eyres of Widnes was shown a red card for an off the ball elbow on Martin Offiah of Wigan in the 1993 final, and was banned for 6 games as a result.\nThe first final to be decided by golden point was in 2023 with Leigh Leopards scoring a drop goal against Hull KR via Lachlan Lam. 2023 also saw the first occasion of the Women's Challenge Cup final featuring at Wembley Stadium, prior to the men's final.\nChallenge Cup Finals.\nIn total, 26 different clubs have won the Challenge Cup and 30 different teams have appeared in the final. Wigan Warriors hold the record for most wins with 20 and have appeared in 33 finals. In 2007, Catalans Dragons became the first non English team to reach the final but lost to St. Helens.\nThe Double.\nIn British Rugby League, the term \"The Double\" refers to the achievement of a club that wins the Super League (Rugby Football League Championship First Division before 1996) and Challenge Cup in the same season. To date, this has been achieved by ten different clubs.\nThe Treble.\n\"The Treble\" refers to the team who wins all three domestic honours on offer during the season; Grand Final, League Leaders' Shield, and Challenge Cup. To date seven teams have won the treble, only Bradford, St. Helens and Leeds have won the treble in the Super League era.\nThe Quadruple.\n\"The Quadruple\" (not an official name) refers to winning the Super League, League Leaders' Shield, Challenge Cup and World Club Challenge in one season.\nNote: Since the switch to summer rugby, the Word Club Challenge can only be won the season after the treble.\nAll Four Cups.\nWinning all Four Cups referred to winning the RFL First Division Championship, Challenge Cup, County League and County Cup in one season.\nBroadcast.\nThe BBC first covered the final of this competition when Wigan beat Bradford Northern in 1948. At that time though the only TV transmitter was in London, so fans up North never got to see it. It was another four years before another final was covered when Workington Town beat Featherstone Rovers in 1952. The cup final was not broadcast on TV again until the 1958 final between Wigan and Workington Town since when it has been shown every year. The inception of \"Grandstand\" also saw coverage of earlier rounds start to be shown during the 1960s with ITV's \"World of Sport\" even showing games as well for a short period.\nThe BBC has been the predominant broadcaster, showing every final live since 1958 (except the 1982 Final Replay shown as highlights). Eddie Waring was the first commentator for BBC coverage. When he retired, commentary was covered by Ray French and he continued to work for the BBC for a number of years, albeit in semi-retirement, with his last Challenge Cup Final in 2008. From 2009, the present day main commentator is Dave Woods. He usually commentates with Brian Noble, Jonathan Davies, Iestyn Harris or Ian Millward. Nowadays, the BBC continues to broadcast the tournament with Clare Balding hosting from 2006 to 2012 until her move to Channel 4 Racing. Mark Chapman was secondary host in 2012 when Balding was unavailable for the cup and international matches, and previous hosts for the BBC include John Inverdale and Steve Rider. The current main hosts (as of 2013) are Mark Chapman and Super League Show presenter Tanya Arnold.\nFrom 2012–2021, Sky Sports held the rights for the early rounds with one match each round and two quarter finals; whilst BBC Sport showed two sixth round matches, two quarter finals, both semi-finals and the final.\nFrom 2022 onwards, Premier Sports will begin to broadcast games from the fourth round up to the quarter-finals alongside BBC.\nExternal links.\n "

        "title": "Clay Smith (baseball)",
        "text": "Clay Jamieson Smith (September 11, 1914 – March 5, 2002) was an American professional baseball pitcher who appeared in 18 games in Major League Baseball over two seasons for the Cleveland Indians (four games in 1938) and Detroit Tigers (14 contests in 1940). A member of the Kansas Baseball Hall of Fame, he hurled in one game of the 1940 World Series for the Tigers. During his playing career, he batted and threw right-handed, stood tall, and weighed .\nSmith was born in Cambridge, in Cowley County, Kansas. He is one of three major leaguers (through 2022) out of Southwestern College of Winfield, Kansas, also in Cowley County. He was on the baseball, basketball, wrestling and track teams in college, and is a member of the college's basketball hall of fame.\nBaseball career.\nHe began pitching in the minors for the Fargo–Moorhead Twins of the Class D Northern League in 1935 and 1936, posting a 15–5 won–lost record in the latter year. After going 16–13 in 1937 for Springfield, Ohio, in the Middle Atlantic League, he was promoted in 1938 to Wilkes–Barre of the Class A Eastern League, where he went 8–14 with an earned run average of 3.35.\nSmith was recalled to Cleveland late in the season and made his major league debut on September 13, 1938, throwing two innings of relief against the eventual 1938 world champion New York Yankees.\nSmith spent 1939 with the Buffalo Bisons of the top-tier International League, where he led the team in victories (13). A teammate was the 21-year-old Lou Boudreau, a future Baseball Hall of Fame shortstop, who hit .331. The Detroit Tigers then purchased Smith's contract and sent him to the Beaumont Exporters of the Texas League for 1940. Over the first 2 months of the season, Smith compiled a 12–5 record and a sparkling 2.31 earned run average in 23 games pitched, earning him a mid-year callup. In his first Detroit appearance, on July 13, 1940, at Griffith Stadium, he hurled 2 scoreless innings in relief of Tommy Bridges against the Washington Senators for his first (and only) MLB win as Detroit rallied from a 3–1 deficit to nip Washington, 4–3.\nWorld Series appearance.\nEach win was precious for the 1940 Tigers, as they battled Smith's old Cleveland club to the wire in a thrilling American League pennant race. Smith's 14 total games for Detroit included one start, an 8–5 defeat on July 17 against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, and 13 relief appearances. By season's end, he had posted a mediocre 5.08 earned run average, five games finished, and no saves, as the Tigers edged the Indians by one game to win the AL title. Smith was on the Tigers' roster for the 1940 World Series against the National League champion Cincinnati Reds. Detroit led the Series, two games to one, going into Game 4 on October 5, 1940, at Briggs Stadium. But starter Dizzy Trout was ineffective: he surrendered three runs on six hits, and left the game in the third frame with runners on second and third base and none out. Called upon to stanch the bleeding by manager Del Baker, Smith retired Jimmie Wilson, Eddie Joost and Paul Derringer to keep the score 3–0, Cincinnati. He went on to pitch a total of four full innings, allowing only one hit and one run, before he exited the game for a pinch hitter in the sixth inning with the Tigers trailing, 4–2. The Reds would win the contest, 5–2, to tie the Series, and eventually triumph in Game 7 to capture the world championship.\nThe World Series outing was Smith's last major-league appearance. In his 18 total regular season games, he split two decisions with nine games finished, no saves, and an earned run average of 5.49; in 39 innings pitched, he allowed 50 hits, 15 bases on balls, and 24 earned runs, with 17 strikeouts. But, in his stellar Fall Classic appearance against the Reds, Smith posted a 2.25 ERA, allowing three walks but only one hit and one earned run.\nSmith returned to the minors in 1941, pitching for the St. Paul Saints through 1943. After baseball, he was a rancher and mail carrier, and worked a farm north of Cambridge until he was 71 years old. He died in Winfield in 2002, aged 87."

        "title": "Don Bradman with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Don Bradman toured England in 1948 with an Australian cricket team that went undefeated in their 34 tour matches, including the five Ashes Tests. Bradman was the captain, one of three selectors, and overall a dominant figure of what was regarded as one of the finest teams of all time, earning the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\".\nGenerally regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket, the right-handed Bradman played in all five Tests as captain at No. 3. Bradman was more influential than other Australian captains because he was also one of the three selectors who had a hand in choosing the squad. He was also a member of the Australian Board of Control while still playing, a privilege that no other person has held. At the age of 40, Bradman was by far the oldest player on the team; three-quarters of his team were at least eight years younger, and some viewed him as a father figure. Coupled with his status as a national hero, cricketing ability and influence as an administrator, this associated the team more closely to him than other teams to their respective captains. Bradman's iconic stature as a cricketer also led to record-breaking public interest and attendances at the matches on tour.\nBradman ended the first-class matches atop the batting aggregates and averages, with 2428 runs at 89.92, and eleven centuries, the most by any player. Despite his success, his troubles against Alec Bedser's leg trap—he fell three consecutive times in the Tests and twice in other matches to bowlers using this ploy—were the subject of much discussion.\nBradman scored 138 in the first innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge, laying the foundation for Australia's 509, which set up a lead of 344 and eventual victory. In the Fourth Test at Headingley, he scored an unbeaten 173 on a deteriorating pitch on the final day, combining in a triple-century partnership with Arthur Morris as Australia scored 3/404 in the second innings to win by seven wickets. This set a world record for the highest ever successful run-chase in Test history. The tour was Bradman's international farewell, and when needing only four runs for a Test career average of exactly 100, he bowed out with a second ball duck in the Fifth Test at The Oval, bowled by an Eric Hollies googly. Australia nevertheless won the Test to complete a 4–0 series win, and Bradman ended the series with 508 runs at 72.57, with two centuries. Only Morris—with three centuries—scored more runs in the five Tests. Bradman's Test average for the series was the third-highest among the Australians, behind that of Sid Barnes and Morris.\nBackground.\nBradman had almost opted out of the tour, citing business commitments in Australia; at the time, it was not possible to make a living from cricket. Prior to the campaign in England, Australia hosted India for a five-Test series during the southern hemisphere summer of 1947–48. Australia easily defeated the tourists 4–0, and Bradman and his fellow selectors Chappie Dwyer and Jack Ryder thus began planning for the tour of England. Bradman made it publicly known that he wanted his team to become the first to play an English summer without defeat. England had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, instead of the previous rule of after 200 runs had been scored. As the run rate was generally much slower than 3.64, 55 overs would usually elapse long before 200 runs were scored. This meant that the ball was in a shiny state more often, and thereby more conducive to fast and swing bowling. Bradman and his colleagues thus chose the team with an emphasis on strong batting and fast bowling, basing his strategy on an intense speed attack against England's batsmen. His 17-man squad sailed for England and arrived in mid-April.\nEarly tour.\nAustralia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire at the end of April. Bradman thus captained against Worcestershire with Australia bowling first and dismissing the hosts for 233. After Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris put on a partnership of 79 runs in 99 minutes, Bradman came in at No. 3 and put on a stand of 186 in 152 minutes with Morris, before falling for 107, having hit 15 fours. Morris narrowly beat Bradman to score Australia's first century on tour, reaching triple figures while Bradman's score was on 99. Bradman declared Australia's innings at 7/462 and the hosts fell for 212 to complete an Australian victory by an innings and 17 runs.\nIn the next match, against Leicestershire, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, promoting Keith Miller ahead of himself to No. 3. As Miller came out to bat, the large crowd mobbed the players' entrance only to see that Bradman was not batting in his customary position. Bradman came to the crease at 2/157, and after initially being troubled by the left-arm unorthodox spin of Australian expatriate Jack Walsh, added 159 with Miller before falling for 81. Australia compiled 448 and bowled out the home side for 130 and 147 to win by an innings, with Bradman taking one catch.\nThe Australians then proceeded to play Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Bradman rested himself and returned to London, so his deputy Lindsay Hassett led the team. Yorkshire were bowled out in difficult batting conditions for 71, before Australia replied with 101. The hosts were then bowled out for 89. Chasing 60 for victory, the Australian top order collapsed to 6/31. Neil Harvey and Don Tallon survived a dropped catch and a stumping opportunity, before seeing Australia home by four wickets. It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour.\nBradman then returned in the next match against Surrey at The Oval in London, winning the toss and electing to bat. The last time Australia had played at the ground was the Fifth Test in 1938, when England declared at a world record score of 7/903; Bradman had hurt his ankle, and was unable to bat as Australia fell to the largest defeat in Test history. This match was a far different experience for the Australians. Barnes and Morris put on 136 before Bradman came in to join Barnes; together they added another 207 before Barnes fell for 176. Bradman started slowly and was heckled by the crowd for taking 80 minutes to reach 50, but accelerated and went on to score 146 before being dismissed at 3/403, with Australia proceeding to be all out for 632. He had attacked the medium pacers with his pull shot, but had some difficulties reading the left arm wrist spin of Australian expatriate John McMahon, nearly being caught behind the wicket on multiple occasions. Australia then bowled Surrey out for 141 and 195 to win by an innings.\nBradman rested himself for the next match against Cambridge University, leaving Hassett to orchestrate another innings victory. Bradman returned for the following match against Essex, and batted first after winnings the toss. Bill Brown opened with Barnes and they put on 145 in 97 minutes before Barnes hit his own wicket and was out. Bradman came in and seized the initiative, reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch, including five fours from one over by Frank Vigar which subsequently entered Essex club folklore, as Australia passed 200. Bradman and Brown put on a second-wicket partnership of 219 in 90 minutes before Brown was out for 153 from three hours of batting, with the score at 2/364. After Miller fell without scoring on the next ball, Ron Hamence joined Bradman and they put on another 88 before the Australian skipper was out for 187 at 4/452. Bradman had added his last 87 runs in 48 minutes, hitting a total of 32 fours. Australia was out for 721 at stumps, setting a world record for the most runs in a single day's play in first-class cricket; the record still stands. The tourists completed victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the tour. Bradman rested himself for the next match against Oxford University, which resulted in another innings victory.\nThe next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in late-May. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. Bradman captained the team and batted at No. 3. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team would line up for Australia in the First Test, with the top six batsmen playing in the same positions. It was a chance for both teams to gain a psychological advantage. Australia won the toss and batted but stumbled early. Morris was out for five and Bradman came in to join Barnes at 1/11. The pair added 160 before Barnes fell and Hassett came in to join his captain. They took the score to 200 before the Bradman fell for 98, leaving Australia at 3/200. It was Bradman's highest score under 100 in first-class cricket and in his disappointment, he was slow to leave the ground after his dismissal. Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings, with Bradman catching his opposite number Norman Yardley in the second innings. Up to this point, Bradman had played in five of the first eight matches, all of which were won, seven by an innings. He had scored 107, 81, 146, 187 and 98, yielding a total of 619 runs at an average of 123.80.\nThe MCC match was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, against Lancashire. Australia were sent in to bat and dismissed for 204, with Bradman bowled by an arm ball from Malcolm Hilton for 11, his first score on the tour below 80. The hosts replied with 182 and in the second innings, Bradman was again dismissed by Hilton, this time for 43 as the tourists reached 4/259 at the end of play. When Hilton came on, Bradman attempted to seize the initiative and hit him out of the attack, but missed his first two balls. On the third ball, he charged out of his crease and swung across the line, missed, fell over and was stumped. Hilton's achievement garnered widespread press attention, particularly in Lancashire.\nIn the following match against Nottinghamshire, the hosts batted first and made 179. Bradman joined Brown at 1/32 and they took the score to 197 when Bradman fell for 86. The tourists reached 400 and the hosts ended at 8/299 in the second innings to hang on for a draw. Bradman rested himself for the next fixture against Hampshire, and Australia were dismissed for 117 on a drying pitch in reply to the home side's 195, the first time they had conceded a first innings lead in the tour. Australia would have been in deeper trouble but for a flurry of sixes by Miller. Hampshire were then bowled out for 103 to leave Australia a target of 182, and this time the tourists batted with much more authority to seal an eight-wicket win. The tourists had survived another tight battle under the leadership of Hassett. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex. Australia skittled the hosts for 86 before Morris and Brown put on an opening stand of 153. Bradman then joined Morris, and gave two early chances. He was dropped on two and escaped a stumping on 25. He and Morris put on 189 before the latter fell for 184. Bradman then ended his Test preparation by reaching 109, in 124 minutes with 12 fours, and declaring at 5/549, before completing another innings victory.\nFirst Test.\nAustralia headed into the First Test at Trent Bridge starting on 10 June with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, with eight innings victories. It was thought that Bradman would play a specialist leg spinner, but he changed his mind on the first morning when rain was forecast. Bill Johnston, a left-arm paceman and orthodox spinner, was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket. This was the only change from the teams that Australia had fielded in the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting apart from some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour, as the surface of the pitch had become moist following overnight rain, assisting seam bowling. Australia's selection policy meant that their reserve opener Brown would bat out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, while Neil Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.\nDespite an injury to pace spearhead Ray Lindwall, Bradman's fast bowlers reduced England in their first innings to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165. Bradman dropped two catches in this innings. English gloveman Godfrey Evans came to the crease with the score at 6/60, and hit Johnston hard to cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second chance went through Bradman's hand and struck him in the abdomen. However, these missed catches did not cost Australia much, as Evans was soon caught at short leg by Morris close in, leaving England at 7/74. England managed to recover somewhat after Laker and Bedser added 89 runs in only 73 minutes for the ninth wicket. At first, Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership, and it was surmised that he may have been happy for England to continue batting so that his top order would not have to bat in fading light towards the end of the afternoon, but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable.\nOn the second day, Morris fell at 1/73 and Bradman came in to join Barnes. Yardley set a defensive field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. He packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Alec Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. While Jim Laker stopped the scoring at the other end, Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. At the other end, Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently as he had done in the past.\nThe score progressed to 121 when Barnes fell to Laker. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to Australia's total. The hard-hitting Miller had come in at No. 4, a position usually occupied by the more sedate Hassett, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed. All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would throughout the day. Brown came in, but he looked unaccustomed to batting in the middle order. The Australian captain decided to hasten the new ball by using his feet to get to the pitch of the ball to attack the spinners, hitting them through the off side. Yardley took the second new ball, but this move backfired as Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes, and in the first 40 minutes after lunch, 43 runs were added. Yardley then took the second new ball. Bradman struck his first boundary in more than 80 minutes but the run rate remained low. Australia passed England's total before Yardley brought himself on to bowl and removed Brown. This ended a 64-run stand with Bradman in 58 minutes, and Hassett came in at 4/185. Following the departure of Brown, the Australian scoring slowed as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once.\nYardley continued to employ a leg side field, as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then put his hands on his hips. During the 15 minutes before the tea break, Bradman did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd for his lack of scoring. The Australian captain reached the tea break on 78; 55 minutes after the resumption of play he played a cover drive against Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes. It was his 28th Test century, and his 18th in Ashes Tests; the last 29 runs took 70 minutes. It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets. Nevertheless, Bradman had appeared comfortable after the early stages of his innings, and patiently scored most of his runs between mid-off and mid-on, often from the back foot. After the Australian captain had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen. Bradman added a further 30 in the last hour to end with 130. Australia batted to stumps on the second day without further loss, ending at 4/293, a lead of 128.\nAfter the day's play, former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly and former teammate of Bradman, then a journalist, consulted Bedser on his use of leg theory. O'Reilly had much experience in attacking leg stump in his career and helped Bedser refine his leg trap plan to ensnare Bradman.\nOn the third morning, amid sunshine, Bradman resumed on 130, before progressing to 132 and becoming the first player to pass 1,000 runs for the English season. The Australian captain was not aware of the reason for the spontaneous crowd applause until notified by wicket-keeper Evans. Bedser was bowling and soon implemented O'Reilly's variation of the leg trap. Hutton was moved from leg-slip to a squarer position at short fine leg, around 11 metres from the bat. Two short legs and a mid on were put in place. Bradman drove Bedser through cover for a boundary, but on the next ball, his innings was terminated at 138 when he glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg, where he caught the ball without having to move. Bradman had batted for 290 minutes and faced 321 balls and Johnson replaced him with Australia at 5/305. Bedser waved to O'Reilly in the press box. When former Australian Test cricketer and journalist Jack Fingleton reported what his friend and former team-mate O'Reilly had done, there was some debate in the media as to whether O'Reilly's actions in advising Bedser were treacherous. Australia went on to end on 509 and take a 344-run first innings lead.\nAlthough Lindwall was able to run between the wickets during Australia's innings, he did not take the field in the second innings and the 12th man Neil Harvey replaced him. However, Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but did not approach Bradman to object to Harvey's presence on the field. O'Reilly said that as Lindwall demonstrated his mobility during his innings, he was in no way \"incapacitated\" and that the English captain \"must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far\" when no substitute was justified.\nAfter lunch on day four, with England on 3/191, the light was poor with clouds gathering, although England did not appeal against it. Yardley wanted to bat in poor visibility so that he could build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman thought that rain might come so he utilised Ernie Toshack and Ian Johnson to bowl defensively with a leg side field so that England would not have a lead should rain and a sticky wicket arise. \"Wisden\" opined that \"rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day\". Fingleton said the conditions were \"pitiable\" and \"utmost gloom in which batsmen and fieldsmen had intense difficulty in sighting the ball\". Australia eventually finished off the hosts' second innings for 441, leaving them a target of 98 on the final afternoon. Late in England's innings, Bradman raised eyebrows by deliberately giving centurion Denis Compton easy singles by spreading his fielders in order to bring Evans on strike so that he could be targeted. Compton thought that Evans could be relied upon and readily accepted the runs gifted to him by the Australian captain, and Evans continued to play confidently, eventually reaching 50.\nAustralia proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell. Bradman came to the crease and stayed 12 minutes without getting off the mark. He was out for a duck from the 10th ball that he faced, caught again by Hutton at short fine leg in Bedser's leg trap. Bradman showed obvious displeasure at allowing himself to be dismissed by the same trap in consecutive innings, and his departure left Australia at 48/2. It was the first time in four tours to England that Bradman had made a duck in a Test. This left Australia 2/48, but they reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting.\nBetween Tests, Bradman rested himself during the match against Northamptonshire, which started the day after the Test, as Hassett led Australia to victory by an innings. He returned for the match against Yorkshire. Bradman came in at 1/0 when Barnes fell for a duck and top-scored with 54 as Australia made 249. Bradman pulled many short balls and reached 50 in 76 minutes. After the hosts replied with 209, Bradman came in at 1/17 and put on 154 for the second wicket with Brown, ending with 86 as the match petered into a draw. His innings ended when Hutton caught him in the leg trap. Not wanting to tire his bowlers before the Second Test that started the day after next, Bradman showed little intent to win the match. The batsmen batted unhurriedly and set Yorkshire 329 for victory with only 70 minutes of play remaining and the hosts ended at 4/85. Yardley expressed his displeasure by allowing his part-timers to bowl and then promoting tail-enders to the upper half of the batting order in the second innings. The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators.\nSecond Test.\nBradman opted to field an unchanged lineup for the Second Test, which started on 24 June at Lord's. Following his injury in the previous Test, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover. Miller played, but was unfit to bowl.\nBarnes fell for a duck in his second over, bringing Bradman to the crease at 1/3. Bradman received a loud reception from the crowd as he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's. Bradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Alec Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving an appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling from the other end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and the ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first twenty minutes as Australia had only 14 after the first half-hour. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.\nEdrich came on and bowled a bouncer, which Bradman tried to swing to the leg side, but instead the edge went in the air and landed behind point. On 13, Bradman played a Bedser ball from his legs, narrowly evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour he was on 14. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Doug Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. At the lunch break, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. Shortly afterwards, in the third over after the resumption of play, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught for 38 for the third consecutive time in Tests by Hutton off Bedser at short fine leg, just two days after falling the same way in the second innings against Yorkshire. According to O'Reilly, this was evidence that Bradman was no longer the player he was before World War II, as he had been unable to disperse the close-catching fielders by counter-attacking, before eventually being dismissed. O'Reilly said that this was the first time that Bradman had fallen to the same trap three times in succession. Australia reached 7/258 at the end of day one, before a lower order burst took them to 350 on the second morning.\nEngland then started their reply, and Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. Seeing that Lindwall was able to bowl through the pain, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller for the second over to see if Miller could bowl. However, Miller threw the ball back, indicating that his body would not be able to withstand it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.\nAlthough Bradman claimed that the exchange had been amicable, others disputed this. Teammate Barnes later claimed that Miller had retorted by suggesting that Bradman—a very occasional slower bowler—bowl himself. Barnes said that the captain \"was as wild as a battery-stung brumby\" and warned his unwilling bowler that there would be consequences for his defiance. According to unpublished writings in Fingleton's personal collection, Bradman chastised his players in the dressing room at the end of the play, saying \"I'm 40 and I can do my full day's work in the field.\" Miller reportedly snapped \"So would I—if I had fibrositis\"; Bradman had been discharged from the armed services during World War II on health grounds, whereas most of the team had been sent into battle. Miller had crash-landed while serving as a fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force in England and had suffered chronic back trouble since then.\nOn the second afternoon, Bradman delayed the taking of the second new ball until after tea so that Lindwall and Johnston could have an extra period of recuperation before a new attack. This proved dividends as the bowlers took a wicket apiece within three overs of the new ball being taken, leaving England at 6/134. England were bowled out for 215 on the third morning, as Lindwall took 5/70. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended not to notice Lindwall's pain. Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax.\nAustralia batted much more productively in the second innings in ideal weather on the third day. Morris and Barnes put on 122 before the former fell for 62. Bradman joined Barnes at the crease for his last Test innings at the home of cricket. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker then beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was then introduced with the leg trap ploy again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads. The Australian captain decided to negate the danger of being caught glancing at short fine leg by padding the ball away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of Bradman's bat three times in a row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes then manipulated the strike to shield his captain from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap, and negated the danger Bedser was posing. Bradman accelerated after tea and took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty, with Barnes on 96 and Australia at 1/222.\nBarnes passed his century and began accelerating before finally falling for 141, leaving Australia at 2/296 in 277 minutes, after a 174-run partnership with Bradman. Hassett was bowled first ball off the inside edge, but Miller survived a loud lbw appeal on Yardley's hat-trick ball. Bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century in his last Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time because of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but Bedser then moved the ball the other way towards the slips and caught Bradman's outside edge. It was the fourth time out of four innings in the series that Bedser had dismissed Bradman. This left Australia at 4/329 and the next day, Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so that he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. The Australian captain declared on the following day of play at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. England lost wickets regularly and fell for 186 to lose by 409 runs.\nThe next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Test. Australia elected to field and the hosts made 221. Brown injured a finger while fielding, and was not able to bat in Australia's first innings. Ron Hamence filled in as an opener but was out for a duck, so Bradman joined Hassett at 1/6. Bradman made 128 and put on 231 with Hassett (139) as Australia replied with 389. Bradman's innings took only 140 minutes with 15 fours and was described by Jack Fingleton as \"lovely\". In the second innings, Australia's makeshift openers Harvey and Sam Loxton chased down the 122 runs for victory to complete a 10-wicket win. Australia wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch the Australian tennis player John Bromwich compete at Wimbledon and after Bradman had accepted Harvey's offer to open, Australia made the runs in only one hour. Bradman rested himself in the following match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test. Hassett led the team as Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest of the tour, underpinning an innings victory.\nThird Test.\nThe teams reassembled at Old Trafford on 8 July for the Third Test. Australia dropped Brown, who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings; he was replaced by the all rounder Sam Loxton, who had made 47 not out against Surrey and an unbeaten 159 against Gloucestershire. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.\nOn the second day, Bradman was involved in effecting a run out. Denis Compton hit a ball into the covers and Bradman and Loxton collided in an attempt to prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end with Bedser a long way short of the crease. It ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 and featured in a 121-run partnership with Compton. Compton hit several boundaries and Bradman responded by spreading his field to offer Compton a single so that the tail-enders would be on strike and could be attacked. This worked, as Compton was unable to farm the strike as he desired, and wickets fell at the other end. Bradman caught Jack Young to end England's innings at 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes was hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot and taken to hospital, leaving Australia with only Morris as a specialist opening batsman. Ian Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He fell for one to bring Bradman to bat. O'Reilly criticised the use of Johnson to partner Morris, as Hassett had transformed himself into a defensive batsman with little backlift and a guarded approach, a style typical of an opener. The Australian captain thus had to face Bedser, who had already dismissed him three times in the Tests with a new ball, and Pollard, who had troubled him in the match against Lancashire. Pollard then trapped Bradman for seven with an off cutter that struck the Australian captain on the back foot to leave Australia at 2/13. Australia were eventually out for 221, yielding a 142-run lead.\nWhen Bill Edrich came to the crease, Bradman advised Lindwall not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, fearing that it would be interpreted as retaliation for Edrich's bouncing of Lindwall in the first innings and lead to a negative media and crowd reaction. Although Lindwall did not retaliate, Miller did so with four consecutive bouncers, earning the ire of the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop, before apologising to Edrich. England reached 3/174, a lead of 316, at the end of day three, but declared on the fifth morning after the fourth day was washed out. Bradman chose the light roller and play was supposed to begin after lunch. However, play did not begin until after tea and the pitch played very slowly because of the excess moisture. With Australia not looking to chase the runs, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. Australia showed little attacking intent and Bradman joined Morris with Australia at 1/10 after 32 minutes.\nBradman then played 11 balls from Young without scoring. Yardley used the spin of Young and Compton for an hour, while Morris and Bradman made little effort to score. For 105 minutes, Morris stayed at one end and Bradman at the other; neither looked to rotate the strike with singles. Bradman only played eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled that Morris wanted a single that he sent him back. The tourists thereafter batted safely in a defensive manner to ensure a draw. They ended at 1/92 in 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, with 35 maidens, which was the slowest innings run rate to date in the series. Bradman finished unbeaten on 30 from 146 balls when the oft-interrupted match was finally terminated by a series of periodic rain interruptions. O'Reilly criticised the approach taken by the Australians in the closing stages of the match, attributing it to Bradman's orders. He said that the pitch was made so tame by the heavy rain that they could have played in a natural and attractive manner to entertain the spectators, rather than defending carefully. He said that Bradman's \"unwillingness to take a risk or to accept the challenging call of some particular phase of the game is one of the greatest flaws\" in his leadership.\nAfter the Test, Bradman managed only six as Australia scored 317 and 0/22 to defeat Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests. He was again caught in the leg trap by Denis Compton.\nFourth Test.\nThe Fourth Test was played at Headingley, starting on 22 July, and Australia made two changes. Harvey replaced the injured Sid Barnes, while Ron Saggers replaced Don Tallon, who had a finger injury, as wicket-keeper. Brown was not recalled for the Fourth Test to open; instead, Hassett was promoted to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. As Australia were leading 2–0 after three Tests, England needed to win the last two Tests to square the series. England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch.\nAt the start of the innings, Bradman used off theory, but left a large gap square of the wicket in an attempt to coax England's out-of-form top-order to play risky shots into the inviting gap. However, Bradman's offer was spurned as Hutton and Washbrook played cautiously. Meanwhile, Australia's attack appeared unsettled. Bradman set defensive fields for most of the first day as England's openers put on 168 for the first wicket. O'Reilly said that Bradman's defensive field settings \"made the sorry admission of impotency\". England's batsmen dominated to reach stumps at 2/268. Jack Fingleton said that Australia's day went \"progressively downhill\" and was its worst day of bowling since the Second World War, citing the proliferation of full tosses. O'Reilly criticised the display as the worst by the Australians on tour and said that no bowler could be excused. He said that the attack \"functioned without object—hopelessly and meaninglessly\" throughout the day. He lambasted the bowlers for performing at a standard akin to county cricket. O'Reilly criticised the players for having a casual and lethargic manner, speculating that Bradman had been allowed them to become complacent.\nOn the second day, Bradman continued to use defensive tactics for most of the day as England continued to dominate. Australia had trouble removing night-watchman Bedser, who helped take the score to 2/423. Bradman gave his leading bowler Lindwall a heavy workload as the other bowlers appeared unthreatening. O'Reilly decried the use of Lindwall as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity. The hosts were eventually out for 496, their largest score of the series, after a largely self-inflicted collapse late on the second day. Bedser removed Morris for six to leave Australia at 1/13. This brought Bradman to the crease and he was mobbed by the spectators on a ground where he had previously scored two triple centuries and another century in three Tests at the venue. He had made a Test world record of 334 in 1930, scoring 309 in one day's play. Many spectators walked onto the playing arena to greet the arrival of Bradman and he doffed his baggy green and raised his bat to greet them. Fingleton opined that \"on this field he [Bradman] has won his greatest honours; nowhere else has he been so idolatrously acclaimed\". Bradman got off the mark from his first ball, which Compton prevented from going for four with a diving stop near the boundary. Hassett was restrained, while Bradman attacked, taking three fours from one Edrich over. Bradman was 31 and Hassett 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 2/63. Bradman did the majority of the scoring in the late afternoon, scoring 31 in a partnership of 50.\nOn the third morning, Bradman resumed proceedings by taking a single from a Bedser no-ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over bowled by Pollard, Hassett fell for 13 on the second ball, which lifted suddenly after bouncing. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded off the pitch and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett. The crowd, sensing the importance of the two quick wickets, in particular that of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, erupted. This left Australia struggling at 3/68, but a rapid counterattack by the middle and lower order took them to 9/457 at stumps and eventually 458 on the fourth morning.\nEngland batted for the second time, and after lunch on the fourth afternoon, Bradman set fields to restrict the scoring, as England passed 100 without loss. Washbrook then hooked Johnston and top edged it, but Bradman failed to take the catch. He repeated the shot soon after and Harvey took the catch at 1/129, so the Australian captain's miss cost little. Johnson then removed Hutton for 57 without further addition to the total, caught by Bradman on the run, leaving England at 2/129. During most of the afternoon, Bradman used a strategy of rotating his bowlers in short spells, and set a defensive, well-spread field for Johnson, who had been repeatedly attacked by the batsmen. England then reached 8/362 at the close, a lead of 400. England batted on for five minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 8/365. As the batting team is allowed to choose which (if any) roller can be used at the start of the day's play, this ploy allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin. Bradman had done a similar thing during the previous Ashes series in Australia in order to make the batting conditions harder for England. At the start of any innings, the batting captain also has the choice of having the pitch rolled. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his opinion that such a device would disadvantage his batsmen.\nThis left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating spinners' wicket. Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. Only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Both players survived close calls before Hassett fell at 1/57.\nBradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. After receiving another rapturous welcome from the Headingley spectators, Bradman signalled his intentions by hitting a boundary from Compton; and then, on his first ball from Laker, cover driving against the spin for a boundary. He reached 12 in six minutes. Yardley then called upon the occasional leg spin of Hutton in an attempt to exploit the turning wicket. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, and 20 runs in two Hutton overs, which Fingleton described as \"rather terrible\" due to the errant length. Bradman took two fours off Hutton's second over before almost holing out to Yardley. This let Australia reach 1/96 from 90 minutes.\nIn the next over, Compton deceived Bradman with a googly. Bradman expected the ball to turn in, but it went the other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman leg-glanced the next one for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed to hold on. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both players had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.\nAfter the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 minutes from a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This prompted Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.\nBradman was given another life at 108 when he advanced two metres down the pitch to Jim Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 having added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed for 182, having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. He struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling with eight runs still needed. Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. This sealed an Australian victory by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 with 29 fours in only 255 minutes.\nImmediately after the Fourth Test, Bradman scored 62, before being bowled attempting a pull shot to a ball that kept low, as Australia compiled 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings. Bradman rested himself in the next match against Glamorgan, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. He then scored 31 and 13 not out, bowled by Eric Hollies as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Hollies's 8/107 was the best innings bowling figures against the Australians for the summer and earned him selection for the Fifth Test, where he famously dismissed Bradman in his final Test innings for a duck. Australia proceeded to face and draw with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. Bradman made 28 after being dropped twice in Australia's 321, before taking two catches as the tourists took a 191-run lead. He then came in at 1/16 and put on 161 for the second wicket with Barnes, and was unbeaten on 133 when he declared at 3/265. The home side hung on for a draw at 7/199 when time ran out. Bradman then rested himself during the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected draw that was washed out after the first day.\nFifth Test.\nAfter the match against Durham, Australia headed south to The Oval for the Fifth Test, which started on 14 August. Barnes and Tallon returned from injury, while Ernie Toshack was omitted with knee troubles, and the leg spin of Doug Ring replaced Johnson's off spin. Overnight, hundreds of spectators had slept on wet pavements in rainy weather to queue for tickets. Bradman had already announced that he would retire at the end of the season, and the public were anxious to witness his last Test appearance.\nEnglish skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Yardley's decision was regarded as a surprise; although The Oval had traditionally been a batting paradise, weather conditions suggested that bowlers would have the advantage. Jack Fingleton speculated that Australia would have bowled first if Bradman had won the toss. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, England were dismissed for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon.\nIn contrast, Australia batted much more fluently as the overcast skies cleared and the sun came out. Australia had reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The score had reached 117 before Barnes was removed by Hollies for 61. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, late on the first day. As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket. Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies from the back foot. Hollies pitched the next ball up, bowling Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the batsman leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around and walked back to the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause. Australia went on to make 389 and then bowled England out for 188 to win by an innings and 149 runs.\nThis result sealed the series 4–0 in favour of Australia. The match was followed by a series of congratulatory speeches.\nBradman said\nYardley said\nBradman was then given three cheers and the crowd sung \"For he's a jolly good fellow\" before dispersing.\nLater tour matches.\nSeven matches remained on Bradman's quest to complete an English season without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Bradman made 65, putting on 104 with Brown as Australia made 361 and won by an innings. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, Bradman came to the crease at 1/40 and featured in a 180-run second wicket partnership with Brown, before adding another 110 with Hassett. He was out for 150 at 3/331 before declaring at 5/610 against a team that included eight Test players. Australia went on to win by an innings. He then rested himself as Australia defeated Somerset by an innings and 374 runs. Bradman returned to make 143 against the South of England, adding 188 for the third wicket with Hassett. Australia declared at 7/522 and bowled out the hosts for 298 before rain ended the match.\nAustralia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI starting on 8 September, its last first-class match for the tour. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit and had defeated Australia, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team; the only difference from the Fifth Test team was Johnson's inclusion at the expense of Ring. His bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Morris and Barnes put on an opening stand of 102 before Morris was out for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and they put on 225 runs for the second wicket. Bradman top-scored with 153 as Australia declared at 8/469 late on the final day. Upon reaching 153, he threw away his wicket with a lofted cover drive, having decided to attempt sixes to give Alec Bedser his wicket. He was already running towards the pavilion before the catch was taken, ending his last first-class innings in England. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. When it became obvious that Australia would not lose, Bradman bowled his only over of the tour, conceding two runs.\nThe tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, Bradman made 27 of Australia's 236 as the tourists took an innings victory. In the second match, Bradman top-scored with 123 not out batting at No. 6, hitting 17 fours and two sixes in 89 minutes as Australia declared at 6/407. Australia ended the tour with another innings victory. Once Australia were in an unassailable position during Scotland's second innings, Bradman relaxed and allowed nine players to bowl, including the wicket-keeper Tallon, who took two wickets, while Johnson stood in as the wicket-keeper. When the victory was sealed on 18 September, Bradman's men became the first side to go through an English season without defeat.\nRole.\nAlong with Chappie Dwyer and Jack Ryder, Bradman was one of the three selectors who chose the squad to tour England. This gave Bradman more power than other Australian captains, who did not have an explicit vote in team selection. This was further magnified by Bradman being a member of the Board of Control while an active player, a threefold combination that he alone has occupied in Australian cricket history. According to Gideon Haigh, he \"was the dominant figure in Australian cricket\", who went on to become an \"unimpeachable figure\".\nTurning 40 in August during the tour, Bradman was by far the most senior and oldest player on the team. Bill Brown was the next oldest, making his third tour of England at 36. His vice-captain Lindsay Hassett was the third-oldest player, at the age of 35. Ernie Toshack was born in December 1914, and the remaining 13 players were born in 1916 or later. Five players, including Ray Lindwall, Bill Johnston and Morris, his two most prolific Test bowlers and batsman respectively, were more than 12 years younger than he was. Neil Harvey, the youngest player at the age of 19, was only two months old when Bradman made his Test debut. Bradman was viewed as a father figure by players such as Harvey and Sam Loxton. Before the tour, Bradman had played 47 Tests; Brown, the only other member who had played regularly before the Second World War, had appeared in 20 Tests. For Bradman, it was the most personally fulfilling period of his playing days, as the divisiveness within the team of the 1930s had passed. He wrote:\nHowever, some players expressed displeasure at Bradman's ruthless obsession towards annihilating the opposition. The all rounder Keith Miller, who was one of two bowling spearheads, deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball for duck during the match against Essex, while Bradman was his batting partner, in a protest against Australia's world record of scoring 721 runs in one day. Miller also deplored Bradman's hard-nosed attitude in the match against Leveson-Gower's XI, which was traditionally regarded as a \"festival match\". Feeling that Bradman was needlessly batting Australia far beyond impregnability, Miller played with reckless aggression, rather than a measured style in line with Bradman's aim of remaining undefeated. Bradman's later letter revealed his hostility towards Miller. Sid Barnes later criticised Bradman for his reluctance to allow Ron Hamence—one of the reserve batsmen—to partake in meaningful matchplay; due to Bradman's reluctance to risk Australia's unbeaten run, Hamence usually batted low in the order and had limited opportunities because the senior batsmen were rarely dismissed cheaply. Along with fringe bowlers Doug Ring and Colin McCool, Hamence called himself \"Ground Staff\" due to the trio's lack of on-field duties, and they often sang ironic songs about their status.\nBradman's relentless use of his pace attack and fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace and the ability to deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl at the body. England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed as close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was in the spirit of the game.\nBradman's dominant cricketing stature was also a key platform of his team's popularity with the public. The leading English writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said \"we want him to do well. We feel we have a share in him. He is more than Australian. He is a world batsman.\" Haigh opined that \"perhaps no touring cricketer ... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer\". The Australians were invariably greeted by record crowds and gate receipts across the country. The attendance at the Fourth Test remains a record for a Test on English soil. The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that \"cities, towns and hotels are beflagged, carpets set down, and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome. He is the Prince of Cricketers.\" Haigh said that \"cricket approached the 50s at the peak of its popularity, albeit, after Bradman's final Test ... without the player chiefly responsible for it\". Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day, and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live, causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin. Of Bradman's retirement, Robertson-Glasgow said \"... a miracle has been removed from among us... So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal.\"\nBradman ended the first-class matches atop the batting aggregates and averages, with 2428 runs at 89.92, and eleven centuries, the most by any player. The next most prolific scorer was Morris with 1922 runs, and Hassett had the next best average with 74.42. His highest score of the tour was 187 against Essex, and he reached 150 on four occasions. Despite his success, he also gained attention for his troubles against Alec Bedser's leg trap; Bradman was dismissed three consecutive times in the Tests in this manner, and twice outside the Tests to other bowlers using the same ploy. Robertson-Glasgow said \"at last his batting showed human fallibility. Often, especially at the start of the innings, he played where the ball wasn't, and spectators rubbed their eyes\". In the Tests, Bradman finished with 508 runs at 72.57 and two centuries. Only Morris and Barnes averaged higher and only Morris and Denis Compton of England aggregated more. Apart from the match against Leicestershire, when he batted at No. 4, and the two non-first-class matches against Scotland, Bradman always batted at No. 3.N- He bowled only one over during the tour, against the Leveson-Gower's XI when the result of the match was beyond doubt.\nNotes.\nStatistical note.\nn-[1]\nThis statement can be verified by consulting all of the scorecards for the matches, as listed here."

        "title": "Lindsay Hassett with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Lindsay Hassett was the vice-captain and one of three on-tour selectors for Don Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948. The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\", and resulted in them being regarded as one of the greatest teams of all time. A right-handed batsman, Hassett played in all five Tests; he was a middle-order batsman in all but the Fourth Test, when he stood in as an opener due to an injury to Sid Barnes.\nAs the matches were often played consecutively without a day between fixtures, Australia employed a rotation policy, and as a result, Hassett captained the team in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures in which more than half the playing time was lost. Hassett had two close encounters, both on damp pitches before the First Test. Against Yorkshire, Australia scraped home by four wickets in a low-scoring match with ten men after Sam Loxton succumbed to injury. In a later match against Hampshire, Australia ceded a first innings lead for the first time on tour, but recovered to win by eight wickets.\nHassett ended the first-class matches with 1,563 runs at a batting average of 74.22 including seven centuries. Among the Australians, he had the third highest aggregate behind Bradman and Arthur Morris and the second highest average. His highest score was an unbeaten 200 against the Gentlemen of England. Hassett was less successful in the Tests, scoring 310 runs at 44.28 with one century. This placed him fourth in the Australian aggregates, but only seventh in the averages. His biggest contribution was his 137 in the first innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge. It was a patient innings as England attempted to stop Australia's scoring with defensive leg theory; Hassett helped the tourists set up a first innings lead of 344, which laid the foundation for the eventual victory. He had three scores between 35 and 50 during the Tests, but was unable to convert his starts into large innings. Hassett took 23 catches on the tour, the most by an Australia excluding wicket-keepers.\nHassett was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1949. \"Wisden\" remarked that \"in addition to his playing ability Hassett's cheerfulness and leadership, which extended to off-the-field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme, combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman's busy shoulders\".\nBackground.\nThe 1948 tour was Hassett's second Test campaign in England. A diminutive right-handed batsman, he toured England under Bradman in 1938, making his Test debut during the series and playing in all four matches. Following the interruption of World War II, Hassett led the Australian Services—a military team—in the Victory Tests. He became a regular member of the Test team and was the vice-captain under Bradman for the series against England and India in Australia during 1946–47 and 1947–48 respectively. In the latter Test series, he averaged 110.66 with the bat, and he was duly selected for the tour of England, continuing in his role as Bradman's deputy.\nEarly tour.\nAustralia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Hassett thus played as vice-captain of Bradman's first-choice team and took a catch as Australia dismissed the hosts for 233. However, when Australia batted, Bradman rearranged the order and Hassett came in at No.7 with Australia's score at 5/320 after losing 4/55 in a middle-order collapse. Hassett made 25 in 66 minutes with three fours as Australia declared at 8/462; the hosts were bowled out for 212 to complete an Australian victory by an innings and 17 runs. Hassett was rested for next match against Leicestershire, which resulted in another innings win for the tourists.\nThe Australians then proceeded to play Yorkshire at Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling; rain delayed the start of the match until midway through the first afternoon. Bradman rested himself and returned to London while Hassett led the team. Yorkshire elected to bat and were bowled out in difficult batting conditions for 71, despite Australia losing all rounder Sam Loxton with a hamstring injury. Australia replied with 101 without Loxton, who was unable to bat. Hassett came in at 1/24 and was immediately out for a duck. Australia then bowled out the hosts in the second innings for 89. Chasing 60 for victory, Hassett elected to not ask for the pitch to be rolled. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said Hassett \"might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [erratic bounce and sideways movement] out of the pitch\". Australia lost quick wickets and Hassett came in with the score at 2/5. Keith Miller was then out at 3/13 after attempting to hit a six, while Hassett was nervous after his first innings duck. Ron Hamence joined Hassett and they took the score to 20 before the former was run out attempting a quick single. Without further addition to the score, Hassett attempted a pull shot and top edged it so high that five players had the time to converge and any of these could have caught the ball. The catch was eventually taken directly in front of Hassett, leaving Australia at 5/20. To make matters worse, Loxton was still too injured to bat, so Australia effectively had only four wickets in hand and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. Neil Harvey had scored a solitary run when he was dropped at short leg. Colin McCool fell at 6/31, and Harvey and new partner Don Tallon were both given lives before the tourists scraped home by four wickets. It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour, and Hassett was very relieved, playing his head in his hands and muttering \"Why me? Why is it always me?\" in a reference to his encountering rain-affected wickets as captain.\nBradman returned to lead the Australians in the next match against Surrey at The Oval in London; Australia won the toss and batted first. Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris put on 136, before Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 before the opener fell for 176. Hassett came in and Bradman was dismissed for 146 at 3/403. Hassett struck form and reached his first century for the English summer, posting 110 before being clean bowled by Test seamer Alec Bedser as Australia were bowled out for 632. Bedser pitched an outswinger on leg stump and it moved away to clip Hassett's off stump. Bradman's men then bowled Surrey out for 141 and 195 to win by an innings.\nBradman rested himself for the next match against Cambridge University, and Hassett led the tourists to another innings victory after the hosts won the toss and elected to bat. After Cambridge had made 167, Hassett scored an unbeaten 61 in a partnership of 140 with Bill Brown before declaring at 4/414 when Brown fell for 200. Hassett's bowlers then dismissed the hosts for 196 in the second innings, sealing victory by an innings and 51 runs. In the following match against Essex, Bradman returned and Hassett was rested as Australia won the toss and batted first, scoring a world-record of 721 first-class runs in one day. The visitors then proceeded to victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the summer. Bradman then rested himself for the next game against Oxford University, where Hassett oversaw another innings victory. Hassett made a duck, caught from a rearing ball from paceman Philip Whitcombe, as Australia made 431 and then enforced the follow on.\nThe next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full-strength Test team, while Australia selected their first-choice team. Bradman captained the team and batted at No.3 with Hassett in his customary position at No.4. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team would line up for Australia in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. It was a chance for players from both sides to gain a psychological advantage before the Tests. Australia elected to bat and Hassett came in to join Bradman at 2/171. The pair took the score to 200 before Bradman fell for 98 to leave Australia at 3/200. Hassett then put on 80 with Miller before being trapped leg before wicket (lbw) for 51 by Jack Young. Fingleton hailed Hassett's display as \"the prettiest half century we saw in the whole summer. There was not effort in his play. The ball sped quietly and quickly in all directions.\" Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings, with Hassett catching Len Hutton and Ken Cranston in the first innings.\nThe MCC match was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. Hassett was rested as the first day was washed out and the match ended in a draw. In the following match against Nottinghamshire, the hosts batted first and made 179. Hassett made 44 and featured in a partnership of 81 with Keith Miller as the tourists reached 400. However, Nottinghamshire ended at 8/299 to hang on for a draw in the second innings. Bradman rested himself for the following match against Hampshire, and Hassett oversaw another scare. On a drying pitch, Australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to the home side's 195, the first time they had conceded a first innings lead on tour. Australia had made a solid start, reaching 2/70 before Hassett fell for 26, sparking a collapse of 8/47 to be all out for 117. This prompted Bradman to telegram Hassett: \"Bradford was bad enough but this is unbearable, heads up and chins down.\" Hampshire were then bowled out for 103, leaving Australia a target of 182, which they reached to seal an eight-wicket win, with Hassett unbeaten on 27. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex. Hassett was rested as Australia skittled the hosts for 86 and declared at 5/549, before completing another innings victory.\nFirst Test.\nAustralia headed into the First Test at Trent Bridge with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, including eight innings victories. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting after offering some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour. The surface had greened up following overnight rain. Australia's fast bowlers reduced England to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first day. The tourists had already taken the lead by the time Hassett came in to join Bradman at 4/185 on the second afternoon. The hard-hitting Miller had come in at No.4, the more Hassett's usual position, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed as Miller was out for a duck.\nAustralia had been scoring slowly, as they would throughout the day, and following Hassett's entrance, the Australians slowed further as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once. Hassett almost holed out early when he knocked a ball from Alec Bedser up in the air and it just evaded the grasp of wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. Yardley continued to employ leg theory, as he and Charlie Barnett bowled outside leg stump; this tactic stifled the Australian scoring but also limited wicket-taking opportunities. During one over, Bradman did not attempt to hit a single ball and put his hands on his hips to express his displeasure at England's tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian skipper did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. In the last session, Bradman brought up one of his slowest ever centuries, as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking Australian wickets. Bradman reached stumps on 130. Hassett also batted patiently, with one period of 20 minutes during which his score remained on 30. Australia closed the second day at 4/293 to lead by 128, with Hassett on 41, having combined for an unbroken stand of 108 with Bradman.\nEarly on the third day, Bradman fell for 138 with the score at 5/305. Yardley again pinned Hassett down with more leg theory. Laker bowled with one slip, while Young had none and employed a pure ring field. The scoring was slow during this passage of play—Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs. In the face of the slow proceedings, Hassett conducted himself in a humorous way, and English commentator John Arlott said that \"only his grace and concealed humour made his innings tolerable\". He mainly scored from deflections and was for the most part prepared to take his time. The injured Ray Lindwall came out to join Hassett at 7/365 without a runner. Hassett—who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the morning—swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first six of the match. Hassett added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. Australia were unhurried and remained patient in the face of Yardley's defensive tactics because they had bowled England out on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result. After the break, Hassett reached his first Test century on English soil. from 305 minutes. He then accelerated, adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes, before being bowled by Bedser, having struck 20 fours and a six. This ended an eighth-wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall with the score at 8/473; Australia ended at 509 to take a 344-run first innings lead.\nDuring England's second innings, Joe Hardstaff, Jr. fell for 43, lofting Ernie Toshack to Hassett on the leg side to end a partnership of 93 with Denis Compton. The ball looped up in the air and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Australia eventually finished off the hosts for 441, leaving them a target of 98 on the final afternoon. Australia proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell. Bradman came in and was out for a duck. This left Australia at 2/48, at which point dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and it appeared that rain might save England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. The tourists reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary, but ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing that the match was over. He returned to the field when he noticed the crowd reaction; Hassett hit the winning run to end with an unbeaten 21.\nBetween Tests, Bradman rested himself for the match against Northamptonshire, which started the day after the Test. Hassett won the toss and elected to bowl; his bowlers ensured that the decision paid off by bowling out the hosts for 119. When Australia batted, Hassett came in at 1/17 and added 122 runs for the second wicket with Morris before combining for another 104 with Ron Hamence. Hassett was eventually out for the top score of 127, having played with flair and freedom he eschewed in the Tests, before Australia declared at 8/352. The bowlers then removed Northamptonshire for 169, giving Australia a victory by an innings and 64 runs. Hassett also took five catches for the match. He was rested for the second match against Yorkshire, which was drawn.\nSecond Test.\nAustralia opted to field an unchanged lineup for the Second Test at Lord's. Bradman elected to bat, allowing Lindwall more time to recover from a groin strain before being required to bowl. Hassett came in to join Morris at 2/87 when Bradman fell soon after lunch on the first day. The new ball was available, but England had declined to take it. Bedser beat Hassett second ball with a delivery that moved back in, but the appeal for lbw was turned down. However, Yardley opted to not take the ball, and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain finally called for a replacement ball. Journalist and retired Australian cricketer Bill O'Reilly said that the failure to take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a failure to maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett.\nThe pair added 79 before Morris fell for 105 and Miller was out seven runs later at 4/173. By taking two quick wickets, England had put the match back in the balance. Batting out of position in the middle order, Brown came in and helped Hassett to rebuild the innings. Both scored slowly, averaging more than three and half minutes for each run. Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley, who was bowling mainly in order to allow his frontline bowlers to recuperate, broke through his defences with a yorker, dismissing him for 47 after 175 minutes of batting; the English skipper trapped Brown lbw nine runs later to leave Australia 6/225. Australia recovered to 350 on the second morning, and England were then bowled out on the third morning for 215. Australia's top-order scored quickly and Hassett came in with the score at 2/296 after 277 minutes of batting. Yardley bowled Hassett first ball off the inside edge, so Miller came to the crease at 3/296 to face the hat-trick ball. Miller survived a loud lbw appeal to deny the English captain a hat-trick. Australia then declared at 7/460 on the fourth day to leave England a target of 596, which would have taken a world record run-chase for victory. Hassett caught Alec Bedser from the bowling of Bill Johnston as Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 early on the final morning to win by 409 runs.\nThe next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Lord's Test. Australia elected to field and dismissed the hosts for 221. Brown injured a finger while fielding and was unable to bat in Australia's first innings. Hamence filled in as an opener alongside Hassett but was out for a duck, so Bradman joined his deputy with the score at 1/6. The Australian skipper put on 231 with Hassett, who top-scored with 139. Accelerating after reaching his century, Hassett was out for 4/289 and the tourists collapsed to be all out for 389, after losing 7/100. In the second innings, Australia's makeshift openers Harvey and Sam Loxton chased down the 122 runs required for a 10-wicket win in less than hour, so Hassett was not required to bat.\nBradman rested himself for the following match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test. Hassett led the team and elected to bat as Australia reached 7/774 declared on the second day. It was the tourists' highest score for the tour and the second best by any Australian team on English soil. Hassett instructed his batsmen to attack local off spinner Tom Goddard, who was seen as a possible selection for England in the Third Test. His batsmen used their feet to charge at Goddard, who was used to batsmen playing him from static positions, and could not cope. Goddard took 0/186 from 32 overs and his chances of being selected ended. However, Hassett was unable to join the plunder, making only 21. He then enforced the follow on as the hosts were out for 279 and 132 to cede victory by an innings and 363 runs. Hassett allowed himself to bowl for the first time on tour, sending down two overs for eight runs without taking a wicket.\nThird Test.\nThe teams reassembled at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia replaced Brown—who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings— with the all rounder Loxton, who had made an unbeaten 47 against Surrey and 159 not out against Gloucestershire. England made 363 after electing to bat. On the second day, Australia were in trouble when Hassett came in at 2/13. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter was beaten in flight by Jack Young. Aiming to break Young's restrictive leg side bowling, Hassett charged down the pitch and lofted a drive for four. However, in attempting a similar lofted drive over cover, he mishit the ball, which was caught by Cyril Washbrook at wide mid-off. This left Australia at 3/82 and they eventually made 221 to avoid the follow on by eight runs.\nIn England's second innings, Lindwall bounced Washbrook and the England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew in the air straight towards fine leg, where Hassett dropped the ball on the third attempt. At the time, Washbrook was on 21. The English batsman had moved to 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg and was again dropped by Hassett. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman before humorously gesturing to indicate that he was ready for the next catch, much to the amusement of the crowd. On 80, Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack. After the day's play, Washbrook shouted Hassett a drink; England were in a strong position at 3/174, with an overall lead of 316. Luckily for Australia, the pair of missed chances from the England opener late in the day cost little. Washbrook remained unbeaten on 85 as England declared without further addition to their score midway through the last day; the entire fourth day and the final morning had been lost to rain. Hassett was not required as Australia batted for 61 overs to reach 1/92 and ensure that the match ended in a draw.\nAfter Old Trafford, Hassett was rested as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.\nFourth Test.\nThe teams then headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test. Australia made two changes. Neil Harvey replaced the injured Barnes, while Ron Saggers replaced Don Tallon—who had a finger injury—behind the stumps. The reserve opener Brown was not recalled to open in the absence of Barnes; instead, Hassett would improvise and open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. As Australia led 2–0 after three Tests, England needed to win the last two matches to square the series. The home team won the toss and elected to bat on a batsman-friendly pitch. Hassett dropped Len Hutton—who went on to score 81—on 25. England's first-wicket partnership was broken at 168 and was their first opening stand beyond 42 for the series. The hosts were eventually out for 496 on the second day. Hassett caught England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans, who meekly prodded a ball from Sam Loxton straight to silly mid-on.\nWith Barnes injured, Hassett moved from the middle-order to open the innings with Morris. Bedser removed Morris for six to leave Australia at 1/13, bringing Bradman to the crease.\nHassett batted in a restrained manner, while Bradman attacked. The Australian captain was 31 and his deputy 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 1/63. Bradman did the majority of the scoring during the closing stages of the afternoon, adding 31 in a partnership of 50. On the third morning, play resumed in hot and humid conditions. In the second over delivered by Dick Pollard, the bowler made the second ball lift unexpectedly. Hassett was unable to get out of the way and edged the ball to Jack Crapp for 13. Bradman was out in the same over and Australia were in trouble at 3/68, but they recovered after a middle-order counterattack took them to 458 early on the fourth day. Hassett then caught Bedser during England's second innings.\nEngland declared at 8/365 after two overs on the last day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make it more likely to spin. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.\nYardley's declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting team. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target; the local press wrote them off and predicted that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket that was expected to favour the spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a surface that offered spin and bounce. It appeared that they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point. Only 44 runs came in the first hour, meaning that 360 runs were still needed in 285 minutes. Evans then missed a leg-side stumping opportunity against Hassett as Bedser beat both openers with extra bounce. Hassett was dismissed by Compton's left-arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57. The Englishman's delivery had caught Hassett's leading edge and he dived forward in his follow through to take a one-handed catch just above the ground. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. The English spinners created a number of chances against both batsmen, but multiple catches and stumping opportunities were fumbled. Aside from the missed wicket-taking opportunities, the spinners were erratic in line and length and Bradman and Morris plundered many boundaries. Australia went on to complete the world record chase with seven wickets and 15 minutes in hand, ensuring an unassailable 3–0 series lead.\nHassett was rested as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings immediately after the Fourth Test. He then led the team in place of the resting Bradman in the next match against Glamorgan, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. The hosts fell for 197 and Hassett was unbeaten on 71 as Australia reached 3/215—having featured in a partnership of 126 with Miller—when the weather ended the match.\nIn response to the home side's 138, Hassett top-scored with 68 in Australia's first innings of 254 before being trapped leg before wicket by Eric Hollies as the tourists defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Hollies's 8/107 was the best innings bowling figures against the Australians for the summer. The feat earned him selection for the Fifth Test, where he dismissed Bradman in his final Test innings for a duck.\nHassett was then rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. Bradman then rested himself and Hassett captained in the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Hassett made three while batting at No.8 as Australia made 282 and then had the hosts at 5/73 when rain washed out the match after the first day.\nFifth Test.\nAustralia then headed to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes returned from injury, so Hassett returned to his customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley's men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed to get the ball in the middle of the bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton made only four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.\nIn contrast, Australia batted with apparent ease, as the overcast skies cleared and sun came out late on the first afternoon. The opening partnership had reached 117 before Hollies removed Barnes for 61. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00. As Bradman had announced that the tour would be his last at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. With 6,996 Test career runs, he needed only four runs to average 100.00 in Test cricket. On the second ball, Hollies bowled Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the Australian skipper leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned and slowly turned around and walked back to the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause.\nHassett came in with the score at 2/117 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77 and Hassett 10. The next day, the pair took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply on the first day and were already well in the lead, they had plenty of time to complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to string together substantial partnerships and Australia ended at 389. When England batted again, Allan Watkins pulled Doug Ring to the leg side and straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 6/167. The home team were eventually out for 188 and Australia thus sealed the series 4–0 with an innings victory.\nLater tour matches.\nSeven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Hassett was rested as Australia defeated Kent by an innings. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England at Lord's, Hassett came to the crease at 2/221 after Brown was out for 121 and featured in a 110-run third-wicket partnership with Bradman, who then fell for 150. Miller came in and put on 157 with Hassett before being dismissed for 69 on the second day. Australia eventually declared at 5/610 when Hassett reached 200 not out against a team that featured eight Test players. Australia went on to win by an innings after enforcing the follow on. Bradman then rested himself and Hassett led Australia against Somerset. Hassett decided to bat and came to the crease when Brown was run out before Australia had scored a single run. On his 35th birthday, he made 103 and was the next batsman to fall at 2/256, after a second-wicket partnership with Barnes, who retired ill on 42, and Harvey, who went on to make 126. This ended a partnership of 187 in only 110 minutes with Harvey. Australia declared on 5/560 at the end of the first day. Hassett enforced the follow on as Australia went on to win by an innings and 374 runs, skittling the hosts for 115 and 71. Hassett made it three centuries in a row against the South of England. He came in at 2/49 to join Bradman and the pair added 188 for the third wicket before the captain fell for 143 with the total at 3/237. Hassett then put on 175 with Harvey before the latter was out for 110 at 4/412. This ended a partnership of 175 in only 110 minutes. He was eventually out for the top score of 151 while attempting a big hit, leaving the score at 6/446, having anchored the tourists' innings. Australia declared at 7/522 and bowled out the hosts for 298 when rain ended the match. Hassett bowled six wicketless overs and conceded 28 runs in South's only innings.\nAustralia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but on this occasion Bradman insisted that only six current English Test players be allowed to participate. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being the inclusion of Ian Johnson at the expense of Doug Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Hassett came in at No.10 and made an unbeaten seven as Australia declared at 8/469. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. It was the tourists' last first-class match for the tour and when it became obvious that they would not lose, Bradman let Hassett bowl four overs for twelve runs without taking a wicket. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Hassett missed both matches; Australia won both by an innings.\nRole.\nAside from being the vice-captain, Hassett was one of three on-tour selectors along with Bradman and Morris. As matches often started the day after the previous fixture, Australia employed a rotation policy and Hassett led the tourists in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures in which more than half the playing time was lost. Hassett had two close encounters as captain, both on damp pitches before the First Test. Against Yorkshire, Australia scraped home by four wickets with ten men after Sam Loxton was injured in a low-scoring match. In a later game against Hampshire, Australia ceded a first innings lead for the first time on tour after a middle-order collapse, but recovered to win by eight wickets. The matches against Cambridge University, Oxford University, Northamptonshire, Gloucestershire and Somerset were won by an innings. The wins over the latter two were particularly convincing; Australia amassed its largest score for the tour against Gloucestershire, making 7/774 declared before winning by an innings and 363 runs. After the Tests, Australia compiled 5/560 against Somerset and won by an innings and 374 runs in less than two days. The matches against Durham and Glamorgan were washed out, with at least half the playing time lost.\nA right-handed batsman, Hassett played in all five Tests; he batted in the middle-order in all but the Fourth Test at Headingley, when he opened due to an injury to Sid Barnes. Aside from the Headingley Test, Hassett batted at No.4 after Morris, Barnes and Bradman and in front of Keith Miller, except in the first innings of the series when he batted at No.6 and made 137. Hassett scored 310 runs at 44.28, placing him fourth in the Australian aggregates, but only seventh in the averages. He took six catches and did not bowl during the Tests.\nHassett ended the first-class tour with 1,563 runs at 74.22 with seven first-class centuries. He had the third highest aggregate behind Bradman and Morris and the second highest average. His highest score was an unbeaten 200 against the Gentlemen of England. In his 27 first-class innings, Hassett batted at Nos.3, 4,and5 21 times. Aside from the three instances in which he batted outside these positions in the Tests, Hassett made 139 while opening in the second match against Surrey in place of the injured Bill Brown, and 35 and seven not out against Worcestershire and Leveson-Gower's XI, batting at No.7 and No.10 respectively. N- An occasional medium pacer, Hassett delivered 12 overs—none in Tests—without taking a wicket. He took 23 catches, the most by an Australian (excluding wicket-keepers).\nIn recognition of his performances, Hassett was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949. \"Wisden\" opined that \"in addition to his playing ability Hassett's cheerfulness and leadership, which extended to off-the-field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme, combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman's busy shoulders\".\nNotes.\nStatistical note.\nn-[1]\nThis statement can be verified by consulting all the scorecards for the matches, as listed here."

        "title": "Bill Brown with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Bill Brown was a member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948. Bradman's men went through their 34 matches without defeat; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\".\nAn experienced right-handed opening batsman, Brown was on his third visit to England, having first toured in 1934 before World War II. However, Brown's best years were lost to the war and by 1948 Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris had superseded him in the pecking order to become Australia's first-choice opening pair. Brown was selected as a reserve opener; this decision generated controversy among critics who believed he was past his best.\nBradman rotated the three openers in the tour matches, but Morris and Barnes were preferred in the Tests. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the middle order in the Tests. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and was dropped after making 73 runs at a batting average of 24.33 in the first two Tests.\nDespite his struggles in the Test arena, Brown had success in the tour matches as an opener. He scored 1,448 runs at 57.92 in all first-class matches, ranking fourth in both the aggregates and averages. He scored eight centuries, second only to Bradman, including 200 against Cambridge University. However, Brown gained criticism for his slow batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown batted in a highly circumspect manner to increase the reliability and volume of his scoring. A very occasional off spin bowler, Brown took his career first-class best of 4/16 in his only stint with the ball, against the South of England.\nBackground.\nBrown had been a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and immediately after World War II, he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against New Zealand. However, he was sidelined by injury in 1946–47 and Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively. Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. Barnes then came in and made 139 runs in the next two Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test. Morris was then rested for the Fifth Test to allow Brown another chance to show his ability and make a case for continued national selection, and he made 99. In the Tests against India during the season, Barnes, Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. In any case, Brown had done enough to tour England with \"The Invincibles\" in 1948, his third trip there, although Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination.\nEarly tour.\nAustralia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Brown gained selection, although Bradman batted him out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened. Brown came in 6/335 and scored 25 at a typically placid pace, accumulating his runs at a lower strike rate than the other recognised batsmen. He was out with the score at 6/402 as Australia went on to declare at 8/462 and win by an innings.\nIn the next match against Leicestershire, Bradman rested Morris, so Brown opened with Barnes. Brown scored 26 in an opening stand of 46, as Australia amassed 448 and won by an innings.\nThe Australians proceeded to play Yorkshire at Bradford, on a damp pitch suitable for slower bowling. In the first innings, Brown took three catches from the bowling of Keith Miller—who had resorted to bowling off spin—as Yorkshire were bowled out for 71 in difficult batting conditions. Opening with Morris while Barnes was rested, Brown made 13 as the match remained finely balanced after Australia was bowled out for 101. Brown took another catch from Miller in the second innings as the hosts were bowled out for 89. Chasing 60 for victory, Brown fell to Frank Smailes for two as the Australian top order collapsed to 6/31—effectively seven wickets down with the injured Sam Loxton unable to bat—before scraping home by four wickets.\nBrown was rested for the next match against Surrey, which Australia won by an innings. After the first four matches, five Australians had made centuries, and another had passed fifty. Brown had scored only 66 runs with a highest score of 26, while Morris and Barnes, the incumbent openers, had scored 223 and 298 runs with a century and fifty apiece.\nBrown was recalled for the match against Cambridge University, opening with Morris while Barnes rested. After putting on 64 for the opening wicket with Morris, Brown added 176 for the second wicket with Ron Hamence. He added a further 140 for the fourth wicket with Lindsay Hassett, who was captaining the team while Bradman rested himself. Brown top-scored with 200 and Hassett declared when his double-centurion was out with the score at 4/414. Australia went on to win by an innings. In the following match against Essex, Brown opened with Barnes while Morris was rested. The pair put on 145 in 97 minutes—the highest opening stand by the Australians on the tour to that point—before Barnes was out hit wicket. In the meantime, Brown had reached 50 in 90 minutes. Bradman came in and he and Brown accelerated to put on a second-wicket partnership of 219 in 90 minutes, before the latter was out for 153 from three hours of batting with the score at 2/364. Brown had scored his last 100 runs in less than 90 minutes. Australia went on to score 721 runs on the first day, the highest number of runs amassed in one day of first-class cricket, before completing victory by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the tour. Opening with Morris while Barnes was rested, Brown completed his third century in as many innings with 108 against Oxford University, after putting on an opening stand of 139. This meant that he had scored 461 runs in eight days of cricket, and put him atop the batting aggregates, ahead of Bradman. Australia went on to complete their fourth successive innings victory.\nThe next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Bradman installed Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown batted out of position at No. 6. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same positions. It was a chance for players from both sides to gain a psychological advantage, but Brown failed to capitalise. He came to the crease with the score at 4/280 to join Keith Miller and scored 26 in a stand of 63 before being dismissed as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings. This was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, against Lancashire, a draw for which Brown was rested.\nBrown returned for the following match, which was against Nottinghamshire, and added 122 to register his fourth century in less than three weeks. Australia made 400 but the hosts hung on for a draw in the second innings. In the next match against Hampshire, Brown opened with Barnes and made a duck as Australia were dismissed for 117 on a damp pitch in reply to the home side's 195. It was the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings during the summer. Hampshire were subsequently bowled out in their second innings for 103 to leave Australia a target of 182. This time Barnes fell for a duck, and Brown anchored Australia to an eight-wicket win with an unbeaten 81 after a century second-wicket partnership with Ian Johnson. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex. Opening with Morris, Brown played second fiddle, accumulating 44 as the pair put on an opening stand of 153. Morris went on to 184 and Australia declared at 5/549 before completing another innings victory.\nFirst Test.\nUp to this point, Brown—who was on his third tour of England—had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72.72, with a double century, three other centuries and 81 not out, In contrast, middle-order batsman Neil Harvey struggled in the initial stages of his first tour of England. Harvey failed to pass 25 in his first six innings, and although he had scored an unbeaten 100 against Sussex, he had totalled only 296 runs at 42.29. As a result, Brown gained selection in the First Test at Trent Bridge, batting out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.\nEngland batted first and made 165, with Brown prominent in the field. Early on the first day of play, Brown caught England opener Cyril Washbrook on the run at the fine leg boundary after the batsman had attempted to hook a Ray Lindwall bouncer, leaving England at 2/15 after 41 minutes of play. He later made a series of one-handed stops in the field, helping to keep the pressure on the batsmen. Brown took his second catch of the innings to remove Alec Bedser, who had featured in a rearguard fightback to help take England to 165 after they had fallen to 8/74.\nOn the second day, Barnes and Bradman took the score to 1/121 before Barnes and Miller were dismissed without further addition to the score. All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would throughout the day. Brown came in at No. 5 to join Bradman, but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and he looked uncomfortable in the middle order, but Bradman brought him in ahead of Hassett as the new ball was due and Brown was used to starting his innings against pace bowlers and a new ball. English captain Norman Yardley removed Jim Laker from the attack and took the second new ball. Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes and the run rate picked up somewhat, prompting England to revert to slower bowling. Australia passed England's total before Yardley brought himself on to bowl and trapped Brown—who was attempting to push the ball to mid-on—leg before wicket (lbw) with an off cutter in his first over. This ended a 64-run stand in 58 minutes and left Australia at 4/185. Following the departure of Brown, the scoring slowed as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once. Australia eventually reached 509, and after England compiled 441 in their second innings, Brown was not needed as Australia made the 98 runs required victory for the loss of only two wickets.\nBetween Tests, Brown was rested for the match against Northamptonshire, which Australia won by an innings. He returned for the second fixture against Yorkshire. Opening with Barnes, Brown made 19 as Australia took a 43-run first innings lead. In the second innings, Brown top-scored with 113. He combined with Bradman to add 154 runs for the second wicket as the match petered into a draw. In a patient and restrained display, Brown took four hours to make his century. Following his controversial selection for the tour, Brown was attempting to justify his position in the team by accumulating a large number of runs, but earned criticism for being too dour. However, the century was enough to see him retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Former Test leg spinner and teammate Bill O'Reilly—who was in England as a journalist—criticised the selection of Brown, who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that despite Brown's unbeaten double century in his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey had better claims to selection.\nSecond Test.\nAustralia won the toss and batted first at the home of cricket. Centurion Morris fell at 3/166 and new batsman Miller was trapped lbw for four shortly after. Brown came in at 4/173 and helped Lindsay Hassett rebuild the innings after the two quick wickets. Both men scored slowly, averaging more than three and half minutes for each run. After putting on a partnership of 43, Hassett was bowled by Yardley, who then trapped Brown for 24 to leave Australia stumbling at 6/225. Brown had hit two consecutive half-volleys off his pads through the leg side for four, and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery. However, this third delivery came off the pitch more quickly and beat Brown for pace. Australia managed to avoid further collapse a counterattack from the tail saw them to 350 before they bowled England out for 215. The tourists batted much more productively in the second innings in ideal weather on the third day. Brown joined Miller after Bradman fell at 4/329; Australia had lost 3/33 but steadied to reach stumps at 343 without further loss, with Brown on seven. After the rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs and six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. Just ten minutes after the start, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, with Australia at 4/409. In 88 minutes of play, Australia had added 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Alec Coxon after lunch without adding to his score for 32, after an 87-run partnership with Miller, with the score at 5/416. Bradman eventually declared at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. The home team lost wickets regularly and fell for 186 to lose by 409 runs. Although part of a successful team, Brown was unable to replicate the centuries he made in each of his two previous Tests at Lord's on the preceding tours, and it was to be the last Test of his career.\nThe next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Test. Brown injured a finger while fielding in the first innings, so he was unable to bat in Australia's first innings. In the second innings, Australia's makeshift openers Harvey and Sam Loxton chased down the 122 runs for victory to complete a 10-wicket win in less than an hour.\nDropped.\nBrown was rested for the following match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test. Loxton scored 159 not out, featuring in two century partnerships and propelling Australia to 7/774 declared, which was its highest score of the tour and laid the foundation for an innings victory. Loxton's effort was enough to oust Brown from his middle-order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford. According to O’Reilly, Brown had appeared out of place in the middle-order because he was used to the opener's classical role of defending against and wearing down the opening bowlers, rather than attacking. During the Test, which was drawn, Barnes was injured and off spinner Ian Johnson was used as a makeshift opener as Morris was the only specialist left after Brown's omission. Afterwards, Brown managed only eight as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.\nBarnes was still unavailable for the Fourth Test, but Brown was not recalled to open with Morris; instead, Hassett was promoted to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. Although Hassett failed with only 13 and 17 in his two innings, Harvey struck 112 in the first innings, before Australia chased down 404 on the final day to set a world record for the highest successful run-chase in Test cricket and won by seven wickets.\nBrown partnered the recovered Barnes and patiently scored 140, before being the fifth man out with the score at 344, as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings immediately after the Fourth Test. Looking to regain his Test position by sheer weight of runs, Brown started slowly; Barnes made 24 of the first 29 runs. He took 185 minutes to reach 50, much to the displeasure of the restless spectators, before accelerating and scoring his next 50 runs in 37 minutes.\nIn the next match against Glamorgan, Brown scored 16 in a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. He scored 33 and seven in the following match, falling both times to the leg spin of Eric Hollies as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Brown was then rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. He returned for the non-first-class match against Durham, scoring 49 out of Australia's 282 in a weather-affected draw that failed to reach the second innings. Brown was overlooked for selection in the Fifth Test at The Oval. Barnes returned to the team and Australia crushed England by an innings and 149 runs to take the series 4–0 after cutting them down for only 52 in the first innings.\nLater tour matches.\nSeven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Brown top-scored with 106. After putting on 64 with Morris for the first wicket, he put on 104 each for the next two partnerships with Bradman and Harvey respectively, before falling at 3/272. Brown again batted slowly; he took 255 minutes to reach triple figures and was greeted by ironic clapping as he slowly accumulated runs while his partners attacked. Brown's dismissal triggered a collapse; Australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361. Despite this, they completed another innings victory. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, which was held at Lord's, Brown scored 120, featuring in a 180-run second wicket partnership with Bradman, as Australia amassed 5/610 and won by an innings. Former Australian Test opener and batting partner Jack Fingleton said \"Brown has always looked the class batsman that he is when playing at Lord's, and this superb century, so different in conception and execution to the one at Canterbury [against Kent], made one reflect what a grand opening batsman this series of Tests had done without\". Fingleton made a duck in the next match but Australia nevertheless defeated Somerset by an innings and 374 runs. He then made 13 against the South of England in his last first-class match of the season. The match was washed out, but not before Brown took 4/16 from 4.1 overs in his only first-class bowling effort of the tour, cleaning up the tail.\nAustralia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, the team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six England players from the season's Tests be allowed to compete. After his opponents had finalised their team, Bradman fielded a full-strength team, and Brown missed out. The match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.\nThe tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, Brown was rested as the Australians claimed an innings victory. In the second match, Brown scored 24 not out batting at No. 8 and took a wicket in the second innings as Australia ended the tour with another innings victory.\nRole.\nAn experienced right-handed opening batsman, Brown was on his third campaign in England, having first toured in 1934 before the World War II. However, Brown's best years were lost to the war and by 1948, Barnes and Morris had risen above him in the pecking order and become Australia's first-choice opening pair. Brown was selected as the reserve opener, a decision that generated controversy among pundits who believed he was past his best.\nDuring the tour matches, which were usually played consecutively with only one or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio of openers, so one would generally be rested while the other two opened,N- but in the Tests, Morris and Barnes were preferred. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the middle order in the first two Tests and against Worcestershire and the MCC, when he fielded the strongest XI. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and after making 73 runs at 24.33 in the first two Tests, he was dropped.\nNevertheless, Brown was successful in the tour matches when he played as an opener. He ended the tour with eight centuries and a total of 1,448 first-class runs at an average of 57.92, behind only Bradman, Hassett and Morris in the runs and averages, with a highest score of 200 against Cambridge University. Brown's tally of eight centuries was second only to Bradman, and took his tally on English soil to 18 first-class tons. Excluding the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests, in which Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 batting in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, Brown scored 1,324 runs at 66.20 while opening in the other matches, which would have put him in a clear fourth place on the batting averages. Following his omission from the Test team midway through the tour, Brown batted in a slow and conservative manner in order to score more runs and regain his position, much to the chagrin of the crowds.\nA very occasional off spinner, Brown took 4/16 against the South of England in his only first-class bowling assignment of the tour. It was his best career bowling figures—he accumulated only six wickets in his first-class career. He also took 18 catches in the first-class fixtures.\nNotes.\nStatistical note.\nn-[1]\nThis statement can be verified by consulting all of the scorecards for the matches, as listed here."

        "title": "Sid Barnes with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Sid Barnes was a key member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948. The team went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\". A right-handed opening batsman, Barnes was part of Bradman's first-choice team and played in four of the five Tests—he missed one match due to injury—partnering the left-handed Arthur Morris.\nBarnes ended the first-class matches with 1,354 runs at a batting average of 56.41 including three centuries, placing him fifth in the aggregates and sixth in the averages among the Australians. Barnes found his best form in the Tests, yielding 329 runs at 82.25, ranking him third in the aggregates and second in the averages. He scored half-centuries in both innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge, before compiling a hard-hitting 141 in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's, helping to set up victory in both matches. In the Third Test, Barnes was injured and hospitalised after being hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot. He returned the next day and attempted to bat, but collapsed again and had to be taken back to hospital for an extended stay, missing two weeks of cricket. After missing the Fourth Test, Barnes returned to score his third half-century for the series as Australia completed a 4–0 win with an innings victory in the Fifth Test.\nAside from his run-scoring, Barnes, who was well known for being eccentric, gained fame throughout the season for his fielding at short leg—just a few metres from the batsman—where he took 19 catches for the season. Barnes stood much closer than others who fielded in the position, placing one foot on the edge of the pitch. His extreme proximity prompted questions about the legitimacy of his action and English captain Norman Yardley later admitted Barnes had intimidated his batsmen.\nBackground.\nBarnes had been a regular member of the Australian cricket team since World War II and was on his second trip to England after making his Test debut there in 1938 before the war. During the 1946–47 Australian season, which saw England tour for five Tests, the home nation's senior opening batsman Bill Brown was injured. Barnes and debutant Arthur Morris had averaged 73.83 and 71.85 respectively, playing in all five matches.\nBarnes went to England in the Australian winter of 1947. In his autobiography, he claimed to have gone as a representative for an alcohol company, although appears to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply due to rationing. Once in England, he was approached by Burnley to play as a professional in Lancashire League cricket, which he did briefly before becoming disinterested and resigning. Barnes returned to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen to win a place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, as the Australian authorities frowned on those who played professionally in England. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian Board of Control's rule that wives were not allowed to travel with players, by being in the same overseas country.\nBrown, Barnes and Morris shared the opening duties against the visiting Indians; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. With Brown recovered, the Australian selectors dropped Barnes for the first two Tests against the Indians. However, Brown struggled and made only 18 and 11 runs—Australia batted once in both Tests—and was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morris—whose place was secure—was rested for the Fifth and final Test to give Brown another chance to show that he was worthy of selection. Barnes made 33 while Brown made 99 run out as Australia completed a 4–0 series win. In the end, all three were selected for the England tour, though Barnes had to give assurances about the amount of contact he would have with his wife—still living in Scotland—before he was confirmed. As specialist opening batsmen, the trio were competing for the two opening positions in Bradman's first-choice team.\nBarnes brought along half a tonne of baggage on the sea voyage to England, including a lot of food and drink, particularly alcohol, which was scarce due to the war and subject to rationing. There Barnes would sell his goods. During the journey, the players had to sign autographs on 5,000 sheets of paper with the team list. Barnes had a stamp of his signature made, and paid a young boy drinks to deal with the sheets, but he landed himself in trouble with captain Don Bradman and manager Keith Johnson when the boy stamped the sheets erratically, sometimes not adjacent to Barnes's position on the team list.\nEarly tour.\nAustralia traditionally fielded its strongest possible team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Barnes opened with Morris, while reserve opener Brown batted out of position in the middle order. The hosts won the toss and batted first, and Barnes took the last two catches as Australia dismissed them for 233. He delivered nine overs with his leg spin and was the most economical Australian bowler, conceding ten runs without taking a wicket. When Australia batted, Barnes made 44 from 104 balls in 99 minutes before being the first batsman to fall at 1/79.N- Australia reached 462 and dismissed the hosts for 212 to complete a victory by an innings and 17 runs. During the second innings, Barnes took his first wicket for the tour, having Laddy Outschoorn caught behind by Don Tallon to spark a collapse that saw the home side lose their last five wickets for 47 runs. Barnes ended with 1/25 and took two catches in the second innings; all four of his catches for the match were from spinners.\nMorris was rested for the following match against Leicestershire, so Barnes partnered Brown at the top of the order. The pair put on 46 before Brown fell. Barnes then put on 111 with Bradman for the second wicket before falling for 78 at 2/157 to a leg before wicket (lbw) decision the tourists regarded as a clear error. Unhindered, Australia made 448 and won by an innings. Barnes took two catches in the first innings, both from spinners, and bowled four overs without success in the second innings. The Australians proceeded to play Yorkshire at Bradford, on a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling. Bradman rested himself and Barnes as Australia came closest to losing a match for the whole tour. The tourists were 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory—effectively seven wickets down with one injured player—before scraping home to win by four wickets.\nBarnes returned for the subsequent fixture against Surrey at The Oval in London, where Australia won the toss and batted first. Barnes attacked immediately, and put on an opening partnership of 136 with Morris, before the latter fell. Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 for the second wicket before Barnes fell for 176. The tourists continued to build on the foundation laid by the top order and were eventually bowled out for 632. Bradman's bowlers dismissed Surrey for 141 and 195 to win by an innings after enforcing the follow on. During the match, Barnes was involved in an oft-recalled incident. After a series of Australian appeals had been turned down in the match against Leicestershire by umpire Alec Skelding, Barnes had remonstrated with him and told him he had problems with his eyesight. Barnes also complained about Skelding adjudging him lbw, saying the ball \"wouldn't have hit another set of stumps\" and telling the umpire to get a guide dog. A stray dog ran onto the field during the Surrey game. It caused a stoppage in play by evading the players and police for a few minutes. Eventually, Barnes used the ball to bait and trap the dog, which he then presented to Skelding stating: \"You must need a dog. You're blind when you give those decisions [against Leicestershire] not out\" and \"Now all you want is a white stick\". Skelding refused the offer, and after Barnes continued to pressure him into taking the dog, he called for an adjournment and left the playing arena. Barnes later wrote \"Strange how I suggested he find himself a canine companion at Leicester ... and then one turned up ... Cricket's a funny game.\"\nBarnes was rested for the following game against Cambridge University, which Australia won by an innings. In the next match against Essex, Barnes returned as Australia elected to bat first and went on to score a world record of 721 first-class runs in one day. Barnes opened with Brown and they laid the platform for the record-breaking total by combining for a stand of 145 before Barnes was out for 79 attempting a late cut. It was Australia's largest opening partnership on the tour to date and lasted 97 minutes. After completing their innings, the tourists proceeded to victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the summer. In the first innings, Barnes fielded at point-blank range at silly mid-on when Ray Smith was batting against the bowling of Ernie Toshack. Smith hit one ball past Barnes, narrowly missing his head, but the Australian vowed to continue standing in close proximity. In the next over, Smith drove a full ball from Toshack directly into Barnes's foot, who managed to hide any pain despite the ball having enough momentum to ricochet all the way to the boundary. The subsequent delivery was hit straight at Barnes's torso. Barnes reacted fast enough to get his hands on the ball, but it broke through and hit his chest before rebounding. He was able to grab the ball with one hand and Smith was out; Barnes then told the stunned batsman \"I told you you wouldn't drive me away\". Later, Barnes's torso and foot had to be attended to. Barnes finished off the match by trapping Peter Smith for 54 in the second innings after Australia enforced the follow on, claiming the last wicket to end a tidy spell of 1/11 from 9.4 overs. Barnes was rested for the following fixture against Oxford University, which resulted in another innings victory.\nThe following match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were almost a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Bradman chose Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown continued out of position in the middle order. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. For players on both sides, it was a chance to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests. Australia won the toss and batted and Morris fell with the score at 1/11. Barnes added 160 for the next wicket with Bradman before falling for 81 with the score at 2/171. Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings; Barnes caught John Deighton and Jack Robertson and took 0/15 from four overs. During the match, Barnes again gained attention for placing himself extremely close to the batsman when fielding at short leg, with one foot on the edge of the cut strip. According to retired Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton, himself a former fielder in the leg trap, \"[Barnes's position] was the closest I have ever seen any fieldsman on the leg side\". Bradman had suggested Barnes do so when leading English batsman Len Hutton was playing, in an attempt to distract or intimidate him. Barnes later claimed he was at little risk as Hutton was reluctant to hook Australia's pace bowlers towards him and preferred to duck bowling aimed at his upper body. He said Hutton often talked pessimistically to teammates and that the Australians would benefit if they dampened Hutton's confidence. Although Hutton top-scored in both innings, scoring 52 and 64, Barnes said the batsman's eyes betrayed discomfort. The theatrical Barnes also decided to test the umpire's patience by hovering his foot over the pitch, as though he were about to place it down on the batting surface, which was against the laws of cricket. Umpire Frank Chester, who was also known for his flamboyance and penchant for making himself visible, at one point held up proceedings momentarily when Barnes feigned to put his foot on the surface as the bowler was preparing to deliver the ball.\nEngland and MCC captain Norman Yardley later admitted Barnes's close proximity throughout the season had a psychological effect on his batsmen, although the Australian did miss catches because he was too close to react to the oncoming ball.\nThe MCC match was followed by a draw against Lancashire at Old Trafford; this was the first time the tourists had failed to win since arriving in England. Barnes made 31 in both innings after the first day was washed out; the match ended in a draw. Barnes was rested in the subsequent match against Nottinghamshire, which saw a second consecutive draw. He returned for the next game against Hampshire, as Australia had another scare. On a drying pitch, the hosts dismissed Australia for 117 in reply to 195; this was the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead on the tour. Barnes made 20. Hampshire fell for 103 in their second innings to leave Australia a target of 182, which was reached to seal an eight-wicket win, despite Barnes falling for a duck. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex and Barnes was rested as Australia dismissed the hosts for 86 and replied with 5/549 declared before completing another innings victory.\nFirst Test.\nHaving overcome food poisoning leading up to the match, Barnes was selected for the First Test at Trent Bridge, as were the other two openers in the squad. England elected to bat first, and Australia's fast bowlers reduced the home side to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first afternoon. In Australia's reply, Barnes partnered Morris at the top of the order, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. The pair had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play. Barnes made an appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Bill Edrich. Barnes walked down the pitch and was reported to have casually muttered to umpire Frank Chester \"Eh, the light!\", which appeared to shock the official. During the previous Ashes series in Australia in 1946–47, Barnes continuously appealed against the light, forcing cricket authorities to limit the batting team to one appeal, after which only the umpire can call off play, at his own prerogative. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball attack of Edrich and Alec Bedser to reach stumps at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on 6. Despite the appeal against the light, the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 runs from his two overs. However, Barnes had been fortunate, edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon.\nIdeal batting conditions and clear skies greeted the players on the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.\nBarnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was out for 31 after two hours of batting. Bradman came in and Yardley set a defensive field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The hosts' captain packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Barnes reached his half-century after 135 minutes at the crease with a pull for four from Charlie Barnett. The score progressed to 121 before Barnes cut Jim Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. The ball bounced away, but the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Umpire Ernest Cooke was unsure of whether Barnes had hit the ball into the ground before Evans took the catch, and consulted with Chester, who had been standing at point on the other side of the field, before ruling the batsman out. Keith Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to leave Australia's total at 3/121. Australia went on to reach 509 all out on the third day, yielding a 344-run first innings lead.\nWith leading paceman Ray Lindwall injured, Australia's bowling stocks were stretched and Barnes was brought on during England's second innings and as the fifth bowler to give the others some time to rest. Barnes delivered five overs and conceded 11 runs. In foggy and misty conditions, Joe Hardstaff junior brought up England's 200 with a firmly-struck hook that almost hit Barnes, who was standing at point-blank range at short leg and could not duck before the ball went past.\nEngland were eventually out for 441 on the final day, leaving Australia a target of 98. Bradman's men progressed quickly at the start of the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, including three boundaries, whereas Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell for nine. Bradman came to the crease and fell for a duck after 12 minutes in the middle. This left Australia at 2/48; dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came; Lindsay Hassett joined Barnes and they took the tourists to the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes gave Jack Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary and ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing the match was over. He tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and realising his mistake; Hassett proceeded to hit the winning run. Barnes ended unbeaten on 64 with 11 boundaries; he scored prolifically with his square cut. The next morning, he perused all the newspapers, expecting to be heavily rebuked by analysts for reckless batting on the final day, but they instead focused on his captain's failure to score.\nBetween Tests, Barnes played in the match against Northamptonshire, which started the day after Trent Bridge. Barnes made 11 and bowled three wicketless overs as Australia cruised to victory by an innings. In the second match—a drawn fixture against Yorkshire—before the Second Test, Barnes managed only a duck—bowled at the start of the match by a swinging yorker from Ron Aspinall—and six.\nSecond Test.\nAustralia opted to field an unchanged lineup for the Second Test at Lord's, the home of cricket. Before the match, Barnes wagered £8 at 15/1 on himself to score a century, and trained especially diligently in the lead-up to the Lord's fixture. He was motivated because the Australian Board of Control had given his wife rare permission to attend the match, and the refusal of the authorities at Lord's to allow him to practise there when he was in London a year earlier; Barnes saw a strong personal performance as an ideal response to what he regarded as a snub. On the first morning, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, and Barnes continued his run of low scores since the First Test. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to complete a maiden. The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Len Hutton at short fine leg. Barnes tried to knock the short delivery through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton, and leaving Australia at 1/3. They eventually reached 350 and bowled England out for 215 early on the third day.\nThe weather was fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon. On the second ball of the innings—bowled by Bedser—Barnes got off the mark to avoid his pair. Coxon took the new ball at the other end and Barnes and Morris saw it off. In contrast to their English counterparts, the Australian opening pair began cautiously, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls which were not going to hit the stumps, establishing a solid start for themselves. Keen to win his bet, Barnes was particularly determined. He survived a stumping opportunity from Laker when he was 18; he came down the pitch and the ball bounced out of the footmarks past the bat and narrowly missed the leg stump, but Evans fumbled the ball, which went away for four byes, giving Barnes a life. Barnes took advantage of the let-off to combine with Morris for an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes in an attempt to disrupt the Australian pair. Morris stopped shuffling, while Barnes adopted a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to attack the off spin of Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been bowled or trapped leg before wicket (lbw) while trying to force off breaks into the leg side from the crease. On this occasion, he drove Laker into the pavilion for six and Australia reached 0/73 at the luncheon adjournment with Barnes on 25, an overall lead of 208.\nAfter lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper played and missed a few times before settling down. Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing his hand on his chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.\nBarnes lingered for a further ten minutes on 96 before reaching his century with a straight drive from Laker. He had taken 255 minutes and hit ten fours in reaching triple figures. Having registered his century and fulfilled his bet, Barnes became particularly aggressive. He stepped out of his ground to attack Laker, but missed, as did Evans, who was unable to stop the ball as it spun down the leg side. Barnes dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, including two consecutive shots over the long on boundary and two fours. Barnes was finally removed for 141, caught on the boundary by Cyril Washbrook from the bowling of Yardley. He struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings and the speed of his batting had allowed Australia to reach 2/296 in 277 minutes after a 174-run partnership with Bradman. Hassett was bowled first ball, so Miller came to the crease at 3/296 to face the hat-trick ball. He survived a loud lbw appeal to deny Yardley his hat-trick; Australia consolidated and eventually declared at 7/460 on the fourth day.\nEngland faced a target of 596, which would have required a world record Test run-chase—no team had successfully chased down more than 400 for victory. Early on, Washbrook pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes in the nose in his customary short leg position. Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 to win by 409 runs and take a 2–0 lead.\nThe next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Test. After 16 days of cricket in 20 calendar days, Barnes was rested as Australia completed a 10-wicket win. Barnes returned for the following game against Gloucestershire. The tourists elected to bat first and Barnes—playing many square cuts—made 44 in an opening partnership of 102 with Morris, who went on to top-score with 290. Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest score for the tour, laying the groundwork for a victory by an innings and 363 runs. When Australia was fielding, Barnes was not at his characteristic close-range position, but spent much of the time at third man or fine leg near the edge of the playing arena. At times, Barnes wandered about aimlessly between various positions, but Hassett, captaining in place of the resting Bradman, did not attempt to command him.\nThird Test.\nThe teams reassembled at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped Brown, who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings in his unfamiliar position in the middle order. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and England made 363. Barnes caught his first victim for the Test series, the diminutive debutant opener George Emmett, who was surprised by a rising ball from Ray Lindwall. Emmett took his eyes from the ball and fended with one hand on the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms; the ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett's bat, rebounded gently up in the air to Barnes, leaving England at 2/28. Barnes dropped two catches later in the day, but neither cost Australia substantially. Jack Crapp hit Ernie Toshack to Barnes at short leg, who failed to hold the catch. However, Crapp did not capitalise and was out soon after. During the same middle session, Yardley hit Toshack to Barnes, who was again unable to complete the reflex catch. However, Yardley was dismissed shortly after for 22. Tail-ender Dick Pollard came to the crease on the second morning and pulled a ball from Ian Johnson into the left ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg, almost on the edge of the cut strip. According to Fingleton, Barnes \"dropped like a fallen tree\", and a minority of spectators loudly celebrated the injury. Briefly paralysed on his left side, he had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination.\nAustralia came out to bat halfway through the middle session on the second day, after England had ended on 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only one specialist opener, Morris. Johnson—a bowler—was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener and fell for one. On the third morning, Barnes came out to bat upon Keith Miller's dismissal at 4/135, even though he had collapsed from the aftereffects of his injury while practising in the nets. Barnes had refused to stay in hospital and returned to the ground despite his ribs being discoloured from the bruising. Bradman was not aware of Barnes's collapse in the nets, but had told all rounder Sam Loxton to bat before Barnes to give the bruised opener more rest. Loxton told Barnes of Bradman's wishes, but when Miller was dismissed, Barnes defied team orders and walked out to bat, shaking Pollard's hand at the start of his innings.\nHe made a painful single in 25 minutes of batting before it became too much. The bruising severely restricted his mobility and breathing, and he turned down a single after being called through by Loxton, who had come in at the fall of Morris. Soon after, the pair took a single, and Barnes collapsed after completing the run. Barnes was taken from the ground with the assistance of Bradman among others, and sent back to hospital to recuperate for several days. He took no further part in the match, which ended in a rain-affected draw; Johnson again fell for single figures in the second innings. After the Test, Barnes—still injured—missed the ten-wicket victory over Middlesex at Lord's. The match was Australia's only fixture between Tests.\nFourth Test.\nThe teams headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test, with Barnes still unfit. Australia made two changes for the match. Neil Harvey came in for Barnes, while Ron Saggers replaced Don Tallon—who had a finger injury—behind the stumps. \"Wisden\" commented that the England batsmen welcomed the freedom brought by the absence of Barnes from the forward short leg position. Brown was not recalled to open; instead, Hassett was promoted to the top of the order to partner Morris, while the teenager Harvey slotted into the middle-order. Hassett struggled, making 13 and 17, but Australia nevertheless completed a world record Test run-chase of 3/404 to seal the series with a seven-wicket win.\nBarnes returned from injury after two and a half weeks on the sidelines immediately after the Fourth Test. He made 24 as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings. He delivered 14 overs in the second innings, taking 0/6, the most economical figures in the match apart from one bowler who bowled a solitary maiden. When Australia fielded, a point of interest for onlookers was where Barnes would field; he stayed at mid-wicket, well clear of the batsman. Barnes made 31 in the next game against Glamorgan, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. After being given out lbw to Allan Watkins, he walked off visibly showing his displeasure at the umpiring decision, believing the ball would have missed leg stump. The hosts fell for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.\nBarnes was rested as Bradman's men defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. He returned as the tourists faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on tour. Barnes top-scored in the first innings with 67, putting on an opening stand of 123 with Morris as Australia made 321. He continued his productivity with 90 in the second innings, adding 161 for the second-wicket with Bradman. The home side managed to hang on for a draw, seven wickets down in their second innings. Barnes was then rested for the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Australia made 282 and had the hosts at 5/73 in reply when rain washed out the match after the first day.\nFifth Test.\nAustralia headed south to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes resumed his opening position, while Hassett returned to his customary position in the middle order. England won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Ray Lindwall's 6/20, Australia skittled England for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon.\nIn contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the overcast skies cleared and the sun came out. Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking less than an hour to push the Australians into the lead. O'Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove \"the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle\". The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field. Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. They took the score to 117 before Barnes was caught behind from Eric Hollies for 61, ending a 126-minute stand. Barnes stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the ball. Australia finished at 389 on the second day and bowled out the hosts for 188 in the second innings, sealing victory by an innings and 149 runs to complete a 4–0 series win.\nLater tour matches.\nSeven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England undefeated. Barnes was rested as Australia defeated Kent by an innings immediately after the Fifth Test. In the subsequent game against the Gentlemen of England, Barnes made only 19 before Australia declared at 5/610 against a team with eight Test players. Barnes sent down a total of eight overs for figures of 0/28 as Australia went on to complete an innings victory. Barnes made 42 before retiring ill in the next match against Somerset. Having batted first, the tourists went on to declare at 5/560 and won by an innings and 374 runs. In the following match against the South of England, Barnes made a duck. Australia declared at 7/522 and bowled out the hosts for 298 before rain ended the match.\nAustralia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current England Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After his opponents had finalised their selection, Bradman fielded a full-strength team; the only difference from the Fifth Test team was Johnson's inclusion at the expense of Doug Ring. The Australian bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Barnes put on 102 with Morris before the latter fell for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the pair put on 225 for the second wicket. Barnes finished with 151, including 15 fours and 4 sixes, after throwing his wicket away to Laker's bowling, and Australia declared at 8/469. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.\nThe tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Barnes made five as Australia scored 236 in the first match. He then bowled nine overs—including seven maidens—and conceded nine runs as Australia won by an innings. Barnes was rested for the second match, which also ended in an innings victory.\nRole.\nBarnes played in four of the five Tests as a right-handed opening batsman, partnering the left-handed Morris, although he batted at No. 6 in the Third Test due to his rib injury. Three opening batsmen were taken on the tour, Brown being the third. During the tour matches, which were usually played consecutively with one or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio, generally to rest one from the match while the other two opened.N- Notable exceptions occurred in the first two Tests, the opening match against Worcestershire and the warm-up match against the MCC. In those matches, Australia fielded its first-choice team and as a result, Brown played out of position in the middle order while Morris and Barnes opened. An occasional leg spin bowler, Barnes delivered only 65.4 overs during the first-class matches, five of which were in Tests. He took two wickets, both outside the Test arena.\nBarnes ended the first-class tour with 1,354 runs at 56.41 including three centuries, placing him fifth in the aggregates and sixth in the averages among the tourists. Barnes's form peaked in the Tests, scoring 329 runs at 82.25; among the Australians he ranked third in the aggregates and second in the averages.\nAn eccentric and strong-willed character who was not afraid to go against convention, Barnes stationed himself as close to the bat as possible when fielding at either forward short-leg or silly point. The tour report in the 1949 edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" judged Barnes's fielding to be as important as his batting in the team's success: \nHowever, Barnes received criticism for this approach, including from Fingleton, who fielded there during his playing career. A letter was published in English newspapers, questioning Bradman on whether Barnes's position was legitimate—the writer thought Barnes's close proximity yielded an unfair advantage over the batsmen. Bradman later touted Barnes as the best fieldsman he had seen in the position, while England skipper Yardley admitted Barnes had worried the home team's players. Fingleton said that if the position was unfair, then it was the umpires' duty to take action. He further said the batsmen should have tried to deter Barnes from standing so close by aiming shots at him, deeming the Australian to be \"of great value in a nuisance capacity throughout the tour\". After several near-misses, he was finally hit in the Third Test and missed two weeks of cricket, but he was not injured again after his resumption. Barnes took 19 catches for the season, although only one came in the Tests.\nAftermath.\nBarnes used the opportunity of travelling around England to pursue his business interests, cutting many deals. When he was rested from the first match against Yorkshire, he stayed in the capital and made deals at the London Exhibition. During breaks in play, or when Australia was batting and he had already been dismissed, he often spent the time inspecting local factories and talking to other businesspeople. An important concern for Barnes, when returning to Australia by boat after the tour, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included fine English cloth, which was in very short supply in Australia. Hearing a rumour that customs officers were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee. Upon returning to Australia, Barnes opted out of first-class cricket to focus on business interests. He wrote a newspaper column, in which he often criticised cricket administrators and the small share of revenue they gave to players. Barnes wrote in a confrontational manner, often lampooning and angering the authorities.\nAt the beginning of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.\nThe Board had a secret dossier documenting Barnes's behaviour and they doctored the minutes of the meeting at which they discussed his selection. The matter came to a head when a letter attributed to man named Jacob Raith was published in the paper, criticising Barnes's character, and praising the board, which prompted Barnes to sue with the intention of prising out an explanation for his omission. Cricket administrators were called to testify about the matter and more details became public. According to cricket historian Gideon Haigh, \"it was effectively the Board, not Raith, in the dock\".\nKeith Johnson, the team manager during the 1948 tour, became the centre of attention. He wrote and had always claimed that the touring party had been completely harmonious and loyal. A series of administrators came forward to say Barnes had misbehaved on the 1948 tour, even though Johnson's official report had made no mention of any problems. There were also positive reports. Aubrey Oxlade, the chairman of the board, said the batsman's indiscretions were \"childish things\" and \"not serious at all\". Frank Cush, another board member who had supported Barnes's inclusion, replied \"none at all\" when asked if there were any legitimate reasons for excluding Barnes. Selector Chappie Dwyer said \"I have a very high opinion of him as a cricketer ... and I have no objection to him as a man\".\nJohnson was called as a witness, and under questioning, a different story came out. Johnson agreed that his written report of the 1948 tour had said the team behaved \"in a manner befitting worthy representatives of Australia\" and that \"on and off the field their conduct was exemplary\". However, in a verbal report, Johnson said he had drawn the board's attention to various misdemeanours by Barnes during the 1948 tour that, in his opinion, were sufficiently serious to warrant the player's exclusion from future Australian Test sides. Johnson said Barnes had shown a \"general reluctance for anything savouring of authority\". The misdeeds included taking pictures as the Australian team was presented to the royal family on the playing arena during the Second Test at Lord's, asking permission to travel alone in England—Barnes' family was living in Scotland at the time—and \"abducting\" twelfth man Toshack to play tennis during the match at Northamptonshire on a court \"300 yards from the pavilion\". Under cross-examination, Johnson said that Barnes's photography of the royal family at Lord's was the most serious incident. He admitted he had not known that Barnes had received permission to take the photos. Barnes's lawyer then established that his client had then shown the films to raise money for various charities. He further showed that Barnes had not agitated when reminded of the policy against players meeting with family members on tour. However, Johnson believed the cumulative effect of the misdeeds \"warranted omission from the team\", and he saw no problem in the fact that his verbal advice to the board recommending Barnes' exclusion was at odds with the written report on the 1948 tour. Under cross-examination, Johnson admitted that \"I don't always write what I think\", and ended up being embarrassed by Barnes's lawyer. The case collapsed on its second day, after Barnes was issued with a public apology regarding the letter. After the libel trial, Johnson resigned from all cricket administration, while Barnes continued to be overlooked. Although the court case portrayed \"an awful image of the chaos and bigotry under which Australian cricket was administered\", it did little to alter the board's culture towards players.\nNotes.\nNotes on statistics and scoring conventions.\nn-[1]\nThis notation means that one wicket was lost while 79 runs were scored.&lt;br&gt;\nn-[2]\nThis statement can be verified by consulting all the scorecards for the matches, as listed here."

        "title": "The Swimming Hole",
        "text": "The Swimming Hole (also known as Swimming and The Old Swimming Hole) is an 1884–85 painting by the American artist Thomas Eakins (1844–1916), Goodrich catalog #190, in the collection of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth, Texas. Executed in oil on canvas, it depicts six men swimming naked in a lake, and is considered a masterpiece of American painting. According to art historian Doreen Bolger it is \"perhaps Eakins' most accomplished rendition of the nude figure\", and has been called \"the most finely designed of all his outdoor pictures\". Since the Renaissance, the human body has been considered both the basis of artists' training and the most challenging subject to depict in art, and the nude was the centerpiece of Eakins' teaching program at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. For Eakins, this picture was an opportunity to display his mastery of the human form.\nIn this work, Eakins took advantage of an exception to the generally prudish Victorian attitude to nudity: swimming naked was widely accepted, and for males was seen as normal, even in public spaces. Eakins was the first American artist to portray one of the few occasions in 19th-century life when nudity was on display. \"The Swimming Hole\" develops themes raised in his earlier work, in particular his treatment of buttocks and his ambiguous treatment of the human form; in some cases it is uncertain as to whether the forms portrayed are male or female. Such themes had earlier been examined in his \"The Gross Clinic\" (1875) and \"William Rush\" (1877), and would continue to be explored in his paintings of boxers (\"Taking the Count\", \"Salutat\", and \"Between Rounds\") and wrestlers (\"Wrestlers\").\nAlthough the theme of male bathers was familiar in Western art, having been explored by artists from Michelangelo to Daumier, Eakins' treatment was novel in American art at the time. \"The Swimming Hole\" has been \"widely cited as a prime example of homoeroticism in American art\". In 2008, the art critic Tom Lubbock described Eakins' work as:\nTitle and composition.\nEakins referred to the painting as \"Swimming\" in 1885, and as \"The Swimmers\" in 1886. The title \"The Swimming Hole\" dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work \"The Old Swimming Hole\", in reference to the 1882 poem \"The Old Swimmin'-Hole\"; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, \"Swimming\".\nThe painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast.\n The composition is pyramidal. The figure reclining at left leads the viewer's eye to the seated figure, whose gesture in turn points to Godley at the apex of the compositional pyramid. The diving figure at right leads to the swimming form of Eakins, who painted himself into the scene and whose leftward movement directs attention back into the painting. Eakins enforces this pyramidal structure by manipulating the focus of the painting: the center area containing the swimmers is extremely precise, while the outer areas are diffuse, with \"virtually no moderating zones in between\". The lighting within the picture is unnatural—too bright in some places, and too dark in others—although the effect, which tends to accentuate the body lines of the swimmers, is generally subtle.\nThe composition is notable for both its adherence to academic tradition (the mastery of the figure as an end in itself), and its uniqueness in transposing the male nude to an outdoor setting. The depiction of someone diving into water was very rare in the history of Western art. The other figures are artfully arranged to imply a continuous narrative of movement, the poses progressing \"from reclining to sitting to standing to diving\"; at the same time, each figure is carefully positioned so that no genitalia are visible. As in his previous works, Eakins chose to include a self-portrait, here as the swimmer at bottom-right. Unlike his appearances in \"The Gross Clinic\" or \"Max Schmitt in a Single Scull\", here the artist's presence is more ambiguous—he may be seen as companion, teacher, or voyeur. The ripple in the water next to Eakins, and the bubbles around the diver, are the only indications of movement in a painting where motion is otherwise arrested; the water next to the red-headed figure in the lake is still enough to offer a clear reflection. This contrast underscores the tension in the picture between classical prototypes and scientific naturalism.\nThe positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the \"Dying Gaul\", and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was \"Scène d'été\", painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.\nIn Eakins' oeuvre, \"The Swimming Hole\" was immediately preceded by a number of similar works on the Arcadian theme. These correspond to lectures he gave on Ancient Greek sculpture and were inspired by the Pennsylvania Academy's casts of Phidias' Pan-Athenaic procession from the Parthenon marbles. A series of photographs, relief sculptures, and oil sketches culminated in the 1883 \"Arcadia\", a painting that also featured nude figures—posed for by a student, a nephew, and the artist's fiancée—in a pastoral landscape.\nStudie.\nEakins made several on-site oil sketches and photographic studies before painting \"The Swimming Hole\". It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced or vice versa (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day).\nBy the early 1880s, Eakins was using photography to explore sequential movement and as a reference for painting. Some time in 1883 or 1884, he photographed his students engaged in outdoor activities. Four photographs of his students swimming naked in Dove Lake have survived, and bear a clear relationship to \"The Swimming Hole\". The swimmers are seen in the same spot and from the same vantage point, although their positions are entirely different from those in the painting. None of the photographs closely matches the poses depicted in the painting; this was unusual for Eakins, who typically adhered closely to his photographic studies. \"The divergence between these sets of images may hint at lost or destroyed pictures, or it may tell us that the photographs came first, before Eakins' mental image had crystallized, and before the execution of his first oil sketch. The poses in the photographs are more spontaneous, while those of the painting are deliberately composed with a classical \"severity\". Although no photographic studies have survived that would suggest a more direct connection between the photographs and the painting, recent scholarship has proposed that marks incised onto the canvas and later covered by paint indicate that Eakins made use of light-projected photographs.\nEakins combined his studies into a final oil sketch in 1884, which became the basis for the finished painting. The basic composition remained unchanged, as all six men and the dog appeared in the sketch; however, Eakins, who usually adhered closely to his sketches when developing a final work, made several uncharacteristic alterations to the specific movements and positions of the figures. A friend and student, Charles Bregler, described the process:\nCommission and reception.\nThe painting was commissioned in 1884 by Edward Hornor Coates, a Philadelphia businessman who chaired the Committee on Instruction at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where Eakins taught. Coates intended to pay Eakins $800 ($ in dollars), which at the time was the largest commission Eakins had been offered.\nCoates intended the painting for an exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and it was shown at the academy's exhibition in the fall of 1885. However, Coates rejected it as unrepresentative of Eakins' oeuvre. In a November 27, 1885 letter to Eakins, Coates reasoned:\nIt is not known precisely why Coates failed to purchase the painting; however, it seems likely that Coates felt the work was too controversial to acquire. Coates, as Head of Instruction at Eakins' academy, would have been familiar with the subject matter of Eakins' works, and thus it seems unlikely that the nudity in the painting would have surprised or shocked him. Rather, it seems certain that Coates would have recognized the majority of men in the painting, as all but one were students of Eakins at the academy. He was undoubtedly familiar with the site depicted in the painting too, as it was only a half a mile (800 m) from Haverford College, where Coates studied as an undergraduate. The depiction of a professor and his students together in the nude would have been a sensitive subject for the academy's directors, who had forbidden Eakins from using Academy students as models, as modeling was considered indecent. Coates chose to exchange \"The Swimming Hole\" for the \"less controversial genre scene\" of Eakins' \"The Pathetic Song\"—today housed in the Corcoran Gallery of Art—and paid Eakins the $800 he had offered for the original commission.\nOn February 9, 1886, Eakins was forced to resign from the academy because of his removal of a loincloth from a male model in a class where female students were present. In a letter to Coates on February 15 in which Eakins explained his reasons for resigning, he addressed the issue of nudity in his artwork:\nProvenance.\nFollowing its rejection by Coates, the painting remained in Eakins' possession until his death. It was exhibited just twice more during Eakins' lifetime: at the 1886 Southern Exposition in Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1887 at Chicago's Inter-State Industrial Exposition, and ignored by critics on both occasions. The painting then disappears from the historical record—there is no further reference to the painting in any records from Eakins or his circle of friends during Eakins' lifetime. Following Eakins' death, the painting was exhibited in Philadelphia and New York at memorial exhibitions in 1917.\nIn 1925, \"The Swimming Hole\" was purchased from the artist's widow by the community of Fort Worth, Texas for $750 ($ in dollars). Thereafter it was in the collection of the Fort Worth Art Association, the institutional predecessor of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, and was displayed in the city's public library. In 1990, the museum announced it intended to sell the painting to build an endowment for the purchase of contemporary art. A public outcry ensued, prompting the museum to search for a local buyer. Eventually, after tumultuous negotiations, the Amon Carter Museum of American Art agreed to purchase \"The Swimming Hole\" for $10 million ($ in dollars).\nRestorations.\nBefore its purchase by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, \"The Swimming Hole\" appears to have undergone seven different conservatory treatments. It may have been restored prior to its inclusion in Eakins' memorial exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1917. A photograph from that time reveals cracks in the glazes and a drip mark, possibly caused by the splash of a caustic liquid. After the painting was acquired by the Fort Worth Art Association, it was often lent out for exhibitions and was damaged as a result. In 1937 it was relined by a private gallery in New York City and the drip was painted out. In 1944 it was relined and restored and in 1947 it was restored again, both times by a private New York dealer. The Brooklyn Museum performed two minor restorations in 1954 and 1957. Although it continued to travel frequently, \"The Swimming Hole\" received no comprehensive treatment until 1993.\nFollowing its purchase by the Amon Carter, in June 1993, Claire M. Barry and staff from the Amon Carter and the Kimbell Art Museums began a major restoration of the painting. According to Barry, \"The restoration revealed relatively little significant damage or deterioration not previously visible. Several layers of discolored varnish and overpaint were removed, exposing a rich and varied surface with brushwork ranging from the controlled, almost miniaturistic strokes forming the figures to the freer treatment of the landscape elements.\"\nMuch effort went into distinguishing the original glazes from those added during subsequent restorations. Previous retouches were removed and a natural resin varnish was applied. The painting's original frame, long missing, was located in 1992. It too was cleaned, restored, and reinstalled to the painting.\nDuring the restoration, it was discovered that a long-standing ascription of the painting's date to 1883 was the result of a misinterpretation: the artist's original inscription of 1885 was painted in a fugitive red-lake pigment that had faded, and was mistakenly repainted by a conservator to the earlier date.\nInterpretation.\n\"The Swimming Hole\" represented the full range of Eakins' techniques and academic principles. He used life study, photography, wax studies, and landscape sketches to produce a work that manifested his interest in the human form. Lloyd Goodrich (1897–1987) believed the work was \"Eakins' most masterful use of the nude\", with the solidly conceived figures perfectly integrated into the landscape, an image of subtle tonal construction and one of the artist's \"richest pieces of painting\". Another biographer, William Innes Homer (1929-2012), was more reserved and described the poses of the figures as rigidly academic. Homer found inconsistencies in paint quality and atmospheric effect, and wrote that the painting was unsuccessful in reconciling antique and naturalistic ideals. For him, \"it is as though these nudes had been abruptly transplanted from the studio into nature\".\nBefore the mid-19th century, the subject of the nude male figure in Western art had long been reserved for classical subject matter. In the 19th century, it was not unusual for boys and men to swim without clothing in public, but there was no precedent for this subject in American painting. Although there was an informal convention for multiple-figure compositions featuring female nudes, in America such paintings were exhibited in saloons rather than galleries; Eakins altered the gender and presented the subject as fine art. Viewed in a broader context, \"The Swimming Hole\" has been cited as one of the few 19th-century American paintings that \"engages directly with a newly emerging European tradition\"—that of the male bather. Eakins' picture, although not as stylistically progressive as the works of his French contemporaries, parallels the novel thematic direction taken by Bazille in \"Summer Scene\", Georges Seurat (1859–91) (\"Bathers at Asnières\", 1884) and Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) in his numerous explorations of the subject.\nEakins' work influenced the subsequent generation of American realists, particularly the artists of the Ashcan School. George Bellows' (1882–1925) \"Forty-two Kids\", painted in 1907, bears obvious similarity to \"The Swimming Hole\", although Bellows' painting has been interpreted as a parody of the Eakins, and the many naked children of the title are playing in the urban Hudson River of New York City rather than in a rural setting. In a sentiment that reflected Eakins' philosophy, Bellows later explained his motivation for painting \"Forty-two Kids\": \"Prizefighters and swimmers are the only types whose muscular action can be painted in the nude legitimately.\"\nEakins' widow's retitling of the picture after his death reinforced the popular association with the nostalgic sentiment of Riley's poem. More recently, the painting's subject has been compared to the poem \"Song of Myself\" by Walt Whitman (1819–92), particularly section 11, \"\", given the shared interest in the imagery of men bathing in the nude. Whitman may have provided inspiration: the celebration of nudity, which in Whitman's case was an open expression of his homosexuality, informs the art of both men. In 1895, one of Eakins' male students reminisced about \"us Whitman fellows\", which has been interpreted as a reference to homosexuality. \"But for their marital status, however, virtually nothing concrete is known of the private realms or sexual propensities of any of the men depicted (in \"The Swimming Hole\"), with the exception of Eakins.\"\nAlthough the painting has been viewed as a platonic vision of the male nude seen unselfconsciously in a natural setting, by the 1970s some American writers were beginning to see Eakins' work, and specifically \"The Swimming Hole\", as having homoerotic implications. Critics have paid particular attention to the compositional prominence of the standing figure's buttocks, which has been interpreted as suggestive of \"homoerotic interests\". According to Jonathan Weinberg, \"The Swimming Hole\" marked the beginning of homoerotic imagery in American art. Eakins left a record simultaneously provocative and ambiguous on matters of sex. On the basis of the same visual evidence, that of the photographs, oil sketches, and the finished painting of swimmers, art historians have drawn markedly varying conclusions as to the artist's intent."

        "title": "Bill Johnston with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Bill Johnston was a key member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948. The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches during the English summer; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\".\nJohnston was a left-arm bowler who engaged in fast bowling when the ball was new and conducive to pacemen, before reverting to orthodox spin when the ball became old. He was Australia's third fast bowler in the Tests, reinforcing the new ball attack of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, who were regarded as one of the finest pace pairings of all time. Bradman typically used Miller and Lindwall in short bursts against the English batsmen with the new ball. The hosts had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than usual. This allowed the Australian pacemen more frequent use of a shiny ball that swung at high pace. Johnston typically delivered pace after the Lindwall and Miller had first use of the new ball, before resorting to spin later in the innings. In order to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh, Bradman had Johnston deliver the most overs by any bowler.\nJohnston was the equal-leading wicket-taker in the Tests (27 along with Lindwall) and Australia's most prolific wicket-taker in the first-class matches with 102. The latter feat made him the last Australian to take a century of wickets on an Ashes tour. In recognition of his achievements, Johnston was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. \"Wisden\" said \"no Australian made a greater personal contribution to the playing success of the 1948 side\".\nBackground.\nDuring the Australian summer of 1947–48, Johnston played in four of the five Tests against India. He was a major part in Australia's 4–0 series win; the second highest wicket-taker with 16 scalps, Johnston had the best bowling average of 11.37. Ray Lindwall led the wicket-takers with 18. As a result, Johnston was selected for the 1948 tour of England. During the trip, Johnston roomed with Doug Ring who was a teammate in the Richmond and Victorian cricket teams. As Ring was a leg spinner, he and Johnston were in direct competition for a place in the playing XI.\nEarly tour.\nAustralia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. When Johnston was omitted for the opening match, it appeared he would not be in Bradman's Test plans. Australia went on to win by an innings, setting the tone for their tour.\nBradman brought Johnston into the team for the second tour match against Leicestershire. He made 12 runs and was the last man out as Australia ended on 448. After a lower order collapse of 5/38 against the local spin attack, Johnston came in and put on 37 in partnership with Keith Miller, allowing his colleague to reach his double century. Johnston bowled six wicketless overs for 15 as the hosts fell for 130. Made to follow on, Leicestershire made 147 to lose by an innings. Johnston took his first wicket of the tour, trapping Jack Walsh leg before wicket (lbw) to end with 1/42 from 27 overs. Johnston played a leading role in Australia's victory in the next match, against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling. In this match, Johnston resorted to bowling left arm orthodox spin. The hosts elected to bat and he bowled almost unchanged, sending down 26 of the 54.3 overs, 14 of which were maidens. He took 4/18 as Yorkshire were bowled out in difficult batting conditions for 71. His wickets included batsmen Alec Coxon and Willie Watson, who went on to become England Test cricketers. The match remained finely balanced after Australia made 101, with Johnston unbeaten on five. He was again miserly in the second innings, bowling 15.2 overs with seven maidens and taking 6/18. His victims included leading English batsman Len Hutton, and Coxon and Watson for the second time as the hosts were bowled out for 89. Johnston had ended the match with 10/40. After collapsing to 6/31—effectively seven wickets down as Sam Loxton was injured and unable to bat—Australia scraped home by four wickets. It was the closest Australia would come to defeat for the whole tour.\nThe tourists travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval, and they amassed 632 after batting first. Johnston bowled without success in the first innings. In the second innings he claimed both openers to reduce the hosts to 2/11 after Bradman had forced them to follow on. He returned later in the innings to remove Alec Bedser and Jim Laker, ending with 4/40 as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Johnston was rested for the following match against Cambridge University, which Australia won by an innings.\nJohnston returned as Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the summer. After setting a world record for the most number of first-class runs in one day’s play (721), of which Johnston contributed nine, Bradman’s men bowled Essex out for 83 and 187 after enforcing the follow on. Johnston managed a match total of only 1/36. This was followed by another innings victory, this time over Oxford University. After scoring 13 in Australia's 431, Johnston bowled the most overs by an Australian in the match, taking 2/40 and 2/44 across a total of 42 overs.\nJohnston was the left out for the next fixture, which was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team, with Johnston omitted. It was a chance for the Australian bowlers to gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrich—three of England's first four batsmen—all playing. Australia won by an innings to give an indication of their strength.\nFour county matches remained before the Tests, giving the players more chances to press their claims for selection. Johnston was recalled for Australia'a first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. After the first day was washed out, Johnston made 24 in a 25-run ninth-wicket partnership with wicket-keeper Ron Saggers, which took Australia from 8/170 to 9/195. The tourists were eventually bowled out for 204. During his innings, Johnston swung lustily and hit three sixes. In reply, Lancashire reached 4/144 before Johnston took five of the last six wickets to help dismiss the home side for 182, securing a slender lead for the tourists. Johnston ended with 5/49 from 29 overs, the most by any of the Australians, and was not required to bat in the second innings.\nJohnston was rested for the subsequent match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, which was drawn. He returned against Hampshire and played a major role in Australia's eight-wicket win. The home team were put into bat on a drying pitch by vice-captain Lindsay Hassett—Bradman had rested himself for the match. Johnston bowled for almost the whole innings, sending down 38.4 of 85.4 overs. He took wickets at regular intervals to end with 6/74 as Hampshire were bowled out for 195. Johnston was unbeaten on two as Australia lost 8/47 and collapsed to 117 all out, trailing by 78 runs. It was the first time that the tourists had conceded a first innings lead for the season. In the second innings, Johnston bowled unchanged at his end for the entire innings, providing steady breakthroughs to end with 5/43 as Hampshire were bowled out for 103. This left Australia a target of 182, and they batted fluently in their second innings to win by eight wickets. Johnston ended with match figures of 11/117. He was rested in the innings win over Sussex, in the last fixture before the First Test.\nFirst Test.\nJohnston was not in Bradman's planned Test team. However, the Australian skipper changed his mind on the morning of the First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket. Johnston had taken 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on similar surfaces. He showed his credentials by taking a match total of 9/183 from 84 overs to help Australia to grind out a victory by eight wickets. England elected to bat first and after strike bowler Ray Lindwall broke down on the first day, the burden on Johnston grew.\nEngland had reached 2/46 when Johnston was brought into the attack for his first over. He bowled Bill Edrich, knocking out the off stump while the batsman was on the front foot. Two balls later, Johnston removed Joe Hardstaff junior without scoring, caught by Miller in slips after attempting a cut shot; the catch was described by \"Wisden\" as \"dazzling\". Miller dived and balanced himself on his spine before catching the ball to leave England at 4/46. Journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly said: \"Johnston had trimmed and embroidered the efforts of his opening bowlers and had swung the fortunes of the game completely in Australia's favour\".\nJohnston then knocked over Charlie Barnett's stumps as the batsman leaned onto the front foot and inside edged the ball into his stumps for eight; this brought Godfrey Evans—who was given two lives—to the crease at 6/60. Evans hit Johnston hard in the air to cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second catching opportunity went in the same direction before traveling through Bradman's hand and striking him in the abdomen. However, Johnston eventually snared Evans, who hit a ball strongly, but straight to short leg where Arthur Morris took the catch close in, as England reached 8/74.\nHowever, a rearguard action took England to a total of 165, before Johnston removed Alec Bedser to end the innings. Johnston finished with 5/36, in a display characterised by his accuracy and variations in pace and swing. When Australia batted, Johnston and Ernie Toshack wagged a last-wicket partnership of 33 runs in only 18 minutes. They played in a free-wheeling manner before Bedser trapped Toshack lbw to end the home team’s innings on 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead and Johnston unbeaten on 17.\nJohnston took the new ball with Miller and delivered 59 overs in the second innings to take 4/147 in Lindwall's absence. Johnston bowled without success in the first half of the innings; the closest he came to a wicket on the third afternoon when Len Hutton and Denis Compton were putting on a century partnership was when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point. On the fourth day, England continued to make steady progress and Johnston was unsuccessful although he was able to make the ball move sideways in the morning under cloudy conditions. He was then attacked by Hardstaff, who drove several fours through the off side and forced Bradman to remove Johnston. He returned to remove Barnett and English captain Norman Yardley late on the fourth day as the hosts’ neared 300. Barnett was caught by Miller in the slips and Johnston took a return catch to remove the English skipper. Johnston bowled 30 overs, the most of any bowler for the day, as England reached the penultimate evening on 345/6, a lead of one run. The next morning, Johnston removed Evans and bowled Jack Young to end England's innings at 441 on the final day. Johnston bowled the most overs of any player and was the leading wicket-taker for the match as Australia took a 1–0 lead—the Australian batsmen reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand.\nAfter the First Test, Johnston was the leading wicket-taker as Australia completed an innings victory over Northamptonshire. He took 3/25 in the first innings, before dismissing the home side's top four batsmen in the second innings to reduce them to 4/108; they were eventually bowled out for 169. Johnston ended with 4/49. This was followed by a drawn match against Yorkshire, in which Johnston scored an unbeaten 15, before bowling almost unchanged in the home side's first innings. Johnston bowled 41.1 out of 90.1 overs and ended with 3/101, including the wickets of Test players Alec Coxon and Watson. The match ended in a draw. Johnston bowled three overs for 15 in the second innings; Bradman chose not to push for a win and declared late in the second innings so that his bowlers would not have to exert themselves to any significant extent before the next Test.\nSecond Test.\nIn the Second Test at Lord's, Australia batted first and Johnston scored his Test career best of 29 in another tail-wagging performance in the first innings. After coming to the crease with the score at 8/275 on the second morning, Johnston added 45 runs with wicket-keeper Don Tallon before the latter fell to Bedser. He was joined by last man Toshack and they put on 30 before Johnston was stumped—having overbalanced while leaning onto the front foot and trying to hit a ball for six—from the bowling of Doug Wright to end Australia's innings at 350. Both Johnston and Toshack threw the bat at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions compared to where they had aimed their shots. Both men—not known for their batting ability—played without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck. One sequence of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls being unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers.\nWith Keith Miller injured and playing purely as a batsman, Johnston took the new ball, sharing it with Lindwall. He was unable to take a wicket initially, but the English openers were uncomfortable when he and Lindwall were taking the new ball. Following the tea break, he returned with the second new ball after Compton and Yardley had put on an 87-run partnership to stabilise the middle-order. Johnston took Compton's outside edge and Miller completed the catch in slips. The left armer then claimed Evans, caught by a diving Miller after the Englishman had taken a swing of the bat wide outside off stump; this left the hosts at 7/145. Johnston ended with 2/43 from 22 overs as England were bowled for at 215 early on the third morning. After Australia declared at 7/460 on the fourth afternoon to leave the home side a target of 596, Johnston troubled the English openers with the new ball, but did not take a wicket.\nLindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Fielding in the slips, Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before the English batsman had scored. Johnston usually moved the ball into the right-handed batsmen, but on this occasion the ball went straight on and took the outside of the edge of Hutton's bat. Hutton had trouble with both Australian pacemen, and played and missed multiple times in the deteriorating light. In a fidgety display, he played loosely outside the off stump and missed four times in one Johnston over, before Lindwall dismissed him.\nYardley’s men resumed at 3/106 on the final day. On the second ball of the final morning, bowled by Johnston, Compton aimed a square drive, but the delivery was Johnston's variation ball, which went away instead of into the batsman. The ball flew off the outside edge to a diving Miller, who knocked the ball up before falling on his back and completing the catch as the ball came down. Compton stood his ground and waited for the umpire to confirm whether Miller had caught the ball cleanly, and was duly given out by the unhesitating official. O'Reilly described Miller's effort as \"perhaps the very best slips catch of the whole series and … a real match-winner.\" Johnston then removed Bedser for nine to end with 2/62 as Australia won by 409 runs and took a 2–0 series lead.\nAfter 16 days of cricket in 20 days, from the First to the Second Test, Johnston was rested from the next two matches against Surrey and Gloucestershire, which Australia won by ten wickets and an innings respectively.\nThird Test.\nJohnston returned for the Third Test at Old Trafford, where the home team elected to bat first. In an effective containing performance, Johnston took 3/67 from 45.5 overs in the first innings. England had looked assured in the first hour, before Johnston—again taking the new ball with Lindwall—bowled Cyril Washbrook with a yorker to leave England at 1/22. Johnston had been bowling from over the wicket, and his left-arm deliveries had generally been swinging back into the right-handed Washbrook. However, the opening batsman did not detect Johnston’s variation ball, which was released from wide of the crease and angled across more sharply without curling back in. Washbrook played inside the line of the ball, which hit his stumps. Australia nearly had two wickets in the same over as the new batsman Edrich struggled. He played loosely outside the off stump to the first ball from Johnston but did not get an edge, and on the third delivery, Edrich survived again. Receiving a ball on middle and leg stump, he tried to defend it straight back down the pitch, rather than the conventional stroke to the leg side, and managed to edge the ball past the slips for four. Johnston repeatedly hurried Edrich with his pace, forcing the batsman to make many last-moment movements to either hit the ball or withdraw from a shot during the formative stage of his innings.\nJohnston returned with the second new ball after lunch to remove Tom Dollery with another yorker, leaving England at 4/97. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook’s in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston’s variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none. Late in the day, Johnston took the catch as Lindwall removed Evans, who had taken a wild slash to leave England at 7/216. In the final minutes of play, Johnston extracted an edge from Compton on 64, but Tallon dropped the catch. On the second morning, Tallon dropped Compton—then on 73—for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston, who eventually ended the England innings on 363 by removing Young. Compton had added a further 81 after being dropped from Johnston's bowling to end unbeaten on 145. Johnston had bowled the most overs of the Australians and been the most economical.\nIn reply, Australia were in trouble at 7/208 when Johnston came to the crease to join Lindwall, with five more runs needed to avoid the follow on. As Sid Barnes was unable to bat due to injury, Australia were effectively eight wickets down. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow-on before Bedser removed both. Johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from Dick Pollard in the direction of Edrich at first slip, but Evans dived across, trying to catch the ball at full stretch in his right hand. The wicket-keeper could not hold onto the ball, and the resulting deflection further to the right wrong-footed Edrich, who was moving the other way, and it went past him. From second slip, Jack Crapp dived left behind Edrich but the ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers. However, in the next over Bedser, Johnston edged the ball in the same manner and Crapp caught the ball easily. Johnston was out for three as Australia ended with 221 to narrowly avoid the follow on by eight runs. He was wicketless in the second innings, taking 0/34 as England declared at 3/174 and set Australia 317 for victory on the last day after the fourth day was completely washed out by rain. The match ended in a draw with Australia at 1/92, after many rain interruptions.\nJohnston played in Australia's only match before the Fourth Test, which was against Middlesex. He dismissed Jack Robertson, Edrich and John Dewes to leave the hosts at 4/92 and ended with 3/43 as they were bowled out for 203. In the second innings, he took two early wicket—including Compton—to reduce the hosts to 3/27 before ending with 2/28 as Australia bowled Middlesex out for 135. Bradman’s men went on to win by ten wickets.\nFourth Test.\nIn the Fourth Test at Headingley, England batted first on a pitch regarded as being ideal for strokeplay, and Australia's bowlers had little success on the first day. Early in the day, Johnston appeared to be having back problems. He had bowled the most overs of any bowler on the tour and his loss would have meant a heavy workload for his remaining colleagues. His apparent discomfort led onlookers to opine that he should have been given more rest in the county matches. After an opening partnership of 143, England consolidated to reach 1/268 in the last over of the day before Johnston removed Washbrook for 143. Johnston did not taste further success in the first innings and ended with 1/86 from 38 overs as the home team ended on 496, their highest score of the series.\nIn reply, Australia were still more than 100 runs behind when Johnston joined Lindwall with the score at 8/355, late on the third day. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling, dominating the stand of 48 with Johnston, who made only 13. Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before the injured Ernie Toshack survived the last 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston running for him. Despite Toshack and Johnston’s lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so he faced most of the balls. Johnston able to survive against the English pacemen with relative ease when he was batting, leading O’Reilly to lament the absence of leg spinner Doug Wright, whose guile and flight was held in high regard by the Australians. Lindwall was the last man out on the fourth morning with the total on 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings.\nAustralia lost the services of Toshack after he broke down with a knee injury in the first innings, increasing the burden on the remaining bowlers as England sought to extend their lead on the fourth day. For the second time in the match, Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership. After reaching 50, Washbrook hooked a short ball from Johnston and top edged it, but Bradman failed to take the catch. However, Washbrook soon repeated the shot from the bowling of Johnston with fatal results. The ball again went in the air, and Neil Harvey quickly ran across the ground and bent over to catch it at feet height while on the run, removing the opener for 65. Fingleton said that Harvey’s effort \"was the catch of the season—or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [in the match against Surrey]\". O’Reilly doubted \"whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it\". He further said the \"hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic\".\nEngland moved to 4/277 when a mini-collapse occurred. Yardley made seven before he was removed by Johnston, caught by a leaping Harvey while attempting a big shot. Johnston then removed Ken Cranston, caught behind for a duck to leave England at 6/278. When Johnston removed Compton for 66, caught by Miller at cover, the hosts were 7/293 with no recognised batsmen remaining, having lost 4/33. England recovered to reach 8/362 at the close of the fourth day. The next day, Yardley declared at 8/365, leaving Johnston with the pick of the bowling figures, 4/95 from 29 overs. This left the tourists a target of 404 from 345 minutes. Australia went on to break the world record Test run-chase record by scoring 3/404 to take a 3–0 lead with 15 minutes to spare.\nJohnston went on to play in the match against Derbyshire immediately after the Headingley Test, taking 3/41 and 1/35 as Australia enforced the follow on and won by an innings. He was rested for the next game against Glamorgan, which ended in a rain-affected draw without reaching the second innings. Johnston returned and took 2/41 in the first innings against Warwickshire, before taking 4/32 in the second innings, including three of the last five wickets, as the hosts fell from 5/118 to 155 all out. The left armer bowled almost unchanged during the second innings, sending down 39 of the 85.5 overs, including 16 maidens. His wickets included New Zealand Test batsman Martin Donnelly and Indian and Pakistani dual international Abdul Hafeez Kardar, as Australia went on to win by nine wickets. Johnston was then rested from two consecutive matches, against Lancashire and Durham, both of which were rain-affected draws.\nFifth Test.\nJohnston rounded off his Ashes series with the Fifth Test at The Oval. English skipper Norman Yardley elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, a decision many regarded as surprising. Precipitation in the past week rendered play before midday impossible. Former Australian Test batsman and leading commentator Jack Fingleton speculated that the tourists would have bowled if they had won the toss.\nThe damp conditions meant required a large amount of sawdust to be laid down to help the players keep their grip. Along with the rain, the humid conditions assisted the Australian bowlers, who were able to make the ball bounce at variable heights.\nAfter Miller removed John Dewes with the score at 1/2, Bradman made an early bowling change and introduced Johnston. Edrich joined Hutton and they played cautiously until the former attempted to hook a short ball from Johnston. He failed to get the ball in the middle of the bat and it looped up and travelled around . Lindsay Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, after diving sideways and getting both hands to the ball. This left England at 2/10. After the lunch break, Johnston dismissed debutant Allan Watkins without scoring after the batsman played across the line to be trapped lbw, leaving England at 6/42. Johnston ended with 2/20 from 16 overs as England were skittled for 52. After being unbeaten without scoring in Australia's innings of 389, Johnston was again among the wickets when England's second innings late on the second day.\nEngland started their second innings with a deficit of 337 runs and reached 1/54 by the premature end of the second day due to bad light. The following morning, they made slow and steady progress as Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. The four men in the off side ring had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed and Johnston had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were few scares.\nThey reached 2/125 after lunch, when Compton—who was on 39—aimed a hard cut shot from Johnston's bowling, which flew off the edge into Lindwall's left hand at second slip for a \"freak slip catch\". This triggered a collapse late in the afternoon, which saw the hosts lose 4/25 to end the third day at 7/178. England resumed on the fourth morning with only three wickets in hand, still needing 159 runs to make Bradman’s men bat again. Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets, Alec Bedser, Yardley and Eric Hollies to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs. Only ten runs were added in the brief morning session; Hollies fell for a golden duck after skying a ball to Morris, immediately after Yardley became the ninth man to fall. Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs and he was the most economical of the bowlers. Given the time lost to inclement weather on the first day, Australia had won the match in less than three days of playing time. Overall, Johnston finished with 27 Test wickets at an average of 23.33, equal to Lindwall but at a higher average.\nLater tour matches.\nSeven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and made 361. Johnston then took three wickets with the new ball to help reduce the hosts to 5/16, before ending with 3/10 from six overs. Forced to follow on after being bowled out for 51 in 23 overs, Kent were reduced to 4/37 by three early Lindwall wickets. Johnston ended with 1/28 as the home team capitulated for 124 and lost by an innings. The victory over Kent was followed by a match against the Gentlemen of England. Johnston was rested as Australia completed another innings victory. He returned for the match against Somerset, which resulted in a third consecutive innings win. After Australia had declared at 5/560, Johnston took the opening wicket of Harold Gimblett before returning to take the last two scalps of the first innings from consecutive balls, bowling his finger spin. He ended with 3/34 as Somerset fell for 115 and were forced to follow on. Johnston bowled the second over of the second innings. As Johnston had taken wickets with his last two balls in the first innings, his first delivery was the hat-trick ball. Gimblett negotiated the first ball safely, before being trapped lbw for a duck on the next. Johnston had thus taken three wickets in four balls. He bowled unchanged throughout the innings to end with 5/34 from 17.4 overs as Somerset were bowled out for 71. Johnston took the final wicket to fall—Horace Hazell—trapped for a duck, which brought up his 100th first-class wicket for the tour.\nIn the match against the South of England, Johnston took 1/63—Edrich being his only wicket—after Australia declared at 7/522. Bradman’s men dismissed the hosts for 298 and rain ended the match before the second innings could start.\nAustralia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After his opponents had finalised their players, Bradman named a full-strength team. In a rain-interrupted match, Johnston bowled Edrich for 15. He ended with 1/20 as the hosts folded for 177. Johnston made an unbeaten 26 in a partnership of 30 with Lindsay Hassett as Australia replied with 8/489 declared. Time ran out with the Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75 in the second innings.\nThe tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first, Australia scored 236 before Johnston took 6/15 from 12.5 overs. He took the last four wickets as the home team fell from 6/81 to be all out for 85. Johnston bowled four wicketless overs in the second innings as Australia completed victory without needing to bat for a second time. In the second match, he signed off on his tour in a low key manner, taking a wicket in each innings to end with a match total of 2/48 as Australia completed another innings triumph.\nRole.\nJohnston played as a left-arm fast bowler when the ball was new and conducive to pace bowling, before reverting to finger spin when it became old and lost its shine. He was Australia's third fast bowler in the Tests, reinforcing the new ball pairing of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, who were regarded as one of the finest pace duos of all time. Bradman typically used Miller and Lindwall in short and sharp new ball bursts against the local batsmen. England had agreed that a new ball would be available every 55 overs, a milestone that usually came more frequently than the old regulation of 200 runs for every ball. This allowed Australia—who had the superior pace attack—more frequent use of a shiny ball, which swung at high pace. Johnston typically bowled pace after the first-choice pair had finished their new ball spell, before reverting to spin when the ball was worn. He took 27 wickets at 23.33 in the Tests, making him the equal-leading wicket-taker along with Lindwall, who averaged 19.62. The Australian pacemen’s tally was substantially more than the next best, recorded by England's Alec Bedser, who took 18 wickets at 38.22.\nIn both the Test and county matches during the 1948 tour, Johnston carried the heaviest workload, bowling nearly 200 overs more than any other squad member. He was the leading wicket-taker in all first-class matches with 102 wickets at 16.42, and the last Australian to take a century of wickets on a tour of England. His average was only slightly inferior to that of Lindwall, who took 86 wickets at 15.68. The roles Johnston fulfilled are borne out in his economy rate and strike rate. He was more economical than Miller and Lindwall, who took wickets more frequently.\nJohnston's performances prompted Bradman to call him \"Australia's greatest left-hand bowler\". As a result of his ability to bowl spin and pace, teammate Neil Harvey thought the team effectively had 13 players, saying \"we reckoned Bradman was worth two [batsmen] and Bill Johnston was worth two [bowlers]\". Harvey rated Johnston the best team man in the squad, and Bill Brown praised Johnston's work ethic in bowling for long periods after Lindwall and Miller had been given the best opportunities with the new ball. Spin bowling teammate Ian Johnson described him as \"the finest team man and tourist\" in cricket and valued his personality, while Miller described him as \"the most popular man in cricket\". Johnston sometimes amused his colleagues by demonstrating his double jointedness, wrapping his feet around the back of his neck. He was reputed to have nearly drowned when he attempted this in the communal bath at Lord's.\nAfter carrying a heavy workload in the early stages of the tour, Johnston was used more sparingly in the latter stages. As the tour progressed, Johnston improved his control and restrained England's batsmen between the new ball bursts of Lindwall and Miller. Johnston was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. \"Wisden\" said \"no Australian made a greater personal contribution to the playing success of the 1948 side\". Fingleton wrote that Australia had never sent a greater left-hander to England.\nDuring the tour, Johnston had few opportunities with the bat, invariably batting at either No. 10 and No. 11 alongside Toshack, another tail-ender with little batting ability. Neither player ever passed 30 in their first-class career, and they were the only two Australians who failed to pass 50 during the tour. As Australia's other frontline bowlers were Miller, Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all of whom scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, Toshack and Johnston were rooted at the bottom of the batting order. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings many time due to their batting strength, Johnston only had 18 innings in his 21 first-class fixtures and scored 188 runs at 18.80, the third lowest average and aggregate. He scored 62 runs in the Tests at 20.66, including his highest first-class score of 29 in the Second Test at Lord’s."

        "title": "Rugby league in the Northern Territory",
        "text": "Rugby league in the Northern Territory is administered by the Northern Territory Rugby League and is played in Darwin at Warren Park and in Alice Springs at Anzac Oval.\nHistory.\nRugby League was the fourth football code introduced to the Territory after soccer (1911), rugby and Australian rules (1916). Rugby fell out of favour in Darwin with the popularity of the NT Football Association (Australian Rules) however Rugby League was organised by the Pine Creek Railway association workers as early as 1920. During the 1920s, League's profile increased and by the 1925, matches were drawing large crowds.\nA competition was played in Tennant Creek in 1938.\nThe first organised competition was played in Darwin in 1941 when 9 teams, mostly made up of servicemen decided to make one unified competition and compete between and against each other. Some of the teams represented the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal Australian Navy, and the Australian Army. There were also teams made up of citizens in Darwin, along with a team made up entirely of indigenous Australians living in Darwin.\nThe Central Australian Rugby Football League was formed in 1942 by soldiers based in Alice Springs and competition began in 1943. It was the first football league in Alice Springs, with the now popular Aussie Rules competition not formed for another 5 years.\nThe competition was cancelled due to the bombing of Darwin and the air raid attacks on the city. Since most of the competition was made from servicemen in Darwin, the competition was severely effected when many of these personal had to go to war and when they were no longer stationed in the Darwin area.\nAnother competition resumed in 1942 and continued onto 1943 (it was a season which lasted two years) but because of the evacuation of Darwin and then the subsequent shipping out of army and navy personnel from Darwin the competition was completely halted. The Darwin Rugby League Association was formed in 1945, however went into recess shortly thereafter. In 1949, it was revived along with a new competition at Tennant Creek, the Tennant Creek Rugby Football Association was begun. However the competition was short lived and over subsequent decades, teams from Tennant Creek were instead entered into the other leagues.\nIn 1950, a small group of men, mainly ex-servicemen, joined together to form the Northern Territory Rugby League. The first official season of the reformed Darwin league was started in 1950 with a number of pre-season trial matches and tournaments. The first official match was played on 14 June 1951.\nDuring the 1960s, the Katherine District Rugby League competition began in Katherine town which has been long divided between league and Aussie Rules. However unlike other parts of the Northern Territory, there were no Australian rules football leagues there to compete with until the 1980s as a result the Katherine competition became quite well established and popular with locals.\nCyclone Tracy hit Darwin on 24 December 1974 and completely devastated Darwin. Much damaged was done to its surroundings, but little damage occurred on Richardson Park, the home of rugby league in Darwin. The cyclone had an effect on the competition itself as players and administrators of the clubs and boards of the competition either left Darwin or were involved in the clean-up in Darwin after the cyclone had subsided.\nGove Rugby League began as a development association in 1999 with a single junior club on the Gove Peninsula that remains today.\nGoverning body.\nThe Northern Territory Rugby League is responsible for administering the game of rugby league in the Northern Territory of Australia. It controls the Darwin Rugby League, Darwin Junior Rugby League and the Centralia Australian Rugby Football League.\nNorthern Territory is an affiliated state of the overall Australian governing body the Australian Rugby League.\nLeagues.\nCentral Australian Rugby Football League (1943–).\nFoundation teams are Wests Dragons and United Magpies.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nThe Northern Territory team play in the Affiliated States Championship along with the other three affiliated states (South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia) plus the Australian Police and Australian Defence Force. They won the title in 2004.\nThe Northern Territory competed in the Amco Cup in 1977, 1978 and 1987.\nThe Northern Territory competed in the 1977 Pacific Cup. The team had little success, winning only one of their four games. The team finished at fourth out of fifth position on the ladder. 1977 was the only time the Northern Territory made an appearance in the Pacific Cup."

Penn State, who was also undefeated before the championship, fell in the finals for the second year in a row.\nThe NCAA's expansion from 56 teams to 64 began in 1998.\nRecords.\nThe NCAA women's volleyball tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1998, joining the men's and women's basketball tournaments as the only 64-team NCAA Tournaments at the time. The NCAA baseball tournament would expand to the same size in 1999, followed by the NCAA women's soccer tournament in 2001 and the NCAA softball tournament in 2003. The Big Ten and Big 12 each earned six bids in 1998. The Pac-10 only received four bids in the 1998 NCAA Tournament, which is the fewest they have earned in the 64-team era.\nNational Semifinals.\nLong Beach State vs. Florida.\nLong Beach advanced to the finals easily, taking the 10-0 lead in the opening game before winning 15-2. Florida staved off seven game points in the second game before falling 15-8. Long Beach then won a closer third game to sweep the Gators.\nMisty May put down 11 kills and had two service aces, while Jessica Alvarado led the 49ers with 12 kills.\nPenn State vs. Nebraska.\nLauren Cacciamani had 20 kills, Christy Cochran had 19 and the three-time all-American Bonnie Bremner had 13 to help Penn State beat No. 3 Nebraska in four games. The Huskers ended their season 32-2 while Penn State improved to 35-0 and advanced to the program's third title match.\nNational Championship: Long Beach State vs. Penn State.\nLong Beach took the first two games easily, 15-3 and 15-10. However, like the 1997 NCAA championship, Penn State took the next two games to force a fifth game.\nIn the decisive rally-scoring fifth game, Penn State led 7-2, but Long Beach tied it up at 8. Tied at 12, Long Beach State's Jessica Alvardo put down two kills before Veronica Wall's 19th kill of the night ended the match, 15-12. Long Beach State's Misty May, also the AVCA National Player of the Year, was named the co-MVP of the Championship along with Penn State's Lauren Cacciamani.\nNCAA Tournament records.\nThere are two NCAA tournament records that were set in the 1998 tournament."

        "title": "Swimming at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre freestyle",
        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle event at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place on 22 September at the Jamsil Indoor Swimming Pool in Seoul, South Korea. There were 77 competitors from 51 nations. Nations had been limited to two swimmers each since the 1984 Games.\nAmerican Matt Biondi set a new Olympic record to claim his first ever individual gold and fourth medal in swimming at these Games (fifth in his career, with a relay gold in 1984). Maintaining a lead from start to finish, he pulled away from a star-studded field to hit the wall first in 48.63. Biondi also enjoyed his teammate Chris Jacobs taking home the silver in 49.08, as the Americans climbed on the top two steps of the podium for the sixth time in the event's Olympic history. Earlier in the prelims, Jacobs sliced off Rowdy Gaines' 1984 record by six-tenths of a second to establish a new Olympic standard of 49.20 in the eighth heat, until Biondi eventually lowered it to 49.04 in the final of ten heats. Meanwhile, France's Stéphan Caron held off an intense sprint battle against Soviet duo Gennadiy Prigoda and Iurie Başcatov to take home the bronze in 49.62.\nBackground.\nThis was the 20th appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nThree of the eight finalists from the 1984 Games returned: two-time bronze medalist Per Johansson of Sweden, fifth-place finisher Dano Halsall of Switzerland, and sixth-place finisher Stéphan Caron of France. Caron was also the runner-up in the 1986 world championships behind Matt Biondi of the United States.\nBiondi had come to Seoul with the goal of matching Mark Spitz's seven gold medals in a single Games. That goal had already been frustrated by the time of the 100 metre freestyle (his best race), as his first three events had resulted in only one golds along with a silver and a bronze. Biondi still had an excellent chance of achieving as many gold medals (5) as anyone not named Spitz had before 1988, however, with the 100 free, 50 free, and two relays to go, though Kristin Otto was on her way towards 6 golds in Seoul as well.\nGuam, Senegal, the United Arab Emirates, and Uruguay each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 19th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThis freestyle swimming competition used the A/B final format instituted in 1984. The competition consisted of two rounds: heats and finals. The swimmers with the best 8 times in the semifinals advanced to the A final, competing for medals through 8th place. The swimmers with the next 8 times in the semifinals competed in the B final for 9th through 16th place. Swim-offs were used as necessary to determine advancement.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nResults.\nHeats.\nRule: The eight fastest swimmers advance to final A, while the next eight to final B."

He played one season in Major League Baseball as a pitcher in 1908 for the Philadelphia Athletics.\nEarly career.\nCarter attended the University of Virginia. Carter was drafted by Athletics' owner and manager Connie Mack in 1907 after playing minor league baseball for the Syracuse Stars of the New York State League from 1903 to 1907. He was considered the best pitcher in the league that season by New York State League team managers.\nPhiladelphia Athletics.\nCarter pitched a late 1908 spring training game against the Athletics' cross-town rivals the Philadelphia Phillies and his performance was praised by the Philadelphia newspapers. Although he had never played in the majors prior to 1908, he was the Athletics' Opening Day starting pitcher on April 14, 1908, against the New York Yankees at Hilltop Park. The Athletics lost that game. For the 1908 season, and his career, he pitched in 14 games, with 5 starts and 2 complete games. He had a win–loss record of 2–5 and an earned run average of 2.97. He had 17 walks and 17 strikeouts. The \"Cameron County Press\" described Carter as \"a big husky chap\" who has \"great speed, good curves and an excellent spitter.\" \nReturn to the minor leagues.\nOn June 8, 1908, Carter gave up 7 runs in less than 4 innings in a 10–0 loss to the St. Louis Browns. A few days later Carter was sold to the Kansas City Blues of the minor league American Association. Carter pitched in 26 games for the Blues in 1908, pitching 208 innings and posting a 10–13 won-lost record.\nIn 1909 he spent the entire season with the Blues, pitching in 32 games and 229 innings, posting a 15–12 record. By 1911 he was back in the New York State League, pitching for the Elmira Colonels. He had a 10–13 won-lost record in 34 games for the Colonels in 1911. In 1913, he pitched for the Newport News Shipbuilders of the Virginia League. There he posted a 12–10 won-lost record in 28 games and 216 innings."

Foulis also designed other local courses, including the original Forest Park Golf Course as well as Normandie Golf Club, which is the oldest public course west of the Mississippi River. Ruth Park had plans to become an 18 hole facility, but that never ended up materializing. The course record of 29 (-6) was set by local legend Tile Kochtanek on July 14th 2023.\nLayout.\nRuth Park Golf Course has a unique design that uses the slightly hilly terrain. The fairways are very wide throughout, but the greens are quite small. Several holes have out of bounds to the right off the tee. The course has undergone some work as of late to improve the fairways, and the transition to completely zoysia fairways, with bent grass greens. The second, sixth, and seventh hole are tree lined.

        "text": "Charles Thomas Workman (January 6, 1915 – January 3, 1953) was an American professional baseball player. A left-handed hitter who threw right-handed, Workman played all or part of six seasons in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians, Boston Braves and Pittsburgh Pirates, most often as a right fielder or third baseman. The native of Leeton, Missouri, stood tall and weighed .\nCareer.\nWorkman entered pro ball in 1937 in the minor leagues in the Class C Middle Atlantic League. After a banner year in 1938, when he batted .364 and was named an outfielder on the Middle Atlantic circuit's All-Star team, he made his MLB debut on September 18, 1938, with the Indians at age 23. But Cleveland would only give Workman one further brief look, at the outset of the campaign, and that year he was acquired by the Nashville Volunteers, where, playing in Sulphur Dell, a haven for left-handed hitters, he would enjoy his greatest success later in the 1940s.\nAfter Workman hit .326 and led the Southern Association with 29 home runs for Nashville in 1942, the Braves obtained his services. The Braves' regular right fielder in , veteran future Hall of Famer Paul Waner, was released in January, and Workman was given the starting job, which he held in and . In 1943, he hit .249 in 615 at bats in 153 games, but the next year, Workman's batting average declined to .208 in 418 at bats in 140 games. In , Workman had his breakout year. With the Braves continuing to lose players to World War II service, a vacancy opened at third base when Dee Phillips joined the United States Army. Workman was moved to Phillips' old position, with center fielder Tommy Holmes moved to right and Carden Gillenwater brought in to play center. The change in position seemed to agree with Workman, as he hit .274 with 25 home runs, both career best marks. His home run total placed him second in the National League, and first in home runs per at bat (one for every 20.560). Workman's batting average was third-best on his team.\nBut, in 1946, Workman got off to a slow start, hitting only .167 in his first 48 at bats. The Braves traded him on June 12 to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Johnny Barrett. In Pittsburgh, Workman hit .221 in 145 at bats. It was his final season in the major leagues. However, he was able to return to Nashville in 1948 and the cozy confines of Sulphur Dell, where he won the Southern Association's Most Valuable Player Award, leading the Double-A circuit in home runs (52) and amassing 182 runs batted in, which set a new league mark. Although Workman hit .353 that year, he was 33 points behind the league's batting champion, teammate Smoky Burgess, who hit .386. The following season, Workman clubbed 41 homers for the 1949 Minneapolis Millers to lead the Triple-A American Association, but it did not earn him a recall to the majors. He played the 1950 and 1951 seasons in the minors, then retired from pro baseball.\nAs a major leaguer, Workman had a career batting average of .242 with 423 hits in 526 games, including 57 doubles, seven triples, 50 home runs, and 230 RBI. His lifetime fielding percentage was .959. Chuck Workman died from a bleeding ulcer in Kansas City, Missouri, three days before his 38th birthday."

        "text": "A golf course superintendent is a person who professionally manages the labor, time, materials and financial resources needed to care for the turfgrass and landscaped grounds on a golf course. Golf course superintendents have also been referred to as greenskeepers and turf managers. Golf course superintendents are concerned with the environmental health of the golf course, the sporting needs of the players and the financial sustainability of the golf club or country club for which they work. Golf course superintendents communicate the status of the grounds and maintenance resources to members of the club’s management, owners or board of directors, green chairs and committees, golfers, vendors, suppliers, golf professionals, golf course architects and others in the golf industry.\nGolf course superintendents monitor the natural weather patterns, environment and other influences that affect the playing areas and landscapes with which golfers interact. Golf course superintendents monitor the health of the golf course environment through study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease and injury to the golf course’s turfgrass fairways, tees and greens areas, as well as bunkers, areas of water hazard, naturalized areas and trees. Their management of the course is accomplished through a knowledge of biology, chemistry, plant pathology, and entomology. In the United States, golf course superintendents can be certified by the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America (GCSAA).\nJob responsibilities.\nGolf course superintendents maintain a course’s turfgrass, which is considered to be a manufactured product because it is specifically planted, raised and maintained to provide players with a surface on which to play golf. There is a science-based process behind the turfgrass they produce which involves various steps and stages throughout the year. \nThe maintenance of the turfgrass throughout the year requires sufficient education on the distinction between the natural state and preferred state of golf course greenery. Training in fertilizers and herbicides are necessary to understanding the dynamic between a natural environment and one that is conducive to sustaining hundreds of thousands of rounds of golf per year. Many superintendents will go to secondary education preparing them for a certification from the GCSAA, the Golf Course Supererintendents Association of America. \nThe PGA Tour sponsors a movement every year to remind golfers around the world to thank their local golf course superintendent for all the hard work they put in behind the scenes. \nSources.\n1.

Tobin played running back for one season with the Houston Oilers. He later became director of player personnel for the Chicago Bears in 1987 and the Detroit Lions in 2001 and the general manager of the Indianapolis Colts in 1994.\nEarly life and education.\nWilliam Hugh Tobin was born on February 16, 1941, in Maryville, Missouri, on a farm near Burlington Junction, Missouri, where his brother Vince was also born. Their father Ed Tobin was a basketball captain at the Conception Junction, Missouri high school. The brothers both attended Maryville High School, from Burlington Junction, but the family thought their sports prospects would be much better in the much bigger school (they commuted to the school). The brothers, who were two years apart in age, played on the football teams at the same time both in Maryville and at the University of Missouri football team. Bill played on the 1959 Maryville basketball team that was undefeated until losing the State Class M title game.\nTobin attended the University of Missouri, where he played in the Tigers' backfield next to quarterback Jim Johnson.\nCareer.\nAs a player.\nTobin was drafted in the 14th round of the 1963 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers. Instead of playing for the 49ers, he played for the Houston Oilers in the AFL for one season and then played in the CFL for a few seasons.\nAs an executive.\nTobin spent 27 years as a front office executive with the Chicago Bears, Indianapolis Colts and Detroit Lions. Tobin was involved in drafting six Hall of Famers who played for the 1985 Chicago Bears. He was named the director of player personnel for the Bears in 1987. His first draft pick as director of player personnel was Jim Harbaugh. The Bears had four playoff appearances while Tobin was director of player personnel. His tenure as Chicago's director of player personnel ended in 1992.\nTobin was the general manager of the Indianapolis Colts from 1994 to 1996. During his time with the Colts, he drafted future Hall of Famers Marshall Faulk and Marvin Harrison. He also drafted Ken Dilger, Tarik Glenn, and Adam Meadows, who would be cornerstones of the Colts offensive line, and Pro Bowl defensive backs Ray Buchanan and Ashley Ambrose. He built a team in Indianapolis that included Jim Harbaugh, who in 1995 led the NFL in passing. The Colts had a very surprising and successful run to the 1995 AFC Championship Game; the run included the first playoff win for the Colts since Super Bowl V, a span of twenty-five years. Tobin was replaced as Colts general manager in 1997 by Bill Polian.\nTobin was the director of player personnel for the Detroit Lions from 2001 to 2002.\nTobin worked as a scout for the Cincinnati Bengals for two decades. His son, Duke Tobin, is the team's director of player personnel. Tobin was the brother of former NFL coach Vince Tobin.\nMel Kiper incident.\nWhile he was the general manager of the Indianapolis Colts, Tobin gained some notoriety during the television broadcast of the 1994 NFL Draft after being criticized by ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr. for picking Nebraska linebacker Trev Alberts with the fifth pick in the draft (that year, the Colts had both the 2nd and 5th pick, with the Colts drafting Marshall Faulk prior to Alberts), instead of Fresno State quarterback Trent Dilfer. While he was being interviewed by ESPN later in the broadcast, Tobin famously said \"Who in the hell is Mel Kiper anyway?!\" Tobin later called a press conference where he ranted about Kiper for several minutes, stating that Kiper had been biased against the Colts ever since they moved from Baltimore, Kiper's home.\nDeath.\nTobin died in Indianapolis on April 19, 2024, at age 83."

Every team played each other once with the top three finishers receiving medals at the end. The USSR won in its first attempt, led by Vsevolod Bobrov who was recognized as the best forward of the tournament in the first ever presentation of Directorate Awards.\nDescription.\nThe USSR won their first five games before meeting up with the host, and defending champion, Sweden. Sweden, having already lost 8-0 to Canada, desperately needed to beat the Soviets, but settled for a 1–1 tie. The final game of the tournament pitted the East York Lyndhursts, representing Canada, against the USSR, both teams being undefeated. Tournament organizers believed the Canadians would cruise to their seventh straight win and had begun to sell tickets for a planned tie-breaking game between the Soviets and Swedes to determine the European Championship. However the Soviets \"appeared to pass too much, check too little, and skate too fast\" and \"thoroughly dominated\" in a 7–2 win before 16,000 fans.\nCanadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) president W. B. George stated that the final game was the worst he had seen the Lyndhursts play and that they seemed afraid of being penalized. The CAHA was heavily criticized by media in Canada for the failure to win the World Championships, and writer Michael McKinley stated the loss was a \"day of reckoning\" and a symbol of what went wrong with the CAHA's international strategy, and the beginning of a hockey rivalry with the Soviet Union.\nBeginning with this year the IIHF began giving out official awards (known as the \"directorate awards\") to the best forward, defensemen, and goaltender, of the tournament."

It was held at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India, from 10–16 August 2009. It was the first ever World Championships event to take place in India.\nBadminton England withdrew before the first round due to a perceived threat of terror against the team. They were later joined by two Austrian doubles players. Lin Dan won the men's singles event, thus becoming the only player in badminton history to have won three men's singles world championship titles having done so consecutively in 2006, 2007, and 2009. Lu Lan won the World Championship title in the women's singles event. Cai Yun and Fu Haifeng of China won the World Championship title in the men's doubles event in a match which was later dubbed a \"classic\". Zhang Yawen and Zhao Tingting won the World Championship title in the women's doubles event, whilst Thomas Laybourn and Kamilla Rytter Juhl of Denmark won the World Championship title in the mixed doubles event.\nHost city selection.\nDenmark, India, and Macau submitted bids to host the championships. India won the right to host the championships after the remaining candidates withdrew their bids.\nVenue.\nThe 2009 BWF World Championships were held at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium in Gachibowli, Hyderabad.\nDraw.\nThe draw took place on 22 July 2009, featuring Chief Guest and Indian Sports Minister, Dr. M.S. Gill.\nParticipating nations.\nAustria.\nDue to security worries Austrian doubles pair Peter Zauner and Jürgen Koch decided against participation in the 2009 BWF World Championships. The BWF issued a special statement calling the withdrawals \"an individual decision on the part of the players\". COO BWF Thomas Lund said: \"I believe it is a matter of concern that teams haven’t been consulting us before pulling out, because all the necessary information is available with us which will allay fears\". Lund declined to blame the Indian media for their part in the withdrawals: \"I can’t say India as hosts have any reason to be blamed for a false newspaper report with threat perceptions which triggered these reactions.\"\nDenmark.\nDenmark, who had not achieved a BWF World Championship singles win since 1999, and a men's title since 1997, took part. The country last won the men's doubles title in 2003.\nEngland.\nThe English badminton team decided against participation in the 2009 BWF World Championships, citing fears of a \"terrorist threat\", although, according to Hyderabad's police commission \"there's no real threat, only a perception\". Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy called it \"an incredibly tough decision and one we didn't take lightly\". Christy said: \"We were not prepared to risk the safety of our players, coaches and staff in what we felt could have been a very volatile environment\"."

Led by head coach Mike Anderson, Mizzou finished third in the Big 12 with a conference record of 12–4 and also won the Big 12 men's basketball tournament for the first time in school history.\nPre-Season.\nFollowing a .500 season in 2007–08 season, the Tigers revamped their offense with five freshmen and two transfers. The Tigers basketball team was not heralded with much in the way of high hopes coming into the 2008–09 season. Most preseason polls had Missouri finishing in the bottom-half of the Big 12 Conference, including Athlon Sports and the Big 12 coaches.\nAs a way to get in some much needed extra practice, coach Mike Anderson accepted an invitation to play three exhibition games in Canada in late August. In the first game of the tour, Missouri defeated the Niagara All-Stars by a score of 120–80 on August 30, 2008. The game was played at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario. On August 31, 2008, in the same venue, the Tigers defeated Brock University 117–68. This game gave the Missouri coaching staff and fans a nice look at the fresh faces, as Mizzou's seven newcomers combined for 66 of the Tigers' 117 points on the afternoon. The next morning, the Tigers closed out the Canadian trip by beating the Southern Ontario All-Stars by a final score of 109–92.\nThe Tigers played two pre-season games in 2008. The first was against Lincoln (MO), winning the game 97–54. The second of their two pre-season games was against Missouri Southern, resulting in an 87–58 Tigers victory.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=|Summer Canadian Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=|Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=|Big 12 Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=|Big 12 Tournament \n!colspan=12 style=|NCAA Tournament "

        "text": "The 2009 H.I.S. World Table Tennis Championships were held in Yokohama, Japan, from 28 April to 5 May 2009. The Chinese team dominated the competition, following their sweep of the gold medals in table tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics. It was the tenth (and third consecutive) world table tennis championships at which China won all five available titles.\nFourth-ranked Timo Boll of Germany, a challenger for the men's singles title, was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to a back injury. After Boll's withdrawal, players from China held the top four seedings in both the men's and women's singles competitions.\nThe event took place during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, with the participants being affected by this. When a case of the strain was found in the body of a seventeen-year-old schoolboy in Yokohama, where the championships were taking place, the event's organisers implemented new measures to stop the flu spreading. Thermographic exam cameras were installed at the player entrances of Yokohama Arena, with the intention of sending anyone with unusually high body temperatures for medical assistance. The players were told to scrub their hands well for hygiene reasons and to avail of face masks and hand gels which had previously been used during outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza. Participants from Mexico, the most severely affected country taking part in the championships, were placed in quarantine and given thermometers to check their temperature regularly.\nChina collected seventeen of the available twenty medals at the championships, to follow their four golds at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. After the championships had ended, the country's deputy sports minister, Cai Zhenhua questioned whether China's dominance in the sport would have a negative effect on its development. He said: \"From the point of view of the Chinese association, the coaches and the players, it is a great achievement. But personally I am anxious that it is dangerous for the development of this sport worldwide. The truth is we have failed again. Chinese players grabbing all titles in whatever tournament they participate in is definitely detrimental\". He advocated issuing invitations to non-Chinese nationals to train in the country and suggested Chinese coaches could be sent to other countries as \"up to 70 percent of Chinese knowledge and tactics could be shared with others\".\nChampions.\nAll five finals featured Chinese players only.\nMen's singles.\n Wang Hao\nWorld number one Wang Hao beat Wang Liqin in the men's singles final, China's third consecutive men's singles title and fifteenth world championship title in that section.\nWomen's singles.\n Zhang Yining\nOlympic gold medallist Zhang Yining beat her fellow countrywoman, Liu Shiwen, to win one of the women's singles semi-finals, whilst Guo Yue, the defending champion, beat Li Xiaoxia in the other semi-final. Zhang went on to beat Guo in the final, securing China's eighteenth women's singles title.\nMen's doubles.\n Chen Qi / Wang Hao\nIn the semi-finals of the men's doubles, Ma Long and Xu Xin beat Jun Mizutani and Seiya Kishikawa of Japan to play Chen Qi and men's singles winner, Hao, in the final match. Chen and Hao won the title.\nWomen's doubles.\n Guo Yue / Li Xiaoxia\nIn the semi-finals of the women's doubles, Guo and Li beat Jiang Huajun and Tie Yana of Hong Kong and Ding Ning and Guo Yan won against South Korea's Kim Kyung-Ah and Park Mi-Young.\nMixed doubles.\n Li Ping / Cao Zhen\nThe mixed doubles was won by Li Ping and Cao Zhen."

        "title": "1982 Stanley Cup playoffs",
        "text": "The 1982 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) began on April 7, after the conclusion of the 1981–82 NHL season. The playoffs concluded on May 16 with the champion New York Islanders defeating the Vancouver Canucks 3–1 to win the final series four games to none and win the Stanley Cup. This was the first edition of the Stanley Cup playoffs conducted under a format that paired teams in each round with geographical regard to conferences.\nThe first round of the 1982 playoffs saw three first-place teams (Edmonton, Minnesota, and Montreal) upset by fourth-place teams, a round which featured what is still the greatest comeback in NHL history: The Kings' 6–5 win over Edmonton in game three. After trailing 5–0 after two periods, the Kings scored five third period goals—three in the last 5:22, the final goal coming with only five seconds left in regulation. Los Angeles then scored on a face-off early in overtime, thus completing the \"Miracle on Manchester\".\nThe eventual champion New York Islanders nearly capitulated in the first round as well, losing games three and four of their first-round playoff series with Pittsburgh after crushing the Penguins in the first two games. In game five, the Islanders scored twice in the last five minutes to force overtime and then won the series on John Tonelli's goal 6:19 into the extra session. This served as a wake-up call for New York, who lost only two more games the rest of the way on their march to a third straight Stanley Cup. Their Finals opponents, the Vancouver Canucks, finished the regular season with only 77 points, defeating three teams beneath them in the standings (Calgary 75, Los Angeles 63, and Chicago 72) in the much weaker Campbell Conference. This remains the most recent time that the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs missed the playoffs in the same season.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe 1982 playoffs introduced a new format, in which the four teams with the best regular-season records from each of the four divisions secured playoff berths. The best-of-five division semi-finals saw the first-place club against the fourth-place team, while the other two teams played each other. The winning clubs would then meet in a best-of-seven division final. Home-ice advantage for these first two rounds of the playoffs were granted to the team with the better regular-season record. Division winners then faced one another in the conference finals. The two Conference Champions played for the Stanley Cup. With the exception of extending the first round to a best-of-seven in 1987, this format remained in place through the 1993 playoffs.\nHome-ice advantage for the conference finals was determined by coin flips. Occurring prior to the start of the regular season, this event determined that home-ice advantage were granted to champions of the Patrick and Norris divisions, with the Adams and Smythe division champions receiving that advantage for the following season. Similarly, a puck flip determined that home-ice advantage for the Stanley Cup Finals were granted to the Wales Conference champion this year, with the Campbell Conference champion receiving the advantage next season.\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nDivision semifinals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (A4) Quebec Nordiques.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\nDale Hunter scored the game-winning overtime goal in the decisive Game 5 twenty-two seconds into the first OT to help the Nordiques eliminate the Canadiens.\n(A2) Boston Bruins vs. (A3) Buffalo Sabres.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\n(P1) New York Islanders vs. (P4) Pittsburgh Penguins.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. New York won the only previous meeting in seven games in the 1975 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals after falling behind 3–0 in the series.\nJohn Tonelli scored the game-tying goal late in the third period and game-winning overtime goal in the decisive Game 5 to lift the Islanders over the Penguins.\n(P2) New York Rangers vs. (P3) Philadelphia Flyers.\nThis was the fourth playoff series meeting between the two teams. Philadelphia won two of the previous three meetings, including their most recent meeting in the 1980 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals in five games.\nGame two saw New York's Mikko Leinonen set an NHL playoff record with six assists, a feat only matched by Wayne Gretzky.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N1) Minnesota North Stars vs. (N4) Chicago Black Hawks.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\n(N2) Winnipeg Jets vs. (N3) St. Louis Blues.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\n(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (S4) Los Angeles Kings.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams. Game Three is known as \"The Miracle on Manchester\" as the Kings scored five goals to force overtime and ultimately winning the game in OT.\n(S2) Vancouver Canucks vs. (S3) Calgary Flames.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\nDivision finals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A2) Boston Bruins vs. (A4) Quebec Nordiques.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\n(P1) New York Islanders vs. (P2) New York Rangers.\nThis was fourth playoff series meeting between these two teams. The Islanders won two of the previous three meetings. This was a rematch of last year's Stanley Cup Semifinals, in which the Islanders won in a four-game sweep.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N3) St. Louis Blues vs. (N4) Chicago Black Hawks.\nThis was the third playoff series meeting between these two teams. Chicago won both previous meetings, including their most recent meeting in a three-game sweep in the 1980 Preliminary Round.\n(S2) Vancouver Canucks vs. (S4) Los Angeles Kings.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\nConference finals.\nPrince of Wales Conference final.\n(P1) New York Islanders vs. (A4) Quebec Nordiques.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\nClarence Campbell Conference final.\n(N4) Chicago Black Hawks vs. (S2) Vancouver Canucks.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\nCanucks Coach Roger Neilson was tossed out of game 2 for holding up a white towel on a hockey stick as a form of protest. He was ejected from the game along with two players but the protest began the Canucks Towel Power tradition that still exists to this day and has since been copied by other teams.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams. New York won the only previous meeting in a two-game sweep in the 1976 Preliminary Round.\nIn the Stanley Cup Finals, the Cinderella run of the Vancouver Canucks came to an end with a four-game sweep by the Islanders, winning their third consecutive Stanley Cup.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played.

        "text": "Joseph Andrew Martinez (born February 26, 1983) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. He played parts of four seasons for the San Francisco Giants (2009–2010), Pittsburgh Pirates (2010), Arizona Diamondbacks (2012), and Cleveland Indians (2013). Martinez threw right-handed but batted left-handed.\nA native of South Orange, New Jersey, Martinez played four years of college baseball for the Boston College Eagles. Used exclusively as a starting pitcher as a senior in 2005, he was drafted by the Giants in the 12th round of the 2005 MLB Draft. Progressing through the minor leagues, he won the 2009 Harry S. Jordan Award as the Giant who did the best in his first spring training, making San Francisco's Opening Day roster as a result. He picked up the win on Opening Day, April 7, but two days later, he suffered a concussion and three fractured bones when a line drive off the bat of Mike Cameron hit him in the forehead. The injury kept him out for several months, but he returned to the Giants later in the season. After being the Fresno Grizzlies' best starter in 2010, he was called up in mid-June when Todd Wellemeyer was injured; he made one start before being replaced by Madison Bumgarner in the rotation. Midway through the year, he was traded to the Pirates.\nAssigned to the minor leagues, Martinez did not pitch for the Pirates until September, when he made five relief appearances. He spent all of 2011 in the minor leagues for Cleveland. In 2012, he pitched in one game for the Diamondbacks, and he made two appearances for Cleveland in 2013. After a brief stint in the minor leagues for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2014, he retired. In 2022, MLB hired Martinez as their Senior Director of On-Field Operations.\nHigh school and college.\nMartinez was born in South Orange, New Jersey, on February 26, 1983. At Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, he played multiple sports at the varsity level: four years of football, three years of baseball, and two years of basketball. As a baseball player, he was twice a member of New Jersey's All-State team. He graduated in 2001 and became a member of the school's Hall of Fame in 2007.\nFollowing high school, Martinez played college baseball for the Boston College Eagles. As a freshman in 2002, he posted a 0–0 record, allowing no earned runs in 26 innings pitched. In 2003, he posted a 1–0 record with a 9.16 earned run average (ERA) in six games (two starts), pitching 18 innings. He went 2–4 with a 0.87 ERA in 15 games (seven starts) in 2004, striking out 56 batters in 52 innings. After the 2004 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was named a league all-star and posted a 2–5 record with a 2.84 ERA.\nIn Martinez's senior year of 2005, the Eagles used him entirely as a starting pitcher. On April 18, he was named the Big East Pitcher of the Week after recording 11 strikeouts while shutting out the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. He won the award for a second time on May 16 after pitching his fifth consecutive complete game, a three-hit shutout of the Pittsburgh Panthers.

Martinez allowed nine home runs that year, the third-most in the league. In 2006, he played for the Class A Augusta Greenjackets of the South Atlantic League, going 15–5 with a 3.01 ERA in 26 starts. His 15 wins and innings pitched trailed only Matt Maloney's totals for the league lead, and he also finished in the top five in starts (third) and ERA (fifth).\nIn 2007, Martinez pitched For the Class A Advanced San Jose Giants of the California League. He twice recorded 11 strikeouts, first against the Stockton Ports on May 1, and later against the Modesto Nuts on July 13. He went 10–10 with a 4.26 ERA in 28 starts. Martinez's 151 strikeouts led the league; at the same time, he walked only 36 batters. Promoted to the Class AA Connecticut Defenders in 2008, Martinez became an Eastern League All-Star. He was the league's pitcher of the week for the period ending June 23, during which he threw seven scoreless innings in a victory over the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. In 27 starts, he went 10–10, leading the Eastern League with a 2.49 ERA.\n2009.\nIn 2009, Martinez won the Harry S. Jordan Award, presented annually by the Giants to a player who exemplifies performance and dedication in his first spring training. He competed with Keiichi Yabu and Ramón Ortiz to be the Giants' long reliever. At the end of spring training, he was named to the team's Opening Day roster at the end of spring training. Martinez posted a 1.72 ERA over his final five appearances of the preseason, and Giants reliever Sergio Romo was still recovering from an elbow injury. \"We like the way (Martinez) throws,\" said Giants' manager Bruce Bochy. \"He holds runners and does all the little things on the mound. He handles the bat. He throws strikes. He has a good sinker.\"\nMartinez made his MLB debut on Opening Day (April 7), relieving Tim Lincecum after the starter allowed three runs in three innings against the Milwaukee Brewers. In what the Associated Press called a \"rocky two innings\", Martinez gave up two earned runs but picked up the victory, as the Giants took and held the lead in a 10–6 triumph. Two days later, in the ninth inning against Milwaukee, a line drive off the bat of Mike Cameron struck Martinez in the forehead, lacerating him and causing a nose bleed. He was able to walk off the field unaided, but was taken to a local hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with a concussion and three small fractures to his skull, but they expected him to make a full recovery. He spent a few days in the hospital as a precaution. Reporter Jeff Chiu called the incident \"one of the most frightening moments a pitcher can have on the mound\", adding that Martinez \"was lucky not to have been more seriously injured on the play\".\nAfter missing several months of the season, Martinez was sent to the minor leagues for a rehab assignment. All seven of his appearances were starts, as the Giants still hoped for him to be a starting pitcher. On August 5, 2009, Martinez returned to the major leagues, facing the Houston Astros in his first major league start. He replaced Ryan Sadowski in the pitching rotation. Martinez won the game, allowing three runs in five innings with no walks and four strikeouts. He made several more starts that month but failed to pitch more than five innings in any of them. On August 28, he was optioned to the Class AAA Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League after giving up eight runs the night before in an 11–0 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Martinez was recalled by the Giants on September 8 but made only two more appearances for them the rest of the year, both in relief.\nIn nine games (five starts), Martinez had a 3–2 record, a 7.50 ERA, 19 strikeouts, 12 walks, and 46 hits allowed in 30 innings pitched. He was the Giants' nominee for the Hutch Award, given annually to a player who perseveres through adversity, though Mark Teahen was the eventual winner.\n2010.\nMartinez attended spring training with the Giants in 2010, but right elbow inflammation limited him to one game, and he was optioned to Fresno on March 23. That season, \"The Fresno Bee\" reported that he was \"arguably [the Grizzlies'] best starter\". In 14 games (13 starts), he posted a 5–3 record, a 3.32 ERA, 65 strikeouts, 26 walks, and 78 hits allowed in innings pitched. Due to an injury to Todd Wellemeyer, Martinez was called up by the Giants on June 11. Starting in place of Wellemeyer against the Baltimore Orioles on June 15, Martinez pitched innings but allowed four runs in a 4–1 defeat. \"I was a little out of synch not having pitched for 10 days, but it was good enough to get a lot of ground balls that just found holes,\" Martinez afterwards described his performance. The Giants elected to use top prospect Madison Bumgarner the next time Wellemeyer's turn in the rotation came around, and Martinez was moved to the bullpen. Seldom-used, he made only four appearances (counting the start) through the trade deadline of July 31, posting an 0–1 record and a 4.91 ERA. On that date, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates with John Bowker for Javier López.\nAfter his departure, the Giants went on to win the 2010 World Series. As a member of the team that season, he received a ceremonial World Series ring, which he had to pick up from a FedEx distribution center in New Jersey.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nThe Pirates immediately optioned Martinez to the Class AAA Indianapolis Indians of the International League. In seven games (four starts), he posted a 1–2 record, a 5.72 ERA, 18 strikeouts, seven walks, and 46 hits allowed in innings. He was promoted by the Pirates on September 5. Despite Martinez's starting experience, manager John Russell said the team planned to use him as a relief pitcher. He made five relief appearances for them, recording no record and a 3.12 ERA. In nine games (one start) combined between San Francisco and Pittsburgh, he had an 0–1 record, a 4.12 ERA, nine strikeouts, nine walks, and 26 hits allowed in innings.\nCleveland Indians organization.\nOn January 4, 2011, Martinez was traded by the Pirates to the Cleveland Indians for cash considerations. He was outrighted to the International League's Columbus Clippers on February 18. In 35 games (16 starts), he had an 8–9 record, a 4.04 ERA, 101 strikeouts, 29 walks, and 136 hits allowed in 118 innings. The Clippers won the International League championship. In the Triple-A National Championship Game on September 20, Martinez threw seven innings and was named the game's Most Valuable Player as Columbus defeated the Omaha Storm Chasers by a score of 8–3. On November 2, he became a free agent.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nMartinez signed a one-year contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 5, 2011. He began the 2012 season with the Pacific Coast League's Reno Aces. On April 24, he and fellow pitcher Mike Zagurski were recalled to Arizona as Joe Paterson was sent to the minor leagues and Jonathan Albaladejo was designated for assignment. Fox Sports suggested that the Diamondbacks intended to use him as a long reliever, as Wade Miley, who had previously filled the role, was now making starts. Martinez made his lone MLB appearance of the year on April 25, giving up one run in the final inning of a 7–2 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. Five days later, he was sent back to Reno when Patrick Corbin was called up for the first time. In 27 starts for Reno, he had a 10–11 record, a 5.39 ERA, 99 strikeouts, 49 walks, and 206 hits allowed in innings. His 11 losses tied with five others for second-most in the Pacific Coast League, behind Zach Jackson's 13. On October 25, he became a free agent.\nCleveland Indians.\nMartinez re-signed with the Cleveland Indians on December 14, 2012, on a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. After opening the 2013 season with Columbus, he was added to the major league roster on June 29 when Matt Langwell was sent down. He pitched two scoreless innings in that day's game, earning the victory in a 4–3 triumph over the Chicago White Sox. \"He really clutched up...that's not the easiest situation to be put into,\" manager Terry Francona said of Martinez's entering a tied game for his first MLB appearance in over a year. Six days later, he pitched the final three innings and allowed a run in a 7–0 loss to the Detroit Tigers. Following that game, he was sent back to Columbus so the Indians could promote Carlos Carrasco. In 24 games (21 starts), he had a 3–7 record, a 5.26 ERA, 90 strikeouts, 27 walks, and 163 hits allowed in 130 innings pitched. He filed for free agency on October 1.\nOn March 4, 2014, Martinez signed with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He lost all three starts that he made for the Salt Lake Bees of the Pacific Coast League, posting a 16.36 ERA before announcing his retirement on April 21.\nCareer statistics and pitching style.\nIn 21 games (six starts) over parts of four MLB seasons, Martinez posted a 4–3 record, a 5.82 ERA, 32 strikeouts, 21 walks, and 78 hits allowed in innings. His primary pitch was a fastball, which he threw 64.9 percent of the time during his MLB career; it averaged . He also threw a curveball 26.7 percent of the time and a changeup 7.2 percent of the time; these pitches travelled around . In the two games in which he pitched in 2013, he threw the fastball less than half the time, relying more heavily on his secondary pitches, as well as a cut fastball. He threw right-handed but batted left-handed.\nPersonal life.\nMartinez's father, Javier Sr., is a teacher who came to the United States from Cuba in 1961. Martinez's mother, Toni, is also a teacher; she was employed by Columbia High School. His younger brother, Javier Jr., pitched in the Seattle Mariners organization in 2007 and 2008. Martinez and his wife Casey have three children together.\nDuring the baseball offseason, Martinez worked as a substitute teacher, a job that he left after retiring from baseball. He worked as a financial advisor after leaving baseball and declined his acceptance into the Master of Business Administration program at Columbia University in favor of a job at PricewaterhouseCoopers. On February 1, 2022, MLB hired Martinez as their Senior Director of On-Field Operations."

He was discovered by catcher Josh Johnson, who encouraged him to try baseball. Goose Curry scouted him to play in the Negro leagues, starting him off in a Mississippi baseball school. He played for three years with the Memphis Red Sox, then signed a minor league contract, playing in 1952 in the Mississippi–Ohio Valley League for Canton and in 1953 for Mount Vernon. During these years he sustained injuries that prevented him from playing further in the minors. He returned to the Negro leagues in 1955–56 with the Indianapolis Clowns, but did not play for most of 1957 until he was convinced to return and play with the Detroit Stars. In 1958 he was selected as an All-Star for the East-West All Star Game. His last year in the Negro leagues was 1959.\nLate in his life, Henry fought a long battle with Major League Baseball to secure pension benefits that the league promised Negro league players in the 1990s. In the 2000s, Henry began authoring a newspaper column for the St. Louis, Missouri, \"Riverfront Times\" (with the help of his grandson, Sean R. Muhammad) called \"Ask a Negro Leaguer\".

        "title": "Golden age of baseball",
        "text": "The golden age of baseball, or sometimes the golden era, describes the period in Major League Baseball from the end of the dead-ball era until the modern era—roughly, from 1920 to sometime after World War II. \nThe exact years are debated. MLB, for example, considers the golden age to have ended with World War II. Others consider the golden age to have ended in 1951, when the first baseball game was broadcast in color, or in the mid-1960s, when all baseball games were broadcast in color.\nPlayers.\nThe golden age was dominated by stars such as Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Hank Greenberg, Rogers Hornsby and especially Babe Ruth, whose called shot was one of the defining moments of the era. Another defining moment of the golden era was Gabby Hartnett's Homer in the Gloamin'. By 1919, when Ruth hit a then-league record 29 home runs, a spectacular feat at that time, the dead-ball era had officially come to an end, ushering in the Live-ball era.\nWhile the most popular icons of the golden era are hitters, and Ruth is generally thought of as one of the premier sports icons in history, there were also several pitchers who dominated hitters on the mound during that same time, and two of the best of them were Lefty Grove and Dizzy Dean, both of whom won over 30 games in the early 1930s. Further, some of the most popular players in the Negro National League included names such as Oscar Charleston, Josh Gibson, and Mule Suttles. Later in the era, players such as Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, Ernie Banks, and pitchers Bob Gibson and Warren Spahn, among others, established themselves as Hall of Famers and ultimately played into the late 1960s and 1970s, providing a bridge between the golden age and the current era.\nTeams.\nFrom a team perspective, the golden age of baseball (using the years 1918-1964 as a guideline) was dominated by the American League's New York Yankees, who won 29 pennants and 20 World Series titles between 1918 and 1964. In the National League, dominance was shared by the St. Louis Cardinals, Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, each of whom won nine pennants.\nTeams travelled primarily by train during the period, occasionally stopping off at saloons and speakeasies in between games, mingling with fans and adding to the mystique of the era, as this is unlikely to happen often today. Many players also worked other \"primary\" jobs in the offseason, and others stepped away in the middle of their careers to serve in the military.\nEntire franchises were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, at the time, with the Cleveland Indians becoming the first team to be sold for over $1,000,000 when Bob Hope and Bill Veeck bought the club for $1.6 million.\nBaseball during the Great Depression.\nThe Wall Street Crash of 1929 ushered in the Great Depression, affecting baseball, along with many other businesses, organizations, and families. Ticket sales plunged 40%, jeopardizing the popularity and prosperity of the sport. Many players lost their jobs, including Babe Ruth. Player salaries dropped about 20% on average, and did not return for years.\nColor line in the golden age.\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, nearly all black Americans had been shut out from playing any sort of baseball with white Americans, so they formed a separate league. In the early 1900s the Negro National League grew in popularity, despite the fact that white booking agents often had control over when and where the teams would be able to play or practice. The NNL came to an end due to the financial burdens of the Great Depression, but rearose soon after as the Negro American League.\nIn 1947, Jackie Robinson, who had played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the NAL, became the first African American to be integrated into the all-white world of baseball. Brooklyn Dodgers president Branch Rickey tapped Robinson to break the baseball color line. Robinson was still a target of many racist comments and slurs during his time in the majors. Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.\nWomen in baseball.\nThe very first women's baseball game where girls were paid and prospectors paid admission took place in Illinois in 1875. However, many were unimpressed with the women's abilities while playing baseball. During this time, many Americans didn't see women as being athletes or as major participants in sports. In fact, even in the beginning of the 1900s, people opposed women in all sports because they were afraid that sports would ultimately destroy women's femininity. American perspectives on women at this time were that they were meant to be viewed as perfect and feminine, and many thought that for a woman to participate in such physical activities and sports would make them become more masculine.\nWomen's baseball began to be taken more seriously at the start of World War II. Philip K. Wrigley, the owner of the Chicago Cubs, decided to invest in an all women's baseball league that went by the AAGPBL (All-American Girls Professional Baseball League) in 1943. Wrigley was worried about losing a good number of male ball players due to the war, he believed that creating a women's league would keep the flow of money coming in from the ball parks. Despite the changing views of Americans towards what women should and should not be able to do in sports, they were still held to a higher caliber of femininity and perfection at this time. Women that played the sport were required to take classes on how to be feminine after practices and games, and were often looked down upon for demonstrating any masculine traits. Nonetheless, this league still opened up opportunities for future women in sports."

        "text": "William Carl Wilkinson (born August 10, 1964) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. A left-handed pitcher, Wilkinson played for Major League Baseball's (MLB) Seattle Mariners in 1985, and from 1987 to 1988. During his career, he had a 5–8 record, 4.56 earned run average (ERA) and 103 strikeouts in 113⅓ innings pitched.\nCareer.\nIn the 1983 MLB draft, Wilkinson was selected in the fourth round by the Mariners, with the 87th overall pick. On June 13, 1985, he made his MLB debut with the Mariners, and took the loss against the Kansas City Royals after allowing four earned runs in five and two-thirds innings. Five days later, Wilkinson lost in his only other appearance during the 1985 season, which was also a start; he allowed five earned runs and recorded only one out. In his two MLB starts, Wilkinson was 0–2 with a 13.50 earned run average. He was the fifth-youngest player in the American League in 1985. Following his start against the Rangers, the Mariners demoted him to the minor leagues.\nWilkinson did not pitch in MLB in 1986; he instead played for the Mariners' Triple-A affiliate, the Calgary Cannons of the Pacific Coast League. In 1985 and 1986, Wilkinson had a combined record of 13–9 while pitching for the Cannons. He appeared in 56 games as a reliever for Seattle in 1987, the most of any Mariners pitcher that year. He compiled a 3–4 record, with a 3.66 earned run average (ERA) and 10 saves. The following season, Wilkinson pitched in 30 games, and posted a 2–2 record with two saves and a career-low 3.48 ERA. However, he suffered an injury to his left shoulder. Before the 1989 season began, Wilkinson was sent back down to the minor leagues, where he was used as a starter. In April, the Mariners traded Wilkinson to the Pittsburgh Pirates as part of a five-player deal. Wilkinson never pitched for the Pirates, and did not return to MLB after 1988. His final minor league season was 1992, when he pitched for two teams in the Oakland Athletics organization, posting an 0–3 record and 8.21 ERA in 23 games.\nFamily.\nBorn in Greybull, Wyoming, Wilkinson is the great-grandson of Jim Bluejacket, a right-handed pitcher who spent three seasons in the Federal League and National League from 1914 to 1916. Bluejacket and Wilkinson were the first great-grandfather and great-grandson duo that have both played in MLB. Wilkinson's brother, Brian, was selected in the 1987 Major League Baseball draft by the Mariners."

During the summer of 1975, there was speculation that the Minnesota Twins, Chicago White Sox, or San Francisco Giants could move to Seattle. When none of these plans proved successful, the American League added a team in Seattle. With thirteen teams in a league creating a scheduling nightmare, the league awarded a franchise to Toronto over Washington, D.C. in March 1976.\nPlayers were selected only from American League teams, in keeping with the practices of the A.L.'s expansion of 1961, the National League's expansion of 1962, and the expansion of both leagues in 1969. Beginning with the next expansion in 1993, the new teams would select players from teams in both the American and National Leagues.\nDanny Kaye, part-owner of the Mariners, announced the club's first selection."

The 2016 USDGC champion, Jeremy \"Big Jerm\" Koling, was leading the tournament after the third round. He was declared the winner when the fourth round was canceled due to inclement weather produced by Hurricane Matthew.\nThe 2011 USDGC was played in a different format to the previous twelve events. Each player was assigned a projected score on each hole based on their PDGA Player Rating. The player's official score was how they played in comparison to their projected score. For example, if a player had a projected score of 90 and they finished their round at 81, their official tournament score was a -9. The player with the best official tournament score across all four rounds was John Key who scored -16. Because of the change to the format, Key is often omitted from the list of USDGC Champions. "

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for Yorkshire, and at club level for Askam RUFC (now Askam ARLFC), Barnsley RUFC, and , and representative level rugby league (RL) for Yorkshire, and at club level for Wakefield Trinity (Heritage № 62) (captain), as a , i.e. number 1.\nPlaying career.\nCounty Honours.\nJimmy Metcalfe was selected for Yorkshire (RU) whilst at during the 1896-7 season, and was selected for Yorkshire County XIII (RL) whilst at Wakefield Trinity during the 1897–98 season and 1898–99 season.\nChallenge Cup Final appearances.\nJimmy Metcalfe played , and scored the conversion in Wakefield Trinity's 17-0 victory over Hull F.C. in the 1909 Challenge Cup Final during the 1908–09 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Tuesday 20 April 1909, in front of a crowd of 23,587.\nCounty Cup Final appearances.\nJimmy Metcalfe played , and scored a goal in Wakefield Trinity's 8-2 victory over Huddersfield in the 1910 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1910–11 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 3 December 1910.\nNotable tour matches.\nJimmy Metcalfe played , and scored the goal in Wakefield Trinity's 5-5 draw with the New Zealand in the 1907–1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain match at Belle Vue, Wakefield on Wednesday 23 October 1907, and played , and scored four goals in the 20-13 victory over Australia in the 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain match at Belle Vue, Wakefield on Saturday 19 December 1908.\nClub career.\nJimmy Metcalfe made his début for Wakefield Trinity during September 1897, he played his last match for Wakefield Trinity during the 1910–11 season, he appears to have scored no drop-goals (or field-goals as they are currently known in Australasia), but prior to the 1974–75 season all goals, whether; conversions, penalties, or drop-goals, scored 2-points, consequently prior to this date drop-goals were often not explicitly documented, therefore '0' drop-goals may indicate drop-goals not recorded, rather than no drop-goals scored. In addition, prior to the 1949–50 season, the archaic field-goal was also still a valid means of scoring points.\nContemporaneous Article Extract.\n\"James Metcalfe - Of the many fine players who figured in Trinity's ranks in the early N.U. days was one who gave outstanding service to the club and in whom the players could always have supreme confidence on the last line of defence. Jimmy Metcalfe soon won recognition as one of the finest full-backs in the country. Born in Cumberland, Jimmy's early football was with Askham-in-Furness (sic Askam-in-Furness), with whom he started in 1890 under R.U. rules. His first club in Yorkshire was Barnsley R.U. and thence to Featherstone. Whilst there, in season 1896-7, he played twice for North v. South - these being R.U. trial matches - and in that season too he figured in all Yorkshire's R.U. county games. It was later - but still in 1897 - that he turned to the Northern Union code and joined Trinity. Here his distinctions were continued and he was a member of the Yorkshire N.U. side which won the County Championship of 1897-8 and again in 1898-9. We can hardly do justice to his fine career in what must necessarily be a short account, but mention must be made of the fact that he played in Trinity's successful Cup Final at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds in 1909, when he was thirty-six years old. And that was not the end. He did not cease to play until 1911 and, in his last match for Trinity gave a final display of his goal-kicking ability by adding three to his wonderful record. Jimmy's record of kicking eleven goals in a match has been equalled twice, but never extended. He set up the record on April 6, 1909, against Bramley at Belle Vue. Trinity's score was 11-15-67 to 2-2-10.\" \nGenealogical Information.\nJames Metcalfe was the father of the rugby league who played in the 1920s and 1930s for Wakefield Trinity (Heritage № 347); James Metcalfe Junior, and was the paternal grandfather of the rugby league footballer; Donald \"Don\" Metcalfe.\nNote.\n'Dreadnoughts - A HISTORY OF Wakefield Trinity F. C. 1873 - 1960' states that James Metcalfe was \"Born in Cumberland, Jimmy's early football was with Askham-in-Furness\". Askam-in-Furness is on the Furness peninsula, which was part of Lancashire until the 1974 English county boundary reorganisation, when it became part of Cumbria, England. This would mean that James Metcalfe wasn't born in Askam-in-Furness, or it was mistakenly believed that Askam-in-Furness was in Cumberland, England."

Since 2015 it has been a designated ECB Premier League, the highest level of recreational club cricket in England and Wales.\nHistory.\nLeague cricket in Hertfordshire began in 1968 with the forming of the Hertfordshire Cricket Competition. In 1974 the leading clubs broke away from the Competition and formed the Hertfordshire Cricket League, and then in 1994 the two tournaments once again merged under the name Hertfordshire Cricket League.\nWhen the system of ECB Premier Leagues was introduced, it was decided that the Hertfordshire Cricket League together with the Cherwell Cricket League and Thames Valley Cricket League should become feeders to a newly formed Home Counties Premier Cricket League. Accordingly, between 2000 and 2013 the top Hertfordshire clubs played in that league and not in the Hertfordshire Cricket League.\nHertfordshire's relationship with the Home Counties Premier Cricket League was always uneasy, and in autumn 2013 the Hertfordshire clubs all resigned from the Home Counties Premier Cricket League (with the exception of Tring Park, who had not played in the Hertfordshire Cricket League since 1981, when they switched to the Thames Valley Cricket League). The Hertfordshire clubs then returned to the Hertfordshire Cricket League, which was awarded ECB Premier League status in time for the 2015 season. \nUntil 2022, the league used a format where the championship was not decided on league performance alone; the top four in the league table then played semi finals and a final to decide the champions. This format was discontinued for the 2023 season.\nAlthough most of the league's member clubs are located within the borders of the county, teams from North London and Bedfordshire are also members, and in the past there have been member clubs from Buckinghamshire and Essex as well.

It was the first edition of the event held in Abu Dhabi, from January 1 through January 3, 2009 and. Six of the world's top ten were competing in the knockout event, which had prize money of $250,000 to the winner. The event was held at the Abu Dhabi International Tennis Complex at the Zayed Sports City in Abu Dhabi. It served as a warm-up event for the season, with the ATP World Tour beginning on January 5, 2009.\nRafael Nadal (world number 1) and Roger Federer (number 2) received byes to the semi-final.\nReview.\nDay one.\nAndy Roddick and Nikolay Davydenko started the tournament on January 1. Davydenko won the match in straight sets 6–4, 6–4. Roddick won his first service game with three straight aces but was broken in his next service game and Davydenko held his serves to take the set. At 4–4 in the second he was again broken and Davydenko then held his serve to win the match and set up a match with Nadal.\nLater in the day Andy Murray beat James Blake 6–2, 6–2 in a match lasting less than one hour. Murray broke Blake twice in each set to win the match. He broke Blake for the first time in the third game and then established a 5–2 lead with another break. He then took a 4–0 lead in the second set. Murray went through to face former world no. 1 Roger Federer in the semi-finals.\nDay two.\nDay Two began with the first semi-final between Federer and Murray. Federer broke Murray early on to open up a 3–0 lead but Murray broke back to level the match at 3-3. With a tiebreak looming Federer broke for the set. Murray took the second 6–2 to level the match. In the final set, Murray continued his winning run of games, taking a 4–1 lead but, after missing an opportunity for 5–1, Federer won the next three games. The set went to a tiebreak which Murray edged 8–6 to reach the final and to beat Federer for the fifth time.\nIn the second semi-final Davydenko faced Nadal. The Russian broke Nadal to love in the first game of the match but he won just one more game in the set as he lost it 6–2. The second set began just as the first, with a break for Davydenko but Nadal immediately broke back. In the sixth game, with Davydenko serving at 3-2 down, Nadal gained another break and which the Russian could not recover, with the Spaniard taking the set 6-3 for a 6–2, 6–3 victory. Nadal went through to the final to play Murray.\nDay three.\nThe final saw Nadal take on Murray. The first two games went with serve. But Murray broke Nadal in his next service game, after a third break point. Nadal, however, broke back in the eighth game. Murray then won the next two games to take the set 6–4. The second set started with four straight service holds before Murray got a break to lead 3–2. With victory in sight for Murray, Nadal broke straight back. He then got another break in the 12th game and closed out the set 7–5. In the seventh game of the final set Murray gained the decisive break in a game lasting 14 minutes.

        "text": "CART World Series is a racing video game for the PlayStation console, developed by Sony Interactive Studios America and published by Sony Computer Entertainment and released in October 1997. \"CART World Series\" is based on the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) open-wheel racing series.\nGameplay.\nThis game is licensed and features many notable drivers from the late 1990s, such as Greg Moore, Al Unser Jr. and Paul Tracy. The game also features realistic handling and damage. Players can compete in a full year's worth of races competing for points in each race or in simple single races. There are two game modes: arcade and simulation. Arcade mode allows re-spawning of damaged vehicle parts. In Simulation mode, all damage is permanent for the race. The game supports the analog controller.\nThe player can make many modifications to a car's performance. The player can adjust the tires to fit the road (hard for ovals or soft for road courses), as well as modify gear ratios and aerodynamics. Moving the front of the car down or slanting the wings may enable the player to find a perfect combination of speed and handling. During simulation mode races, the car's tires will wear down and fuel will deplete (both can be replaced by a pit stop).\nIn addition to the real drivers and cars (Honda and Ford included), ten official CART tracks have been included, each modeled after its real-life counterpart. Tracks span the United States and are located in Cleveland, Michigan, Long Beach and more. Each features realistic dynamics and road handling in an attempt to create a believable racing experience. In Season Mode, the player takes part in a series of races, for which the player must qualify and race, earning points toward a cup.\nThis game also features a two-player mode via either split screen or PlayStation Link Cable, or a combination of both for four players.\nReception.\nThe game received primarily mixed reviews. Critics widely praised the graphics of both the car models and the detailed tracks, as well as the extensive CART licensed content. However, some criticized the music and reaction to the controls was divided. Sushi-X of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" found them not responsive enough, and Jaz Rignall commented in \"IGN\" that the way the car sticks firmly to the road, preventing the powerslides that racing game fans are accustomed to, is frustrating. Contrarily, \"GamePro\" stated that \"the effective car setup options and responsive handling keep you on the track.\"\nSushi-X's co-reviewers Kraig Kujawa and John Ricciardi both recommended \"CART World Series\", with Kujawa remarking that it \"strikes a careful balance between realism and fun\". However, most critics, including the other two members of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s review team, concluded that while it was a decent game on its own terms, it did not hold up well against other games in the crowded PlayStation racing game market of the time. \"GamePro\", for example, opined that \"For sport racing fans, CART ranks third this season - \"NASCAR '98\" has better balance, while \"F1 Championship Edition\" has deeper sim play.\""

        "title": "1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft",
        "text": "The 1960 MLB expansion draft was held by Major League Baseball on December 14, 1960, to fill the rosters of the Los Angeles Angels and the Washington Senators. The Angels and Senators (who later became the Texas Rangers) were new franchises that would enter the American League (AL) the following season as part of the 1961 Major League Baseball expansion. The Angels represented the AL's first team to be based on the West Coast of the United States, while the Senators would take the place of the league's original Washington Senators franchise that had moved to Minneapolis–Saint Paul as the Minnesota Twins after the season.\nThe draft, held in Boston, site of American League headquarters, had been scheduled for Tuesday, December 13, 1960, but had to be postponed one day due to a heavy snowstorm that struck the New England region. \nGround rules.\nAs with all MLB expansion lotteries prior to 1992, it was an \"intraleague\" affair and only players from the admitting league were eligible for selection. Each existing American League club had to make available for the draft seven players on their active rosters on August 31, 1960, and eight others from their 40-man rosters. The expansion clubs paid US$75,000 for each of 28 players they drafted with a maximum of seven players drafted from each existing club, not including minor league selections. They were required to take at least ten pitchers, two catchers, six infielders, and four outfielders. The clubs also had the option of drafting one non-roster player for $25,000 from each established franchise.\nHasty expansion sowed draft confusion.\nReacting belatedly to the National League's July 1960 announcement that it would expand to New York and Houston to begin play in April 1962 (twenty months later), the American League suddenly declared in October 1960 it would add two new teams as well—and that the AL's expansion teams would take the field in only six months, in time for the 1961 season.\nPlaying catch-up to the National League, under a much tighter deadline with no ownership groups, management or stadia yet in place, the Junior Circuit was forced to wait until November 17, 1960, to officially award an expansion franchise to Washington, D.C., to replace the recently-relocated Twins. Because it also intended to enter the Los Angeles metropolitan market, then controlled by Walter O'Malley, principal owner of the Dodgers, the American League was compelled to negotiate an indemnification agreement with O'Malley before the Los Angeles franchise could be granted. Finally, on December 6, 1960—one week before the expansion draft was expected to be held—the Angels franchise was officially created and awarded to Gene Autry. \nBecause each new team had not had the time to assemble a scouting department, they were forced to lean on scouting reports from National League franchises to select their full complement of new players. The Angels were aided by the San Francisco Giants, and the Senators by the Pittsburgh Pirates. The league's chaotic, eleventh-hour approach to expansion resulted, on the day of the draft, in the new Senators' and Angels' noncompliance with rules that governed the maximum number of players each new club could select from each of the eight established teams. As a result, several post-draft trades were necessary to rectify the problem.\nThe situation is described by authors Andy McCue and Eric Thompson in their 2011 \"Hardball Times\" article, \"Mismanagement 101: The American League Expansion of 1961,\" also published by the Society for American Baseball Research."

It was the club's fifth German title and its first in 83 years, having last won it in 1925. It was a rematch of the 2006-07 final, also played in Frankfurt am Main, which SC 1880 had lost to Heidelberg 15-23. Alongside the national championship final, the 2nd Bundesliga final was played as a curtain raiser for the game.\nLast placed RK Heusenstamm would have been relegated but the league was expanded to nine teams for 2008-09 and no team had to drop down to the 2nd Bundesliga. This was decided on 19 July 2008 at the annual meeting of the German rugby association. The decision was made to expand the league to ten teams for the 2009-10 season.\nNominally, the eight placed team in the league would be relegated while the seventh placed team had to play the loser of the 2nd Bundesliga final for one more league place. The 2nd Bundesliga champion is directly promoted, which was the RK 03 Berlin in 2008.\nThe 2007-08 final was sponsored by the French bank Société Générale. It was not broadcast live on television but the Deutsches Sportfernsehen showed one hour of highlights the following Monday."

It was CCC's best performance thus far in the competition. They progressed to the final by posting victories against Barbados, the Leeward Islands, the Windward Islands and Guyana. However, CCC were no match for a strong Jamaica team, who won easily.

        "text": "The Scottish National League was first played for in 1997 under the name The Scottish Conference before changing to its current name the following season and is the top tier domestic rugby league club competition in Scotland. It was renamed the RLC Scottish Premier between 2007 and 2011 and formed a division of the Rugby League Conference competition.\nHistory.\nThe first domestic Scottish club were the Forth &amp; Clyde Nomads who played in the 95/96 North-East League but folded shortly before the announcement about a new Scottish rugby league competition. They made history when they won the first ever domestic competition, the \"Scottish Challenge Cup\" in 1996 beating Stirling University 30–24.\nThe first title was won by Lomond Valley Raiders who beat Central Centurions in the final of the first domestic competition. The following three seasons saw different champions each season, Border Raiders in their debut season in 1998, Edinburgh Eagles in 1999 against fellow Edinburgh side Portobello Playboys and Glasgow Bulls in 2000, before in 2001 the \"Eagles\" lifted the first of a hat-trick of title wins. In 2002 the league ran two 4 team divisions but reverted to one division the following season. The \"Eagles\" dominance was ended by Fife Lions in the 2004 Grand Final. The following season saw one season wonders \"Royal Scots Steelers\" from Edinburgh beat \"Fife Lions\" in the final. The \"Lions\" regained the title in 2006 before the \"Edinburgh Eagles\" returned for a second hat-trick run of title successes including the first two against \"Fife Lions\". In 2010 a new name was carved onto the trophy when Carluke Tigers gained revenge for their previous seasons final defeat in extra-time against \"Edinburgh Eagles\" by defeating the all-conquering team 14–10. The \"Eagles\" lifted the next two titles against finals debutants Ayrshire Storm in 2011 and Aberdeen Warriors in 2012. In that 2011 season the league once again ran two divisions this time on a regional basis \"Central\" and \"North\". This lasted until 2014. Aberdeen Warriors won four straight titles 2013–16. 2017 saw Strathmore Silverbacks lift their 1st title pipping the Edinburgh Eagles to the title. 2018 saw the \"Eagles\" return to the top of the pack after 6 years overturning the 2017 Champions Strathmore Silverbacks on points difference. 2019 saw Strathmore collect their second title pipping Glasgow RL to the title. \"Edinburgh Eagles\" picked up the league and cup double in 2021.\nMany of the teams also run junior teams in the National Youth League.\n1997 season.\nThe inaugural Scottish Conference kicked off on 27 July when Linlithgow Lions lost at home against Lomond Valley Raiders 50–68. Five teams contested that debut season, eventual champions Lomond Valley Raiders, runners-up Central Centurions, Linlithgow Lions, Inverness RL and Glasgow based Whitecraigs Warriors. The \"Raiders\" went through the season unbeaten.\n1998 season.\nFive teams once again contested the newly retitled Scottish National League new clubs Edinburgh Eagles, Border Raiders and Glasgow Bulls replaced \"Central Centurions\", \"Inverness RL\" and \"Whitecraigs Warriors\". The Border Raiders who had former Great Britain international Hugh Waddell in their ranks lifted the title when they beat Edinburgh Eagles in the inaugural Grand Final at Hillhead Sports Club in Glasgow 40–14. As champions the \"Raiders\" were entered into the Challenge Cup and on 6 December 1998 history was made when they took to the field against Wath Brow Hornets at \"Hillhead Sports Club\" losing by only 10–34.\n1999 season.\nThe league increased to six clubs with Edinburgh based Portobello Playboys joining the league. The Grand Final was once again played at \"Hillhead Sports Club\" in Glasgow and was contested by the two Edinburgh clubs following their play-off victories against \"Border Raiders\" and \"Linlithgow Lions\". In the final table toppers and favourites Edinburgh Eagles beat Portobello Playboys 48–20. As champions the \"Eagles\" progressed into the Challenge Cup and a round 1 home meeting with top amateur side Woolston Rovers. After being 0-16 down at half-time the club nearly pulled off an almighty shock before going down 12–17.\n2000 season.\nThe same six teams competed, one though, Lomond Valley Raiders changed their name to Rhu Raiders. Off the field Scotland Rugby League were officially recognised by SportScotland in October 1999 and on the field it seemed a certainty that Edinburgh Eagles would retain their title having gone through the season losing just one game to reach the Grand Final. Their opponents were Glasgow Bulls who having finished in 4th place with 5 wins and 5 defeats had reached the final following play-off wins over Rhu Raiders and league runners-up Border Raiders. In the final the \"Bulls\" pulled off a massive upset in winning 47–22 at Royal High Corstorphine RFC in Edinburgh. In the Challenge Cup the \"Glasgow Bulls\" lost heavily to Wigan Rose Bridge 0-72.\n2001 season.\nThe same six clubs competed again in a season disrupted by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth. Once again Edinburgh Eagles and Glasgow Bulls contested the Grand Final having gone through the season losing just one game, against each other. In the final played at West of Scotland FC in Glasgow the \"Eagles\" came out on top 30–16, at one point they led 30–0. In the Challenge Cup the \"Eagles\" lost at home to Leigh East 10–68.\n2002 season.\nThe league expanded to two divisions of four. Division 1 consisted of reigning champions Edinburgh Eagles, runners-up Glasgow Bulls, Portobello Playboys and Dumbarton Dragons who were previously known as \"Rhu Raiders\" but had relocated to Loch Lomond. In Division 2 were Border Raiders, Fife Lions who were previously called \"Linlithgow Lions\" but moved to Fife and two new clubs south Glasgow based Lanarkshire Storm and Clyde Buccaneers. Portobello won Division 1 remaining unbeaten and defeated 3rd placed \"Glasgow Bulls\" in the play-offs, in the other play-off \"Edinburgh Eagles\" saw off Division 2 winners \"Fife Lions\" 58–6. In the Grand Final played at \"Cavalry Park\" in Edinburgh Edinburgh Eagles beat the Portobello Playboys 46–24. In the Challenge Cup \"Edinburgh Eagles\" lost at home to Oulton Raiders in the first round 8-26. \nLadder.\nDivision 2.\nSource: Results\n2003 season.\nThe league reverted to one division and also lost two clubs. \"Lanarkshire Storm\" resigned after just one season and \"Dumbarton Dragons\" who as \"Lomond Valley Raiders\" won the first title, also failed to start the season. Reigning champions Edinburgh Eagles went through the season unbeaten and dispatched first time finalists Fife Lions in the final. In the \"Challenge Cup\" first round \"Edinburgh Eagles\" lost out to Heworth ARLFC 8-34.\n2004 season.\nThe 2004 season only had four clubs, Border Raiders who were champions in their debut season in 1998 called it a day after failing to find a suitable ground to use and Glasgow Bulls decided to take a seasons break to reorganise the club following their benefactor Bradford Bulls getting into financial difficulty. The season itself was exciting as all four clubs had a chance of reaching the Grand Final going into the final games. In the end we had a repeat of the previous years final but this time a different and new winner. Fife Lions beat Edinburgh Eagles in the final 36–24 to lift their first title. As champions they represented Scotland in the \"Challenge Cup\" but were beaten at South London Sharks 10–42.\n2005 season.\nIt was all change for this season as two clubs left the competition \"Portobello Playboys\" and \"Clyde Buccaneers\" one returned after a years absence \"Glasgow Bulls\" and three made their debut Royal Scots Steelers from Edinburgh, Moray Eels based at \"RAF Lossiemouth\" and east Glasgow based Easterhouse Panthers. Fife Lions finished top of the table winning all their matches to reach the Grand Final while new boys \"Royal Scots Steelers\" caused a surprise and also reached the final after beating fellow Edinburgh side \"Edinburgh Eagles\" in the play-offs. In the final the \"Steelers\" shocked the \"Lions\" 56–46 to win in their debut season. The Royal Scots Steelers did not enter the Challenge Cup.\n2006 season.\n2006 saw the loss of defending champions \"Royal Scots Steelers\" after just one campaign their place being taken up by Paisley Hurricanes. Fife Lions for the 3rd year running finished top of the table and went on to claim their second championship. After getting past Glasgow Bulls in the semi-final they met and beat Moray Eels who'd surprisingly beaten Edinburgh Eagles in the other semi-final. In the Challenge Cup \"Fife\" were beaten at Normanton Knights 8–46 in the first round.\n2007 season.\nThe 2007 season brought stability to the league as the same clubs once again competed. The season also brought a name change to the Co-operative Scottish Rugby League Conference as the league formed part of the national Rugby League Conference. Fife Lions for the 4th season in a row finished top losing just one game, which was against their perennial contenders, Edinburgh Eagles. Not surprisingly the two clubs won their play-off semi-finals against Moray Eels and Paisley Hurricanes and in the final \"Edinburgh Eagles\" won to lift their 5th title. In the \"Challenge Cup\" the \"Eagles\" lost out to Normanton Knights in Yorkshire 8-38.\n2008 season.\nThe league lost one club but gained two as 7 clubs competed. \"Glasgow Bulls\" having lost all their games the previous season folded and were replaced in the west end of Glasgow by Jordanhill Phoenix and Carluke Tigers from \"Lanarkshire\" were the other new club. Edinburgh Eagles retained their title after thrashing Fife Lions in the final 54–4 at the Royal High Corstorphine RFC in Edinburgh. Debutants \"Carluke Tigers\" finished second in the league losing out to \"Fife Lions\" in the semi-final, in the other semi-final \"Edinburgh Eagles\" saw off Paisley Hurricanes. In the \"Challenge Cup\" the \"Eagles\" made history when they became the first Scottish side to win a game beating the RAF in the first round 18–16, in the second round they lost narrowly at Leeds Met 6-20.\n2009 season.\nLike the previous season the league lost one club and gained two as the competition reached eight clubs. \"Paisley Hurricanes\" surprisingly called it a day despite having reached the play-offs the previous two seasons. Coming in were Hillfoots Rams who would be based at \"Hillfoots RFC\" in Clackmannanshire and Victoria Knights from south Glasgow and playing out of Nethercraigs, a club that was already running several successful youth sides. On the field Edinburgh Eagles once again dominated remaining unbeaten all season and lifting the title after beating Carluke Tigers in the final albeit after extra time 18–10 at GHA RFC in Glasgow. In the \"Challenge Cup\" the \"Eagles\" once again won in the first round beating Gloucestershire Warriors away 36–32. In the second round they were beaten by Welsh club Blackwood Bulldogs 16–28 at Meggetland Sports Complex in Edinburgh.\n2010 season.\nThere were changes again before the season commenced with eight clubs. Three teams departed \"Hillfoots Rams\" after one season, and two Glasgow clubs \"Jordanhill Phoenix\" and \"Victoria Knights\" who returned to being a youth set-up. Joining the ranks were the first ever Scottish rugby league club Forth &amp; Clyde Nomads who had been formed in 1995 and had competed in the \"North-East League\" in England. The other two clubs were newly formed, Ayrshire Storm based at Irvine and Falkirk Romans. Reigning champions Edinburgh Eagles finished top of the table closely followed by the previous seasons runners-up Carluke Tigers. In the play-offs \"Carluke\" shocked the \"Eagles\" by winning in Edinburgh 24–16 to reach the Grand Final. \"Edinburgh\" got past Moray Eels who had put out \"Ayrshire Storm\" to eventually reach the Final. In the final played at GHA RFC in Glasgow \"Carluke\" repeated their play-off victory to lift their first title 14–10. In the \"Challenge Cup\" the \"Tigers\" lost away at Woolston Rovers 18–44.\n2011 season.\nThe league structure was changed with the re-introduction of two divisions effectively north and south, but actually called 1 and 2. Two clubs left \"Falkirk Romans\" and \"Forth &amp; Clyde Nomads\" both after competing in one season. Newcomers who all joined Division 2 were Aberdeen Warriors, Ross Sutherland RL and Elgin based Moray Titans. In Division 1 Edinburgh Eagles led the way winning all their games followed by Ayrshire Storm behind these two, who would contest the Grand Final, were Carluke Tigers, Fife Lions and Easterhouse Panthers. Division 2 was won by \"Aberdeen Warriors\" who like \"Edinburgh\" won all their games behind them came \"Moray Tians\", Moray Eels and finally \"Ross Sutherland RL\". In the Division 1 Grand Final \"Edinburgh\" saw off debutant finalists \"Ayrshire\" 26–10 at GHA RFC in Glasgow. In the \"Challenge Cup\" \"Edinburgh\" were heavily defeated at Stanley Rangers 12–60.\n2012 season.\nThe Scottish rugby league left the English Rugby League Conference umbrella and under a brand new title Scottish Conference set about on an independent course. Two leagues remained this time renamed the Central Conference and the Northern Conference. Unfortunately the champions of 2010 \"Carluke Tigers\" failed to make the start replacing them were East Lothian Hawks from Haddington. The competition also saw both Edinburgh Eagles and Aberdeen Warriors run 'A' teams. In the Central Conference \"Edinburgh Eagles\" finished top ahead of Ayrshire Storm who they then beat in the play-off 52–18. In the Northern Conference \"Aberdeen Warriors\" came top ahead of \"Edinburgh Eagles\" 'A' who they beat 80–4 in their play-off. In the Grand Final played at Falkirk RFC \"Edinburgh\" won their 9th title winning 36–10.\n2013 season.\nFor the 2nd year, Scottish Conference \"East Lothian Hawks\" and the two 'A' teams of \"Edinburgh\" and \"Aberdeen\" did not compete while Victoria Knights returned as a senior side for the second time following their campaign in 2009. In the Central Conference Easterhouse Panthers surprisingly finished top ahead of Edinburgh Eagles with Ayrshire Storm, Fife Lions and newboys \"Victoria Knights\" following. In the Northern Conference Aberdeen Warriors dominated finishing top and unbeaten, followed by Moray Titans, Moray Eels and finally Ross Sutherland RL. The play-off semi-finals brought victories for the two league leaders \"Easterhouse Panthers\" against \"Moray Titans\" and \"Aberdeen Warriors\" 22–20 against \"Edinburgh Eagles\". In the Grand Final at Falkirk RFC the Aberdeen Warriors won their first title 30–28 against the Easterhouse Panthers.\n2014 season.\nThe Scottish rugby league secured its first sponsor when Deuchars IPA agreed a four-year deal. The competition named Deuchars IPA National League suffered from a plethora of clubs leaving, which was partly due to the RFL withdrawing all their funding to the Scottish Rugby League. Two-time former champions \"Fife Lions\" were the biggest name to go; after appearing in the previous 17 campaigns they decided to call it a day after a couple of seasons of struggle both on and off the pitch. \"Victoria Knights\" lasted just one season for the second time, deciding to fully concentrate on their youth clubs. Also leaving were three clubs from the north: \"Ross Sutherland RL\", \"Moray Eels\" and \"Moray Titans\". The season itself saw Aberdeen Warriors lay down a marker for their continued dominance as they went through the season undefeated, leading them to their second title after beating Edinburgh Eagles 30–20 in the final played in Aberdeen at the Hazlehead Academy. In the \"Challenge Cup\" champions Aberdeen Warriors made their debut but were heavily beaten at Pilkington Recs 4-46.\n2015 season.\nFour clubs once again competed but \"Ayrshire Storm\" left to be replaced by Forfar based Strathmore Silverbacks. The season saw a combination of home and away games and nines tournaments, hosted by all the clubs, to decide the two finalists. By the end of the season Aberdeen Warriors had qualified for the Grand Final along with debutants \"Strathmore Silverbacks\" but were then proclaimed champions after no final was played. In the Challenge Cup the \"Warriors\" lost narrowly at top side Skirlaugh Bulls 20–27.\n2016 season.\nThe same four clubs competed for the title with reigning champions Aberdeen Warriors and Strathmore Silverbacks finishing as the top two and therefore reaching the Grand Final. In the final underdogs \"Strathmore\" gave a good account of themselves before going down to a 48–32 defeat to the \"Warriors\" who registered their fourth straight title success at Montrose RFC. In the Challenge Cup \"Aberdeen\" lost at Northumbria University 16–42.\n2017 season.\nStrathmore 30-54 Aberdeen\nStrathmore 42-28 Edinburgh\nEdinburgh 36-34 Aberdeen\nFinal.\nSource: \n2018 season.\nEdinburgh 42-34 Strathmore\nFinal.\nSource: \n2019 season.\nLadder.\nNote: (C) = Champions\n2020 season.\nThe 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2021 season.\nLadder.\nNote: (C) = Champions\nSource: \n2023 season.\nOn 22 May Aberdeen Warriors withdrew from the league over governance concerns by Scotland Rugby League."

        "title": "Morris County Golf Club",
        "text": "The Morris County Golf Club (MCGC) is a private, members-only golf club located on in the upscale Convent Station section of Morris Township, New Jersey, a suburb northwest of New York City in Morris County. It is one of the 10 founding member clubs of the New Jersey State Golf Association.\nFounded in 1894, it was unique at the time in that it was established and operated by women only. The following year, MCGC became an early member of the United States Golf Association and was the first New Jersey venue to host a national championship. Two of the club's presidents have also served as United States Golf Association presidents.\nHistory.\nOn April 10, 1894, a group of women met in Morristown to plan their new enterprise of a golf course. The group which formed was headed by Miss Nina Howland, as president with others officers including Mrs. H. McK. Twombly and Mrs. William Shippen, Miss Fields and Mrs. Charles Bradley. The group rented 20 acres of land and their first course was laid out with only 7 holes.\nAs of November 1894 the club was the only one in the nation both managed and organized solely by women. The membership of the club was divided into four classes - regular, limited, associate and honorary. Within the first year, the club had 200 female and 175 male members.\nOn June 21, 1895, in a letter to the club's president Nina Howland, the United States Golf Association (USGA) informed Morris County Golf Club that their membership had been granted. This was the first women-only club to become a USGA member.\nIn 1896, changes came as the club was incorporated with a $50,000 capital stock and almost 100 acres were purchased with plans of course expansion. In 1897, the course's management was taken over by men.\nAlthough golf has always been the club's premier sport, over the years it has been complemented by various other activities. Most notably tennis, swimming, paddle tennis, and ice hockey among others.\nIn 1919, the club's Clubhouse was built. The clubhouse is available to members in addition to sponsored guests for all special events.\nIn 1995, the Preschool Advantage, Inc., began hosting their annual golf invitational at Morris County Golf Club and this year is their 25th year.\nCourse Information.\nIn 1916, the current course was designed by prominent architect Seth Raynor (possibly in partnership with Charles Blair MacDonald) in 1916.

        "text": "The 1969 Wales rugby union tour was a series of rugby union games undertaken by the Wales national rugby union team to Australia, Fiji and New Zealand. The tour took in four matches against regional and invitational teams and three tests; two to New Zealand and one to Australia. This was the second official Wales tour to the southern hemisphere and the first to Australasia and Melanesia.\nThe tour results were mixed for Wales; the team was unbeaten in the non-test matches and were victorious over Australia, but were completely out-classed by New Zealand. The captaincy of the tour was given to Newport's Brian Price."

        "text": "A tennis backboard is a simple wall usually made from some kind of fiberboard and located at a tennis court. It should have a tennis net either drawn or painted at the proper height of 3 ft 6 in. It is designed to allow a single person to practice by hitting a tennis ball against the wall so the ball is returned, much like a second player would return it. Its invention is credited to tennis player Mary Browne in 1926 during her tenure as a coach at the University of Chicago. The main advantage of the backboard is that it provides a realistic and challenging emulation of regulation tennis, while also being more enjoyable. In 1938 a restraining line was added so that players would not stand unrealistically close to the wall.\nMany players are said to have been given their first basic strokes by playing for hours at public courts backboards. Though the backboard's death has been touted more than once, many still believe that it is an important tool to basic skill and stroke development.\nIncluding Roger Federer himself, with a \"Backboard Challenge\".\nSee also.\nTennis court\nExternal links.\nOriginal Patent: \nMost Recent: "
