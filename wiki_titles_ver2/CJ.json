        "title": "Ray Fisher (baseball)",
        "text": "Ray Lyle Fisher (October 4, 1887 – November 3, 1982) was an American professional baseball pitcher and college coach. He pitched all or part of ten seasons in Major League Baseball. His debut game took place on July 2, 1910. His final game took place on October 2, 1920. During his early professional career he played for the New York Yankees and Cincinnati Reds. \nFrom 1921 to 1958, he coached the University of Michigan Wolverines baseball team, and served as assistant coach for basketball and football. In 1929 and 1932 he took the baseball team to Japan for a month each time at the invitation of Meiji University, where they played several games against Japanese university teams around the nation.\nEarly life.\nNicknamed \"Pick\" (short for the freshwater fish pickerel), Fisher was an all-around athlete who played football, basketball, baseball, and competed in track events, though his father permitted sports only if the farm work was done. He played on Vermont's 1904 State Championship football team and was offered multiple college scholarships in football, but his real love was baseball. He stayed on in his hometown, attending Middlebury College.\nProfessional career.\nSemi-pro and minor leagues.\nAfter stellar performances on the college mound, he was offered a position pitching with a semi-pro team in Valleyfield, Quebec in the summer of 1907. In 1908 and 1909 he pitched in the minor leagues for Hartford in the Connecticut League, going 12–1 in his first partial season (batting .304) and 25–4 the following year with 243 strikeouts. Fisher jumped at the first major league opportunity to come his way, thinking it might be the only offer he would get, and his contract was sold to the New York Highlanders (Yankees). He soon learned, however, that the New York Giants and Boston Red Sox were also interested in signing him. He reported to the Highlanders in 1910 following his graduation from Middlebury, bringing along—to the amusement of his new teammates—his homemade bat from off the farm.\nNew York Yankees.\nDubbed the \"Vermont Schoolmaster\" because he taught Latin at Newton Academy in New Jersey during his first offseason, Fisher pitched for New York from 1910 to 1917, spending 1918 in the Army stationed at Fort Slocum off New Rochelle. As a rookie, the newspapers were frequently comparing Fisher to Highlander's spitball pitcher Jack Chesbro, and early in his tenure with the Yankees Fisher was also cited by Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie as one of the 12 best pitchers in the American League, both players also listing Ed Walsh, Russ Ford, Walter Johnson and Smoky Joe Wood. In October 1910, at the end of his rookie season, Fisher pitched against Christy Mathewson in game five of the New York Inter-League Series, a precursor to the Subway Series, losing to Mathewson 5-1. His ERA ranked fifth in the league in 1915. Fisher was known for his stamina as a pitcher, considered a \"workhorse\" for the Yankees, but the following year, 1916, a bout of pleurisy resulted in crippling his effectiveness, and causing him to miss about a month of the season. (Doctors later thought that Fisher had probably had tuberculosis.) In the first game after his return, however, Fisher pitched a shutout against Walter Johnson. From 1911 to 1915, during the offseason, Fisher was also employed as Middlebury College's first \"Physical Director\". \nIn 1915 he was hired as athletic director at , in which capacity he coached the baseball and basketball teams, and assisted with the football team. However, he soon had to resign due to the prolonged illness of his mother.\nCincinnati Reds.\nAbout the time of his discharge from the Army, Fisher was selected off waivers by the Cincinnati Reds, taking a $3,100 cut in pay from his $6,700 with the Yankees. The Yankees may have let Fisher go due to the effects of his pleurisy, but his year in the Army had given him time to build up his strength. Pat Moran, Fisher's manager at Cincinnati noted that, \"Fisher's speed is fine, his curves are all that could be desired. But, beyond all is his headwork. Fisher knows a lot of baseball, far more than the average pitcher.\" Fisher pitched for the Reds in 1919 and 1920. He went 14–5 in 1919 and pitched Game 3 in the infamous 1919 World Series, a game in which the Reds were shut out by Chicago's Dickie Kerr. In the spring of 1920 the American and National Leagues agreed to outlaw use of the spitball, though 22 spitball pitchers were exempted from the ban for the season. The following year a permanent ban went into effect, with 17 pitchers \"grandfathered\" for the remainder of their pitching careers. Though he had largely discontinued use of the spitter by 1914, Fisher was one of those allowed to continue to use the pitch.\n\"Lifetime\" ban.\nFisher is one of the few players to be re-instated into professional baseball after being banned for life. Prior to the 1921 season, the Reds offered him a contract in which his salary was $1,000 less than that of the previous season. After making his objections known in a letter to Reds president August Herrmann, Fisher signed the contract. Before the season began, however, Fisher learned that the position of head baseball coach had again become available at the University of Michigan, a position for which he had belatedly applied the previous year on the recommendation of Branch Rickey. Fisher requested, and was apparently given by manager Pat Moran, permission to go and look into the job.\nWhen he was offered the position at Michigan, the Reds' management tried to induce Fisher to remain with the team by offering to restore the $1,000 cut from the previous year's contract. Fisher thought the Michigan position held greater long-term promise and accepted the job, believing that he would be given his release from Cincinnati or placed on the list of voluntarily retired players (both of which were subsequently reported in the local papers).\nPart way into Michigan's playing season, other teams began contacting Fisher inquiring as to his availability to pitch and coach during the summer, Rickey's St. Louis Cardinals among them. Fisher contacted the Reds for clarification on his status, noting that he realized they had first call on his services. He learned that he was being placed on the list of those ineligible to play, the Reds citing his having given them only seven days notice, rather than the required ten, prior to leaving the club. Fisher appealed to the commissioner of baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, and the commissioner promised to look into the matter.\nAfter obtaining the Reds' version of the negotiations, the commissioner upheld the Reds' position and banned Fisher for leaving the team after having signed a contract. Fisher ended his major league career with a 100–94 record and a 2.82 ERA. His final game was pitched on October 2, 1920, and it was part of the only tripleheader played in the 20th century. Following the determination of his ineligibility, Fisher signed on with one of the \"outlaw\" teams, pitching briefly for the Franklin, Pennsylvania, Oilers before the team folded.\nAbout 1944, as part of a promotion for the Baseball Hall of Fame, Fisher received in the mail a silver lifetime pass to any major league ballpark in the country. The pass was signed by the presidents of both leagues and was inscribed \"To Ray Fisher in appreciation of long and meritorious service\", which Fisher interpreted to mean that his \"blacklisting\" had been lifted. This was his belief for nearly 35 years until he learned late in his life that the blacklisting was still officially on record with the Commissioner's office. In 1951 Fisher was called to Washington, D.C., to testify about his blacklisting in a House Judiciary Committee investigation into the alleged monopoly of power in professional baseball.\nCoaching.\nFisher remained head baseball coach for the University of Michigan's baseball team for 38 seasons. His original agreement with Michigan also assigned him as an assistant basketball coach, a position he held through 1941, and as assistant football coach, in which capacity he served through 1945. In freshman football, he coached Gerald Ford and Tom Harmon. While at Michigan, Fisher led his baseball teams to 15 Big Ten championships and the 1953 College World Series championship, after which he was named Coach of the Year. In 1923, Fisher became Michigan's first coach in the 20th century to integrate a varsity sport.\nIn 1929 and 1932 Fisher's Michigan teams played against teams in Japan at the invitation of Meiji University. The team returned from Japan in October 1929 aboard the , sailing from Yokohama to San Francisco. Fisher was active in the startup of the National Association of College Baseball Coaches and served as its first vice president. During the 1940s he was hailed by sports writers as \"the Fielding Yost of the diamond\" and by \"Esquire Magazine\" as a close second to Jack Barry of Holy Cross as the top college baseball coach in the country. Fisher was generally regarded as one of the nation's premiere instructors of college pitchers. He was known both for his droll sense of humor and his potential for argumentativeness with umpires. The latter may have frequently been strategic; in his later years at Michigan the press sometimes referred to him as \"The Old Fox\". While coaching summer teams in Vermont's Northern League, Fisher mentored Robin Roberts (1946 and 1947), who sent many accolades in Fisher's direction once he was signed into the major leagues.\nRetirement and later life.\nBy the time he retired in 1958, Fisher had compiled a 636–295–8 record as a coach (.600 or better in 32 of 38 seasons) with only two losing seasons, and he held the record as the University of Michigan's winningest coach for 70 years (1930–2000). For five years during the 1960s Fisher coached pitchers for the farm teams of the Milwaukee Braves and the Detroit Tigers, and into his 80s he was still working with pitchers at the request of subsequent University of Michigan baseball coaches.\nWhen Fished learned in 1979 that his blacklisting was still officially on record with the Commissioner's office, a couple of his friends, including former President Gerald Ford, decided to appeal it to Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn. After a reinvestigation of the circumstances of Fisher's leaving the Cincinnati Reds, in 1980 Kuhn declared Fisher a \"retired player in good standing\" and reinstated him to professional baseball, nearly 60 years after Landis's declaration of ineligibility. In a twist of fate, following the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, the Cincinnati Reds came to the University of Michigan for workouts at Ray Fisher Stadium, where they met the 93-year-old former Reds pitcher.\nIn the summer of 1982, Fisher was invited to the yearly Old-Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium, his first visit to the famous facility which had been built after he'd left the team. Approaching age 95, he was then the oldest former Yankee, Cincinnati Red and World Series player. He received two standing ovations from the fans, second only to Joe DiMaggio, and threw out the opening pitch for that day's Yankees-Rangers game. He died three months later in Ann Arbor, Michigan and is buried in Washtenong Memorial Park.\nLegacy.\nAmong his honors, Fisher was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (1959), the American Association of College Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame (1966), the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor (1979), the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame (2013), and the Middlebury Athletics Hall of Fame (2014). Fisher's uniform number has been retired by the Michigan Wolverines baseball team and by the Vermont Mountaineers. At least 19 of Fisher's Michigan players signed with a major league team.\nOn May 23, 1970, twelve years after Fisher's retirement, the baseball stadium at the University of Michigan, until then unnamed, was dedicated as Ray Fisher Stadium. Thirty-eight years later, on May 2, 2008, a renovated Ray Fisher Stadium was incorporated into the university's new Wilpon Baseball and Softball Complex, Fred Wilpon having pitched for Michigan under Fisher.\nOn July 25, 2003, through the efforts of the Vermont chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research, the State of Vermont placed an historic site marker near Ray Fisher's birthplace, at the intersection of U.S. Route 7 (Court Street) and Creek Road in Middlebury, Vermont.\nFisher's influence on pitchers was still being felt many years after his death. In the 2010 American League Championship Series, Texas Rangers pitcher Cliff Lee gave quite a performance using a cut fastball taught to him by \"Ace\" Adams, who had learned the pitch from Fisher at Michigan after the latter's retirement."

It is a sequel to \"International Cricket\" on the original Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was developed by Melbourne House (as Beam Software), with Nintendo publishing the game. Nintendo also included the game with a Super NES console bundle in Australia.\nGameplay.\nEight teams are included: Sri Lanka, Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand, India, Pakistan and the West Indies. However, like its predecessor, \"Super International Cricket\" lacks official team and player licensing.\nThe game comes in three difficulty levels ranging from easy to hard. Games in the \"World Series\" and \"Test match\" modes could go on for five virtual days and still end in a draw.\nSome of the players are named after the game developers (M. Parker is Marshall Parker, G. Anders is Gavan Anderson, A. Milgrom is Alfred Milgrom). Each player has a speed rating that determines how fast that they are able to gather runs for their respective teammates.\nBowlers have a choice between four types of ball delivery using four unique speeds for the actual ball delivery. The Australian method of scoring cricket is used; which is different from the international method. Only one stadium is featured in \"Super International Cricket\".\nSequels.\nMelbourne House followed \"Super International Cricket\" with two sequels, \"Cricket 96\", which was developed in 1996 for EA Sports, and \"Cricket 97\" the year after that. Unlike the FIFA video game series and later cricket titles for EA Sports, the \"International Cricket\" game series were standalone games and never got incremental improvements over the years."

Zones are named 1 through 9 from left to right along the net with the setter occupying Zone 6; and the most common set heights are 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 (represented by a 0 in the notation). For example, a 10 set is a high ball to the left side, a 53 is a 3 foot high set to the middle of the court (in front of the setter), and a 61 is a 1 foot high set right behind the setter."

St. John, (Ohio State University Athletic Director, 1912–1947). The golf club has two classical golf courses called Scarlet and Gray. The Scarlet was completed in 1938 and the Gray was finished later in 1940. The dedication ceremony was held on May 18, 1940, when Bob Kepler (golf coach from 1938 to 1965), Chick Evans, Blanche Sohl, and Patty Berg played 18 holes on the Scarlet course.\nBoth the Scarlet and the much shorter Gray golf courses were designed by Dr. Alister MacKenzie, a world-renowned golf course architect. The Scarlet course is rated as one of the top collegiate courses in the nation. In 2005 and 2006 the Scarlet Course underwent a major restoration project overseen by former Buckeye legend Jack Nicklaus that was intended to restore play on the Scarlet course to the way that MacKenzie had envisioned it.\nIn 1941, Ohio State made history when it hosted the first ever women's collegiate golf championship on the Scarlet course. In 1982, Ohio State hosted the final Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) Division I National Championship. In 1991, Ohio State hosted the NCAA Women's Championship, commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the national tournament for women on the course on which it was conceived. The women's program later went on to host the 1997 and 2006 tournaments as well. The Scarlet Course has also played host to 10 men's National Championships. Over the years the Ohio State Scarlet course has been the site of several U.S. Open qualifiers, U.S. Amateur qualifiers and the 1977 USGA Junior Championship."

        "title": "George Kingston (ice hockey)",
        "text": "George Kingston (born August 20, 1939) is a Canadian ice hockey coach. He was the long-time coach of the University of Calgary hockey team, and coached the Canadian Men's Team to a gold medal at the 1988 Spengler Cup as well as coaching the Canadian men's national ice hockey team at the 1994 Ice Hockey World Championships and winning the first gold medal for Canada in 33 years. He was named a 2019 Order of Hockey in Canada recipient.\nBiography.\nBorn in Biggar, Saskatchewan, Kingston played hockey as a youth, and was signed by the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League in 1953. However, he decided to attend the University of Alberta instead. He had to quit hockey due to shoulder injuries, and in 1967, was hired by the University of Calgary as an assistant coach. Named head coach in 1968, he served in that role until 1986, also becoming an assistant professor. At Calgary he had a 245–128 record and led the university to five Western Canadian University championships. While coaching at Calgary he also completed a master's degree, and in 1977 finished a PhD; his dissertation was based on travels to Europe to study coaching, and was titled \"The Organization and Development of Ice Hockey during Childhood in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Sweden and Canada\".\nKingston was a volunteer with Hockey Canada programming for ten years, including roles with the 1980, 1984, 1988 and 1994 Olympic teams. His success at the University of Calgary led Kingston to offers as an assistant coach in the National Hockey League, where he served as an assistant for the Calgary Flames from 1980 to 1982 and the Minnesota North Stars during the 1988–89 NHL season. In 1989, Kingston was appointed the head coach of the Norway men's national ice hockey team, which he held until 1991.\nAfter two years in Norway, which included a best-ever finish for the junior national team and a significant improvement and solid preparation for Norway which hosted the Lillehammer Olympics, Kingston was named as the head coach of the expansion San Jose Sharks. The Sharks posted a 28–129–7 record in two seasons under Kingston's watch, and he was released following the 1992–93 NHL season. Following this, Kingston was hired as director of hockey operations with responsibilities to serve as general manager and mentor coach for the Canadian Olympic team at the 1994 Winter Olympics, where Canada won silver. Kingston then went on to be the head coach of Team Canada at the World Championships in Bolzano/Milano, winning the gold medal in the tournament. The success at the World Championship did not go unnoticed, as following the tournament, Kingston became coach of the Germany men's national ice hockey team, which enjoyed a number of successes, including participating in the final round of the World Cup of Hockey in 1996. In 1999, Kingston was hired by another NHL expansion team, this time becoming an assistant coach for the Atlanta Thrashers. After two years in Atlanta, he joined the Florida Panthers as an assistant in 2001, coaching there until 2007.\nHe next coached Norway's national women's team and laid the foundation with very young players who moved up the ladder in international hockey, and assisted the men's national team in qualifying for the Vancouver Olympics, as well as being a special consultant to the Norwegian Ice Hockey Federation and Olympiatoppen, the Norwegian Olympic Program. He was assistant coach of Norway men's sledgehockey team, a bronze medal winner at the Vancouver Paralympics in Vancouver.\nCoaching style.\nKingston developed a reputation as a \"teaching coach\", in that he was interested in showing players how to play better, and not just giving instructions as was common in the 1960s and 1970s. Kingston was interested in the developments made in the Soviet Union towards coaching, and in 1971 spent five months in Europe learning coaching techniques, including three and a half weeks in the USSR, even being allowed to watch national team practices. He took a sabbatical in 1974–75 and returned to Europe, spending time in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden to see how their hockey programs worked. This formed the basis of his PhD research. In 1976 he was one of six people assigned by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) to study a team at the 1976 Canada Cup, and wrote a report on his observations for further study. Kingston has done extensive research into all aspects of the game of hockey, and is well-known through the combination of coaching, research, and presenting his work in IIHF, NHL and numerous world hockey forums. He serves as a volunteer managing director of the NHL Coaches' Association, and as an assistant coach of Lithuania national ice hockey team."

        "text": "Hugh Thomas Casey (October 14, 1913 – July 3, 1951) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher. He played for the Chicago Cubs (1935), Brooklyn Dodgers (1939–42 and 1946–48), Pittsburgh Pirates (1949), and New York Yankees (1949).\nBaseball career.\nCasey was born in Atlanta in 1913. He started his professional baseball career with the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association at the age of 18. Except for a brief stint with the Chicago Cubs in 1935, he pitched mostly in the minor leagues from 1932 to 1938.\nAfter going 13–14 for Memphis in 1938, Casey was drafted by the Brooklyn Dodgers. He was a starter and reliever for the Dodgers from 1939 to 1941, winning over 10 games each season. In 1941, Casey helped the Dodgers win the National League championship. He is perhaps best known for an alleged wild pitch that he threw in the ninth inning of Game 4 in the 1941 World Series which precipitated a New York Yankees rally. Catcher Mickey Owen thought that the pitch was a spitball, but Casey always swore it was not. Officially, the play was recorded as a passed ball. Brooklyn lost the game and, eventually, the series. Casey went 0–2.\nCasey was used mostly as a reliever in 1942 and led the league in saves. In January 1943, during World War II, Casey entered the United States Navy. He was discharged in December 1945. Upon his return to the Dodgers, he had two good seasons in 1946 and 1947. In 1947, Casey led the National League in saves for the second time. He pitched well in the 1947 World Series, going 2–0 with a save, but the Dodgers lost in seven games.\nLike many of the colorful Dodger players during that era, Casey had his share of adventure. His teammates later recalled a time in which he sparred with writer Ernest Hemingway in Hemingway's house.\nAfter 1947, Casey lost his effectiveness, and his major league career ended in 1949. He went 10–4 for his old team, the Crackers, in 1950; Atlanta won the pennant.\nLater life.\nTowards the end of his life, Casey ran a restaurant in Brooklyn.\nOn July 3, 1951, Casey died in Atlanta from a self-inflicted shotgun blast to the neck while his estranged wife was pleading with him on the phone. Casey was upset that he had recently been named as the father of a child by another woman in a paternity suit. He was 37 years old.\nCasey was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1991."

        "text": "The 37th Ryder Cup Matches were held September 19–21, 2008, in the United States at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky. Team USA won 16 – 11 to end the streak of three successive victories for Europe. This was USA's largest margin of victory since 1981 and the first time since 1979 that the Americans had held the lead after every session of play. The team captains were Paul Azinger for the US and Nick Faldo for Europe.\nThe U.S. team had been in the lead since the contest began on the Friday. Europe was two points behind going into the Sunday singles matches. They had only previously overturned a deficit once before, in 1995. USA won the majority of the first matches out and subsequently Jim Furyk defeated Miguel Ángel Jiménez 2 &amp; 1 to win his match and win the Ryder Cup for the USA. Other matches still out on the course would see this margin of victory increase further. Following the defeat Nick Faldo was heavily criticised for his decision to \"bottom load\" his best players in the singles when the Americans only needed 5 points to win which they got before they could have any effect on the overall outcome.\nTelevision.\nAll matches were covered live in the United States. ESPN handled Friday coverage. Mike Tirico and Andy North hosted from the 18th tower, with Curtis Strange calling holes, and on-course reporters Billy Kratzert and Judy Rankin. With Azinger, ESPN's lead analyst, captaining the U.S. team, North was moved to the booth to fill Azinger's seat. NBC Sports covered the weekend action, with Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosting from the 18th tower, Gary Koch and Bob Murphy calling holes, and on-course reporters Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and Dottie Pepper.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format used in 2008 was:\nWith a total of 28 points available, 14 points were required to win the cup, and 14 points for the defending champion to retain it. All matches were played over a maximum 18 holes.\nFor the first time since 1995, the opening matches featured foursomes. US captain Paul Azinger chose the format, hoping to give his team an early advantage in Kentucky. Foursomes was used in the first sessions of every event since 1981 until European captain Seve Ballesteros opened with better ball (fourball) in 1997 at Valderrama.\nTeam qualification and selection.\nUnited States.\nThe selection process was radically changed for 2008. The United States team consisted of:\nEurope.\nThe qualification process was the same as in 2006. The European team consisted of:\nThe final line-up for the European team was announced after the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles on August 31, 2008.

        "title": "Middlesex county cricket teams",
        "text": "County cricket teams representing Middlesex have been traced back to the 18th century, although for long periods the county was secondary to the London Cricket Club which played at the Artillery Ground. Middlesex teams played at various grounds throughout what is now the Greater London area. Islington and Uxbridge were often used but home matches were also played on Kennington Common and in Berkshire. Middlesex teams were less frequent in the 19th century until 1859 when the Walker family of Southgate became involved in county cricket.\nUntil 1863, teams were formed \"ad hoc\" by various patrons and clubs, often on an informal basis. Depending on the strength of the opposition, teams called Middlesex have generally been recognised as top-class. Middlesex County Cricket Club was founded in December 1863 and its team has been recognised as the county's representative in first-class cricket from the 1864 season.\n17th century.\nAs elsewhere in south east England, cricket became established in Middlesex during the 17th century and the earliest village matches took place before the English Civil War. The first definite mention of cricket in London or Middlesex dates from 1680.\n18th century.\nVenues.\nThe earliest known match in Middlesex took place at Lamb's Conduit Field in Holborn on 3 July 1707 involving teams from London and Croydon. In 1718, the first reference is found to White Conduit Fields in Islington, which later became a famous London venue. The earliest reference to a team called Middlesex is on 5 August 1729 in a match against London Cricket Club \"in the fields behind the Woolpack, in Islington, near Sadlers Wells, for £50 a side\".\n1731 controversy.\nThere was a much-publicised controversial incident on Monday, 23 August 1731, when a Middlesex team led by Thomas Chambers played against the Duke of Richmond's XI, effectively a Sussex county team, in a match on Richmond Green. It was the return to a match in Chichester a week earlier. In both matches, the stake was 200 guineas. Middlesex won the first match. According to John Major, their patron Chambers was a probable forebear of Lord Frederick Beauclerk.\nThe second match is notable in one sense as the earliest of which the team scores are known: Richmond's XI 79, Middlesex 119; Richmond's XI 72, and Middlesex 23–5 (approximate). It was agreed beforehand that the match would end promptly at seven o'clock in the evening, and Richmond enforced this agreement even though the match had not started on time because he himself arrived late. The result was therefore a draw – the earliest known use of this term for a result.\nThe state of play at seven o'clock was that Middlesex needed only \"about 8 to 10 notches\" with either four or five wickets standing. Gambling was rife in eighteenth century cricket and, a large crowd in attendance, a lot of money was riding on a Middlesex win. There was uproar about the prompt finish making no allowance for the delayed start. When Richmond refused to play on, the crowd rioted and some of the Sussex players \"had the shirts ripped off their backs\". It was said a lawsuit \"will commence about the play\". On Wednesday, 8 September, the \"Daily Post Boy\" reported that \"(on 6 September) 11 of Surrey beat the 11 who about a fortnight ago beat the Duke of Richmond's men\". This would suggest that the Duke of Richmond conceded his controversial game against Chambers' Middlesex.\nMiddlesex at Lord's.\nMiddlesex used Lord's Old Ground when it opened in 1787, with the earliest known match on the ground being between Middlesex and an Essex XI on 31 May 1787. Noted Middlesex players in the 18th century included William Fennex and Thomas Lord.\nThe Thursday Club.\nIn May–June 1795, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) played five matches at Lord's Old Ground, the first three against a team called \"the Thursday Club\" and the last two against a team called \"Middlesex\". Although Arthur Haygarth makes no comment about the members of these two teams, it is evident that several players are common to both as James Rice (5 appearances), William Barton (4), James Beeston (4), John Goldham (4), Thomas Lord (4), Sylvester (4), Charles Warren (4), Harry Bridger (3) and Wheeler (2) all played for both the Thursday and Middlesex teams. N. Graham (2), Thomas Ray (2) and Robert Turner (2) played for Middlesex but not for Thursday; Ray also played once for MCC against Thursday. George Shepheard (3), W. Beeston (2) and Dale (2) played only for Thursday and not for Middlesex. Six others, including Thomas Shackle, played for one of the teams in a single match only.\nDetails are sketchy but it seems the Marylebone Thursday Club was originally a Thursday Club in the literal sense that was started by amateur cricketers of Middlesex who acquired the services of certain Middlesex professionals, such as Ray and Sylvester who were both employed at Lord's as MCC ground staff players. Team nomenclature changed frequently in Georgian times. Samuel Britcher, who was the MCC scorer calls the team \"Thursday Club\" in the first three matches of 1795 (as does Haygarth) but then refers to \"the County of Middlesex\" in both the fourth and fifth games on 25 May and 26 June. Haygarth simply uses \"Middlesex\" for these two. Britcher refers to the \"Middlesex Club\" from 1796.\n19th century.\nThe present Middlesex County Cricket Club was informally founded on 15 December 1863 at a meeting in the \"London Tavern\" with formal constitution taking place on 2 February 1864. The creation of the club was largely through the efforts of the Walker family of Southgate. The county club played its first first-class match against Sussex County Cricket Club at Islington in June 1864. There is an article about early Middlesex cricket in the 14 September 1882 issue of \"\"."

        "title": "EU–US Open Skies Agreement",
        "text": "The EU–US Open Skies Agreement is an open skies air transport agreement between the European Union (EU) and the United States (US). The agreement allows any airline of the European Union and any airline of the United States to fly between any point in the European Union and any point in the United States. Both EU and US airlines are allowed to fly on to a further destination in another country after their initial stop (Fifth Freedom rights). Because the EU is not treated as a single territory for the purposes of the agreement, this means in practice that US airlines can fly between two points in the EU as long as that flight is the continuation of a flight that started in the US (e.g. New York - Paris - Berlin). Airlines of the EU are also allowed to fly between the US and non-EU countries that are part of the European Common Aviation Area, like Switzerland. EU and US airlines can operate all-cargo flights under Seventh Freedom rights, meaning US airlines' all-cargo flights can be operated from one EU country to any other country (including another EU country) and EU airlines' all-cargo flights can operate between the US and any other country. Norway and Iceland acceded to the Agreement from 2011 and their airlines enjoy the same rights as EU airlines.\nThe treaty disappointed European airlines as they felt it was tilted in favour of United States airlines: while US airlines are allowed to operate intra-EU flights (if this is an all-cargo flight or a passenger flight if it is the second leg of a flight started in the US), European airlines are not permitted to operate intra-US flights nor are they allowed to purchase a controlling stake in a US operator. The Agreement replaced and superseded previous open skies agreements between the US and individual European countries.\nThe initial agreement was signed in Washington, D.C., on 30 April 2007. The agreement became effective 30 March 2008. Phase two was signed in June 2010 and it has been applied provisionally, pending ratification by all signatories.\nImpact.\nLondon–United States.\nUnder the agreement, London Heathrow was opened to full competition. This ended the exclusive right granted for only two US airlines and two UK airlines (established under Bermuda II Agreement in 1977, which remains in force for UK overseas territories' traffic rights to the US) to fly transatlantic services out of Heathrow. These four airlines were British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines, and American Airlines.\nThis right also exists for third-country carriers with incumbent fifth freedom rights to carry passengers between Heathrow and the United States. These rights were previously exercised by Air New Zealand (between Los Angeles and Heathrow), Air India (between New York-JFK and London Heathrow), and Kuwait Airways (also between New York-JFK and London Heathrow). El Al also had such rights but chose not to use them, and Iran Air technically also had similar rights, but is prohibited from flying to the US due to US government economic sanctions against Iran.\nDelta Air Lines began services to Heathrow from Atlanta, New York–JFK, Boston, Detroit and Seattle/Tacoma in 2008. Other airlines, such as Northwest Airlines, Continental Airlines and US Airways also began services to Heathrow, but have since ceased independent operations under these brand names, following their respective mergers with Delta, United, and American.\nNevertheless, expansion of transatlantic flights to or from Heathrow continue to be limited by lack of runway capacity (currently its two runways operate at over 98 percent capacity), government limits (especially when expansion plans to build a third runway and a sixth terminal were cancelled on 12 May 2010, by the new coalition government), and the fact that many take-off slots are owned by incumbent airlines (IAG's airlines, including British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia, account for 54% of slots).\nFares.\nThere is little consensus about whether increased transatlantic competition will have any effect on fares. Some believe the market is already highly competitive. Other sources have been predicting radical changes, such as €10 flights. \nThere have been a number of new entrants that have come into the market in recent years, who have adapted the model of the short-haul low-cost airlines to the transatlantic route. Initially in 2007, Ryanair announced that it was planning to start a new airline (RyanAtlantic) that would operate long-haul flights between Europe and the United States but that project was cancelled. However, in 2014 Norwegian Air Shuttle announced it would start low-cost flights to the US from the Republic of Ireland and later the UK, in part made possible by new wide-body and narrow-body aircraft with increased fuel efficiency and range. Its Irish and then its new UK subsidiaries applied for US permission to operate these routes, which was met with resistance in the US. Eventually, after the European Commission said it would initiate arbitration procedures under the Agreement, the US granted the Norwegian subsidiaries rights to fly to the US. Other long-haul low-cost airlines, such as LEVEL, Primera Air and Wow Air, have since entered the market, however the latter two have since ceased operation.\nConsequences of the UK leaving the EU.\nThere was some debate as to what consequences the UK leaving the EU (Brexit) in 2020 would have on UK and United States airlines flying between the UK and United States. Both the EU and the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, have since confirmed it was likely the UK would leave the EU-US Open Skies Agreement. It has subsequently emerged that the UK has initiated negotiations with the US on a future US-UK Air Transport Agreement.\nIn November 2018, the UK concluded an individual open sky agreement with the US that will supersede the EU agreement post-Brexit."

        "title": "World Judo Championships",
        "text": "The World Judo Championships are the highest level of international judo competition, along with the Olympic judo competition. The championships are held once every year (except the years when the Olympics take place) by the International Judo Federation, and qualified judoka compete in their respective categories as representatives of their home countries. Team competitions have also been held since 1994. The men's championships began in 1956, though the format and periodicity of the championships have changed over time. The last edition of the championships took place in Doha, Qatar in 2023.\nHistory.\nThe first edition of the world championships took place in Tokyo, Japan in 1956. There were no weight classes at the time and Japanese judoka Shokichi Natsui became the first world champion in history, defeating fellow countryman Yoshihiko Yoshimatsu in the final. The second world championship was also held in Tokyo two years later, with the Japanese winning the top two spots in the competition for the second time. In 1961, the championship was held outside Japan for the first time, and Dutch judoka Anton Geesink defeated the prior world champion, Koji Sone, in Paris, France, to become the first non-Japanese world champion.\nThe 1965 World Judo Championships were held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and weight classes were implemented for the first time with the addition of the −68 kg, −80 kg, and +80 kg categories. Judo had become an Olympic sport at the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, and a permanent sport after a brief absence at the 1968 Summer Olympics.\nDespite this progressive enlargement, it took until 1980 for women to participate in the world championships. The first women's world championships were held in New York City in 1980, and were held in alternating years as the men's championships until the 1987 World Judo Championships in Essen, where the two competitions were merged into one world championship. The mixed championships have been held biannually since 1987. In 2005, the world championships made its debut on the African continent in Cairo, Egypt. In the International Judo Federation meeting held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2007 (during the 2007 World Judo Championships), it was decided that France would host the world championships for the fifth time in 2011.\nWeight classes.\nThere are currently 16 tournaments in the world championships, with 8 weight classes for each gender.\nCompetitions by year.\nThe world championships have been held in every continent except Oceania and Antarctica.\nWorld Team Judo Championships.\nThe first World Team Judo Championships was held in 1994 as separate event and only for men's national teams. The first World Team Judo Championships for women's national team was held as separate event in 1997. Since 1998, World Team Judo Championships for men's and women's national teams have been held at the same time and venue. It were held every four years until 2006 (although promotional team events were held during 2003 and 2005 World Judo Championships) and every year from 2007 to 2015 (except 2009). Since 2011 men's and women's team competitions became the part of World Judo Championships. Starting from 2017, it were merged into mixed team competition. Judokas who participates in the individual events at the World Championships often do not participate in the team competition.\nMedal tables.\nThe results of promotional team events which were held during 2003 and 2005 World Judo Championships are not included into overall statistics.\nAll-time medal count.\n\"List of World Judo Championships medalists\"\nUpdated after the 2023 World Judo Championships.\n\"This table include all medals in the individual and team competitions won at the World Judo Championships as well as at the separate World Team Judo Championships and separate World Judo Open Championships.\"\nMultiple gold medalists.\nBoldface denotes active judokas and highest medal count among all judokas (including these who not included in these tables) per type."

        "title": "EuroCup Basketball",
        "text": "EuroCup Basketball, commonly known as the EuroCup and currently called BKT EuroCup for sponsorship reasons, is an annual professional basketball club competition organized by Euroleague Basketball. The league is regarded as Euroleague Basketball's second-tier professional basketball club tournament.\nFounded as ULEB Cup in 2002, the competition lasted until 2008 when a new competition was introduced after an agreement between ULEB and FIBA under the name of \"EuroCup\" for the 2008–09 season, following a change in format. Given that the FIBA EuroChallenge was known as EuroCup until 2008, a new era of stronger cooperation between ULEB and FIBA Europe was set in 2008. The number of the new competition was increased to a total of 48 and the winner of the 3d tier FIBA EuroCup Challenge, formerly known as EuroCup would get an automatic qualification for the tournament's following season, for first time.\nThough initially advertised as a new competition, the ULEB Cup and EuroCup Basketball are now considered the same competition, with the change of name being simply a re-branding.\nSince the 2021–22 season both EuroCup finalists qualify for next season's EuroLeague. Until then only the winner was entitled to the one year licence.\nThe title has been won by 14 clubs, 3 of which have won the title more than once. The most successful club in the competition are Valencia Basket, with four titles. The current champions are Gran Canaria, winning their first title after defeating Turk Telekom in the 2023 Finals.\nHistory.\nThe competition was created in 2002, as the ULEB Cup, and has had several names:\nSponsorship names.\nOn 7 July 2016, Chipita and Euroleague Basketball announced a strategic agreement to sponsor the European competition across the globe. According to the agreement, starting with the 2016–17 season, the competition would be named 7DAYS EuroCup. This title partnership was set to run for three seasons.\nQualification.\nClubs qualify for the competition based on their performance in their domestic leagues competitions. For this purpose, the clubs from countries participating in the ABA League qualify for the competition based on their performance in the ABA League, and not their domestic leagues.\nFormat.\nStarting with the 2016–17 season, the EuroCup's first phase is the Regular Season, in which 20 teams participate. The participants include 20 clubs automatically entered into the Regular Season. Each team plays two games (home-and-away) against every other team in its group. At the end of the Regular Season, the field is cut from 20 to 16. The next phase, known as the Top 16, then begins, featuring the 16 survivors of the Regular Season in four-team groups. As in the Regular Season, each Top 16 group is contest in a double round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the third phase, the Playoffs. Each playoff series is best-of-three, and the winners of each series advance to the next round persistently until the Finals. Home advantage in the series goes to the best placed team in the Top 16. The Finals features the two remaining series winners in a best-of-three series with home advantage in the series to the best placed team in the Top 16.\nPrevious EuroCup formats.\nHistorically, the competition began with a group phase in which the starting field was reduced to 16 teams. The survivors then advanced to a knockout phase. In the inaugural 2002–03 season, the knockout phase consisted entirely of two-legged ties. In the following 2003–04 season, the final became a one-off game, but all other knockout ties remained two-legged.\nIn the 2007–08 season, the initial phase, now called the Regular Season, was only used to reduce the field to 32 teams. The survivors were paired into two-legged knockout ties, with the winners advancing to another set of two-legged ties. The survivors then entered the first-ever Final Eight phase in the competition's history, consisting of one-off knockout games.\nThe following 2008–09 season, was the first in which preliminary rounds were conducted. That year saw two preliminary rounds held, the first involving 16 teams, and the second involving the eight winners, plus eight teams that had received byes into that round. The survivors of the second preliminary round joined 24 direct qualifiers in the Regular Season. This season also saw the introduction of the Last 16 group phase, and proved to be the last for the Final Eight.\nThe last stage of the EuroCup, the EuroCup Finals, was reduced from eight teams to four, starting with the 2009–10 season. This stage was directly analogous to the EuroLeague Final Four, and like that stage of the EuroLeague, consisted of one-off knockout semifinals, followed by a single-game final. Unlike the EuroLeague Final Four, in which the third-place game and final are held two days after the semifinals, the corresponding games of the EuroCup were held the day after the semifinals.\nIn the 2012–13 season, the final was decided by a single game format, after double-legged semifinals and quarterfinals. For the 2013–14 season, the competition increased from 32 to 48 teams in the Regular Season phase. Another innovation that started in the 2013–14 season, was that the clubs were divided into two regional conferences, the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference, for the Regular Season phase. The size of the groups grew to six teams, where the first three qualified teams joined the Last 32 stage. In addition, the eight EuroLeague clubs that did not qualify for the EuroLeague Top 16 phase, joined the remaining 24 EuroCup teams and the Finals were decided by a double-legged series.\nFor the 2014–15 season, the competition contained 36 teams at the group stage. There were 6 groups, each containing 6 teams. The 36 teams consisted of the 7 teams that were eliminated in the 2014–15 Euroleague season qualification rounds, and 29 teams that qualified directly to the 2014–15 EuroCup, either through 2013–14 season results, or through wild cards. The top four teams from each of the Regular Season groups with the eight EuroLeague clubs that did not qualify for the EuroLeague Top 16 phase qualified to join the Last 32 stage. For the 2015–16 season, the competition contained 36 clubs automatically entered into the Regular Season and the eight EuroLeague clubs that did not qualify for the EuroLeague Top 16 phase qualified to join the Last 32 stage.\nArena standards.\nEffective as of the 2012–13 season, all EuroCup clubs must host their home games in arenas that have a regular seating capacity of at least 2,500 (all seated), and an additional minimum capacity of 200 VIP seats available. By comparison, EuroLeague licensed clubs host their home games in arenas that seat at least 10,000 people, while EuroLeague associated clubs must have arenas that seat 5,000.\nAwards.\nAfter a given EuroCup season, before the finals, annual EuroCup awards are handed out to players and coaches. These awards include:\nPerformance by club.\nA total number of 181 clubs from 30 countries have participated in the competition."

        "text": "Patrick Williams Sr. (born October 24, 1972) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for 14 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Texas A&amp;M Aggies. He was signed by the Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent in 1997. Williams also played for the Minnesota Vikings, with whom he was a three-time Pro Bowl selection.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from Wossman High School in Monroe, Louisiana, Williams attended Navarro College, where he was a two-time junior college All-American in 1992 and 1993. He initially transferred to Texas A&amp;M University in 1994, but failed the math portion of a junior-college exit exam and was ruled ineligible for the 1994 season. He transferred again to Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M College, where he graduated in 1995, before returning to Texas A&amp;M. Williams earned 2nd-team All-SWC as a junior in 1995 in only 6 starts. He also started 8 games and appeared in 11 as a senior.\nProfessional career.\nBuffalo Bills.\nWilliams went undrafted in the 1997 NFL draft, and signed with the Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent the same year. He played in just one game his rookie season. During the 1998–2000 seasons, he was a regular contributor, but did not become a regular starter until the 2001 season. In 2000, he was named to USA Today’s All-Joe Team, recognizing the NFL’s most \"overlooked, ignored and hard-working\" players. Williams intercepted his first career pass and returned it 20 yards for a touchdown, picking off Miami Dolphins quarterback A. J. Feeley on December 5, 2004, sealing the win for Buffalo 42-32 and breaking open a 3-point game with 1:55 left to play. Williams was named 2003 winner of the Ed Block Courage Award by his teammates. During his final four seasons with the Bills (2001–2004), he started in all but four games. He became a free agent after the 2004 season.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nPrior to the 2005 season, Williams signed with the Minnesota Vikings, the 1st signing for the team in 2005 free agency and a priority signing. Following an advice by then defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin, Williams lost 15 pounds in the offseason. Williams played nose tackle in the Minnesota Vikings 4-3 defense, with teammate Kevin Williams playing the Under Tackle position. They were known collectively as the \"Williams Wall\" as well as the \"Williams Wrecking Crew\" due to their physical presence at the line of scrimmage, an attribute that helped them lead the Vikings to the best rushing defense in the league for three consecutive seasons (2006-2008). As a player for the Vikings, he was selected to his first Pro Bowl in 2006, and followed with consecutive selections in 2007 and 2008. He was also a second-team All-Pro selection in 2007.\nOn December 2, 2008, Pat and teammate Kevin Williams were suspended for 4 games by the league for violating its anti-doping policy, for use of a diuretic, which can be used a masking agent for steroid use. It is believed that the diuretic was found in a weight-loss supplement that he had been taking. Williams, along with Kevin Williams, appealed the suspension to a Minnesota federal court; the judge ruled against the NFL's decision and allowed all suspended players, including Williams, to play until a further review of the case.\nOn April 28, 2011, the Minnesota Supreme Court declined to consider Williams' appeal of the case, clearing the way for the NFL to suspend Williams.\nIn the 2009 season, Williams made 44 tackles, 2 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles. He announced that he might retire after the season, but decided to come back for one more year in 2010. He was the oldest defensive player in the NFL.\nOn March 2, 2011, Williams announced that he would not re-sign with the Vikings for the 2011 season. \"Everything’s good. I am not coming back. Going to go finish elsewhere.\" He ended his NFL career playing nose tackle when he retired.\nOn April 23, 2013, Pat Williams signed a one-day contract so that he could retire as a Minnesota Viking.\nPat Williams coaches at Wossman High School as a defensive line coach.\nPat Williams helped create a Lineman Academy located at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota."

The series, created in 1978, today comprises 14 leagues on all continents. The best riders from 132 preliminary competitions qualify for the final. The FEI World Cup was thought up by a Swiss journalist and show jumping enthusiast, Max E. Ammann. For 20 years, until 1999, both the final and qualifiers were sponsored by Volvo. From 1999 to 2013, the series has been sponsored by Rolex. Longines has been the title sponsor of the series since October 2013.\nApproximately 45 riders qualify from 13 leagues around the world. Usually there are 20 riders from Europe, 15 from the United States, 5 from Canada, and 5 from elsewhere in the world. At the beginning, the final was a rather complicated process and in 1981 its formula was modified. Since then it has not been changed.

        "text": "The UCI Road World Championships are the annual world championships for bicycle road racing organized by the (UCI). The UCI Road World Championships consist of events for road race and individual time trial, and , a mixed team relay.\nEvents.\nAll the world championship events are ridden by national teams, not trade teams such as in most other major races. The winner of each category is entitled to wear the rainbow jersey in races of that category (either mass start or time trial) until the next championships.\nIt currently includes the following championships:\nFormer events:\nHistory.\nThe first world championships took place in 1921, though the only event that was contested was the men's road race for amateurs. The first professional world championship took place in July 1927 at the Nürburgring in Germany where Italian Alfredo Binda won the professional men's race and Belgian Jean Aerts won the men's amateur race. The women's road race was introduced in 1958. A men's team time trial, contested by national teams, was introduced in 1962. Beginning in 1972, the team time trial was discontinued in Olympic years only. Individual time trials in all categories were added in 1994, which was also the last year for the original incarnation of the men's team time trial. In 2012, the men's team time trial was reinstated, and a women's team time trial added to the program; both were contested by trade teams. In 2019, the team time trial events for men and women were replaced by a mixed relay team time trial.\nUntil 1995, there were separate races for male professional and amateur riders. In 1996, the amateur category was replaced with a category for men under-23 years old, with the professional category becoming an open (later elite) category.\nFrom 1995 until 2022, the event was held towards the end of the European season in late September, usually following the . Before that, the event had always been a summer race, held in late August or the first week of September (except for 1970, when it was a mid-season summer event).\nFrom 2023, every fourth year the event will held as part of the combined multi-disciplinary UCI Cycling World Championships, the inaugural edition of which will be held in August.\nThe world championships are located in a different city or region every year. The event can be held over a relatively flat course which favors cycling sprinters or a hilly course which favors a climbing specialist or all-rounder. In each case, the course is usually held on a circuit, of which the riders complete multiple laps.\nThe world championship road race and two of the three Grand Tours (namely the and the ) form the Triple Crown of Cycling.\nEditions.\nNote: Not held from 1939 to 1945 because of World War II.\nAll Medals.\nMedal table includes only medals achieved in senior events. Mixed nation team events such as the Team Time Trial from 2012 to 2018 are excluded."

        "text": "Shane O'Brien (born August 9, 1983) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. His National Hockey League (NHL) career lasted nine years.\nPlaying career.\nAnaheim Ducks and Tampa Bay Lightning.\nPlaying major junior in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), O'Brien was drafted by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the 8th round, 250th overall, in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. Before earning a full-time roster spot with Anaheim, he played with their minor league affiliates, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks and Portland Pirates of the American Hockey League (AHL). O'Brien led all AHL defenceman in scoring during the 2006 Calder Cup playoffs with six goals and 22 points in 19 post-season games. The Pirates had made it to the semi-finals where they were defeated in seven games by the Hershey Bears. In the off-season, he was re-signed by the Ducks to a one-year contract on August 3, 2006.\nO'Brien made his NHL debut against the Los Angeles Kings on October 6, 2006. He scored his first NHL goal later that month against Dominik Hašek in a 4–1 win over the Detroit Red Wings on October 18. He completed the night with a Gordie Howe hat trick by getting an assist and a fight against Brad Norton. On November 8, he scored a goal and two assists against the Vancouver Canucks for a three-point night.\nAt the trade deadline on February 24, 2007, O'Brien was dealt with a third-round draft pick in 2007 to the Tampa Bay Lightning for goaltender Gerald Coleman and a first-round draft pick in 2007. He had established himself as a fighter during his rookie season. At the time of his trade, he was ranked fifth in the league in fights with 12. Making the transition to Tampa Bay, however, his role as an enforcer was diminished as the club was less prone to fight than the Ducks had been. He made his NHL playoff debut with the Lightning on April 12, meeting the New Jersey Devils in the first round.\nAfter finishing his rookie season with a combined total of two goals and 16 points in the regular season between Anaheim and Tampa Bay, he was re-signed by the Lightning in the off-season. At $2 million over two years, the contract saw O'Brien make $875,000 the first year and $1.125 million in 2008–09 – a raise from his $495,000 salary of the previous season. He would improve to four goals and 21 points in the subsequent season.\nVancouver Canucks.\nOn October 6, 2008, O'Brien was traded with forward Michel Ouellet to the Vancouver Canucks for defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and prospect Juraj Šimek. During his first year in Vancouver, O'Brien received a minor fine of $2,500 on January 29, 2009, after taking part in a post-game altercation with Ryane Clowe and Joe Pavelski of the San Jose Sharks nine days earlier on January 20. Pavelski allegedly speared Canucks forward Daniel Sedin at the end of the game, a 2–1 overtime loss, leading O'Brien and teammate Willie Mitchell to intervene.\nSoon thereafter, O'Brien garnered significant media attention when, after being unexpectedly made a healthy scratch, he claimed that general manager Mike Gillis implied in a one-on-one meeting that he is only interested in him fighting. O'Brien went on to speculate to the media whether Vancouver was the right fit for him. After another meeting with Gillis the next day, O'Brien apologized through the media for what he described as \"selfish\" comments borne of frustration, and that he misunderstood Gillis in their initial meeting.\nIn the subsequent 2009 playoffs, O'Brien scored his first goal as a Canuck against the Chicago Blackhawks in game six of the second round. The goal tied the score at 3–3 in the second period, although Chicago went on to eliminate the Canucks 7–5.\nBecoming a restricted free agent in the off-season, O'Brien re-signed with the Canucks to a one-year, $1.6 million contract after turning down the arbitration process. Following an altercation with the New York Rangers on November 3, 2009, O'Brien was suspended for one game by the NHL for poking Rangers forward Sean Avery from across the two teams' benches with his stick. On December 20, 2009, O'Brien scored his first goal in 102 regular-season games in a 3–1 loss to the St. Louis Blues.\nLater in the season, on March 30, 2010, head coach Alain Vigneault announced that O'Brien would sit out the next three games for disciplinary reasons. According to the Team 1040, a local sports radio station, O'Brien showed up late for the previous Monday's practice. Besides the incident, however, Vigneault added there was more to the situation than O'Brien being late. O'Brien was not permitted to skate with the team until April 4. He finished his second season in Vancouver with two goals and eight points over 65 games. In the 2010 playoffs, he added a goal and two assists in 12 games as the Canucks were eliminated by the Blackhawks in the second round. Following the Canucks' playoff elimination, he discussed his upcoming restricted free agency and commented on a desire to have more leeway with the coaches. On October 2, 2010 the Vancouver Canucks placed O'Brien on waivers.\nNashville Predators and Colorado Avalanche.\nThree days after being placed on waivers, O'Brien was traded to the Nashville Predators, along with Dan Gendur, for Ryan Parent and Jonas Andersson. While in Nashville he tied a career high in games played (80) adding two goals and seven assists during the 2010–11 season. He played in all of the Predators 12 playoff games but went unsigned by Nashville following the playoffs and became a free agent.\nOn July 13, 2011, he was signed to a one-year contract with the Colorado Avalanche. Acquired initially to provide depth insurance to the defense, O'Brien impressed out of training camp and made his Avalanche debut on the opening night of the 2011–12 season in a 3-0 defeat to the Detroit Red Wings. With his experience, physicality and leadership he quickly became a fixture on the defense of a youthful Avalanche team and appeared in his 400th career game in a 4-1 loss to the San Jose Sharks on November 20. With a more prominent role entrusted than given with former clubs, O'Brien matched a career high with 17 assists and finished with 20 points for his best statistical season since 2008. He also finished second amongst the Avalanche with 105 penalty minutes.\nWith the option of impending free agency again looming, O'Brien was re-signed by Colorado for $6 million over three years on June 26, 2012. Affected by the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, O'Brien was unable to emulate his previous year as he was relegated primarily as a depth defenseman to register only 4 assists in 28 games.\nCalgary Flames and Florida Panthers.\nOn June 27, 2013, O'Brien was traded by the Avalanche along with David Jones to the Calgary Flames in exchange for Alex Tanguay and Cory Sarich. On January 25, 2014, O'Brien was placed on waivers by the Flames. Unclaimed, O'Brien was assigned to affiliate, the Abbotsford Heat, marking a return to the AHL for the first time since 2006. On June 30, 2014, O'Brien was placed on unconditional waivers for purposes of a compliance buyout.\nAs a free agent O'Brien failed to attract significant interest and, on September 2, 2014, he accepted a professional try-out contract to the Florida Panthers training camp. On October 6, 2014, O'Brien was successful in earning a one-year, two-way contract with the Panthers.\nReturn to Anaheim and overseas.\nOn July 16, 2015, O'Brien signed as a free agent to a one-year, two-way contract in a return his original NHL club, the Anaheim Ducks. Unable to make the Ducks roster out of training camp, O'Brien added a veteran presence to AHL affiliate, the San Diego Gulls, for the duration of the 2015–16 season, posting 1 goal and 17 points in 57 games.\nWith his NHL opportunities exhausted, O'Brien remained a free agent over the summer and into the 2016–17 season. On January 10, 2017, O'Brien opted to sign his first contract abroad, agreeing to an initial two-week contract that would extend for the remainder of the season with Finnish club, HPK of the Liiga.\nMidway into the following 2017–18 season, O'Brien was signed to strengthen the blueline of Austrian club, EHC Black Wings Linz of the EBEL, on November 9, 2017.\nPersonal life.\nO'Brien was born in Port Hope, Ontario, and comes from a lineage of hockey players. His father, Pat O'Brien, played junior in Canada, while his uncle, Dennis O'Brien, had a 10-year career in the NHL, mostly with the Minnesota North Stars."

        "text": "Matt Mitchell (born 16 March 1957) is a retired American tennis player who played from 1974 to 1987. As a doubles pro, he was once the world's 30th-best. As an amateur, he won two NCAA championships and earned a place in two halls of fame.\nEarly life.\nMitchell, who was born in Berkeley, California, was the number one player in the last year of his age group from the 10s through the 16s. Mitchell holds four National Junior Titles: National Hardcourt Championships in Burlingame, California, in the 12-and-under Doubles with Jeff Robinson at the Peninsula Tennis Club; National Hardcourt Championships in Burlingame, California, in the 14-and-under Singles where he defeated Southern California's Perry Wright in the finals after upsetting Howard Schoenfield in the semifinals; National Hardcourt Championships in Burlingame, California at the Peninsula Tennis Club in the 16-and-under Singles, where he defeated Southern California's Walter Redondo; and, the National Hardcourt Championships in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the 16-and-under Doubles with Nial Brash.\nCareer.\nAmateur.\nIn 1974, Mitchell was recruited by Coach Dick Gould of Stanford University, where he signed his letter of intent in 1975. At Stanford University, he became a three-time All-American, where he achieved his first All-American honors when he beat the two-sport All-American John Lucas from the University of Maryland in the round of 32 at the NCAA Championships in Corpus Christi, Texas.\nIn 1977, Mitchell helped win the NCAA National Team Championships, where each team sent their best six singles players and best three doubles teams to compete in a single-elimination tournament. After Stanford University won the National Team Championships, Mitchell, seeded first in the singles event, beat John Bennett of Brigham Young University, John Austin of UCLA, Ben McKown of Trinity College, Bruce Nichols of UCLA, Chris Lewis of USC, and finally, Tony Graham of UCLA in a best-of-five set to win the NCAA Singles Championship.\nProfessional.\nIn 1979 Mitchell, in his first year as a professional player, was nominated as Rookie of the Year after he was ranked the second highest rookie, behind Vince Van Patten. Mitchell's greatest success in singles came at the Black and Decker Championships, in Melbourne, Australia in 1984, where he beat Eliot Teltscher who was eighth in the world, and Pat Cash who was tenth in the world to win the tournament. That single event catapulted Mitchell's ranking from 164 in the world to 63.\nMitchell's greatest success as a professional came as a doubles player, winning seven tournaments in doubles between 1980 and 1985. These included the 1984 ATP Player's Championships in Cincinnati, Ohio with Francisco Gonzalez, and, while partnering with Kevin Curren former All-American from University of Texas at Austin in 1986, they lost in the semifinals of the US Open Championships to Mats Wilander and Joakim Nyström of Sweden in a five-set match, 7–6 in the fifth. Mitchell's highest doubles ranking as a professional was 30 in the world.\nHonors.\nIn 1981, Mitchell was inducted into Stanford University Athletic Hall of Fame.\nIn 2006, Mitchell was inducted into the Intercollegiate Tennis Association's Men's Collegiate Tennis Hall of Fame."

It is the third game in the \"NBA Playoffs\" series of games.\nA three-card set was bundled with each copy of the game. Put together, the cards showed the entire roster against a sky background with the words, \"BARCELONA '92\" in red and white.\nGameplay.\nThe game could be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, \"Exhibition\" or \"Tournament\". Players could pick from one of the countries around the world to represent in the Olympics:\nIn the actual Olympic tournament, Croatia took the silver medal in the USA's closest match, with Lithuania taking bronze after being defeated by the US in the semi-finals.\nThe player can also use an All-World team, comprising the best players among the non-US squads, including Toni Kukoč, Bill Wennington, Andrew Gaze, Rik Smits, Sarunas Marciulionis and Vlade Divac.\nPuerto Rico, Brazil and Venezuela participated at the 1992 Summer Olympics' men's basketball tournament but do not appear in the game.

It was a result of the game being played in British India in the 1870s that led to the 3rd (East Kent) Regiment and the 62nd (Wiltshire) Regiment having a hand in the creation of the Calcutta Cup, the oldest international trophy. Many English rugby union clubs such as Leicester were also formed by soldiers.\nThe Army were represented in the very first international by two England players, Lieutenant Charles Arthur Crompton RE and Lieutenant Charles William Sherrard RE.\nShortly after the ARU was formed the RFU donated the Army Cup, which was to be competed for at inter-unit level. Over the years there have been some ferocious contests for cup and from those contests the reputation of the Army's great rugby units have been made. Those units include; the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, the Welch Regiment, the Royal Signals and 7 Regiment Royal Horse Artillery.\nThe highlight of the ARU season is the annual Army Navy Match held at Twickenham. The first of these matches took place in 1878 at the Kennington Oval, but it was not until 1907 that the match became an annual fixture as part of the Inter-Service Competition. In 1919, an Inter-Service Championship was arranged by the Army Rugby Union, which included Service teams from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, as well as a Royal Air Force team and a British Army team playing under the name \"Mother Country\". The Mother Country and New Zealand Army reached the final at Twickenham, with New Zealand winning the encounter to lift the King's Cup. In 1920 the Army–Navy competition was expanded to include the Royal Air Force, the same year that CSM C. W. Jones (Welch Regiment) was to become the first \"other rank\" to be picked to represent the army.\nBetween the wars (1920–39) the ARU arranged matches against the French Army, the last of which was played shortly before the Nazi German invasion of France in 1940. The period also saw Army players being selected for British Lions teams. In 1931 the Army Rugby Union Referees Society (ARURS) was formed and continues to provide professional refereeing for all games.\nAlthough the activities of the ARU were curtailed during the Second World War (1939–45), as they had been during the First World War (1914–18), a series of Service International matches were played around the country by teams drawn from rugby playing servicemen; these games drew large crowds and helped to maintain the nation's morale through the dark days of the war. An international team was formed shortly after the end of World War II, known as the British Empire Forces, who played a series of games against France. Although made up of internationals, with some from the professional code of rugby league, no caps were awarded to the Empire players in these matches, although the French Union recognised their players with caps.\nAfter the war first class rugby union players brought in through National Service dominated army rugby. During the period 1948–62 more men played for the Army XV than in any other previous or subsequent era. It meant that thirty Army players were selected to represent their countries and from among those selected; Matthews, Hall, Cameron, Scotland, Mike Campbell-Lamerton and Fisher were given the added privilege of captaining their respective national teams. Also on a national front the ARU can boast of the fact that it has had appointed from its ranks Presidents for the English and Scottish RFUs. They were: Major General BA Hill CB, DSO (English RFU 1937–39), Colonel BC Hartley CB, OBE (English RFU 1947–48), Major General RGS Hobbs CB, DSO, OBE (English RFU 1961–62), Brigadier FH Coutts CBE, DL (Scottish RFU 1977–78), Brigadier DW Shuttleworth OBE, ADC (English RFU 1985–86)\nA British Army Germany rugby union team regularly plays games against emerging nations like Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg. In the last few years the operational tempo of Army units on British Army Germany have seen these fixtures reduced.\nIn September 2011 the Army Senior XV travelled to Australia to participate in the first ever International Defence Rugby World Cup. Teams from the UK (Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and Army), the French Defence Force, the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces, Tonga, Samoa, China and Papua New Guinea all took part. The Army beat Samoa and the French Defence Force to progress to the semi-finals and were flown to Auckland New Zealand to play Tonga in the semi-final at North Shore RFC. Army scored in the 79th minute to win 15–10. The final was played at Auckland Uni RFC against the Australian Defence Force. The Army ran away winners 62–17 to become the first International Defence Rugby Union World Champions.\nThe United Kingdom hosted the second International Defence Rugby Competition in October 2015 coinciding with England holding the Rugby World Cup.\nWomen's rugby.\nIn 1996, the ARU officially recognised women's rugby union, which had been played in the army since the late 1980s. A women's inter-service competition was introduced in 2003 and since its inauguration the army teams have been its undisputed champions. In Nov 2010 LCpl Jane Leonard (Royal Engineers) won international honours with England Women playing and winning her first cap against New Zealand at Twickenham.\nIn 2010 the women's inter corps competition started with corps playing against each other. This has been a great incentive in the strengthening of the women's game in the Army. Over 200 women regularly play rugby in the inter corps competition.\nSevens.\nFor many years units have played rugby sevens, but there was no representative side. In 2000 that changed after Army XV players were used to help the England national team prepare for the IRB Sevens. The occasion gave rise to the creation of an Army Sevens team, which has become a significant force in the game, winning some of the sport's major competitions – including the Middlesex Sevens in 2001 and 2004. There are several Fijians in the side.\nCentenary year 2006/7.\nIn their centenary year (2006–07), the Army XV won the Inter-Services Competition, beating the RAF (54–10) and Royal Navy (39–25), for a record 6th successive time before they embarked on a tour of Australia and New Zealand, where they defeated teams fielded by the Australian Army (36–0) and the New Zealand Army (11–6).\nNotable former players.\nScotland internationalists.\nThe following former Army Rugby Union players have represented Scotland at full international level.\nWales internationalists.\nThe following former Army Rugby Union players have represented Wales at full international level.\nEngland internationalists.\nThe following former Army Rugby Union players have represented England at full international level.\nIreland internationalists.\nThe following former Army Rugby Union players have represented Ireland at full international level."

They reached eight semi-finals at the European Championship since 1995, including a third place in 2007 and runners-up in 2013 and 2017.\nHistory.\nHockey was introduced in Belgium in 1902. The country's first club was founded in 1904. In 1907, several clubs established the Belgian Hockey Association. Belgium played its first international match against Germany, and was one of the founding members of the International Hockey Federation (FIH).\nBetween 1920 and 1978, Belgium appeared in two of the first three World Cups and in eleven out of thirteen Summer Olympics. After the successful early years (before the 1950s) with three times being among the best five at the Summer Olympics, it would last six decades before Belgium reached the international field hockey top again from the 1990s on.\nBy the early 2000s, the Royal Belgian Hockey Association started to invest heavily in the youth and modernized its structures.

        "title": "Leicestershire &amp; Rutland Cricket Club",
        "text": "Cricket may not have reached the English counties of Leicestershire and Rutland until the 18th century. A notice in the \"Leicester Journal\" dated 17 August 1776 is the earliest known mention of cricket in the area. A few years later, a Leicestershire &amp; Rutland Cricket Club was taking part in important matches. Note that in some contemporary reports the club is called simply Leicester but the personnel involved are the same whichever title is used.\nMatches.\nThe \"Leicester Journal\" on 4 August 1781 reported Leicester v Melton Mowbray at Barrowcliffe Meadow near Leicester. Melton Mowbray won by 16 runs.\nLater the same season, the first reports have been found of a match between Leicester and Nottingham Cricket Club. These two old clubs forged quite a fierce rivalry. They met at Loughborough on 17 &amp; 18 September 1781 and the game was incomplete due to a dispute. Nottingham scored 50 &amp; 73; Leicester had scored 73 &amp; 9-2 when the game ended prematurely because of a dispute about wide deliveries. The repercussions dragged on and the dispute remained unresolved for some years.\nIn 1787, Leicester played matches against Coventry and Melton Mowbray. The Coventry game is extensively recorded in Buckley. Leicester lost by an innings to Melton Mowbray but defeated Coventry by 45 runs. In September 1788, they defeated Coventry by 28 runs in another match which Buckley records.\nIn 1789, Leicester played Nottingham again in two matches at Loughborough. They won one each and full scorecards have survived. It is evident that by this time these teams were representative of their counties and, in 1791, they were both deemed good enough to play against MCC, but they were both well beaten. This was hardly surprising as northern cricket was still developing while the southern teams had considerable match experience.\nLeicester's game against MCC was played at Burley-on-the-Hill in Rutland, which was the Earl of Winchilsea's country retreat, used as his base for foxhunting parties. It is not far from the Great North Road so communication with London was relatively easy at the time.\nIn 1792, Burley-on-the-Hill staged \"Leicestershire &amp; Rutland v Nottingham\", the home side winning by 4 wickets and providing a historical example of the fact that Leicestershire cricket encompasses Rutland.\nIn a further game at Leicester in 1800, Nottingham won by an innings and the old Leicestershire &amp; Rutland club seemed to fade away after that, apart from a couple of mentions in the early 19th century.\n19th century.\nLittle more is heard of Leicestershire cricket until the formation of the present club on 25 March 1879.\nLeicestershire County Cricket Club played its inaugural first-class match on 14, 15 &amp; 16 May 1894 versus Essex County Cricket Club at Leyton. It was the initial first-class match played by either club. In 1895, Leicestershire County Cricket Club joined the County Championship.\nFor the history of Leicestershire cricket since the foundation of the county club, see\" : Leicestershire County Cricket Club."

        "title": "Lane Field (baseball)",
        "text": "Lane Field was a baseball stadium located in San Diego, California. The ballpark was home to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League from 1936 through 1957.\nThe ballpark was located in downtown San Diego, at the end of West Broadway near the waterfront. Broadway bounded the park to the south (first base). Its other two close bounding streets were Harbor Drive (third base) and Pacific Highway (right field). There were various buildings to the north (left field) between the ballpark and Ash Street.\nHistory.\nBefore it was called Lane Field, the stadium began its life as a U.S. Navy athletic field in 1925. Two years later, football bleachers were added. The field also had a track, used for motorcycle and auto races. When Bill \"Hardpan\" Lane relocated his Hollywood Stars from the Los Angeles area in 1936, to become the San Diego Padres, he arranged for the Works Progress Administration to rebuild the venue as a baseball park. Although the WPA was known by the derisive nickname \"We Putter Around\", there was apparently no puttering in this project, as they finished the work in just two months time. It took the name Lane Field.\nThe new construction had a temporary look to it. The park had no roof, no lights, and not even a backstop. Its bleachers sat 8,000. The original entrance, a small Spanish-architecture structure, was retained for the ballpark, behind where the home plate area was established.\nAccording to a 2004 \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" article, the original field dimensions were 339 feet to the left field foul pole, 480 to the deepest part of center field, and 355 feet to right, a large rectangle. Along with the other remodeling, the dimensions were eventually reduced to a more normal size: 329 to left, 426 to center, 330 to right.\nThe first Padres game at Lane Field was played on March 31, 1936. The next year, a roof was added over the main part of the seating, and attendance improved. Attendance was boosted by a PCL pennant winning team and the attraction of budding young local star Ted Williams.\nOn October 7, 1945, three African-American players from the California Winter League's \"Kansas City Royals,\" one of them named Jackie Robinson, worked out at an empty Lane Field. \"Look\" magazine photographer Maurice Terrell surreptitiously photographed the action from the stands by agreement with Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey, who was planning to desegregate Major League Baseball and wanted illustrations for a planned exclusive feature article written by Arthur Mann. The article and photos would have highlighted Robinson and other stars from the Negro leagues, and was meant to accompany Rickey's announcement of signing them to the Dodgers. The article was never published in \"Look\", but a selection of the Lane Field photographs was published in the November 27, 1945, issue of \"Look\" to illustrate the signing of Robinson to the Montreal Royals.\nThe San Diego Padres would win another PCL pennant in 1954 at Lane Field. By then they had begun to look for a new facility. The wooden park, so near the waterfront in a presumably picturesque setting, was also constantly in need of repair and replacement of its boards, which tended to rot quickly in the sea air.\nAbandonment.\nLane Field was finally abandoned by the Padres following the 1957 PCL season. For 1958, the team shifted to the new Westgate Park, located in San Diego's Mission Valley area.\nThe site of Lane Field became Cruise Ship Parking, a parking lot between Pacific Highway and Harbor Drive which was used by cruise ship passengers. It is located approximately halfway between the Star of India and USS Midway museum ships. In 2015 it was dedicated as a city park. A plaque, which was placed in 2003 at the corner of Broadway and Pacific Highway to commemorate the ballpark, was moved in 2015 to the corner of Broadway and Harbor Drive."

        "text": "The Petone Rugby Football Club was founded in 1885 and has been the Wellington Premier Champion 39 times between 1895 and 2005. In addition, the club has won the Club Championship on 42 occasions between 1922 and 2005. Petone is a constituent club of the Wellington Rugby Football Union.\nLocation.\nThe Petone Club rooms are at the lower end of the Hutt Valley on a site in Udy Street. The Clubrooms stand immediately adjacent to North Park, a field maintained to the highest standards even though it is only used for training.\nOther Club facilities include:\nClub membership.\nClub membership in 2013 totalled more than 750, made up of life members, vice presidents, honorary members, open and age grade players and 412 young players in the junior section ranging from 4 and 5 year olds in the nursery grade to 12 year olds. The club fields nine teams in the Wellington Union's 2013 competition grades from Premier to Colts U21.\nThe club funds a coaching coordinator, Darren 'Lardy' Larsen. Lardy is a highly qualified and competent coach. He also runs the Konnect Blue programme that allows juniors leaving for college to stay in touch with the club until they return.\nReputation.\nThe club has produced 30 All Blacks and 16 NZ Maori representatives.\nTana Umaga became an All Black in 1997 and played continuously for his country before his retirement in 2006, becoming captain in 2004. Andy Leslie, a former NZ Rugby Union Vice President, was the club's first appointed All Black touring captain to Britain (1974) and South Africa (1976).\nHistory.\nPetone had a four-year reign as Premier Champions between 1904 and 1907 and the Club set a memorable record in the 1907 season when it won all championship grades in the Wellington competition. After the 1907 season the club was weakened by inadvertently helping the formation of rugby league in New Zealand. The club provided six players for the professional 1907-1908 rugby tour of Great Britain including its two All Blacks at the time, Tom Cross and Duncan McGregor, and the club's captain, Hercules Wright.\nThe New Zealand Rugby Union subsequently banned all members of the tour for life.\nIn the 1971 season the Premier team won the Premier competition and the Jubilee Cup for the fifth consecutive season and became the first club in the history of Wellington rugby to achieve this feat since the club competition was commenced in 1868. The first three wins in this sequence were achieved under the leadership of Ken Gray widely considered one of the greatest All Black prop forwards in the history of the game. The Ken Gray Academy was established in 1995 in Ken's name to assist in the development of the best young players wishing to find their way through the Club to the highest representative honours.\nThe centennial history records that Te Puni arrived in the Hutt Valley in 1817 and died there in 1870. In the first official match ever played by the Petone Club, three descendants of Te Puni were included in the fifteen. Today Petone Rugby is a multi-cultural mix in a family-oriented environment. The club always welcomes visitors to come and share its hospitality.\nIn November 2006, the club hosted The World Golden Oldies Festival and in 2010 the club celebrated its 125th anniversary.\nMonogram.\nThe club adopted its familiar monogram on the recommendation of its illustrious Life Member and Maori All Black, Matt Love, as part of its 50th jubilee celebrations in 1935. The monogram is embellished by the words in Maori \"kia kaha kia maia\" - broadly translated as \"give of your best - be confident in your own ability\". This reflects the strength of the partnership with Maori in the Club.\nThe monogram was updated in 2010 to include \"Est 1885\" and the words \"Petone Rugby Club\"."

It made its first international appearance in 1920 when a touring team visited England, coached by Constance M.K. Applebee. The team made several international appearances in the early 20th century, leading to the United States hosting the eighth International Federation of Women's Hockey Associations Tournament in 1963. Once the IFWHA merged with its counterpart on the men's side, the United States' first appearance at an FIH-sanctioned tournament was the 1983 Women's Hockey World Cup in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where the Americans ended up in sixth place. They have won bronze at the Los Angeles 1984 Summer Olympics and bronze at the 1994 World Cup.\nOlympics.\nLos Angeles 1984 Olympics.\nDuring the 1984 Summer Olympics, the team won their first international prize, a bronze medal. This happened after the Netherlands defeated Australia (2–0) in the final match of the round-robin tournament and Australia and the United States were left tied for third place with identical records: two wins, two losses, one draw, and nine goals scored and seven goals conceded. Following the Holland-Australia match, the United States players came down from the stands and competed with the Australians in a penalty shoot-out to decide the bronze medal. The US won the shootout (10–5) to claim America's first Olympic medal in women's field hockey.\nBeijing 2008 Olympics.\nThe Olympic qualifying squad placed first in the second series of games during the 2008 Women's Hockey Olympic Qualifier. At the Olympics, the team finished fourth in pool B and lost the seventh/eight place play-off to Germany 2–4, finishing in eighth place.\nLondon 2012 Olympics.\nThe USWNT qualified for the London 2012 Summer Olympics after defeating Argentina 4–2 at the Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico. The U.S. had high hopes of finishing their rocky 2012 Olympic campaign on a high note. Unfortunately, that did not happen for Team USA as the final match at Riverbank Arena in London's Olympic Park ended with a disappointing 2–1 loss to Belgium, leaving the U.S. with a last place finish in the tournament.\nRio 2016 Olympics.\nIn similar fashion to qualifying for the London 2012 Olympics, the USWNT defeated Argentina at the Pan American Games in Toronto, Canada to punch their ticket to the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics. In pool play the USWNT toppled both global hockey powerhouses Argentina (2nd FIH World Ranked) and Australia (3rd FIH World Ranked) with the same score of 2–1. Continuing in their preliminary schedule, the US pushed past Japan (6–1) and India (3–0). The match in quarter-final play with Great Britain blemished the undefeated record of USWNT and resulted in a loss, 2–1. They placed fifth.\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following 18 players represented the United States in the FIH Pro League match against Great Britain in London, Great Britain.\nHead coach: David Passmore\nThe following players make up the remainder of the national squad:"

He was an All-American at Duke University and in 1959 won the Outland Trophy, given to the nation's best interior lineman. After playing for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1960 to 1962, he returned as an assistant coach to Duke, and then at the University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin–Madison, before becoming head coach at East Carolina University (1970) and Duke (1971–1978). At East Carolina, he compiled a 3–8 record, and at Duke he compiled a 37–47–4 record. His overall record as a head coach was 40–55–4. His best seasons came in 1971 and 1974, when he went 6–5. He later became athletic director at the University of Cincinnati (1980–1984), the University of Southern California (1984–1993), and the University of South Carolina (1993–2005).

        "title": "Junior tennis",
        "text": "Junior tennis refers to tennis matches where the participants are aged 18 and under. Eligibility to compete in International Tennis Federation Junior tournaments is not based on age, but year of birth: as a result, some players must move out of juniors soon after their 18th birthday, while others can play juniors until they are nearly 19. Some players who qualify as \"junior tennis\" players also play in main adult tours, though forms signed by their parent or guardian are required for this. Historically, some junior players will turn professional at the age of 16 like Andre Agassi or Pete Sampras.\nUnited States Tennis Association (USTA) Junior Tournaments.\nThe USTA runs their own circuit of junior tournaments at sorted into different age groups. With initial junior tournaments being organized in the 1910s, the USTA now runs a yearly circuit of tournaments ranging from district level up to national and international events. The USTA offers tournaments for divisions as young as 8 and under, up to 18 and under. For the younger divisions, smaller courts and shortened matches are used, transitioning into full best of three sets matches at the older age divisions. Many participants in the USTA junior circuit go on to play tennis in college, either at the collegiate level, or through the USTA Tennis on Campus. Until recently, each region of the USTA operated under slightly different formats, rules and regulations. But as of 2021, the USTA has standardized their ranking system and tournaments system under a single set of guidelines.\nEligibility.\nTo play a USTA sanctioned tournament, a junior must be a registered USTA member and a US citizen. Some non-US citizens are also allowed to compete, such as those living in the US for asylum or with refugee status, or children of diplomats. In addition, a player is allowed to compete in an age division until the month of their birthday in which they age-out (such as turning 17 and no longer being 16 and under). Players often compete in multiple divisions, playing above their age in addition to their current age division. All USTA members are divided by location into sections, with some junior tournaments restricting entry only to players in the section they are held.\nTournaments.\nThe USTA separates their junior tournaments into 7 levels, with the highest leveled tournaments being Level 1, and then descending in ranking points available and prestige until Level 7. Level 1 and Level 2 tournaments are exclusively run at the national level (some notable tournaments include the USTA National Championships, which funnels into the Junior US Open and US Open for the 16s and 18s divisions respectively). Level 3 tournaments are run both at the national, and the sectional level, where some sections can run \"Closed Section Level 3 Tournaments\", where they restrict entry to be exclusively players from that section. Each USTA section hosts an annual Sectionals Championship, a Level 3 tournament that provides the winner direct entry into the USTA National Championships at the corresponding age level. All tournaments below Level 3 are hosted at the sectional or district level, and usually provide fewer points. These tournaments can vary between being closed section or open to any USTA junior, which is decided by the section running them. Each tournament level has its own formatting rules and draw sizes, but most matches played are best two out of three sets, with either a full third set or a tiebreak played in lieu of a third set. The larger tournaments are often 64 or 128 players per draw, while smaller tournaments can have as few as 2 or 4 players.\nRanking.\nPlayers are accepted into tournaments based on their USTA ranking. Before 2021, rankings were calculated at both the sectional and the national level, with different point tallies for the different categories. However, the USTA has since standardized their ranking system, removing the sectional ranking systems, leaving only the national rankings. A player's singles ranking is calculated by summing the points received from their best 6 singles results in the last 12 months, as well as 15% of the points received for their 6 best doubles results. The USTA posts summarized rankings multiple times a year, but uses a weekly standings list to determine entry into tournaments. They also provide point rewards for certain international tournaments, such as the Junior Grand Slams.\nTop ranked USTA juniors often go on to professional play, or top ranked Division I college programs. Recent notable former USTA junior players include Francis Tiafoe, John Isner, Sloane Stephens and Madison Keys.\nThe ITF junior tour.\nThe International Tennis Federation conducts the ITF Junior Circuit, which allows juniors to establish a world junior ranking and give them a chance to get an ATP or WTA ranking. Most juniors who enter the international circuit have to do so by progressing through ITF tournaments, Satellites, Futures and Challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit, the latter three of which are also participated in by adults. However, some juniors, such as Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Frenchman Gaël Monfils, have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the ATP tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments.\nTournament grades.\nTournaments are divided into 8 different grades. The following list presents them in descending order of importance towards the junior ranking.\nRankings.\nIn 2004, the ITF implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles, by combining two rankings (singles and doubles) into one combined tally. Junior tournaments do not offer prize money. Juniors may earn income through tennis by participating on the Futures, Satellites or Challenger tours. Tournaments are broken up into different tiers offering different amounts of ranking points, culminating with Grade A and the junior Grand Slams - the most prestigious junior events. Worldwide, many junior players also have a Universal Tennis Rating.\nGrand Slam and Grade A tournaments.\nThe grand slam tournaments are the same for juniors as they are for the professional seniors, the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. In addition, there are five other prestigious junior tournaments, given Grade A status by the ITF. They are, in calendar order, the Abierto Juvenil Mexicano, Copa Gerdau, Trofeo Bonfiglio, Osaka Mayor's Cup, and the Orange Bowl.\nInternational team tournaments.\nThe ITF has developed international junior tournaments; the boys tournament is named the \"Junior Davis Cup by BNP Paribas\", and the tournament for girls is named the \"Junior Fed Cup\"."

        "title": "History of surfing",
        "text": "The riding of waves has likely existed since humans began swimming in the ocean. In this sense, bodysurfing is the oldest type of wave-catching. Undoubtedly ancient sailors learned how to ride wave energy on many styles of early boats. Archaeological evidence even suggests that ancient cultures of Peru surfed on reed watercraft for fishing and recreation up to five thousand years ago. However, standing up on what is now called a surfboard is a relatively recent innovation developed by the Polynesians. The influences for modern surfing can be directly traced to the surfers of pre-contact Hawaii.\nPeru.\nArchaeologists have found that the practice of riding a vessel with a wave was utilized since the pre-Inca cultures around three to five thousand years ago. The Moche culture used the caballito de totora (little horse of totora), with archaeological evidence showing its use around 200 CE.\nAn early description of the Inca surfing was documented by Jesuit missionary José de Acosta in his 1590 publication \"Historia natural y moral de las Indias\", writing:\nTo this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.\nWest Africa.\nWest Africans (e.g., Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Senegal) and western Central Africans (e.g., Cameroon) independently developed the skill of surfing. Amid the 1640s CE, Michael Hemmersam provided an account of surfing in the Gold Coast: “the parents ‘tie their children to boards and throw them into the water.’” In 1679 CE, Barbot provided an account of surfing among Elmina children in Ghana: “children at Elmina learned “to swim, on bits of boards, or small bundles of rushes, fasten’d under their stomachs, which is a good diversion to the spectators.” James Alexander provided an account of surfing in Accra, Ghana in 1834 CE: “From the beach, meanwhile, might be seen boys swimming into the sea, with light boards under their stomachs. They waited for a surf; and came rolling like a cloud on top of it. But I was told that sharks occasionally dart in behind the rocks and ‘yam’ them.” Thomas Hutchinson provided an account of surfing in southern Cameroon in 1861: “Fishermen rode small dugouts ‘no more than six feet in length, fourteen to sixteen inches in width, and from four to six inches in depth.’”\nPolynesia.\nThe art of surfing, known as \"hee nalu\" (literally, wave sliding) in the Hawaiian language, was recorded in his journal by Joseph Banks aboard during the first voyage of James Cook, during the ship's stay in Tahiti in 1769:...their cheif [sic] amusement was carried on by the stern of an old canoe, with this before them they swam out as far as the outermost breach, then one or two would get into it and opposing the blunt end to the breaking wave were hurried in with incredible swiftness. Sometimes they were carried almost ashore...\nSurfing was a central part of ancient Polynesian culture and predates European contact. The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.\nIn Tahiti and Samoa, surfing was a popular pastime that was often used as part of warriors' training. Warriors often paddled to surf breaks and were recorded in print by early European historians as spending many hours bravely paddling head-on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied surfing parties and the men would often swap between canoeing and paddling boards, and then catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i, surfing became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.\nThe sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed Samoans surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as \"fa'ase'e\" or \"se'egalu.\" Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in Tonga, where the late king Taufa'ahau Tupou IV became an expert surfer in his youth. Matt Warshaw, however, says the King began to surf in the 1960s on a board given him by Duke Kahanamoku.\nAncient Hawaii.\nHawaiians referred to this art as \"hee nalu\" which translates into English as \"wave sliding.\" The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the \"kahuna\" (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.\nHawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the \"koa\" (\"Acacia koa\"), \"ulu\" (\"Artocarpus altilis\"), and \"wiliwili\" (\"Erythrina sandwicensis\") trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the \"olo\", \"kikoo\", and the \"alaia\". The \"olo\" is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The \"kikoo\" ranges in length from and requires great skill to maneuver. The \"alaia\" board is around long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were often of the upper class including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper-class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.\nSome ancient sites still popular today include Kahaluu Bay and Holualoa Bay.\nPost-contact Hawaii.\nAfter contact with the Western World Hawaiian culture was forced to change. While Europeans were preoccupied with exploring and later colonizing the Pacific, they defined the islands as specks of land in a faraway sea. Western diseases spread and colonization began, plantations were built, and immigration started. Local Hawaiians, mixed with imported workers from Asia, were put to work on sugar plantations and Protestant missionaries attempted to turn the population from their traditional beliefs into Christians. Along with the suppression of traditional culture was the suppression of surfing, often viewed as frivolous.\nIt was not until Waikiki became a tourist destination that surfing began a resurgence in popularity. Particularly wealthy Americans came to the beach and saw the locals occasionally surfing what had long been an established surf break, Waikiki, and wanted to try it. Mark Twain attempted it but failed in 1866. Jack London tried it while visiting, then chronicled it enthusiastically in an essay entitled \"A Royal Sport\" published in October 1907. In 1908 Alexander Hume Ford founded the Outrigger Canoe and Surfing Club the first modern organization developed to promote surfing broadly, although it was de facto whites-only and women weren't admitted until 1926. Local Hawaiians started their own club in 1911 called Hui Nalu, meaning \"Club of the Waves\". But the first surf icons who gained widespread recognition, George Freeth and Duke Kahanamoku, became famous for practicing their traditional sport and helped spread it from Waikiki to around the world.\nAs the news of this new sport began to spread, locals in Waikiki began giving lessons and demonstrations for tourists. This was the basis of the Waikiki Beach Boys, a loose group of mostly native Hawaiians who hung out at the beach, surfed daily, and taught wealthy haole tourists how to ride waves. This was also known as the Hawaiian boarder-land, where white hegemony was uncertain and Natives inverted dominant social categories. A borderland is a place where differences converge and social norms are often fluid. Because state-sanctioned authority is often absent from the borderlands, unique social and cultural identities are formed there. This was the foundation of a continual element of surf culture, repeated around the globe innumerable times and continuing to this day: people who, for at least a time, dedicate most of their daily lives to living on or around the beach and surfing as much as they can. These groups in Hawaii, and following in Australia, California, laid the foundation for modern surf culture around the world.\nNorth America.\nIn July 1885, four teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, David Kawananakoa, Edward Keliiahonui, Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana'ole, and Elle Mancini surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn.\nIn 1907 George Freeth was brought to California from Hawaii, to demonstrate surfboard riding as a publicity stunt to promote the opening of the Los Angeles-Redondo-Huntington railroad owned by Henry Huntington, who gave his name to Huntington Beach. Freeth surfed at the Huntington Beach pier and travelled up and down the coast demonstrating surfing and lifeguard skills.\nSurfing on the East Coast of the United States began in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina in 1909 when Burke Haywood Bridgers and a colony of surfers introduced surfing to the East Coast. The State of North Carolina honored Burke Haywood Bridgers and the colony of surfers by placing a North Carolina Highway Marker for PIONEER EAST COAST SURFING on Wrightsville Beach and designated Wrightsville Beach as the birthplace of surfing in North Carolina in 2015. North Carolina has the greater weight of published verifiable accurate evidence and impacts a broader geographical area when compared to other east coast states. Burke Haywood Bridgers and the colony of surfers activities are among the earliest appearances of surfboards in the Atlantic Ocean. The early twentieth-century surfers proved that surfing migrated from Hawaii to California and North Carolina about the same time, then Florida.\nThe Wrightsville Beach Museum Waterman Hall of Fame honors, recognizes, and inducts community members for their contributions to the island's watersport culture.\nSurf Culture Epicenters.\nFor over a century now intrepid North American surfers have explored and ridden innumerable rugged and unnamed waves all over the vast North American coastline, yet distinct surf cultures tend to form around special small areas of particularly consistent good surf. The most archetypal and original of these is Malibu (both before and after Gidget). Not only is Malibu a rare world-class wave, but being adjacent to Hollywood it became the stereotype of Southern Californian surfing culture for the rest of the United States and the world. As Waikiki represented Hawaii, so Malibu represented California in the popular mindset. Both wave's quality remains intact to this day, but their local culture has gone through many shifts. Great surf epicenters often find their original surf culture quickly overrun by outside popularity, sometimes repeatedly.\nGenerally there are nine broadly defined continental regions, based on similar conditions: Alaskan, Cascadian, Northern California, Southern California, the Great Lakes, the Gulf Coast, East Coast of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, the North East, and Puerto Rico. Usually Hawaii is considered a separate entity from North America, subdivided by island and region. In professional surfing US mainlanders often use the American flag whereas Hawaiians (of any race) use the Hawaiian state flag.\nAustralian surfing.\nIn 1910, Tommy Walker returned to Manly Beach, Sydney, with a surfboard \"bought at Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, for two dollars.\" Walker became an expert rider and in 1912 gave several exhibitions in Sydney.\nSurfboard riding received national exposure with the exhibitions by Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku in the summer of 1914-1915 at several Sydney beaches. As a current Olympic sprint champion, Kahanamoku was invited to tour the Eastern states for an extensive series of swimming carnivals and at his first appearance in the Domain Pool, Sydney, smashed his previous world record for 100 yards by a full second.\nFollowing the first exhibition at Freshwater on 24 December 1914, in the New Year Kahanamoku demonstrated his skill at Freshwater and Manly, followed by appearances at Dee Why and Cronulla.\nDuke Kahanamoku's board is now on display in the Freshwater Surf Life Saving Club, Sydney, Australia.\nGreat Britain.\nIn 1890, the pioneer in agricultural education John Wrightson reputedly became the first British surfer at Bridlington in Yorkshire when instructed by two Hawaiian students, Princes David Kahalepouli Kawanaankoa Piikoi and Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole Pikkoi, studying at his college.\nModern surfing.\nAround the start of the 20th century, Hawaiians living close to Waikiki began to revive surfing, and soon re-established surfing as a sport. The revival is linked to real estate development and efforts to boost tourism. The beach was historically a place where haole and Hawaiian worlds collided and violence was sometimes a substitute for mutual understanding. Duke Kahanamoku, \"Ambassador of Aloha,\" Olympic medalist, and avid waterman, helped expose surfing to the world. Kahanamoku's role was later memorialized by a 2002 first class letter rate postage stamp of the United States Postal Service. Author Jack London wrote about the sport after having attempted surfing on his visit to the islands. Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever-increasing public exposure.\nSurfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: Hawaii, Australia, and California, although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film Gidget, based on the life of surfer Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman, boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an underground culture into a national fad and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. B-movies and surf music such as the Beach Boys and Surfaris based on surfing and Southern California beach culture (Beach Party films) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers. This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\".\nThe anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album \"Surfin' Safari\", the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:\"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of \"surfing\" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb).\"\nRegardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the short board in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by Kelly Slater, the \"Michael Jordan of Surfing\"). In 1975, professional contests started. That year Margo Oberg became the first female professional surfer.\nSurfing documentaries have been one of the main ways in which surfing culture grows and replenishes itself, not just as a sport but as an art form, the style and quality of surf films have often tracked well the evolution of the sport.\nProfessional surfing.\nDefining the scope of professional surfing is difficult, because like in many extreme sports, there is more than one model for what constitutes a professional. There are three main contemporary modes of making money purely as an active surfer: sponsorship, surf contests, and social media influence. Most often all three go together, but sometimes well-known professionals excel in only one.\nIf a professional surfer is someone who makes money from surfing (not including teaching), then the history of professional surfing dates to perhaps 1959 when the first West Coast Surfing Championships was held in Huntington Beach, California. Previously there had been innumerable amateur competitions, from the ancient Hawaiians themselves who were known to wager on the outcomes, to multiple iterations of surf competition as some form of race (commonly starting from shore, paddling to a buoy, then catching a wave back to shore).\nIn 1961 the United States Surfing Association (USSA) was founded, arguably the first proto-professional surfing contest organization. This was also about the time when surfing switched from core action: simply riding a quality wave, to a more style-oriented endeavor where turns, tricks, style, and artistry began to be important. Dynamic moves, such as nose-riding, top turns, and cut-backs were becoming even more important than catching the best wave and riding it for the longest possible time, which had previously been the primary goal, and seemed self-evident to earlier surfers.\nThrough numerous iterations of the surf contest and small sponsorships, very few people ever made a living from surfing alone (by not teaching or producing signature model boards or clothing) until the 1970s. As described in the documentary Bustin' Down the Door much of the prestige and money to be made from contest surfing resided in Hawaii, specifically, the increasingly important epicenter of worldwide performance-surfing: the North Shore of Oahu. But when Australians and South Africans showed up to join the Californians who had been migrating there in waves for nearly 20 years, multiple tensions arose between not only the Americans vs international surfers, but even more powerfully between the local Hawaiians and the haoles generally.\nInto the 1980s surfing saw its second boost of wider popular recognition (the first being from Gidget) with new neon colors, increasing shortboard performance, more professional surfers, and a number of surf brands becoming trendy beyond surfing, such as Town &amp; Country Surf Designs and Body Glove. The pro surfers of the 1980s were able to make more money, get more exposure, and generally survive longer with no job other than contest surfing and sponsorship.\nIn the last few decades there are generally less than 60 men and 30 women who qualify for the highest level of the surf league each year in its modern form, the WSL. There are thousands more surfers competing in various smaller surf contests held continually around the world, the majority of them being for groms (young participants). In the last half century of competitive surfing, nearly all professionals have learned to surf as children and were essentially prodigies, as in most modern professional sports.\nIn 1920, Duke Kahanamoku, the \"Father of Modern Surfing\", proposed that the sport be included in the Olympics. Surfing was to be a part of the Olympics for the first time ever in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, allowing athletes from around the world to show their skills in the sport. Before surfing could make its Olympic debut, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games to be cancelled and then rescheduled for the year 2021. Surfing is set to appear in the 2021 Olympics with several members of the WSL as well as other amateur surfers for the first time ever at Tsurigasaki Beach in Chiba Japan.\nTechnological innovations in surfing.\nSurfing has been an internationally co-developed sport since its early spread beyond Hawaii, and has been highly influenced by (and generally welcoming of) new technology. There are no standards or committees to rule surfboard design or progression. Change has been rampant. Surfers generally pick styles and materials based on performance, feeling, and price. Surfboard shapers can be global name-brand professionals, local artisans, or even backyard amateurs. Unlike many other sports, the high variability and subtle performance differences in the main apparatus, the surfboard, is fundamental to both the experience and history. While many other sports standardize their equipment, in surfing, diversity in craft-design played a huge part in its history and still ongoing culture.\nMuch of the last century of surf history has been defined by new eras of technology which often fundamentally changed the experience. Surfers themselves have often developed, altered, or anticipated new technology to grant increased access to previously unsurfed waves and places. And unlike many other sports, the secondary equipment became almost as important as the core surfboard, a prime example being the wetsuit. The worldwide history of surfing could easily be divided between pre-wetsuit and post-wetsuit, because it expanded the potential to surf places previously far too cold, which comprised a vast amount of un-surfed worldwide coastline. On a similar basis, surfing history could justifiably be divided between pre-polystyrene and post-polystyrene surfboards, or pre-fin and post-fin as the original Hawaiian boards did not have fins until Tom Blake added one in 1935. Technology has changed surfing repeatedly and dramatically throughout its modern development, generally making the sport more accessible, cheaper, easier, and raising the level of performance.\nMuch of this change has also come from the fact that surfing was originally, and for many decades into the modern era, primarily a tropical or summertime only warm water sport, and a developed-world sport, making its early range quite limited. But after the arrival of mass-produced fiberglass boards, quality wetsuits, offroad vehicles, and inexpensive international travel, surfing became accessible along many parts of the world's coasts which were previously unthinkable or unknown as surf spots. Travelers thereby introduced the sport and equipment to the local coastal peoples of even very remote places. By the 21st century, much of the worldwide coastline has been explored and local peoples surf in nearly every country with access to waves. Yet unlike many other aspects of human expansion, there remain surf breaks as yet never ridden by humans, often in remote or treacherous corners of the globe, politically unstable areas, or around uninhabited islands, many which might yet reveal great surf spots in the future.\nThe Short Board Revolution.\nThe ancient Hawaiians had mainly three types of board: Olo, Alaia, and Paipo. The Olo was 4.5 to 6.096 meters (15 to 20 ft) long and solid wood. They were very difficult to make and reserved for the upper classes. The Alai was only 1.82 or 2.13 meters (6 or 7 ft) long and usually much thinner. The Paipo was even smaller and similar to a modern bodyboard. None of these had a fin.\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century nearly all modern surfboards were longboards, generally 2.74 meters (9 ft) or longer, although after the 1930s they began to shift away from being solid dense wood and towards lighter materials like balsa wood, and eventually various forms of polystyrene, which still dominate to this day.\nThroughout the decades, shapers had occasionally made smaller boards, often as novelties, experiments, or specifically designed for small-statured people, but the popularity of those designs was slow to rise. During the surfboard production boom of the 1960s, the predominantly male shapers would sometimes construct specifically smaller boards for girls (who are often lighter and shorter, affecting weight/length requirements for paddling). Yet often they ended up surfing those small boards themselves because the style of surfing was different and mid-wave turns were growing in popularity, more easily done on shorter boards.\nA fundamental reason for longer, thicker, more buoyant surfboards generally is they paddle faster, and paddle-speed is crucial to wave catching. But in the 1960s faster waves were becoming more popular, waves with narrower take off zones, requiring more skill to drop in. If the surfer could catch a fast wave, then a shorter board was inherently more maneuverable (and by extension more fun).\nBy the early 1970s, shorter boards began to rise dramatically in popularity, not just as novelties but as fulltime craft, so design innovation was not far behind. The number of fins and their location was experimented with. Various nose and tail shapes were tried. Then, by the 1980s, the styles were refined and coalescing into the modern shortboard just as the second large burst of broader surf-culture popularity within the mainstream was occurring. The 3-fin, 1.82 meters (6-ft-tall)\"thruster\" shortboard began to take over as the most popular design. A generally narrow board with rather small variance in design was being mass-produced. It nearly always has three fins, a pointed nose, a squash tail, and was approximately the height of the rider.\nThis basic style of board, with many small modifications, has been the dominant craft since the 1980s and is still the approximation of the modern professional surfboard. In 21st century professional surfing the common boards have slowly become shorter and wider, with a more rounded nose and sometimes 4-fins (very rarely 2-fins and never 1-fin), although non-professionals still regularly mix and match all those options based on personal taste.\nBig wave surfing.\nAlthough the original Hawaiian surfers would ride large unbreaking ocean swells on their Olo boards, surfing a breaking wave larger than 4.5 to 6.1 meters (15–20 ft) was extremely challenging with pre-modern equipment, if it was attempted at all. But once board design began advancing rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s these larger and faster waves became more accessible. The first truly renowned big wave spot was Oahu's Waimea Bay. As the North Shore of Oahu was being explored for all its various breaks, Waimea was seen as too fast, brutal, and difficult. As detailed in the movie Riding Giants the first documented successful attempt was in October 1957. Once Waimea was finally surfed, it spawned the search for other giant waves around the world, and a devotional subset of surfers who specifically desired to surf very large waves. By the 1990s there were numerous giant waves being surfed all over the world, some regularly reaching the 12.2, 15.2, even 18.3 meters (40-, 50-, 60-ft) range. Big wave surfing bifurcated into two main branches: paddle-in and tow-in. Some waves are so big and quick it is nearly impossible to paddle fast enough to catch them, so surfers started towing behind boats and PWCs in order to catch the wave.\nStyle versus performance.\n\"What is the purpose of surfing?\" has long been philosophically debated in and out of surf culture. Often the entire endeavor has been viewed in the popular media as a waste of time, or the occupation of slackers. For the most part, surfing is agreed to be purely recreational, as it did not develop from, or turn into, a useful mode of daily transportation (as opposed to skiing or skateboarding, which can be both). Therefore in judging and appreciating surfing there has always been varying opinions about what is necessary, stylish, extravagant, and/or functional.\nThe variety and size of waves varies tremendously, as does surf craft, and to some degree even the medium. Harnessing the momentum of a wave for travel is the loosest definition of surfing, so in popular culture, the term is often applied to many forms of expanded \"surfing\". Particularly \"surfing the web\" and \"couch surfing\" common examples. But also characters like The Silver Surfer have taken the notion of surfing into science fiction.\nThere are also those who view surfing in a religious context. Certainly for the ancient Hawaiians, this component was important because the ocean was viewed as a deity. Yet also in modern surfing it is common for surfing to refer to it as some form of church or mass.\nSurfing's impact on popular culture.\nComparatively small and localized surfing cultures have repeatedly generated surprisingly large influence upon popular culture, particularly in the United States of America and Australia, as well as upon the global consciousness of surfing as a form of recreation. Since the expansion of surfing in the mid-20th century, there have been numerous coastal towns that were situated near good surf breaks, whose citizens did not yet know about modern surfing, and so did not even realize it was a rare commodity.\nIn America and Australia, the culture of surfing has influenced popular culture in periodic fads, starting with novels, movies, and the early-1960s TV show, \"Gidget\". \"Gidget\" is often given credit for popularizing surfing as a \"slightly strange and hedonistic lifestyle\". In film specifically, the surfing image has been so popular that it inspired an entire “beach party/surf film genre”. The attention that surfing has received in popular culture has waxed and waned, much like other niche sports.\nAnother area of popular culture where surfing has had significant influence is popular music. As many scholars recognize, a large part of surfing’s popularity is from the positively connoted image of “beach parties, rich tans, loose clothing, and surf-ready cars\"; in other words, there is \"more to surfing than the sea”. This image is very well suited to be represented in popular music, which is why so many popular teen anthems are based on the surfing craze. The Beach Boys, a group whose songs frequently involved “an endless summer filled with surfing, cruising, and beachcombing,” is only one such example. In the first half of the 1960s especially, popular music was dominated by exuberant music featuring the surf craze (\"surf rock\"). Another example is Katy Perry’s Billboard #1 hit song “California Gurls,” featuring Snoop Dogg released in 2010, which highlights the same beachside lifestyle first popularized in the 1960s.\nFashions developed within surf culture have had a large worldwide impact numerous times from the 1960s to the present. A number of large clothing brands began as surfing brands, including but not limited to: OP, Stussy, Billabong, Quicksilver, Roxy, Hurley, O'Neill, Ripcurl, RVCA, Vans, Volcom, Reef, and Da Kine. One of the largest influences is probably the worldwide adoption of boardshorts as swim gear for men.\nAlternatives to wind-generated waves.\nSince their invention, surfers have sometimes used wave pools to attempt surfing, but generally, the waves were too small and not well-formed enough for an enjoyable experience. The 1987 movie North Shore started the protagonist in an Arizona wave pool, then going on to Hawaii to try his luck. Both in and out of the movie this was considered basically a joke. But more recently, multiple attempts have been made to construct wave pools specifically designed for surfing. there are only a few around the world open to the public, but there are numerous in development. 2018 was the first year a professional surfing contest was held at a wave pool, specifically: \"Kelly Slater's Surf Ranch\".\nWakeboarding is a popular type of surfing done behind a boat's wake. There are also sometimes standing waves in rivers at high flow which can be surfable. At certain times of year on large rivers, tidal bores are surfable. People have also surfed alongside large cargo ships as their wakes roll into shallower water, and a few people have even surfed the waves caused by calving glaciers.\nThe Wave Bristol opened in The UK as an inland artificial surf site."

He became the first player to desert his existing contract to jump over to the Union Association. He is one of the few pitchers in Major League history to throw two no-hitters.\nCareer.\nAtkinson was born in Clinton, Illinois, and he began his Major League career with the Philadelphia Athletics in , pitching in 22 games, winning 11 and losing 11. Later in the season, Al jumped to the new Union Association, remaining there until season's end. With that move, Al became the first player to desert his existing contract and join the Union Association. He played for two teams during his time in the Union Association, a league that folded following the season. He began play with the Chicago Browns and later played for the Baltimore Monumentals and had a combined record of 20 wins and 26 losses during the 1884 season. On May 24, 1884, he pitched his first no-hitter. He tossed his gem against the Pittsburgh Alleghenys in a 10–1 victory. This no-hitter is also notable for the fact that Al allowed the first batter of the game on base with a hit by pitch and then retired the next 27 batters in a row. The only run scored when Ed Swartwood, the player hit by the pitch, stole second base‚ took third base on a putout‚ and then scored on a passed ball.\nHe played for an independent minor league team, the Chicago Blues, during the season, but returned the Athletics for the season. He pitched his second no-hitter on May 1, 1886, against the New York Metropolitans in a 3–2 victory.\nPost-career.\nAfter his career, he became a farmer. Al died at the age of 91 in McDonald County, Missouri, and is interred at the Macedonia Cemetery in Stella, Missouri."

In 1969, Brewer, playing center, led his team to the first of four state championships. Brewer was followed at Proviso East by other future NBA players, notably Doc Rivers, Michael Finley, Dee Brown, Shannon Brown, Sterling Brown, and JeVon Carter.\nThe 6'9\" 210-pound forward then attended the University of Minnesota. One of his teammates was future Baseball Hall-of-Famer Dave Winfield. He is infamous for his role in a 1972 brawl in Minneapolis, where white Ohio State center Luke Witte was assaulted by fellow Gophers Corky Taylor and Ron Behagen in a game. The fight escalated when Brewer repeatedly struck Witte's white teammate Dave Merchant in the face.\nBrewer played in the 1972 Summer Olympics, including the United States' controversial loss to the Soviet Union in the gold medal game, being violently injured by Alexander Belov during the free-throw in the second half and unable to continue playing. The referees failed to properly assess the flagrant foul. After the Olympics, Brewer was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round (2nd pick) of the 1973 NBA draft.\nWhenever Brewer scored a basket at a Cavaliers home game, the public address announcer would declare, \"Two for the Brew!\" Brewer played nine seasons in the NBA from 1973 to 1982.

        "text": "The 33rd Ryder Cup, also known as the \"Battle of Brookline\", was held September 24–26, 1999, in the United States at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb southwest of Boston.\nThe American team won the competition by a margin of 14 to 13, The Europeans, leading 10–6 heading into the final round, needed only 4 points on the final day to retain the cup. The Americans rallied on the Sunday, winning the first 6 matches of the day to surge into the lead. Further wins by Steve Pate and Jim Furyk took them into a 14–12 lead. The Americans recaptured the Ryder Cup when Justin Leonard halved his match with José María Olazábal. With the match all-square Leonard holed a 45-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole. After controversial premature celebrations on the green, Olazabal then missed his 22-foot birdie putt to leave Leonard one up with just one hole to play, assuring him of a half point and guaranteeing an American victory.\nThe behavior of both U.S. spectators and the U.S. team was criticized by both American and European media. U.S. spectators raucously heckled and abused European players. Allegations were also made regarding cheating on the part of course marshals. Notoriously, the U.S. team raucously invaded the 17th green after Leonard had holed his long putt but before Olazábal had attempted his shorter putt. The incident was viewed by many in both the US and Europe as appalling sportsmanship. Veteran broadcaster Alistair Cooke described the last day of the tournament as \"a date that will live in infamy\" in a \"Letter from America\" entitled \"The arrival of the golf hooligan\".\nAt the time, the American win was the largest final day come-from-behind victory in Ryder Cup history; Europe achieved the same feat in 2012. It is still widely regarded as one of the most impressive come-from-behind victories in recent sports history.\nThis was one of the last public appearances of Payne Stewart, who died in a plane crash less than a month later.\nPre-match comments.\nIn the lead-up to the Ryder Cup, Payne Stewart said of the European team, \"On paper, they should be caddying for us.\" Jeff Maggert echoed the sentiment in a press conference prior to the matches, saying, \"Let's face it, we've got the 12 best players in the world.\" Colin Montgomerie declined to react, saying, \"You want someone to bite. Well, I'm not going to.\"\nThe course.\nThe Country Club, located in Brookline, Massachusetts, is one of the oldest country clubs in the United States. It was one of the five charter clubs which founded the United States Golf Association, and has hosted numerous USGA tournaments including the U.S. Open in 1913, won by then-unknown Francis Ouimet. The club is one of the largest of its kind in the northeastern U.S., with about 1300 members.\nThe club has two courses, but neither was used in its entirety for the Ryder Cup. The 18-hole Main Course, regularly played by club members, is essentially identical to the original 18-hole course completed in 1899 and used for the 1913 U.S. Open. The 9-hole Primrose Course was added in 1927. Major events that require a longer course, such as the Ryder Cup, use a layout most often known as the Championship Course, using 15 holes from the Main Course and replacing three with parts of the Primrose Course. Specifically, one hole of the Main Course is replaced by a composite hole that uses the teeing ground of the 1st Primrose hole and the putting green of the 2nd Primrose hole, and two holes from the Main Course are entirely replaced by the 8th and 9th holes of the Primrose Course.\nTelevision.\nThe 33rd Ryder Cup was covered live in the United States for all five sessions. USA Network covered the Friday action, with Bill Macatee and Peter Kostis in the 18th tower. The weekend was covered live by NBC Sports, with Dick Enberg and Johnny Miller in the 18th tower, Dan Hicks calling holes, and on-course reporters Gary Koch, Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and John Schroeder. Jim Gray conducted interviews, and on the final day was also used as a fifth on-course reporter. On the weekend, former European Ryder Cup captain Bernard Gallacher was brought in as a guest analyst to provide a European perspective.\nIn the UK, BBC and Sky Sports both had a presence, with Peter Alliss and Ewen Murray being the lead broadcaster for each with contributions from Butch Harmon, Bernard Gallacher, Peter Oosterhuis and Tony Jacklin.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format used from 1991 to 2002 was as follows:\nWith a total of 28 points, 14 points were required to win the Cup, and 14 points were required for the defending champion to retain the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes.\nTeams.\nTeam Europe.\nThe 1999 European Team Points Table began in September 1998, and concluded on August 22, 1999, after the BMW International Open. The top 10 players in the Points Table qualified automatically for the team. Captain Mark James then left out the number 11 player Robert Karlsson and the experienced (but out-of-form) Bernhard Langer by instead selecting Andrew Coltart and Jesper Parnevik as the two 'wild card' players to round out the team.\nCaptains picks are shown in yellow; the world rankings and records are at the start of the 1999 Ryder Cup.\nAs vice-captains, European captain Mark James selected Ken Brown and Sam Torrance, to assist him during the tournament.\nTeam USA.\nThe 1999 U.S. Ryder Cup Team was chosen on the basis of points compiled by the PGA of America, early 1998, through the 81st PGA Championship, August 12–15, 1999. Points were awarded for top-10 finishes at PGA Tour co-sponsored or sanctioned events, with added emphasis on major championships and events played during the Ryder Cup year. The top 10 finishers on the points list automatically qualified for the 12-member team, and U.S. Captain Ben Crenshaw selected the final two players—Steve Pate and Tom Lehman.\nCaptains picks are shown in yellow; the world rankings and records are at the start of the 1999 Ryder Cup.\nAs vice-captains, United States captain Ben Crenshaw selected Bruce Lietzke and Bill Rogers, to assist him during the tournament.\nFriday's matches.\nMorning foursomes.\nPaul Lawrie hit the opening tee shot to begin the 33rd Ryder Cup Matches. The Americans got off to a good start when Tom Lehman chipped in at the first hole, but the matches quickly swung toward Europe's favor. With the Americans' top two pairings losing, the Europeans gained confidence, finding a dynamic duo in Jesper Parnevik and Sergio García.\nAfternoon four-ball.\nLee Westwood and Darren Clarke defeated Tiger Woods and David Duval, the top two players in the world rankings. Woods missed a short eagle putt at the 14th that would have squared the match, while Westwood hit a fantastic chip shot at the final hole to secure victory. Both Duval and Woods were shut out on day one.\nThe day's best match, and arguably the best team match of the week, pitted Parnevik and García against Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk. Parnevik holed out for eagle at the par-4 eighth, putting him and García a combined 6-under-par for the match, but just 1 up. At the 13th, Furyk chipped in from near a pond to square the match, giving the American fans a chance to go into a frenzy. At the next hole, Garcia pitched in for an eagle from just the right of the green at the par 5, putting Europe back in front. At the 16th hole, with the Americans 1 down, Mickelson hit his tee shot inside of four feet from the hole. He was left with the short putt to square the match, but missed it, and the Americans continued to trail. At the final hole, Mickelson again put the ball within five feet of the hole, but again missed the putt, leaving the Americans with an agonizing 1 down loss, and keeping Parnevik and García unbeaten.\nSaturday's matches.\nMorning foursomes.\nTiger Woods won his first match of the week, teaming with new partner Steve Pate. Woods eagled 14 while Pate hit a shot from the rough at the 18th to within 15 feet to secure the win over Pádraig Harrington and Miguel Ángel Jiménez.\nJesper Parnevik and Sergio García won their third straight match, dominating the back nine to handily beat Justin Leonard and Payne Stewart.\nThe final match on the course pitted Jeff Maggert and Hal Sutton against Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie. Maggert took the match into his hands in the final holes, making a long birdie putt at 17 to put the Americans in front, then sealing the win by hitting his approach within 5 feet at the final hole.\nAfternoon four-ball.\nWith the Americans desperate to climb back into the contest, Captain Ben Crenshaw changed up some pairings in hope of making up at least two points. After playing with Maggert during the first three sessions, Sutton teamed with Leonard, but could only produce a half against the Spanish duo of Miguel Ángel Jiménez and José María Olazábal.\nWoods and Pate played together again, facing Montgomerie and Lawrie. Pate chipped in for birdie at the first hole, just as Lehman had done the day before, also while playing with Woods. However, the world #1 missed key putts on the back nine and lost for the third time in four matches.\nPhil Mickelson finally found his game, nearing holing out for eagle at the 10th, as he and Tom Lehman defeated Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke.\nThe most dramatic finish of the session came in the match pitting Davis Love III and David Duval against García and Parnevik. Love had hit a heroic approach at the 9th from a large rock formation to secure an eagle, followed by a Duval birdie at 10 to go 1 up. Parnevik then responded by pitching in for a par at the 12th to halve the hole, causing García to engage in a large display of emotion, running onto the green pumping his fists, then doing a victory lap. However, the Americans were on the verge of handing the European duo their first loss of the week, with Love and Duval still 1 up on the final hole. Both Love and García had birdie opportunities. Love's putt was to win the match, but he missed. García then holed his birdie to salvage a half point, keeping he and Parnevik undefeated for the week, and causing another wild European celebration.\nSunday's singles matches.\nNo team had previously come back from more than two points down on the final day to win the Ryder Cup. Team Europe captain Mark James put most of the team's strength at the back of the lineup. Meanwhile, Ben Crenshaw arranged the American lineup to put most of the strength at the beginning, knowing that a fast start was needed if the Americans were going to recover from the four point deficit. This led to several early mismatches. James had not played three of his rookies during team play: Jarmo Sandelin, Jean van de Velde, and Andrew Coltart. Due to the opposite strategies, this resulted in the three rookies playing their first Ryder Cup matches against the three top American players at that time, Phil Mickelson, Davis Love III, and Tiger Woods.\nTom Lehman and Lee Westwood, playing in the lead match, halved the first three holes. However, the Europeans seemed to pick up where they had left off when Darren Clarke chipped in at the opening hole, though Hal Sutton squared the match at the next hole and did not trail again. The matches were close in the early stages, but then Love chipped in at the 5th for a birdie, which seemed to inspire his teammates. Woods, looking much more comfortable in individual play, followed with a chip-in of his own a few minutes later at the 8th, which caused an enormous roar from the crowd that could be heard through the course. The Americans now had the lead in the first six matches. Love secured the first point of the day, winning 6 &amp; 5 over Van de Velde, followed quickly by Lehman and Sutton. Mickelson and Sandelin previously had a history with each other, stemming from the 1996 Alfred Dunhill Cup. Sandelin drew the ire of the American fans, who were well aware of the incident, which led to a strange exchange at the second hole. Sandelin missed a short putt for birdie, for which the crowd cheered, prompting Sandelin to raise his hands in mock acknowledgement of the cheering. He never looked comfortable and lost to Mickelson 4 &amp; 3. Jesper Parnevik, separated from García, looked out of sorts, losing six of the first eight holes against David Duval, and lost by a five-hole margin. Woods then closed out Coltart to give the U.S. a 12–10 lead, their first lead of the week.\nThe Americans had won the first six matches of the day. Pádraig Harrington got the Europeans their first point of the day when his opponent Mark O'Meara could not escape a bunker at the final hole. Steve Pate answered by defeating Miguel Ángel Jiménez. The biggest European win came from the anchor match, with Paul Lawrie winning three of the first eight holes against Jeff Maggert, and going on to win 4 &amp; 3. However, Sergio García lost by the same margin to Jim Furyk, his first loss of the week. Both Parnevik and García lost by large margins in singles after going undefeated in team play.\nThe Americans now led 14–12, with two matches on the course. The U.S. now needed just half a point to win, while Europe needed two points to retain the cup in a tie situation. The remaining matches pitted Colin Montgomerie against Payne Stewart, and José María Olazábal against Justin Leonard. Montgomerie and Stewart had gone back and forth for much of the front nine, with both players making several long putts. Montgomerie then won the 12th to move 2 up. Stewart won the 14th, while both players found trouble at 15, and both faced lengthy par putts. Montgomerie missed from 15 feet, while Stewart holed from 35 feet to square the match with three holes to play. Stewart's excited fist pump has been used on many Ryder Cup promotional materials, including NBC's telecast opens, since his death a month later.\nMeanwhile, the other match appeared to be a blowout with Olazábal leading Leonard 4 up with just seven holes to play. However, the Spaniard played the next three holes in 5–6–5, losing all three, to drop his lead to one hole. Leonard then sunk a 40-foot putt at the 15th to square the match, a scene very similar to Stewart's putt at the same green. At the 17th, Leonard had another 40 footer for birdie, with Olazábal about 15 feet closer. Leonard holed the unlikely birdie, sending the American team into a frenzy. The team, their wives and NBC cameramen all ran onto the green to hug Leonard, with the cameramen allegedly stepping in Olazábal's line which is considered a breach of golf etiquette. Eventually order was restored, and Olazábal had a 25-foot putt to keep Europe's hope alive. He missed the putt which gave Leonard a 1 up lead with 1 hole to play. This guaranteed the U.S. the half-point they needed to win the Ryder Cup and complete the improbable comeback. Olazábal managed to win the 18th hole with a birdie and the match was halved.\nWith the crowd in a frenzy, the marshals unable to keep order, and the result already decided, Stewart conceded the putt Montgomerie had to win on the 18th, in a gesture of sportsmanship for the abuse Montgomerie in particular had suffered throughout. This made the final score 14–13 officially.\nAftermath.\nSeveral members of the European team were critical of the actions of the U.S. team and fans. Colin Montgomerie said that his father had left the course due to the amount of abuse that Montgomerie was receiving, and Mark James reported that a fan had spat at his wife. Andrew Coltart's caddy claimed that a course marshal had concealed Coltart's lost ball until five minutes had elapsed, resulting in a one-stroke penalty for Coltart. Vice-captain Sam Torrance stated that many of those who had run onto the green had done so over Olazábal's putting line, and further singled out Tom Lehman's behavior on the final day as \"disgusting\" for someone who \"calls himself a man of God\".\nSome of the American players afterwards apologized for the behavior of their team. American newspapers were also critical of their side: \"The Washington Post\" stated that \"It seems an American team can't get through an international competition without acting like jackasses at some point\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the American team as having \"violated every principle of proper golf decorum and decent manners.\"\nIndividual player records.\nEach entry refers to the win–loss–half record of the player.\nSource:"

        "title": "2000 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 2000 Giro d'Italia was the 83rd edition of the Giro. It began with a prologue that navigated through the Italian capital Rome. The race came to a close on June 4 with a mass-start stage that ended in the Italian city of Milan. Twenty teams entered the race that was won by the Italian Stefano Garzelli of the team. Second and third were the Italian riders Francesco Casagrande and Gilberto Simoni.\nIn the race's other classifications, rider Francesco Casagrande won the mountains classification, Dimitri Konyshev of the team won the points classification, and rider Fabrizio Guidi won the intergiro classification. finished as the winners of the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" classification, ranking each of the twenty teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. The other team classification, the \"Trofeo Super Team\" classification, where the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team was won by .\nTeams.\nThe race organizers RCS Sport invited twenty teams to participate in the race. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 180 cyclists. Out of the 180 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 127 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams that took part in the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nMarco Pantani () – who was expelled the previous year for having high levels of hematocrit – announced his intentions to race the Giro a few weeks prior to the race despite only racing a few times during the year. Francesco Casagrande () was seen as a favorite because of his victory at the 1999 Tour de Suisse; however, a doping suspension, marred the rest of his season. Paolo Savoldelli was found to be in good form following an overall victory at the Tour de Romandie.\nTim Maloney of \"CyclingNews\" stated that 's Ivan Gotti, who had won the previous year's race following Pantani's disqualification, desired to prove he is a legitimate contender. He added that the young rider Danilo Di Luca will be competing in his second Giro and he will aim for a stage victory.\nSprinter Mario Cipollini, a favorite to win the stages if they come to a bunch sprint, started the race after battling asthma in the preceding weeks. Ivan Quaranta () was another rider that was seen as a contender for the sprint stages, along with reigning Italian road race champion Salvatore Commesso ().\nRoute and stages.\nThe race route was revealed by the organizers in Milan at the Teatro Lirico. This running of the Giro contained three individual time trial events, one of which was the prologue the race began with. There were a total of ten stages that contained categorized climbs; five of which contained climbs of higher categories, while the other five stages held only categorized climbs of lesser degree. The remaining nine stages were primarily flat stages.\nOf the mountain stages, three ended with summit finishes: stage 5 to Peschici, stage 9 to Abetone, and stage 18 to Prato Nevoso. One other stage had a summit arrival, the demanding stage 20 climbing time trial up the Sestriere.\nThe race began in Rome to celebrate the Great Jubilee, with the opening prologue passing historic sites such as the Colosseum and Imperial Forum. The race then headed down the coast to Scalea through the first week, before turning east to Matera, then heading north through Apulia, travelling along a length of the Adriatic coast.\n\"CyclingNews\" writer Tim Maloney felt that the first difficult stage to be raced would be the eighth stage, which featured three major categorized climbs across of racing.\nClassification Leadership.\nIn the 2000 Giro d'Italia, five different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the \"Cima Coppi\"), which in 2000 was Colle dell'Agnello, afforded more points than the other first-category climbs.\nThe fourth jersey represented the intergiro classification, marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey.\nThere were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. Other awards included the Bilboa most combative trophy classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Russian Dmitri Konyshev won the most combative classification. The Top Runner Trophy Liquigas classification was won by Francesco Casagrande."

A quarterback from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Wilson was selected by the Saints with the first selection of the 1981 supplemental draft.\nCollege.\nWilson attended Katella High School in Anaheim, California. He had a reputation for a strong arm and quick release, when he received a scholarship from the University of Illinois in the Big Ten Conference.

The New Orleans Saints, under new head coach Bum Phillips, took him with the first pick of that years draft which is great for an athlete, as the heir apparent to longtime starter Archie Manning.\nTorn ligaments in his left knee incurred in a preseason game on August 12, 1982, required surgery and ended his year; it affected his mobility for the rest of his career.

        "text": "Ian Blake Johnson (born September 25, 1985) is an American former football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Boise State.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Monrovia, California, Johnson attended Damien High School in La Verne, where he was a two-sport star in football and track. In football, he was named Inland Valley Offensive Player of the Year, \"L.A. Times\" All-San Gabriel Valley first-team, San Gabriel Valley Tribune All-Area first-team, Daily Bulletin Inland Valley All-Area Team, All-Sierra League MVP, and CIF Division II first-team all-league as a senior. Johnson was also a team captain for the Spartans and set Damien High School records in career rushing yards, season rushing yards (2,009 yards) and points scored (347). He was a high school teammate of Arena Football League star, Nick Davila.\nAlso a standout track &amp; field athlete, Johnson was an All-Sierra League and All-CIF pick while competing in the 100-meter dash (11.17 s), 200-meter dash (23.03 s), and 4 × 100 m relay (43.38 s).\nCollege career.\nJohnson was redshirted for the 2004 season. In 2005, he rushed for 1,445 yards, at that time the second-most by a freshman in Broncos history, scoring 14 touchdowns. In his illustrious career at BSU, Johnson ran for 4,158 yards and 58 touchdowns, surpassing Marshall Faulk to set a new WAC record for career rushing touchdowns.\nThe Broncos finished the 2006 regular season unbeaten (12–0) and became only the second-team from outside the BCS conferences to play in a BCS bowl game. They played in the Fiesta Bowl against the Oklahoma Sooners, the year's Big 12 champion. Johnson scored the game-winning two-point conversion in overtime on a Statue of Liberty play to the left side. Boise State defeated Oklahoma 43–42, completing a perfect 13-0 season. Johnson rushed for 100 yards and a touchdown. \nJohnson had been considered a dark horse Heisman Trophy candidate. However, shortly after the announcement of his consideration for the Heisman Trophy, a collapsed lung sidelined Johnson for one game and hurt his chances of winning the Heisman. After the end of the 2006 regular season, he led NCAA Division I-A in scoring with 24 touchdowns. On December 7, 2006, \"Sports Illustrated\" named Johnson to their 2006 All-American first-team. This made Johnson the first Boise State athlete to be named to a major All-American team. CBSSports.com also named him All-America in 2006. He was also named to the All-WAC team, won a Division I-A Offensive Player of the Week award, two WAC Offensive Player of the Week awards, and was a semifinalist for the Doak Walker Award.

        "title": "FIA GT3 European Championship",
        "text": "The FIA GT3 European Championship was a sports car racing series organized by the Stéphane Ratel Organisation (SRO) and regulated by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It was a championship derived from the international FIA GT1 World Championship, but meant to provide competition for more amateur racers in closer to production cars. The series used extensive performance balancing and handicap weights to make cars more equal.\nFIA GT3 European Championship races served as support races for the FIA GT1 World Championship races that took place in Europe.\nHistory.\nThe FIA GT3 European Championship was launched in 2006 as a way to expand manufacturer involvement in motorsports as well as to help amateur drivers across Europe. It attempts to combine multiple one-make series into a larger event with a race within a race, teams competing not only to beat others in their own manufacturer cup but also to win the overall race.\nIn the future, the FIA and SRO plan to not only expand the overall European championship, but also to help in the development of multiple one-make series across Europe, similar to the Ferrari Challenge and Porsche Supercup.\nVehicles.\nFollowing in the established name usage from FIA GT, the FIA's Group GT3 differs from its GT1 and GT2 counterparts by using more low-cost engineering and design elements in the development of the road cars to their racing counterparts, as well as attempting to make all cars equal by pre- and in-season performance balancing adjustments. Unlike FIA GT1's GT1, the GT3 class cars are not allowed to be developed by their manufacturers over the course of a racing season. Manufacturers simply provide a ready-to-race car to a customer and the teams are limited in what they can alter from production specs. All cars that participate in GT3 must be allowed permission and equalized with the competition by the FIA.\nThe Jaguar XKR, Ford Mustang FR500GT, Ford GT, and Morgan Aero 8 were added to the homologation list for 2007, while the Venturi Atlantique silhouette, Maserati Trofeo, and Lotus Exige were all dropped due to lack of participation. The Jaguar XKR, Ford Mustang, and Morgan were eventually dropped by the 2011 season. The Audi R8 LMS and the Alpina B6 were homologated for 2009, while the Ferrari F430 GT3 was replaced by the 430 GT3 Scuderia. The Alpina B6 and Chevrolet Corvette Z06R were also dropped by the 2011 season, while the Ferrari 430 GT3 Scuderia was replaced with the 458 Italia GT3. \nFrom 2006-09 teams were limited to a maximum of 3 cars, with each car having 2 drivers. From 2010 teams are limited to a maximum of two cars, each with two drivers. A team must use the same type of car for each of their entries. There can be no more than six entries per marque (three two car teams), although teams entering cars in the GT1 championship can enter cars in GT3 beyond this restriction.\nDrivers.\nThe drivers in FIA GT3 are not on the same level as those in FIA GT, in that they are intended to be more amateur drivers than the professionals who are hired in FIA GT. The term gentleman driver is that most commonly used to describe the drivers in FIA GT3. However, in order to ensure that the drivers in FIA GT3 are of amateur status, the FIA put into place rules regarding what determines a driver's skill level. \nDrivers under the age of 55 who fit the following criteria are not allowed in FIA GT3:\nException to this is that drivers over the age of 45 can petition the SRO and FIA to be allowed to race even with prior professional experience.\nRaces.\nFor each event in the FIA GT3 season, two individual races are held. Each driver on the two car team qualifies the car individually, and then starts each of the two races from their respective starting position, with one driver starting the first race and the other driver starting the second race. Each race requires one pit stop, where the team must switch between the two drivers, as well as change all four tires. Each team is limited to only two crew members in the pits during a pit stop. All races are one hour in length.\nChampionships.\nFIA GT3 attempts to present itself as a gathering of cup races. Besides the fact that all cars are individually fighting against others to have a race win, cars are also meant to be competing against cars of their same make. Each individual make in GT3 has their own respective drivers championship alongside the overall GT3 Teams Championship and Drivers Championship.\nPoints are awarded to the top eight on the scale of 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1, with each car in a team scoring points even if multiple entries finish in scoring positions.\nSimilar series.\nOn November 29, 2006, the German ADAC launched a race series known as GT Masters, which will be a national level series for FIA GT3 cars. Their initial season in 2007 will feature six races (all but one in Germany), serving as support races for the 24 Hours Nürburgring and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters. The series is the first national level version of FIA GT3.\nIn 2005 the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport launched the return of the Australian GT Championship which uses older GT2 and GT3 cars with balanced performance. the Australian GT Championship allows GT3 cars and will allow older GT cars as well.\nStarting from 2007, the GT3 Brasil Championship has been held in Brazil, also organized by SRO, with several veteran drivers racing in some events, such as former Formula One champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet and former Brazilian Stock Car champions Chico Serra and Alexandre Negrão, who also was the first series champion. Differently from the European series, GT3 Brasil accepts professional drivers, in a system where drivers are graded from A (International Driver) to D (Fully Amateur), however, at least one of the drivers in each car must be of amateur status (C or D), except if a team is composed of two B-graded drivers, in that case, the car gets a 60 kg ballast penalty.\nVarious other championships are also running now which allow GT3-spec cars to participate, notably British GT Championship, FFSA GT Championship, Belcar, Super GT and Super Taikyu.\nIn 2007 the SRO and FIA have launched a similar championship, known as the GT4 European Cup, which features the same concept of using serial production sports cars, but with smaller engine sizes, minimum modifications and restrictions on the professionalism of participating drivers.\nIn 2010-12, the FIA GT1 World Championship acted as a senior series to this series. Drivers in GT1 drive were more experienced (and can be hired by the factory), drove more powerful cars, and the season was longer and visited more countries (including non-European countries). Because the GT1 Championship allowed performance balanced GT3 cars and 2009-spec GT2 cars in 2012, the only difference in the car lineups was the GT3 Championship still being restricted to GT3 cars. All GT3 races occurred on the same weekend as a corresponding GT1 race, and the races were also at different times of the day (e.g. Paul Ricard hosts both a GT1 and a GT3 race on the same weekend). Some manufacturers like Aston Martin had raced cars in both the GT1 and GT3 championships."

Clapp, who predominately played as a catcher, also played as an outfielder. Over his career, Clapp compiled a career batting average of .283 with 459 runs scored, 713 hits, 92 doubles, 35 triples, 7 home runs, and 834 runs batted in (RBI). Over 1,188 games played, Clapp struck out 51 times. Although the majority of his career was spent in the major leagues, Clapp also played two seasons of minor league baseball. He made his MLB debut at the age of 21 and was listed as standing and weighing . His brother, Aaron Clapp, also played one season of MLB for the Troy Trojans.\nEarly life.\nJohn Edgar Clapp was born on July 15, 1851, in Ithaca, New York.\nProfessional career.\nIn 1872, Clapp began his professional career with the Middletown Mansfields of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NA). Over 19 games played, Clapp batted .278 with one home run and a team-high 30 runs scored while managing the team to a 5–19 record. After the team folded, Clapp joined the Philadelphia Athletics. His single home run tied him for the team-lead along with Wes Fisler, Cherokee Fisher, and Tim Murnane. Next season, in 1874, Clapp led the NA in at bats per home run (55); his OPS (.732) was a career-high, while the Athletics finished the season 33–22, third in the NA, under manager Dick McBride. In his final year with the club, Clapp batted .264 with 77 hits and 39 RBI. His putout total was second in the NA among catchers.\nIn 1876, Clapp joined the St. Louis Brown Stockings of the National League (NL). He finished the year tied for the team lead in games played (64) and hits (91), while he led the NL in putouts as a catcher, with 333.

        "text": "The Finder Darts Masters was a darts tournament held in Egmond aan Zee, Netherlands, sanctioned by the British Darts Organisation and the World Darts Federation, running intermittently under several different names from 1995 to 2018.\nThe tournament was previously known as the Zuiderduin Masters from 2007 to 2014, as the Leendesk Masters in 2005, as the Doeland Grand Masters from 2001 to 2004, as the European Grand Masters in 2000, and as the Dutch Grand Masters in 1995 and 1996. It was held in December and was traditionally the last BDO event held before the annual World Championship. The tournament was an unranked event until 2008, when it was installed as a ranking event, along with the World Championships and the World Masters, following the cancellation of the World Darts Trophy and the International Darts League.\nThe organizers of the event announced in 2019 that that year's event would not take place due to the termination of the sponsorship with Dutch e-commerce company Finder, and the tournament has been discontinued. \nHistory.\n1995–1996: Dutch Grand Masters.\nThe competition began in 1995, known as the Dutch Grand Masters with Raymond van Barneveld and Francis Hoenselaar winning their first major tournament.

Following sponsorship from the Hotel Zuiderduin, a women's competition was added in 2008 and after a demonstration tournament for juniors in 2010, a juniors competition was added in 2011. A new three-year contract was agreed in 2011 for it to remain the Zuiderduin Masters up to 2014.\nThe first nine-dart finish at the tournament was recorded by Darryl Fitton in 2009.\n2015–2018: Finder Darts Masters.\nFinder, an international operating company, took over the naming rights to the tournament from the 2015 edition onwards.

In 2002 the ground was given its present name to commemorate Pierre Werner (1913–2002), formerly Prime Minister of Luxembourg and honorary president of Optimists Cricket Club. The ground was established on land donated by the Walferdange commune, adjacent to the Alzette river.\nThe ground has hosted matches between the Luxembourg national team and various other teams, including the Belgium national team and the MCC. The heavy use of the ground is illustrated by the programme in 2003, when it \"was in use almost every day between mid-April and early October\". That year two internationals against France and one against Belgium were played on the ground (though one of the games against France was rained off). A six-a-side tournament was hosted in 2007.\nThe ground is the only outdoor venue regularly used for cricket in Luxembourg, with the only other venue being Robert Schuman Oval, located over the French border in Évrange. The ground's pitch is artificial matting on concrete.\nThe ground hosts a one-week junior training academy each July. In 2010 this was attended by forty boys and girls of all ages, who were coached by a Level 3 coach from the UK and benefited from the ground's \"excellent facilities\".\nIn August 2020, the ground was selected to host the 2020 Luxembourg T20I Trophy, a tri-series between Luxembourg, Belgium and the Czech Republic.\nList of International Centuries.\nTwenty20 Internationals.\nThis is the list of centuries scored at the ground in Twenty20 Internationals."

Teams are also sponsored by the local government and sponsors.\nIn 2008, it merged with the Mindanao Visayas Basketball Association (MVBA), and Third Force Inc. (TFI) to form the new Liga Pilipinas.\nHistory.\nAfter the Metropolitan Basketball Association (MBA) folded up in 2002, the clamor for a regional basketball did not die down.\nSeveral leagues with the community-based concept started to surface but none of them lasted.\nOn such league was the National Basketball League (NBL), owned and operated by the Basketball Association of the Philippines (BAP), the former Philippine basketball governing body.\nIn 2003, the BAP had asked the NBL group to give back the \"National Basketball League\" name and rights to the BAP. The NBL officials did so, regrouped, and came up with a new name: the National Basketball Conference, a league totally independent of the BAP.\nIn 2004, the NBC played its first season with 8 teams participating, forming two divisions, Northern (Baguio Cardinals, Forward Taguig, Laguna Springs and Batangas 29ers) and Southern (Iloilo Warriors, Tribu Sugbu-Cebu, Cagayan de Oro Stars, Ozamiz Cotta). It still adopted the MBA's Home and Away format, but introduced the \"Road Swing\" wherein which cross-division contests required a team to tackle all its opposition in one road trip (usually lasting a little more than one week). This formula was drawn up by then Basketball Operations chief Noel Zarate, who was also the voice behind the original NBC broadcasts. The opening game featured a matchup between the visiting Iloilo Warriors against the Cagayan de Oro Stars. The game went into double overtime with the visitors prevailing 114–110. Iloilo's Carlos Sayon registered 30 points in the win. Tribu Sugbo (then owned by businessmen Lito Gillamac and Albert Tan and coached by former PBA player Al Solis) defeated Forward Taguig (owned by Taguig Freddie Tinga and coached by former FEU mentor Danny Gavieres) in a thrilling three-game series to cop the first NBC National Championship. Egay Echavez of Ozamiz was the first league MVP.\nIn 2005, new teams joined the league that included the Parañaque Jets, who made headlines by defeating the Basketball Association of the Philippines-sponsored RP-Cebuana Lhuillier Team in the NBC Preseason tournament. The Jets, though, failed to make the playoffs as the Ozamiz Cotta won the championship.\nFor the 2006 season, new expansion team joined the league, Pagadian Explorers of Mayor Sammy S. Co, the tournament was divided into two conferences, similar to the format used by the Philippine Basketball Association and the Philippine Basketball League. Ozamiz Cotta won the first conference title in Game 3 against the expansion team Pagadian Explorers, the first ever expansion team in league history to reach finals, while the second conference is also won by Ozamis Cotta via sweep against the Batang Tagaytay Springs.\nFor the 2007 season, a new team joined the league, GenSan-MP Pacman Warriors of boxing legend Manny \"Pacman\" Pacquiao from General Santos. The League has its TV partners the 24-hour Basketball TV and Viva Prime Channel.\nIn 2008, it merged with the Mindanao Visayas Basketball Association (MVBA), and Third Force Inc.

        "text": "Sport Lisboa e Benfica (), commonly known as Benfica, is a professional volleyball team based in Lisbon, Portugal, that plays in the Portuguese First Division, where they are the current champions.\nFounded in 1939, Benfica have won 11 Portuguese league titles, a record 20 Portuguese Cup and a record 12 Portuguese Super Cup. , Benfica is ranked 23rd in the men's European clubs ranking.\nHistory.\nBeginning.\nFounded on 31 May 1939, Benfica is one of the oldest Portuguese volleyball teams. Not having the success and notability of other club sections such as basketball and roller hockey, Benfica's volleyball team won their first title 27 years after being founded.\nRoad to the first title.\nFrom 1965–66 to 1979–80, Benfica played ten Portuguese Cup finals, winning seven. In 1980–81, led by coach Fernando Luís, Benfica finally achieved their first league title, with players such as Luís Quelhas, Manuel Silva, Jorge Infante, José Barros, João Abelho, Pedro Barros, Ilídio Ramos, and already with a young José Jardim appearing in some matches.\nSecond title and disbandment.\nIn a vibrating match against local rivals Sporting CP, trailing 2–0 at Nave de Alvalade, Benfica, now led by captain José Jardim, alongside teammates Nuno Brites, Luís Quelhas, Nilson Júnior, Eduardo Gallina, Miguel Silva, Márcio Karas, Davidkov, and Radoslav Peytchev, managed to recover the disadvantage and win the match 3–2, claiming their second title.\nIn the 1993–94 season, then club president Jorge de Brito decided to disband the volleyball team. The following president, João Vale e Azevedo, restarted it in 1996–97 but in the Third Division. Former player José Jardim led Benfica back to the first tier in 2000 with the help of players such as André Cabacinha, Nuno Brites, António Silva, and captain José Fernandez.\nThird title.\nIn 2004–05, with coach José Jardim and players such as Brazilians Adriano Lamb, Renato Júnior, André França, Roberto Purificação, André Lukianetz, as well as Portuguese players André Lopes, Carlos Teixeira, António Silva, Rui Guedes, António Seco, José Simões, Bruno Feteira, and Pedro Fiúza, Benfica won the third title for the section, plus their 11th Portuguese Cup.\nBetween championships.\nThe next season, important players, such as Adriano Lamb, Renato Junior and André França, left, and Benfica only managed to win the Portuguese Cup and reach the quarter-finals of CEV Top Teams Cup.\nIn the 2006–07 season, Benfica won their third Portuguese Cup in a row and 12th overall.\nThree years later, in 2010–11, Benfica signed Hugo Gaspar and Flávio Cruz, who were later joined by Roberto Reis in 2011–12, all players from the Portugal national team. In spite of these investments, the team failed to win the league, coming runners-up to Fonte Bastardo in the first season, and then to Sporting de Espinho in the second one. Nevertheless, Benfica managed to win the Portuguese Cup and Super Cup in 2010–11, and another Portuguese Cup in 2011–12.\nBack-to-back titles.\nIn 2012–13, Portuguese international Flávio Cruz left for Espinho and was replaced by Brazilian Willian Reffati. A new setter, Brazilian Rafael \"Vinhedo\", was also contracted to replace Ronaldo \"Royal\" and Robert Koch. Benfica started the season by winning their third Super Cup, defeating Espinho 3–0.\nOn 4 May 2013, Benfica defeated league title holders Espinho 3–2 and conquered their fourth championship, after a seven-year wait and three consecutive second places. After SC Espinho protested at the Portuguese Volleyball Federation on a basis of a technical error, the final match was annulled and scheduled to be replayed on 12 May. Still, Benfica won the replay match 3–1. In the following season, on 4 May 2014, Benfica successfully defended their league title by defeating Fonte Bastardo 3–1; consequently, they secured their first back-to-back titles ever.\nOn 9 May 2015, Benfica won a third consecutive league title for the first time in their history, winning away 3–0 away to Fonte Bastardo in the fifth and final match (3–2). Moreover, Benfica also won the Portuguese Cup and Super Cup, thus winning all domestic competitions. On 3 October 2015, Benfica won a fifth consecutive Super Cup and became the club with most trophies in that competition (6).\nInternational competition results.\nNote: Benfica score is always listed first.\nHonours.\nAccording to Benfica's official website"

The program has also appeared at the site of the Final Four.\nIn 2005, the host of the show the first four weeks was Rece Davis, but then the last four weeks Chris Fowler hosted the show. Since 2006, Davis has been the exclusive host of the show. Since the show debuted, Davis has been joined by Digger Phelps, Jalen Rose, Jay Bilas, Hubert Davis, Seth Greenberg, Jay Williams, LaPhonso Ellis and Andraya Carter as analysts. In 2008 during Championship Week, Bob Knight joined the cast, where he remained until 2012. Andy Katz has also served as a feature reporter giving up to the minute news and reports.\nWhen \"College GameDay\" tipped off its 7th season on January 15, 2011, the show expanded to two hours, with the first hour airing on ESPNU, followed by the second hour on ESPN. The first game of the 2011 schedule marked the first time the show has originated from a site that has featured a men's and women's game played in the same day.\nDuke – North Carolina is the most featured matchup, appearing 20 times on College Gameday. The next closest is Florida – Kentucky with 8 appearances. Arizona – UCLA, Kansas – Kentucky and Kansas – Texas currently sit at 4.\nHistory.\nThe program has appeared in many different spots throughout each basketball arena. At Kansas, they were in the program's museum; at Kentucky, they were at the entrance of the arena; at UConn, they were on the concourse; at Gonzaga, Florida, and Marquette, they were on the court; and at Duke, they were in Krzyzewskiville, the tent village outside Cameron Indoor Stadium. It is also worth noting that in recent years (except for the Final Four), the morning airings of this program have taken place on the court.\nThrough the 2022–2023 basketball &amp; football seasons, 41 schools (Arizona, Arkansas, Auburn, Baylor, Boston College, Clemson, Colorado, Duke, Florida, Florida State, Houston, Indiana, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, Kentucky, Louisville, LSU, Memphis, Michigan, Michigan State, Missouri, North Carolina, North Carolina State, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Oregon, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Tennessee, Texas, Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech, UCLA, Vanderbilt, Virginia Tech, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin) have hosted College GameDay for both basketball and football events. With the addition of Women’s teams also hosting College GameDay, only 4 schools: LSU, Tennessee, UConn And Virginia Tech have hosted both Men and Women’s programs. \nStarting with the fourth season (2008), the basketball version of \"GameDay\" is broadcast in high-definition on ESPN HD.\nOn January 16, 2010, the 6th-season premiere of \"College GameDay\", the show was broadcast live from the site of a women's college basketball game for the first time ever as it made an appearance at Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut. The show covered the women's college basketball game between Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Connecticut Huskies.\nOn March 9, 2013, \"College GameDay\" had a men's doubleheader from 2 different sites (Washington, D.C., and Chapel Hill, North Carolina) for the first time in the show's history. On January 18, 2014, \"College GameDay\" opened its tenth season with another men's doubleheader, this time, at The Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and at Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut.\nFor the 2013 and 2014 seasons, the intro for \"College GameDay\" was Macklemore's 2013 hit, \"Can't Hold Us\".\nOn April 7, 2014, longtime analyst Digger Phelps announced his retirement and would not return for the 2015 season. That summer, Jalen Rose announced he would not return due to his priorities with NBA Countdown. As a result of the two departures, ESPN announced that Seth Greenberg and Jay Williams would be analysts for 2015 and beyond.\nOn September 30, 2014, ESPN announced that \"College GameDay\" would no longer have a set schedule, just like the football version of the show. Instead, the location will be chosen the week before to give the network a better opportunity to pick games with ranked teams and interesting story lines.\nOn October 8, 2019, Jay Williams replaced Paul Pierce as an analyst on NBA Countdown, and left College Gameday. LaPhonso Ellis was announced as his replacement.\nOn January 10, 2023, ESPN announced it would be adding three women's college basketball shows in one season, equaling the total number of women's games they had done in the shows history, bringing the overall total for women's games to six. Also since the first time since 2008, ESPN returned to the Final Four in Houston for both the Semifinal &amp; Championship game.\nLaPhonso Ellis was part of significant ESPN layoffs, ending his three year run on the show. It was also announced the Jay Williams would be returning to the show.\nIn the UK, \"College GameDay\" was shown in full during BT Sport's decade on air (2013-2023), unless live sport was being aired on all of its channels. In July 2023, BT Sport was relaunched as TNT Sports following the sale of BT Sport to Warner Bros. Discovery EMEA. This saw the cessation of ESPN studio programming and therefore \"College Gameday\" is no longer shown in the UK. The football version of the show returned in November following an agreement between Sky Sports and ESPN which sees Sky Sports broadcasting three NCAA basketball games each week plus March Madness. However, Gameday has not been seen on Sky Sports since the deal came into effect.\nLocations.\n2024.\nWinners are listed in bold.\nHome team listed in \"italics\" for neutral-site or off-campus games.\nAll rankings displayed for Division I teams are from the AP Poll.\nRankings displayed in parentheses refer to seeding in the NCAA Tournament.\nAppearances by school.\nAnnounced and visited locations as of the March 9, 2024.

        "title": "Basketball Jones featuring Tyrone Shoelaces",
        "text": "\"Basketball Jones featuring Tyrone Shoelaces\" is a song by Cheech and Chong that first appeared on the 1973 album \"Los Cochinos\".\nBackground.\nSung in falsetto by Cheech Marin, playing the title character Tyrone (as in \"tie-your-own\") Shoelaces, it tells the story of Shoelaces' love of basketball. It is a parody of the No. 16 \"Billboard\" Hot 100 song \"Love Jones\" by Brighter Side of Darkness. In the album version, the song is preceded by a mock interview with Jones' basketball coach named \"Umgwana Kickbooti\", in a parody of a \"Wide World of Sports\" interview conducted by a character named \"Red Blazer\".\nThe song's opening lyric, \"basketball jones, I got a basketball jones\", references \"jones\" as slang for craving or addiction. A \"basketball jones\" thus refers to loving basketball so much that it overtakes all other thoughts.\nMusicians who appeared on the record included George Harrison, Billy Preston, Tom Scott, Klaus Voormann and Carole King (so the record became the highest-peaking single on which she appeared during 1973). The Blossoms and Michelle Phillips (from The Mamas &amp; the Papas) performed vocals as cheerleaders on the track.\nSome notes on the recording of the track, taken from the booklet accompanying \"Where There's Smoke There's Cheech &amp; Chong\", read:\nCheech sings, and Tommy plays piano—that's all it was at first. In Cheech's words, \"George Harrison and those guys were in the next studio recording, and so Lou [Adler] just ran over there and played [it for him]. They made up the track right on the spot.\" \"That was a wild session,\" Lou Adler recalls. \"I probably called Carole [King] and told her to come down, but with Harrison and [Klaus] Voorman—I didn't call and say come in and play. Everyone happened to be in the A&amp;M studios at that particular time, doing different projects. It was spilling out of the studio into the corridors.\"\nOther members of the ad hoc supergroup included Nicky Hopkins (piano), Tom Scott (sax), Billy Preston (organ), Jimmy Karstein (drums) and Jim Keltner (percussion).\nChart performance.\nThe song was released as a single in August 1973 and reached No. 15 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming the only spoof to peak higher than the corresponding original. It was backed with \"Don't Bug Me\", also from \"Los Cochinos\". To coincide with the graffiti artwork from the album's cover, both sides of the single feature the Ode label covered with graffiti.\nAnimated film.\n\"Basketball Jones\" is a 1973 animated short film based on the Cheech and Chong song. The cartoon was created to promote the song's release in the United States. It is about a teenager named Tyrone Shoelaces and his love of basketball. The short was designed by animator Paul Gruwell who worked on many series, including \"The Banana Splits\", \"Scooby-Doo\", \"\", \"The Transformers\", \"The Simpsons\", and the film \"Heavy Metal\".\nIn the animation, Shoelaces, who appears as a stereotypical African American, is shown from birth having a skill for \"dribbling\" (in which he is shown to be drooling) and, as a result, his mother gives him a basketball for a gift. Shoelaces takes an immediate liking to the ball and takes it wherever he goes. This sets up a trip to the \"basketball championship,\" in which he begins preaching to potential teammates, coaches, cheerleaders (complete with \"day of the week\" panties visible) to \"help him out.\" A gospel chorus begins singing, and slowly escalates. A few short shots of Shoelaces actually playing basketball, mostly dribbling downcourt on a breakaway, are visible, but the rest of the video is primarily devoted to shots of increasingly unusual and distant people in \"the entire stadium\" and \"around the world\" singing along to \"Basketball Jones.\" At the end of the short, Shoelaces begins growing at a dramatic pace, breaking through the stadium roof and becoming big enough to use the moon as a basketball while Cheech and Chong, Viet Cong, King Kong, alley cats, men in business suits, a mountaintop guru, The Singing Nun, and The Beatles sing along to the song. The short film encapsulates the political moods of the 70s and predicts Richard Nixon's impeachment before the president actually resigned on August 8, 1974.\n\"Basketball Jones\" was originally seen in theaters in late 1973, before showings of Hal Ashby's \"The Last Detail\" at select screens. It can be seen during the 1974 film \"California Split\", directed by Robert Altman, although its use in the film prevented \"California Split\" from being released on VHS or Laserdisc due to Columbia Pictures' refusal to pay royalties for the song. Altman later removed the song (but not the cartoon) from the film so it could be released on DVD.\nThe film was broadcast in the United Kingdom on February 24, 1974, during an episode of the BBC television program, The Old Grey Whistle Test.\nThe cartoon was re-released in 1976, when it was shown before the film \"Tunnel Vision\". The film is perhaps best known for being featured in another highly acclaimed Hal Ashby film, the 1979 Oscar-nominated \"Being There\", where Peter Sellers's character, Chauncey Gardiner watches the cartoon in a limousine."

        "title": "Kent county cricket teams",
        "text": "A variety of Kent county cricket teams played matches from the early 18th century until the formation of the original county club in 1842. The county's links to cricket go back further with Kent and Sussex generally accepted as the birthplace of the sport. It is widely believed that cricket was first played by children living on the Weald in Saxon or Norman times. The world's earliest known organised match was held in Kent c.1611 and the county has always been at the forefront of cricket's development through the growth of village cricket in the 17th century to representative matches in the 18th. A Kent team took part in the earliest known inter-county match, which was played on Dartford Brent in 1709.\nSeveral famous players and patrons were involved in Kent cricket from then until the creation of the first county club in 1842. Among them were William Bedle, Robert Colchin and the 3rd Duke of Dorset. Kent were generally regarded as the strongest county team in the first half of the 18th century and were usually one of the main challengers to Hambledon in the second half. County cricket ceased through the Napoleonic War and was resurrected in 1826 when Kent played Sussex. By the 1830s, Kent had again become the strongest county and remained so until mid-century. The original Kent County Cricket Club was created in 1842.\nEarly cricket in Kent.\nCricket is believed to have developed out of other bat-and-ball games and was probably first played in early medieval times to the south and south-east of London in the geographical areas of the North Downs, the South Downs and the Weald; hence, the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey were its earliest centres of excellence. The world's earliest known organised match took place in Kent, c.1611, at Chevening. A later court case described it as a \"cricketing of the Weald and the Upland versus the Chalk Hill\". Cricket became established in Kent and its neighbouring counties through the 17th century with the development of village cricket and it is possible that the earliest county teams were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660.\nIn 1705, a newspaper recorded an 11-a-side match between West of Kent and Chatham at a place called \"Maulden\", which does not exist. Historians have surmised that the venue must have been either Maidstone or Malling (later West of Kent teams played at Maidstone). Four years later, what is nominally the earliest known inter-county match took place when a Kent team met one from Surrey on Dartford Brent. It is generally believed, as asserted by G. B. Buckley, that \"inter-county matches\" till about 1730 were really inter-parish matches involving two villages on either side of a county boundary. Dartford was an important club in the first half of the 18th century and its team at this time featured William Bedle, who is acknowledged to have been cricket's first great player. The 1709 match is the earliest known mention of Dartford Brent as a venue.\n18th century.\nThe Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS) considers Kent to be one of cricket's \"major counties\" throughout its entire history and rates all Kent county matches in the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as many played by teams called East Kent or West Kent, as important (per the name of their guide, or top-class. The ACS have explained that any match between a strong Kent eleven and another top-class team justifies the classification but caution is needed with nomenclature because of the different committees and sponsors who organised the games and would sometimes use team names other than \"Kent\".\nDartford came under the patronage of Edwin Stead through the 1720s and its team became representative of Kent as a county, often playing against teams from Sussex. Stead developed a keen rivalry with the Sussex patrons Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, and Sir William Gage. Their teams were named by either county or patron's XI. There were three Kent v Sussex matches in 1728 and Stead's team won them all. After the third win, a newspaper reported the outcome as \"the third time this summer that the Kent men have been too expert for those of Sussex\".\nThe 1728 proclamation of Kent's superiority is the first time that the concept of a \"Champion County\" can be seen in the sources and it is augmented by a \"turned the scales\" comment made by a reporter after Sussex defeated Kent in 1729. The 1729 report added that the \"scale of victory had been on the Kentish side for some years past\". In 1730, a newspaper referred to the \"Kentish champions\". In his cricket history, Harry Altham titled his third chapter, which was about cricket in the second quarter of the 18th century, as \"Kent, The First Champions\".\nStrong teams played under the name of Kent throughout the 18th century with several famous patrons including Stead, Robert Colchin (\"Long Robin\"), Lord John Sackville, his son John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and Sir Horatio Mann organising teams. In July 1739, the strength of Kent as a county team was recognised by the formation of an England team, loosely termed \"All-England\" or, more accurately, the Rest of England, to play against them. Kent at this time were led by Lord John Sackville and his team won the first All-England match on Bromley Common; the return on the Artillery Ground was drawn.\nIn 1744, the year in which the \"Laws of Cricket\" were first published as a code, Kent met England four times. The most famous encounter was the one on Monday, 18 June at the Artillery Ground which was commemorated in a poem by James Love and is the subject of the world's second oldest scorecard. It is also the opening match in \"Scores and Biographies\" (although this erroneously records the date as 1746). Kent, whose team included both Colchin and Sackville, won the match by one wicket.\nUnder the Duke of Dorset and Sir Horatio Mann, Kent continued to field a strong team through the last quarter of the 18th century and were, along with Surrey, the main challengers to Hampshire whose team was organised by the Hambledon Club. Dartford had played against a Hambledon team three times in 1756 and Kent played against Hampshire at Broadhalfpenny Down in 1768. Kent played numerous inter-county matches through the 1770s and 1780s, mostly against Hampshire and Surrey. Renowned Kent players in this period included William Bullen, Robert Clifford, Joseph Miller and John Minshull. Large crowds were attracted to games in the county and Derek Birley states in his history that 20,000 gathered at Bourne Paddock for a match against Hampshire in 1772. Kent remained an active county team until 1796 when, probably because of the Napoleonic War, county cricket ceased and was not resurrected until 1825 when Kent met Sussex at Brighton's Royal New Ground.&lt;\n19th century.\nIn the 1822 MCC v Kent match at Lord's, John Willes of Kent opened the bowling and was no-balled for using a roundarm action, a style he had attempted to introduce since 1807. Willes promptly withdrew from the match and refused to play again in any important fixture. His action proved the catalyst for the so-called \"roundarm revolution\".\nBy the 1830s Kent sides began to dominate English cricket, winning 98 matches during the period and being declared the leading county side for six seasons out of the seven between 1837 and 1843. During this period the formation of county sides was initially focused on Town Malling Cricket Club, backed by lawyers Thomas Selby and Silas Norton alongside William Harris, 2nd Baron Harris. Selby and Norton recruited \"the best batsman in England\", Fuller Pilch of Norfolk, to play at Town Malling, maintain the cricket ground and run the connected public house. Alongside other players such as Alfred Mynn, Nicholas Felix, Ned Wenman and William Hillyer, Kent teams selected by Selby played eleven matches at Town Malling between 1836 and 1841. The expense of running county games meant that Town Malling proved too small to support a county club, despite the large attendances that games attracted, and in 1842 Pilch moved to the Beverley club at Canterbury.\nKent struggled against the prominence of Sussex in the early roundarm years but then enjoyed a glorious period in the middle of the century. Rowland Bowen has recorded that a Maidstone newspaper in 1837 described a match between Kent and Nottinghamshire as for the County Championship. This is the earliest known use of the term although the concept of a \"Champion County\" was much older. Kent was duly proclaimed Champion County in 1837 and through most of the 1840s. Mainstays of the Kent team in those years included Alfred Mynn, Fuller Pilch, Nicholas Wanostrocht \"aka\" \"Felix\", Ned Wenman and William Hillyer.\nOn 6 August 1842, formation of the original Kent County Cricket Club took place in Canterbury. The new club played its initial first-class match against England on the White Hart Field in Bromley on 25–27 August 1842. On 1 March 1859, a second county club was established in Maidstone to support the Canterbury club. The two were amalgamated in 1870 to form the present county club."

        "text": "Donald Rex Clark (December 22, 1923 – August 6, 1989) was an American football player and coach who was perhaps best known as the head coach of the USC Trojans football team from 1957 to 1959. He compiled a 13–16–1 record while coaching at USC, going 0–5–1 against rivals UCLA and Notre Dame. The highlight of his career was in 1959, when USC shared the inaugural AAWU title in a three-way tie. However, he remains the only coach to post a losing record at USC over more than one season.\nEarly career.\nClark was born in Churdan, Iowa, and his family moved to Los Angeles when he was 15. He attended USC, where he played as a guard on the football team under coach Jeff Cravath in 1942 before entering the military during World War II.\nPlaying alongside teammates including John Ferraro and Paul Salata, he returned to USC for the 1946 and 1947 seasons, and was captain of the latter team which lost the 1948 Rose Bowl to Michigan.\nHe served in a rifle platoon during the Battle of the Bulge, and lost fillings in six teeth when an 88 shell went off nearby. Following the war he competed in military track meets in the shot put, and received an athletic award from General George S. Patton.\nHe played for the San Francisco 49ers in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1948 and 1949 as a linebacker and guard.\nCoaching.\nIn 1950, he became an assistant coach at Navy under head coach Eddie Erdelatz. He then returned to USC for five years as an assistant under Jess Hill, including the teams which won the 1953 Rose Bowl 7–0 over Wisconsin and played in the 1955 Rose Bowl against Ohio State. When Hill became USC's athletic director in 1957, Clark succeeded him as head coach on the recommendation of players including Jon Arnett. But USC, along with UCLA, Washington and California, was subjected at that time to Pacific Coast Conference sanctions; widespread displeasure over the issue among the various schools would lead to the reorganization of the conference in 1959. When Clark took over, the university had not recruited players for two years and had no scholarship quarterbacks or receivers.\nUSC posted a 1–9 record in his first season—their worst mark since 1901—but improved to 4–5–1 in 1958; Clark recruited talented players such as Marlin and Mike McKeever, and also brought in a number of excellent assistant coaches, including highly popular Marv Goux. The Trojans won their first eight games in 1959 with a team that featured Ron Mix and Willie Wood, sharing the conference title with UCLA and Washington, but were barred from a bowl game due to NCAA sanctions. The 1959 team also had an impressive coaching staff which included John McKay and Al Davis, but after season-ending losses to UCLA and Notre Dame, Clark resigned and was replaced by McKay.\nBusiness.\nClark later became vice president of his family's business, the Prudential Overall Supply of Costa Mesa, California, and eventually became the company's president until his death. A resident of Fountain Valley, Clark died in Huntington Beach, California at age 65 after suffering a heart attack while jogging. He was survived by his wife Dorothy and their eight children, as well as 24 grandchildren."

        "text": "Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium () is a stadium in Beitun District, Taichung, Taiwan. The stadium officially opened on November 9, 2006, replacing the antiquated Taichung Baseball Field. Located on the corner of Chongde Road (崇德路) and Huanzhong Road (環中路), it has considerably more parking available than the old stadium.\nThe stadium is a venue for rock concerts and also hosted Zhang Yimou's Turandot at the Bird's Nest in 2010.\nConstruction.\nConstruction on the stadium began in 2005 and is operating on the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model that is becoming increasingly common among public works projects in Taiwan. The first phase includes 15,000 infield seats, all with seatback chairs. After the second phase was completed in 2008, seating capacity was expanded to 20,000 by adding 5,000 outfield seats.\nMajor events.\nThe first major event hosted by the new stadium was the 2006 Intercontinental Cup, a baseball competition between eight nations from four different continents. South Korea defeated the Philippines in the opener 10–0, followed by Chinese Taipei's defeat against Italy 3–13 on November 9.\nOn the final day of the 2006 Intercontinental Cup it was announced that the 2007 Baseball World Cup will be held in Taichung, with this stadium one of the two to be used for the tournament. The stadium also hosted some games at the 2007 Asian Baseball Championship, which counted as the 2008 Summer Olympics qualifier for the Asia region.\nThe stadium hosted Pool B in the first round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic.\nThe stadium hosted Group A and Quarterfinals of the 2015 WBSC Premier12.\nThe ballpark has hosted a number of games of the Asia Winter Baseball League, most recently in November/December 2018\nThe stadium hosted Pool B in the first round of the 2019 WBSC Premier12.\nThe stadium hosted Pool A in the first round of the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\nWorld Baseball City.\nDue to the success of 2006 Intercontinental Cup, Taichung City Government and Chinese Taipei Baseball Association start striving to hold various of international events in following years. The stadium had hosted 10 International Baseball Federation (IBAF) events in first 10 years since the stadium had established.\nIBAF awarded the World Baseball City medal during the opening ceremony of 2013 18U Baseball World Cup in order to appreciate the contribution that Taichung City Government had done. Taichung City became the first city to be awarded by IBAF. The World Baseball City stele was also erected at the stadium entrance.\nName confusion.\nFrom the beginning of this project, the stadium had been known as the Taichung International Standard Baseball Stadium. However, newspaper reports had referred to it as the Taichung International Baseball Stadium, (dropping the word \"Standard\".) A Chinese language schedule for the 2006 Intercontinental Cup had identified the stadium as the Taichung Intercontinental Stadium.\nAccording to a report in 2006, the mayor of Taichung, Jason Hu, announced that the name of the stadium has been officially designated as Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. This is in honor of the event being the first to be held at the stadium."

        "title": "Dick Wagner (baseball)",
        "text": "Richard Wagner (October 19, 1927 – October 5, 2006) was a sports, entertainment, and broadcasting executive who spent twenty-five years in Major League Baseball. He was best known for running the Cincinnati Reds during the 1970s and the Houston Astros during the 1980s.\nEarly life and careers.\nBorn in Central City, Nebraska, Wagner's career in professional baseball began at a young age. In 1947, only 19 and fresh out of the Navy, he took a position as business manager of a Class D Georgia–Florida League team, a Detroit Tigers affiliate. In a prosperous era for the minor leagues, Wagner steadily worked his way up through leagues and classifications, shifting at one point to the Pittsburgh Pirates chain and working there under the tutelage of Branch Rickey. He held minor league administrative posts in Flint, Michigan; Miami, Florida; San Antonio, Texas; Hutchinson, Kansas; and Lincoln, Nebraska. At Lincoln, in 1958, he was named Top Minor League Executive of the Year by the Sporting News.\nShifting career tracks in 1959, Wagner took a position as General Manager of Pershing Auditorium in Lincoln, Nebraska. In the next decade, he held posts in entertainment and broadcasting. He was an executive for Ice Capades in Hollywood, California. In Salina, Kansas, Wagner ran radio station KSAL. He also served as general manager of The Forum in Inglewood, California, home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Kings. From the Forum, he returned to major league baseball, where he spent the remaining balance of his working years.\nYears with the Reds and the Astros.\nAfter several years as Director of Promotions with the St. Louis Cardinals under Bob Howsam, Wagner followed Howsam to the Cincinnati Reds in 1967. He spent the next fifteen years in the front office during that team's successful run as \"The Big Red Machine\", beginning by supervising business affairs for the Reds, helping to pioneer, develop and refine marketing and promotional efforts that resulted in a series of attendance records while soon being called Howsam's “hatchet man\". Later, he added duties on the player personnel side and in 1978 was made president and general manager of the team. During the years Wagner was part of the organization, the Reds won consecutive World Series titles in 1975 and 1976, in addition to four league flags and six division titles. During his Cincinnati years, he resided in Glendale, Ohio, a greater Cincinnati suburb.\nWagner innovated the practice of Major League teams wearing green-trimmed uniforms on March 17 in honor of St. Patrick's Day. Wagner was the general manager of the Reds, and had green versions of the Reds' uniforms made. The Reds hosted the New York Yankees at Al Lopez Field on March 17, 1978. This was the first time a major league team wore green trimmed uniforms on March 17, a practice adopted in subsequent years by multiple major league teams on St. Patrick's Day. As a general manager, he made trades with the New York Mets by trading away George Foster and Tom Seaver (acquired by Howsam in 1977 from the Mets) to them in 1982. A trade for Vida Blue in early 1978 was scuttled by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. He dismissed Sparky Anderson on November 27, 1978 when Anderson objected to the idea of shaking up his coaching staff. John McNamara would lead the Reds to the division title in 1979. The following year, Pete Rose left the Reds in free agency for the Philadelphia Phillies due to them not meeting his salary demands, which adhered to the practices of the team trying to not play the free agency market and rely on their farm system or with trades. This essentially marked the end of the Reds dominance, as the Reds did not make another postseason until 1990. Joe Morgan (who left the Reds in free agency after 1979) argued that Wagner was the one who effectively broke the \"Big Red Machine\" (it has also been said that the trade of Tony Perez to Montreal by Howsam in 1977 also took its toll on the team). Wagner continued as president and general manager until he was fired by the Reds on July 11, 1983 by owners James and Bill Williams, who replaced him with Bob Howsam on an interim basis.\nWagner was named general manager of the Houston Astros in September of 1985. Wagner acquired players such as Jim Deshaies and Billy Hatcher in his first winter as general manager of 1985. In 1986, various players would come through in free agency or in trades, such as Larry Andersen or Danny Darwin; both would play four years with the team, and while Andersen would later be part of a future legendary trade made by the Astros, Darwin never saw action as a postseason starter because he was being saved for a World Series bid (due to the Astros relying on a three-man trio of starters). His Astros won the 1986 National League West championship, clinching the division with a September 25 no-hitter by team pitching ace Mike Scott; the Astros lost in the 1986 National League Championship Series to the New York Mets in six games. Oddly, lead broadcaster Gene Elston was let go from the team after the season ended, reportedly at the request of Wagner. The 1987 Major League Baseball draft saw Wagner and the Astros pick Craig Biggio as their first round pick. Biggio would go on to play twenty seasons for the team as a future member of the Hall of Fame. Wagner resigned as general manager on October 14, 1987, following a power struggle with team manager Hal Lanier, who disagreed with Wagner over a perception of failing to trade for needs in the bullpen and in the infield. Wagner stated that a lack of understanding over what team owner John McMullen wanted from him was a key factor.\nLater years.\nIn 1988, MLB commissioner Peter Ueberroth and American League President Bobby Brown named Wagner a special assistant in the commissioner office, where he would work closely with Brown. He served as a top-level aide for several years, and he ran the New York staff for a time when Bud Selig took over as commissioner in 1993.\nWagner retired to Phoenix, Arizona with his wife Gloria. There, he served on the board of the Western Art Associates of the Phoenix Art Museum and as a vice-president of the Association of Professional Ball Players of America. Wagner was involved in a car accident in 1999 that resulted in trauma and injuries that required attention for the rest of his life. He died in Phoenix in 2006 from complications of the car accident. He was survived by his two children."

        "title": "Evangeline Baseball League",
        "text": "The Evangeline League began in 1934 as a six–team Class D level minor league with teams based in Louisiana, United States, later adding Mississippi and Texas based franchises. In 1935, the league was expanded to eight teams and ceased operations in 1942, with six teams, during World War II. It resumed activities in 1946, getting promoted to Class C in 1949, and lasted through 1957. The Alexandria Aces were the only team that played in all 21 regular seasons. Due to its association with spicy Cajun cuisine, the league was commonly referred to as the \"Pepper Sauce League\" or the \"Tabasco Circuit\". Newspapers often abbreviated the league's name as \"Vangy\" or \"Vangey\" in headlines.\nHistory.\n1946 gambling scandal.\nThe Evangeline League was affected by a gambling scandal that surfaced after the 1946 Championship series. After the completion of the playoffs, which were won by the Houma Indians, allegations emerged that Houma Indians and Abbeville Athletics players had conspired with gamblers to achieve desired outcomes of three playoff games. At the October 23, 1946 league meeting, it was alleged that Houma players conspired with gamblers for Houma to lose the fourth game of the first round of the playoffs, lose the first game of the second round and win the fourth game of the second round. After learning of the allegations, Judge W. G. Bramham, president of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, summoned the unnamed accused players to attend a hearing on January 10–11, 1947. After interviews and further investigation, five players were put on the ineligible list, meaning they could not play in minor league baseball. Houma players William \"Bill\" Thomas, Leonard Pecou, Alvin Kaiser and Paul Fugit and Don Vettorel of Abbeville were placed on the ineligible list by Branham for their actions. Later, Thomas and Pecou appealed and were ultimately restored to eligibility by George Trautman, Bramham's successor after two years. On August 22, 1949, both players were reinstated and allowed to immediately to return to the Houma roster. After his reinstatement, Thomas would continue his career to set the minor league career records for total games, victories, losses, hits and runs. Baseball reference shows his career record as 305–264 over 24 seasons and other sources have his minor league win total at 383.\n1956–1957 boycotts.\nThe Evangeline League permanently folded following the 1957 season and had never become an integrated league, despite the efforts of major league affiliates (the Chicago Cubs) to assign players to the Lafayette Oilers and integrate team rosters. Lafayette was an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs. In 1956, some boycotts of attending games began after the Lafayette Oilers refused to accept the players to their team. Subsequently, Lafayette Parrish, home of the Baton Rouge Rebels, passed legislation making it illegal for black players to play in its ballparks. The Evangeline League itself also officially banned non–white players from appearing on their rosters. These blocks forced the major league teams to reassign the players to other leagues. Due to boycotts, the 1956 playoff finals, featuring Lafayette, were cancelled as a result. Both the Lafayette Oilers and the Baton Rouge Rebels folded before the end of the 1957 season, on June 20 1957.\nPlayoff history.\nStarting in its second year, the Evangeline League used a Shaughnessy two-round playoff system in which the teams with the teams with the first- and fourth-best records and the second- and third-best records would compete in a semifinal round with the winners competing for the league pennant. In 1948, the league canceled its playoffs due to bad weather, which had reduced attendance significantly, and again in 1956 due to \"decreased interest and attendance.\" In both 1942 and 1957, the league folded before a playoff series could be held.\nIn terms of repeat league champions, the Hammond Berries won the pennant three times, as did the Lafayette White Sox/Oilers; the Alexandria Aces and New Iberia Cardinals/Pelicans won twice; and the Baton Rouge Red Sticks, Crowley Millers, Houma Indians, Jeanerette Blues, Lake Charles Skippers, Opelousas Indians, and Thibodaux Giants each won once."

        "title": "Andy Smith (American football)",
        "text": "Andrew Latham Smith (September 10, 1883 – January 8, 1926) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at the University of Pennsylvania (1909–1912), Purdue University (1913–1915), and the University of California, Berkeley (1916–1925), compiling a career college football record of 116–32–13. As head coach of the California Golden Bears football program, Smith guided his \"Wonder Teams\" to a record of 74–16–7, captured five Pacific Coast Conference titles, and three national championships. Smith was the winningest football coach in school history until he was surpassed by Jeff Tedford in 2011. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951.\nEarly life.\nAndrew Latham Smith was born in Dubois, Pennsylvania on September 10, 1883. As a freshman, he played for Penn State as a fullback. He shined at his position, both fearless and dominating on the field. In two years, he was convinced to transfer to Pennsylvania, then a superior program. There, in his senior season of 1904, he was named first-team All America for the national champion Quakers. After college, he entered the workforce with a degree in chemistry.\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career.\nSmith returned to Penn in 1905 as the coach of the freshmen team and in 1909, when he was 26, he became the head coach of Penn until 1912. During those four years Smith had 30 wins, 10 losses and 3 ties. Following this success he switched to Purdue in 1913, where until 1915, he went 12–6–3.\nCal and the \"Wonder Teams\".\nThe University of California had fielded a competitive football team since 1886. However, in 1906 it began playing rugby instead of football. This was because by that time football was considered a dangerous sport that could lead to serious injuries. California switched back to football in 1915, partly due to the fact that by that time rule changes made the game considerably safer. Due to his reputation, Smith was recruited to come out west and became the first head coach of California's golden era.\nIn 1916, his first year at Cal, Smith posted 6 wins, 4 losses and 3 ties. In 1918, Cal won its first Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) championship. Also in 1918 Smith hired future Cal football and basketball head coach Clarence Nibs Price as his assistant. Price had a southern California connection and was able to recruit key players to the team including Harold \"Brick\" Muller. The 1919 freshmen team went 11-1 and became the core of next year's varsity squad, to be known as the \"Wonder Team.\" The 1920 Golden Bears team won all 9 games, outscored their opponents, 510 to 14, and capped off the season by defeating Ohio State in the Tournament of Roses East-West Game (now known as the Rose Bowl) 28–0. The NCAA has officially recognized them as the national champion of that season, the first from the Pacific Coast. \"The Wonder Team at California in 1920 changed the entire picture of Western football.\"\nNext year the 1921 Golden Bears also finished undefeated and were again invited to play in the Rose Bowl. Smith initially declined this invitation because he thought it was problematic that Cal's opponent, a little known team named the Washington and Jefferson Presidents, had players better than the average college, and at the same time had scholarship requirements well below California's. Eventually Smith agreed to the match. With California being the overwhelming favorite, the match went nothing like it was expected. Because of the heavy rain the night before, it was played in a virtual mud pit. Both defenses were able to hold off their opponents and the game finished in a 0–0 tie. This Rose Bowl was Smith's last.\nThe 1922 team was also undefeated and won the PCC. And same with the 1923 team. Both years the teams were invited to the Rose Bowl, however because of Smith's continuing disputes with the Rose Bowl committee, California declined both invitations. Like the 1920 team, the 1921 and 1922 teams are recognized as a national champion by the NCAA. On January 1, 1925, instead of the Rose Bowl, the 1924 Bears played an independently scheduled game against Pennsylvania at California's Memorial Stadium. Cal had 7 wins, 0 losses, and 2 ties, while 1924 Penn had 9 wins and 1 tie. Some consider Penn to be the best team of that year. California won that game 14–0. During an incredible five-season span from 1920 to 1924, Smith's \"Wonder Teams\" went undefeated, running up a record of 44 wins, 0 losses and 4 ties.\nEven though the two had never met during the Roaring Twenties, Smith's \"Wonder Teams\" are thought to rival Knute Rockne's Notre Dame teams. Furthermore, when in 1960 the Helms Athletic Foundation considered both the Wonder Teams and the Four Horsemen among others, it crowned the 1920 Cal Bears as the greatest football team in American history.\nStrategy and approach to coaching.\nSmith said: \"There are four mental qualifications necessary for success -- Aggressiveness, Obedience, Concentration and Determination. Add to this, Harmonious co-operation and you have the making of a real team.\" Always tough on his players, Smith drilled them until a technique was perfected regardless of the time that it took. Despite this, his players were known to idolize Smith, for they felt his respect towards them and his commitment to the team.\n\"Kick and wait for the breaks\".\nSmith's strategy is encapsulated in a motto: \"Kick and wait for the breaks.\" He became known for his emphasis on the kicking game and defense-oriented strategy out of the short punt formation. During this era, the ball was often moved up the field not through offensive plays, but rather through punting. For Smith this was standard when the ball was held deep in one's territory. And once the opposing team got the ball, the defense was relied on to make the other team's offense lose yards or fumble. To confuse the opponent, the punting could be done on first or second downs. If the opponent's safeties were close to the line of scrimmage, anticipating a short pass or a run, then the ball could be kicked over their heads resulting in a longer punt. This was repeated until a breakthrough play like a long yard rush would eventually occur and flip the field position. It was not uncommon for a team to kick more than 40 punts a game.\nSmith also became known for trick plays such as the now-classic lateral to the halfback followed by a long, forward pass. At the time, because of the plump, rugby-like ball, long passes were unanticipated. Brick Muller, both an offensive and defensive star of the Wonder Teams, became known for this play. His 50-yard passes were previously thought impossible.\nDeath and legacy.\nWhile in Philadelphia shortly after the 1925 season, Smith was hospitalized with pneumonia. Several weeks later on January 8, 1926, he died at age 42 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He left no family, all of his $30,000 estate going to the Berkeley community, including the Elks Club, California chapter of his fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and California Skull &amp; Keys Society, with $10,000 going towards football scholarships.\nSmith's memorial service was held on January 16 at the gates of California Memorial Stadium, and in accordance with his wishes, his ashes were scattered over the stadium field. In 1927, the Andy Smith Bench on the sideline was dedicated in his honor. Built in 1923, the stadium is still known as \"The House that Andy built\" because the Wonder Teams' season tickets completely paid for it. Smith was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951.\nBoth of the following quotes are inscribed on the Memorial Stadium's Andy Smith Bench - \nThe first was Andy Smith's coaching creed and the second was reportedly said by him during his last interview in Philadelphia.\nIn 1949, Garff Wilson, Professor of Dramatic Art and Speech, was asked to write a eulogy for Andy Smith, which was delivered by the ASUC President at the annual Big Game Bonfire Rally. Since then, the Andy Smith Eulogy has been delivered annually by candlelight at the conclusion of the bonfire.\nCoaching tree.\nSmith often hired his former players as his assistant coaches. Walter Gordon who played on both offensive and defensive lines and became a third-team All American in 1918. Shortly after graduating, he was hired as an assistant coach and likely became the first African-American coach at a predominantly white college or university. Similarly, after graduating Brick Muller was hired by Smith to coach the defensive ends.\nSmith's coaching tree includes:"

        "text": "The Indianapolis 500 auto race has been the subject for several motion pictures. It has also received countless references in television, film, commercials, books, and other media. The following is a list of such references.\nHighlight films.\nOfficial highlight films for the Indianapolis 500 date back to about 1949. However, newsreel films and highlight films for races prior to WWII also exist, including footage of the inaugural 500 in 1911. Currently, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway produces an official release. Previously, it was not uncommon for multiple films to be produced annually. Among the companies that sponsored films were Firestone, STP, Bowes Seal Fast, Ford, Chrysler, and Ashland Oil.\nNarration for the films was performed by several individuals, including Sid Collins, Bud Lindemann, Ralph Camargo, Stan Richards, Marvin Miller, Charlie Brockman, Tom Carnegie, Paul Page, and Bob Jenkins. In some of the films, IMS Radio Network audio is used, featuring Jenkins, Mike King, and others.\n\"The Legends of the Brickyard\".\nIn 1987, ESPN re-packaged the Indianapolis 500 highlight films into a television series. The episodes from 1975 to 1986 were included in a series titled \"The Legends of the Brickyard\", which was hosted by Bob Jenkins and Larry Nuber. The duo would appear at the beginning and end of each episode, and at commercial bumpers to add brief commentary about the race. All of the segments were recorded at the Speedway, and most were done in the pit area during practice for the 1987 Indy 500. Additional episodes were added in subsequent years for the races of 1987-1996. Jenkins and Nuber hosted the episode for the 1987 race, but for 1988-1993, only Jenkins appeared since Nuber was no longer with the network. The episodes for 1994-1996 featured no host. Some of the episodes were slightly edited for content and time, and were made to fit a 30-minute broadcast window. The final original episode that aired highlighted the 1996 race, and the series was rerun on ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPN Classic through 2000.\n\"Indy 500: A Race for Heroes\".\nStarting in 1989, ESPN started producing a second Indy 500-related program, \"\". Similar to \"The Legends of the Brickyard\", but each episode focuses on one particular driver, and their career at Indianapolis. It aired in reruns through about 2000. The drivers featured were Sam Hanks, Jimmy Bryan, Mauri Rose, Wilbur Shaw, Tony Bettenhausen, Dan Gurney, Bill Vukovich, Roger Penske, Mark Donohue, Tom Sneva, Bobby Rahal, Danny Sullivan, Troy Ruttman, Jim Rathmann, Louis Meyer, Johnny Rutherford, A. J. Foyt, Rick Mears, Al Unser, Sr., Al Unser Jr., Bobby Unser, Gordon Johncock, Arie Luyendyk, Emerson Fittipaldi, Rodger Ward, and British Invasion. Several episodes were made available on Joost.com, and the Foyt episode was included on a 2007 DVD release.\n\"Indy 500: The Classics\".\nSpeedvision re-packaged the Indianapolis 500 highlight films from 1960 to 1989, with the exception of 1967, and aired them in a 30-minute format. The show was hosted by Mike King and Donald Davidson. When Speedvision reorganized into SPEED, the program was no longer aired.\n\"SportsCentury\".\nThe ESPN documentary series \"SportsCentury\" has featured several Indy 500 drivers. The original top 100 voting included A. J. Foyt (#80) and Mario Andretti (#92), but episodes were not initially created for those two drivers.\nAfter the original run, the series was expanded, and eventually included episodes for the following Indy 500 drivers: A. J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Al Unser, Sr., Bill Vukovich, and Rick Mears. Brickyard 400 winners Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt, and Tony Stewart have also been featured.\nProgram cover art.\nSince the inception of the race in 1911, a collectible Official Program has been sold by the track each year at the race. The cover art for the program is typically created by a notable painter, illustrator, or photographer. With the exception of a period from roughly 1954 to 1976, each annual program has featured a unique cover, many commissioned by a renowned artist.\nRecent program covers/artists:"

        "title": "Pump (skateboarding)",
        "text": " \nPumping is a skateboarding technique used to accelerate without the rider's feet leaving the board. Pumping can be done by turning or on a transition, like a ramp or quarter pipe. When applied to longboards, it is also known as Long distance skateboard pumping or LDP. Pumping is a technique similar to pumping a surfboard.\nTransition.\nTransition pumping can only be done when there is a slope differential between the front and rear wheels. On a ramp it therefore is only possible at the top and bottom of the slope, but in a pipe it is possible at any height above the flat. The rider should push downward on the truck with the greatest slope under the wheels. On the top of a ramp the front wheels should be pushed, and at the bottom the rear trucks should be pushed. On a pipe the weight should be applied to the rear truck throughout the entire transition.\nSlalom.\nFlatland pumping is essentially carving with the proper amount of weight application in order to gain momentum. It involves shifting weight in sync with the board's movements in order to gain momentum, like pivoting, but with all four wheels on the ground. By proper timing, the proper foot position, and the proper set up, impressive results can be achieved.\nLong Distance Pumping.\nLong Distance Pumping (LDP), is the name given to Skateboard pumping for any sustained distance (Slalom by contrast is through cones and usually a short distance, maybe 100 cones 6-12ft separation).\nLDP riders have been breaking world distance records for 24-hour skating, using a combination of pushing and pumping. Recent records include James Peters' 208 mile ride in May 2008, Barefoot Ted McDonald's 242 mile ride on June 14, 2008 during the Ultraskate IV held in Seattle, Washington, and Andy Andras' 309 mile ride in 2016 at the Ultraskate on the Miami speedway. The current 24-hour record is held by Rick Pronk with 313 miles at the 2017 Dutch Ultraskate. The women's world record is held by Saskia Tromp with 262 miles, also at the 2017 Dutch Ultraskate "

Allen was born in Bayfield, New Brunswick, but grew up in Kerrobert, Saskatchewan.\nPlaying career.\nAllen began his career playing in various locations in the east, until he joined the North Battleford Beavers of the Northern Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League, with whom he went to the Allan Cup final in 1937, where they lost to the Sudbury Tigers. After playing four games with the Tigers himself the following year, Allen was then signed by the New York Rangers, and assigned to their New Haven Eagles farm team. Injuries to the Rangers forced them to call up Allen during the 1938–39 season, taking Lynn Patrick's place in the lineup, and he earned 12 points in 19 games. In his debut with the Rangers, he scored 3 points (two goals and an assist), setting a Rangers' mark for most points in his first game (later matched by Dominic Moore in 2003). After the season, his rights were then sold to the Black Hawks, on May 17, 1939.\nWith the Black Hawks Allen became a regular everyday player, and was fifth in team scoring in his first season. His best season ranking-wise with Chicago was 1940-41, when he ranked second, and third in the playoffs. Allen's best season production-wise was 1943-44, when he scored 41 points, good for fifth on the team, and was third in playoff scoring, as Montreal swept Chicago in the Stanley Cup Finals. Allen missed the 1944–45 NHL season due to the National War Labour Board restrictions on crossing the Canada–US border. He played one more year in Chicago, and ahead of the 1946-47 NHL season Allen was traded to the Montreal Canadiens, for Paul Bibeault, with both teams holding \"right of recall\". After the season, the players were returned to their original teams, but after a couple of seasons in the minors, Allen never played in the NHL again. Allen went on to spend one season as a playing-coach during the 1950–51 season with the Regina Capitals.\nAllen's brother Viv played 6 games for the New York Americans in 1940, but as the Americans did not play Chicago in that span, the two brothers never had the chance to play against each other in the NHL. After their hockey careers, the two brothers went into farming together."

        "title": "Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club",
        "text": "Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club (mostly known for its acronym CURCC) was a Uruguayan sports club, originally established by British railway workers for the practise of cricket. Nevertheless, the club would be notable for its football section, considered one of the greatest contributors to that sport in Uruguay. In fact, CURCC was one of the founding members of Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) in 1900.\nThe continuity between the CURCC's football section and club Peñarol generated a controversy that remains nowadays.\nHistory.\nRailway origins.\nBy the end of 1899 the British company Central Uruguay Railway of Montevideo, that operated in Uruguay since 1878, acquired the lands located in the neighborhood of Villa Peñarol to establish its train repair shops there, moving them from Bella Vista. Those lands had been used for agriculture only and famous because of the best quality of its vineyards and fruits. One of the main achievements of the company was the establishment of a rural school in the town.\nDue to the industrial activity, the village became populous. The sons of blonde Albion, who were part of the company, decided to found a sports centre that serve as recreation to people that lived around the workshops.\nFirst years and success.\nAccording to the club's foundation charter, CURCC was established on 28 September 1891 by the workers and employees of the Central Uruguay Railway Company of Montevideo, with the purpose of stimulating the practice of cricket, football and \"other male sports\" (literal from the Spanish). The first committee was formed by eight members: Mr. Hudson, Lucy, Moor, Davenport, Hopkins, Davies, and Penny. They chose Mr. Frank Henderson as the first president of the club. The membership fee was established in $ 0,50.\nOne day later, the committee resolved to name the club \"Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club\". That same day two members of the committee were chosen to write the rules, while two other members were chosen to search for a field to practice sports. The club also designated three members to take over advertising with the purpose of bringing new members to the institution.\nThe article I of club's statute stated that the club colours would be that of the Stephenson’s Rocket locomotive and that only workers of Central Railway would be admitted as members. Nevertheless, the committee could admit people outside the company but they were not allowed to vote in case of being accepted.\nHaving been established as a cricket club, football began to be practised at CURCC in 1892, relegating other sports, such as cricket and rugby. The first football match played by CURCC was that same year versus a combined team of English High School. The match was won by CURCC 3-2.\nAt the beginning, all the CURCC presidents were managers of the CUR. In 1907 the company appointed W. Bayne as manager and sent him to Montevideo. When the CURCC executives told Bayne he was the new president of the institution, he did not accept the offer, alleging that the coaches damaged by the supporters led to significant costs. Other reason given by Bayne was the lack of players-workers.\nIn football, CURCC was one of the founding members of Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) along with Albion, Uruguay A.C. and Deutscher, in 1900. The club played in the recently created Primera División since its first edition in 1900, along with Nacional, other team from Montevideo with whom CURCC had a strong rivalry. While CURCC represented the British immigrants to Uruguay and rail workers as well, the \"criollo\" people and university students felt empathy with Nacional.\nThe club took part of 13 editions of the domestic championship, winning it in five occasions between 1900 and 1911. CURCC also won the Copa de Competencia seven times and the Copa de Honor on three occasions. Internationally, the squad won the Copa de Honor Cousenier twice.\nControversy: C.A. Peñarol.\nBy the 1910s, the Central Uruguay Railway Company (which had been established the club being also its administrator) considered to retire the football section from official practise alleging the club had left behind its original purpose of being a recreational place for employees of the company. There are two different versions about what happened at the end of 1913 related to the foundation of \"C.A. Peñarol\", those are: \nIn 1914, the Uruguayan Association was notified of the \"change of name\" by Peñarol, recognising it as the continuity of CURCC, through a letter signed by AUF president Abelardo Véscoli, on March 17, 1914. As a result, Peñarol filled the CURCC's place in the Uruguayan Primera División to be played in 1914. The club introduced new name, badge, executives, statutes and even a new settlement (Montevideo instead \"Villa Peñarol\").\nOn April 13, 1914, the Ministry of Internal Affairs gave to C.A. Peñarol, including the recognition to the institution as a CURCC's continuity. Nevertheless, there are records of football matches played by CURCC until its dissolution.\nControversy began in 1941, when Peñarol celebrated its 50° anniversary. Some articles published on local newspaper \"El País\" stated that Peñarol was established as an entity with no relation to CURCC. When Peñarol modified its statutes in 1957 and 1958, the Government of Uruguay gave its approval to the text but did not adopt a position on the origins and age of the club.\nThe position about Peñarol as a new institution born in 1913 has been supported by Peñarol's rival Club Nacional de Football since 1991, when the \"Carbonero\" celebrated its 100th. anniversary. The club stated that CURCC and Peñarol coexisted for a period of at least two years until the CURCC dissolved in 1915. According to Nacional's position, on June 2, 1913, the CURCC assembly rejected a change of statute by which the club would change its name to \"CURCC (Peñarol)\"\nOn the other hand, Peñarol states that on December 13, 1913, CURCC approved to transfer the football section to some members under the name \"CURCC Peñarol\", exempting itself from financial or administrative operations of it. From then on, the CURCC focused on cricket exclusively, until its dissolution in 1915. Peñarol also alleges that FIFA, UEFA and CONMEBOL congratulated the club for its 120th. anniversary in 2011.\nSince the secession, the CURCC focused on cricket exclusively until the club was dissolved in 1915.\nRivalries.\nCURCC's first main rival was Albion, with which the club had the longest rivalry during late 19th century.\nAlbion was the first team CURCC played a football match, more precisely on May 25, 1892. Albion defeated CURCC by 3-2. Nevertheless, CURCC achieved a long victory in the second game vs. Albion. Then it would be discovered that two of CURCC's members, Woosey and Sagehorn, were also founders of Albion. As a result, Albion expelled them.\nBy 1896, Albion was the strongest team in Uruguay, being defeated only once after 19 matches played. Between 1897 and 1898, CURCC played against Albion 6 times, winning 2, and losing 3.\nOn March 22, 1901, Nacional' request to enter the Uruguayan Football Association was approved. Since then, the club would win many championships, becoming CURCC's (and then Peñarol) main rival.\nSymbols.\nColors.\nIn October 1829, the Rainhill Trials a competition honoring Queen Victoria was held in London. Several locomotives were exhibited in order to define which would run the Liverpool and Manchester Railway route. Although 10 locomotives were entered, only five would be tested for the competition. They were: \"Rocket\", designed by George &amp; Robert Stephenson, made in gold and black colors; Sans Pareil by Timothy Hackworth, Novelty built by Swedish John Ericsson, painted in blue and gold as the flag of Sweden; Perseverance, and Cycloped, built by Thomas Shaw Brandreth.\nThe \"Rocket\" was the only locomotive that completed the competition, therefore it was proclaimed winner. The \"Rocket\" had been painted in black (the color of coal that fueled the machine) and yellow (for King George IV). When Central Uruguay Railway began to operate in Uruguay, the club adopted the colors that identified the company.\nThe club generated influence in the election of other neighboring clubs, for example, the Club Almirante Brown of Argentina. The choice of its colors in 1912 was fortuitous, since there was no store in San Justo that had a complete set of shirts, the purchase was entrusted to one of its founding directors, Mr. Enrique Premoli, who worked In Buenos Aires city. Despite having been recommended some designs, only one house had for sale a complete set of t-shirts, with seven wide yellow-orange and black stripes on their forehead from the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club of Montevideo, the Argentine team adopting their tonalities.\nUniform.\nSince the club was established, its colors have been dark yellow and black. They were inspired in the \"Rocket\" locomotive that had been designed by George Stephenson in 1829."

Starting in 2020, six events are organized each year – men's elite, women's elite, men's under 23, women's under 23, men's under 18 (Men's Juniors), and women's under 18 (Women's Juniors). Traditionally, the elite events are held on a Sunday with the other events held on the Saturday the day before.\nThe UCI awards a gold medal and a rainbow jersey to the winner. Silver and bronze medals are awarded to the second and third place contestants. World champions wear their rainbow jersey until the following year's championship, but they may wear it only in the type of event in which they won it.\nHistory.\nFirst held in 1950 it replaced the Critérium International de Cyclo-cross (French for \"International Cyclo-cross Criterium\") which, as the first international cyclo-cross race, was considered the unofficial world championship.\nIt has since been held annually and is traditionally disputed at the end of January or the beginning of February.\nAt first there was only the event for elite men. Events for junior and under 23 men were added in 1979 and 1996 respectively; women's events were added for the elites and under 23s in 2000 and 2016 respectively.\nBeyond these, there also was an event for amateurs from 1967 till 1993.\nCyclo-cross being mostly centred in Europe has made it take quite a while for the world championships to be held in another continent.\nThis changed with the 2013 edition which took place in Louisville, Kentucky, United States."

        "title": "West Indian cricket team in England in 1988",
        "text": "The West Indian cricket team played 16 first-class cricket matches in England in 1988, under the captaincy of Viv Richards. They enjoyed considerable success during the tour, while England endured a \"disastrous summer\" of continuous change.\nEngland easily won the initial three-match One Day International (ODI) series, retaining the Texaco Trophy and raising expectations for a successful summer in the five-match Test series to follow. However, the West Indies comfortably retained the Wisden Trophy by winning the Test series 4–0. The players of the Test series were Malcolm Marshall for West Indies for his 35 wickets and Graham Gooch for England, who scored 459 runs and ended the summer as captain. \nIn Test match cricket, the captain is an important role and one which is usually relatively stable. This tour has become known in cricketing circles as the \"summer of four captains\" as England used four different captains in the five Test matches. The win set a high water mark for West Indian fortunes in Test cricket in England. The 1988 series proved to be the culmination of a 25 year run of almost uninterrupted success, but they have failed to win a single series in England in the subsequent years.\nWest Indian team.\nBy the summer of 1988, the West Indies had experienced nearly ten years as the best Test team in world cricket, including a streak of winning 10 of 11 Test series they played from 1980 to 1985–86 (the other was drawn). However, the West Indies side that had enjoyed this considerable recent success was beginning to show signs of ageing. The experienced batsmen Viv Richards (the captain), Gordon Greenidge, Jeff Dujon, and Desmond Haynes were aged 36, 37, 32, and 32 respectively at the start of the Test series, and bowlers Michael Holding and Joel Garner and batsman Larry Gomes had recently retired. As a result, the squad arrived with an inexperienced group of pace bowlers: supporting Malcolm Marshall, a veteran of 53 Tests, were relative newcomers Courtney Walsh (20 Tests), Patrick Patterson (11), Winston Benjamin (4), Curtly Ambrose (3) and Ian Bishop (0).\nThe West Indies' most recent series had been an \"epic\" 1–1 draw at home against Pakistan, but their previous two Test series against England had both resulted in 5–0 victories. The first of these, in England in 1984, was the first whitewash England had suffered since the 1920–21 season when England toured Australia, while the second occurred in the Caribbean in 1985–86. These two one-sided victories by the West Indies became known as \"blackwashes\".\nEnglish team.\nBy contrast, the English team had suffered a run of bad performances spanning several years, winning only seven of their previous 52 Tests. The England side had most recently toured Australia, drawing the Bicentennial Test and losing the only One Day International played, and New Zealand, drawing all three Test matches and sharing the ODIs 2–2. Before this, they had endured a \"hostile\" and highly controversial tour of Pakistan, during which an argument between captain Mike Gatting and umpire Shakoor Rana had led to a diplomatic incident. The three match series was lost 1–0, but the \"teasing, taunting... bemusing\" performance of leg-spinner Abdul Qadir, who took 30 wickets in three Tests, was unlikely to be repeated, given that the West Indies' only specialist spinner was Roger Harper, an off-break bowler.\nDespite having lost 5–0 to the West Indies in each of the two most recent series, England had grounds for optimism, following good performances in the shorter form of the game: the team had reached the World Cup Final the previous year, losing to Australia. Writing in the \"Daily Mirror\", Mike Bowen disparaged Gatting's captaincy, but talked up England's chances, based on their batting line-up. Gatting entered the summer as incumbent, but his position had been undermined by poor England Test performances and his on-field spat with Shakoor Rana. As such, he had been appointed captain only for the Texaco Trophy.\nEngland's \"summer of four captains\".\nAs the series unfolded, England were dominated by the West Indians in what Andrew Miller and Martin Williamson of \"ESPNcricinfo\" described as \"the crazy summer of 1988\". The cadence of the summer's contest was summed up for \"Wisden\" by Tony Cozier: \"The morale and reputation of English cricket has seldom been as severely bruised as it was during the 1988 Cornhill Insurance Test series against West Indies\".\nThe significance of there being four captains in just five Test matches can better be understood with context. The captain of a cricket team performs a vital role. Cricket captains have responsibility for strategy and tactics, and the England captain may also have an important say in team selection. Traditionally, captains of international teams are not changed frequently – for example, during the entire decade of the 1970s, only seven different men captained England, yet there were four captains in just a few weeks in the summer of 1988.\nThe many changes of captain over the summer reflected uncertainty in the English cricketing establishment as to how to respond to the drubbing the team was receiving from the West Indies; as Cozier put it, the selectors \"did not seem to know where to turn, either for a new captain or for a settled team\".\nThe England team had not suffered such uncertainty since the West Indies tour of England in 1966, where the selectors chose three different captains (Colin Cowdrey, M. J. K. Smith and Brian Close) and England lost the five-Test series 3–1. Coincidentally, Peter May was on the Board of Selectors for the 1966 series, while he was chairman of the Board of Selectors for the 1988 series.\nStatistical summary.\nBefore the Test series began, the West Indian cricket team played three One Day Internationals against England in May 1988. All of the ODIs were won by England, largely thanks to disciplined, economical bowling by Gladstone Small, Phil DeFreitas and Derek Pringle throughout and good batting performances from Gatting in the First (82*) and Third (40*) ODIs. England retained the Texaco Trophy.\nThe ODIs were followed by five Test matches. The First Test was drawn, and the remaining four Tests were all won convincingly by the West Indies.\nThe West Indies played 11 first-class matches, in addition to the five Tests,\ndefeating Somerset in May and Kent in June. The other nine first-class matches, and the First Test, were all drawn:\nSussex,\nGloucestershire,\nWorcestershire,\nLancashire,\nNorthamptonshire,\nLeicestershire,\nGlamorgan,\nNottinghamshire,\nand Essex. During the match against Gloucestershire at Bristol, immediately after the ODI series, Phil Simmons suffered a horrific injury, receiving a ball to the head from bowler David Lawrence. Not wearing a helmet, the blow caused his heart to stop and he had to be taken to hospital where he underwent emergency brain surgery. He missed the rest of the tour, but made a full recovery in time for the 1991 West Indies tour of England.\nIn addition to the One Day Internationals, there were four other non-first-class fixtures. West Indies beat Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk's XI in a 40-over match, Hampshire in a 50-over match and a combined Oxford and Cambridge Universities team over two days; they also drew with Minor Counties in a two-day match.\nJeffrey Dujon was selected as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for his performances during the 1988 season. The article in the 1989 edition said that his \"value was repeatedly emphasised\" during the 1988 series and that his performances \"invariably steadied the innings; he held twenty catches and missed little.\"\nOne Day Internationals.\nEngland won the Texaco Trophy 3–0.\n1st ODI.\nEngland omitted Eddie Hemmings, Bill Athey and Neal Radford from their squad of 14. They won the toss and elected to put the West Indies in to bat. Simmons and Greenidge made a first-wicket partnership of 34 before the former was caught by Allan Lamb off the bowling of Graham Dilley. Bowling alternate overs, Pringle and Small then dismissed Greenidge, Richards and Richie Richardson, leaving the West Indies on 72 for four. Gus Logie and Carl Hooper were restricted to singles as the England captain Gatting kept a tight in-field. Hooper made his half-century before being dismissed one run later, caught by John Emburey off the bowling of Small. Logie fell to Small 11 runs later, caught behind, with the score on 180 for six. The West Indies tail-enders provided little resistance to England, and the innings concluded with the visitors being dismissed for 217 off the last ball. \nIn reply, Graham Gooch and Chris Broad had a confident start and made an opening partnership of 70 before Broad was caught by Greenidge off Marshall's bowling. With the West Indies focus on restricting Gatting, Gooch was able to progress relatively unhindered but was dismissed for 43 by Ambrose, caught by Harper, and England were 119 for two. Then, described by Mike Selvey, writing in \"The Guardian\", as a \"loony period of kamikaze running\", Monte Lynch was run out on his debut while both Gatting and Lamb narrowly avoided a similar fate. The latter was bowled by Hooper on 11, with England then 153 for four. Gatting, partnered by Pringle, made his fifty, and guided England to the total required with two overs to spare, winning the match by six wickets. Small was named man of the match for what Selvey described as \"inspired bowling\".\n2nd ODI.\nThe second ODI, at Headingley, saw the West Indies win the toss and elect to field. They dropped Harper to play four fast bowlers, yet Gooch and Broad made a steady start, scoring 17 off the first three overs. Scyld Berry described the subsequent period of batting as \"one awful struggle against the fast bowlers\" and compared it to Test match play. When Gatting was caught by Richards off Marshall's bowling, England were 64 for two, Lynch, Lamb and Gooch all failed to make an impression as their team collapsed to 83 for five. Pringle and Paul Downton then put on a sixth-wicket partnership of 66 before the former was caught behind by Dujon. Berry noted that Richards' insistence on bowling himself denied \"his best bowlers\" six overs. Downton made 30 before falling to Bishop with England on 154 for seven, but with DeFreitas making 15, supported by Emburey and Small, England concluded their innings on 186 for eight.\nThe West Indies made a poor start to their reply, losing Simmons, Richardson and Greenidge to be 38 for three. Despite some resistance from their captain Richards, he was bowled by Small after making a quick 31, and with Logie with Lynch catching from Dilley's bowling, the visitors were 67 for five. Dujon made 12 before being bowled by Pringle, and Marshall was by Gooch for 1. Hooper made 12 before being caught leg before wicket by Pringle, and despite a 28-run ninth wicket partnership between Ambrose and Walsh, the West Indies were bowled out in the 47th over, on 139, to lose the second ODI by 47 runs. Pringle, scoring 39 with the bat and with bowling figures of 3 for 30, was named man of the match.\n3rd ODI.\nThe third ODI, at Lord's, saw Radford replace Dilley for England, the latter suffering from a \"viral complaint\". The match was disrupted several times by rain: a single ball was bowled by England, who had won the toss and elected to field, before the first weather delay of the day curtailed play. A first-wicket partnership of 40 between Greenidge and Haynes was followed by poor innings from Richardson, Logie and Richards, whose wicket fell after making 13 runs from 46 deliveries, with the West Indies on 95 for five. Hooper was then run out on 12 before the innings was brought to an early close due to poor weather, on 125 for six, with five overs remaining. The following morning, Marshall and Dujon took the attack to England and scored 53 runs in the final overs, ending the West Indies innings on 178 for seven. Gooch and Broad made a 71-run opening partnership before the former was stumped off Hooper's bowling. Broad was dismissed with England on 108 for two, but Gatting and Lynch, then Lamb, saw England reach the total with relative ease, winning by seven wickets with five overs to spare. The West Indies conceded the highest number of extras in the ODI format, conceding 42 runs mainly from leg byes and no balls. \nDeFreitas was named man of the match as England whitewashed the one-day series against the West Indies for the first time ever.\nTest matches.\nFirst Test.\nGatting was the incumbent England captain for the First Test at Trent Bridge. England won the toss and elected to bat, making 220 for five on the first day, with an opening partnership of 125 between Gooch and Broad. Marshall picked up four wickets, including England's top three, with Ambrose claiming the fifth wicket. Play was extended by thirty minutes due to the slow over rate of the West Indies. The West Indies dominated the second day, with Ambrose and Marshall taking the remaining five wickets for 22 runs, the latter taking 6 wickets for 69 runs. In reply, Greenidge and Haynes made a first-wicket partnership of 54 against the bowling of Dilley and DeFreitas, before Greenidge was caught behind from the bowling of Paul Jarvis. Richardson was then caught by Gatting off Emburey for 17. Richards entered the field and between him and Haynes, took the West Indies to 125 for two by close of play. Day three was rain-affected, with England managing to take the wickets of Richards and Haynes, but only after both had made half-centuries. Play closed early due to the inclement weather with the West Indies on 264 for 4, holding a lead of 19 with six wickets remaining. A rest day followed the third day, and on day four, the West Indies extended their lead over England. With 80 from Hooper, and an eighth-wicket partnership of 91 between Ambrose and Marshall, Richards declared on 448 for 9, a lead of 203, with less than four hours of the day's play remaining. England made slow progress for the remainder of the day, making it to 67 for one after 31 overs, with opener Gooch not out on 38. On day five, Gooch continued to dominate the West Indian bowlers, and partnered first by Gatting and then David Gower, he scored 146 as England ended the day on 301 for three and secured the draw.\nBefore the Second Test, Gatting was sacked for an alleged off-field indiscretion with a barmaid. The tabloid media made allegations of \"shenanigans\" in his room; he \"admitted taking... [her] into his room but denied anything untoward had happened\". During the previous winter, Gatting had been involved in an on-field altercation with umpire Shakoor Rana in Pakistan that snowballed into a diplomatic disaster with the third day of the second Test in Faisalabad being abandoned and accusations of cheating. His recently published autobiography \"Leading From The Front\" \"...was banned in all shops on county grounds. Gatting was good enough to lead Middlesex and England, but spectators couldn't buy his book at Lord's\". This proved to be Gatting's last match as captain. He had captained England in 23 Test matches since taking charge against India in 1986, but won only two.\nSecond Test.\nGatting was replaced as England captain by his Middlesex colleague John Emburey. Writing in \"The Guardian\", Mike Selvey suggested that \"the England captaincy at present has all the appeal and life expectancy of a South American dictatorship\" and suggested that Emburey's position was \"more tenuous than most have been at the time of their appointment\". Gatting was also dropped from the team, replaced by Yorkshire's Martyn Moxon. DeFreitas was also replaced, by Small, but the tourists were unchanged. \nThe West Indies won the toss and opted to bat first. England began the Test with \"an inspirational morning session\" of fast bowling from Dilley, who took four of the first five wickets to fall to reduce the West Indies to 54/5. At lunch on the first day, Dilley had figures of 4/35, and \"he would have taken five had Pringle at first slip caught Logie when he was 10\". Logie and Dujon settled in to score 81 and 53 respectively, as the West Indies were eventually all out for 209. In reply, England lost Broad for a duck, and ended the day on 20 for one. Moxon, Gower and Gooch all contributed to getting England up to 112 for two, but from then on, the West Indies seam bowling dominated, with Marshall taking 6/32, and with England all out on 165, helped secure a first-innings lead for the visitors of 44 runs. Greenidge and Haynes then faced 6.3 overs between them before the day's play came to a close. \nOn day three, the touring batsmen completely dominated England's bowlers, adding a further 334 runs, including a century from Greenidge and fifties from Richards and Logie. The West Indies held a 398-run with five wickets in hand as play closed for the day. During the rest day, it was confirmed that Emburey would remain as England captain for the third Test. The fourth day of the second Test match began with England's bowlers taking the remaining five wickets for 43 runs in 11 overs, with the West Indies all out for 397 which set England a target of 442 to win. Logie ended on 95 not out as he ran out of batting partners with both Ambrose and Walsh out for ducks. Other than Lamb who scored 99 not out, England's top order offered little resistance to the West Indies bowling attack, and they ended the day on 214 for seven. The final day saw good innings from a number of the England tail with Downton scoring 27, Emburey 30, Jarvis 29* and Dilley 28, but the final wicket fell soon after lunch. England were all out for 307 and lost the Test match by 134 runs.\nThird Test.\nThe England team had a different look for the third Test, with four changes to the team. The 36-year-old Essex left-arm spinner John Childs made his debut, becoming the oldest England debutant since Dick Howorth in 1947. Childs joined the recalled Gatting and DeFreitas, and newcomer David Capel. Small and Jarvis were both unavailable as a result of injury, and Pringle was dropped. Most media attention however was focused on Broad, who was also dropped, \"ostensibly for his consistent failure to make runs in home Tests, but there was always a suspicion that he was being disciplined for the incident at Lord's when he was spotted by a television camera mouthing his disappointment at an lbw decision\". For West Indies, Haynes was unfit, ending a run of 72 consecutive caps. He was replaced by the spinner Harper, and Patterson was replaced by Benjamin.\nEngland won the toss and elected to bat, and were quickly two wickets, on 14 for two. Only Gooch, Lamb and Downton offered any real resistance to the West Indian fast bowling attack, as England were bowled out for 135. No batsman scored more than 33 in England's first innings, as the four quick bowlers shared the wickets. Selvey, in \"The Guardian\", was unforgiving in his criticism: \"it was pathetic: a capitulation\" and that the \"debacle was inexcusable\". In reply, the West Indies made it to 242 for five by the end of a rain-affected second day, with Greenidge scoring 45 and Richards 47. The third day was once again affected by weather, this time in the form of hailstorms, but the West Indies increased their score to 357 for six, Dujon being the only batsman to fall throughout the day, on 67. That evening, Richards accused the English of deliberating over-watering the Old Trafford pitch so as to reduce the potency of the West Indies attack. After a rest day, the West Indies innings continued into the fourth day, afflicted by poor light. After the loss of Harper for 74, Richards declared on 384 for seven, a lead of 249. In reply, England faced just 29 overs but lost Gooch, Gatting and Moxon cheaply, ending the day's play on 60 for three. On day five, England collapsed, with only Gower make double figures while Capel and DeFreitas were dismissed without scoring. England were all out for 93, Marshall finishing with figures of 15.4–5–22–7, the best of his Test career. Extras were the third highest scorer, with 12. England were \"unable to cope for any length of time with the West Indian fast bowlers\" and never gave even a sign of competing in a one-sided affair. Two former England captains, Ted Dexter and Bob Willis, called on the chairman of selectors, Peter May, to resign.\nOn 15 July 1988, ten days after the end of the third Test, it was announced that England's third captain of the series would be Chris Cowdrey, son of Colin Cowdrey, an England captain in the 1960s. May stated: \"our performance in the series to date has been disappointing and we believe that Chris's style of leadership is what is now required\". Coincidentally, Cowdrey was May's godson, and it was expected that the appointment would last at least until the end of the series. The England selectors surprised the cricket public with their new appointment as captain, selecting a player who many believed owed his appointment more to his father than his own ability. Cowdrey was a successful captain of Kent in county cricket, but had played just five Tests previously, during the 1984–85 tour to India, captained by David Gower. He became only the second son to follow his father as captain of the England cricket team, after George Mann in the 1940s followed Frank Mann in the 1920s.\nFourth Test.\nThe England side was thoroughly shaken-up following the debacle in the Third Test at Old Trafford. The selectors tried to turn things around with seven new faces in the team, the most extensive change of an England XI during a Test series since seven players were changed for Tests in the 1921 Ashes Tests. As well as Cowdrey replacing Emburey, Gatting asked not to be considered for selection and the selectors also dropped Downton, Moxon, Capel, Defreitas and Childs in favour of Pringle, Neil Foster, Athey, Jack Richards, Tim Curtis and Robin Smith, with the last two set to make their Test debuts. For the West Indies, both Greenidge and Richardson sat the match out, injured: Haynes returned, and a debut was handed to Keith Arthurton. Jeff Dujon was promoted up the batting order as a makeshift opener.\nThe match suffered an unusual delay shortly after it began. Play \"was halted after two overs ... when the bowler's run-up at the Rugby Club End was found to be flooded ... The drains had been blocked before the Test to try to retain moisture in the square. But the Yorkshire club insisted that all drains were functioning properly by the start of the match and put the cause of the trouble on the volume of overnight rain.\" Umpires Dickie Bird and David Shepherd became involved in an exchange recalled nearly 30 years later in \"The Sunday Times\":\n“It’s wet, Shep!” Dickie shouted across to his co-umpire David Shepherd. “Well throw some sawdust on it Dickie!” Shepherd shouted back. “Sawdust? Nay lad, it’s a lake!” Dickie yelled back, and, on a ground bathed in sunshine, off they all went. “You again Bird!” barked a disgruntled spectator as the players neared the pavilion, to which Dickie famously replied: “Don’t blame me. I’m an umpire, not a plumber.”\nThe West Indies won the toss and put England in to bat. Considerable rain had fallen overnight and the start of play had to be delayed by nearly an hour because of drizzle. After just two overs, an underground leak erupted at the Rugby Stand end of Headingley, causing play to be suspended until 2:30p.m. England wickets fell regularly throughout the afternoon, leaving them at 80 for four, but an unbeaten fifth-wicket partnership between Lamb and Smith saw the day's play close with England on 137 for four. After increasing their stand to 103 on day two, Lamb was forced to retire injured, on 64 and England on 183 for four. He went to take a single before hobbling and collapsing at the bowler's end with a torn calf muscle. Smith was then caught behind and Cowdrey was out lbw without scoring. The lower order failed to provide any real resistance to the West Indian bowlers, and England were bowled out for 201. Dujon was the first to fall, followed by Hooper and Richards, while Haynes made a half-century before being trapped lbw by Pringle with the West Indies on 137 for four. Logie was then caught by Foster off a slower ball from Pringle, before rain curtailed the day's play with the West Indies on 156 for five, 45 runs behind England. \nRain delayed the start of the third day, with play not possible until 2:45p.m. and in the two hours of play before the inclement weather returned, the West Indies were on 238 for eight with Harper on 31. He completed his half-century on day four before being the last wicket to fall, the West Indies being 275 all out with a lead of 74. Gooch and Curtis put on an opening stand of 56 before the latter was bowled by Ambrose. After making his half-century, Gooch was caught by Hooper off the bowling of Walsh with England 80 for two. England then collapsed, losing their remaining wickets for 58 more runs, including 19 from Lamb who played despite carrying his injury. All out on a total of 138, England held a lead of 47 going into the final day. Just 26 minutes into day five, the West Indies made their target without loss, winning the match by ten wickets and taking an unassailable 3–0 lead in the series into the fifth and final Test. Cowdrey suggested the defeat was in part directly as a result of the loss of Lamb mid-partnership with Smith: \"you need partnerships to put pressure on [the West Indian bowlers], for as soon as you lose a wicket, they raise their game\".\nFifth Test.\nThe England selectors turned to 35-year-old Graham Gooch, stalwart opening batsman, as their fourth captain of the series, for the Fifth Test at The Oval. England also replaced Cowdrey with DeFreitas, dropped Gower for Matthew Maynard, and replaced the injured Allan Lamb with Rob Bailey, a recall and two Test debuts respectively. The tourists replaced the youngster Arthurton with Greenidge, who had recovered from an injury.\nEngland won the toss and elected to bat, with Gooch receiving the first ball, but the new captain was the first wicket to fall with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play from Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) was followed by some mediocre scores from the middle- and lower-order batsmen. The West Indian off spinner Harper took three wickets, being the first England wickets to fall to spin during the summer. England then collapsed again and lost six wickets for 83 runs to end the day on 203 for nine. Just two more runs were added on the second day as Marshall had Foster caught off the third ball of the day, his 34th wicket of the series. After nine overs, the West Indies had collapsed to 16 for three with Foster taking the wickets of Haynes, Greenidge and Richards. Logie and Dujon then steadied the innings, taking the score to 155 for five but the tail-enders offered little resistance. Losing their last five wickets for 28 runs, the West Indies were all out for 183. England started their second innings with a lead of 22, with Gooch and Curtis making a 50-run opening partnership before the latter was out lbw. Bailey and Smith both fell with the score on 55, and play ended for the day with Gooch unbeaten on 38 and England on 64 for three, 86 ahead of the West Indies. Foster, the nightwatchman, and Gooch completed a 50-run partnership on the morning of day three before the former was caught by Logie off Benjamin's bowling. Gooch remained at the crease for almost the whole innings, described by Scyld Berry writing in \"The Observer\" as \"one of the most famous by an England captain in recent years\". His was the last wicket to fall, caught by Greenidge off Ambrose, for a seven-hour 84, and England were all out for 202, a lead of 224. In reply, the West Indies made an unbeaten start, with Greenidge making a half-century and his side ended the day on 71 without loss, requiring 154 runs for victory. Gooch's Test match ended with a trip to hospital to address a dislocated finger sustained while he fielded at slip. After a rest day, the West Indies resumed their run chase and a first-wicket partnership of 131 came to an end when Greenidge was out for 77, caught behind off Childs' bowling. Hooper made 23 before being bowled by Foster but Logie (38*) and the opener Haynes (77*) secured the victory by eight wickets with more than a day of the Test match to spare, and ensured a 4–0 series victory for the West Indies.\nAftermath.\nGooch had enjoyed a successful series against West Indies as a batsman, named 'Man of the series' for England. He remained in charge for England's next match, against Sri Lanka at Lord's later in the 1988 season, in which he achieved his first victory as captain. Gooch was appointed captain for the 1988–89 tour of India, which was cancelled after India refused visas to eight players who had played in South Africa, and he was replaced as captain in summer 1989 by a new England management team, who reappointed David Gower for the six-match Ashes series at home against Australia. England lost 4–0, bringing Gower's long captaincy career to a close. When a \"rebel\" England tour of South Africa (breaking the sporting boycott of South Africa) was announced, a number of candidates for captain were removed from the picture, as those who joined the tour, captained by Gatting, were banned from regular international cricket.\nGooch was reappointed England captain for the tour to West Indies in the winter of 1989–90 and remained in that position until 1993. Personally, he achieved great success: for much of this period, he was also rated as one of the world's leading batsmen. \nEngland's fortunes under Gooch revived. With so many potential players banned from the side, England took a new-look team to West Indies in 1989–90, and won the first Test, their first victory over the West Indies in Test cricket since 1974. Gooch's hand was broken by fast bowler Ezra Moseley and he missed the rest of the series. Understudy Allan Lamb lost both of his matches in charge and England lost the series, but had performed creditably: Wisden reported \"The truth of the matter is that at worst they merited a shared series, and at best an unimaginable upset of the world champions of Test Cricket.\" The 1991 home series, yet again versus West Indies, was a hard-fought 2–2 draw, and, in one-day cricket, England reached the World Cup final for the second successive time the following winter, losing to Pakistan. Away from home, though, England were not so strong, losing heavily to Australia in 1990–91 and to India and Sri Lanka in 1992–93, though these were either side of a series victory in New Zealand.\nThe West Indies team's next opposition was Australia where the team enjoyed a 3–1 Test series win on foreign soil, their only defeat in that series coming on a pitch friendly to spin bowling in which 11 wickets were taken by the occasional left-arm spin of Allan Border. \"The West Indians made a slow start to their tour, losing twice to Western Australia before running into form... So effectively, at times irresistibly, did Vivian Richards's West Indian side play in the first three Test matches in Australia that by the New Year they had already retained the Frank Worrell Trophy.\"\nThe West Indies went on to record further Test series victories in the next two years, defeating India 3–0 in a four-Test series in the Caribbean in 1988–89, and narrowly beating England once again in the Caribbean in 1989–90. However, the team's long period of pre-eminence was coming to an end. For several of their senior players, the 1991 tour of England was a swansong: Richards, Marshall and Dujon all retired from Tests after the final match, while Greenidge, after 108 Tests, had announced his intention to do likewise but was forced out of the tour by injury before the Tests began, and Logie also played his last of his 52 Tests on the tour. Nevertheless, the West Indies were to remain unbeaten in a Test series for a few more years yet, but never as dominant as they had been: and their 2–1 home defeat by Australia in 1994–95 saw the West Indies relinquish the mantle as the World's best Test cricket side to their visitors, and by the time that the International Cricket Council launched the official Test rankings in 2001, the West Indies were rated as the sixth best team in the world. \nIn one way, the 1988 series was a watershed. The 4–0 win in 1988 was the fifth series win in succession for West Indies on English soil, a run stretching back to 1973, and part of a longer series of seven wins out of eight stretching back to 1963. Since then, West Indies have failed to win another series in England, with defeats in 2000, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2017 and 2020, and drawn series in 1991 and 1995. On home turf, West Indies continued their domination until the new millennium, since when West Indies have won twice, England once and there has been one drawn series."

        "text": "Power cycling is the act of turning a piece of equipment, usually a computer, off and then on again. Reasons for power cycling include having an electronic device reinitialize its set of configuration parameters or recover from an unresponsive state of its mission critical functionality, such as in a crash or hang situation. Power cycling can also be used to reset network activity inside a modem. It can also be among the first steps for troubleshooting an issue.\nOverview.\nPower cycling can be done manually, usually using a switch on the device to be cycled; automatically, through some type of device, system, or network management monitoring and control; or by remote control; through a communication channel.\nIn the data center environment, remote control power cycling can usually be done through a power distribution unit, over TCP/IP. In the home environment, this can be done through home automation powerline communications or IP protocols. Most Internet Service Providers publish a \"how-to\" on their website showing their customers the correct procedure to power cycle their devices.\nPower cycling is a standard diagnostic procedure usually performed first when the computer freezes. However, frequently power cycling a computer can cause thermal stress. Reset has an equal effect on the software but may be less problematic for the hardware as power is not interrupted.\nHistorical uses.\nOn all Apollo missions to the moon, the landing radar was required to acquire the surface before a landing could be attempted. But on Apollo 14, the landing radar was unable to lock on. Mission control told the astronauts to cycle the power. They did, the radar locked on just in time, and the landing was completed.\nDuring the Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, the Philae lander did not return the expected telemetry on awakening after arrival at the comet. The problem was diagnosed as \"somehow a glitch in the electronics\", engineers cycled the power, and the lander awoke correctly.\nDuring the launch of the billion dollar AEHF-6 satellite on 26 March 2020 by an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, a hold was called at T-46 seconds due to hydraulic system not responding as expected. The launch crew turned it off and back on, and the launch proceeded normally.\nIn 2023 the Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft stopped responding to commands after an anomaly. When gentler techniques failed, NASA resorted to rebooting the spacecraft with the remote equivalent of a power cycle."

        "title": "Baseball and Bloomers",
        "text": "Baseball and Bloomers, also known as Baseball in Bloomers, is a 1911 American silent short sports film produced by the Thanhouser Company. The film stars William Garwood and is the debut of Marguerite Snow. The film focuses on a female seminary which organizes a baseball club and challenges another school to a game. The boys accept to the game with amusement and find that the women are not good at baseball. Two Harvard University baseball stars join the ranks of the girls in disguise and defeat the boys team. The script may have been written by Lloyd Lonergan and the film may have been directed by Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. The film was released on January 6, 1911 and it received positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.\nPlot.\nThough the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in \"The Moving Picture World\" from January 7, 1911. It states, \"Miss Street's Seminary for Girls has a very ambitious class of pupils. The young athletes, not content with basketball and tennis, aspire to shine in the great American game, and organize a baseball club. They are so satisfied with themselves that they finally send a challenge to Adair College, which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club that thinks it amounts to something. When the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, to have fun with the girls. The young women, after some practice, realize that their team, while it may be pretty to look at, is of little real use on the diamond. And the prospect makes them weep. Fortunately for the girls, Jack, the brother of the president, arrives from Harvard. His chum, Jim, is with him. These two young men are baseball stars themselves, and when they are told of the predicament of the girls, they goodnaturedly offer to help them out. The university men disguise themselves as girls, act as battery for the young women, and the college boys, who had looked for a laughable victory, are mowed down, inning after inning, because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim. The other members of the 'girl' team have nothing to do except look pretty. When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished, the girls reward their battery with one kiss - only one - from each of the other seven players.\"\nProduction.\nThe writer of the scenario was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by \"The New York Evening World\" while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions though cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Alfred H. Moses, Jr. and Carl Louis Gregory. The other cast credits are unknown, but many Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, and Mrs. George Walters.\nThis film is important for being the debut of Marguerite Snow, who would become one of the most important actresses for the company. In an interview by Johnson Briscoe, Snow said that her career as an actress was an accidental one. A girl friend of hers suggested she come to the studio to see how motion pictures are made. There at the studio, Edwin Thanhouser asked her if she wanted to be in the film. Snow accepted and she took part in the production until the director asked them to go outside to shoot another scene. Snow then protested about going outside in such a costume and in winter and proceeded home. A week later she received a phone call and ended up working for six more months before temporarily returning to the stage. Another baseball related film would be released later that year by the Thanhouser Company, \"The Baseball Bug\".\nRelease and reception.\nThe single reel comedy, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on January 6, 1911. The film had a wide national release; advertising theaters are known in Indiana, North Carolina, South Dakota, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Texas. In Arizona, the film would be advertised by one theatre as \"Baseball Bloomers\" and it appears to also have been the case in another Kansas theater. The film would also be shown in Hawaii in August 1912.\n\"The New York Dramatic Mirror\" gave a brief summary and review of the film and gave minor praise for the production. The reviewer wrote, \"The details of this comedy are well worked out, and it is good for a portion of genuine laughs. The girls of Miss Street's Seminary become so elated over their success in the gymnasium that they feel impelled to branch out, and accordingly they challenge the boys of Adair College to a game of ball. At the last moment the girls feel like backing out, when two of Cornell's star baseball players arrive in town. They agree to pitch and catch for the girls, who give them bloomers and rats from their hair for disguise. At the eighth inning the score was 0 to 0. By the ninth it was 0 to 2, in favor of Miss Street's Seminary for Girls. The nine girls then showed their gratitude by giving the pitcher and catcher a round of kisses, while the Adair College boys stood off at a respectful distance. The actors were equal to the occasion.\" \"The Billboard\" affirmed by stating, \"Thanhouser producers have again placed a picture of originality on the market in \"Baseball and Bloomers\". It is a farce pure and simple, but it offers many laughable situations. The acting is generally good, but in a few instances scenes were overacted.\""

        "text": "Gerald Hundley Moore (born July 18, 1939) is a former American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at North Texas State University—now the University of North Texas—from 1979 to 1980, at Texas Tech University from 1981 to 1985, and at Appalachian State University from 1989 to 2012, compiling a career college football coaching record of 242–134–2.\nIn his 24 years at Appalachian State, Moore posted a losing season only once. He led his 2005 Mountaineers team to the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship. This was the first national championship for any college football team in the state of North Carolina. Moore and the Mountaineers repeated as champions in 2006 and 2007, achieving the first \"three-peat\" in NCAA Division I FCS/I-AA history. Moore was forced out as head coach at the conclusion of the 2012 season. He was selected for inclusion into the Southern Conference Hall of Fame, and College Football Hall of Fame in 2014.\nPlaying career.\nMoore played wide receiver for the Baylor Bears. He was coached by Sam Boyd in 1958 and John Bridgers in 1959 and 1960. Moore captained the 1960 Gator Bowl team that ended the year as the nation's eleventh-ranked squad.\nMoore received degrees from Baylor University in finance and economics.\nCoaching career.\nMoore began his coaching career at Corsicana High School under Texas high school coach Jim Acree. In 1965, he became assistant coach at SMU. After the 1972 season, he joined the Nebraska Cornhuskers as receivers coach, becoming offensive coordinator under coach Tom Osborne in 1978.\nIn 1979, at North Texas State (now North Texas), Moore got his first head coaching job. After two seasons he left North Texas for Texas Tech, where he spent five seasons and garnered a record of 16–37–2 before being replaced by David McWilliams. After three years away from football, Moore joined the coaching staff at Arkansas where he remained for two seasons before taking the head coaching position at Appalachian State in 1989.\nDuring his tenure of twenty-four years as head coach at Appalachian State, Moore led the Mountaineers to ten Southern Conference championships and three consecutive NCAA Division I-AA national championships (2005, 2006, and 2007). The 215 ASU victories under his leadership is a school record.\nOn September 1, 2007, Moore led Appalachian State to score one of the biggest upsets in college football history, defeating the then fifth-ranked Michigan Wolverines 34–32 at Michigan Stadium. The win over Michigan has been regarded the greatest upset of all time in college football history. This marked the first time a team in a lower subdivision defeated a ranked team in a higher subdivision. It was also the first game and loss for Michigan against a Division I FCS team. Moore had learned the spread offensive scheme that enabled him to defeat Michigan from then-West Virginia coach Rich Rodriguez, whom Michigan hired to succeed Lloyd Carr the following season.\nMoore became the 28th head coach in Division I history to reach 200 wins after the Mountaineers defeated the Furman Paladins on October 25, 2008.\nOn December 2, 2012, after a first round home playoff loss to Illinois State, athletics director Charlie Cobb announced that Moore would not return for the 2013 season. According to a press release issued by the ASU athletic department, Cobb stated that he and Moore agreed after the end of the 2011 season that the 2012 season would be Moore's last as head coach, but chose not to make an announcement until that time. However, several days later, Moore claimed that there had been a communication gap, and that he had wanted to coach for one more season in 2013. Cobb announced that assistant head coach Scott Satterfield, who played quarterback under Moore at Appalachian from 1993 to 1995 and served as an assistant at ASU from 1998 to 2008, would serve as interim head coach while a national coaching search was conducted. Satterfield was given the permanent job on December 14, 2012.\nLegacy.\nFollowing the 2012 season Coach Moore remained in Boone and had distance from the program. Appalachian State moved up to the Football Bowl Subdivision in 2014 and joined the Sun Belt Conference. The program saw continued success and the hiring of Doug Gillin as the new athletic director to replace outgoing Cobb. Gillin and the coaching staff rekindled the relationship with Moore. Since then Moore is often involved with current athletic events with the Mountaineers Athletic Fund &amp; Yosef Club and activity speaks with the current players and staff. He is credited setting the foundation of Appalachian State Football. Moore is known for the phrase \"Always do more than is expected\", which is used by many coaches from his coaching tree around the southeast. Baylor University selected Moore for the Baylor Football's Hall of Fame’s Wall of Honor — which recognizes graduates for their accomplishments in public or private life in 2013. Moore was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and the Southern Conference Hall of Fame in 2014. Coach Moore was inducted into the Appalachian State University Hall of Fame in 2015 alongside Armanti Edwards, the quarterback that led his team to 2 of the 3 national championships and a historic win over Michigan in 2007. In 2018 Moore was awarded The Order of the Long Leaf Pine, North Carolina's highest honor for service to the state. In 2019 Appalachian State University Direct of Athletics Doug Gillin announced they would be honoring Hall of Fame football coach Jerry Moore with a plaza and statue in his name outside the Kidd Brewer Stadium north end zone facility. The plaza and statue were dedicated on September 18, 2021, just prior to the first home game of the 2021 season."

He served as the head football coach at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1970 to 1977, compiling a record of 37–47–3. Jardine's best season came in 1974, when his Wisconsin Badgers went 7–4 and placed fourth in the Big Ten Conference. Noteworthy was the Badgers' 21–20 victory over the perennial powerhouse Nebraska during the second week of the season.\nJardine was a graduate of Purdue University where he was a starting guard in 1956 and 1957. He began his coaching career at Central Catholic High School in Lafayette, Indiana in 1958, then moved to the head coaching job at Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois. Jardine's five teams at Fenwick produced an overall 51–6–1 record and the Friars played in the Chicago Catholic League title game in 1959, 1961, and 1962. His 1962 squad was undefeated, winning the Chicago city title.\nJardine left the prep ranks following the 1963 season, returning to Purdue as an offensive line coach under Jack Mollenkopf. He coached the guards and centers and recruited the Chicago area. He then served as offensive line coach under Tommy Prothro at UCLA from 1965 to 1969.\nJardine became Wisconsin's head football coach on December 22, 1969 after North Dakota State athletic director and head football coach Ron Erhardt declined a firm offer to accept the position."

        "text": "The Rugby–Birmingham–Stafford line (also known as the Birmingham loop) is a railway line in the West Midlands of England. It is a loop off the West Coast Main Line (WCML) between Rugby and Stafford, via the West Midlands cities of Coventry, Birmingham and Wolverhampton. The direct route between Rugby and Stafford is the Trent Valley line.\nPlaces served.\nThese cities, towns and villages are served by the line:\nServices.\nA mixture of intercity, regional, cross-country and local services operate over all or parts of the route. Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains all operate services.\nHistory.\nThe line was built in three parts, between 1837 and 1852:\nThe LNWR itself became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, and part of British Railways during Nationalisation in 1948.\nThe line was electrified along with the rest of the WCML during the late 1960s in the wake of the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan.\nIn 1987, British Rail commissioned artist Kevin Atherton to produce a series of sculptures to be erected along the line between Birmingham New Street station and Wolverhampton. The finished piece was titled \"Iron Horse\", and consists of twelve different horse silhouettes, fashioned from steel. The construction material was chosen for its historic associations with the Black Country.\nMany of the smaller stations on the line were closed in the 1950s and 60s, especially between Birmingham and Wolverhampton. However, some new stations were opened in the late 20th century: station was opened in 1976 to serve Birmingham Airport and the National Exhibition Centre, and in 1995 another new station; was opened, serving as a two-level interchange with trains on the Birmingham Snow Hill to Worcester Line.\nThere were also three services a day to Walsall, until a timetable change in May 2019 saw it removed and replaced by two morning services per day to Shrewsbury.\nInfrastructure.\nDespite the heavy traffic carried by the line, it is only double track throughout, and heavily congested, especially between Coventry and Birmingham. In the 1930s, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) started work on quadrupling the line between Coventry and Birmingham, however only preparatory work was carried out before the scheme was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II. Periodic calls have been made since to quadruple the line between Coventry and Birmingham to ease congestion.\nThe line is electrified with overhead wires at AC.\nFuture proposals.\nIn 2023, Transport for West Midlands (TfWM) and the West Midlands Rail Executive (WMRE) put forward plans to open a new station at Binley on the line between Coventry and Rugby named \"Coventry East (Binley)\", serving the eastern part of Coventry."

        "title": "Royal Dutch Cricket Association",
        "text": "The Royal Dutch Cricket Association (Dutch: Koninklijke Nederlandse Cricket Bond; KNCB) is the governing body of cricket in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It was formed in 1890 and received a Royal charter in 1958. The KNCB is responsible for the national men's and women's teams, and also for the various domestic competitions, including the Topklasse (Division One) and Hoofdklasse (Division Two) leagues, and the Dutch Twenty20 Cup. The KNCB has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council since 1966. It is one of the oldest national governing bodies in the sport, older than those of many full ICC members. The KNCB is also a member of the ICC Europe (succeeding the European Cricket Council), which organises the European Cricket Championship.\nOverview.\nKoninklijke Nederlandse Cricket Bond is an administrative organization responsible for the promotion, development, and organization of the sport of cricket in the Netherlands. It controls the men's national team, and the women's national team teams. The women's national team currently have Test status and played their first Test match in 2007. A total of 57 cricket clubs take part in the domestic season, which include the Hoofdklasse, Topklasse and the region T20 cricket.\nHistory.\nCricket was first seen being played on Dutch soil in the 1780s by an English traveller in Scheveningen, and by the turn of the 20th century, Dutch teams were touring England regularly. Cricket was one of the most popular sports in the Netherlands in the 19th century, surpassed since by many other sports, most notably association football. Cricket even found enough of a following to survive the German occupation of the country between May 1940 and May 1945. The sport, famously dismissed as \"unmanly and un-German\" and \"insufficiently violent\" by Adolf Hitler himself, endured thanks in no small part to the dogged enthusiasm of local players, who shrugged off the requisitioning of grounds and restrictions on weekend travel – not to mention the presence of thousands of heavily armed Nazis and the bombing of the main sports dealers in Rotterdam – to organise as many as 300 matches a year.\nThe KNCB has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council since 1966. There are a few cricket grounds in the Netherlands which are officially sanctioned by the ICC to host ODIs such as Amstelveen, Rotterdam and Voorburg. It hosted one of the matches of the 1999 Cricket World Cup, though the Dutch did not participate in that tournament.\nThe Dutch participated in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, 2003 Cricket World Cup, 2007 Cricket World Cup, and 2011 Cricket World Cup. In their debut campaign, they lost all of their matches barring a respectful performance against England. They qualified for the 2003 edition after winning the 2001 ICC Trophy, with their only win of the World Cup tournament coming against fellow qualifier Namibia. It was around this time that stars and excellent cricketers like Ronald Lefebvre and Ryan ten Doeschate started emerging to make Dutch cricket much more strong.\nPresent day.\nThe Dutch qualified for the 2007 World Cup with a fifth-place finish at the 2005 ICC Trophy. The Dutch struggled in the tournament, losing their first two games, with South African Herschelle Gibbs notably hitting Daan van Bunge for six sixes in an over. They did recover to beat Scotland by eight wickets in their last game. After failing to qualify for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, they qualified for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, where they shocked host England at Lord's.\nAfter years of stagnation, the women's game is also developing rapidly in the Netherlands. Recently, the women's team outshone the men's team and they were given Test cricket status by the ICC in 2007 unlike their male counterparts. They played their inaugural Test match against South Africa Women in 2007.\nThe Dutch men's team qualified for the 2011 Cricket World Cup by coming third in the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier. Although they lost all of their matches, the Dutch gave England a fright in Nagpur, where Ryan ten Doeschate smashed 119 runs. The result was 292 - 296/4. \n2010 turned out to be a memorable year for Dutch cricket as they defeated two Test-playing nations, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.\nThe Netherlands cricket team participated in the Intercontinental Cup and Intercontinental Cup One-Day while the women's team won the 2011 Women's European Championship Twenty20. More recently, they participated in the 2011 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier where they came third in Group A, thus gaining both ODI Status and World Cup participation.\nName change.\nBefore 1958 the KNCB was known as the Nederlandse Cricket Bond or the Dutch Cricket Board. After receiving a Royal charter in 1958, a ’Royal’ was added before the board's name known simply as Koninklijke in Dutch. The following names have been for the board in their history:-\nCompetitions.\nAs well as maintaining Dutch international sides, the KNCB is also responsible for managing the regional domestic competitions. The following domestic competitions are organized in the Netherlands:-\nIn addition, a number of youth programs as well as women's programs are organized in the Netherlands.\nSponsorship.\nIn recent years NORDEK and Fairtree have been substantial supporters of Dutch cricket in general and the men's team in particular.\nSISAR B.V. became the first official sponsor of the Dutch women's cricket team in December 2022. SISAR B.V. signed a sponsorship contract for three years with the KNCB. \nIn earlier years, sponsors included Amul as the official sponsor of the Dutch cricket team during the 2011 Cricket World Cup. and leading Dutch bank ABN AMRO."

        "text": "The Ireland men's national field hockey team is organised by Hockey Ireland and represents both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in international men's field hockey competitions, including the Men's Hockey World Cup and the EuroHockey Nations Championship. They have previously competed in the Men's Intercontinental Cup, the Hockey Champions Challenge, the Men's FIH Hockey World League and the FIH Hockey Series. The team also competes at the Summer Olympics, though it officially only represents the Republic of Ireland then (using the Republic's flag and national anthem), while still selecting players from the entire island. On 26 January 1895 Ireland played in the first ever international field hockey match when they defeated Wales 3–0 in Rhyl. Ireland were finalists and silver medallists at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Ireland were also bronze medallists at the 2015 Men's EuroHockey Nations Championship.\nEarly years.\nThe Irish Hockey Union was founded on 6 February 1893 and on 26 January 1895 Ireland played in the first ever international field hockey match when they defeated Wales 3–0 in Rhyl. In 1895 Ireland also played England for the first time. This was also England's first ever international field hockey match. England's first four international matches, in 1895, 1896, 1897 and 1898, were all against Ireland. By the start of the First World War, Ireland had played 55 international matches, mostly against Wales, England or Scotland. This saw 605 individuals represent Ireland, at least 164 of whom were brothers. Amongst the most notable set of brothers were the Petersons, including Jack and Walter. In 1904 the Peterson brothers were members of the Ireland team that won the Triple Crown. Ireland won the title after defeating Wales 4–2 away and England 3–2 at home. As well as Jack and Walter, the team also included their brothers Nicholas, William and Cecil. Another brother, Herbert made two Ireland appearances between 1900 and 1902. In total the brothers won 66 caps between them.\nTournament history.\nOlympic Games.\nIn 1908, with a team that included Jack and Walter Peterson, Ireland played in the very first Olympic field hockey tournament. After defeating Wales 3–1 in the semi-final, they lost 8–1 to England in the final. The Ireland team was part of the Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics team. Because of this, the silver medal won by Ireland is credited to Great Britain and not Ireland. Ireland would have to wait 108 years before competing in their next Olympic tournament. In 1980 Ireland were invited to enter the tournament after a number of teams dropped out following the boycott. However the offer was turned down by the Irish Hockey Union due to the short notice. Shortly after it was proposed that Ireland apply to enter in 1984. However following a meeting on 16 May 1980 it was rejected due to opposition from the Ulster Branch. Ireland have entered Olympic qualifying tournaments since 1992. After narrowly missing out on qualification in both 2008 and 2012, Ireland qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics after finishing fifth in the 2014–15 Men's FIH Hockey World League Semifinals.

        "text": "Ligat HaAl (, lit., \"Supreme League or Premier League\"), or the Israeli Basketball Premier League, is the top-tier level league of professional competition in Israeli club basketball, making it Israel's primary basketball competition. The league's name is abbreviated as either BSL (Basketball Super League) or ISBL (Israeli Basketball Super League). For sponsorship reasons, the league is also referred to as Ligat Winner Sal (), lit. \"Winner Basket League\", with \"Winner\" being the name of a game operated by the league's primary sponsor, Toto Winner.\nThe league is run by the Israeli Basketball Super League Administration Ltd.\nOverview.\nLigat HaAl comprises the top 12 basketball clubs in Israel, and was founded in 1954.\nThe league itself is most known in Europe, due to the success of the Israeli teams in European-wide competitions, such as the EuroLeague, EuroCup (formerly called the ULEB Cup), and FIBA's EuroChallenge (formerly called the FIBA EuroCup). Many non-drafted and free agent players from Europe and the NBA play in the Israeli league, as an alternative to NBA competition.\nThe league is the first division in Israeli basketball: the team that finishes last in a season is relegated to the Second Division, while the Second Division's top 8 teams compete in a play-off system right after the end of the regular season, with the team that reaches the finals series being promoted to the Premier League for the following season.\nFormat.\nThere are 12 teams in the league, and they play against each other three times a season. The top eight teams advance to the five-game series Quarter-finals. The winners of the Quarter-finals advance to the Final Four.\nLinks with the NBA.\nIn the 1980s and the early 1990s, the Israeli League stars played in Israel against the Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, Orlando Magic, and Los Angeles Lakers.\nIn October 2005, Maccabi Tel Aviv defeated the Toronto Raptors 105–103 in an exhibition game played in Toronto, Canada; this was the first victory for any European or Israeli team over an NBA team on its home court.\nOver the years, many of its players joined the NBA. In 2009, Omri Casspi became the first Israeli-born NBA player with the Sacramento Kings. Prior to that, three players were drafted: Doron Sheffer (who played U.S. college basketball at Connecticut), Yotam Halperin and Lior Eliyahu. Oded Kattash agreed to play with the New York Knicks, but he never played in the NBA because of the 1998–99 NBA lockout that started on July 1, 1998.\nIn the 2009 NBA draft, Omri Casspi was selected 23rd overall by the Sacramento Kings, and Gal Mekel followed in 2013 by signing with Dallas Mavericks. In 2016, Dragan Bender became the highest selection from the Israeli Basketball Premier League to be selected in an NBA draft with the Phoenix Suns taking him at 4th overall. Other players who have moved from the league to the NBA include: Will Bynum, Anthony Parker, Joe Ingles, Roger Mason Jr., P. J. Tucker, Eugene \"Pooh\" Jeter, Elijah Bryant, Carlos Arroyo, and Nate Robinson.\nIn 2016, Amar'e Stoudemire retired from the NBA. However, on August 1, 2016, he signed a two-year deal with Hapoel Jerusalem, a team he co-owns. On October 1, 2016, he helped Hapoel Jerusalem win the 2016 Israeli Basketball League Cup. He also played for Maccabi Tel Aviv during the 2019–20 season, helping them win the 2019–20 Israeli Basketball Premier League championship. He was named MVP of the championship game.\nIn 2020 two players declared for the NBA draft. The first being Deni Avdija from Maccabi Tel Aviv and the second being Yam Madar from Hapeol Tel Aviv. Avdija was selected in the first round, 9th overall, by the Washington Wizards, and Madar was taken in the second round with the 47th pick of the draft by the Boston Celtics.\nHigh-profile American Jewish recruits.\nIn 2011, the league imposed a limit of four non-Israelis per team. However, as all Jews are immediately eligible for Israeli citizenship under Israel's Law of Return, non-Israeli Jewish basketball players are able to join a team in the league without using up one of the few roster spots available for non-Israeli players.\nExamples of Jewish Americans joining teams in the league include Jon Scheyer, Jordan Farmar, Sylven Landesberg, David Blu, Amar'e Stoudemire, and Dan Grunfeld."

Upon the merger with \"Sport Lisboa\" in 1908, a cycling department established within the new Sport Lisboa e Benfica, and along with football, is one of only two sports referenced in the club's logo. The sport was in activity from 1906 to 1941, 1947 to 1978, 1999 to 2000, and once again for two seasons in 2007 and 2008.\nIn 1931 the Portuguese cycling legend José Maria Nicolau won the Volta a Portugal and helped Benfica to win the Volta as a team. Benfica won the Volta once again in 1932. In 1934, Benfica won the Volta for the third time with Nicolau being the overall winner, beating his rival Alfredo Trindade from Sporting of Lisbon.\nAfter some years without success, Benfica won another Volta as a team in 1939. The benfiquistas had to wait until 1947 (due to the end of the cycling section in 1941) to see once again one of their cyclists winning the Volta. It was José Martins, who also helped Benfica to win the Volta as a team.\nIn 1963, Benfica won its sixth Volta a Portugal, but had to wait two more years to see a Benfica cyclist winning the Volta. It was Peixoto Alves, who was succeeded by Francisco Valada one year later and another team win.\nIn 1968 Américo Silva won the Volta, but Benfica failed to win it as a team.\nThat happened in 1974, when Benfica won its eighth Volta (and due to the cycling section's end in 1978 the last one for a long time) and its cyclist Fernando Mendes the seventh individual Volta for Benfica. Two years later, in 1976, Firmino Bernardino won the last Volta for Benfica before its end in 1978.\nIt was the Spanish cyclist David Plaza, the first foreigner to win a Volta for Benfica, who won the last individual Volta for Benfica in 1999. It was the same year that Benfica won its ninth and so far last Volta a Portugal. Another Spanish Benfica cyclist, Melcior Mauri, won the Volta ao Algarve.\nIn 2007, the newly created Benfica cycling team around superstar José Azevedo ended the 2007–2008 UCI Europe Tour in 27th with 622 points.\nIn 2008, Rubén Plaza won the Vuelta a Valencia.\nTitles.\nInternational.\n2007-08 UCI Europe Tour Teams Results\n2007-08 UCI Europe Tour Individual Wins"

        "title": "WWF Royal Rumble (2000 video game)",
        "text": "WWF Royal Rumble is a professional wrestling video game released in 2000 for arcades and the Dreamcast. THQ published the title for the Dreamcast while Sega released it for arcades. It is based on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) professional wrestling promotion and its yearly Royal Rumble event. This game took its influence from the event's 2000 edition. Yuke's, creators of the \"WWF SmackDown! series\", developed \"Royal Rumble\", which had several unique features including support for up to nine wrestlers on the screen simultaneously.\nThe Dreamcast version was released to mixed reviews that faulted its small roster and lack of gameplay modes.\nGameplay.\nThe game has two modes, Exhibition and Royal Rumble. In Exhibition mode, the player chooses a wrestler along with a partner and wrestles a series of singles matches. The player's partner can interfere on the player's behalf on command. These partner moves can be used any number of times during the match, but must be recharged before they can be used again. The object of each match is to wear down the opponent using various attacks and grappling maneuvers, decreasing their life bar before ending the match by pinfall or knockout.\nRoyal Rumble mode involves a multi-wrestler match in which the player must eliminate a certain number of opponents from the match within a time limit by sending them over the top rope and onto the floor. Eliminating opponents adds more time to the player's clock; eliminating larger wrestlers offers a higher time bonus. Due to size of the game's roster, wrestlers appear multiple times in the same Royal Rumble match.\nEach player has a super meter that fills up during the course of the match. When it fills up, the player receives an \"S\" icon, which can be used to instantly recover from pin attempts in Exhibition mode or re-enter the ring during a Royal Rumble match.\nThis was Big Show's only video game appearance with the 2000 roster, as he was removed from \"\" and \"WWF No Mercy\" due to his demotion to Ohio Valley Wrestling. Coincidentally, he returned at the following year's Royal Rumble. Kurt Angle and Tazz (who debuted in a match against Angle on the 2000 edition of the titular pay-per-view) made their first WWF video game debuts in this game, before \"No Mercy\" and \"SmackDown! 2\".\nReception.\nThe Dreamcast version received \"average\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\nOne of the biggest criticisms was of the small number of playable characters, which \"IGN\" called \"paper thin\" and \"GameSpot\"s Jeff Gerstmann called confining. The game's lack of modes was also criticized. \"IGN\" recommended other Japanese Dreamcast wrestling titles such as \"Toukon Retsuden\" and \"Giant Gram\" over \"Royal Rumble\". The earliest review came from PlanetDreamcast, which gave it a low score of four out of ten over a month before the game was released. Daniel Erickson of \"NextGen\" said that the game is neither deep nor revolutionary but overall fun. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 30 out of 40."

The Cardiac 8+ was a small group of men who had previously rowed in college and continued to row on Sunday mornings. That group of men, including Olympian Dick Draeger, held the facility and equipment together.\nIn 1977, U.C. Berkeley rower Jana Barto began a high school program for women from Redwood High School, and in 1982 Olympian Lou Lindsey joined Coach Cumming to run the men's team, taking over in 1984 after the death of Coach Cumming.\nToday both the boys and girls teams, recruiting throughout Marin, row under the name of the Marin Rowing Association.\nNumerous Marin juniors have raced on Junior National Teams throughout the years, and some have gone on to represent the United States at the World Rowing Championships and the Olympics. Scott Munn, Fred Honebein, Tim Evans, Tim Ryan and Jerome Ryan, Mike Altman, Brian Ebke and Nito Simonsen are all Marin Rowing Association alumni.\nMarin Rowing Association Olympians\nThe club is currently managed by Sandy Armstrong, who was honored with the USRowing Ernestine Bayer Award at the 2013 USRowing Annual Convention.\nJunior Team.\nThe Marin Rowing Association offers a competitive high school rowing program for boys and girls from schools including Redwood High School, Tamalpais High School, Archie Williams High School, Marin Catholic High School, Marin Academy, San Francisco University High School, San Domenico High School, The Branson School, Convent of the Sacred Heart High School, and more.\nThe Marin juniors are divided into four teams: Under 19 Girls, Under 19 Boys, Under 15/16/17 Girls, and Under 15/16/17 Boys.\nHead of the Charles.\n2010\nAt the 46th Head of the Charles Regatta in 2010, the Marin boys eight made history by racing from the 69th starting position to win their event, posting a course record (14:50.246) in the process.

        "text": "Antonio Christopher Hunt (born November 24, 1985) is a former American football running back. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played two National Football League (NFL) seasons and one season in Europe Austrian Football League (AFL). Hunt played college football at Penn State.\nEarly years.\nA standout player at T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, Hunt rushed for more than 2,000 total yards and also played linebacker, defensive end, and even punted. He was named the Alexandria Sportsman Club Player-of-the-Year in 2002-03. He was also a stalwart on the track and field team, finishing eighth in Virginia in the discus as a junior.\nHunt originally made a verbal commitment to play football at University of Southern California, but instead signed a letter-of-intent with Penn State upon learning of Reggie Bush's commitment to the Trojans.\nCollege career.\nHunt finished his Penn State career 2nd all-time in career rushing yards with 3,320 yards and first all-time with 654 carries (5.08 avg.). A Doak Walker Award candidate in 2006, Hunt became only the fifth Nittany Lion to rush for back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons and the fifth to rush for more than 3,000 career yards. He was named Big Ten Conference Offensive Player of the Week after a career-best 167-yard rushing game versus Temple. \nHunt led Penn State in rushing during the 2005 and 2004 seasons, amassing 1,047 and 777 yards respectively, earning the nickname Tony \"Big Game\" Hunt.\nAt the outset of his college career, Hunt was overshadowed by fellow running back Austin Scott, who was considered the more promising recruit, having broken many Pennsylvania high school football records. Despite this, Hunt won the starting running back job through his work ethic, and by virtue of being a better pass blocker than Scott. \nHunt was also named the MVP of the 2007 Senior Bowl on January 27, 2007, after leading all running backs in total yards.\nHunt was also named the 2007 Outback Bowl MVP.\nProfessional career.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nHunt was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles, 90th overall, in the 3rd round of the 2007 NFL draft. Critics and fans alike thought the move would finally give Brian Westbrook the short-yardage back he always wanted. In his rookie season, however, Hunt saw limited playing time behind Correll Buckhalter managing just 16 carries and one touchdown. After the Eagles acquired Lorenzo Booker from Miami, he was pushed to fourth on the depth chart ahead of only Ryan Moats. The Eagles had traditionally only kept three. On August 18, 2008, the Eagles official website confirmed Hunt would get reps at fullback after Jed Collins, Jason Davis and Luke Lawton failed to secure the job, and Hunt's impressive preseason game against the Carolina Panthers which he broke a 51-yard run. He was unofficially named the Eagles' starter after the other three full backs were released.\nHunt was released from the Eagles on October 14, 2008.\nRaiffeisen Vikings Vienna.\nIn March 2011, Hunt was signed by the Raiffeisen Vikings Vienna, an American football team in Austria. He rushed for 413 yards on 88 carries and seven TD's in the 2011 Austrian Football League season."

Police launched an investigation in 2005, after Wagoner had left the gym. He pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault and was sentenced in 2006 to 15 years in prison.\nAfter Wagoner pled guilty, Crabb and her family sued WOGA's owners, alleging that the gym had failed to properly screen and supervise the coach. The suit did not seek a specific amount of money from the academy owners and did not accuse them of abuse. Bill Boyd, the gym's attorney, said all instructors receive a criminal background check and that the gym was not aware of any accusations until after Wagoner had left. In 2008, WOGA and Crabb settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.\nAlleged abuse of gymnasts.\nIn 2022, the U.S. Center for SafeSport launched an investigation into allegations of abuse of gymnasts by WOGA founder Liukin. \"Multiple gymnasts allege Liukin routinely berated, belittled and screamed at them, that he forced them to compete and train on broken bones or when they were ill, and in some cases they were fat-shamed daily,\" wrote the \"Orange County Register\", citing a Southern California News Group investigation published in March 2022. Liukin remained under investigation as of January 2023."

        "title": "American football in the Netherlands",
        "text": "American football in the Netherlands has been on the map both nationally and internationally since the 1980s. However, it took almost 40 years before the first American Football game played in the Netherlands was followed up. In 1946 two American University teams played an exhibition game in the Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam). Not until 1980 did the following step appear, when René Koningferander issued a request on the TV sports programme 'Sprekershoek' for people who were interested in the sport.\nKoningferander had been introduced to the sport by his gymnastics teacher Guus Annokkee who would go on to be the founder and inaugural chairman of the NAFF (Nederlandse American Football Federatie). Koningferander's TV plea instigated the founding of the Netherlands' first domestic club: the Amsterdam Rams.\nHistory.\n1981–1984: Growth of interest.\nThe first game played by an American football team from the Netherlands was on Easter Sunday in 1981 when the Amsterdam Rams faced the Herne Tigers from Germany. A lack of any Dutch opponents forced the Rams to compete in the German Oberliga in the 1983 and 1984 season. This successful German adventure led the Rams to a 1984 victory in the Oberliga West Division.\nMeanwhile, initiatives were springing up all over the Netherlands via exhibition games and the broadcasting of college football by the fledgling SkyChannel. From these flames a number of Dutch clubs emerged including The Hague Raiders, Delft Dragons, Rotterdam Trojans, Zwolle Bulldogs, Alphen Eagles and Utrecht Vikings. Toward the end of 1984 a number of players from the Amsterdam Rams broke off to form a second team from the nation's capital city: the Amsterdam Crusaders.\nThe Rams returned to the Netherlands and, along with the new teams, formed the Nederlandse American Football Federatie (NAFF).\n1985–1989: Dutch competition.\nThe first Dutch American Football season took place in 1985. Eight teams in a single division would compete against each other for a place in the Dutch championship game initially called the \"Super Bowl\". The first championship game saw the Amsterdam Rams face their former teammates the Amsterdam Crusaders. The Rams won the only Super Bowl - from 1986 the championship game was renamed the Tulip Bowl.\nMany factors combined to produce explosive growth in this new sport which had been imported from the United States. The number of teams grew from 8 in 1985 to around 40 by the end of the 1980s. In addition, the teams from larger cities were able to professionalise further by obtaining large sponsors, attracted by the freshness of the sport and the considerable media attention both in the TV and press, which enabled them to hire American players and coaches.\nIn 1986 the Netherlands organised Eurobowl I - the final of the European championship for national champions. The Amsterdam Rams achieved a respectable 3rd place in the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, with the Finnish Taft Vantaa claiming 1st place.\n1987 saw the NAFF run a full Dutch competition with no less than 3 divisions. This season also saw the debut of Dutch officiating crews, supported by officials from the US airbase in Soesterberg.\nEarly 1990s: Dutch Dynasty?\nThe early 1990s saw the growth of American Football in the Netherlands settle down. The obvious next step was to look to the future. Youth teams and a youth competition were formed, and flag teams for the youngest participants. The top division of senior competition saw an enormous increase of quality, aided by the import of US players and coaches. By this time the Dutch competition was considered one of the strongest in the whole of Europe. In 1993, two Dutch teams made it to the semi-finals of the Eurobowl: The Amsterdam Crusaders and The Hague Raiders. The Amsterdam Crusaders (who had dominated the NAFF competition between 1987 and 1991) showed their class at European level by reaching 5 Eurobowl finals and winning the European championship in 1991 and 1992, sparking talk of a \"Dutch dynasty\". The Dutch National team, the Dutch Lions, won the bronze medal in the European Championships in Helsinki, Finland, in 1991. Head coach at the time was coach John Ralston.\nLate 1990s: Challenging Times.\nThe mid-nineties saw the growth of the sport stagnate in the Netherlands, bringing about the demise of several clubs. The novelty of the sport wore off and it was evident in the diminishing interest of sponsors. Television exposure was no longer to be taken for granted and the growth of the youth competition was suffering. Conversely the sport was undergoing a renaissance in the rest of Europe, with media interest and crowds growing. This situation forced the decision by the Amsterdam Crusaders to pull out of the Dutch competition and instead compete in the ill-fated Football League of Europe in 1994 and 1995\nWhile the sport was struggling in the Netherlands, bigger thing were afoot for American Football on a global scale. 1991 saw the birth of the World League of American Football (WLAF). This precursor to NFL Europa was a professional competition founded and funded by the US league: the NFL. The intentions of the WLAF were two-fold: to increase the popularity of the sport in Europe and to act as a feeder league to the NFL, testing out young players who were on the brink of breaking into the NFL. These developments had a large influence on Dutch American Football.\nBy the end of the 1990s American Football as a sport in the Netherlands was in crisis. Only a third of teams had survived, no sponsors were involved in the sport, and the level had suffered as a result. At the same time, the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europa were pulling in crowds of 12,000 for home games - many of them spectators who ten years earlier would have been supporting the teams in the Dutch competitions."

He batted and threw left-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nBaumann signed with the Red Sox in 1952 out of high school in his native St. Louis, receiving a $90,000 bonus from owner Tom Yawkey, who nicknamed him \"Beau\". He won 10 of 11 decisions for the Triple-A Louisville Colonels in 1953, his second season in professional baseball, before being drafted into United States Army service during the Korean War.\nWhen he mustered out of the Army in mid-1955, he joined the MLB Red Sox in late July. In his debut, he earned a victory with 5 innings of scoreless relief, as Boston defeated the Detroit Tigers, 3–2. But an arm injury incurred during his military service hampered his Red Sox tenure. He needed return trips to the minor leagues from 1956 to 1958 before making the Red Sox roster for the full campaign. Then, that November, he was traded to the White Sox for first baseman Ron Jackson.\nIn , as a member of the defending American League champions, he had a 13–6 mark for the White Sox, and led AL pitchers with a 2.67 ERA. In 47 games pitched, including 20 starts, he compiled seven complete games and two shutouts. He added four saves as a relief pitcher. But he followed in with a disappointing 10–13 record, led the AL in earned runs allowed, and his ERA ballooned by almost three full runs, to 5.61. His effectiveness largely returned in , but thereafter he made only one more start over his final two years with the ChiSox and in he again struggled on the mound. His ERA climbed to 6.19, and Baumann was traded to the cross-town Cubs during the off-season. He made four appearances out of the Cub bullpen in 1965, posted an ERA over 7.00, and was sent to Triple-A during the May roster cutdown from 28 to 25 men. His active career concluded after that season.\nIn his 11-season MLB career, Baumann posted a 45–38 record with a 4.11 ERA and 14 saves in 244 games pitched. Of his 78 starting assignments, 19 were complete gates and four were shutouts. In 797 innings pitched, he allowed 856 hits and 300 base on balls, with 384 strikeouts.\nBaumann died on December 13, 2020, in St. Louis, Missouri."

In partnership with the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library located on the campus of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas, the Hall of Fame inducts former collegiate players and coaches who have met selection criteria of distinction. On January 23, 2024, the College Baseball Foundation announced it would open a physical hall of fame in Overland Park, Kansas, in the Museum at Prairiefire.\nHistory.\nThe College Baseball Foundation was formed in 2004 as a non-profit organization, with the dual aims of continuing the Brooks Wallace Award and creating a national college baseball hall of fame. The inaugural Wallace Award was bestowed in 2004, but the inaugural Hall of Fame induction class was not chosen until 2006. As of 2006, organizers hoped to have a permanent building constructed by 2008. As of January 2013, the Foundation had raised approximately $7 million of the $13 million goal, after receiving a $5 million grant from the Moody Foundation. A ceremonial groundbreaking was held in June 2015 in Lubbock. In April 2017, the Foundation announced that it would no longer pursue constructing a museum in Lubbock.\nInductees.\nThe 2006 inaugural class for the National College Baseball Hall of Fame consisted of five former coaches and five former players. Annually thereafter, through 2016, additional players and coaches were enshrined. In May 2017, organizers cancelled that year's annual “Night of Champions” induction ceremony.\nInduction.\nCriteria.\nSelection criteria and categorization has changed over time.\nThe original criteria, established in 2006, allow for recognition of:\nThe top ten voter-getters were selected for induction to the Hall of Fame. Veteran and Historical Committees could nominate individuals from the pre-1947 era, however there was no differentiation in how approved nominees were recognized.\nIn 2009, a small school category was added, \"featuring players and coaches from NAIA, NCAA Divisions II and III, and two-year colleges.\"\nIn 2011, a Legends and Pioneers Committee was created, \"...designed to provide recognition to black pioneers in college baseball and to honor outstanding players and coaches whose careers at Historically Black Colleges and Universities began prior to 1975.\" Also, nominees would now be required to reach a threshold of votes, rather than automatically inducting the top ten vote-getters.\nIn 2012, voting was revised with five ballot categories: Vintage Era (pre-1964) players and coaches, small school players, small school coaches, 1964–2001 players, and NCAA Division I coaches.\nCeremony.\nThe induction ceremony for the inaugural class occurred on July 4, 2006. The “Night of Champions” was usually held the day after the Brooks Wallace Award winner was announced; the most recent induction ceremony was held in 2016."

        "text": "The World Professional Basketball Tournament was an annual invitational tournament held in Chicago from 1939 to 1948 and sponsored by the \"Chicago Herald American\". Many teams came from the National Basketball League, but it also included the best teams from other leagues and the best independent barnstorming teams such as the New York Rens and Harlem Globetrotters. Games were played at various sites including Chicago Coliseum, International Amphitheater and Chicago Stadium.\nThe NBL champion usually won this tournament, with three exceptions: the New York Rens won the first WPBT in 1939, while the Harlem Globetrotters—a strongly competitive squad in those days—won the following year. In 1943, the Washington Bears (with many New York Rens players on their roster) won the tournament. The NBL's Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons won the most titles (three, from 1944 to 1946), while the NBL's Oshkosh All-Stars made the most finals appearances with five, winning only once (in 1942).\nThe last tournament was held in 1948, with the Minneapolis Lakers defeating the New York Rens 75–71 in the tournament final. The following year, The Indianapolis News attempted to hold a similar tournament, inviting the Wilkes-Barre Barons from the American Basketball League, three teams each from the Basketball Association of America and the National Basketball League, and one team that would remain unidentified until shortly before the seeded draw. Although the National Basketball League agreed to attend, the tournament did not come to fruition after the BAA declined the invitation."

He had a 15-year playing career spent in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and overseas. He was most recently the director of basketball operations and performance enhancement at the University of Houston, his alma mater.\nCollege career.\nYoung, a native Houstonian, played basketball at Yates High School and the University of Houston. With the Houston Cougars, he was part of Phi Slama Jama and was twice named to the Southwest Conference First Team. He played in the 1983 NCAA Final, a loss to the North Carolina State Wolfpack, as well as the 1984 final, a loss to the Georgetown Hoyas.\nProfessional career.\nNBA and CBA.\nMichael Young was selected by the Boston Celtics with the 24th overall pick (1st round) of the 1984 NBA draft.\nHe played in three NBA seasons: 1984–85 with the Phoenix Suns, 1985–86 with the Philadelphia 76ers, and 1989–90 with the Los Angeles Clippers. He also played two seasons with the Continental Basketball Association's Detroit Spirit, where he was named the CBA's Player of the Year in 1986 after averaging 26 points per game.\nOverseas.\nYoung also played in the Philippines, Spain, Italy, France and Israel.

        "text": "The 2006 Breeders' Cup Classic (in full, the Breeders' Cup Classic Powered by Dodge, due to sponsorship) was the 23rd running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2006 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program. It was run on November 4, 2006, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky.\nInvasor, an Argentinian-bred four-year-old who had won three Grade I stakes in the U.S. in 2006, was the surprise winner, beating out the heavily favored Bernardini in the stretch. It was the first Classic win for Invasor's owner, trainer and jockey.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m) with a purse in 2006 of $5,000,000, increased from $4,000,000 in 2005. It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nThere were 13 entries in the race. The even money favorite was the three-year-old colt Bernardini, who had won six straight races including the Preakness, Travers and Jockey Club Gold Cup. Bernardini, owned by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin Stable, assumed the leadership of the three-year-old division after Barbaro's breakdown in the Preakness, and needed to win the Classic to wrap up Horse of the Year honors.\nLava Man was the second favorite. The five-year-old gelding had won seven straight races in California, including the Santa Anita Handicap, Hollywood Gold Cup, Pacific Classic and Goodwood Breeders' Cup Handicap. He too had a chance at Horse of the Year honors if he could win outside of his home state, something he had never done.\nInvasor was the third favorite at nearly 7–1, somewhat overlooked despite having lost only one race in his career. He was bred in Argentina and won the Uruguayan Triple Crown, which caught the eye of Sheikh Hamden, Sheikh Mohammed's brother. Sheikh Hamden bought Invasor for Shadwell Stables and transferred him to trainer Kiaran McLaughlin. Invasor lost his first and only race when moved to Dubai, then shipped to the United States where he won the Pimlico Special, Suburban and Whitney. McLaughlin intended to race the colt in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, but missed it due to illness, meaning Invasor had not raced in nearly three months leading up to the Classic. Invasor had to be nominated to the Breeders' Cup as a horse of racing age at a cost of $250,000 (normally horses are nominated as foals at a much lower cost).\nGeorge Washington, considered Europe's best miler, was entered in the Classic, despite never having run on the dirt. Trainer Aidan O'Brien said, \"We know he would have been short-priced favorite for the Mile, but winning the Classic would open the whole world to him.\" David Junior was another European-based horse entered in the Classic. He had excellent form at a mile and a quarter but was coming into the Classic off a five-month layoff.\nOther entries included Brother Derek, winner of the Santa Anita Derby, Premium Tap, winner of the Woodward Stakes, Lawyer Ron, winner of the Super Derby, Perfect Drift, racing in the Classic for a record fifth time, Giacomo, the 2005 Kentucky Derby winner and Flower Alley, 2nd in the 2005 Classic.\nRace Description.\nBrother Derek took the early lead and set a brisk pace, followed by Lawyer Ron and Lava Man. Bernardini raced on the outside down the backstretch and started his move around the far turn. He assumed the lead at the head of the stretch, brushing Brother Derek as he went by. A later claim of foul by Brother Derek's jockey was disallowed. Although in front, Bernardini appeared to be struggling with the track and his jockey went to the whip.\nMeanwhile, Invasor raced on the outside of the pack during the early part of the race then made a strong move, drawing even with Bernardini with a sixteenth of a mile remaining. Bernardini attempted to fight back but Invasor drew away to win by a length in the time of 2:02.18.\nAlthough Sheikh Hamdan watched the race from Dubai, Invasor's former owner Pablo Hernandez was present at Kentucky to celebrate in the winner's circle. \"This is unbelievable,\" he said. \"This is the greatest experience of my life, and always will be. Invasor is still in the hearts of everyone in Uruguay. We are a small, modest country, and we need an idol. We have no idol in football and no idol in politics. Invasor is the idol of Uruguay. He is the 'Horse of the Rio de la Plata'.\"\nThe win made Invasor's jockey, Fernando Jara, the youngest to ever win a Breeders' Cup race. It was the first Breeders' Cup win for McLaughlin as well.\n\"I'm not disappointed at all. You can't win all the races,\" said Javier Castellano, the jockey of Bernardini. \"I had to ask him for the first time today. He passed the other horses easily. He gave me everything. He's a fighter and didn't want to get beat.\"\nThe main track at Churchill Downs came in for some criticism. Invasor was one of the few horses that day to win on the dirt from the outside – four earlier races on the dirt had all been won by horses running on the rail, including several large upsets. The final half-mile of the Classic was run in over 51 seconds, a slow time perhaps also indicative of a track bias given that both Invasor and Bernardini were running away from the rail.\nResults.\nSource: Equibase\nTimes: – 0:23.13; – 0:46.60; – 1:11.11; mile – 1:36.59; final – 2:02.18.\nFractional Splits: (:23.13) (:23.47) (:24.51) (:25.48) (:25.59)\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

        "text": "Olympiacos Men's Volleyball (, ), commonly referred to as Olympiacos, Olympiacos Piraeus or with its full name as Olympiacos SFP, is the men's professional volleyball department of the major Greek multi-sport club, Olympiacos SFP, based in Piraeus, Attica. The department was founded in 1926 and their home ground is the in Agios Ioannis Rentis, Piraeus.\nOlympiacos is the most successful club in Greek volleyball history, having won 31 Greek Volley League titles, 17 Cups, 6 League Cups, all national records, and 2 Super Cups. They are the only volleyball club in Greece to have won a European title, having actually won 3 European titles, 2 CEV Cups in 1996 and 2005 and 1 CEV Challenge Cup in 2023. Olympiacos is a traditional powerhouse in European volleyball, having played in 8 European finals in all three main CEV competitions: 2 times runners-up in the CEV Champions League in 1992 and 2002 (with 7 CEV Champions League final four participations), 2 times winners (1996, 2005) and 2 times runners-up (1997, 1998) in the CEV Cup, one-time winners (2023) and one time runners-up (2018) in the CEV Challenge Cup.\nDomestically, Olympiacos holds the record for the most consecutive championships won, with eight in a row (1987–1994), and for winning seven championships undefeated (1968, 1974, 1979, 1981, 1988, 1991, 2018). Internationally, their most successful period was between 1992 and 2005, when they came to be included amongst the top volleyball powers in Europe. During this period, apart from their two European trophies, they progressed to eleven final fours in total, seven of them consecutive between 1992 and 1998 (the first four in the CEV Champions League and the next three in the CEV Cup Winners' Cup); they also won a fourth place in the and a third in the FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship. Olympiacos came to European prominence again by playing in the 2017–18 CEV Challenge Cup final; at the same time, the women's department won their respective 2017–18 CEV Women's Challenge Cup. In this way, Olympiacos became the first volleyball club that had men and women playing simultaneously in European finals, and one of the very few to have won European trophies in both departments. In 2023, they won the CEV Challenge Cup, beating rivals Panathinaikos in the semi-finals and Maccabi Tel Aviv in the final.\nGiven the fact that Olympiacos is the most popular sports club in Greece, the men's volleyball department also receives great home support. Apart from some top Greek players such as Marios Giourdas, Giorgos Ntrakovits, Sakis Moustakidis, Vasilis Kournetas, Antonis Tsakiropoulos, Kostas Christofidelis, Mitar Tzourits, Olympiacos has also attracted over the years some foreign world-class players including Ivan Miljković, Lorenzo Bernardi, Jeff Stork, Marcos Milinkovic, , Raimonds Vilde, Vasa Mijić, Tom Hoff, Goran Vujević, Henk-Jan Held, Osvaldo Hernández, Fabian Drzyzga and Dragan Travica.\nSupporters.\nOlympiacos fans are renowned for their passionate and fervent support to the team, with the atmosphere at home matches regarded as extremely intense and intimidating to such an extent that is rarely seen in volleyball matches. In the decade of the 1900s and the early 2000s, Olympiacos was among the top powers in European volleyball (7 consecutive European Final Four participations, four in the CEV Champions League –1992, 1993, 1994, 1995– and three in the CEV Cup Winners' Cup –1996, 1997, 1998–, winners of the CEV Cup Winners' Cup, twice Runners-up of the CEV Champions League in and 2002, twice Runners-up of the CEV Cup Winners' Cup in and , third place in the world in the FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship in 1992 and fourth place in the ) and one of the best supported volleyball teams in Europe.\nIn the in Piraeus, an estimated 20,000 Olympiacos fans crowded the Peace and Friendship Stadium for the semi-final against CSKA Moscow and 20,000 more for the final against il Messaggero Ravenna. Volleyball legend Karch Kiraly, Hall of Famer and three times Olympic gold medalist, a key member of il Messaggero Ravenna at the time, talked about the 1992 CEV Champions League Final in a 2018 interview: \"That particular CEV Champions League Final Four in Piraeus was really a very special experience. Even now as we speak, the first thing that comes to my mind was the unbelievable atmposhere that we all lived in that volleyball game in Athens 26 years ago. In that day I cherished the Greek supporters and the passion of Olympiacos fans for volleyball. It was something unique.\"\nIn the 1996 which was held again in Piraeus and the Peace and Friendship Stadium, an estimated 18,000 to 20,000 Olympiacos fans filed into SEF and created the most intense atmosphere, pushing the team to their first ever European title against the German side , after a hard-fought 3–2 win. After the victory, hundreds of ecstatic Olympiacos fans stormed the court and celebrated the title with the players.\nOlympiacos hosted the in 2005 and Olympiacos supporters relived some of the 1990s moments. 15,000 fans packed the Peace and Friendship Stadium and provided once again an electric atmosphere, helping Olympiacos to win their second European title, after a 3–0 win against the Dutch side in the final.\nIn 2018 Peace and Friendship Stadium lived once again some of its timeless glory, as an estimated 12,000 Olympiacos fans created an extraordinary atmosphere in the final of the 2017–18 CEV Challenge Cup against Bunge Ravenna. Ravenna's Austrian star talked about the atmosphere in the post-game interview: \"\"The atmosphere, the fans were really great. It was a \"red hell\", when I entered the court I had goose bumps. I have never played in front of such a big crowd.\"\"\nOn 15 March 2023, 13,000 Olympiacos fans created an amazing atmosphere in a fully packed Peace and Frienship Stadium, as they helped Olympiacos win the 2022–23 CEV Challenge Cup, their third European title, after beating Maccabi Tel Aviv 3–0 in the second leg of the finals.\nKit manufacturer.\nThe table below shows the history of kit providers for the Olympiacos team."

        "title": "Baseball stirrups",
        "text": "Baseball stirrups, also called stirrup socks or simply stirrups, are socks that are part of a traditional baseball uniform, giving the uniform a distinctive look. Stirrup socks are usually one of a team's traditional colors, and are worn over long socks that are usually white in color. The stirrup sock lacks toe and heel sections, instead having a loop (a stirrup) which fits within the arch of the foot. Over the years, the stirrup loop tended to get longer, exposing more of the white undersock, thus creating a look unique to baseball. Most contemporary players in Major League Baseball (MLB) do not wear stirrup socks, as uniform pants that extend all the way down to the ankle have become increasingly popular since the mid-1990s.\nHistory.\nIn the early days of the sport, baseball players wore their pant legs low. High socks, and with it, knickerbockers (\"knickers\"), which were commonly worn by boys in the late 19th century and into the 20th century, were introduced as part of the baseball uniform by the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings. They wore red stockings that were displayed prominently with the high pants, true to their name, but it was not until the early 20th century that the stirrup stocking was introduced. In 1905, Nap Lajoie suffered an infected spike wound, attributed to the dye in his socks (fabric color dyes were thought not to be colorfast in those days), that nearly resulted in his leg being amputated. Lajoie's solution to this was to wear white sanitary socks (\"sanitaries\"), but this posed another problem. The colored sock was difficult to put on with the extra white socks, so another solution came of this: A footless sock with a small arched opening at the bottom, to be called \"stirrup\" socks, due to their resemblance to stirrup irons used in equestrian events. The less expensive white sock could be changed more frequently. These stirrups were initially meant to mimic the solid-color socks.\nStirrup socks are worn on top of sanitary socks and serve to display team colors, stripes or team logos. For example, for several years the Minnesota Twins wore navy blue stirrups with \"TC\" on the side (for \"Twin Cities\") and the Houston Astros wore either navy blue or orange stirrup socks with a star in the opposite color on the side. The stirrup sock colors were also the basis of team names, including the Cincinnati Red Stockings, Boston Red Sox, and Chicago White Sox.\nAs the 20th century progressed, players began to wearing their stirrup loops higher and higher. By the 1970s, many players were pulling the stirrup loop so high that only the white sanitary sock and the stirrup loop itself showed, with the rest of the stirrup sock being hidden by their pants. In the 1980s, stirrups finally reached their highest point with some players showing nothing but the vertical lines of their stirrups, sold as \"ribbon stirrups\". Around the same time, a \"two-in-one\" sock was created; it mimics the look of a stirrup sock over a white sock, simply being a high white sock with a woven-on colored stripe or stirrup down each side. The minor-league Springfield Cardinals wear a two-in-one version of the traditional St. Louis Cardinals' stirrup sock and sanitary sock combination, which looks very much like the real thing. Another option used by players has been to forego stirrup socks and wear solid-color knee-high socks with knickers. \nStirrup socks were worn by most baseball players until the 1990s, when Major League Baseball (MLB) players began wearing their pants down to the ankles, setting a trend soon picked up by players at all levels, thus returning baseball to its look in the sport's formative years. Also, increasingly lax regulation of uniform codes eventually contributed to many players ignoring the traditional look. As stirrup socks were a recognizable feature of baseball uniforms for more than a century, traditionalists lament the contemporary \"low pants\" look in baseball uniforms. Today, players wear either their pant legs low, or if wearing high pants, stirrups or solid color stockings.\nSome players, such as Chris Archer (MLB debut 2012), Francisco Lindor (MLB debut 2015), and Josh Outman (MLB debut 2008) returned to wearing real stirrup socks over sanitary socks. A trend back to knickers and high socks is also particularly evident among youth and high-school teams.\nRules.\nWhile the Official Baseball Rules are silent on stirrups, some players on a team wearing them while others do not seems to be in violation of Rule 1.11(a)(1), which states \"all players on a team shall wear uniforms identical in color, trim and style,\" as well as Rule 1.11(a)(3), which states \"no player whose uniform does not conform to that of his teammates shall be permitted to participate in a game.\" For many years, teams had enforced rules so that uniforms were worn \"uniformly\", including the team's socks. For example, Leo Durocher, manager of the Chicago Cubs in the late 1960s, had a measuring stick in the clubhouse. Players were required to match the length of their stirrup loops to the stick at about , exposing only a small part of the white sanitary sock.\nOther sports.\nOther sports also use, or have used, stirrup socks, but traditionally wore a white sweat sock over, instead of under, the colored stirrup game sock (e.g. basketball, football, hockey). For many years, American football officials commonly wore black baseball-style stirrups as part of their uniform (in some leagues by the 1980s, this would be replaced by one-piece stockings with the black/white stripes on the top half and a white bottom half) although this was done away with by the early 2010s as black full-length slacks replaced the traditional white knickers. There are still some sock companies manufacturing stirrup socks for baseball and other sports, including Twin City Knitting Company in Conover, North Carolina."

Leesville was the 4A state runner-up that year and Cecil was selected as Louisiana's very first \"Mr. Football\".\nCollin's struggles began during his senior season at Leesville when the NCAA Clearinghouse declared that he would be required to retake his ACT Test. Cecil had taken the test during his Junior year and had not scored well enough to qualify for Division I schools. At the beginning of his Senior season he retook the exam and improved five points giving him an acceptable score.

        "text": "Robert Richard Sheehan (born January 11, 1949) is an American former professional ice hockey player, who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) and World Hockey Association (WHA) between 1969 and 1982 as a center.\nCareer.\nAs a youth, Sheehan played in the inaugural 1960 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the junior Boston Bruins. A small player by hockey standards, Sheehan made up for his physical deficits by leading the NSJHL minor league with 64 goals his rookie year. He was drafted in the third round, 32nd overall by the Montreal Canadiens and went on to play parts of three seasons in the NHL. He was a reserve on the Canadiens Stanley Cup-champion team in 1971 and then joined the lowly California Golden Seals where he quickly became a regular and one of the top forwards for his new club. \nIn 1972, Sheehan joined the New York Raiders of the World Hockey Association, who had obtained his WHA rights from the New England Whalers. In 1975–76, he returned to the NHL with the Chicago Black Hawks and would transfer between the NHL and American Hockey League (AHL) - plus another stop in the WHA - several times until his retirement in 1983.\nAfter spending the entire 1978-79 regular season with the New Haven Nighthawks of the AHL, Sheehan was called up by the New York Rangers to center Pat Hickey and Ron Duguay in the playoffs, which ultimately led to the 1979 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Montreal Canadiens in five games. In 15 playoff games, Sheehan had four goals and three assists, and incurred eight penalty minutes.\nIn a career-total 310 NHL games, Sheehan recorded 48 goals and 63 assists for 111 points.\nInternational play.\nSheehan represented the United States at the 1981 Ice Hockey World Championship tournament. He scored one goal and one assist in eight games."

        "title": "U.S. Open (bowling)",
        "text": "The U.S. Open is one of the five major tournaments in the Professional Bowlers Association. Despite its status as a PBA Tour major, the tournament is open to qualifying amateurs as well as PBA members. The U.S. Open is considered one of the most difficult tournaments to bowl in today, due to its long format (56 games from opening qualifying through the match play rounds; 64 games if a player from the pre-tournament qualifier makes it through) and demanding oil pattern, which differs from most oil patterns the PBA employs.\nTournament history.\nWith the exception of 1997 and 2014, the U.S. Open has been held in some form every year since . Prior to 1971, this event was known as the BPAA All-Star. Andy Varipapa is notable for winning back-to-back BPAA All-Star titles in 1947 and 1948, the second coming at age 57, which makes him this tournament's oldest winner. BPAA All-Star winners in the PBA era (1959–1970) were initially not credited with PBA titles for their victories. A rule change in 2008, however, retroactively awarded titles to the winners if they were PBA members at the time of their victories. Because the 1959 BPAA All-Star occurred before the PBA's debut, Harry Smith (1960) is considered the first PBA titlist in a BPAA All-Star event.\nThe first modern-day U.S. Open tournament in the PBA took place in 1971 and was won by Mike Limongello. With five wins, Pete Weber holds the most U.S. Open trophies of all time, one more than his father, Dick Weber, and Don Carter. Pete Weber is also the only player to win a U.S. Open title in four different decades (1988, 1991, 2004, 2007 and 2012). The last player to successfully defend a U.S. Open title was Dave Husted, who won the event in 1995 and 1996.\nThe , sponsored by Seagram Wine Coolers, offered a then-record total purse of $500,000, and was the first PBA tournament to award a $100,000 first prize (won by Del Ballard Jr.).\nUnable to find viable sponsorship, the U.S. Open was canceled for 2014, amid speculation that the tournament may not return at all. However, the USBC and BPAA later reached a three-year agreement that brought the tournament back for 2015, 2016 and 2017. The USBC and BPAA secured Bowlmor AMF, at the time the largest operator of bowling centers in the world, as the title sponsor for 2015. The 2015 tournament took place November 2–8 in Garland, Texas.\nBeginning in 2017 with the U.S. Open held at Flamingo Bowl in Liverpool, New York, the tournament instituted a partial invitational field for the first time. Among those invited are top money leaders among PBA members, top performers from a variety of USBC events, members of Team USA and Junior Team USA, winners of the past ten U.S. Opens, the last three winners from each of the PBA's other major championships, and winners of the current year PBA Regional Tour U.S. Open qualifier tournaments. The \"open\" portion of the tournament is actually a pre-tournament qualifier (PTQ) with a maximum of 80 entries. Top finishers from the eight-game PTQ then join all those who accepted invitations to round out the starting field of 144 players. The 2018 event had 116 invitational entries and only 28 open spots available via the PTQ. In 2019, only 91 invitees entered the tournament, so 53 open spots were filled from the PTQ.\nFormat.\nStarting in 2020, the starting field has been limited to only 108 players. After the starting field is determined, players bowl 24 qualifying games in three 8-game blocks on three different lane conditions. The top 36 in pinfall advance to the cashers round for 8 more games. The top 24 players after the cashers round then bowl 24 round-robin, head-to-head match play games, all on the same 41-foot pattern. In the match play round, players are awarded actual pinfall plus 30 bonus pins for every match won (15 bonus pins each in the case of a tie). The top five after the match play round advance to the televised championship finals, which is on the same oil pattern as match play.\nCurrent champion.\n2024 Event.\nThe 2024 U.S. Open was held at Woodland Bowl in Indianapolis, Indiana on January 28 to February 4, with a pre-tournament qualifier on January 27. The tournament had a field of 108 players and a prize fund of $297,490, with a $100,000 top prize. Kyle Troup, the runner-up in the 2023 U.S. Open, won his eleventh PBA Tour title and second major. Qualifying as the #3 seed, Troup defeated three previous U.S. Open champions on his way to the title. In his first match, he knocked off #4 seed and 2023 winner E. J. Tackett, then defeated Jason Belmonte in the semifinal match. Against top seed Anthony Simonsen, Troup rolled to a 223–181 victory, donning his first-ever green jacket.\nU.S. Open oil pattern.\nThe U.S. Open featured what PBA.com describes as \"the toughest lane oil design in all of bowling.\" The pattern is considered \"flat,\" meaning equal amounts of oil are applied to every lane board. (A typical lane condition allows more oil in the middle section of lane boards, and lesser amounts on the outer boards.)\nMany claim the oil pattern was responsible for the lack of left-handed winners in this tournament, because there isn't enough ball traffic on the left side to create a \"track area.\" When Mike Scroggins won the 2009 event in North Brunswick, New Jersey, he became the first left-hander in 20 years (Mike Aulby, 1989) to earn a U.S. Open title. Aulby's win was on an oil pattern where oil was applied more heavily on the outer boards (that is, those closest to the gutters), to the point where the outer parts of the lanes were effectively unplayable. In all, left-handers accounted for six victories (McGrath [1973], Moser [1976], Petraglia [1977], Cook [1986], Aulby [1989], and Scroggins [2009]) and nine runner-up finishes (Anthony [1973, 1979, 1980], Davis [1974], Devers [1992], Bohn [1994], Couch [1999], Allen [2005], Scroggins [2010]) at the U.S. Open since 1971. It was also the only major title that left-hander and 43-time titlist Earl Anthony never won in his career, though he did finish runner-up three times. In recent years, lefties Ryan Ciminelli (2015) and Rhino Page (2017) have won U.S. Opens."

        "title": "Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey is an (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents the University of Maine. The Black Bears are a member of Hockey East. Home games are played at Harold Alfond Sports Arena commonly known as Alfond Arena in Orono, Maine.\nThe Black Bears have appeared in 11 Frozen Fours, have a 28–18 record in NCAA Tournament games, and have won two national championships—in 1993 and 1999.\nProgram history.\nBirth of Maine ice hockey (1977–84).\nThe University of Maine, then known as the University of Maine at Orono, officially developed an NCAA-sanctioned men's ice hockey program in 1977. The program and arena construction happened at the same time.\nThis was not, however, the first attempt at birthing a permanent hockey program in Orono. Maine played in 17 games of college hockey in 1922 and 1923. They played other Maine colleges such as Bowdoin, Colby, and Bates. This program did not stick, and it would be over 5 decades before organized hockey would become a staple at the state's flagship university.\nUpon its foundation in 1977, the program was coached by Jack Semler (University of Vermont '68). Maine enjoyed modest success under Semler boasting winning records in 3 of their first 4 regular seasons. The Black Bears competed in The Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) during their first 7 years of existence, all of which were under Semler. The ECAC was recognized as Division-II hockey until 1979 at which point the conference, and thus Maine, became Division-I – the level of competition they have competed in ever since.\nShawn Walsh era (1984–2001).\nFollowing the 1983–84 season, head coach Jack Semler submitted their resignation.[1] With Maine set to join the newly formed Hockey East Association, Maine hired Shawn Walsh, a 29-year-old assistant at Colorado State University and ex-3rd string goalie at Bowling Green State University. Walsh was assistant coach for Ron Mason at Michigan State and Alma Mater. In only half a decade, the Spartans went from being sub-.500 performers to national contenders.\nThey inherited a struggling team, so win/loss improvement was not immediate; Maine posted a 23–57–2 record over Walsh's first two years with the program. However, Walsh was getting good recruits and convincing the school, state, and fans that UMaine could become a college hockey powerhouse. In 1986, Walsh and the program saw the first of many significant accomplishments. At 24–16–2, he posted his first winning season as a head coach. The team also made its first NCAA tournament appearance that season, coincidentally losing in the first round to Michigan State.\nAfter finishing as the conference runner up in '87 and '88, Maine brought home its first significant championship in the 1988–89 season. Walsh's Black Bears skated past Boston College in a 5–4 win for their first of 5 HEA Championships. Four of these would come under Walsh. Due to the success and popularity of the program, Alfond Arena expanded its capacity from 3,800 to more than 5,000 in 1992.\n1993 National Championship.\nMaine was a heavy favorite to win its first national championship during the '91–'92 season. Unfortunately, those hopes were dashed when they suffered a surprise first-round loss to Michigan State. The team lost many important players, including Hobey Baker Award winner Scott Pellerin, after the season. People expected the team to underperform entering '92–'93.\nHowever, college hockey would soon learn that the Black Bears had an exceptionally gifted freshman class on their hands in 1992. This included future NHL Star Paul Kariya, and highly touted identical twin forwards Peter and Chris Ferraro. With Jim Montgomery, \"Little\" Cal Ingraham, Chris Imes, Garth Snow and Mike Dunham, Maine had a chance to make history.\nKariya scored 100 points in one season at school, while Montgomery finished his successful college years with 301 points. They had a 42–1–2 season record, won the HEA regular season title, and won the HEA conference championship. They also won their first national championship.\nTheir destiny was almost blown during the Frozen Four semifinals against the University of Michigan when the referees disallowed an otherwise legitimate Maine goal. The backside of the net was raised when the puck slid in causing confusion as to if it really went in. As a result, the game was tied at the end of regulation when Maine felt they should have won. In overtime, Lee Saunders scored the game-winner and sent Maine to the title game against defending champ Lake Superior State University.\nMaine's near-perfect season found itself in jeopardy once again in the championship game. Despite an early and promising 2–0 lead, the Bears found themselves trailing the seasoned Lakers 4–2 after two periods. Working double shifts for period number three, two likely heroes emerged. Jim Montgomery scored a natural hat-trick in the third period, lifting Maine to a 5–4 win. Kariya assisted on all three goals.\nThere was a crackdown on many big college hockey programs during the 1990s for playing athletes who were deemed ineligible. Maine was one of these teams, and they suffered consequences including forfeited losses both retroactively and in future seasons. Some people questioned whether the 1993 title was real. But the NCAA let it go because the players were from past seasons and didn't play in Maine's championship.\n1999 National Championship.\nThe middle years of the 1990s were bittersweet for the Black Bears. They enjoyed some on-ice success and finished the national runner up in 1995, but due to sanctions and penalties for reasons previously mentioned, they were unable to compete in the NCAA tournament in 1996 and '97.\nThe 1998–1999 season crowned a much-less-likely champion than that of 1993. Maine did not win the regular season crown, nor did they even land in their own conference tournament final. They advanced to the NCAAs on an at-large bid due to a successful regular season, but were not most analysts' favorite to win the national title.\nFollowing wins over Ohio State and Clarkson University, Maine advanced to the 1999 Frozen Four in Anaheim, California, where they would meet some familiar foes. Not long after Maine and Boston College met in the Hockey East semifinals, they squared off again in the national semis, with Maine goalie Alfie Michaud besting Scott Clemmensen and lifting the Black Bears past the Eagles 2–1 in overtime.\nThough Maine's traditional nemesis for years was Boston University (not only through meaningful games, but because of a well-documented rivalry between Shawn Walsh and BU head coach Jack Parker), an even bigger feud was emerging between Maine and the neighboring New Hampshire Wildcats.\nLed by Hobey Baker Award winner Jason Krog and future NHL goaltender Ty Conklin, #1 ranked UNH was primed to win their program's first national championship. Goals by Ben Guite and Niko Dimitrakos (Maine), and more outstanding goaltending by eventual tournament MVP Alfie Michaud kept Maine competitive and the scoreboard read 2–2 at the end of regulation.\nShortly after the 10-minute mark in OT, a careless play by UNH in their defensive zone turned into Maine's opportunity as Cory Larose swiped a drifting puck off the nearside boards and made a cross-ice pass to Marcus Gustafsson. Conklin made the initial save but with no defensive help, Gustafsson collected his own rebound and scored the game winner to clinch Maine's second national championship.\nThe Death of Walsh.\nCoach William \"Shawn\" Walsh inherited a relatively new and obscure hockey program at The University of Maine in 1984 and he was convinced that it could be built up to greatness. His finger was clearly on the pulse of every aspect of the program, and he held a sincere understanding of what it would take to develop success.\nIt would take a diligent combination of recruiting the right players, a proper coaching staff to develop talent, the support of the university and the Athletic Department, and highly engaged fan bases both on and off campus to create a top college-hockey program.\nHe took personal ownership in each of these categories. During its grassroots, there are even great stories passed on of Walsh marching into the student dining commons, standing up and shouting on the tables, rallying students down to the games, and encouraging them to create a loud and hostile environment for Maine's opponents. The light blue \"Maine-iak\" shirts worn by the students at UMaine were one of his many ideas.\nMost supporters and enthusiasts of the program credit the foundation of greatness held by the Black Bear Men's Ice Hockey team almost exclusively to Shawn Walsh.\nIn June 2000 Walsh was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (cancer of the kidneys). Knowing that his time may be limited, he hand-selected the coach he wanted to take over the team were he unable to continue. Always known as a fiery coach, Walsh surprised some when he selected mild-mannered UMass Lowell River Hawks coach Tim Whitehead (Hamilton '85). Whitehead earned his graduate degree in education at the University of Maine approximately 10 years prior, and during this time he worked with Walsh as a graduate assistant coach.\nShawn Walsh died from cancer on September 24, 2001.\nA green clover with his name underneath is hung in his honor along with the three retired players' numbers in Alfond Arena. In 2006 the Shawn Walsh Hockey Center, a new extension of Alfond Arena with coaching and administrative offices, meeting areas, and new player facilities opened. This several-million-dollar project was funded through private donations—many coming from dozens of players Walsh coached through his 17 years with Maine.\nTim Whitehead era (2001–2013).\nTim Whitehead became the interim head coach following the death of Shawn Walsh at the start of the 2001–2002 season. He was later named the permanent head coach after a very successful first campaign in a year where he was eventually honored with the Spencer Penrose award which recognizes the NCAA coach of the year. Walsh won the Penrose award in 1995.\nThe team reached the championship game in 2002, the first season under Whitehead. Attempting to \"win it for Shawn,\" they had to play The University of Minnesota Golden Gophers in the Gophers' home state for the finals. They were one minute away from a win when Minnesota tied the game with their goalie pulled. In overtime, after a tripping penalty on Michael Schutte of Maine, the Gophers scored the winning goal on the power play.\nTwo years later, backed by the most statistically strong single-season goalie tandem in the NCAA record books (Jimmy Howard 1.19GAA .953 Save pct *both NCAA records; Frank Doyle 1.81GAA), future NHL player Dustin Penner, a slew of popular forwards including Todd Jackson, Colin Shields, Maine's own Greg Moore and Derek Damon, conference rookie of the year Michel Leveille, and tough-guy defenseman Prestin Ryan, Maine found itself back in the big game.\nThe Bears controlled the tempo and jumped on the board early against University of Denver on a Derek Damon goal, but the referees disallowed the goal explaining that part of the skate of Mike Hamilton crossed a line on the goalie crease as the goal went in. Though Howard only allowed one goal, Maine's offense could not find its rhythm after the disallowed goal and they lost 1–0.\nThat offseason, the NCAA reviewed the rule it followed to call off Maine's goal. They decided to adjust the rule to emulate the NHL's policy on this type of play, that is, only making a \"man-in-the-crease\" call if the player whose skate crosses the crease actually affects the outcome of the play or the goalie's ability to make the save.\nMaine Recession.\nIn the summer of 2008, assistant coach Guy Perron and Volunteer Assistant Coach Grant Standbrook both stepped aside from the program. Standbrook retired, while Perron was hired as an amateur scout for the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League. In 2006 and 2007 Maine would go to the Frozen Four but hit a regrouping session in 2008. 2008 was a dark year as Maine finished 9th in Hockey East and didn't even qualify for the playoffs, then in 2009 Maine entered the Hockey East Playoffs 8th and was eliminated in the first round by BU.\nIn 2010 Maine reversed their two-year drought and finished 4th in Hockey East, Maine would go all the way to the Hockey East Championship but would lose to BC. The next year a resurgent Merrimack team finished 4th and eliminated Maine from the Hockey East Tournament and once again dashed their hopes of getting back to the national tournament. Going into the 2012 Maine didn't look very likely to break the 4-year drought, especially with the early departure of junior standout Gustav Nyquist, but Spencer Abbott would step up and have an incredible campaign. Abbott would lead the nation in scoring, and lead Maine to 4th in Hockey East, Maine would go all the way to the Hockey East championship, but would once again be beat by future national champion Boston College.\nEven though Maine lost in the Hockey East championship they had a good enough record to qualify for the national tournament breaking a four-year drought. The terrific 2012 season ended in the first round of the national tournament with a loss to defending national champion University of Minnesota Duluth. Whitehead was fired on Tuesday April 9, 2013, after going 11–19–8.\nRed Gendron era (2013–2021).\nOn May 17, 2013, University of Maine Paul W. Ferguson and director of athletics Steve Abbott introduced Red Gendron as the fifth men's hockey head coach in the history of the University of Maine. Gendron's first major step towards rebuilding Maine hockey came on June 10, 2013 when he named former Maine Black Bear and NHL player Ben Guité as his first assistant coach. On June 25, 2013, Gendron announced, longtime NHL coach and scout Jay Leach as associate head coach. Like Gendron, Leach previously served as an assistant coach for UMaine hockey under Shawn Walsh.\nThe program has continued to struggle under Red Gendron; the Black Bears have posted just two winning seasons since 2012, and in 2014–15, they finished dead last in the Hockey East standings, with an abysmal 8-24-6 overall record, their worst season since 1982. In April 2017, Jay Leach announced his retirement from the program. Coach Guite replaced him as associate head coach. That July, the program hired former Maine goaltender Alfie Michaud as assistant coach. In the 2017–18 season, the team began to make progress, posting an 18-16-4 record, including a nine-game unbeaten streak. The team's overall record fell back slightly to 15-17-4 in the 2018–19 season, but their Hockey East conference record climbed to 11-9-4, good for sixth place out of eleven teams. The following season saw the most successful campaign of Gendron's tenure. The team was picked to finish 8th in Hockey East play, and the season opener resulted in a 7–0 loss at Providence, the worst season-opening loss in program history. However, despite the poor start, the team exceeded its meager expectations; backed by goaltender Jeremy Swayman, the Black Bears managed to finished the regular season with an 18-11-5 record (12-9-3 HEA), finishing 4th in the league and earning home ice in the Hockey East quarterfinals for the first time since 2012. However, on March 12, 2020, the NCAA hockey season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gendron was named Hockey East Coach of the Year; Swayman was named Hockey East Player of the Year and the Mike Richter Award as the nation's top goaltender, becoming the first Black Bear to earn the award.\nShortly after the end of Maine's abbreviated 2020–21 season, Gendron died following a medical episode while on a golf course.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nChampionships.\nNational Championships.\nRunners-up in 1995, 2002, 2004\nHockey East Tournament Championships.\nRunners-up in 1987, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2010, 2012\nRivalries.\nBorder War/ New Hampshire Wildcats.\nThe Border War refers to the rivalry between the UNH Wildcats and the Maine Black Bears. College Hockey News has ranked it as the seventh best Division I college hockey rivalry. The Rivalry is extremely intense because of the proximity of the states and the overall success of the two programs. The two programs have also met many times in meaningful post-season games. In 1999 Maine defeated UNH 3–2 in overtime to claim their second national championship, this essentially started the chant \"We have 2, How about you!\" chanted by Maine fans. Then again in 2002 Maine beat UNH in the national semifinals for a chance at the national championship. Maine and UNH has also met in the Hockey East playoffs many times, fueling the rivalry even more. In 2012 Maine once again defeated UNH in a large scale game at Fenway Park, winning 5–4 in overtime.\nBoston College Eagles.\nThe rivalry between Maine and BC is not one of as much publicity as that of Maine/UNH or BC/BU, but is still intense. Maine and BC have met in 7 Hockey East Championship games with Maine winning 2 of those championships, The teams have also met in 4 Hockey East semifinals, with Maine winning 1 semifinal against BC. This rivalry is another rivalry where the success of both teams has contributed to the intensity of the games between the two teams. Maine and BC have also met in 2 national semifinals, Maine won both meetings, but never in a national championship game. Maine and BC have 7 combined national championships.\nBoston University Terriers.\nThe rivalry between Maine and BU is one much like Maine/BC. They've only met in 2 Hockey East Championship, games each team winning one. In 1993 Maine lost only one game all year to BU, this loss came after taking a large lead and blowing it. Maine and BU also met in the 1995 National Championship game, BU won the game 6–2. Maine and BU have met 6 times in the Hockey East semifinals, Maine has won all 6 semifinals. The intensity of the games, combined with the mutual dislike of the fans results in very heated games every time they meet.\nFlorida College Classic.\nThe Florida College Classic is an annual single elimination tournament played in Estero, Florida at Germain Arena. The Tournament is co-hosted by Maine and Cornell each year, also 2 other teams will play to form a semifinal format. Since Shawn Walsh was so instrumental to the inception of the tournament the Most Outstanding Player receives the Shawn Walsh Memorial Trophy.

        "title": "American football plays",
        "text": "In American football, a play is a close-to-the-ground plan of action or strategy used to move the ball down the field. A play begins at either the snap from the center or at kickoff. Most commonly, plays occur at the snap during a down. These plays range from basic to very intricate. Football players keep a record of these plays in a playbook.\nOrder of a play.\nA play begins in one of two ways:\nOnce the play begins, it will continue until one of the following events happens:\nWhen the play ends, the ball is set for the next play. For the first three instances above, the ball is set at the point of its \"maximum forward progress\". That means that if a runner is driven back in the process of a tackle OR is ruled down by lack of forward progress, the ball is placed as close to his opponent's goal line as he had gotten before being driven back. If he runs backwards of his own volition, the ball is marked where he goes down. In the case of an incomplete pass, the ball is placed at the previous line of scrimmage.\nPlay then resumes as described above.\nFormation requirements.\nThe offensive team must have seven players on the line of scrimmage at the start of a play. Those players may be positioned at any place along the line of scrimmage (which extends all of the way across the playing field).\nThe defensive team may position as many as 11 players on the line of scrimmage. Usually, there are from 3 to 8 defensive players on the line of scrimmage.\nFormation Types.\nThere are several different types of formations, however, in modern football, formations can typically be classified into 4 categories:\nOffensive plays.\nRunning plays.\nIn a running play, the ball is advanced beyond the line of scrimmage by a player who receives it from behind the line of scrimmage. The player advancing the ball can be:\nor\nUp the middle.\nAlso called \"dive\", \"plunge\", \"buck\", \"gut\", \"slam\" or numerous other names. The most basic run play is a run up the middle. In this case, the ball is handed off from the quarterback to a running back. The back then aims for a predetermined hole between his offensive linemen. This hole can be either between center and guard or between guard and tackle. The offensive line will run block, pushing defenders away from the chosen hole. Often, the fullback will lead block through the hole first to clear a path for the half back or running back.\n W T G C G T E\n ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ W\nIso.\nAlso called a Halfback Lead, this is one of the most basic power runs in football. It is designed to isolate the fullback on a block with a linebacker, giving the halfback an easy 5 yard gain. Meanwhile, the other linebackers are blocked on combo blocks from the offensive line. Because it requires a fullback, it is usually run out of I-formations, however there are several variants of the play that can be run in other formations.\nOff tackle.\nThe 'bread-and-butter' of a run-oriented offense, this is typically the most common run play. Rather than aiming for a hole in the line, the running back aims for the spot just \"outside\" the tackle. This type of play allows for more improvisation by the running back once he is past the line, since there is often more open field in this area than in any run up the middle.\nToss.\nIn a toss play, the RB \"curves out\" toward the sideline on either side and the QB pitches (\"tosses\") the ball to the RB.\nSweep.\nIn a sweep play, the fullback begins by running towards the sideline before heading forward. This motion allows for some of the offensive linemen, often one or both guards, to \"pull\" from their normal positions and establish a \"lane\" for the running back to run through. A lead blocking fullback often leads him through the lane. This play, known as the Packers sweep, was the central play in Vince Lombardi's \"run-to-daylight\" offense that was so successful for the Green Bay Packers of the 1960s.\nTrap.\nIn a trap, a guard on the \"back\" side of the play (away from the direction the fullback or running\nback is heading) will pull and lead block for the running back (most of the time, the guard will blindside an unblocked down linemen, and kick him out of the play). Often, the fullback will take the place of the guard, and block the opening allowed by this.\n _\n _ _ _ | _ _\n W T G C G | T E\n |_______| W\nCounter.\nAlso called a \"misdirection\". In this play, the runner begins by taking a step or two \"away\" from his intended path, then doubling back and heading in the opposite direction. Often defenders are clueing on the first move of the running back. The defenders committed to the first step, but the play moves in the opposite direction.\nCounter plays are often (but not always) coupled with \"influence\" blocking, where the offensive line blocks the defense towards (rather than away from) the intended direction of the play. This gambit often causes the defenders to think the play is going in the opposite direction, and they react as such.\nDraw.\nAlso called a \"delay\". In a draw play, the offensive line drops into pass blocking positions, and the quarterback takes a drop as though he were going to pass. He then hands the ball off to his running back (or keeps it himself) and runs forward past the rushing defenders. The idea is that the defenders will be tricked in advancing on the quarterback as though it were a pass play, and this will vacate the area just beyond the line of scrimmage for the runner to take advantage of.\nBootleg.\nThe quarterback fakes a handoff to the running back and continues running with the ball opposite from the direction the running back was headed. The bootleg can have blockers similar to a \"sweep\" (and in such cases is it often called a \"quarterback sweep\") or it can be run \"naked\", that is without any blockers at all. A naked bootleg relies on the defense buying the fake handoff and moving to tackle the running back rather than the quarterback.\nQuarterback sneak.\nThe quarterback takes the snap and immediately dives to one side of the center or the other. This is often a short yardage play designed when only a yard or so is needed for a first down or a touchdown. Often the only players on either side of the ball that know the play is coming are the quarterback and the center (hence the \"sneak\" aspect of it), as the play is often decided by the quarterback upon seeing the defense. The play is often called by a silent signal between quarterback and center (a pinch or a tap in the direction the sneak is headed).\nEnd-around.\nThe wide receiver takes a handoff directly from the quarterback. The receiver then may proceed to do one of two things: he either runs the ball towards the line of scrimmage in order to gain yardage, or more rarely, he attempts to pass to another eligible pass receiver.\nReverse.\nThis play resembles a sweep, but before the running back crosses the line of scrimmage, he hands the ball off to a wide receiver going in the reverse (opposite) direction of where the running back was going. If the defense was drawn to the side of the field the running back was going towards, the receiver can outrun the defense to the other side of the field and make a big gain. When run like this, it is generally considered a trick play. However, it can also be run by putting a receiver in motion while the quarterback is under center, with the quarterback pitching the ball to the receiver behind him.\nOption.\nAn option play is a play in which the quarterback holds the ball and runs to either side of the offensive line, waiting for an opportunity to run upfield and advance the ball. At the same time, the running back follows, allowing the quarterback the 'option' of pitching the ball just before he is tackled. This tactic forces defensive players to commit to either preventing the pitch or tackling the quarterback, allowing the offensive team to choose the best result. \nThe option play requires a very fast and mobile quarterback to execute it, and employs a considerable deal of risk, because if the pitch is mishandled it is a live ball that can be recovered by the defense, plus the quarterback can be hurt.\nThe option is rarely seen outside of college football, as high school teams lack the skill to execute it properly, and defensive players on professional teams are quick enough to disrupt the play to the point that it doesn't merit the risk involved, until the increased usages of read-option and RPO offenses in NFL since the 2010s with increasing number of dual-threat quarterbacks. \nCollege football teams West Virginia, Air Force, Florida in 2000s often employ this play style. \nA common form of the option executed on the high school, collegiate, and occasionally professional levels is the veer.\nPassing plays.\nGo.\nA \"go\", \"seam\" or \"fly route\" is a deep route used typically when the receiver has a speed advantage over the defensive back. In the route, the receiver will run as fast as possible in straight line parallel to the sideline, in an attempt to outrun the defender who is covering them.\nPost.\nA post is a deep play where wide receivers run straight down the field a short distance (10-15 yards), and then angle in toward the center of the field (toward the goal 'posts') where the ball is caught at high speed. When this play was originally designed, the goal posts were on the \"zero\" yard line, in the front of the endzone - thus, a cornerback in man coverage would be led into the post.\nIn a skinny post, the route is shorter and quicker than a deep post, which may cover 30 or 40 yards. This may also be referred to as a \"glance in\" or a \"bang eight.\"\nOut.\nAn out route will usually feature the receiver running 7 to 10 yards downfield and then making a 90 degree turn towards the sideline.-.\nIn/Drag/Dig.\nThe In, Drag, or Dig route is the opposite of the Out route. As its name suggests, the route will usually feature the receiver running 7 to 10 yards downfield and then making a 90 degree turn towards the center of the field.\nSlant.\nA slant is where a receiver will run straight, (5-8 yards) then take a hard turn left/right.\nHook/Hitch.\nAn eligible receiver runs a predetermined number of steps or yards upfield before stopping and turning back in slightly to face the quarterback, in the hopes that the defender cannot react and disrupt the pass before positive yardage\nArrow.\nA flat route is named after the area of the field where it takes place. During a typical play, due to the routes of other receivers, there is an area of the field that is vacated. This area known as the \"flats\" is typically from the hash marks to the sideline and from the line of scrimmage to 3-5 yards downfield. The route itself may be executed several ways. The most common is also known as the arrow. This consists of a receiver lining up near the offensive tackle and then taking a short angled path directly to this area. Running backs often will execute a special flat route that involves them running toward the sideline without the ball from the backfield and then turning upfield as a receiver. This is often referred to as a swing route.\nOption routes.\nParticularly in the highest levels of competition (professional and major college), a play may call for the receiver to 'read' the defensive coverage against him, and run a second route if the first option would be ineffectual. As an example, the receiver may be instructed to begin with a slant route, but if the defender has that covered, switch to an out route. For this to work correctly, the passer must make the same read as the receiver.\nScreen pass.\nA screen pass is a pass that is normally thrown to a receiver or running back behind the line of scrimmage. It is thrown behind the line of scrimmage so that the pulling linemen can get their blocks established. There is another screen called a bubble screen where there are 3 receivers bunched together to one side, and after the snap the ball is almost instantly thrown to the one farthest behind the line of scrimmage.\nPlay-action.\nThe quarterback takes the snap and drops back to fake a handoff to the running back. The quarterback then rapidly pulls the ball back from the faked handoff, trying to hide it from the defense. The running back continues to move upfield as if he has the ball in his hands. The offensive line starts to run block, but then quickly goes into pass protection.\nThe receivers appear to block at first, then go into their routes.\nOn a play-action pass, which is essentially the opposite of the draw play, the quarterback hopes to fake the defenders into thinking the offense is going to run the ball. The effects of this play is to slow down the pass rush of the defense and it forces the defensive backs to make a decision between covering a receiver or coming up to help stop the run.\nTrick/Gadget plays.\nTrick/Gadget plays are plays that are designed to appear to be one type of play while in reality is another. These plays typically will catch defenses off guard. The most common example is the reverse play. Other examples of trick plays are the Halfback Pass or Razzle Dazzle (Where the running back will pretend to run the ball, but instead throws it to a receiver down field), the Flea flicker (The quarterback hands the ball off to the running back who in turns pitches it back to the quarterback who then throws it to a receiver down field), the Hook and Ladder, also known as the Hook and Lateral (One receiver runs a hook route and upon catching the ball, laterals it to another teammate as he passes him running down the field), and the double pass, where the quarterback throws a lateral to one player, who then throws a forward pass downfield. A notable example of a trick play is the touchdown pass to Hines Ward (Steelers) in Super Bowl XL. The Seahawks' Jon Ryan threw a touchdown to Garry Gilliam in the 2015 NFC Championship Game.\nDefensive plays.\nRush.\nA pass rush (or, colloquially, 'pressure,' e.g., \"Chicago really brought the pressure on that last play\") occurs when the defense reads a pass play and elects to rush some combination of linemen (either 3 or 4 linemen in typical 3-4 or 4-3 schemes), in an effort to affect the pass that the opposing quarterback is attempting to complete. Perhaps the most obvious and tangible result of a successful pass rush is the sack, but even when the quarterback is not sacked, \"hurries\" and \"knockdowns\" are also important, as they also serve to disrupt in some manner the pass attempt. A \"hurry\" occurs when the quarterback is still able to make a throw, but is forced to throw before he would ideally like (e.g., before all of his receivers have completed running their routes). A \"knockdown\" occurs when the quarterback is still able to make a throw, but is knocked to the ground immediately upon making his throw because the rushing linemen were so close to him. Knockdowns and hurries can also serve to force the quarterback into making bad decisions, which could possibly result in interceptions for the defense.\nStunts.\nStunts are a special means of rushing the quarterback done to confuse the opposing team's offensive line. Properly executing a stunt requires two or more defensive lineman working together. One defensive lineman will take an angled path towards an offensive lineman that he is not lined up across from. This will usually cause the offensive lineman he is lined up across from to follow him while also occupying the offensive lineman he angled towards. In turn, the defensive lineman who would have been blocked by the offensive lineman that is being angled to will loop behind his teammate and rush through the gap that was created by the offensive lineman who followed the defensive lineman taking the angle.\n E T | G C G T W\n / | / \\\n DE |NT DL DE\n |______|\nBlitz.\nA blitz occurs when the defense sends non defensive-line personnel (either linebackers or defensive backs) to rush the quarterback. A blitz is an expansion upon the effective concept of the aforementioned pass rush.\nMore plays.\nIn attempting to halt the advancing of the football by the offensive team, the defensive team has many options. There are various formations that are commonly employed to defend against a passing attack.\nMan-to-man.\nMan-to-man coverage is when every receiver is covered by a defensive back or linebacker. It is a coverage often used while blitzing because there are not enough players available to effectively execute zone coverage. Man-to-man coverage may be used while not blitzing by teams who have superior defensive backs or against teams with inferior receivers.\nZone.\nZone defense is when defensive players (typically defensive backs and linebackers) are responsible for a specific area on the field during pass coverage. Zones are usually more effective against long passes. When playing in a zone defense, a defensive player is able to observe what the quarterback is attempting to do, anticipate where a pass may be thrown, and perhaps intercept the pass. Zone defenses tend to produce interceptions of passes or outstanding collisions with receivers after they have made pass receptions."

        "title": "Tom Crean (basketball)",
        "text": "Thomas Aaron Crean (born March 25, 1966) is a college basketball coach. Most recently, he was the head coach for the University of Georgia men's basketball team. Crean was previously the head coach of Indiana University. Prior to that, he served as head coach at Marquette University (1999–2008), where his team reached the 2003 NCAA Final Four.\nCrean's basketball philosophy emphasizes fast breaks and transition offense. His guidance of the Indiana program to success from \"unthinkable depths\" was regarded as one of the most remarkable rebuilding projects in NCAA basketball history. In 2012, he was named the mid-season Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year, the \"Sporting News\" Big Ten Coach of the Year, and the ESPN.com National Coach of the Year. In 2016, Crean was named by the coaches and media the Big Ten Coach of the Year after coaching Indiana to their second outright Big Ten regular-season championship in four years.\nPersonal life.\nCrean was born and raised in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, where he played basketball for four years. According to Crean, \"I didn't play a lot, although my coach called me his biggest tool, but I knew I wanted to coach.\" While a student at Central Michigan University, Crean was an assistant coach at Mount Pleasant High School for five seasons, and at Alma College. Crean received his bachelor's degree in parks-and-recreation studies from Central Michigan in 1989.\nCrean is married to Joani Harbaugh, whom he met while an assistant to Ralph Willard at Western Kentucky University (WKU) through a mutual friend, Ron Burns, at a gym where she was working as an aerobics instructor. Her father, Jack Harbaugh, was the head football coach at WKU at the time Crean was an assistant basketball coach there. She is also the sister of the first pair of brothers in NFL history to serve as head coaches: Baltimore Ravens head football coach John Harbaugh and Los Angeles Chargers head football coach Jim Harbaugh. Crean and his wife have three children: Megan, Riley, and Ainsley. Riley was a right handed pitcher for the Georgia Bulldogs baseball team in 2019. Crean is a Christian.\nAssistant coaching career.\nCrean spent two stints at Michigan State, first during the 1989-1990 season as a graduate assistant under then head coach Jud Heathcote at the behest of then assistant coach Tom Izzo, whom Crean had befriended on the summer camp circuit. From 1990 to 1994 Crean served as the associate head coach under Ralph Willard at Western Kentucky. When Willard left Western Kentucky to become head coach at Pittsburgh in 1994, Crean was considered to replace him as head coach. Ultimately Crean followed Willard to Pittsburgh, serving as associate head coach for one year.\nIn 1995, Crean returned to Michigan State as assistant coach under the leadership of Tom Izzo. Izzo and Crean became such good friends that Crean lived in Izzo's house and Izzo was an usher in Crean's wedding. According to Crean at the time, \"It was a great opportunity for me to go back home. We've been friends a long time. I don't think I would have left Ralph for anything else.\" During this period Crean served at various times as recruiting coordinator and, for the last two seasons, associate head coach. In each of Crean's four seasons, Michigan State's win total increased, culminating with a 33-5 season and a 15-1 Big Ten ledger in 1999. Michigan State later went on to honor Crean with a 2000 National Championship ring; even though he wasn't on the staff at the time, he'd helped recruit and develop many of the players on the title team.\nMarquette University.\nOn March 30, 1999, Crean was named head coach at Marquette University. According to Crean, \"Once Marquette became available, that's where my sights were. I had unbelievable respect for the tradition and the name. When I thought of Marquette, I thought of a true basketball school and to me that had a lot to do with it.\" Crean immediately made a number of changes at Marquette, creating a new team image by increasing the significance of the team's media day and instituting a \"Midnight Madness\" event commonly held by schools on the night teams are allowed to begin practice. Crean's first recruiting class was considered by experts to be among the top twenty in the country, Marquette's first in a long time.\nIn his nine years with Marquette, Crean's teams earned five NCAA Tournament bids, one more than the previous four Marquette coaches had in the 16 years prior to his arrival. During his tenure there Crean recruited, developed and coached a number of skilled players that made significant contributions in both the NCAA and NBA, including Dwyane Wade, Dominic James, Steve Novak, Wesley Matthews, and Travis Diener.\nOver his final seven seasons at Marquette, Crean compiled an aggregate record of 160-68 (.702). The 2002-03 season was one of the best in Marquette history. The team made a Final Four appearance for the first time since winning the NCAA Championship in 1977. Crean has referred to the team's run as \"one of the greatest four or five days of my life.\"\nLater that year, Marquette accepted an offer to leave Conference USA for the Big East Conference after the 2004–2005 season. Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese cited his friendship with Crean as contributing to the invitation, saying, \"That, to me, was one of the great appeals, to get Tommy as well as Marquette into the league.\"\nIndiana University.\nOn April 1, 2008, Crean was hired as head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers, succeeding interim head coach Dan Dakich. Dakich had replaced former coach Kelvin Sampson, who resigned after NCAA recruiting violations. Between Crean's hiring and the start of the 2008–09 season, freshman Eric Gordon opted to leave early for the NBA and star forward DJ White graduated. Two players kicked off the team by Dakich were not allowed back by Crean, one was dismissed by Crean and two transferred. As a result, Crean began with a roster consisting only of two walk-ons who had scored a combined 36 points in their careers. Despite the long odds, Crean was known to approach games and practices as if Indiana could compete in each one and to continue stressing Hoosier Hysteria and the long tradition of success at the school. He was well aware that he was walking into a difficult situation. However, when asked why he left Marquette, Crean replied, \"It's Indiana. It's Indiana, and that is the bottom line.\"\nWith a depleted roster and reduced recruiting allure, Crean's first three seasons saw consecutive losing records of 6–25 (the worst in school history), 10–21, and 12–20. However, during this period Crean's recruiting classes progressively improved, most notably with the signing of five-star recruit and McDonald's All-American Cody Zeller, an Indiana native. Zeller was the highest ranked recruit to join the Indiana program since the Sampson era.\nDespite his difficult early years at Indiana, Crean did much to establish goodwill with the fans. For instance, at the first \"Midnight Madness\" festivities before his first season, Crean brought back \"Martha the Mop Lady,\" the subject of a popular ad that opened Hoosier basketball games on WTTV for 30 years. It featured a cleaning lady whistling \"Indiana, Our Indiana\" while cleaning Assembly Hall. Since the actress who had appeared in the original ads was unavailable, singer Sheila Stephen stepped in as the new Martha. Starting with the 2010–11 season, video of the original ad was shown at home games after the National Anthem and right before tip off. Later, the video was shown just before the Hoosiers took the court.\nThe 2011–12 season was a watershed one for Crean and the program, which saw a 27–9 record and a sweet 16 appearance. The season also saw home wins over #1-ranked Kentucky (on a buzzer-beater at the end of regulation), #2-ranked Ohio State, and #5-ranked Michigan State. This made Crean the first Indiana coach to defeat the #1- and #2-ranked teams in the same season and the first Indiana squad ever to defeat three programs ranked in the top five in a single season. The Hoosiers earned a number four seed in the 2012 NCAA tournament and defeated New Mexico State in the Round of 64. After defeating VCU in the Round of 32, the Hoosiers lost in the Sweet Sixteen to rival Kentucky, who would go on to win the national championship.\nThe fifteen game win improvement in 2011–12 was the largest single turnaround in the NCAA that season. Crean's guidance of the program to success from \"unthinkable depths\" was widely regarded as one of the most remarkable rebuilding projects in NCAA basketball history. As a result, he was named the mid-season Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year, the \"Sporting News\" Big Ten Coach of the Year, and the ESPN.com National Coach of the Year.\nFor the 2012–13 season, Crean signed five highly touted recruits, self-dubbed \"The Movement.\" Combined with the returning players from the previous season, Indiana dominated the college basketball landscape, spending 10 weeks ranked #1 in the country and all but two weeks in the top 5. The Hoosiers won their first outright Big Ten regular season title in 20 years, and garnered a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, also their first in 20 years. The team, led by seniors Christian Watford and Jordan Hulls, along with eventual top-five NBA draft picks Victor Oladipo and Cody Zeller, advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament before losing to eventual Final Four participant Syracuse. The next two seasons, 2013–14 and 2014–15, the Hoosiers slipped to records of 17–15 and 20–14 with eighth and seventh-place finishes in the Big Ten, respectively. Despite these low finishes and player arrests, Crean was retained after appearing on many media \"hot seat\" lists. After a slow start to the 2015–16 season, Crean and the Hoosiers would eventually go on to be outright Big Ten Regular Season Champions and Crean was named by the coaches and media the Big Ten Coach of the Year. During the 2016–17 season, the Hoosiers missed the NCAA Tournament for the 5th time in nine years under Crean despite being ranked #3 in the AP Poll earlier in the season and finished with an 18–16 record, losing in the first round of the NIT to Georgia Tech.\nCrean was fired by Indiana on March 16, 2017.\nUniversity of Georgia.\nOn March 15, 2018, Crean was named head coach of the Georgia Bulldogs. In Crean's four seasons, the Bulldogs went 47-75 overall and 15-57 in SEC play.\nThey went just 6-26 (1-17 in the SEC) during the 2021-2022 season. On March 10, 2022, Crean was fired by Georgia.\nCoaching style and philosophy.\nCrean's basketball philosophy emphasizes fast breaks and deflections. On offense, he has a reputation for the magnitude of his offensive sets and their multitude of options, with one opposing coach estimating about 400 different sets run. Shot selection is extremely important, with a focus on spacing, inside-out attacks, penetration and kick. Crean utilizes the halfcourt defense which requires great ball pressure, help from teammates, challenging shots, and defensive rebounding.\nCrean is considered an excellent recruiter and one of college basketball's best talent evaluators. A hallmark of Crean's programs is the notion that players are joining a family and making sure that players' families are involved in the program. Crean is also known to excel in public relations. At Marquette he began the tradition of Midnight Madness, which was seen as an immediate success. Between 1999 and 2006, Marquette saw a 70% overall increase in attendance, three total attendance records broken, and 1.5 million fans pass through the turnstiles.\nOn the court Crean is known to walk the sidelines with an intensity normally reserved for football coaches. For inspiration, Crean has a library filled with biographies of coaches and business executives, with favorites being Jim Collins' management guide \"Good to Great\" and the story of Bill Belichick's rise in New England, \"Patriot Reign\".\nDuring his time at Indiana, Crean was criticized by fans and local sports media for the amount of turnovers his teams committed, poor defense, lack of team fundamentals, poor in-state recruiting, large numbers of players transferring, and his \"blow-by\" handshakes of opposing coaches.\nAwards and recognition.\nCrean has been chosen to coach a number of national teams. In 2001, he was selected by USA Basketball as one of eight coaches. In 2004, he served as an assistant coach for USA Basketball's under-20 team in the FIBA Americas World Championship. The team won its second title since the tournament."

        "title": "DCU Saints (American football)",
        "text": "The Dublin City University Saints was a former American football team of Dublin City University, Ireland. Established in 2005, the DCU Saints initially competed in the Irish American Football League (IAFL) for five seasons, reaching the playoffs in 2008 and 2009. The team collapsed following the conclusion of the league's 2010 season, before attempting to unsuccessfully reform for the 2013 season.\nColours.\nThe DCU Saints followed a similar colour scheme to other DCU clubs: royal blue and gold. The team had both home and away strips: the home being navy blue and gold; the away white and gold.\nHistory.\n2005.\nThe DCU American Football club was established in 2005 by Carl Rushe and Maurice Cosgrave. The club initially provided flag football training and access to some of the NFL games. As with all new clubs and societies DCU the club had to undergo a probationary period. During this time the club was focused on allowing fans of the sport learn more about it and to establish itself as a viable club in the University.\n2006.\nIn 2006, interest in the club increased immensely; over 150 students signed up to the club at the start of the University year and this figure rose to close to 180 by the end. In 2006 the club also applied to and was accepted by the IAFL and began training DCU's first ever fully kitted American Football team, the DCU Saints. For the 2006 season the club also managed to secure some of the most experienced and well-regarded coaches in Ireland including Team Ireland Head Coach Phil De Monte, Team Ireland Defensive Co-ordinator Darrin O'Toole and German League coach Carsten Wunderlich. Also in 2006 the DCU Cheerleading Squad was formed with the assistance of DCU Dance.\nTowards the end of 2006 the club was honoured with an award from DCU and the Sports Clubs Committee (SCC) at the annual Clubs &amp; Societies Awards; the \"Most Improved Club 2006\" award which recognises the considerable development undergone by the club in the past year. Additionally, club Secretary and co-founder Maurice Cosgrave was awarded the Best Individual Administrator Award.\n2007.\n2007 was a development year for the DCU Saints. With a new coaching and management staff in place, the team focused on developing experienced players and passing on this experience to new players. This was evident in the improvement of our record this year with two wins, both against two established teams.\n2008.\nThis year marks a fresh start for the Saints. With a greater influx of players and increasing win record, the Saints have shown the ability and the drive to improve again.\nThe season started badly with a loss to the Carrickfergus Knights but the team started 11 rookies that day and stayed close to the experienced Knights which gave hope for the future.\nThe game against Tallaght Outlaws was dominated by the weather, with storms turning the pitch into a quagmire. The Saints took a while to get going, particularly on offence, but when they clicked they ran away with the game, racking up a record 44 points while not conceding a score.\nThe victory gave the team added confidence and they followed up with a victory over the Rhinos, 32-3. Again the team took time to get going on offence but eventually clicked to run away easy winners, the Rhinos score only coming after a botched call by the officials.\nThe two games against Dublin Rebels showed the team had a lot to learn and must front up more if they are to win a game against one of the big three (Rebels, UL, Cork)\nThe team got back into the groove again with a second victory over the Rhinos, this time the passing game working perfectly with David Mullins a particular standout. The Rhinos scored a touchdown on a controversial call by the officials but it did not matter as the Saints scored five touchdowns. \nOn 29 June, the Saints beat Belfast in Belfast by a score of 6-0 to clinch a wildcard spot in the playoffs for the first time in their history. They travelled to Cork to face the Admirals having lost their last regular season game to UL Vikings, finishing the regular season 4-4.\nIn Cork, the Saints lost their first ever play-off game by a score of 34-2 to bring to end their best season to date.\n2009.\nThe DCU Saints started the 2009 season on 29 March 2009 at home against the Dublin Rhinos. A close game ended 18-18 (which included Saints linebacker Conor Tyrrell blocking an extra point attempt) and DCU were off to a good start. This good start was undone a week later in Carrickfergus when the Knights beat DCU 19-6, the Saints sole score coming from a fumble recovered by linebacker Joe Carlyle.\nTwo weeks later, DCU disimproved to 0-2-1 on the year as they were forced to forfeit a game against league Champions, UL Vikings. DCU snapped their two-game losing streak 26-22 against the visiting Belfast Trojans with Dave McMahon returning a punt over 80 yards for 6 and a stand out performance from Eoin Fox at linebacker and followed this up with a strong 22-14 victory over the Rhinos in Castleknock, pushing DCU over for the season with RB Dave McMahon and WR Geoff Coleman accumulating the majority of the Saint’s points and Gary Fogarty having a stellar game at OLB &amp; DE.\nDCU came crashing back down to earth at the end of May when Cork destroyed the visitors by 52-0 in a lopsided win. Two weeks later, DCU lost again, this time to the Dublin Rebels, by 27-6. Going into the final game of the regular season, DCU (in a mirror image of the 2008 season, against the Belfast Bulls) needed to beat a team who had beaten them earlier on in the year, the Cork Admirals. DCU duly complied, in a defensive battle in which DCU got their only shut-out of the season and earned a tough fought 8-0 victory to qualify for the post season for the second time in their history while simultaneously ensuring Cork would fail to make the playoffs.\nIn the playoffs, DCU faced an impressive Dublin Rebels team in the semi-finals. The Rebels proved to be too impressive, routing DCU in a 38-0 loss. The disappointing loss ended DCU’s season, which was their best season in the club’s history.\n2013.\nAfter a 3-year absence from the IAFL, DCU attempted to re-enter the IAFL Shamrock Bowl Conference in 2013 but disbanded prior to the start of the season."

        "text": "Hampshire county cricket teams have been traced back to the 18th century but the county's involvement in cricket goes back much further than that. Given that the first definite mention of cricket anywhere in the world is dated c.1550 in Guildford, in neighbouring Surrey, it is almost certain that the game had reached Hampshire by the 16th century.\n17th century.\nAs elsewhere in south east England, cricket became established in Hampshire during the 17th century and the earliest village matches took place before the English Civil War. It is believed that the earliest county teams were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660.\nA Latin poem by Robert Matthew in 1647 contains a probable reference to cricket being played by pupils of Winchester College on nearby St Catherine's Hill. If authentic, this is the earliest known mention of cricket in Hampshire. But with the sport having originated in Saxon or Norman times on the Weald, it must have reached Hampshire long before 1647.\nIn 1680, lines written in an old Bible invite \"All you that do delight in Cricket, come to Marden, pitch your wickets\". Marden is in West Sussex, north of Chichester, and close to Hambledon, which is just across the county boundary in Hampshire.\n18th century.\nHampshire was used in a team name for the first time in August 1729, when a combined Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex XI played against Kent.\nThe earliest known cricket match to have been played in Hampshire took place on Tues 22 May 1733. It was at Stubbington, near Portsmouth, between Married v Single. The Married team won. Details were found by Martin Wilson in the \"American Weekly Mercury\", a Philadelphia newspaper dated 20 to 27 September 1733. Wilson subsequently found an earlier version of the report in an English newspaper, the 18 June 1733 edition of \"Parker's Penny Post\".\nHambledon Club.\nThe origin of the Hambledon Club is lost and there is no definite knowledge of Hambledon cricket before 1756 when its team had gained sufficient repute to be capable of attempting three matches against Dartford, which had been a famous club since the 1720s if not earlier. It is not known when the Hambledon Club was founded and it seems likely that some kind of parish organisation was operating in 1756, although there may well have been a patron involved.\nThe Sussex v Hampshire match in June 1766 is the earliest reference to Hampshire as an individual county team. Some historians believe it was at about this time that the club, as distinct from a parish organisation, was founded. Hampshire teams in the 18th century have first-class status.\nThe Hambledon Club was in many respects a Hampshire county club for it organised Hampshire matches, although it was a multi-functional club and not dedicated to cricket alone. Its membership attracted large numbers of sporting gentry and it dominated the sport, both on and off the field, for about thirty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1787. Hambledon produced Hampshire players including batsman John Small and the two fast bowlers Thomas Brett and David Harris.\n19th century.\nFollowing the demise of the Hambledon Club towards the end of the 18th century, Hampshire continued to be recognised as a first-class county team into the 19th century. After the 1828 season, Hampshire had long spells without any first-class matches until the county club was founded in 1864. The county played some first-class fixtures during 1842 to 1845 and one match versus MCC in 1861 but was otherwise outside cricket's mainstream through 1829 to 1863. Hampshire County Cricket Club was founded on 12 August 1863 and played its initial first-class match against Sussex at the Antelope Ground, Southampton on 7 and 8 July 1864.\nVenues.\nHampshire played their home matches prior to the formation of Hampshire County Cricket Club at the following grounds:"

England won the first, at Edgbaston, by the decisive margin of nine wickets, and the rain-affected second Test at Lord's was drawn, but any English optimism was short-lived. Australia won the next three games by huge margins to secure the series and retain The Ashes, and England's three-day victory in the final game at The Oval was little more than a consolation prize.

The combination of captain Matthew Maynard and Steve James' batting and Waqar Younis' and Steve Watkin's bowling propelled them to the title, although the matter was not settled until the final match of the season, when Glamorgan's maximum-points thrashing of Somerset at Taunton ensured that Kent's own victory over Surrey was irrelevant.\nIn one-day cricket, Warwickshire won the AXA Life League by two points from Kent, but were themselves thrashed by nine wickets by Essex in the final of the NatWest Trophy.

        "text": "The 1994 Vancouver Stanley Cup Riot occurred in Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on the evening of June 14, 1994, and continued into the following morning. The riot followed Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals in which the Vancouver Canucks lost to the New York Rangers. It was Vancouver's first riot since 1972, when the Rolling Stones American Tour 1972 led to confrontations between the police and 2,000 outside the Pacific Coliseum.\nThe riot.\nAfter the NHL game ended, an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 individuals converged upon Downtown Vancouver. The gathering developed into a riot at Robson and Thurlow Street, after an accident involving a man who fell from telephone pole wires into the crowd below. The police, who were on bicycles, attempted to escort paramedics into the crowd. When members of the crowd attempted to take a bicycle from one constable, police retreated and warned the crowd to disperse. Shortly after the riot squad congregated on Thurlow St. on the West side, police fired tear gas into the crowd, causing people to run in all directions. Windows of many major retailers along Robson were broken, including an Eaton's department store which had more than 50 smashed. The storefronts were eventually guarded by a constable as police regained control of the streets.\nTear gas wafted through the open windows of West End residents that night. St. Paul's Hospital responded to the situation by placing guards at the emergency room entrance to prevent tear gas victims from entering, claiming there was nothing that could be done for them. Eventually, as reported in \"The New York Times\", bowls with water were placed outside by the security guards for those suffering from tear gas. Total damage to the downtown core was estimated at $1.1 million Canadian dollars.\nSubduing the crowd required the direct involvement of over 540 officers, of the Vancouver Police Department and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Numerous individuals were arrested and charged, and up to 200 people were injured.\nAftermath.\nRyan Berntt, a rioter who was shot in the head with a plastic bullet by police, causing a four-week coma and permanent brain damage, filed a civil suit against police and the City of Vancouver claiming excessive force. In 1997, he was found 75 percent liable for his own injuries, however, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ordered a new trial in 1999. In 2001, Berntt's civil suit was dismissed by the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nIn New York City, although the celebrations marking the Rangers' first championship in 54 years were peaceful and there were no reports of violence or arrests, they were marred by the Vancouver riots. Rudy Giuliani, who became the city's mayor just five months before, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, and Rangers President and General Manager Neil Smith said that the Rangers and people in New York City were in shock over the news of the riots and that the shockwaves of it had travelled to the city and put it on the highest alert. Bratton cancelled days off for the New York City Police Department on June 17, 1994, the day of the parade for the Rangers, as a precaution against what happened in Vancouver happening in New York City.\nDuring their broadcast of the post-game celebrations following Game 7, \"Hockey Night in Canada\"’s Ron MacLean said when the network broadcast scenes outside Madison Square Garden that the NYPD avoided a large-scale riot by \"continuing to bolster their situation in anticipation of a wild night in Manhattan.\"\nSeventeen years later, the Canucks played the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals. They again lost in Game 7, on June 15, 2011, resulting in a similar riot.\nIn popular culture.\nThe events of the riot were featured on reality television shows \"World's Wildest Police Videos\", \"World's Most Amazing Videos\" and \"Maximum Exposure\"."

He is the head football coach at Long Island University (LIU), a position he has held since the 2022 season. Cooper served as the head football coach at Eastern Michigan University from 1993 to 1994, the University of Louisville from 1995 to 1997, and Alabama A&amp;M University from 1998 to 2001. He was also the interim head football coach at Florida International University (FIU) for the final eight games of the 2016 season. Cooper worked one season in the National Football League, as the defensive backs coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2012. A native of Huntsville, Alabama, Cooper played high school football at Lee High School and college football at Jacksonville State University.\nCoaching career.\nEastern Michigan.\nCooper was the head football coach at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan, from 1993 to 1994. At Eastern Michigan, his teams produced a record of 9–13.\nLouisville.\nFrom 1995 to 1997 Cooper was the head football coach at the University of Louisville, replacing Howard Schnellenberger. In his final season, the Cardinals posted a 1–10 record. The one win came against Illinois who finished the season with no wins (0–11). Cooper's overall record at Louisville was 13–20. On November 19, 1997, Louisville fired Cooper due to a steady decline in the team's performance.\nAlabama A&amp;M.\nCooper's last head coaching position was at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, from 1998 to 2001. His squad won a division championship in Southwest Athletic Conference (SWAC) during the 2000 season but lost the SWAC Championship Game to Grambling on December 12, 2000.\nOther coaching duties.\nIn 2002, Cooper was the secondaries coach at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and in 2003 the defensive coordinator and safeties coach at Mississippi State. Other coaching stops have included the University of South Carolina and the University of Notre Dame. Cooper is an alumnus of Jacksonville State University.\nLSU.\nRon Cooper, coached the LSU Tigers defensive backs for three seasons.\nCooper had been responsible for overseeing perhaps the nation's top secondary in 2011 as the Tigers feature two national award winners in Morris Claiborne (Thorpe Award) and Tyrann Mathieu (Bednarik Award). Claiborne (SEC Coaches) and Mathieu (AP) each picked up SEC Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2011. It was the second straight year that LSU featured the Thorpe and Bednarik Award winners along with the SEC Defensive Player of the Year. Patrick Peterson claimed all three honors in 2010 before being taken with the fifth overall pick in the NFL Draft.\nAs a unit, LSU's secondary accounted for 16 interceptions, nine fumble recoveries and 12 forced fumbles as the Tigers led the nation in turnover margin (+1.69) and ranked fifth in total interceptions with 18. LSU allowed just seven passing touchdowns all season, the fewest by a Tiger team since limiting opponents to only five in 1989.\nIn his first two years with the Tigers, Cooper's expertise coaching the secondary was evident as LSU had one of the best defensive backfields in the country. LSU led the SEC and ranked 10th in the nation in pass defense allowing 169.8 yards per game.\nCooper's first year at LSU saw Peterson earn second team All-America honors, while safety Chad Jones was picked in the third round of the NFL Draft.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nCooper was hired by the Buccaneers on February 22, 2012, to be the team's defensive backs coach.\nFIU.\nIn 2015, Cooper became the defensive coordinator and associate head coach at Florida International University. Following Ron Turner's termination in September 2016, Cooper was named interim head coach.\nAlabama.\nOn March 1, 2021, it was reported that Cooper had taken a job as an analyst with the Crimson Tide.\nLong Island.\nIn January 2022, Cooper was hired as the new head coach of the Long Island Sharks."

        "title": "2006 UST Growling Tigers basketball team",
        "text": "The 2006 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented the University of Santo Tomas in the men's basketball tournament of the 69th season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines.\nThe Tigers defeated the Blue Eagles of the Ateneo de Manila University to win their nineteenth UAAP men's title, and their first since the 1996 season. Jervy Cruz was selected on the Mythical Five, and Jojo Duncil was named as the Most Valuable Player of the Finals.\nPreseason tournaments.\nAfter the expiration of head coach Nel Parado contract at the 2005 yearend, the university administration announced the hiring of former varsity and Ginebra San Miguel standout Pido Jarencio as the new head coach.\nThe Tigers participated in one off-season tournament: the Home and Away Invitational League (HAIL), where they were eliminated in the elimination round with a 3–4 record, good for fourth place, a game behind fourth seed Ateneo.\nSchedule.\nDue to the suspension of the De La Salle Green Archers, the league used a two-round, 12-game schedule, instead of the normal 14-game schedule.\nNotes: The July 14 game was postponed due to Tropical Storm Florita, while the September 28 game was postponed due to Typhoon Milenyo.\nGame summaries.\nFirst round.\nThe Tigers were ranked at the start of the season as at the middle, with neither being held as a favorite or as a cellar-dweller. Popular collegiate sports website \"UBelt.com\" placed UST to be fourth.\nUP Fighting Maroons.\nA seesaw game all throughout, the Tigers were on the verge of victory when Fighting Maroon Marvin Cruz converted a jump shot at the top of the key, giving the Maroons the victory.\nRookie Jervy Cruz was the top scorer for UST with 16 points. Marvin Cruz (no relation) top scored for UP, with 25 points.\nFEU Tamaraws.\nThe Tigers leaned on Dylan Ababou's three-point play with 8.6 seconds remaining to pull ahead of FEU for good.\nCruz and Duncil led all scorers with 25 points each. Duncil found a wide-open Ababou to cause the three-point play; the Tigers were ahead by 14 points but the Tamaraws fought back to tie at 87-all.\nUE Red Warriors.\nWith a strong second quarter, the Tigers pulled away from season host UE as they dumped the Warriors at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium. Duncil and Cruz stepped up as they led a 32–10 run at the second quarter to give a comfortable cushion for the rest of the game.\nDuncil scored 25 points, tying his career best. Cruz ended with a double-double of 22 points and ten rebounds.\nNU Bulldogs.\nBehind a strong outside presence, the NU Bulldogs repulsed the Growling Tigers in a high-scoring game. NU's one-two punch of Jonathan Fernandez and previous season's Mythical 5 awardee Edwin Asoro finished with a combined 44 points.\nThe Bulldogs converted 13 three-point field goals, a season record. Duncil made matters worse for the Tigers as he head-butted Dave Catamora with 52.9 seconds remaining.\nAdamson Soaring Falcons.\nBehind Adamson's run-and-gun offense, the Falcons made a big run at the second quarter to prevent the Tigers from catching up. Kenneth Bono, Leo Canuday and Roel Hugnatan stepped up for the Falcons as they scored a combined 59 points.\nAbabou top scored for the Tigers with 19 points, Cruz earned another double-double, with 11 points and 13 rebounds. Duncil served his one-game suspension while Cuan was injured.\nAteneo Blue Eagles.\nAteneo was assured of a first place at the end of the first round of eliminations, even though they were defeated in this game. However, the Eagles and the Tigers fought a close game, with Ateneo leading by a point at the end of the first quarter.\nBut it all changed in the second quarter as the Eagles pounced on the Tigers defense while limiting the Tigers in offense. By halftime, the game was over with Ateneo leading 63–36. All of the starters of Ateneo ended in double-figures, with Intal sharing game-high honors with Duncil, who was back from a one-game suspension, with 24 points.\nAteneo swept the first round of eliminations with an impressive 6–0 record.\nSecond round.\nThe Tigers started the second round tied for last place, along with the UP Fighting Maroons, NU Bulldogs and defending champions FEU Tamaraws. The Eagles are at the top of the pack with a 6–0 record. Two games behind are the Red Warriors, followed by the Adamson.\nUE Red Warriors.\nJust like in the last three games, the Tigers managed to keep at pace with the Red Warriors, but as terrible second quarter let them down again. Only nine suited up for the Tigers, though, due to injuries and other ailments.\nCruz had another double-double performance with 17 points and 15 rebounds. James Martinez of UE led all scorers with 19 points.\nNU Bulldogs.\nWith their Final Four aspirations in dire straits, the Tigers are in a must-win situation to have a fighting chance to reach the semifinal round.\nThe Tigers started passively, allowing he Bulldogs to lead at halftime. But the Tigers, due to the efforts of Cruz and Cuan, caught up with the Bulldogs at the end of the third quarter. Ababou finished the business for the Tigers as they outscored NU 43–27 at the second half.\nCruz led all scorers with 18 points, and achieved his seventh double-double of the season, raking in 13 rebounds.\nFEU Tamaraws.\nNow tied for fourth place, the Tigers are not out of the woods yet, especially at the logjam at the middle of table with Adamson, FEU and NU all having a chance of taking the last two semifinal berths – Ateneo and UE already clinched theirs.\nAnthony Espiritu stepped up his game as he compensated to Duncil's and Cortez's absence due to injuries and ailments, chipping in a career-high and tournament-best 31 points to lead the Tigers into a season sweep of the defending champions.\nThe Tigers move up to third place with a 4–5 record. Jeff Chan topscored for FEU with 21 points. Cruz had another double-double, with 11 points and 11 rebounds.\nSemifinals.\nAfter winning the classification game against Adamson, UST clinched the third seed, and the right to face the twice-to-beat UE Red Warriors in the semifinals.\nFirst game.\nPossessing the twice to beat advantage, the Warriors started passively, allowing UST to take the lead early on, with UST leading by six by halftime.\nAfter the halftime break, the game was tightly contested; however UST pulled away at the middle of the third quarter, but with UE overtaking the Tigers, at the end of the third quarter, with UE leading, 44–40. UST would then play their own version of catching up, with the Thomasians staying within striking distance. In a game of attacks and counterattacks, the Tigers unleashed a 5–0 run, leading by as much as eight points.\nThe Warriors wouldn't lose easily, as they did their own 8–2 run, cutting the UST lead into two points. With 21.1 seconds left, June Cortez drove hardly to the basket scoring a fieldgoal, plus a personal foul. Cortez sank his bonus freethrow as the Red Warriors failed to erase a four-point lead, giving the Tigers the win, and another game at Season 69.\nSecond game.\nWith the season on the line, the Growling Tigers and the Red Warriors faced off anew for the right to meet the Ateneo Blue Eagles in the Finals; Ateneo did not need their twice-to-beat advantage as they edged out Adamson, 76–73.\nPrior to the game, the Red Warriors announced the suspension of star player Bonifacio \"Bonbon\" Custodio due to disciplinary measures.\nJust like in the first game, it was tightly contested, but unlike it, this wasn't a game of attacks and counter-attacks, as neither team led by double digits, although UST led for much of the way at the first half.\nIn the second half, UST began creating inroads to the UE defense, leading by as much as fourteen. UE struck hard at the endgame, and led by five points. With the game on the line, Jojo Duncil, converted a fieldgoal off a Jervy Cruz put-back, plus a foul. Duncil converted his bonus freethrow to set up a thrilling last 53.8 seconds, with UST on the lead 82–79.\nOn the inbound play after the Duncil freethrow, Warriors Team Captain Robert Labagala drove unmolested into the basket, cutting the lead into one point. Trying to seal the game, the Tigers committed a turnover, and with no timeouts on both sides, the Red Warriors sprinted onto their frontcourt. With UST's transition defense sprinting along, Jorel Canizares managed to attempt a jumpshot on the right quartercourt. The shot bounced off the rim, with Canizares getting his own rebound. He missed his shot yet again, when UE captain Rob Labagala getting the rebound as time expired.\nThe Thomasians go into their first UAAP men's basketball Finals since 1999. The Warriors were booted out of the semifinals yet again, the third time since the Final Four era when they acquired the twice-to-beat incentive.\nFinals.\nThe Finals series between UST and Ateneo favored the Blue Eagles, as they have figured in more playoff games, and had a championship experience. UST was the underdog in the series.\nIt would be the first time that the Tigers and the Eagles met in a UAAP men's basketball final; the last time they have met was in the 1931 NCAA season where the Blue and White dethroned the Gold and White.\nGame one.\nWith several lead changes, the ga came on to the final two possessions. With Ateneo leading by one point, 71–70, J.C. Intal of Ateneo committed a backing violation. UST coach Pido Jarencio then called a timeout to design a play. After the timeout, Jervy Cruz had a hard time penetrating the Blue Eagle defense. He kicked out the ball to a tightly-guarded Allan Evangelista. With Doug Kramer covering him, Evangelista converted a fadeaway jumper, to put UST up, 72–71, with one second remaining.\nAteneo head coach Norman Black (a former varsity player of St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia) sued for time. Devising one the plays he previously used the head coach of the professional team San Miguel Beermen, he instructed Chris Tiu to set a pick for Doug Kramer in order to free him from his defender right under the basket. Tigers coach Pido Jarencio (who used to play for Norman Black on his rookie year at San Miguel Beer, and was a Glowing Goldie, the Tigers previous moniker) instructed his boys to implement the man-to-man defense.\nMacky Escalona inbounded the ball from the left side of center line. With Tiu setting a pick that separated Japs Cuan from defending Doug Kramer, Escalona passed the ball to the free Kramer and calmly converted his fieldgoal attempt, sending the Ateneo fans into pandemonium.\nGame two.\nThe second game was originally scheduled for September 28, but due to Typhoon Milenyo causing a direct hit to Metro Manila by the time of the game, the UAAP Board rescheduled the second game to September 30, at the Araneta Coliseum.\nAt the first quarter, the Tigers got off to a hot start, but Ateneo rallied. However, as the quarter concluded, the Tigers hanged on to a one-point lead. The Eagles would lose steam as bad plays and turnovers ruined their offensive flow, while the Tigers began hitting outside shots and grabbing offensive rebounds to negate the Eagles' zone defense. The Eagles would remain within striking distance thanks to J.C. Intal, but without support from his teammates, Intal's one-man show was not enough as Tigers Dylan Ababou and Jojo Duncil both surpassed the twenty-point barrier, leading into an easy 16-point win.\nGame three.\nUST opened the game with a 4–0 lead, barely two minutes into the game, before Ateneo countered, using a 6–2 run, with Macky Escalona's fastbreak lay-up to tie the game at 6. Later on, with the game tied at 10, Ateneo ran off five straight points to grab a 15–10 lead, with 3:07 left in the first. The Tigers rallied with a 5–2 burst, cutting Ateneo's lead to two at the end of the quarter.\nThe Blue Eagles started with a 10–4 run to open the second quarter, stretching the lead to eight, 27–19, as well as putting UST in the penalty. The Tigers misfired on their field goals, and their four points were all from the free throw line during this stretch. The Tigers regrouped, rallying to within three at 34–31, before Ken Barracoso hit a three with less than a minute to go in the half, giving Ateneo a 37–31 lead, which they maintained until halftime.\nUST came out scorching in the third quarter, opening the second half with a 10–0 blitz to grab a 41–37 spread. Dylan Ababou started the burst with a triple from the right wing, then after Clifford Arao turned the ball over in Ateneo's next possession, Jun Cortes found Jervy Cruz under the basket for a lay-up that cut ADMU's lead to one.\nThe Tigers continued to pour it on, scoring five more unanswered points to grab a 41–37 lead, before the Eagles stopped the bleeding with a lay-up by Escalona. However, the Tigers were not done, going on another 7–0 run to stretch their lead to nine, 48–39 with 4:52 left, forcing Ateneo to call a timeout.\nAteneo came out aggressive from the timeout, drawing fouls and putting UST in penalty. Cruz, Evangelista, and Duncil were all in foul trouble with 3 each, slowing down their offense, and giving Ateneo more momentum. The Eagles ran off five straight points, and after the Tigers stopped the bleeding, Escalona fired a three-point shot with 1:13 remaining, then after UST came up empty again, drove into the lane from the left wing, converting a lay-up which pushed Ateneo to within 49–51. As the Tigers misfired on their free throws, Ateneo took advantage of this, finishing the quarter with an 11–3 windup, drawing them to within one at the end of the third, 51–50.\nNeither team could score in the first 3:35 of the quarter until Ababou hit an awkward shot that gave UST the first points of the fourth, as well as a three-point spread. Ateno countered with its four points of its own, and Doug Kramer's basket with 4:46 left gave them back the lead for the first time since early in the third quarter. JC Intal missed two free throws, and Allan Evangelista hit a jumper to swing the lead back to UST.\nAfter both teams traded baskets, however, Evangelista fouled out on UST's next possession, and Intal hit a three-pointer, giving the Eagles a 59–57 lead, which Escalona stretched to four later on with a jumper. Duncil then sank a jumper of his own off a crossover dribble to pull the Tigers within two, setting the stage for the crucial final minute and a half of regulation.\nWith less than a minute and a half left in the fourth quarter and his team leading by two, JC Intal drove past Dylan Ababou, drawing Jervy Cruz' fifth and last foul, converting the basket, and setting himself up for a three-point play. After sending Cruz to the bench for good, Intal converted the free throw to give the Blue Eagles a five-point lead, 64–59 with about a minute remaining.\nWith a two of UST's main players out of the game and five-point lead with just over a minute to go in regulation, Ateneo looked poised to end the match. But fate had other things in mind.\nOn UST's next possession, Anthony Espiritu faked his defender into the air then drained a critical triple to draw the Tigers to within two, with just over a minute left in the fourth. Intal drove to the basket in Ateneo's next play, but he missed the shot, and the rebound was controlled by Duncil. On the Tigers' possession, Intal committed a foul, giving UST an inbounds play with clock reading 43.5 seconds. Ateneo then used out of its two timeouts.\nDuncil caught the pass out of the inbound, but then missed a rushed layup from the right side. However, Mark Canlas grabbed the rebound and scored on a putback to tie the game at 64, with 37.3 seconds left in regulation. The Eagles, opting not to call their final timeout, brought the ball upcourt and isolated Intal at the top of the key. Intal drove into the lane but again missed his lay-up, and the ball was tipped to Duncil. He could not control the rebound, however, and Intal was able to force him to turn the ball over. With only 21 seconds remaining, Ateneo called a timeout to set up their final offensive play of regulation.\nIntal inbounded the ball to Escalona, who waited until about 11 seconds left before passing it to Chris Tiu, who in turn passed it to Intal on the left wing. He drove into the lane once more, but he again missed the shot, and Japs Cuan threw up a halfcourt shot that missed as time expired. Game 3 had gone into overtime.\nBoth teams started off cold in the overtime period, unable to score on their initial possessions. After Doug Kramer missed a shot on Ateneo's second possession, Japs Cuan brought the ball up and was fouled by Yuri Escueta. Since both teams were in the penalty, this sent UST's floor general to the free throw line. Cuan split his free throws, giving the Tigers a one-point lead.\nAteneo came up empty again on their next play, then Kramer fouled June Dizon on UST's possession. Dizon, though, missed both free throws, and Escalona hit another three, giving him 26 points and the Eagles their first lead of the period. Duncil answered right away with a jumper to tie the game again, then after Intal turned the ball over on Ateneo's next possession, Cuan was fouled anew, and once again split his free throws.\nOn the Eagles next possession, Escalona faked his defender into the air then drove into the lane for a difficult lay-up to give the Eagles back the lead, 69–68. Duncil tried to answer on the Tigers' next possession, but he air-balled a three-pointer. Duncil though, chased down his own miss, and drew a foul from Chris Tiu. He then knocked in both shots to swing the lead back to his team.\nAfter Escalona missed a three, Ababou stole Kramer's pass and brought the ball into UST's attack zone. Duncil faked off Barracoso behind the three-point arc, then dribbled closer to sink another jumper which gave the Tigers a three-point lead, 72–69, with just over a minute remaining. As the yellow side of the arena grew louder, Chris Tiu sank a three-pointer of his own off an assist pass from JC Intal to tie the game again at 72, forcing UST to call a timeout with 55 seconds left.\nThe Tigers ran an isolation play for Duncil in the right wing against Escalona. Duncil drove into the lane, faked Escalona into the air, then drained yet another jumper to give UST a two-point lead. Intal answered on Ateneo's next play, driving into the lane and laying it in, tying the game anew at 74. The Eagles defended Duncil well on the next play, forcing him to give up the ball to Jun Cortes, who missed an open three. But Ateneo could not control the rebound, and Dylan Ababou grabbed it, drawing a foul in the process. Ababou missed his first free throw, but made the second, giving UST the slimmest of margins, with time down to 12.5 seconds. The Eagles called their last timeout to set up their final offensive play.\nBarracoso inbounded to Intal, who called for an isolation at the top of the key against Ababou. He drove past Ababou, but missed a short bank shot. As Intal went up for his own miss, Cuan tied him up, forcing a jumpball, with the possession arrow pointing at UST. The Tigers then inbounded to Jun Cortes, who was fouled immediately. Cortes made the first free throw, giving UST a two-point lead, 76–74, with 3.7 seconds left. The second free throw rattled out, and the ball was tipped to Jai Reyes, who missed a desperation heave at the buzzer.\nMacky Escalona topscored for the Blue Eagles with 26 points, while Jojo Duncil led the Tigers' charge with 18.\nAftermath.\nThe celebrations at the campus began at the moment of UST's victory on October 2. The main celebrations were held on October 4, started by a thanksgiving holy mass at 5 pm, celebrated by incoming Fr. Ernesto Arceo, O.P., followed by parties, a dinner, and a 10-minute fireworks display seen over much of Sampaloc, Manila.\nThe night was capped off by a concert (7 pm) with the Thomasian pop band Callalily, Thomasian alumna and bossa nova singer Sofia, Soapdish, and to chill and wrap up the night, the Atenean band Parokya ni Edgar and UP band Kamikazee. Heavy rains in the end, however, dampened the smooth flow of the programme.\nThe winning team will reportedly head to the Great Wall of China as a reward for their championship, as promised by the acting rector\nAfter the championship celebrations, PLDT, whose president is Manny Pangilinan, a known Ateneo supporter, released a radio advertisement, where the ad depicts a play-by-play basketball sequence, with the commentator outlining a UST three-point play, and at the climax, the commentator retorts, \"Who cares?\" which then promotes a new PLDT product. After the promotion, the commentator comes back and says, \"Game over, who won?\"\nThe following year, the Tigers entered the playoff round by beating FEU in a rubber match. In the stepladder round, they lose to the Eagles who sought revenge on their defeat in the finals. They would lose key players like Cortez and Espiritu following next year.\nIn season 71, the Tigers with high expectations finished at 6–8 and not making to the Final Four for the first time in Pido Jarencio's tenure as coach. They also lose 6 key players from the championship team to graduation leaving Dylan Ababou as the sole member of the 2006 championship team next year.\nPost-season tournaments.\nAs semifinalists of the UAAP, the Tigers qualified for the Collegiate Champions League. With the seedings determined before their championship, they were seeded third, behind first seed Ateneo and second seed San Beda, the NCAA champion.\nThe Tigers' round of 16 assignment was against the JRU Heavy Bombers, which finished tied for sixth in NCAA Season 82. The Tigers practically led for much of the game when June Dizon and Mel Gile were ejected at the second quarter. The Tigers regained their composure but the Heavy Bombers cut the lead, culminating two freethrows by Heavy Bomber Mark Cagoco with 1:56 left at the second quarter, giving JRU the lead, 65–63. The teams never scored again as the UAAP champions were eliminated from the tournament.\nThe Tigers are participated in the 2006–07 Philippine Basketball League Silver Cup as the Kettle Corn Pop Kings. Kettle Corn is a popcorn snack sold by the RFM Corporation. The members of team also includes non-Thomasians. The Pop Kings finished last in the classification round, and was eliminated by Magnolia Ice Cream Spinners (with most players coming from NCAA champions San Beda Red Lions) 133–128 in triple overtime at the first round of the playoffs."

        "title": "Frank Clarke (American football)",
        "text": "Franklin Clarke (February 7, 1934 – July 25, 2018) was an American football wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Cleveland Browns and Dallas Cowboys. He played college football at the University of Colorado.\nEarly years.\nClarke was named after Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States. He attended Beloit Memorial High School where he received All-state honors in football and track. He clocked 49.9 seconds in the 440-yard dash.\nAfter attending Trinidad State Junior College for two years, where he had a successful career, he became the first African-American varsity football player at the University of Colorado at Boulder, joining the Buffaloes in September 1954. He had to sit out the season after transferring. He was joined by John Wooten the following year and because this was before the civil rights movement, the pair often had to endure open racism outside of Boulder.\nAs a junior, he was an honorable-mention All-Big 7 conference performer, when he was second in the league with 407 receiving yards, during a run-oriented era. He also returned kickoffs, while leading the team with 13 receptions and 5 receiving touchdowns.\nAs a senior, he led the team with 7 receptions for 124 yards and 2 receiving touchdowns. Trailing 13–0 against the University of Missouri and needing a tie or a win to clinch a berth for the 1957 Orange Bowl, Clarke scored 2 second half touchdowns. Clemson University originally stated that they would not play in the bowl against a team with black athletes, but later changed its position and would end up losing 27–21. He was selected to play in the Copper Bowl All-Star game.\nClarke amassed 20 receptions for 532 yards (26.6 yard average), 7 receiving touchdowns and 2 blocked kicks, ending his career fifth at the time in receiving yards at Colorado. He was so well liked among his peers on campus, that he was chosen as King of the annual Days festival, Colorado's equivalent of Homecoming King. He also practiced basketball and track.\nIn 2008, he was inducted into the Colorado Athletic Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nCleveland Browns.\nClarke was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round (61st overall) of the 1956 NFL Draft. He played with the team for three seasons, from 1957 to 1959, even though he stood on the sidelines during the first two. He had a total of 10 catches during those three years at offensive right end and was left unprotected in the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft.\nDallas Cowboys.\nClarke was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft. His coaches at Colorado and Cleveland criticized his blocking, but the Cowboys were still intrigued by the 6-1, 215-pound player. Instead of picking at his deficiencies, Tom Landry chose to accentuate his strengths. The coach appreciated his speed, soft hands and his ability to run precise routes, so he was converted into a split end. Mostly a backup behind Billy Howton and Fred Dugan, he appeared in 8 games (3 starts), registering 9 receptions, 290 yards, 3 touchdowns and a 32.2-yard average.\nHe moved into the starting role in 1961, tallying 41 receptions, 919 yards, 22.4-yard average (led the league), 9 touchdowns and scored 54 points (led the team). Additionally, he began a streak of seven consecutive games with at least a touchdown reception, which still stands as a Cowboys record shared with Bob Hayes (1965–1966), Terrell Owens (2007), and Dez Bryant (2012).\nHe turned out to be the Cowboys' first bona fide long-ball threat—before \"Bullet\" Bob Hayes joined him. Hayes even credits Clarke for teaching him the proper way to catch \"the bomb\"—the long pass. He is also credited as the first African American star athlete, on a Cowboys that played in a then racially divided Dallas.\nIn 1962, his opening day performance against the Washington Redskins was one for the ages. His 10 receptions for 241 yards, remains the best opening day performance in terms of most yards receiving, of any wide receiver in the history of the NFL. On September 23, Clarke was part of an infamous play where, for the first time in an NFL game, points were awarded for a penalty. The Cowboys were holding in the end zone on a 99-yard touchdown pass from Eddie LeBaron to Clarke, and the Pittsburgh Steelers were awarded a safety, helping them win the game 30–28. He was close to breaking the NFL season touchdown receiving record until missing the last 2 games with an injury.\nThat year would be his best, becoming the first player in team history to gain more than 1,000 yards in a season (ground or air) and recording 47 passes for career high numbers in yards (1043) and touchdowns (14). In addition to leading the NFL with 14 touchdowns and a 22.2-yard average per reception.\nIn 1964, he caught 65 passes (franchise record) for 973 yards, 5 touchdowns and received All-Pro honors.\nIn 1965, he was moved to tight end and was second on the team with 41 receptions for 682 yards and 4 touchdowns. In 1965, he was a backup to Pettis Norman, but remained productive and became a clutch third down receiver, recording 26 receptions for 355 and 4 touchdowns. The next year, his production fell to 9 receptions for 119 yards. He announced his retirement on July 17, 1968.\nClarke led the Cowboys in yards and touchdowns from 1961 to 1964, and catches in 1963 and 1964. He held the franchise record for most touchdowns in a season by a receiver with 14 from his 1962 season, which stood for 45 years until 2007, when it was broken by Terrell Owens. He also had the team record for the most career receiving multi-touchdown games with 9, until it was broken by Dez Bryant in 2014.\nHe retired after the 1967 NFL Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers, in what is now known as the “Ice Bowl”, won by the Packers, 21–17. He left with most of the franchise's records for receiving, finishing with 281 receptions for 5,214 yards and 51 touchdowns in 140 NFL games, which ranks sixth in receiving yards in Dallas Cowboys history.\nBroadcasting.\nClarke began his career as a sportscaster for WFAA-TV (Channel 8). He became the first African American sports anchor in a Dallas television station and at CBS. On weekends, he anchored sports reports for WFAA-TV when not working NFL games for CBS.\nPersonal life.\nClarke died on July 25, 2018, at the age of 84. \nHe was Catholic, raised in the faith and passing it down to his children.\nHis nephew is former sheriff David Clarke of Milwaukee."

For the first time video evidence (of the game) was accepted in a French Court.

        "text": "Ray Williston Collins (February 11, 1887 – January 9, 1970) was a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the Boston Red Sox. A native of Colchester, Vermont, Collins batted and threw left-handed. He debuted on July 19, 1909, and played his final game on October 7, 1915. He was a member of the 1912 Red Sox championship team, and also the 1915 Red Sox but did not play in that year's World Series.\nPlaying career.\nA graduate of the University of Vermont, Collins was a good-hitting pitcher and an outstanding fielder, but the key to his success was his remarkable control. He consistently ranked among the American League leaders in fewest walks allowed per nine innings, finishing third in the league in 1912 (1.90), second in 1913 (1.35) and fourth in 1914 (1.85). He also averaged 16 wins from 1910 to 1914, including a combined 39 wins in 1913 and 1914. In a seven-season career, Collins posted an 84–62 record with 511 strikeouts and a 2.51 ERA in 1336 innings, including 19 shutouts and 90 complete games.\nCollins became a regular in Boston rotation in 1910. In his first full season, he pitched a one-hitter against the Chicago White Sox and compiled a 13–11 record, making him the second-winningest pitcher on the Red Sox behind Eddie Cicotte (15–11). He was 3–6 at one point in 1911, but turned his season around, finishing at 11–12 with a 2.40 ERA.\nCollins missed the first two months of the 1912 season with a knee injury, during which time the Red Sox christened their new stadium, Fenway Park. He did not start a game until early June, but won two games in three days over the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park, 7–3 on July 3 and 5–3 on July 5. Collins finished fifth in the AL with four shutouts, by all of them came in the second half of the season. He compiled a 13–8 mark and his ERA stood at 2.53, fifth-best in the league. The only left-hander in Boston rotation, Collins was considered the second-best on the pitching staff behind Smoky Joe Wood (34–5) as the Red Sox clinched the American League pennant. Collins started Game Two of the World Series against Christy Mathewson and the New York Giants. He led 4–2 after seven innings and was pulled in the eight with only one out after the Giants rallied for three runs. The game was called on account of darkness after 11 innings with the score tied 6–6. Collins was supposed to start again in Game Six, but Red Sox manager Jake Stahl opted by Buck O'Brien, coming off a 20–13 season. The Giants shelled him for five runs in the first inning. Then, Collins relieved in the second and pitched shutout ball for seven innings in a 5–2 lost cause.\nCollins enjoyed his best season yet in 1913, finishing at 19–8, as his .714 winning percentage was the second-highest in the league. In the midseason, he pitched a four-hit, 9–0 shutout and hit a home run St. Louis Browns on July 9. Later, on July 26, he pitched a five-hitter and hit a bases-loaded triple to give Boston a 4–1 victory over the Chicago White Sox. Collins also faced great Walter Johnson and the Washington Senators three times that season. Each game finished 1–0, with Collins winning two of them, including scoreless ball for 11 innings on August 29.\nCollins became the ace of Boston pitching staff in 1914 with a 20–13 record and a 2.51 ERA. His six shutouts ranked him fourth in the American League that season, and he was one of only three pitchers in the league to reach the 20-win plateau, joining Walter Johnson (28) and Stan Coveleski (22). Collins picked up his 19th and 20th victories on September 22, by pitching complete games in both ends of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers at Navin Field, winning by scores of 5–3 in the opener and 5–0 in the nightcap.\nIn 1915, the Red Sox were in the enviable position of having too many good (and younger) pitchers: Rube Foster, Ernie Shore, Dutch Leonard, and Babe Ruth made up the best rotation in major league baseball. Then Collins was relegated to the bullpen. Starting only nine games, the fewest since his rookie year, Collins finished with a 4–7 record and a 4.30 ERA in 25 pitching appearances. He did not pitch a single inning in the 1915 World Series as Boston defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in five games. After the season the Red Sox expected him to take a cut in his $5400 salary, but Collins, at age 29, announced his retirement from professional baseball stating simply that he was \"discouraged by his failure to show old-time form.\"\nLater years.\nAfter his playing career, Collins returned to the University of Vermont where he served as baseball coach from 1923 to 1928. During and after his baseball career, he was a dairy farmer in Colchester, Vermont, operating the family farm until 1960, and was co-founder of the Burlington Milk Cooperative Creamery (later part of HP Hood). Collins headed the Colchester draft board during World War II and represented Colchester in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1943 to 1946, serving on the agriculture and traffic committees. During the 1950s, he served on UVM's board of trustees, presiding over the school's transition from private to public university. Collins had five children with wife Lillian, the last surviving of whom (Ray Jr.) died on September 14, 2013, aged 99.\nCollins died in Burlington, Vermont, at age 82.\nIn 2012, Collins was part of the inaugural class of the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

Michael joined the Red Devils following 3 appearances with the North Wales Crusaders in 2014. Platt's 1st choice position is Full Back but he has been more effective at Centre for the Bradford Bulls winning the 'Rugby League World Centre of the Month' for August.\nBackground.\nPlatt was born in Manchester, England.\nEarly career.\nPlatt started his career at the Salford City Reds, making his début in the Super League against the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats in the final game of the 2001 season at just 17. However he never quite made the grade and was released by the club.\nMichael then signed for the Rochdale Hornets. His impressive début season was somewhat blighted by a broken jaw, although he did go on to win the National League's Young Player of the Year award in 2004.\nCastleford Tigers.\nMichael then joined the Castleford Tigers (Heritage № 820), and helped the Tigers gain promotion in 2005. Despite the subsequent Super League season proving to be difficult in a squad which lacked quality, Platt still managed to score 7 tries. However, after a heart-breaking 29–17 defeat against Wakefield in the final game of the season, Castleford were relegated.\nBradford Bulls.\nPlatt joined the Bradford Bulls in 2007 after a dispute between Platt and Castleford over his availability. His first season started well and he topped the try-scorers league for a number of weeks at the start of the season. He extended his contract in 2011 for a further 2 years, meaning he will stay with the Bulls until at least 2013.\nReturn to hometown club.\nOn 18 April 2014, Salford head coach, and former Bradford Bulls team-mate, Iestyn Harris signed up Michael to play for the Red Devils for the remainder of the 2014 season.\nInternational.\nPlatt is an Irish international. He was overlooked by Tony Smith for Great Britain and this has been seen to be due to his allegiance to Ireland for the World Cup 2008 in Australia, and the continuing outstanding form of Paul Wellens. However he was called up for the Great Britain Squad for the 2007 test series with New Zealand, and played at full back for the prestigious Northern Union game against All Golds in a centenary match.\nHe was named in the Ireland training squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and the Ireland squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.\nIn October 2014, Platt played in the European Cup competition."

Hall is best known as a member of the Baltimore Orioles dynasty that won four American League pennants and two World Series championships between 1966 and 1971. He also played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Kansas City Athletics and Philadelphia Phillies. The , Hall batted and threw right-handed. He earned the nickname \"Turkey\" due to his unusual pitching motion.\nProfessional career.\nOutfielder.\nHall started his MLB career in 1952 with the Pittsburgh Pirates as an outfielder. After short trials during that season and in 1953, he spent all of 1954 on the Pittsburgh roster, and started 84 of the club's 154 games: 32 in left field, 43 in center, and nine in right. However, he batted only .239 with 74 hits, two home runs and 27 runs batted in. \nPitcher.\nThe following year, 1955, he began his transition to the pitcher's mound, going 12–5 with 16 complete games and a sparkling 2.24 earned run average for the Lincoln Chiefs of the Western League. Recalled by Pittsburgh in midseason, he won the first MLB game he ever pitched, a 12–5 triumph over the Chicago Cubs at Forbes Field on July 24, but later started two games in center field, on July 29–30 against the Cincinnati Redlegs at Crosley Field. Hall would pitch in 15 games, with 13 starts, and compile a creditable 6–6 (3.91) record for a team that finished last in the National League and dropped 94 games overall. Then, in 1956, he appeared in 33 games for the Pirates, 19 on the mound and 14 as a pinch hitter or first baseman. He lost all seven pitching decisions, but hit .500 (six for 12) in the pinch and .345 overall. \nHe became exclusively a pitcher in 1957 but, battling a sore arm, he spent most of the season with Triple-A Columbus, then all of 1958 on the sidelines. He returned to action in 1959, and at age 28 had a breakthrough season in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League with the Salt Lake City Bees, winning 18 games and earning a September recall to Pittsburgh. \nOn December 9, 1959, during the interleague trading period just put into effect, the Pirates traded Hall, Ken Hamlin and Hank Foiles to the Kansas City Athletics for catcher/utilityman Hal Smith. In Hall's first season in the American League, working for another cellar-dwelling team, he started 28 games and went 8–13, but his 182 innings pitched and nine complete games were third among A's pitchers; his 4.05 earned run average outperformed the staff ERA by 0.33.\nAs the 1961 season was about to begin, Hall was acquired by the Orioles along with Dick Williams for Chuck Essegian and Jerry Walker on April 12. He transitioned from a starting pitcher into a spot starter and relief pitcher who was paired with relief aces Hoyt Wilhelm and then Stu Miller. Hall's best season came in 1964, when he pitched 87 innings with a WHIP of 0.844 and an ERA of 1.85.\nHall helped the Orioles win the 1966 and 1970 World Series and 1969 and 1971 American League pennant. His Baltimore tenure was interrupted by two years (1967–1968) back in the National League as a key member of the Philadelphia Phillies' bullpen. After a stellar 1967 season (ten wins, nine saves, and a 2.20 ERA), he slumped in 1968, and when the Phillies released him on October 29, the Orioles signed him as a free agent in 1969 after a spring training trial. Hall rebounded to win 21 games and save ten others for three consecutive pennant-winning Oriole teams through 1971. Hall pitched in five postseason games without allowing an earned run. Hall was the first pitcher to record a win in League Championship Series play, on October 4, 1969. In 1970 and 1971, he was the oldest player in the American League.\nCareer statistics.\nIn 495 MLB games pitched over 16 years, Hall compiled a 93–75 win–loss record, 74 games started, 20 complete games, three shutouts, 237 games finished, 68 saves, 1,259 innings pitched, 1,152 hits allowed, 512 runs allowed, 464 earned runs allowed, 130 home runs allowed, 236 walks allowed, 741 strikeouts, 18 hit batsmen, one wild pitch, 5,085 batters faced, 70 intentional walks and a 3.32 ERA. In his postseason career, Hall tossed 8 innings over five games; he did not give up an earned run and only three hits, registering two wins and two saves. He ranks 22nd on the MLB Career WHIP List (1.102), 39th on the MLB Career Walks per Nine Innings Pitched List (1.69) and 47th on the MLB Career Strikeout to Walk List (3.14). Jim Palmer, who learned about pitching from Hall, called him, \"One of the great control pitchers ever.\"\nAs a hitter, in 669 games Hall had 714 at bats, 79 runs, 150 hits, 15 doubles, four triples, four home runs, 56 RBI, six stolen bases, 61 walks, .210 batting average, .271 on-base percentage, .259 slugging percentage, 185 total bases, 34 sacrifice hits and nine sacrifice flies. He struck out 147 times and collected 61 walks. He was an occasional pinch hitter through 1966 and batted .257 in 35 at bats in that role.\nLegacy and career accomplishments.\nHall won the Most Valuable Player award in the Pacific Coast League in 1959, after posting a sterling 18–5 record and leading the PCL in wins, earned run average (1.87), and winning percentage (.783). He would be inducted as a member of the Baltimore Oriole Hall of Fame in 1989.\nPersonal life.\nA native of St. Louis, Hall spent most of his childhood in Albany, New York, and Haworth, New Jersey. He was educated at what is now Northfield Mount Hermon School, a college-preparatory school in Massachusetts, and graduated from Swarthmore College. He was the older brother of linguist Barbara Partee, also a Swarthmore graduate. Hall also played football and basketball and ran track at Swarthmore.\nHall died on June 18, 2023, in Timonium, Maryland, at the age of 92."

        "title": "American football card",
        "text": "An American football card is a type of collectible trading card typically printed on paper stock or card stock that features one or more American football players or other related sports figures. These cards are most often found in the United States and other countries where the sport is popular.\nMost football cards features National Football League (NFL) players, but can also feature college football players. Player cards normally list the player's statistics and a narration about their play. Some special edition packs of cards include authentic autographs or jersey cards. Some may include bubble gum or a special edition player card. Many cards are serial-numbered, meaning that there are only so many of that particular card produced. These include unique prints (numbered 1/1). Included in these are printing plates, used in the actual production of the card.\nHistory.\nThe first American football cards were included in cigarette packages in the late 1800s. In 1888 Yale player Henry W. Beecher was included as the only football player in a set of 50 cards distributed in packs of \"Old Judge\" and \"Gypsy Queen\" cigarettes by Goodwin &amp; Company., becoming the first American football card ever.\nThe first entire set of cards to focus on American football players was printed by the Mayo Cut Plug Tobacco Company, which released a 35-card set in 1894, featuring players from the schools that became the Ivy League.\nIn the early 1900s, trading cards were printed in mixed sport sets, and the football players were generally from college football. They were used to promote other items in addition to tobacco products such as Spalding's sporting goods, breakfast cereal, ice cream, doughnuts and gum.\nThe National Chicle Company released its own football set, with only 36 cards, in 1935. It was the first set to feature players from the National Football League, including six Hall of Fame players.\nAlong with baseball cards, American football cards began gaining popularity after World War II. In 1948, there were two sports card producers, Bowman and Leaf Candy Company. Both produced their first football card sets, each consisting of about 100 cards of then-current players from the National Football League, with the Leaf set including a number of prominent college players. Leaf's set had also the distinction of being the first post-war cards in color.\nLeaf only went on to produce one more set, a skip-numbered set in 1949. However, Bowman continued producing sets, from 1950 through 1955. In addition, Topps Chewing Gum Company produced its first set in 1950. Bowman would be bought out by Topps in 1956. That year, Topps produced a new card set (after producing sets of historic college players in 1950, 1951, and 1955).\nFleer entered to the market in 1960, producing football cards of American Football League, then switching to NFL until Philadelphia Gum secured the rights for football cards in 1964.\nIn 1962, a cereal manufacturer, Post Cereal, released its first football cards set, which could be ordered directly from the company or available from cereal boxes. Another cereal company, Kellogg's, released its first set in 1970. Kellogg's would launch sets regularly until 1983. A new brand, Score, entered into market in 1989 with its collection of football cards. Two years later, Upper Deck obtained licenses from the NFL to produce trading cards. Upper Deck established itself so quickly that it rivaled Topps. Upper Deck produced cards under license of the NFL until 2010. In 1992, SkyBox International (a company founded only three years prior) produced its first set of football cards. Collector's Edge was another company that produced football cards in the 1990s.\nDonruss, a company that had been in the non-sports trading cards market since 1961 manufacturing products related with movies or TV shows, released its football set in 1995, remaining in the business until March 2009 when Italian Panini Group purchased assets of the industry's second-oldest trading card company, Donruss, and formed the new subsidiary, \"Panini America\".\nIn 2015, Panini signed a long-term contract with the NFL that secured the company exclusive trading card and sticker rights of the league. But the NFLPA terminated the licensing agreement with Panini in 2023. This is because they signed on with Fanatics, who now owns the rights to produce football cards.\nBeginning in the fall of 2022, Topps releases non-exclusive trading cards for U.S. college football and basketball featuring current athletes from approximately 100 colleges. Athletes will not be restricted from signing with other trading card companies. Both schools and athletes benefit from the royalties and royalties paid from the sale of collegiate cards.\nReception.\nIn 2007, one of the earliest known football cards featuring John Dunlop from Harvard, was sold for $10,000, the highest price paid for a football card up to that time.\nIn their humor book \"Football Uncyclopedia\", Michael Kun and Adam Hoff compare football card collectors to baseball card collectors claiming among other things that \"Baseball fans keep their old baseball cards in firm plastic sleeves...[and] include their baseball-card collections in their wills\" while \"Football fans could not give two craps about collecting football cards\" which they present as \"Exhibit A for why football fans are smarter than baseball fans.\"\nIn January 2014, football cards from the collection of Jefferson R. Burdick, including ones dating to 1894, were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\n\"In March 2016, veteran sports card dealer Brian Cataquet discovered 1970 Football cards produced by Topps with players wrong names printed on the back of the cards. These cards pictured the correct players photo and name on the front of the card, but on the back of the cards had a different players name printed by error. \"There were five in the collection Cataquet acquired:\nTommy Nobis front/ Chuck Walton printed on reverse\nBill Brown front/ Steve Delong on reverse\nRich Jackson front/Bart Starr reverse\nRoland Lakes front/ Dave Robinson reverse\nLen St. Jean front/ Dave Rowe reverse\"\nManufacturing companies.\nPast.\nMost of the past producers companies are defunct or have left the trading card business, they are:"

        "title": "United Regional Basketball League",
        "text": "The United Regional Basketball League (URBL) was a community-based amateur basketball league in the Philippines that played only one season in 2004. The league was managed by persons identified with the old Metropolitan Basketball Association (MBA), a professional community-based league that suspended operations in the middle of 2002. Basketball legend and former MBA commissioner Ramon Fernandez reprised his role with the URBL.\nHistory.\nSometime in February 2004, the Ilocos Sur Snipers of Gov. Luis “Chavit” Singson and M. Lhuillier Kwarta Padala-Cebu City of Michel Lhuillier ceded from the National Basketball League (NBL), which had just been renamed the National Basketball Conference (NBC). The two teams were not satisfied with the way the NBL/NBC was being managed and so opted to form their own league.\nThree other teams later joined the fray – the Quezon Coco Huskers, Lactovitale-Cebu and Harbour Centre-Pampanga of Mikee Romero.\nThe opening ceremonies were held on September 25, 2004 at the New Cebu Coliseum. Forward Melchor Latoreno of the Huskers scored the first basket in league history in the opening game against Lactovitale. Lactovitale prevailed, 82-77, behind the 21 markers of Bonel Balingit.\nTournament format called for the five teams to play two round robins, with the top four advancing to the double round semifinals and their elimination round records set aside. The top two teams after the semifinals clashed in a best-of-five series for the title while the other two teams will dispute Third Place in a one-game playoff.\nM. Lhuillier topped the eliminations with a 7-1 record. The Snipers and Harbour Centre-Pampanga followed at 4-4. The Huskers (3-5) took the final semifinal slot by edging by a game Lactovitale (2-6).\nIn the semifinals, the Snipers made their move and finished in a tie with M. Lhuillier at the top, 4-2. However, the Snipers earned the home court advantage in the championship series. The Huskers finished at 3-3, bungling a chance to force a triple-tie thanks to a loss to Harbour Centre on the final day of the semis. That was Harbour Centre's lone semifinal win.\nM. Lhuillier defeated the Snipers to win the championship, 3-1. Both squads split the opening two games in Santo Domingo, Ilocos Sur. M. Lhuillier bounced back to take the next two meetings in Cebu City. Meanwhile, Huskers exacted revenge on Harbour Centre in the City of San Fernando to take Third Place, 88-84.\nDespite a successful inaugural run, the URBL folded up after one season. The biggest blow came off the basketball court after Commissioner Fernandez suddenly became scarce in order to attend to some family matters. Sans their leader, the preparations for the second season hit a major roadblock.\nStill, the group helped organize the 2005 Mayor Tomas Osmena Sinulog International Invitational Cup in Cebu City in January. M. Lhuillier won the tournament via a sweep. The Huskers, which was reinforced by stars from the other URBL teams, finished in second ahead of guest entries from Konkuk University of South Korea, Fujian Province of China, North Cotabato and the Philippine Training Team. As their final activity, the URBL tied up with the San Jose Sky Rockets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and facilitated the team's search for possible Filipino recruits in October. That led to the Sky Rockets’ signing of guard Mark Magsumbol, a former national junior cager.\nAftermath.\nIn the aftermath of the URBL's closure, Harbour Centre accepted an offer to put up a new team in the Philippine Basketball League (PBL). M. Lhuillier coach Raul “Yayoy” Alcoseba then organized a similar community-based league exclusive for Southern Philippines, the Mindanao Visayas Basketball Association (MVBA). Soberano later signed up as one of the MVBA pioneers through his Cebu Landmaster quintet. The Quezon Coco Huskers would be resurrected in 2023 as the Quezon Huskers as an expansion team for the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League's (MPBL) 2023 season.\nChampionship series.\nM. Lhuillier Kwarta Padala-Cebu City d. Ilocos Sur Snipers, 3-1\nNotable players.\nMost Valuable Player\nMythical Five\nWith the URBL's closure in 2005, many of its alumni managed to further their basketball careers in the PBL and MVBA. The URBL takes pride that its alumni have gone on to earn roster slots in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), led by Dacia who was signed up by the Air21 Express as a rookie free agent. The other PBA call-ups were guard Nino Marquez (Air21) and center Mark Kong (Alaska) of the Huskers and the Snipers’ center Philip Butel (Sta. Lucia). Snipers’ center Ryan Bernardo did not finish the URBL season as he hooked up with Red Bull, his second PBA team after a stint with FedEx from 2002 to 2003. Edgar Echavez of the Huskers, who played for Purefoods in 2003, also managed to return to the PBA via Barangay Ginebra in 2005.\nMedia coverage.\nThe URBL's opening ceremonies and doubleheader were covered live over ABC-5 (now TV5) is a produced by ABC Sports. Television coverage then took a break and returned during the championship series although on a delayed basis on NBN-4.\nAside from television, the URBL enjoyed good print coverage from both local and national newspapers, tabloids and magazines. Some of Lactovitale's home games saw some time over local radio stations."

        "text": "The Mexican Open (currently sponsored by Telcel and HSBC and called the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC) is a professional tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts, and usually held annually in late February and early March at the Arena GNP Seguros since 2022 and previously at the Fairmont Acapulco Princess, both in Acapulco, Mexico. It was played on outdoor red clay courts until 2013. The change to hard courts was introduced in 2014. The Mexican Open is part of the ATP Tour 500 series on the ATP Tour, and until 2020 was one of the WTA International tournaments on the WTA Tour.\nThe tournament was introduced on the ATP Tour in 1993, and began on the WTA Tour in 2001. It was held in Mexico City from 1993 to 1998, and once more in 2000, before being relocated to Acapulco in 2001. It was the closing leg of the four-ATP tournament Golden Swing. Starting in 2014, the Mexican Open's surface changed from clay to hard courts, serving as a lead-up to the first ATP Tour Masters 1000 event of the season in Indian Wells, United States. The winner traditionally receives a giant silver gourd trophy.\nHistory.\nIn the men's singles, Rafael Nadal (2005, 2013, 2020, 2022), David Ferrer (2010–2012, 2015) and Thomas Muster (1993–1996) hold the record for most overall titles (four each), with Muster holding the record for most consecutive wins (four).

In the men's doubles, Donald Johnson (1996, 2000–01) has won the most titles (three), and co-holds with Michal Mertiňák (2008–09) and David Marrero (2012–13) the record for most back-to-back titles (two). In the women's doubles, María José Martínez Sánchez (2001, 2008–09) is the one holding the most titles (three) and shares with Nuria Llagostera Vives (2008–09) the record for most consecutive wins (two).\nATP points and prize money.\nFor the 2024 edition the distribution of points and prize money was as follows:\nSingles\nWTA points and prize money.\nFor the 2020 edition the distribution of points and prize money was as follows:\nSingles"

        "text": "The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the FIFA, the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place organised every four years, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to World War II. A hat-trick occurs when a player scores three or more goals in a single match and it is considered an achievement, especially while playing at the largest international football tournament in the world. Across the over 800 matches at the 22 tournaments of the FIFA World Cup, 54 hat-tricks have been scored. The first hat-trick was scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States, playing against Paraguay in 1930; the most recent was by Kylian Mbappé of France, playing against Argentina on 18 December 2022. The only World Cup not to have at least one hat-trick scored was the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. The record number of hat-tricks in a single World Cup tournament is eight, during the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland.\nOnly four players have scored more than one hat-trick at the FIFA World Cup: Sándor Kocsis (two in 1954), Just Fontaine (two in 1958), Gerd Müller (two in 1970) and Gabriel Batistuta (1994 and 1998) — the latter being the only player in history to score hat-tricks at two World Cups. 19 players have scored a hat-trick in the knockout stage of the FIFA World Cup. Two were playing in their first ever World Cup match, Edmund Conen and Angelo Schiavio, both in 1934, a tournament without a group stage. Geoff Hurst (1966) and Kylian Mbappé (2022), who also scored 2 penalties, are the only players to have scored a hat-trick in the final. Two players have scored a hat-trick in the second group stage of the World Cup, Paolo Rossi and Zbigniew Boniek, both in 1982."

        "text": " \nNational team appearances in the FIBA Basketball World Cup are the number of appearances that individual country's basketball national teams have made at the FIBA Basketball World Cup. A total of 65 countries have made at least one appearance in the FIBA international senior men's basketball competition.\nAfrican, European and teams from the Americas composed the first World Championship – Asian and Oceanian teams did not want to make a long trip to Argentina, the venue of the tournament. Egypt finished fifth in the inaugural world championship, the best finish by a team from Africa. An Asian team, the Philippines, made their debut on the second tournament, where they finished third, the best finish by an Asian team.\nAustralia was the first team from Oceania to participate in the tournament, in 1970. New Zealand was defeated in the 2002 bronze medal game, earning them a fourth-place finish, a position the Australian team equaled in 2019.\nEuropean and teams from the Americas dominated the tournament, with teams from either confederation disputing the gold medal. Since 1978, the first time a final was played, there have been five all-European and six Europe-Americas finals. The worst finish by a European team since 1963 was second; for a team from the Americas, the worst all-time was third.\nThe tournament formats prior to the 1978 tournament were two round robin phases – teams were first divided into several groups, with the top teams from the group stage qualifying for the Final Group, where they play each other once. The team with the best record after the Final Group wins the gold medal, with ties broken by games played between tied teams. All tournaments after the 1978 tournament determined the world champion via a playoff – in 1978 and 1982, the top two teams from the final group squared off for the championship; since 1986, a single-elimination tournament has been used.\nThe national team with the most wins is the USA, with five. Although teams bearing the name of \"Yugoslavia\" have won five titles, FIBA used to consider the championships to have been won by two national teams. The first three were won by the team that represented the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The other two were won by a team representing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which FIBA treats as the predecessor of the current Serbia national team. Furthermore, a Yugoslav team was able to finish at least third from 1963 to 2002. \nGermany is the current World Champion, winning the gold medal game against Serbia at the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nDebut of teams.\nA total of 65 national teams have appeared in at least one FIBA Basketball World Cup in the history of the tournament through the 2023 competition. Each successive Basketball World Cup has had at least one team appearing for the first time. Countries competing in their first Basketball World Cup are listed below by year.\nTournament format.\nIn deciphering the tables below, the tournament format per championship has to be accounted for.\nTeam results.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Legend:\nNotes:\nPerformance of host nations.\nWith only three wins in 16 occasions, the success rate of host nations winning the tournament is rather low at 19%, compared to the respective percentage in the FIFA World Cup which stands at 32% (6 out of 19). Yugoslavia was the last host to win, in 1970; the only other host to medal since then has been Turkey, silver medalist in 2010. Greece has been the only other host nation to finish fourth or better since 1970. From 1959 to 1982, the host qualified directly to the final round of the tournament, bypassing the preliminary round (group stage). The host's final rank in these years could not be worse than the number of teams in the final round (between six and eight). However, beginning in 1986, the host has competed in the preliminary round.\nA \"†\" denotes that is the best performance of the team, a \"‡\" denotes it is the best performance of the team at the time of the competition.\nPerformance by confederation.\nThis is a summary of the best performances of each confederation in each tournament. Note that most confederations did not exist until up to the 1960s, and that FIBA assigned teams to a specific continent when there were no confederations yet.\nNumber of teams by confederation.\nThis is a summary of the total number of participating teams by confederation in each tournament. The number of teams in the confederation of a host federation is boldfaced."

        "text": "Charles Martin (August 31, 1959 – January 23, 2005) was an American football defensive end who played in the National Football League (NFL) for five seasons, primarily with the Green Bay Packers. He began his professional career on the Birmingham Stallions of the United States Football League (USFL) in 1983 and also played in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the Edmonton Eskimos before joining the Packers. Following his Green Bay tenure from 1984 to 1987, he was a member of the Houston Oilers and Atlanta Falcons until his 1988 retirement.\nDue to a late hit on Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon in 1986, Martin became the first modern NFL player to have a multi-game suspension for an on-field incident. The incident also made Martin the first NFL player ejected for a violent act not part of the game, setting an NFL precedent.\nEarly career.\nMartin attended Cherokee High School in Canton, Georgia and was nicknamed \"Too Mean\" for his tendency to pile on ball carriers after the whistle. He originally dropped out of school at age 14 but then rejoined to play football. He initially signed to play college football at Western Carolina, but followed assistant coach Joe D'Alessandris to Livingston University. At Livingston, he was a Division II All-American, twice received All-Gulf South Conference, and was the Defensive Player of the Year in 1982.\nProfessional career.\nBirmingham Stallions.\nMartin began his pro football career with the Birmingham Stallions of the USFL in 1983, but was cut after his first season.\nEdmonton Eskimos.\nMartin was signed by the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League in early 1984, but was cut before he could make it through a season.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nMartin immediately jumped into a starting role once he was signed by the Green Bay Packers. He signed with the Packers after he was not selected in the Supplemental Draft. \n1986 McMahon incident.\nOn November 23, 1986, in week 12 of the 1986 NFL season, the 10–2 Chicago Bears met the 2–10 Packers in a regular season game. During pre-game warm-ups, Martin displayed a white hand-towel with a list of five Bears offensive players' numbers: 9 for Jim McMahon, 34 for Walter Payton, 83 for Willie Gault, 63 for Jay Hilgenberg and 29 for Dennis Gentry. Martin wore the towel during the game, and allegedly claimed that it was a hit-list. On a third down play, Bears quarterback McMahon threw an interception down the field to Mark Lee. After the interception, Martin grabbed McMahon from behind and body-slammed him shoulder first to the ground. McMahon landed full force on his previously injured shoulder, a situation exacerbated by Soldier Field's artificial turf surface of the time. Referee Jerry Markbreit considered himself lucky to have seen Martin's hit at all, given his attention was supposed to have been directed downfield at the site of the interception. After Martin's action, Bears offensive lineman Jim Covert retaliated against Martin with a late hit of his own, and two offsetting flags were thrown. Markbreit explained what happened next,\nMarkbreit walked to the Packers sideline and told coach, Forrest Gregg \"This man is ejected from the game.\" Bears coach Mike Ditka ran out onto the field demanding an explanation for two flags having been thrown. The officials decided to pick up the flag for Covert's late hit and penalize only Martin and the Packers, given the egregiousness of the hit. Markbreit said, in a 2012 interview, \"it was the most violent act of its day.\"\nMartin was ejected from the game and further suspended for two games. The ejection set a precedent that any violent act that is not considered part of the game is grounds for ejection from a game. McMahon, who was already playing with a rotator cuff tear, suffered further damage requiring surgery, and which kept him out of competition for the rest of the 1986 season. After the game, the Packers defensive coordinator initially defended Martin, saying \"We tell people that if we intercept a pass, go get anybody near you.\" This was the first multi-game suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history.\nMartin played for the Packers from 1984–1987. He was cut early in the 1987 season after being implicated in a Green Bay bar fight.\nHouston Oilers.\nMartin played for the Oilers in the latter part of the 1987 season. In a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Martin speared Steelers running back Earnest Jackson, sparking a rivalry between Oilers coach Jerry Glanville and Steelers coach Chuck Noll.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nHe closed out his career with the Falcons in 1988, the only season in which he did not start a game.\nPersonal life.\nMartin was suspended two games in 1986 due to an incident at a bar. He later went into alcohol abuse treatment, and was twice divorced. He was arrested for disorderly conduct in 1987 for throwing an egg at the car of an NFL replacement player. \nMartin died in 2005 at age 45 in Houston due to complications from kidney failure."

        "title": "Derby Baseball Club",
        "text": "Derby Baseball Club is a defunct professional baseball club from Derby England, formed as Ley's Recreation Club by Francis Ley in 1890 and dissolved in the same year. A new Derby Baseball Club was formed (with Ley as chairman) in 1890 to succeed his dissolved club, this new Derby Baseball Club played until 1900, winning numerous National League titles in the 1890s, albeit as amateurs.\nHistory.\nBaseball was introduced to Derby by Francis Ley, an industrialist who owned Ley's Malleable Castings. Following a visit to the United States of America in 1889, Ley decided that, as a way of ensuring a healthier and more productive workforce, an investment should be made in promoting recreation for his workers.\nBallpark.\nDuring his journey to the States, Ley had seen the way in which baseball fields had been laid out by companies and factories for the use by their workers and decided to follow suit on his return to Derby. Consequently, Ley had the Ley's Recreation Centre (later renamed Baseball Ground) built; a park for the use of workers with cricket and baseball facilities. The Baseball Ground eventually became the home stadium of football club Derby County.\nUniform.\nIt was stated that for their first ever game Derby's uniforms were very similar to those worn by Blackburn Rovers and were supplied by Thompson and Sons of Babbington Lane. For the 1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain season Derby played in grey uniforms, with blue lettering to the front.\nFirst ever game.\nIn March 1890 local press featured advertisements appealing for \"professionals aged 20 to 25\" and \"cricketers who can field smartly\" to attend Ley's Recreation Centre to help form a new club.\nIn May 1890 Ley's Recreation Club hosted Erdington in “the first baseball match ever played in Derby”. Due to the expert coaching of Americans Bryan, Bullas and Reidenbach Ley's team stormed to a 23–0 lead after just two innings, at which point the Americans competed the rest of the game on the side of Erdington. The game closed out with a 23–11 win for Ley's Recreation Club. The Ley's roster for the game was:\nIn the following days the local press had dropped the Ley's Recreation Club name in favour of ‘The Derby Baseball Club’.\nNational League of Baseball of Great Britain.\nLey was not in attendance, in October 1889, when supporters of a proposed National League of Baseball of Great Britain met at the Criterion, London, to formally establish the new baseball association, though he was elected as a provisional officer. Representatives of Preston North End, Gloucester County Cricket Club, Essex County Cricket Club, Staffordshire County Cricket Club, Aston Villa and the National Rounders Association all were represented and elected as officers to the association, with Newton Crane elected to the chair. In March 1890 William Sudell agreed to form a professional baseball club at Preston North End and Francis Ley agreed to form a professional baseball club for Derby. It was proposed that a twelve club National League will be formed, with teams to be based at Wolverhampton, Liverpool, Accrington, Manchester, Bolton, Stoke-on-Trent and Birmingham.\nIn June the first annual meeting of the National League of Baseball of Great Britain was held at the Queens Hotel, Birmingham, with the constitution being drawn up. Thomas Slaney (president) and Harry Lockett (administrator) of the Stoke Baseball Club), Francis Ley (president of Derby Baseball Club), William McGregor (President of the Aston Villa Baseball Club) and James Allard on behalf of the absent William Sudell (president of the Preston North End Baseball Club) were all in attendance, Morton Betts was in the chair. A National League schedule was confirmed for the four clubs, Francis Ley agreed to supply the pennants and badges for the winning club.\nOn 4 August Secretary Alexander Langland of Derby officially ‘retires’ the club from the National League, with immediate effect, citing financial losses and low attendances. On 5 August Ley wrote to the Derby Daily Telegraph to propose that the ‘retired’ Derby take on other local baseball clubs for a local challenge cup, donating £52 10s. towards a cup for the winning club. On 8 August the Derbyshire Advertiser and Journal stated that “owing to the decision of the National League requiring the Derby club to not pitch Reidenbach, the American pitcher, in remaining championship matches, the Derby club have withdrawn from the league.” Ley threatened that he intended to cease the activities of the club altogether, and had refused A. G. Spalding’s request for Derby to finish their National League fixtures. It was stated that Reidenbach and Bullas, American professionals at Derby, are the only Americans in the employ of Ley, in order to allow them to play for Derby.\nOn 8 August Morton Betts, Secretary of the National League of Baseball of Great Britain issued a statement, in response to “incorrect statements” given to regional press by Ley, on events leading up to Derby ‘retiring‘ from the National League. It was stated that on the 9 July Ley agreed to only use his professional American pitchers in games versus Aston Villa, and that under this new arrangement Derby had lost four out of their six matches, harming their championship prospects to the degree that Ley broke a number of bye-laws, under threat of his Derby club withdrawing from the league, including refusing to field a nine on 6 August and giving the League Board no option but to erase the National League record of Derby. On 11 August the Birmingham Daily Post wrote that three of the four National League clubs were being financed by Spalding Bros, whereby Derby were financed by Ley, leading to various financial disagreements.\nOn 15 August the Derby Daily Telegraph published an article claiming that the Derby had won the National League, under Section 21 of the league constitution, under which it was said the club with the highest win percentage will be the winner of the pennant. The club claimed that up until their ‘withdrawal’ from the National League, on 5 August, they would have a win percentage that would have been unachievable for the remaining clubs, based on their completed season stats to that date. In reality Aston Villa were the first and only professional baseball champions of Great Britain, being awarded the pennant for the season, with Derby's record expunged from the official stats.\nDerby Baseball Club 1890 National League players:\nDissolution and new Derby Baseball Club.\nIn August 1890 a meeting at the Athenaeum, Derby, took place to discuss the idea of forming a new baseball club for the town. It was noted that Ley was to be elected as chairman of the new club, given that his old club had been dissolved. Ley agreed to the town's new baseball club being tenants of the Ley's Recreation Centre (known later as the Baseball Ground) rent free until the club was making a profit. It was reported that “for all practical purposes it (the dissolved club) was Ley’s Recreation Club” and the new club would be the real Derby Baseball Club. Ley also maintained his claim that his dissolved works club had actually won the 1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain and not Aston Villa, who were the official pennant winners. Ley also agreed to supply all uniforms and equipment.\nIt was questioned by the local population at the meeting who the new Derby club would have as opposition, if they were to remain outside the National League, to which Ley agreed to donate 50 Guineas to establish a ‘Ley’s Challenge Cup‘ for the new town club to compete for. By June 1891 Ley had withdrawn his offer of funds for the proposed Challenge Cup and stated that he believed baseball was dead in Derby. This lull, however, was short lived, with the Derby baseball club once again taking its place in the national championship within weeks of Ley's prediction of the death of baseball.\nSuccess at last.\nSteve Bloomer, and the Derby County goalkeeper Jack Robinson both made their first appearances for Derby Baseball Club on 5 May 1894 in a 33-4 win against a team selected from the other clubs who were affiliated to the Derby Baseball Association. Ley led the new Derby Baseball Club to a period of national dominance until 1900, winning the (now amateur) national League title in 1895, 1897 and 1899. A photograph of the 1897 roster shows football star Steve Bloomer still played at that time for Ley's Derby Baseball Club.\nDerby County name confusion.\nThroughout 1899 Ley set about encouraging regional football clubs to form baseball clubs, with the view to forming a new baseball league. As a result, a number of new rivals to Derby Baseball Club emerged, including a Nottingham Forest Baseball Club and a new Derby based club... Derby County Baseball Club.\nIn the 1900 season both Derby Baseball Club and Derby County Baseball Club existed in the same league, which appears to have led to confusion in modern history. In May 1900 a joint advertisement regarding season tickets for both clubs appeared in regional press, with both clubs having their own secretaries. In fact Ley's Derby Baseball Club was never commonly known as Derby County Baseball Club, so the new club appears to be short lived and the only time a real Derby County Baseball Club actually existed, contrary to popular modern belief.\nLocal news reports from the 1900 season make it appear that Derby Baseball Club were the continuation of Ley's official Derby club, with players including Saxton, Berresford and Booth still being on the Derby Baseball Club roster. In February 1900 a Derby Baseball Club roster was reported to still include Steve Bloomer, however on 27 June 1900 it was reported that Derby Baseball Club had defeated Derby County, sending Derby Baseball Club top of the National League. The Derby County Baseball Club roster for the game featured Steve Bloomer. Had Bloomer defected to the newly formed Derby County Baseball Club? At this point both clubs appear to disappear, though it seems apparent Ley's two successive Derby Baseball Clubs, formed from his Ley's Recreation Club, were never universally known as Derby County Baseball Club."

        "title": "Håkan Andersson (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Håkan Andersson (born 19 February 1965 in Stockholm, Sweden) is a Swedish amateur hockey scout who currently serves as the Director of European Scouting for the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nFormerly a fishing guide, he was hired as a scout by the Red Wings in 1990. Since then he has won four Stanley Cup Championships as a member of the Detroit Red Wings organization, in 1997, 1998, 2002, and 2008. Andersson, based in Stockholm, Sweden, scouts all over Europe including Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Russia, and has been responsible for the Red Wings drafting Tomas Holmström, Valtteri Filppula, Jiri Hudler, Henrik Zetterberg, Pavel Datsyuk, Johan Franzén, Niklas Kronwall, Jonathan Ericsson, Gustav Nyquist, Tomáš Tatar, and many others.\nHis scouting and player evaluation, along with that of former Director of Amateur Scouting Joe McDonnell and former Assistant General Manager Jim Nill, has been credited by Red Wings General Manager Ken Holland as the reason for the long-term success of the Red Wings, specifically the ability of the team to find talented players late in the draft.\nEarly life.\nAs a talented hockey player growing up, from the age of 10–14 he played with Charles Berglund on the IFK Tumba hockey club, and continued playing hockey until the age of 19 when, after having suffered a knee injury, he began his compulsory military service in Sweden.\nSometime after his military career was over he began working as a fishing guide with Frontiers International Travel, guiding clients such as Seymour Knox, founder of the Buffalo Sabres, around the waters of Sweden, Norway, and Argentina. After being hired as a scout by the Detroit Red Wings he kept that job part-time until the mid-1990s when scouting took over as his full-time career.\nScouting method.\nAndersson, along with several other scouts who work under him, has the responsibility of monitoring every league in Europe where future NHL talent might be found. From September to April every year he watches around 200 hockey games looking for players whose skill sets indicate they could be a fit for the Detroit Red Wings system. Starting in Stockholm, he moves on to cover the rest of Sweden, then Finland, and will sometimes go as far as the Czech Republic and Russia.\nThe primary focus of Andersson and the rest of the Red Wings scouts is skill. They will often draft players such as Pavel Datsyuk who were overlooked by other teams due to small size when they feel the on ice ability of the player warrants it. Generally Andersson likes to watch each player two or three times, but never more than ten times; too few visits does not give a full picture of what the player can do, while too many visits can result in \"picking on the player's minor weaknesses.\"\nOnce the season is over he makes a list of 65–70 players he believes could make it to the NHL. This list is merged with a similar lineup made by North American scouts to come up with a closing tally of 60 prospects that the Red Wings will seek in the NHL Entry Draft.\nScouting career.\nAndersson began scouting for the Detroit Red Wings in 1990 after being recommended to the position by Christer Rockström, who was leaving the Red Wings organization to work for the New York Rangers.\nWhile scouting in Sweden in 1993, Andersson visited the national team selection camp for players born in 1973 in order to scout players such as Peter Forsberg and Markus Näslund, and while there noticed a young Tomas Holmström. The next year Holmström caught his attention again when Holmström's coach at the time, Niklas Wikegård, described Holmström as the best player on the team. In 1994 the Red Wings for the first time gave Andersson a draft pick, their 10th round pick, meaning he had first and final say over who would be chosen by the team in that round. Andersson chose Holmström, who has since been part of four Stanley Cup winning teams in Detroit.\nIt was through happenstance that Andersson discovered first Pavel Datsyuk and then Henrik Zetterberg. In 1997 he went to Moscow to scout Dmitri Kalinin, noticed Datsyuk playing for the other team, and decided he needed to see more of Datsyuk. He made the trip a second time and would have come again, but the flight he and a scout from the St. Louis Blues were on was cancelled due to a storm. The Wings drafted Datsyuk 171st overall in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft and Andersson believes he was the only NHL scout to have seen Datsyuk play prior to the draft. The next year Andersson travelled with Jim Nill to a tournament in Finland to scout Mattias Weinhandl. Nill was distracted, however, by \"this little Zetterberg guy who always seemed to have the puck.\" Andersson and Nill came away with a very high opinion of Zetterberg, whom they drafted 210th overall in the 1999 draft, and he has matured into a superstar in the NHL. Their decisions to go with Zetterberg and Datsyuk have paid off handsomely. The two star centers were named as finalists for the Frank J. Selke Trophy in 2008, with Datsyuk winning the award, while Zetterberg set a new franchise record for most points in a post-season (27) and won the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the 2008 playoffs. In 2009 Datsyuk was named as a finalist for the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, having already won the award three consecutive times, and was again named a finalist for the Selke, both of which he was eventually awarded. He was also a finalist for both the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson Award.\nAndersson's good fortune in stumbling across prospects continued in 2001 when he happened to see a game in which Jonathan Ericsson, at the time a center, had been switched to defense temporarily due to injuries on his team. Ericsson had not garnered any attention from other scouts as a forward, but Andersson thought he was an excellent defender with great size and reach, and so recommended that Ericsson should move to defense permanently. The Wings subsequently drafted Ericsson with the last pick in the 2002 draft on Andersson's word of his potential as a defender, and ended up playing parts of 13 seasons with the Red Wings from 2008 to 2020.\nIn 2004 Andersson's luck seemed to take a hit when the Vancouver Canucks traded up to take Alexander Edler ahead of Detroit. Andersson had scouted Edler in the remote town of Östersund, where the youngster was playing in a local men's league, and due to the relative isolation of Östersund the only other NHL scout who had seen Edler play was Vancouver's Thomas Gradin. With Edler off the board, Detroit moved to the next name on their list: an unheralded 24-year-old defensive-minded Swede center named Johan Franzén. Franzén was big, had a heavy shot, with very good skating abilities for his size, and Andersson believed Franzén could at least be a good checking center. Andersson's expectations were exceeded in 2008 when, despite missing six games, Franzén set a new Red Wings franchise record by scoring 13 goals in a single post-season, a mark subsequently matched by Zetterberg.\nBesides Holmström, Franzén, Datsyuk, Ericsson, and Zetterberg, Andersson has also been responsible for the selection by the Red Wings of Niklas Kronwall, Jiří Hudler, and Valtteri Filppula, among others. In 2008, the Red Wings' top five post-season scorers (Zetterberg, Datsyuk, Franzén, Kronwall, and Hudler) had all been scouted and recommended to the team by Andersson.\nIn December 2008 Andersson's scouting ability was recognized by \"The Hockey News\" which ranked him No. 65 on its list of 100 People of Power and Influence.\nPersonal.\nAndersson and his wife live in Stockholm where they have recently started a family. In his free time he enjoys fishing, sometimes with former clients."

        "title": "Bounce (golf)",
        "text": "In golf, bounce or bounce angle is the angle inscribed by the leading edge of a golfing iron (particularly a wedge), the sole of the club, and the ground. In plainer terms, bounce angle is an indication of how much the sole, or bottom-most part, of the club head lifts the leading edge. A high bounce angle (angles of 12–15° are not uncommon) indicates a sole which lifts the leading edge significantly, whereas a club with little or no bounce allows the leading edge to contact the ground without interference.\nThe purpose of introducing bounce into club head design is to control how easily wedges, with their steep angles of attack, penetrate the ground under the ball. A low- or zero-bounce club has a streamlined profile, and the sharp leading edge of the club will tend to cut into the ground readily. When this is undesirable, the use of a club with more bounce will cause the sole of the club to impact first, keeping the wedge from digging into the surface by causing it to \"bounce\" across the surface instead. \nIn \"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book\", the word \"bounce\" is used only once. Penick mentioned it in relationship to an important wedge shot for tight lies. In addition to putting more weight on the front foot and striking the ball and ground at the same time, Penick said the golfer would play the ball off the back foot and square the clubface to the target so that \"the bounce of the blade does not touch the ground.\"\nIn practical terms, lower bounce wedges are advised for thin grass and tight lies, whereas those with more bounce are generally employed in deep rough or sand."

He coached at Oklahoma State from 1973 to 1978, amassing a career record of 35–31–2. His Cowboys earned a Fiesta Bowl victory in 1974 and his 1976 team ended the season 9–3 finishing as a Big Eight co-champions on their way to a Tangerine Bowl victory. His success at Oklahoma State earned him many accolades, including being invited to coach three collegiate all-star games: the 1973 East–West Shrine Game, the 1977 Hula Bowl, and the 1977 Japan Bowl.\nIn 1978, the Big Eight Conference initiated an investigation into the Oklahoma State University football program in response to allegations of violations of several NCAA rules and regulations while Stanley was head coach. Stanley successfully filed suit against the conference to require them to provide various due process protections in their final hearing on the charges. A decade later, however, the United States Supreme Court, in a case involving UNLV head basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, held that the 14th Amendment's due process guarantees were not applicable to the NCAA and similar athletic organizations since their investigations do not amount to the requisite action necessary for the constitutional protections to apply.\nStanley served as the defensive line coach for the New York Giants in 1979 and the Atlanta Falcons from 1980 to 1982 before moving to the USFL. Stanley was in the running to be the head coach of the USFL's Birmingham Stallions, but was passed over for Pittsburgh Steelers offensive line coach Rollie Dotsch.\nStanley was later signed by the Michigan Panthers to serve as their head coach, a position he held in 1983 and 1984. His 1983 team won the league championship after starting off 1–4. Following the poor start, Stanley recognized that his offensive line was too porous to allow rookie quarterback Bobby Hebert to succeed and so he lobbied management to bring in some veteran NFL offensive linemen to fill the gaps. Management addressed the issue by signing a bevy of experienced offensive linemen: Tyrone McGriff and Thom Dornbrook of the New York Giants and Ray Pinney of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Dornbrook and McGriff made USFL all-league teams in 1983 and Pinney was considered one of the best tackles in the league. The team finished the regular season 11–2 and then ran through the playoffs defeating Jim Mora's Philadelphia Stars. His 1984 squad looked like a favorite to repeat, going 6–0 to start the season, but then star wide receiver Anthony Carter was lost for the season. Combined with reports of player salary complaints, that led the team to go 4–8 for the remainder of the season. The Panthers were eliminated in the first round by Steve Young's Los Angeles Express, 27–21, in a hard-fought, triple-overtime game. It was pro football's longest game and the Panthers' last. Stanley finished with a 24–15 record in the USFL.\nAfter the season, the majority of USFL owners, led by New Jersey Generals owner Donald Trump and Chicago franchise owner Eddie Einhorn voted to move the league to a fall schedule. Panthers' owner A. Alfred Taubman had no desire to compete head to head with his friend, Detroit Lions owner William Clay Ford. Following the vote, the Panthers delegation surprised the league owners and commissioner by announcing the team would be merged with the Oakland Invaders in a pre-negotiated conditional deal. The new team went with a new head coach, Charlie Sumner.\nStanley returned to the NFL. He joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as defensive line coach before moving up to defensive coordinator in 1986. He was a defensive coach for the Houston Oilers for six years before joining the Arizona Cardinals' player personnel department. He retired as the Director of Player Personnel for the Cardinals after serving in that role for 12 years. Stanley was involved in the acquisition of quarterback Kurt Warner by the Cardinals. Warner's play was key in leading the Cardinals to their first NFL Championship game in decades.\nStanley also served as an assistant coach at Southern Methodist University (SMU) and the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).\nStanley and his wife, Sylvia, have four children. Stanley suffered from melanoma and died on January 12, 2012, in Chandler, Arizona."

        "text": "The 2003 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 74th midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues constituting Major League Baseball, and celebrated the 70th anniversary of the inaugural All-Star Game played in Chicago, Illinois in 1933.\nThe game was held on July 15, 2003 at U.S. Cellular Field, the home of the Chicago White Sox of the American League. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 7–6, thus awarding an AL team (which was eventually the New York Yankees) home-field advantage in the 2003 World Series. This game was the first All-Star Game to award home-field advantage in the World Series to the winning league, a rule that stemmed from a controversial 7–7 tie in the previous year's edition. In the days leading up to the game, Fox advertised it with the tagline: \"This time it counts.\" Subsequent editions altered the slogan to \"This one counts\" to reflect the new method of determining the World Series' home-field advantage; that arrangement ended with the 2016 edition, where the AL team (which became the Cleveland Indians, now the Cleveland Guardians) also won home-field advantage; the AL would win the next six years, as well as the last four. The winning league had a 9–5 record in the corresponding year's World Series, with the AL going 6–5 in the 11 years it won the All Star Game and the NL going 3–0 in the three years it won the All Star Game.\nThis All-Star Game marked the seventh All-Star appearance for the Naval Station Great Lakes color guard from Waukegan, Illinois, who this year was joined by police officers from the Kane County Sheriff's Department who presented the Canadian and American flags in the outfield. Both the five-man color guard and the sheriff's department officers accompanied Michael Bublé, who sang O Canada, and Vanessa Carlton, who sang The Star-Spangled Banner. Bublé's performance of \"O Canada\" was not televised until after the game in the Chicago area, while Carlton's performance was followed by fireworks that shot off the U.S. Cellular Field scoreboard. This was also the last All-Star game to have the stadium's public address announcer announce the all-star rosters and coaches; the game's play-by-play announcer (in this case, Joe Buck) proceeds that custom starting the next year's game and onwards.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nAmerican League.\nNotes\nGame.\nGame summary.\nStarters Esteban Loaiza and Jason Schmidt were sharp early on, each throwing a scoreless couple of innings to start the game. In the third, Roger Clemens relieved Loaiza and threw a scoreless inning himself. Randy Wolf could not do the same, allowing Carlos Delgado to single home Ichiro Suzuki with the game's first run, and a 1–0 lead for the AL.\nThe lead would stand until the fifth inning, when Todd Helton gave the NL the lead with a two-run homer off Shigetoshi Hasegawa. The National League would go on to score three more runs that inning, on the strength of a two-run double from Andruw Jones and an RBI single from Albert Pujols, giving the NL a 5–1 lead.\nIn the sixth, Garret Anderson hit a two-run homer off Woody Williams to bring the AL back within two. Andruw Jones would get one of those runs back the next inning by hitting a solo shot off Mark Mulder. Jason Giambi got the run right back with a solo shot off Billy Wagner in the seventh.\nIn the eighth came Éric Gagné, who did not blow any saves in the 2003 regular season. The All-Star Game would prove to be the one blemish on his record for the year. Staked to a 6–4 lead, Gagne gave up a one-out double to Garret Anderson, who was replaced by pinch-runner Melvin Mora. Vernon Wells singled Mora home to make it a one-run game. Then Hank Blalock hit a dramatic, two-out go-ahead home run to put the AL up 7–6.\nKeith Foulke came in the ninth to try to earn the save. Foulke closed the door and set the side down 1-2-3. Garret Anderson, who batted 3–4 with a double, home run and two RBI, was awarded the game's MVP honors, a night after winning the 2003 Home Run Derby."

        "text": "Pat McCabe (born 21 March 1988) is a former professional Australian rugby union player, now practising lawyer. He played for the Brumbies in the Super Rugby, and Warringah in Sydney, and represented Australia at various age grade levels before a senior debut in 2010. He was a utility player, able to cover inside centre, outside centre, winger or fullback.\nProfessional rugby career /Lawyer.\nEarly years.\nMcCabe first started out professionally with the New South Wales Waratahs academy in 2006, where he participated on a development tour of England and Ireland. In 2007, he was selected for the Australian U19's team for the 2007 Under 19 Rugby World Championship. He helped the team's 3rd place in the Championship, after beating Wales 36–14 on 21 April 2007. His eye-catching displays for Australia in the Under-19's, earned himself selection for the Central Coast Rays in the inaugural and final season of the Australian Rugby Championship. He helped the team to a Grand Final victory, beating Melbourne Rebels 20–12. McCabe helped the Warringah Rats to the semi-finals of the 2008 (NSW) Shute Shield competition, before signing for the Brumbies in 2009. \n2009–10.\nIn 2009 he was selected for the Brumbies academy squad, and after impressing on a development tour to France in mid 2009, where he was the Brumbies 'Player of the Tour', he signed a full contract with the franchise for the 2010 Super 14 season. In his debut season, he played every minute of every game that season, the only Brumby to do this, making his Super 14 debut against the Western Force on 12 February during Round 1, where he established himself on the right wing (#14). After just 4 rounds he got a talk up from his coach Andy Friend basically just saying that he was carving it and had the ability to play for the Wallabies. Having been selected for the Australian Sevens team for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, McCabe was forced to put on hold his Wallabies dream. However, he withdrew from the Sevens team due to injury.\nMcCabe was first selected for the Australia national team for the 2010 Tri Nations Series – though he did not have any game time during the tournament. He was re-selected for the Wallabies for the 2010 tour of Europe; including test matches against Wales, England, Italy and France, plus additional uncapped matches against Leicester Tigers and Munster. He made his first appearance for the Wallabies against the Leicester Tigers, playing at Outside Centre, reappearing in the same position against Munster. However, his first test cap came against Italy, as a late substitute for Adam Ashley-Cooper at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, Florence.\n2011–12.\nIn 2011, the new 15-team format began, and McCabe continued his great form into the 2011 season. He started in 13 matches in that season, scoring just 3 tries. His impressive form for the Brumbies earned McCabe a call-up to the Wallabies squad for the match against Samoa. This was McCabe's first start in the Wallabies jersey, however the match is heavily remembered as Samoa's first ever victory over the Wallabies, winning 32–23 at the ANZ Stadium. Despite this, he went on to play every match of the 2011 Tri Nations Series, helping the Wallabies secure just their third Tri-nations title.\nMcCabe was part of the 2011 Rugby World Cup squad in New Zealand, where he made his World Cup debut against Italy playing at Inside Centre, in a 32–5 victory at North Harbour Stadium. He became a consistent starter under Head-Coach Robbie Deans and featured in the same position in his second and third games versus Ireland and the United States respectively. But an injury sustained the USA match, force McCabe to withdraw from the squad and was not expected to take any further part in the World Cup. But despite damaging his shoulder, McCabe returned just two weeks later as one of the key figures of Australia’s epic 11–9 shut-out of the defending champions South Africa in the tournament quarter-final. Incredibly, he then topped the team tackle count again a week later against New Zealand in the semi-final, despite being on the field for just the opening 47 minutes of the game, before his shoulder finally gave way and off-season surgery was required. \nUnder the new leadership of Jake White, McCabe started every match of the 2012 Super Rugby season. He helped the team secure seventh in the Overall Standings with 58 points, narrowly behind the sixth Sharks with 59 points. His skills on field and leadership off the field, saw McCabe became a new member of the Wallabies Test-team leadership group, along with another new member, Rebels centre James O'Connor. The groups' other three members are: Will Genia, James Horwill, and David Pocock. The group meets with Wallabies coaching and managerial staff to discuss team strategy, planning and off-field logistics. He began this role during the 2012 Rugby Championship, where he played in just 3 matches out of the possible 6. He continued on with this role during the 2012 European tour, where he suffered a premature end to the year, due to a cervical fracture in his neck, sustained during the opening Test of the Spring Tour against France in Paris.\n2013–14.\nDespite his neck injury in late 2012, and numerous suggestions of retirement, McCabe was determined to recover and continue on with Rugby. He returned to professional rugby on 5 April, during Round 8 of the 2013 Super Rugby season. He then played the next six matches in hope of being selected for the Wallabies squad that would face the British and Irish Lions. On 10 June, McCabe was named in the 31-man squad, and on 20 June he was named on the bench for the first test at Suncorp Stadium. He made his appearance just 1 minute into the game, when starting inside centre Christian Lealiifano was replaced due to a heavy collision with Lions centre Jonathan Davies. Though, McCabe was only on the pitch for 45 minutes, when he reinjured the same part of his neck that he did in 2012, a end of year injury.\nThrough the injury, McCabe was unable to take part in the 2013 Super Rugby Final between the Brumbies and Chiefs - that match was won by the Chiefs 27–22.\nMcCabe returned to Rugby on 22 February 2014, round 2 of the 2014 Super Rugby season. He played in 17 out of 18 matches that season, helping the team to an Australian derby semi-final against the eventual champions New South Wales Waratahs. His form throughout the 2014 Super Rugby Season, saw McCabe selected for the first time by Ewen McKenzie, where he played twice of the bench during the French Test Series. He was then reselected for the 2014 Rugby Championship, playing on the wing (#14) in the opening two rounds against the All Blacks. However, during the second round, he was replaced at the 62-minute, following a third neck injury that he picked up in 2012 and 2013.\nThen on 28 August, Pat McCabe confirmed his retirement saying \"it wasn't a particularly hard decision\" after suffering a third neck fracture in less than two years.\n2016–current.\nIn December 2016 Pat McCabe was admitted as a lawyer in the ACT. That same year he joined MinterEllison as a lawyer in the Commercial and Regulatory team. In 2018 Pat moved into the Capital Markets and Corporate team.\nHonours.\nRepresentative Honours\nTrophies/Honors"

        "title": "John Cartwright (rugby league)",
        "text": "John Cartwright (born 9 August 1965) is the assistant coach of the Brisbane Broncos in the National Rugby League (NRL) and an Australian former professional rugby league footballer and former head coach. He was the head coach for the Gold Coast Titans. A \"strong running and skilful passing\" Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative second-row forward, Cartwright played his club football with the Penrith Panthers, winning the 1991 premiership with them.\nPlaying career.\nCartwright began with Penrith in 1985 and was a regular first-grade player by 1987.\nIn 1988, under the guidance of Ron Willey, Penrith developed a heavyweight, aggressive forward pack of which Cartwright and second row partner Mark Geyer were the cornerstones.\nCartwright had a sudden rise through representative ranks in 1989. Initially not chosen for the City Origin team, he took his place in the firsts team after a spate of injuries. John was the named on the bench for New South Wales for the first State of Origin match. Unfortunately, a late injury to Ian Roberts forced him to play in the front row, to which John was ill-suited, and John was dropped after one match. At the end of the year, John was sent off against Balmain and suspended for four matches. Penrith were thrashed 33-6 and could not win either of their two finals without John Cartwright. On returning from suspension, John Cartwright found form very quickly and at the end of the 1990 NSWRL season, John went on the 1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France but was dropped after one Test.\nInjury affected Cartwright in 1991, and Cartwright was used as a reserve in two of the three Tests against New Zealand. Following the 1991 grand final victory, Cartwright travelled with the Penrith club to England for the 1991 World Club Challenge which was lost to Wigan.\nCartwright had his finest season of all in 1992. During the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, Cartwright helped Australia retain The Ashes. John played in all three games for New South Wales (scoring a rare try in the third) and took over the Penrith captaincy when Greg Alexander was injured.\nAt the end of 1996, Cartwright left Penrith to play in England.\nCoaching career.\nAfter he finally retired as a player, John Cartwright became an assistant coach at the Penrith club and the Sydney Roosters. In 2000 he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. \nCartwright began coaching at Penrith as the reserve coach in 2001. After a period as assistant to Ricky Stuart at the Sydney Roosters, as well as coaching the United States national rugby league team against the Kangaroos in 2004, Cartwright was appointed the inaugural coach of the Gold Coast Titans after their admission to the National Rugby League.\nHe became involved in a feud with Melbourne Storm winger Steve Turner over contractual obligations. \"\"We flew him up, showed him around for two or three days and he agreed to me that he would come here, we shook hands. He looked me in the eye. The deal was done. He even started looking for accommodation. I only coached him in a couple of games at Penrith and my reaction has been the same as it would be for any player in this situation. But to do what he has done . . . I'm not happy. I'm extremely disappointed, to say the least.\" \"\nIn 2009, he was selected to coach the NSW Country Origin side. He later guided to the Gold Coast to consecutive finals appearances in the 2009 NRL season and the 2010 NRL season, the latter of which saw the Gold Coast reach the preliminary final. In 2011, the Gold Coast claimed their first Wooden Spoon under Cartwright's coaching.\nAfter four years without making the finals, on 5 August 2014 he announced that he would stand down as head coach of the Gold Coast, with immediate effect. He would coach the club one last time against the Sydney Roosters in Round 22 before Neil Henry taking over on an interim basis.\nIn February 2015, Cartwright joined the North Queensland Cowboys as an assistant to head coach Paul Green.\nOn 4 October 2015, John Cartwright was a member of North Queensland's coaching staff in the side's 17-16 Grand Final victory over the Brisbane Broncos.\nIn the weeks following the Grand Final win, Cartwright quit the North Queensland club and returned to Sydney as an assistant coach of the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.\nFollowing the 2020 NRL season, Cartwright was announced as an assistant coach for the Brisbane Broncos, working under their new head coach Kevin Walters.\nPersonal life.\nCartwright is the uncle of former Gold Coast Titans and Penrith Panthers Bryce Cartwright. Cartwright's son is Jed Cartwright who plays for South Sydney.\nIn 2020, Cartwright was a special guest on the Andy Raymond #UNFILTERED podcast!."

        "text": "Dennis John Bennett (October 5, 1939 – March 24, 2012) was an American professional baseball starting pitcher who played Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, Boston Red Sox, New York Mets and California Angels over seven seasons (–). Bennett batted and threw left-handed, stood tall, and weighed . He was the older brother of Dave Bennett, a right-handed pitcher who appeared in one MLB game as Dennis's Phillies teammate.\nBennett was born in Oakland, California, raised in the Shasta Valley town of Yreka, near the Oregon border, and attended Yreka High School. He was signed by the Phillies in 1958 after attending Shasta College and played four full seasons in their farm system before being promoted to the Majors from Triple-A in May 1962. He had a strong rookie campaign, appearing in 31 games, including 24 starts, winning nine contests with seven complete games and two shutouts. He struck out 149 hitters in 174 innings pitched and reached double figures in strikeouts in four games. But he was seriously injured in a car accident in January 1963 while playing winter baseball in Puerto Rico, delaying his 1963 debut until June 23. Nevertheless, he again won nine games as the Phillies finished in the first division for the first time since 1955.\nHe was the Phillies' opening day starting pitcher in 1964 against the Mets and did not record a decision in a game the Phils eventually won, 5–3, behind reliever Johnny Klippstein. Bennett took a regular turn in the 1964 Phillies' starting rotation but a lingering shoulder injury, a leftover from his winter 1963 car accident, began to limit his effectiveness in the season's final weeks. In late September, during the Phillies' disastrous ten-game losing streak that knocked them out of first place, Bennett lost his only two starts: September 23 against the Cincinnati Reds and then six days later against the St. Louis Cardinals. In November, he was traded to the Red Sox for slugging first baseman Dick Stuart.\nA sore arm plagued Bennett during his Red Sox tenure: he made 42 starts in almost years, with the lone highlight a complete game, 4–0 shutout against the Angels on May 1, 1967—a game in which Bennett helped his own cause with a three-run home run off Jorge Rubio. He had another complete game win against the Angels on May 30 (a five-hit, 6–1 triumph), but a little more than three weeks later, he was traded on waivers to the Mets. During his half-season with Boston, he contributed four wins to the 1967 Red Sox, who unexpectedly won the American League pennant on the season's final day.\nAfter going 1–1 with the 1967 Mets, Bennett played at the Triple-A level in the Chicago Cubs' organization before landing with the 1968 Angels, where he went winless in five decisions over the season's final two months. In a seven-season MLB career and in 182 games pitched, Bennett posted a 43–47 record with 572 strikeouts and a 3.69 ERA in 863 innings pitched, including six shutouts and 28 complete games. He played in the minors into 1973 before retiring from the game.\nDeath.\nUpon leaving baseball, Bennett owned a bar in Klamath Falls, Oregon.\nHe died, aged 72, on March 24, 2012, at his Klamath Falls home."

        "text": "The UCI Track Cycling World Championships are the set of world championship events for the various disciplines and distances in track cycling. They are regulated by the Union Cycliste Internationale. Before 1900, they were administered by the UCI's predecessor, the International Cycling Association (ICA).\nCurrent events include: time trial, keirin, individual pursuit, team pursuit, points race, scratch race, sprint, team sprint, omnium, madison and elimination race. Women's events are generally shorter than men's. Events which are no longer held include the motor paced events and tandem events.\nHistory.\nWorld championships were first held in 1893, in Chicago, under the ICA. They were for amateurs. Separate professional races were held from 1895, in Cologne. Amateurs and professionals competed in separate events until 1993, after which they raced together in \"open\" races. Championships are open to riders selected by their national cycling association. They compete in the colours of their country.\nThe winner of ICA championships received a gold medal. The UCI awards a gold medal and a rainbow jersey to the winner. Silver and bronze medals are awarded to the second and third place contestants. World champions wear their rainbow jersey until the following year's championship, but they may wear it only in the type of event in which they won it. Former champions can wear rainbow cuffs to their everyday jerseys.\nWorld track championships are allocated to different countries each year. They are run by that country's national cycling association, although the top referees (President of the Commissaire's panel – PCP, Secretary, Starter, and Judge Referee) are International Commissaires appointed by the UCI.\nVenues.\nTo take advantage of the best weather conditions and reduce the risk of weather-related program changes, the UCI has long organized track world championships in the summer. Until 1966, the competition must by regulation take place on an open-air velodrome. It was not until the 1969 edition, organized at the Antwerps Sportpaleis, that the first championship was held on an indoor velodrome. From 1987, the trend reversed and indoor velodromes took over. From 1987 to 1995, there were five world championships organized on an indoor velodrome. Colombia hosts in 1995 the last track world championship organized outdoor.\nMost successful athletes.\n\"Updated after the 2023 World Championships.\""

He has been ranked as high as world No. 21 in singles by the ATP, which he achieved on 7 August 2023. He is the current British No. 3 in singles. He reached a career-high ranking of world No. 52 in doubles on 26 April 2021. In 2015, he formed part of the winning British Davis Cup team.\nEvans's four ATP Tour finals to date have been the 2017 Apia International Sydney (losing to Gilles Müller), Delray Beach Open (losing to Radu Albot), the 2021 Murray River Open, where he beat Félix Auger-Aliassime to win his first title, and the 2023 Washington Open, winning his first ATP 500 title against Tallon Griekspoor.\nEvans made his Davis Cup debut for Great Britain against Poland in September 2009. Evans twice won deciding fifth rubbers, against Slovakia and Russia respectively, helping Great Britain progress to the Davis Cup World Group. Evans also played in the semifinal against Australia, losing both of his rubbers, and was a substitute for the Final against Belgium, with Great Britain winning the Davis Cup in 2015, the nation's first success in the tournament for 79 years. The Davis Cup team was awarded the 2015 BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award.\nEarly and personal life.\nEvans, often referred to as \"Evo\", was born and grew up in the Hall Green area of Birmingham, his father is an electrician, his mother a nurse, and he has two older sisters.\nAt first, Evans played squash with his father, aged seven, at the local squash and tennis club, the West Warwickshire Sports Club in Solihull, only falling into tennis by chance a couple of years later. Once Evans had got to grips with his preferred racket it became quickly apparent that he had some ability and he began training in earnest, moving to Edgbaston Priory aged 10.\nBy the time he was 13, Evans had moved to Loughborough to live with a host family while training at the LTA's academy at Loughborough University. Of his time at Loughborough, he said: \"I was never the best at 14 and 15, in fact, I was probably the worst. I was smaller than the others and a bit of a late developer, but I always thought I was pretty good and in the end, I was the best.\"\nEvans supports Aston Villa F.C. and has a single figure golf handicap.\nJunior career.\n2004.\nEvans was a member of the British team that won the World Junior Tennis competition in the Czech Republic aged 14.\nEvans was guided by LTA Academy coaches Mark Taylor and Leighton Alfred, who both continued working with him sporadically over the years.\n2006.\nIn March, Evans won the junior title at Marcq-en-Baroeul, putting him at the top of the European under-16 rankings.\nThe Lawn Tennis Association withdrew him from the Wimbledon junior tournament for being, in his own words, \"stupid on court\".\n2007.\nIn April, Evans was invited to the Davis Cup tie against the Netherlands, as a hitting partner for Tim Henman and Jamie Murray.\nIn June, Evans had his first win on the ATP tour in the Nottingham qualifier, losing in the second round.\nIn July, Evans first victories on the Futures tour, after seven attempts, were at the Great Britain F11 in Felixstowe, where he won two rounds before being beaten in the quarterfinals.\nEvans reached the quarterfinals of the US Open boys' singles.

Evans lost the second singles match, Fleming and Skupski won their doubles, but Ward and Evans were both beaten on the final day. Evans' defeat was his fourth in two Davis Cup appearances and came against a player ranked 269 places below him at 521 in the world and who had never played a match on the ATP World Tour. This was described as a humiliating Davis Cup defeat for Great Britain, and led to the resignation of Davis Cup Captain John Lloyd. Britain was now threatened with relegation to the lowest tier of the competition.\nAfter failing to qualify for The Championships, Evans moved away from Birmingham to train at the Nottingham Tennis Centre, where he would be coached by Mark Taylor and Leighton Alfred.\nIn December, the Lawn Tennis Association announced cuts to its financial support for some of Britain's underperforming players from 43 to 30, after raising the standards it requires them to meet. This included Evans, who had been hailed as the country's most promising youngster but had in the past been criticised for a poor attitude.\n2011.\nEvans reached the final of three Futures and the semifinal at the Bath Challenger, which led to the All England Club awarding him a wild card for the Championships.\nAt Wimbledon, Evans lost a close first-round match against the 20th seed Florian Mayer.\nEvans' only title this year was the Chiswick Futures F11 doubles with Liam Broady in July.\nIn December, the Lawn Tennis Association reduced its list of funded players to 23, but Evans was added to the programme, with Julien Hoferlin becoming his coach.\n2012.\nEvans began the year by competing in a number of UK based ITF Futures tournaments, securing his first singles title of the year in Sheffield in mid-January, where he defeated David Rice in the final. The following month, Evans entered qualifying for the PBZ Zagreb Indoors in Croatia, winning his three qualification matches before ultimately losing in three sets to Guillermo García López in the opening round of the main draw.\nIn February, Evans was instrumental in Great Britain's 3–2 victory over Slovakia, in the Davis Cup Europe/Africa Zone Group I tie. His ATP record stood at zero wins from 10 matches, while Lukáš Lacko had reached the final ATP event in Zagreb only six days ago. Evans won both of his singles matches, defeating much higher ranked players. Evans dismantled Lukáš Lacko, ranked 211 places above him, and Martin Kližan, ranked 156 places higher, in the deciding rubber. These were Evans' first Davis Cup wins.\nEvans was ranked No 291 when he pulled off two of the most unexpected wins against the Slovak Republic. By April, he was down to world No. 344, having failed to defend his points from last year's Bath Challenger.\nEvans also received a qualifying wild card for the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, but lost in straight sets to Björn Phau.\nIn April, Evans was selected for Davis Cup Europe/Africa Zone Group I tie against Belgium. After Josh Goodall lost the first rubber, Evans, the world No. 344 pushed Olivier Rochus (#59) to the limit, but Rochus prevailed to take the match. Colin Fleming and Ross Hutchins won their doubles match, but Evans and Goodall lost their second singles matches. Great Britain were beaten 4–1, condemning Leon Smith to his first defeat as Davis Cup Captain.\nSoon after the Belgium tie, Evans arrived at the National Tennis Centre, to discover that his LTA coach, Julien Hoferlin had been assigned to Oliver Golding, the former US Open junior champion, instead.\nEvans was now unable to afford foreign travel, so he spent the next 12 months playing in Britain and Ireland, at ITF Futures level, as well as taking in one Challenger tournament towards the latter stages of the year. He won four ITF Pro Circuit singles titles during the year, all in England. This tally included two titles in as many weeks in September, dropping just one set in ten matches.\nEvans was stripped of his funding by the Lawn Tennis Association at the end of the year, having seemingly failed to convince the association of his commitment to the sport.\n2013.\nFor several months, there was a possibility Evans might quit, as his parents found it difficult to support his career with the necessary £20–25,000-a-year.\nAfter not initially being picked for Great Britain's squad for the Davis Cup tie versus Russia, Evans was given a last-minute place ahead of Britain's No. 3, Jamie Baker. Evans played valiantly in his first rubber against world No. 67 Dmitry Tursunov before losing in five tight sets. With Great Britain trailing 2–0 to Russia, the GB doubles pairing of Colin Fleming and Jonny Marray reduced the deficit a day later, before James Ward levelled the tie at 2–2 after beating Tursunov in five sets. The result meant that Evans had the chance to complete an unlikely comeback when he faced world No. 80 Evgeny Donskoy in the final rubber. Evans defeated Donskoy comprehensively in straight sets, thus securing what was described as a \"famous victory\". The last time Great Britain had come from 2–0 down to win a Davis Cup tie was 83 years ago against Germany, Consequently, Great Britain won a place in the 16-team World Group play-offs in September.\nAfter discussion with Davis Cup captain Smith, the LTA once again agreed to support Evans with a coach and conditioner. He could also practise at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton, and was now able to afford to play abroad.\nIn May at his first tournament outside the UK for 12 months, Evans won a clay-court ITF tournament in Båstad, Sweden, where he beat Grzegorz Panfil in the final.\nEvans was then given a main-draw wildcard for the 2013 Aegon Trophy in Nottingham in June, reaching the quarterfinal stage of the tournament. In the first round, Evans was dealt a tough draw but overcame fifth seed, and world No. 92, Ryan Harrison in three sets. He then defeated Australian-born Brit Brydan Klein in straight sets in the second round, before losing to the eventual champion, Australian Matthew Ebden in the quarter-finals. Shortly before Evans' victory over Klein, he was informed that he had been handed a main-draw wildcard at the Queen's Club, London, for the 2013 Aegon Championships. He won his first-round match comfortably, beating world No. 75 Guido Pella in straight sets. His fine form continued in the following round when Evans disposed of world No. 37, Finland's Jarkko Nieminen, in three sets. He had been a break down at 2–4 in the final set, taking four consecutive games to record the victory. It was the first time Evans had beaten a player ranked in the top 50.\nIn the third round, Evans went down to Juan Martín del Potro in straight sets.\nEvans received a wild card into the Wimbledon qualifiers, where he lost in the first round to Spain's Daniel Muñoz de la Nava.\nEvans reached only his second Challenger final in Vancouver, where he picked up some notable scalps along the way. He defeated top seed Evgeny Donskoy, eighth seed Olivier Rochus, and fifth seed Bobby Reynolds to set up a final clash with second seed and home favourite Vasek Pospisil, where he lost in three sets. This performance saw Evans rise to the top 200 for the first time, reaching number 194, and he also gained direct entry to the Comerica Bank Challenger. Evans completed back-to-back Challenger finals, defeating top seed Guido Pella for the second time this year along the way. In the final, he lost to American Bradley Klahn despite holding match point in the second set. This run would see Evans rise to a career-high of no. 169 and become Britain's no. 2.\nAfter coming through three rounds of qualifying Evans qualified for his first slam event in over two years at the US Open and his first outside Wimbledon. On 26 August at the US Open, he achieved his most impressive victory to date, beating 11th seed Kei Nishikori in the first round in straight sets, to become one of only six British players to beat a player inside the ATP top 15 in a slam since 1990. The others were Andy Murray, Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski, Jeremy Bates and Nick Brown. Evans made the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time, beating Bernard Tomic of Australia in the second round in four sets. He ultimately lost to 19th seed Tommy Robredo in the third round; however, this earned him prize money of US$93,000, almost half of his entire career earnings up to that point.\nThe 23-year-old reached a career-high ranking of 149, becoming British No 2, and consequently, Evans was picked as Britain's second singles player in the Davis Cup World Group play-off against Croatia in Umag on clay. Evans lost his Friday's singles match against Croatia's No 1 Ivan Dodig, ranked 35, but Andy Murray, playing in his first Davis Cup tie for two years, won both his singles matches and the doubles with Colin Fleming.\nEvans won the dead rubber to help beat Croatia 4–1, and return Great Britain to the World Group for the first time since 2008.\n2014.\nEvans began the year at the 2014 Qatar Open where he came through Qualifying before losing to Ernests Gulbis in the first round. In Melbourne, Evans entered the qualifying competition of the 2014 Australian Open as the 26th seed, however, lost in the second round of qualifying to Hungarian Márton Fucsovics.\nIn February he entered the qualifying stages of the PBZ Zagreb Indoors as the third seed, losing in the final round of qualification to Björn Phau, however he received entry to the main draw as a lucky loser after the withdrawal of 7th seed Radek Štěpánek. Evans beat Jan Hájek and Michael Berrer in the first two rounds to make his first-ever quarterfinal at ATP World Tour level. He then stunned third seed Philipp Kohlschreiber in three sets, overcoming a ranking deficit of 120 places. In the semifinal, he lost to Tommy Haas in three tight sets. Despite this loss, he rose to a new career-high ranking of 123.\nAfter losing in the first round of Wimbledon, his coach, Julien Hoferlin departed for his home country of Belgium, and told journalists \"He [Evans] has the potential to make himself a top-60 player, but he makes no sacrifices for his sport. He doesn't understand that tennis has to be his priority. For him, it's just a brief interlude in his life.\"\nEvans had a bad knee injury at Wimbledon and missed the last three months of the year.\n2015: Davis Cup champion.\nAt the start of this year, Evans played three events, but in March he was fined £350 for failing to turn up for the F4 Futures event on the Wirral, sparking fears about his commitment. He then disappeared for three months, struggling with a knee injury that sent his ranking to an all-time low of 772 in May.\nIn June, Evans lost in qualifying for three straight Challengers in Manchester, Surbiton and Ilkley, all on grass.\nAt Wimbledon, Evans lost his final qualifying match against Japan's Yūichi Sugita.\nHowever, since May, Evans returned to some kind of form, reeling off 29 wins from 33 matches, with four Futures titles, Egypt, Frinton, Felixstowe &amp; Nottingham, Roehampton finalist and a run to the semis of a Challenger in Vancouver, where he beat Czech Radek Štěpánek along the way.\nHis ranking recovered to exactly No. 300, and the fact that Evans beat Australian Bernard Tomic in the 2013 US Open, led to his surprise recall to the Great Britain squad for the Davis Cup Semi-final against Australia. Evans was not even among four contenders that GB team captain Leon Smith named for two singles berths just over a week previously, but was now picked ahead of the injured Kyle Edmund, who is 200 places above him in the rankings at 100, and the woefully out-of-form James Ward. Though Evans lost both his singles matches, Great Britain won 3–2 and reached the Davis Cup Final for the first time since 1978.\nOn 15 November, Dan Evans, ranked 271, won the Knoxville Challenger on a hard court. On the same day, Kyle Edmund won the Copa Fila Challenge title in Argentina on clay beating Argentina's Carlos Berlocq, ranked No 112 in the world and an expert on the red stuff. James Ward lost in the second round of the same event, though Ward, ranked 156, had also recently won a hard court challenger tournament.\nWith Belgium opting to stage the Davis Cup Final on an indoor clay court, Leon Smith chose to go with the British number two Edmund, now ranked 100.\nEvans and Dominic Inglot accompanied the nominated British team of Andy Murray, Kyle Edmund, Jamie Murray, James Ward, as hitting partners. Great Britain went on to win the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936. Evans and Dominic Inglot joined the team on the winner's podium, and they all received the same Davis Cup medals.\nEvans joined the rest of the Davis Cup team at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Show, where they won the 2015 Team of the Year Award.\n2016: Top 60 debut.\nIn January Evans entered the qualifying for the Australian Open.

Evans played eight doubles events this year, four with Lloyd Glasspool.\nEvans, Kyle Edmund, Dominic Inglot, Andy Murray and Jamie Murray were named for the Davis Cup World Group 1st round match against Japan.

In the final, he beat Russian Konstantin Kravchuk in three sets. This marked a major career milestone for Evans who by winning the title, broke the top 100 of the ATP rankings for the first time, and Great Britain now had four players inside the top 100 for the first time since 1979. A week later, Evans reached the final of the Busan Open Challenger in South Korea, but afterwards Evans had a poor grass-court season in the lead up to Wimbledon.\nEvans' ranking allowed him to enter Wimbledon without the need for a wild card. In the first round, he faced Jan-Lennard Struff, and won in four sets, despite suffering an injury in the fourth set. He defeated 30th seed Alexandr Dolgopolov in the second round in straight sets, enabling passage to a third-round match against 3rd seed and seven-time champion Roger Federer on Centre Court. However he lost in straight sets, this was only the second time Evans had reached the third round of a grand slam and his first third-round match at a grand slam since 2013.\nJohn Lloyd chose Evans to play World TeamTennis for the San Diego Aviators in August, but he pulled out with no explanation.\nEvans was named for the Davis Cup quarter-final tie against Serbia on clay, but withdrew, citing a shoulder injury after switching to clay, and \"a couple of issues at home\". Evans was offered a place in the Rio Olympics due to several withdrawals, but instead he continued on the Tour to improve his ranking.\nA day after the Davis Cup Serbia tie, Evans was in Washington for the Citi Open where he beat world No. 40 Grigor Dimitrov to reach the last 16. Although he eventually lost in the 3rd round against American big server Jack Sock.

Evans's groundstrokes are solid but not overwhelming weapons, especially his single-handed backhand, which he tends to slice. His game usually involves counter-punching and moving opponents around from the baseline, before finding an opportunity to inject pace and attack. He is known to be a tactical, adaptable player, able to use his variety to probe for weaknesses and disrupt opponents' rhythm. He often uses the backhand slice to neutralise the pace in rallies, and also the drop shot to bring opponents to the net, exploiting opponents too comfortable at the baseline. Additionally, Evans is a skilled volleyer and is capable of serve-and-volleying. His lack of consistent power from the baseline has been cited as a weakness, though he makes up for it with speed and defensive skills.\nImage.\nEvans has been referred to as 'the bad boy of British tennis' and 'the most egregious wasted talent in British tennis'.\nEvans has lost his LTA funding twice, because of his off-court behaviour and lack of commitment. Firstly as an 18-year-old, he went clubbing in the early hours, the night before a doubles match with Dan Smethurst at the 2008 Junior Wimbledon, which they subsequently lost. Evans was considered to have significant potential but his LTA coaches found his commitment frustratingly inconsistent over the years, so in 2012, Evans was stripped of his funding a second time. Evans's reputation as someone who likes a night out and a drink has persisted, but he insists it is controlled.\nIn 2014, the management company Lagardere Unlimited's sports agent, Stuart Duguid, said of his charge Evans: 'British tennis fans are desperate for another top player to get behind in addition to Murray. Dan offers something a little bit different – he's more edgy and unpredictable. He's a bit of an enigma.'\nPerformance timelines.\nSingles.\n\"Current through the 2024 Barcelona Open.\"\nHead-to-head records.\nRecord against top-10 players.\nEvans' match record against players who have been ranked world No. 10 or higher, with active players in boldface.\nOnly ATP Tour main draw and Davis Cup matches are considered.\nStatistics correct .\nWins over top 10 players.\nEvans has a record against players who were, at the time the match was played, ranked in the top 10."

After a splendid first half, leading 18–11, the second half was a more close affair, though Denmark managed to win 28–26, reaching the semi-finals for the second consecutive time in this tournament. In the semi-finals, Denmark was seated with Croatia who had beaten the defending World Champions, France, in their semi-final. Though the odds where in favor of Croatia, Denmark played their best match in the 2013 World Championship so far, winning 30–24 and securing their second consecutive World Championship final.\nIn the final, Denmark was up against hosting nation, Spain.

In 1957, the Tunisian Handball Federation was founded and was later admitted into the International Handball Federation in 1962.\nThe Tunisian national handball team has participated in handball world championships. In 2005 Tunisia finished in 4th place; becoming the second non-European team to reach the World Championship semi-finals after Egypt who was able to reach the semi-final match in 2001. The Tunisian national handball team won the African Nations Championship for a record 10 times (1974, 1976, 1979, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2012, 2018). The Tunisians won the 2018 African Championship in Gabon by defeating Egypt in the final match.\nHistory.\nTunisia is the most successful team in the African Nations Championship with ten titles won in 1974, 1976, 1979, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2012 and 2018, and played in the final eight times in 1985, 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2014, 2016 and 2020.

However, the federation dismisses him following the poor performance of the team during the 2009 world championship. He was replaced by the Tunisian Sayed Ayari and then, in June 2009, by the Frenchman Alain Portes, who signed a three-year contract.\nIn 2013, Alain Portes' contract was not being renewed, so he took over from Olivier Krumbholz at the head of the French women's team and was replaced by Sead Hasanefendić, back at the head of the national team for the following three seasons. In 2020, coach Toni Gerona is dismissed. \nInfrastructure.\nThe El Menzah Sports Palace, built in 1967, is the hall of the national team.

        "text": "Going (UK), track condition (US) or track rating (AUS) are the track surface of a horse racing track prior to a horse race or race meet. The going is determined by the amount of moisture in the ground and is assessed by an official steward on the day of the race.\nThe condition of a race track plays an important role in the performance of horses in a race. The factors that go into determining race track condition include the surface conditions, type of surface, and track configuration. The surface conditions are influenced by the type of surface factoring in soil type, and if the track is dirt, turf, artificial surface; plus surface density, porosity, compaction and moisture content.\nAustralia.\nPrior to a race meeting, an inspection of the racecourse’s surface is conducted by officials. This process consists of a visual inspection and the use of a tool called a penetrometer which measures the soil’s resistance to penetration. The inspection is conducted before the meeting to allow publication of the track rating for the benefit of punters and trainers. In the case of rain prior to a meeting, a much earlier inspection will be made to permit an early decision as to whether the meeting can proceed, before travelling horses depart for the meeting.\nTracks may be upgraded or downgraded while a race meeting is taking place. The main reasons for this is that sun/heat is able to dry out the track during the course of the day possibly resulting in track upgrade or that inclement weather and rain continues as the racing continues (track downgrade). Jockeys, too, will be involved in inspections made during the meeting if there is any doubt as to the safety of riding on a downgraded or wet track.\nOn December 1, 2014, the Australian Racing Board (ARB) put into place a revised 10 point system using ratings from Firm 1 through to Heavy 10. The revised system removes the terms ‘Fast’, ‘Dead’, and ‘Slow’ replacing them with ‘Firm’ and 'Soft’ while also retaining the terms ‘Good’ and ‘Heavy’.\nBelow are the official ratings recognised by all race clubs in Australia:\nAdditionally, a rating of AWT is being used to signify an All Weather Track, which equates to a Good (4) surface under some bad weather conditions.\nUnited Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.\nIn the UK and Republic of Ireland, there are seven grades of surface, which are:\nSince 2009, in addition to the official description of the going, British racecourses are required to report penetrometer readings on the day of the race. A penetrometer designed by Cranfield University and TurfTrax, known as the 'GoingStick', is used for these measurements. The 'hard' grade is rarely used, as a racetrack with this type of surface is generally deemed to be dangerous to both horses and jockeys. No races took place on tracks rated as 'hard going' between 2008 and 2013.\nIn Ireland the term \"yielding\" is used for \"good to soft\" going.\nFor artificial surfaces in the UK the official grades are:\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, different systems are used for turf racetracks and dirt tracks. Artificial surfaces (called all-weather tracks in official charts) use the dirt track rating system.\nFor dirt tracks the track conditions are:\nFor turf tracks, the track conditions are:"

He then went on to play in the 2014 NRL Grand Final defeat by the South Sydney Rabbitohs, and he also featured for England in the 2017 Rugby League World Cup Final defeat by Australia.\nBackground.\nGraham was born in Maghull, Merseyside, England.\nProfessional playing career.\nSt Helens.\nJames signed with Saints as a junior in 2000, eventually playing his way through the Junior Academies before making his senior début against Castleford in August 2003. Graham already had leadership experience after captaining the England Academy in a famous series victory in Australia in 2004. \nGraham played for St Helens from the interchange bench in their 2006 Challenge Cup Final victory against Huddersfield. Then-Great Britain coach Brian Noble selected Graham in a friendly against New Zealand earlier in 2006 in the Castlemaine XXXX Test in which he made a try scoring début at Knowsley Road. St Helens reached the 2006 Super League Grand final to be contested against Hull FC, and Graham played from the interchange bench in Saints' 26–4 victory. As 2006 Super League champions, St Helens faced 2006 NRL Premiers the Brisbane Broncos in the 2007 World Club Challenge. Graham played from the substitute bench in Saints' 18–14 victory.\nThe young prop made a name for himself in 2007's Super League XII, making 27 first team appearances and being named Saints' Young Player of the Year which has also seen him named as a contender for Super League Young Player of the Year, with competition from Wigan rival Chris Ashton. He signed a new contract at St. Helens to tie his future at the Knowsley Road based club until 2011. \nHe was named in the Super League Dream Team for 2008's 2008 season. James won the 2008 Man of Steel award, making him the fourth successive St Helens player to win the prestigious award having beaten rival Jamie Peacock, and teammate Leon Pryce. He follows teammates James Roby, Paul Wellens, Jamie Lyon, Paul Sculthorpe (two spells) and Sean Long in being named Man of Steel.\nHe was named in the Rugby League Writers' team of the year in 2008 and the \"Rugby League World\" magazine the following year in 2009. \nHe played in the 2009 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford.\n2011 would be Graham's final year at Saints as a host of NRL clubs coveted his signature. Canterbury Bulldogs and Parramatta Eels were thought to head the list of interested clubs.\nOn 27 April 2011 it was confirmed by club officials that St Helens joint captain James Graham will join NRL side Canterbury Bulldogs when his contract expires at the end of the 2011 season. \"We did everything practical to persuade James to stay,\" said Saints chairman Eamonn McManus. \"But we respect his wishes and ambitions. There comes a point where you have to just shake his hand and wish him luck.\" Graham left St Helens with a 4–5 record in finals (1-5 in Super League Grand Finals in 2006, and 2007–2011; and 3–0 in Challenge Cup Finals from 2006 to 2008).\nHe played in the 2011 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford.\nCanterbury-Bankstown.\nHe played 26 games in his début NRL season and was part of the Bulldogs team which lost the Grand Final to Melbourne Storm. However he was at the centre of the match's most controversial incident when he appeared to bite the left ear of Storm fullback Billy Slater. Graham denied the charge but despite inconclusive video footage was widely condemned and subsequently suspended for 12 matches by the NRL Judiciary in a hearing lasting ten minutes.\nAfter Canterbury captain Michael Ennis was ruled out of the 2014 NRL Grand Final due to a foot injury, Graham along with teammate Trent Hodkinson were named co-captains of the Bulldogs for the match. At the Bulldogs 2015 season launch, Graham was named the club captain for the club's 80th season, replacing former rake Michael Ennis. It was also announced that the Englishman will be joined in the role with newly appointed vice-captains, Aiden Tolman and Frank Pritchard.\nSt. George Illawarra Dragons.\nOn 5 September during NRL 360, Graham announced that he had signed a three- year deal with St. George Illawarra starting in the 2018 NRL season. The deal was confirmed by his previous club Canterbury-Bankstown and future club St. George Illawarra on 7 September 2017.\nIn Graham's first year at the Dragons, the club qualified for the finals and defeated Brisbane in week one 48–18 before being eliminated the following week by South Sydney losing 13–12.\nGraham played in the club's first 11 games of the 2019 NRL season but was taken from the field during St George Illawarra's 22–9 loss against Cronulla. Scans later revealed that Graham had suffered a fibula fracture and was ruled out for 8 weeks.\nIn Round 21 of the 2019 NRL season, Graham played his 400th first grade game as St. George Illawarra defeated the Gold Coast 40–28 at Kogarah Oval.\nGraham made a total of 19 appearances for St. George Illawarra in the 2019 NRL season as the club endured one of their worst ever seasons finishing 15th on the table.\nSt Helens.\nOn 25 June 2020, Graham was released by St. George to pursue an opportunity to go back home to St Helens.\nGraham played in the 2020 Super League Grand Final which St Helens won 8–4 in dramatic circumstances at the KCOM Stadium in Hull. It was Graham's final game as a player.\nRepresentative career.\nJames made his international début for Great Britain in the 2006, scoring twice in a mid-season international with New Zealand. He missed the Tri-Nations later that season after injuring himself during a drunken episode involving his St Helens teammates. He went on to make another three Great Britain appearances which would all come in the 2007 All Golds Tour before the nation would be ceased and split up into three countries: England, Scotland and Wales.\nThe following year in June, James made his début for the re-established England team against France in Toulouse. James would go on to play for England in one more fixture, against Wales in Doncaster, before being selected in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup team. He would go on to appear in 3 of England's 4 appearances in their campaign.\nHe was selected to play for England against France in the one-off test in 2010.\nDue to an injury to tour captain Adrian Morley, Graham was handed over the captaincy of England's 2010 Four Nations tournament squad, and in doing so became one of the youngest ever captains of the national side.\nGraham played in the 2011 Four Nations and 2013 Rugby League World Cup.\nGraham was the vice-captain of England at the 2014 Four Nations. He captained the team in their match against Samoa.\nAt the conclusion of the 2015 domestic season, Graham was selected to play for England in the 2015 end-of-year internationals against France and New Zealand. He appeared in the France test match where England went on to rout their opponents. He made history in the opening test-match of the series against New Zealand as he officially became the most capped England international, making his 28th appearance for England, since their re-inauguration from Great Britain. He expressed his pride and joy after realising he had now officially beaten Kevin Sinfield's record.\nIn October 2016, Graham was selected in the England squad for the 2016 Four Nations. Before the tournament, he captained the team in a test match against France in the absence of 'usual' captain Sam Burgess after he was unavailable due to suspension. Graham captained England to a 40–6 victory.\nIn October 2017 he was selected in the England squad for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. England made it to the final but were defeated by Australia 6–0.\nIn 2018 he was selected for England against France at the Leigh Sports Village.\nOn 9 October, Graham was selected as captain of the England 2019 Rugby League World Cup 9s Squad.\nHe was selected in the squad for the 2019 Great Britain Lions tour of the Southern Hemisphere.\nGraham announced his international retirement in September 2020."

The two games are very similar sharing the same physics engine and graphics, although \"Strike Force\" featured more locations as well as left-handed, and reverse-hook bowlers. LAB Rats assisted in the development of Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling so the game has the same physics engine, but has a more fantasy-oriented theme. Strike Force features 14 places to Bowl (12 in Fast Lanes) and 8 Playable characters. There are only 7 locations, but each has its own \"nighttime\" variant which is unlocked as a secret stage. It also features Golf Mode, Challenge Mode, Skins, and Tournaments. There are also 14 different bowling balls to use, such as the Lightning, and level specific ones like the Bone Crasher and Pharaoh's Magic.\nReception.\nThe Xbox version and \"Fast Lanes Bowling\" received \"mixed\" reviews, while the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions received \"generally unfavorable reviews\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. TeamXbox gave the game a mixed review about two months before its U.S. release date."

        "title": "Swingerz Golf",
        "text": "Swingerz Golf (Ace Golf in Europe and in Japan) is a sports video game released by Telenet Japan in 2002. It is a golf simulation game that allows the player to choose from 14 different characters, each with different strengths and weaknesses, to play on any of the game's 6 courses, varying greatly in difficulty and atmosphere. Along with normal match and stroke modes of play, the game offers a tour mode, which simulates the career of a chosen character, a mission mode, consisting of a series of challenges that gradually increase in difficulty, and minigames, including a sudden death style of gameplay and a near-pin style of gameplay.\nThe game was released under Eidos' short-lived Fresh Games branding, and is the only game within its lineup to be a GameCube exclusive, while the other four games were PlayStation 2 exclusives.\nGameplay.\nControls.\n\"Swingerz Golf\" was made exclusively for GameCube, so the controls are designed specifically for a GameCube controller. The player-controlled golfer can be aimed in any direction with the analog stick and can change clubs with the R and L buttons to in any distance or direction possible up to that golfer's particular power limitations. With the X and Y buttons, the player may raise up the camera angle, zoom in on the hole, or rotate the camera around to see what is around an obstacle. Hitting the B button will switch between a power shot and a normal shot. To swing, the player pulls back on the C Stick until the desired power level is reached, then flicks it forward. The accuracy of the shot depends on how straight the stick was moved. If it is nearly or exactly straight, the word \"Excellent\" will show and the player's character will regain a bit of stamina. Ratings of \"Great\" and \"Good\" mean the ball will fly more or less straight, but the player will lose stamina. A rating of \"Bad\" or \"Poor\" means that the character will miss the ball, hit it short, or hit it well off the mark. By holding the D-pad in any direction during the swing, the player may add spin to the ball to give it a certain flight pattern or behavior upon landing. On the green, controls are similar, but there are some added visual cues. Once the player has reached or is close enough to see the green, a grid appears, showing the player how a ball will react on any given part of the green. Pressing left and right on the D-pad will make the lines thicker and more bold, making it easier to see on televisions that have a lower display resolutions.\nModes of Play.\nThe primary mode of single-player gameplay in \"Swingerz Golf\" is the Tour Mode. In this mode, the player is given a series of tournaments and duels to play through in order to unlock new characters as well as specialty clubs and balls.\nIn addition to the Tour Mode, \"Swingerz Golf\" has an exhibition mode for both match play and stroke play, a practice mode, a survival mode, and a mission mode. In exhibition mode, players may play a game without any consequence to his current game status. Survival mode pits the player against successively harder computer opponents until he loses a one-hole skin match. Mission mode gives the player several levels of challenging scenarios to complete. Challenges include hitting the ball within a certain distance of the cup, hitting a given number of \"Excellent\" rated shots in a row, and holing out under par, among others.\nMultiplayer.\nAlthough \"Swingerz Golf\" does not support online play, it does support multiplayer gaming over one console. Up to four players or computer-controller players can play a match together, even if 4 controllers are not available. There are three modes of multiplayer play. These are stroke play, skins, and near-pin. In stroke play, two to four players compete against each other over 18 holes of any chosen course. The winner is the player who has the lowest score at the end of the 18th hole. In match play, 2 players play through 18 holes, competing for the lowest score on each hole. For each hole, the player who achieves the lowest score earns a point. The player with the most points at the end of the last hole wins. In near-pin mode, each player gets one shot per hole. The player that lands on the green closest to the pin wins that particular hole. Scoring and winning are the same as that of match play.\nReception.\nThe game was met with average reception upon release, as GameRankings gave it a score of 70.50%, while Metacritic gave it 72 out of 100."

From that point until the year 2000, all Japanese minor league teams used the same name as their NPB parent club.\nIn 1979, the Nishitetsu Lions moved their franchise to Saitama, with their minor league team leaving the Western League to join the Eastern League.\nIn 2005 the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles were formed to join NPB, and their farm team became part of the Eastern League as well.\nThe independent Niigata Albirex Baseball Club was added to Eastern League for the 2024 season."

        "title": "J. C. Martin (baseball)",
        "text": "Joseph Clifton Martin (born December 13, 1936) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1959 to 1972. Martin played the bulk of his career with the Chicago White Sox, but is most prominent for his involvement in a controversial play that occurred during the 1969 World Series as a member of the New York Mets. He ended his career playing for the Chicago Cubs. After his playing career, he worked as a White Sox color commentator alongside Harry Caray on WSNS television in 1975.\nEarly career.\nMartin was born in Axton, Virginia and attended Ridgeway High School where he was a member of the baseball, football, basketball, and track and field teams. He signed a contract with the Chicago White Sox as a first baseman before the 1956 season and was assigned to play for the Holdrege White Sox of the Nebraska State League. \nChicago White Sox.\nMartin made his major league debut on September 10, 1959 at the age of 22 as the White Sox were in the process of winning their first American League pennant since . However, he was called up to the major leagues too late in the season to be eligible to play in the 1959 World Series, which the White Sox lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.\nThe White Sox returned Martin to the minor leagues in 1960 where he played for the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League until he was recalled to White Sox in September as the season neared its end. In 1961, Martin split his playing time between first and third base, while batting .230 with five home runs and 32 runs batted in. In October, he was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team.\nMartin converted into a catcher in , after Al López convinced him to return to the minor leagues where he learned to catch under the tutelage of former major league catcher Les Moss. Regular catcher Sherm Lollar was at the tail end of his career at the age of 37; moreover, the White Sox had traded Earl Battey and Johnny Romano and had no catchers in their farm system. As the team’s regular catcher, Martin batted only .205 in and .197 in .\nIn , Martin batted a career-best .261, however, he also set a major league record with 33 passed balls (after committing 24 the year before)—due, in large part, to catching knuckleball pitchers Hoyt Wilhelm and Eddie Fisher. This record stood until Geno Petralli broke it in .\nThe 1967 season was memorable for the tight, four-way pennant race between the White Sox, the Boston Red Sox, the Detroit Tigers, and the Minnesota Twins, with all four teams still in contention entering the final week of the season. Martin was the White Sox catcher on September 10, 1967 when Joe Horlen pitched a no-hitter over the Detroit Tigers at Comiskey Park. He helped guide the White Sox pitching staff to a 2.45 team earned run average (ERA), the lowest in the live-ball era (1920 onwards). Despite the impressive performance by the White Sox pitching staff, the team only had a .225 team batting average and were shutout in three straight games, as part of a five-game losing streak to end the season three games behind the Boston Red Sox.\nAfter the season, the White Sox traded Martin to the New York Mets to complete a deal that had been made earlier in the season for Ken Boyer. In another deal that same offseason, the White Sox traded Tommie Agee and Al Weis to the Mets with four players (among them Tommy Davis and Jack Fisher) going to the White Sox.\nNew York Mets.\nIn Martin, as one of two backup catchers to Jerry Grote (the other was Duffy Dyer), played on a Mets team that shockingly won the National League East title (both leagues now had two divisions after expanding from 10 teams to 12) after trailing the Chicago Cubs by as many as 10 games in August. In Game One of the first-ever NLCS, which the Mets swept over the Atlanta Braves, Martin, pinch-hitting for Tom Seaver, drove in Weis and Ed Kranepool with a base-hit off Phil Niekro during a five-run eighth inning, the Mets winning the game 9–5. The Mets went on to win the World Series in equally surprising fashion, in five games over the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles.\nIn Game Four of that Series, his Mets leading two games to one, Martin was involved in a controversial play. With the game tied 1–1 in the bottom of the 10th and pinch-runner Rod Gaspar on second, Martin, again pinch-hitting for Seaver, bunted to the mound and, while running to first, was hit on the arm by Pete Richert’s errant throw, the error allowing Gaspar to score the winning run. The Orioles protested, claiming that Martin was running too far inside the baseline, but the umpires disagreed. Replays later showed that Martin had been running inside the baseline, which could have resulted in him being called out for interference. The umpires said they did not make the call, however, because they felt Martin did not \"intentionally\" interfere with the play. As a result of this play, the running lane that extends from halfway down the first-base line to the bag was added to all major league fields. A runner can be running in this lane and be hit by a thrown ball and not be called for interference.\nChicago Cubs.\nMartin was traded to the Chicago Cubs on March 29, , for catcher Randy Bobb. He played in his final major league game on August 12, 1972 at the age of 35. After being released by the Cubs during spring training of , Martin served on their coaching staff in . He was also a White Sox broadcaster alongside Harry Caray on WSNS television in .\nCareer statistics.\nIn an eleven-year major league career, Martin played in 908 games, accumulating 487 hits in 2,189 at bats for a .222 career batting average along with 32 home runs, 230 runs batted in and a .291 on-base percentage. Over his career, he committed only 45 errors in 3,447 chances for a career .987 fielding percentage.\nMartin caught five Hall-of-Fame pitchers during his career; Early Wynn, Hoyt Wilhelm, Tom Seaver, Nolan Ryan, and Ferguson Jenkins."

The other Clarendon schools (Eton College, St Paul's School, Merchant Taylors' School and Westminster School) have other affiliations.\nIn 2003, as part of a wider investigation into alleged fee fixing at UK independent schools, the Office of Fair Trading published an e-mail exchange between the bursars of Rugby Group schools containing detailed information about planned fee levels at each of the schools.\nThe case was settled in 2006, with 50 schools admitting that such exchange of information \"involved a distortion of competition and infringed competition law\", but not admitting to any effect on fees. The schools each paid a £10,000 penalty, and agreed to make \"ex gratia\" payments totalling £3 million to a trust to benefit pupils attending the schools in the relevant years."

        "text": "Essex county cricket teams have been traced back to the 18th century but the county's involvement in cricket goes back much further than that. It is almost certain that cricket reached Essex by the 16th century and that it developed during the 17th century with inter-parish matches being played.\n18th century.\nThe first definite mention of cricket in connection with the county is a highly controversial match in 1724 between Chingford and Edwin Stead's XI, which is recorded in \"The Dawn of Cricket\" by H. T. Waghorn. The venue is unknown but, if it were at Chingford, it is also the earliest reference to cricket being played in Essex as well as by an Essex team. The game echoed an earlier one in 1718 as the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Stead's team had the advantage. A court case followed and, as in 1718, it was ordered to be played out presumably so that all wagers could be fulfilled. Lord Chief Justice Pratt presided over the case and he ordered them to play it out on Dartford Brent, though it is not known if this was the original venue. The game was completed in 1726.\nThe earliest reference to a team called Essex is in July 1732 when a combined Essex &amp; Herts team played against the London Cricket Club. In July 1737, there was London v Essex at the Artillery Ground, London winning by 45 runs. In a return game at Ilford on 1 August 1737, Essex won by 7 runs.\nReferences are then occasional until 1785 when the Hornchurch Cricket Club, based at Langton Park, became prominent. This club had a very strong team that was representative of Essex as a county. However, the sources differed among themselves re whether the team should be called Essex or Hornchurch. But there is no doubt that Essex held important match status from 1785 until 1794, after which the county strangely and abruptly disappeared from the records for a long time.\n19th century.\nLittle was heard of Essex cricket from 1794 until the formation of Essex County Cricket Club on 14 January 1876 at a meeting in the Shire Hall, Brentwood. The new club did not achieve first-class status until 1894. The team played its inaugural first-class match on 14, 15 &amp; 16 May 1894 against Leicestershire County Cricket Club (who were also making their first-class debut) at Leyton. In 1895, both of these clubs and Warwickshire County Cricket Club joined the County Championship."

At the time of the Olympics, the complex included over 12,000 seats for tennis fans, a plaza area located around the stadium, and a stadium court plus 15 additional outer courts. The reconfigured stadium held 7,200 people, and two smaller courts seated 4,000 and 2,000. Although the park was in DeKalb County, the Tennis Center itself was in Gwinnett County.\nThe facility played host to the 1997 U.S. Women's Hard Court Championships and the 1998 Davis Cup competition featuring Andre Agassi and Jim Courier, which the U.S. won against Russia. The Stone Mountain Tennis Center also hosted a concert in October 2005 with Roberta Flack and Melba Moore.\nSince the Olympics, the ownership of the facility has transferred to the State of Georgia's Stone Mountain Memorial Association and then to Gwinnett County in 2016. The facility fell into disrepair since it closed in 2007 and was demolished in 2018."
