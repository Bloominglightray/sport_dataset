        "text": "The 2011 IIHF World Championship was the 75th IIHF World Championship, an annual international men's ice hockey tournament. It took place between 29 April and 15 May 2011 in Slovakia. The games were played in the Orange Arena in Bratislava, and the Steel Aréna in Košice. The Czech team was the defending champion.\nThis was the first time the independent Slovakia hosted the World Championships. However, this was the third time that Bratislava co-hosted the World Championships. The first two times were 1959 and 1992, each time with Prague, and while part of Czechoslovakia.\nFinland won the gold medal after beating Sweden in the final 6–1. This was the second title for Finland, and the most lopsided final since the knockout playoff format was introduced in 1992.\nTournament format.\nThe tournament is divided into four stages. The preliminary round, qualification round and relegation round use a round-robin format with each team playing every other team in its group once. The winner of a game in regulation time will earn 3 points, with the loser earning zero points. The winner of a game decided in overtime or in a shootout will be awarded 2 points, with the loser getting one point. Teams in the preliminary round are divided into four groups of four teams each; the last-place team in each group moves to the relegation round while the remainder move to the qualification round. The qualification round is divided into two groups of six teams each with the top four teams in each group moving to the playoff round. Games played in the preliminary round against teams in the same qualification round group count for the qualification round standings; therefore, teams who were previously in the same Preliminary round group do not play each other again in the qualification round. The relegation round is a single group of four teams with the bottom 2 teams being relegated to Division I of the World Championships. The tournament concludes with the playoff round, which is an 8-team tournament, to determine the winners of the gold, silver and bronze medals.\nIn the event of a tie in points at the conclusion of the preliminary, qualification or relegation rounds, the following tie-breaker format will be used:\nRosters.\nEach team's roster for the 2011 IIHF World Championship consists of at least 15 skaters (forwards, and defencemen) and 2 goaltenders, and at most 20 skaters and 3 goaltenders. All sixteen participating nations, through the confirmation of their respective national associations, had to submit a roster by the first IIHF directorate meeting on 28 April 2011.\nSummary.\nPreliminary round.\nThe first gameday in Group A started with an upset, when Germany went on to win 2–0 against Russia after goals from Thomas Greilinger in the second period and Patrick Reimer, who decided the game with a goal two minutes before the final horn. It was the first win for the German team over Russia in a World Championship and the first one since the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. After the second gameday, the group was decided in the outcome who advances and who would battle against relegation. Germany pulled another surprise victory over host Slovakia; after being down 4–0, Slovakia started a comeback but could only cut the deficit to one, losing by a final of 4–3. Germany was the group winner and advanced alongside Slovakia and Russia into the second round, while Slovenia finished fourth and went to the relegation round. The last time Germany won a preliminary round group was 78 years ago, in 1933.\nGroup B saw the first overtime of the tournament in a game between Switzerland and France. Julien Vauclair scored the decisive goal after 1:46 minutes played in overtime. Canada defeated Switzerland after overtime to capture first place, while France won against Belarus to go through to the qualifying round and sent Belarus to the relegation round.\nIn Group C, Sweden played against Norway and it was a back-and-forth game. Sweden went up 3–1 in the first period, but Norway fought back and at the end it was 4–4 after 60 minutes. The overtime went scoreless and so it went into a shootout; Per-Åge Skrøder scored on the first try for Norway and Eriksson missed on the first for Sweden and so Norway won 5–4, making it their first win against the Scandinavian rival in World Championship history. Sweden and the US team both got their second wins as the United States came back from being down 0–2 to win 4–2 against Norway. On the last gameday, Sweden captured the top seed in the group after a 6–2 win over the USA. Norway followed those two in the qualifying round after a 5–0 win over Austria, who found themselves in the relegation round.\nGroup D saw two wins from the respective favorites at the start: Finland and the Czech Republic. The picture was the same on the second game day, though Finland needed a shootout against Latvia to win 3–2. Jarkko Immonen scored the game-winning goal. Denmark needed a win over Latvia to advance and they got one after a shootout; 3–2 was the result, Latvia then saw themselves facing the relegation.\nQualifying round.\nEvery game in Group E was close, each was decided by one goal. The Czech team was still perfect after their fifth win, defeating Russia 3–2. Alongside them, Germany, Russia and Finland qualified for the quarterfinals and the Czech team was set to win the group with one more game to play. The host Slovakia was eliminated after losing to Finland 1–2. After the last game day, the Czech team was still perfect after winning 5–2 against Germany.\nIn Group F, Canada and Sweden played each other to determine the group winner, and the United States also qualified for the quarterfinals. Switzerland and Norway played for the last spot in the final round as Norway will face France which are already eliminated before their last game. Switzerland won 5–3 against the United States but they were still eliminated because Norway defeated France 5–2 to advance to the quarterfinals.\nRelegation round.\nAfter two game days in Group G every team had three points and so the last two games determined the two teams going down and the two that remained in the top division for the next year. Slovenia faced Belarus, while Latvia played against Austria. Belarus crushed Slovenia into the Division A with a 7–1 win to stay in the top division. Austria joined Slovenia in the second division after losing against Latvia 1–4.\nPlayoff round.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe quarterfinals started with the undefeated Czech Republic against Team USA. The United States started off better but Jaromír Jágr scored for the Czechs to take a 1–0 into the first intermission. Jágr scored the second goal during a 5 on 3 power play after a strong shot from the right side. The third goal came after a good combination over the whole ice leading to a goal by Tomáš Plekanec. Jágr became the man of the match after he scored his third goal four minutes before the end during another power play and the game ended in a comfortable 4–0 win for the Czech Republic.\nIn the evening game, Sweden took on Germany and scored the first goal in the first minute by Martin Thörnberg. Germany came right back and tied the game after two minutes as Alexander Barta was credited with the goal. Both teams had chances during the first period but Sweden took the 2–1 lead into the intermission. In the second period, Sweden went up 4–1 before Germany came closer by going 2–4 in the last break. Sweden scored a goal in the last period which was disallowed because a whistle occurred before the goal was scored, however Thörnberg scored his second goal of the night shortly after and Sweden won 5–2 at the end. Both, Thörnberg and Berglund were credited with three points.\nDay two of the quarterfinals started with a Nordic matchup as Finland faced Norway. After a scoreless opening period, Norway took the lead after Ken André Olimb scored on a penalty shot. Five minutes later, Finland had the lead after two quick goals. Jarkko Immonen scored his second goal to give Finland a two-goal lead before Jani Lajunen scored to make it 4–1 for the Finnish squad. Three of those four goals were scored during a power play. The third and last period went scoreless again and so Finland won 4–1, Mikael Granlund scored two points in the game alongside Immonen.\nThe last game of the quarterfinal round brought up a rivalry between Russia and Team Canada. Jason Spezza seemed to be the hero after he scored the first goal after 25 minutes and the lead held into the last period, when Alexei Kaigorodov went on his way to score the equalizer shorthanded, he went by two defenders to put the puck high into the Canadian net. Three minutes later, Ilya Kovalchuk scored to give Russia the lead. Canada pulled the goalie with a minute to go but they did not score, and Russia won the game 2–1.\nSemifinals.\nThe first semifinal was the matchup between the favourite and defending champion, the Czech Republic against Sweden. After the first period went scoreless Patrik Eliáš brought the lead to the Czechs after just 46 seconds into the second period. Sweden struck back twice with goals from Patrik Berglund and Mikael Backlund to take a one-goal lead into the last intermission. Jimmie Ericsson and Marcus Krüger scored to increase Sweden's lead to 4–1. Six minutes before the end, Eliáš scored his second goal and the Czechs gained hope again. They pulled their goaltender with under a minute to go but Sweden's Berglund scored an empty net goal. The Czech Republic was eliminated and Sweden advanced to the final with a 5–2 win.\nIn the evening game of the semifinals Finland played against Russia. Despite having a so-so tournament so far the Russian team qualified for this late stage of it. Konstantin Barulin was again the goaltender instead of Evgeni Nabokov and the first period ended scoreless. Mikael Granlund scored an airhook goal to take the Finnish team into a 1–0 lead in the second period. The goal has been noted by multiple media outlets worldwide as the finest goal in the tournament, and as one of the finest in the history of international hockey. In the last period Jani Lajunen scored the second goal before Immonen decided the game with the 3–0 goal, assisted by Granlund. Both players received their second point in the game.\nBronze medal game.\nThe Czech Republic took on Russia for the bronze medal. The first period was a wild one ending in a 3–2 advantage for the Russian team while Ilya Kovalchuk scored two goals. The second period belonged to the Czech team after Petr Průcha scored his second point and Roman Červenka his second goal in the game. After the lead grew to 5–3 Vladimir Tarasenko brought Russia back into the game making it a one-goal game before the last period. After Jan Marek scored to make it 6–4, the Russian team pulled their goalie with two minutes to go. The Czech's Tomáš Plekanec scored an empty net goal to decide the game and give the Czech Republic the bronze medal after winning 7–4.\nGold medal game.\nThe gold medal game was played between Sweden and Finland at the Orange Arena on 15 May.\nAfter a goal-less first period, Sweden opened the game with a 1–0 goal by Magnus Pääjärvi in the second period at 27:40. Seven seconds before the period's end, Finland's Jarkko Immonen scored to tie the game 1–1. Finland took the lead early in the third period, scoring two goals at 42:35 and 43:21 by Nokelainen and Kapanen. Sweden took a time-out before the last period's half but did not manage to regroup, and the tournament was decided by a clear 6–1 victory to Finland by Janne Pesonen's, Mika Pyörälä's and Pihlström goals.\nHost selection.\nFour nations, all located in Europe placed formal bids to host the 2011 IIHF World Championship. Those nations were:\nFinland withdrew from bidding before voting began in order to apply for the 2012 World Championship. Finland and Sweden would both later win respective bids to host in 2012 and 2013, but this decision was later changed instead for the two Nordic countries to be joint hosts of the 2012, and 2013 IIHF World Championship editions.\nAfter one round of voting, the winning bid was announced by IIHF president René Fasel on 19 May 2006, at the delegates congress of the International Ice Hockey Federation in Riga, Latvia. Slovakia's bidding cities received 70 votes, followed by the Swedish bid cities of Stockholm, and Gothenburg with 20 votes, and finally the Hungarian bid with 14 votes. The required 50% of the vote had been attained in the first round, which finalized Slovakia's successful bid.\nIvan Gašparovič, the President of Slovakia, was instrumental in Slovakia winning its successful bid, as he came in person to the delegates congress in Riga to endorse his country's bid, and convince the IIHF delegates of the viability of Slovakia. Gašparovič is himself an avid hockey fan and past vice-president of the Slovak Extraliga team, HC Slovan Bratislava.\nPromotions.\nOfficial song.\nSong \"Life is a Game\" by Slovak singer Kristina was officially released on 18 March.\nMascot.\nGoooly is the official mascot of the tournament. Goooly is a Gray wolf, and Igor Nemeček, the 2011 IIHF World Championship general director, said he was chosen because: \"Wolves are animals which are typically Slovak, evoking our forests and countryside\". Over 14,000 entries were submitted for a national contest to name the mascot organized in association with Radio Expres and the Slovak Ice Hockey Federation. It is a word-play on the Slovak words for goal, and/or goals (). Goooly, the mascot, was subjected to considerable ridicule in the English-speaking world because \"gooly\" is a well known slang term for a testicle.\nMotto.\n\"Slovenská republika. Hokejová republika. (Slovak Republic. Hockey Republic).\"\nAmbassadors.\nThe official ambassadors of the 2011 IIHF World Championship Slovakia are Slovak hockey players Peter Bondra, Zdeno Chára, Marián Gáborík, Ľubomír Višňovský, Pavol Demitra, Jozef Stümpel, Marián Hossa, Miroslav Šatan and Slovak President Ivan Gašparovič.\nVenues.\nThe Orange Arena in Bratislava, also known as the \"Ondrej Nepela Arena\", was substantially upgraded for the championship, in line with IIHF, Slovak, and international specifications, largely funded by the Slovakian government. Construction began on 23 April 2009 and was completed on 30 November 2010. More than €65 million (US$90 million) was spent to install a new roof, modernize facilities, build two new adjacent practice arenas, and bring the seating from 8,350 to 10,000. The Steel Aréna, also known as the \"Ladislav Troják Arena\", which was newly constructed in 2006, had a new €11 million practice rink built adjacent, between April 2009 and February 2010 for the World Championship legacy of future hockey development in Slovakia. The stadium would have the name Orange Arena, but only for the time of World Championship 2011 (29 April to 15 May 2011).\nBoth arenas were known by their Slovak honorific titles during the 2011 World Championship to correspond with IIHF neutral non-inclusive sponsorship rules. (Samsung Arena as the \"Ondrej Nepela Arena\", and Steel Aréna as the \"Ladislav Troják Arena\".)\nNations.\nThe following 16 nations qualified for the elite-pool tournament. 14 nations from Europe, and two nations from North America were represented.\nSeeding and Groups.\nThe seeding in the preliminary round was based on the 2010 IIHF World Ranking, which ends at the conclusion of the 2010 IIHF World Championship. The 2010 Olympics were included. The teams were grouped accordingly by seeding (in parentheses is the corresponding world ranking):\nGroup A \nGroup B \nGroup C \nGroup D \nPreliminary round.\nSixteen participating teams were placed in the following four groups. After playing a round-robin, the top three teams in each group advanced to the qualifying round. The last team in each group competes in the relegation round.\nGroups A and D played in Bratislava, and groups B and C played in Košice.\nQualifying round.\nThe top three teams from each group of the preliminary round advanced to the qualifying round. They were placed into two groups: teams from Groups A and D were placed into Group E, while teams from Groups B and C were placed into Group F. Every team kept the points from preliminary round matches against teams who also advanced. The teams played a single round robin, but didn't play against teams that they had already met in preliminary groups.\nThe top four teams in both groups E and F advanced to the playoff round.\nRelegation round.\nThe bottom team in the standings from each group of the preliminary round plays in the relegation round. The bottom two teams in the relegation round move down to Division 1 for the 2012 World Championship.\nRanking and statistics.\nFinal standings.\nThe final standings of the tournament according to IIHF:\nScoring leaders.\nList shows the top skaters sorted by points, then goals.

They are the following:\nIIHF broadcasting rights.\nTrailer.\nA trailer was created for the World Championship which is entitled: Slovak Republic becomes the Hockey Republic! (). The trailer starts with ice and snow gradually covering Slovakia and ends with Slovak hockey players jumping onto the ice and shooting a puck. The player who shoots has the number 38 on his hockey jersey, the same as the Slovak legend Pavol Demitra. It features the Slovak countryside, and Trojične square, in Trnava. It took a 70-man film crew, more than 100 extras, several 3D animators, and the support of the Slovak Tourist Board.\nOnline.\nFor the first time in an IIHF World Championship, a YouTube channel was created to promote the Slovakia 2011 tournament. A video campaign was launched on this YouTube website which featured the christening of the mascot Goooly, updates on the construction work of the arena's, and the status of general preparations.\nAn official Facebook page was also created for the championship, being only the second tournament to do so, after the previous championship in Germany. Its 10,000th \"fan\" was awarded a prize by the tournaments organizing committee."

Although playing throughout the 1904/1905 season, he missed the classic 1905 Wales win over the Original All Blacks. He is often registered in many sources under the name Billy Neill or Neil because the Welsh Rugby Union didn't want him to sound like he was Irish.\nRugby career.\nEducated at St Peter's School in Roath, O'Neill played rugby for St. Peters RFC. O'Neill was first selected to play international rugby for Wales in a game against Scotland as part of the 1904 Home Nations Championship. Now playing for first class team Cardiff, and under the captaincy of Llwynypia's Willie Llewellyn, Wales won the game fairly easily, despite the rough play from Scotland's Bedell-Sivright. O'Neill was reselected for the very next game against Ireland, which Wales narrowly lost. O'Neill played in all three matches of the 1905 Championship which saw Wales win the tournament and the Triple Crown for the fourth time.\nO'Neill missed the next Wales game, the historic match against the first touring All Blacks, but was available for Cardiff against the same touring team ten days later. He also missed the Wales game against the first touring South African team, though was fit and well to represent both Glamorgan and Cardiff against the Springboks. Glamorgan lost 6-3, but the Cardiff team caused the biggest upset of the tour by outclassing the South Africans 17-0, only their second loss of the tour. O'Neill was back in the Welsh squad the next season playing two of the games in the 1907 Home Nations Championship, and was in all four matches of the 1908 tournament. Wales won all their matches and lifted their fifth Triple Crown, giving O'Neill his second trophy.\nIn 1908, O'Neill turned his back on the amateur rugby union game by switching to professional rugby league. He joined Warrington, playing his first game for the club on 17 October 1908. After just two months as a professional rugby league footballer, he was selected for the Wales national league team, in an encounter with England at Broughton. He played one more international match, again against England, at Belle Vue, Wakefield in 1909.\nO'Neill played right-, i.e. number 10, in Warrington's 10-3 victory over Australia in the 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain tour match during the 1908–09 season at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington, Saturday 14 November 1908, in front of a crowd of 5,000, due to the strikes in the cotton mills, the attendance was badly affected, the loss of earnings meant that some fans could not afford to watch the first tour by the Australian rugby league team.\nInternational matches played.\nWales (rugby union)\nWales (rugby league)"

        "text": "Robert Walter Ellis (born July 3, 1950) is an American professional baseball player, coach, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers. Since his retirement as a player, Ellis has served as a coach and manager in college baseball and minor league baseball. He has also written screenplays and books.\nAfter a successful collegiate career for the Michigan State Spartans, the Brewers drafted Ellis in 1971 and brought him straight to the major leagues. He played for the Brewers during the 1971, 1974, and 1975 seasons. Over the course of his MLB playing career, Ellis played in a total of just 64 games spread out over three seasons, about half as an outfielder, with the rest as a third baseman and designated hitter. He played in the minor leagues until 1980.\nPlaying career.\nEllis attended Ottawa Hills High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he starred in baseball and American football. Drafted by the San Francisco Giants in 1968, he did not sign, as he hoped for a team that would promote him to the major leagues quickly. Ellis then attended Michigan State University, where he played college baseball for the Michigan State Spartans baseball team. Ellis batted .380 as a sophomore and .431 as a junior. He set Spartans single-season records with 14 home runs, 60 hits, 13 doubles, and 123 total bases. Ellis was voted college player of the year in 1971 by \"The Sporting News\". Ellis was named to the All-American squad that same year.\nThe Washington Senators were expected to choose Ellis with the first overall selection in the June 1971 secondary draft. Instead, the Senators chose pitcher Pete Broberg. After the Chicago Cubs selected Burt Hooton with the second pick, the Milwaukee Brewers drafted Ellis with the third selection. The Brewers immediately promoted him to the majors, bypassing minor league baseball. Ellis was the fourth player to go straight to the Major Leagues after being drafted without spending a day in the minors. The Brewers sold Mike Hegan to the Oakland Athletics, naming Ellis their starting first baseman. The Brewers expected success from Ellis, comparing him to Chris Chambliss.\nThis turned out to be premature, as Ellis batted just .198 in 36 games that year and was sent to the minors. The Brewers demoted Ellis to the Evansville Triplets of the Class AAA American Association, where he batted .300. In 1972, Ellis played for the San Antonio Brewers of the Class AA Texas League and Evansville. He spent all of the 1973 season with Evansville.\nEllis began the 1974 season with the Brewers. Despite hitting .298 in 47 at-bats, the second best batting average on the team, the Brewers demoted Ellis to the Sacramento Solons of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in June, when they acquired Deron Johnson from the Oakland Athletics. Ellis batted .296 for the Solons in 1974. In 1975, Ellis suffered an arm injury in spring training, and the Brewers returned him to Sacramento. Ellis spent all of the 1975 season with the Solons, with the exception of six games played with Milwaukee. Ellis batted .250 with the Solons in 1975. After the 1975 season, Ellis took out an advertisement in \"The Sacramento Union\" apologizing to the fans of Sacramento for his low batting average.\nEllis remained with Brewers' affiliates, playing for the Spokane Indians of the PCL in 1976 and 1977. A free agent after the 1977 season, Ellis signed with the Cleveland Indians organization for the 1978 season, and played for the Portland Beavers in 1978 and Tacoma Tugs in 1979, both in the PCL. He was sold to the Pittsburgh Pirates during the 1979 season, who assigned him to Portland for the remainder of the 1979 season, and for 1980.\nCoaching career.\nAfter he retired, Ellis became a coach in minor league baseball for the Chicago Cubs organization in 1983. He then served as an assistant coach at Michigan State from 1985 through 1990. He also coached the Anchorage Glacier Pilots, a collegiate summer baseball team in the Alaska Baseball League.\nIn 1991, Ellis managed the Everett Giants of the Northwest League from August 11 until the end of the season, replacing Mike Bubalo. The team went 26-27 under Ellis, but he was not retained as manager for the 1992 season. Ellis served as a roving hitting instructor for the Baltimore Orioles organization from 1995 through 1997. He was named hitting instructor for the New Britain Rock Cats of the Class AA Eastern League in 1998, and also served in the role in 1999.\nPersonal.\nEllis has a master's degree in psychology.\nEllis wrote an autobiographical book, titled \"The Outfielder\", which was not published. He also wrote a screenplay, titled \"The Tundra Ghost\", which was inspired by his time as an extra on \"The Slugger's Wife\". With Mike Schmidt, Ellis co-wrote \"The Mike Schmidt Study, Hitting Theory, Skills and Technique\"."

        "text": "Elections to Baseball Hall of Fame for 1960 followed a system established after the 1956 election. The Veterans Committee was meeting only in odd-numbered years (until 1962). The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players, and as had been the case in , elected no one. For the third time, the induction ceremonies in Cooperstown, New York, were canceled because there was no one to induct. This would be the last time until that no one was selected for induction to the Hall.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1930 or later, but not after 1954. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. A total of 134 players received votes; 269 ballots were cast, with 202 votes required for election. A total of 2,288 individual votes were cast, an average of 8.51 per ballot.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). Candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\".\nCopies of the 1958 and 1960 ballots are not available, reportedly listing \"about 400\" and 237 players, respectively. Eight candidates may have received votes for the first time who were previously eligible: Miller, White, Kress, Crowder, Danning, Keltner, Walberg, and Zachary (in table order). The votes for Ralph Kiner may have been write-ins; he played until 1955 and should have been ineligible. Lefty Grove received six votes despite the fact that he had already been elected to the Hall of Fame, in 1947.\nThe next ballot for 1962 did not include a list of names. Twenty-six candidates who received at least one vote in 1960 may have been eligible for the final time: Edd Roush, Hank Gowdy, Bucky Harris, Dave Bancroft, Joe Sewell, Nick Altrock, Joe Judge, Howard Ehmke, Eddie Rommel, Wally Schang, Cy Williams, Bob Meusel, Joe Dugan, Babe Herman, Lew Fonseca, Mike González, Marty McManus, Jack Quinn, Bill Sherdel, Sparky Adams, Ray Blades, Heinie Groh, Bubbles Hargrave, Addie Joss, Freddy Leach and Hans Lobert."

        "title": "Slalom skateboarding",
        "text": "Slalom skateboarding is a form of downhill skateboard racing that first appeared in the 1960s and 1970s and has made a resurgence in popularity in the 2000s. Slalom racers skate down a course usually marked by plastic cones. The racer tries to get through the course with the fastest time, while knocking down the fewest cones. Each cone typically carries a penalty of a fraction of a second (most often 0.1 seconds) which is added to the skater's time.\nDisciplines.\nRaces can be done in dual format where the racing is a head-to-head match, or in a single lane format where the racer is only racing against the clock. There are five types of Slalom race formats: Super Giant Slalom, Giant Slalom, Hybrid Slalom (a.k.a. Special Slalom), Tight Slalom, and Banked Slalom. The Super Giant Slalom, or SuperG, is characterized by fast speeds of 30-40 mph, very long distances between cones (up to 40–50 feet) and run times of around 1 minute. Giant Slalom is similar to SuperG but typically has shorted cone distances, more cones, and is often run in a single lane format. Hybrid or Special slalom is a combination of Giant Slalom cone spacings of 10-15' and tight cones spacings of 5-7' and is most often run head-to-head. Tight Slalom is characterized by very short cone distances of 5'-7' and has the highest frequency of turns. Tight slalom skaters will pass through 3-4 cones per second. Banked slalom involves skating through a course on banked walls, such as in a skatepark or in a drainage ditch. Banked slalom is similar to other forms of slalom except that it is almost never head-to-head and the course weaves through a non-level obstacle course, as opposed to a regular street where other forms of slalom are held.\nRules.\nThe most unusual thing about slalom skateboard rules is that skaters are penalized a certain amount of time for each cone that they hit during a race. This penalty time is added to the racers' run time. If too many cones are hit during the run, the racer receives a Disqualification. A DQ is often penalized in head-to-head racing with a severe time penalty that is rarely made up in the second heat of a head-to-head race.\nAnother group of rules known as \"Grass Roots\" rules may be used to simplify the racing environment. In grass roots rules, racers are allowed to hit a certain maximum number of cones. Below the maximum (often 5 cones) there is no penalty, and above the maximum is a DQ. \nIn all types of head-to-head racing, race order is determined by a qualifying time which determines the brackets for head-to-head match-ups.\nEquipment.\nSlalom skateboards are optimized to increase speed, turning, and traction. Slalom skateboard wheels are generally softer (durometers between 76A and 90A) and larger than a typical skateboard wheel (diameter 66 - 75 mm). This increases the wheels' roll speed and grip. Skateboard trucks for slalom racing are often hand-machined precision products that include high rebound bushings, spherical bearings, and precision ground 8mm axles. Slalom trucks are different from most regular skateboard trucks, having different geometry for the front vs the rear truck. The front truck provides increased steering capability whereas the rear truck provides a more stable trajectory. Wedged (or angled) rubber pads (initially known as Rad Pads) mounted under the trucks, shifting the angle of the king pin, can be used to achieve similar performance with standard skateboard trucks. Skateboard decks (or boards) for slalom racing are generally slightly longer than typical skateboards, while still shorter than longboards. They are also more narrow suitable for truck widths of 100 to 120 mm. Materials may include carbon fiber and foam cores, to increase board responsiveness and strength. In the 1970s and 80's they initially had significant flex which provided a smooth ride, but as competitions got more intense racers favored decks completely without flex such as solid wood, rigid maple ply or carbon fiber.\nRacers.\nSome of the early stars of Slalom racing were Henry Hester, Bobby Piercy and John Hutson. These skaters won many of the races of the 1970s. Immediately following the rebirth of the sport in the 2000s, with the organization of the 2001 World Championships of Slalom, put on by Jack Smith in Morro Bay, CA, racers such as Gary Cross, Paul Dunn, and Charlie Ransom dominated. In the following years some of the most successful racers were Kenny Mollica and Jason Mitchell in the US, Luca Giammarco (ITA) Maurus Strobel (SUI) and Dominik Kowalski (GER) in Europe for the men's division. In the women's division Lynn Kramer (USA), multiple World Champion, really stands out, winning more than 10 overall titles. Other top level racing women of this period include the 2003 World Champion, 1970's legend Judi Oyama (USA) and the Europeans Kathrin Sehl (GER) and Lienite Skaraine (LAT).\nIn recent years Joe McLaren (USA) has won more men's World Championship titles than any other previous racer, although he is regularly facing tough competition from Europeans such as Janis Kuzmins (LAT), Christopher and Michel Dupont (FRA) and the brothers Viking and Viktor Hadestrand (SWE). In North America the top contenders are currently Louis Ricard (CAN), Jonathan Harms (USA) and Joseph Kyle Smith (USA). Richy Carrasco (USA) a 1970s professional freestyle skateboarder and World Record holder of 360 spinning has also stayed a top contender and maintained a position in the top 10 Pro World Ranking for more than 11 years in a row between 2008 and 2019. Paul Price (of UK, now USA) has been a frequent traveler across Europe, North America and Australia and holds the record for the most races run. \nAmong the women Lynn Kramer still holds strong, but in 2018 Mare Erika Belta (LAT) won both the World Championship title in tight slalom as well as the World Champions Super Final tight slalom title, both times racing Lynn Kramer in the finals. The other women placing in the top three, in either of the three slalom disciplines, at the ISSA World Championships in Policka, Czech Republic, 2018 were Karolina Vojtova (CZE), Endija Ruja (LAT) and Alina Krasavina (RUS). As if 2018 was only a temporary exception, in 2019 Lynn top once again became the World Champion in all three main slalom disciplines: tight, hybrid and giant slalom."

        "title": "I World Cup of Masters",
        "text": "The I World Cup of Masters (also known as III Copa Pelé) was the fourth edition of the World Cup of Masters ran from 18 to 27 January 1991 and for the first time, it was held outside Brazil. It was held in Miami, and all of the matches were played at the Joe Robbie Stadium. The six \"Master\" teams were reigning champions Brazil, Italy, Uruguay, Argentina and for the first time representatives from England and Germany. The tournament involved the teams divided into \ntwo groups of three. Brazil won their third title, beating Argentina 2–1 in the final in a dramatic last-minute victory led by Zico and attended by 13,550 fans.\nAs part of the push to help make the U.S. soccer literate in time for the 1994 World Cup, the 1991 Pele Cup, which featured the six nations that have won a World Cup, was played at Joe Robbie Stadium. Five double-headers were scheduled between January 18–27, and featured Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina, Uruguay and England in a two-group, round-robin competition.\nThat was the first time this type of tournament has been performed in United States. Though, the Miami area historically did not prove to be a very enthusiastic audience for that kind of show, the organizers' aspect was to compete with the biggest sports event in the United States.\nKey players.\nThe tournament featured the six nations that had won World Cup championships. The year each nation won the title is in parentheses.\nArgentina (1978, 1986)\nForward Mario Kempes, 36, scored two goals in a 3–1 win over The Netherlands in 1978 Cup final. Fullback Alberto Tarantini, 35, was the heart of the defense in 1978 and 1982 World Cups.\nBrazil (1958, 1962, 1970)\nForward Roberto Dinamite started in the 1978 FIFA World Cup and was considered one of the most popular players in Brazil. He retired recently from Vasco da Gama. Zico who travelled to Miami injured was one of the leading scorers in Brazil's football history.\nPelé, who had recently turned 50, did not play in the tournament due to a movie commitment. The United States bombing of Iraq kept Brazil`s Paulo Isidoro home. Isidoro got off a plane back to Brazil for fear of war-related violence in Miami.\nEngland (1966)\nDefender Bobby Moore, 49, captained the 1966 team that beat West Germany 4-2 after extra-time in the final. Moore has 108 international caps. Ray Clemence, 42, appeared 61 times on the national team.\nGermany (1954, 1974, 1990)\nKarl-Heinz Rummenigge scored five goals in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, leading West Germany to second place. Fullback Paul Breitner was a mainstay on the 1974 FIFA World Cup.\nItaly (1934, 1938, 1982)\nPaolo Rossi, 34, scored six goals in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, including one in the 3-1 win over West Germany. Forward Alessandro Altobelli, 37, scored once in 1982 final, and led Italy with four goals in 1986.\nUruguay (1930, 1950)\nAlberto Cardaccio, 42, starred for the national team from 1970 to 1974, making 25 appearances. Fernando Morena appeared 21 times from 1974 to 1978 and starred for the Peñarol in Uruguay`s top league.\nSquads.\nFor the list of the squads, see \"1991 Copa Pelé squads\".\nGroup stage.\nOrganizers called the tournament as \"the most prestigious soccer championship ever held in the United States\". The six-team field is separated into groups of three. A round-robin series determined the top two teams in each group to advance to the semifinals. That was the third Pele Cup, the first to be held outside of Brazil.\nPelé gave the opening kickoff between England and Uruguay in a Group B game on 18 January 1991. Italy played Germany in a Group A game on the same day.\nBrazil won Group A with three points, Italy was second with two. Germany was eliminated with one point. Argentina, England and Uruguay tied with two points in Group B, but Argentina and Uruguay advanced because of goal difference. \nIn the beginning Brazil and Argentina, the most popular teams in the six-team Pele Cup, faced elimination, possibly leaving Julio Mazzei and tournament officials with a mostly European final four in a large Hispanic market. But eventually Brazil beat Italy 2–1 before 5,534 fans, in their last group game. Brazil, the most entertaining team in the tournament, fell behind 1–0 when Italy`s Roberto Pruzzo scored at 46'. Brazilian goalie Paulo Sergio deflected Pruzzo`s low, hard shot from 22 yards, then stretched desperately as the ball rolled away from his grasp into the net.\nBut Dinamite tied it 1–1 at 52' with a searing left-footed drive that left Italian goalie Renato Copparoni helpless. Dinamite snuck around Italian defender Claudio Gentile, chest-trapped an entry pass from Mario Sergio and in one motion released a shot from 8 yards. Zico the post-Pele legend who hadn`t played in 20 days because of a pulled thigh muscle made his first tournament appearance in the 61st minute. The post-Pele legend who hadn`t played in 20 days because of a pulled thigh muscle made his first tournament appearance in the 61st minute and made an immediate impact, as he gave Brazil a 2–1 lead when he scored on a rebound of his own shot.\nArgentina needed a two-goal victory over England to advance to semifinals. The Argentines had three goals by halftime and went on to a 5–2 win as Mario Kempes scored twice. Former Fort Lauderdale striker Pedro Magallanes assisted on the fourth Argentine goal.\nKnock-out stage.\nA crowd of 5,620 in the first semifinal saw the Brazilians play the inventive, attacking soccer made famous by the 1958, 1962 and 1970 World Cup champions, led by Pele. \nBrazil beat Uruguay in the semifinals with a 4–0 win at Joe Robbie Stadium. Brazil would on to defend their Pele Cup against Argentina, a 2–1 winner on penalty kicks over Italy in the other semifinal.\nForwards Edu, Serginho and Roberto Dimamite broke down the Uruguay defense with brilliant passing combinations and deceptive footwork. Serginho made it 1–0 at 12' with a hard drive from 18 yards after taking a pass from Edu, who drew in two defenders with a tricky move.\nDinamite played a give-and-go with Wladimir, who made Uruguay goalie Lorenzo Carrabs commit to a fake shot. Wladimir, a fullback, went around the fallen goalie and scored at 30' for a 2–0 Brazil lead. The third goal came on an open field run. Edu stole a pass in the Brazilian end, and fed Serginho, who led a 3-on-2 break into the box. Serginho passed up an open shot and touched a short pass to an onrushing Dinamite, who beat a defenseless Carrabs to make it 3–0 at 41'.\nItaly and Argentina played in a 1990 World Cup semifinal, which Argentina won 2–1 on penalty kicks. Thursday night the masters combined for five yellow cards in a spiteful game filled with harsh tackles. Italy thrilled fans with what may be the most spectacular goal of the tournament. The Italians strung together a series of about 12 passes that maneuvered the Argentines out of position. The possession was capped when Franco Causio passed to Simone Boldini whose cross was headed in by Allesandro Altobelli at 12'. Altobelli outleaped two players for the header.\nArgentina tied it 1–1 at 47' when Enzo Bulleri`s shot from 28 yards curved around diving Italian goaltender Ivano Bordon into the corner of the net.\nArgentina beat Italy 5–4 in penalty kicks, the clincher coming from Oscar Mas. Argentina keeper Hugo Gatti stopped Italy`s Silvano Fontolan on the third kick to provide the one-goal margin.\nFinal.\nArgentina, the 1987 Pele Cup champion, had 12 shots and forced Brazilian goalkeeper Paulo Sergio to make three diving stops. Enzo Bulleri gave Argentina a 1–0 lead at 25' when he drove a curving free kick from a sharp angle around a wall of defenders and past a diving Sergio. It was Bulleri`s third tournament goal, all coming on shots outside the penalty area.\nAfter Bulleri`s goal, Brazil started to get the better of the play. Serginho and Roberto Dinamite force Gatti to make diving saved, and Zenon hit the crossbar on a free kick.\nAt 44' Edu scored his second tournament goal to tie it for Brazil. Edu`s shot from 30 yards skipped past Gatti and skimmed the post. Argentina`s Carlos Squeo hit the post early in the second half, and Hussef Ali`s shot on the rebound was kick-saved by Paulo Sergio.\nZico has been hampered by a pulled leg muscle and played only 73 minutes in two of Brazil`s three tournament games. He entered in the second half against Italy and Uruguay and scored a goal in each game.\nBrazilian coach Luciano do Valle planned to play Zico in the second half against Argentina, but a leg injury to midfielder Mario Sergio in the 13th minute forced Zico to play 77 minutes.\nZico and Serginho twice connected on give-and-go passes in the box, but Zico could not finish. Gatti came off his line for a diving stop in the 74th minute, and Zico shot high from 15 yards four minutes later.\nZico scored the game-winner as the public address announcer was telling the crowd that penalty kicks would decide the championship if the score remained tied. Gatti came out on a crossing pass into the penalty area by Brazil`s Cafuringa, but as Gatti reached for the ball, defender Orlando Ruiz headed the pass away. Zico made a leaping kick and looped it over Gatti into the net.\nThat goal gave Brazil a 2–1 win before 13,544 fans at Joe Robbie Stadium.\nZico`s goal capped a fast-paced, end-to-end offensive game that featured 32 shots and brilliant play by Argentina goalie Orlando Gatti. Gatti made five diving saves and 12 overall, and was named outstanding goalkeeper for the nine-day tournament.\nItaly beat Uruguay 2–1 in the third-place game as Allesandro Altobelli assisted on goals by Paolo Rossi and Claudio Gentile.\nGroup A.\nResults\nGroup B.\nResults\nGoal scorers.\n3 goals\n2 goals\nChampion.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1964 followed the system introduced for even-number years in 1962. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players with provision for a second, \"runoff\" election in the event of no player receiving enough votes for induction. The runoff was necessary this year, with Luke Appling the winner. Further, the eligibility of retired players was reduced from having retired 30 years prior to election to 20 years prior.\nMeanwhile, the Veterans Committee was meeting annually to consider executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players. It selected six people: Red Faber, Burleigh Grimes, Miller Huggins, Tim Keefe, Heinie Manush, and John Montgomery Ward. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 27, 1964, with Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1944 or later, but not after 1958. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. A total of 58 players received votes; 201 ballots were cast, with 151 votes required for election. A total of 1,632 individual votes were cast, an average of 8.12 per ballot.\nNo one reached the threshold so there was a runoff election featuring the 30 leading candidates. There would be one winner regardless of numerical support on the second ballot; in fact, winner Luke Appling tallied 189 of 201 votes or 94%. A total of 939 individual votes were cast in the runoff, an average of 4.67 per ballot.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). Candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". Al López was later elected as a manager.\nChuck Klein, Lloyd Waner, Pepper Martin, Leo Durocher, and Lon Warneke were on the ballot for the final time.\nThe runoff results show that voters in the second election concentrated their support on the four leaders. Primary results indicate significant gains among returning candidates, with eight players gaining 20 percentage points or more. Between 1962 and 1964, the Hall of Fame reduced eligibility for players to be voted on by the BBWAA from having been retired for at most 30 years to those who had been retired for at most 20 years. This removed numerous popular candidates, including Sam Rice, who had received the most votes among players not elected. Among the 17 candidates to receive at least 10% of the vote in 1962, nine were no longer eligible due to the rule change. Combined with the two candidates who were elected, this meant that of the 17 candidates to receive 10% or more in 1962, only six were appearing on this ballot.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nRing Lardner (1885–1933) received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. The award was voted at the December 1963 meeting of the BBWAA, and included in the summer 1964 ceremonies."

        "text": "Shaun White Snowboarding is a snowboarding video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft for Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.\nThe Wii version of the game is titled \"Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip\".\nGameplay.\nThere are six mountains in \"Shaun White Snowboarding\", including Alaska, Park City, Europe, and Japan. Each mountain features up to three different sections: peak, back country, and park (or resort). There is also a \"Target Limited Edition\" of the game that is exclusive to Target; this version gives the player access to \"Target Mountain\", a mountain with Target branding all over it. It has been described in-game as extremely difficult to find, and contains additional jibs, character models, and a sponsored version of the standard game's best snowboard which can be unlocked before the player's final challenge against Shaun White. The last mountain, called \"B.C.\", is only available in the \"Mile-High Pack\" paid downloadable content. It is set in British Columbia.\nAs players progress through the game, they will earn abilities that will help them. Some of the abilities consist of gaining high speeds or the ability to break through obstacles to progress further.\nReception.\nThe Wii version of the game received more positive reception than any of the other versions. Eurogamer gave the Wii version 7/10, praising it as \"the best looking version\", singling out the presentation, soundtrack, implementation of the Wii Balance Board controls and multiplayer, while criticizing the Wii Remote controls, half-pipe sections, difficulty level, and short duration of the single-player mode.\nDaemon Hatfield of \"IGN\" said that \"A kid-friendly, motion-controlled version of Shaun White Snowboarding could have been a disaster, but this turns out to be a truly slick edition of the franchise.\"\nThe Wii version of \"Shaun White Snowboarding\" was the 20th best-selling game of December 2008 in the United States, and it was the best selling version. Over 3 million copies of the game had been sold as of May 2009.\nThe Wii version was a nominee for several Wii-specific awards from IGN in its 2008 video game awards, including Best New IP, Best Sports Game, Best Graphics Technology, Best Use of the Balance Board, and Game of the Year. The Xbox 360 version was nominated for \"Worst Game Everyone Played\" by \"GameSpot\" in their 2008 video game awards, and was awarded the title of \"Most Dubious Use of In-Game Advertising\" for excluding 20% of its content from editions not sold from the Target Stores editions.\nSequel and spin-off.\nIn the many months that followed \"Snowboardings release, Ubisoft Montreal developed a sequel, ' and a spin-off, \"Shaun White Skateboarding\". The former was released exclusively for the Wii and supported the Wii Balance Board and Wii Motion Plus. \nAn iOS game titled \"Shaun White Snowboarding: Origins\" was released in December 2009."

        "text": "Wang Tao (; born December 13, 1967, in Beijing) is a retired Chinese table tennis player, the current head coach of the Bayi Gongshang club in the China Table Tennis Super League, and a member of the Chinese Olympic Committee.\nWang Tao is a left-handed player who utilizes the shakehand grip, known for using short pimpled rubber on his backhand and regular inverted rubber on his forehand. Due to the special characteristics of short pimpled rubber being able to hit through and resist spin, Wang Tao's play style is unique, as he was able to rely on the quick hitting motion on his backhand to directly attack serves with heavy spin or make controlled shots at wide angles against his opponents. Wang Tao positions himself close to the table, attacking with great speed and surprising his opponents with unexpected shots. \nWang Tao was an influential figure, making great contributions to the revival of Chinese dominance in the sport of table tennis in a time when European countries like Sweden and Austria dominated the world stage (winning the men's team event during the 1995 table tennis world championships). \nWang Tao was mentioned in season 4, episode 8 of the American television series The Office. In the episode, entitled \"The Deposition\", the character Dwight Schrute mentions Wang Tao as one of his table tennis heroes."

        "text": "The 1997 Women's Cricket World Cup, also known as the Hero Honda Women's World Cup, was the sixth edition of the Women's Cricket World Cup, held in India. With 32 matches between a record 11 teams across 25 cricket grounds, England, Australia, New Zealand and India reached the semi-finals, with Australia and New Zealand progressing to the final match, which was played on 29 December 1997. Australia defeated New Zealand by five wickets to win their fourth championship title.\nThe 1997 World Cup also set a number of records for the tournament. In their match against Denmark, Australia scored the highest team score in a World Cup, 412/3, and achieved the largest winning margin in a World Cup, 363 runs. In the same match, Australia's Belinda Clark scored 229*, the highest individual score in a World Cup. Australia also bowled out Pakistan for 27 in 82 balls, the shortest completed innings in a Women's One Day International.\nGroup stage.\nThe competition began with twenty-five matches between 11 teams, the highest participation of any Women's Cricket World Cup to date. After these matches, Australia, England, the Netherlands, Sri Lanka, India, South Africa, Ireland and New Zealand reached the quarter finals stage, while Denmark, Pakistan and the West Indies were eliminated. The first three matches of this stage were rained off without a ball being bowled, due to torrential storms on 9 and 10 December.\nKnockout stage.\nSemi-finals.\nIndia and Australia both qualified for the semi-finals, and faced each other on Christmas Eve at Delhi. The start of the match was delayed for two hours and 15 minutes for bad light, and as a result each side was given 32 overs to bat. India won the toss, and captain Pramila Bhatt chose to field first. Australia, put into bat, began well with an opening partnership of 66 between captain Belinda Clark (31) and Joanne Broadbent (33). Bhatt herself broke the partnership, reducing Australia from 66/0 to 83/3 with the wickets of Bhatt, Mel Jones (5) and Michelle Goszko (0), ending with figures of 3/25. A knock of 23 from Karen Rolton and support from Bronwyn Calver (11) saw Australia past 100, however both Olivia Magno and Charmaine Mason were stumped by Anju Jain off the bowling of Neetu David for ducks, and Australia managed 123 from their 32 overs. For slow bowling, two overs were deducted from India's batting innings.\nIndia's reply did not begin as successfully, falling to 24/2 with both Jain and Anjum Chopra out cheaply for 18 and two respectively. Chanderkanta Kaul scored 48, however only two other players reached double figures, and together with Smitha Harikrishna and Renu Margrate (both scoring one) they were all run out. Bhatt hit six runs herself before she was bowled by Cathryn Fitzpatrick, who took 3/18. India's last three players all failed to score, and she fell 19 runs short by the end of her 30 overs on 104/9.\nOn Boxing Day, England and New Zealand faced each other in the second semi final at Chepauk, in Chennai. New Zealand won the toss, and captain Maia Lewis chose to bat first. New Zealand lost the early wicket of Emily Drumm for four, however they went on to a score of 93 before another wicker fell. Debbie Hockley top scored with 43, and Shelley Fruin (29), Katrina Keenan (35) and 28 extras took New Zealand to 175/6 from their 50 overs. England's bowlers bowled economically, with three going at economy rates of under 2.90, and medium-pacer Karen Smithies took 3/40.\nEngland, set 176 runs from 49 overs, having been fined one over for their own slow over rate, reached 100 for the loss of four wickets, with Charlotte Edwards scoring 25, Jan Brittin 32 and Barbara Daniels 30. Only two other players reached double figures, however, as England slumped from 100/4 to 155 all out from 47.5 overs. Clare Nicholson took 2/29 for New Zealand, with Katrina Keenan, Hockley, Catherine Campbell and Sarah McLauchlan taking one wicked each, and the remaining four England players being run out. This gave New Zealand a 20 run victory, and they progressed to the finals.\nFinal.\nThe final between Australia and New Zealand took place on 29 December at Eden Gardens in Calcutta, in front of an estimated crowd of at least 50–60,000 spectators. New Zealand won the toss, with captain Maia Lewis choosing to bat first. New Zealand began poorly, losing Emily Drumm, Shelley Fruin and Katrina Keenan for six, eight and five respectively, reaching 49/3. Debbie Hockley, New Zealand's opener, scored 79 (48%) of her team score, as New Zealand eventually reached 164 all out from 49.3 overs. Hockley was one of only three New Zealand players to score in double figures, captain Lewis and wicket-keeper Rebecca Rolls scoring 10 and 18 respectively.\nAustralia bowled well, Bronwyn Calver, Karen Rolton and Charmaine Mason taking two wickets each, with Cathryn Fitzpatrick taking 1/22 off ten overs, including that of Hockley's wicket. Australia were set 165 runs to win, and began solidly, reaching 107/2 with Belinda Clark reaching 52 before being caught and bowled by Catherine Campbell. Knocks of 37 from Michelle Goszko and Karen Rolton's 24 enabled Australia to reach 165/5 from 47.4 overs, three minutes quicker than the New Zealand innings of 176 minutes. The New Zealand bowlers shared two wickets each between Keenan and Kathryn Ramel, with the former the most economical, taking 2/23 at 2.30 an over, however they could not prevent Australia's victory."

        "title": "Gumley Cricket Club",
        "text": "Gumley Cricket Club is an amateur cricket club based in Gumley, Leicestershire, England. The club has three senior teams. The Saturday XI, having traditionally played friendlies, started playing competitive cricket in 2009, in the Northamptonshire Cricket League. A Sunday XI side plays friendly fixtures against an established selection of clubs in and around the region. A Midweek XI compete in the Market Harborough District Midweek Evening League and Knockout competitions.\nGumley Top.\nGumley is a small village in South East Leicestershire, 4 miles north west of Market Harborough. Gumley cricket field is situated in the middle of the scheduled remains of the Gumley medieval settlement on the North West edge of the village, on a picturesque position along the gated road to Laughton. The field has extensive views of the valley looking South from the pavilion, and is characterised by the road which bisects a small portion of the outfield between the square and the pavilion. Motorists are relatively few on this particular stretch, but those that do arrive during a game are politely asked by way of a sign to wait until the end of the over.\nHistory.\nThere's a long history of cricket in Gumley, with reference to matches as early as the mid 19th century. One account, reported in the \"Leicester Chronicle\" in 1873 recorded a match between Kibworth and Gumley regressing into a brawl between the two teams, fueled in part by the presence of alcohol. However, facilities and decorum have improved markedly over the years. A concerted effort by several club members have raised the quality of the square and fund raising efforts have yielded many improvements to the pavilion, in particular a much needed new roof.\nTouring.\nThe club arranges an annual tour of 4 matches on consecutive days from the Thursday after the late May Bank Holiday. Past venues include: Margate, Braintree, Barnstaple, Havant, Harrogate, etc. The tour has been a regular feature of the club calendar since 2000.\nPerformance.\nThe Leicestershire &amp; Rutland Cricket League competition results showing the club's position (by Division) since 2017.\nThe Northamptonshire Cricket League competition results showing the club's position (by Division) since 2008.\nCaptains.\nThe club appoints a separate Captain for each of its three teams. Captain since 1977 are as follows:\nSaturday XI\nSunday XI\nMidweek XI\nOfficials.\nSince 1977 are as follows:\nSecretary\nTreasurer\nFixture Secretary\nAwards.\nPerformance prizes awarded at the end of each season since 2000 are as follows:\nBest Batsman \nBest Bowler\nBest Fielder\nBest Young Player\nBest League Batsman \nBest League Bowler\nBest Midweek Player\nMerit Award\nRegular events.\nThe club runs a range of events throughout the year. On the cricket side, the intra-club Twenty20 day has proved very popular. The last game of each season is the keenly fought Club Match. This has traditionally been a Saturday vs Sunday affair, but with the better players gravitating to the League side, a new format was introduced in 2009 of 'Greys' (being over 35) vs 'Kids'. A recent addition to the calendar is Presidents Day. This is seen as an opportunity to say 'thank you' to our benefactors and features the Sunday team taking on a Select XI.\nAway from cricket, a variety of social and fund-raising events are held throughout the year, ranging from golf days to millionaires evenings and race nights. The club arranges a fireworks display each Guy Fawkes night, in conjunction with the local Scout troop. This event regularly attracts a very large audience from the surrounding villages.\nReferences.\n333"

        "title": "Equestrian facility",
        "text": "An equestrian facility is created and maintained for the purpose of accommodating, training or competing equids, especially horses. Based on their use, they may be known as a barn, stables, or riding hall and may include commercial operations described by terms such as a boarding stable, livery yard, or livery stable. Larger facilities may be called equestrian centers and co-located with complementary services such as a riding school, farriers, vets, tack shops, or equipment repair.\nHorse accommodation.\nHorses are often kept inside buildings known as barns or stables, which provide shelter for the animals. These buildings are normally subdivided to provide a separate stall or box for each horse, which prevents horses injuring each other, separates horses of different genders, allows for individual care regimens such as restricted or special feeding, and makes handling easier.\nThe design of stables can vary widely, based on climate, building materials, historical period, and cultural styles of architecture. A wide range of building materials can be used, including masonry (bricks or stone), wood, and steel. Stables can range widely in size, from a small building to house only one or two animals, to facilities used at agricultural shows or at race tracks, which can house hundreds of animals.\nTerminology relating to horse accommodation differs between American and British English, with additional regional variations of terms. The term \"stables\" to describe the overall building is used in most major variants of English, but in American English (AmE) the singular form \"stable\" is also used to describe a building. In British English (BrE), the singular term \"stable\" refers only to a box for a single horse, while in the USA the term \"box stall\" or \"stall\" describes such an individual enclosure.\nTypes of box.\nIn most stables, each horse is kept in a box or stall of its own. These are of two principal types:\nThe choice of type of box is likely to relate to the available space, local custom, welfare concerns, and workload of the horses. In some countries, local organisations give recommendations as to the minimum size of accommodation for a horse. For instance, in Britain, the British Horse Society recommends that horses be kept only in boxes which allow freedom of movement, and that these should measure a minimum of square for ponies, and square for horses. Common practice in the United States follows similar sizes. Stallions are sometimes kept in larger boxes, up to square, and mares about to foal or with foal at side are sometimes kept in a double-sized stall.\nMethod of operation.\nStables can be maintained privately for an owner's own horses or operated as a public business where a fee is charged for keeping other people's horses. In some places, stables are run as riding schools, where horses are kept for the purpose of providing lessons for people learning to ride or even as a livery stable (US) or hireling yard (UK), where horses are loaned out for activities in exchange for money.\nWhen operated as a business where owners bring their horses to be boarded, they are known as \"livery yards\" (BrE) or \"boarding stables\" (AmE and Australian English). There are a number of arrangements that horse owners can make with operators of these stables. The least expensive is when the horse owner does all of the work related to the care of the horse themselves, called \"do-it-yourself\" (DIY) or \"self-board\". In the middle range, the term \"full board\" is used in the US to refer to several options, depending on the part of the country, from a facility that simply feeds the animals and possibly provides turnout, to one that handles all care of the horse, sometimes including exercise under saddle but not training \"per se\". At the top end, the facility operator manages the entire care of the horse, including riding and training. In the UK, this is called \"full livery\". In the US, such settings may be called a \"training stable\". There are intermediate stages of care with parts of the care of the horse undertaken by each party, using terms such as \"part livery\" or \"part board\", with the terms not universal, even within individual countries, and usually agreed between owner and operator.\nSome stables also offer a service for horses to live on pasture only, without a space inside the stable buildings, known as \"grass livery\" (BrE), \"agistment\" (BrE), or \"pasture board\" (AmE).\nWhere the stables also house a riding school or hireling operation, some operators may also offer a \"working livery\" (UK) or \"partial lease\" (US), where the horse owner pays a discounted rate (or no money at all) for their own horse's care in return for the riding school being able to offer the horse to paying customers other than the owner.\nSchools, arenas and pens.\nHorses are often exercised under human control, ridden or competed within designated fenced or enclosed places, usually called schools, pens or arenas. These can be of almost any size, provided they are sufficiently large for a horse to move freely, and can be located indoors or outdoors.\nThe smallest are the round pen popular with natural horsemanship practitioners, which generally start at in diameter. Most arenas designed to allow more than one horse and rider pair to exercise safely at the same time are rectangular in shape and at the barest minimum are wide and at least long. The largest are commercial facilities designed for competitive events open to the general public with a performance space well over \nA riding academy or riding center is a school for instruction in equestrianism, or for hiring of horses for pleasure riding. Most feature a large indoor riding arena. At the time of the Napoleonic Wars large buildings were constructed for them, like Moscow Manege, Mikhailovsky and Konnogvardeisky maneges in St Petersburg.\nGrazing and open space.\nMany horses are turned out in to fields to graze, exercise, or exhibit other natural behaviours, either on their own or more usually as part of a herd, where they may also engage in play activity and social bonding.\nThe area where the horses are placed can be of any size, from a small pen with room to run, to wide areas covering thousands of square miles. In the United Kingdom this may range from open moorland without internal subdivision, down to small, fenced areas of grass, called pastures or paddocks in British English. A large turnout of several acres is a paddock in Australia, a pasture is significantly larger. In the United States, similar large spaces ranging from a few to many acres are called pastures or, for larger areas of public land or private unfenced ranch land approaching 100 acres or more, rangeland.\nWhere the purpose of turning the horses out is to encourage activity and not for forage, for instance where a horse is stabled for a large portion of the day, or where additional forage is not desired, they may be turned out in to areas with no grass, to encourage activity and prevent grazing. In the USA, such spaces are called a paddock or, in the western United States, a corral, in the British Isles, a paddock, and in Australia, a pen. Sometimes the colloquialism \"starvation\" is prefixed to these grassless areas, though the intent is not to starve the horse, but simply to regulate diet. This also could include a space such as a riding arena, doing double-duty as a turnout area. Equine nutritionists and management specialists also recommend a grassless area, which they sometimes call a \"sacrifice area,\" be fenced off from pastures intended for forage where horses can be placed when it is wet or muddy, to prevent the grass from being trampled, and during times of drought, to prevent or minimize overgrazing."

Edgar Davids scored the winning goal for the Netherlands in overtime; Davids, suffering a cramp, had asked to be substituted moments before but Guus Hiddink asked him to stay in the field. An apparent scuffle between Van der Sar and Winston Bogarde in the celebration was explained by Van der Sar as an instinctive overreaction from being unintentionally choked by Pierre van Hooijdonk.\n&lt;section begin=\"R of 16 6\"/&gt;&lt;section end=\"R of 16 6\"/&gt;\nRomania vs Croatia.\nCroatia's winning penalty goal had to be retaken.

Beckham's teammate Michael Owen subsequently described Beckham's act as \"childish and unnecessary\", although Owen also said that the burnings of effigies of Beckham were undeserved. In the subsequent penalty shoot-out, Argentina went first. David Seaman saved Argentina's second penalty from Hernán Crespo to give England the advantage, but that was immediately cancelled when Carlos Roa saved from Paul Ince.

Goalie Mike Federico, defenseman Mark Greenberg and midfielder Brendan Schneck repeated as first team choices, while Jeff Cook made the second team attack squad.\nVirginia was notable in this tournament for playing overtime games in all three of their contests, including the two overtime game against Hopkins in the finals. Hopkins players Wayne Davis and Ned Radebaugh were both sidelined in that game. Virginia took advantage at the face off with Cavs junior Steve Kraus winning 17 of his 20 faceoffs. The winning goal by Jeff Harris in the second overtime period gave Hopkins the first-ever third straight NCAA title a feat which would not be duplicated for 10 more years."

The lacrosse program at North Carolina State was discontinued shortly afterwards.\nThis was one of the great seasons in Hopkins' history, with highlights of the 13–0 season including wins over #2 Maryland and #5 Virginia (twice each) as well as wins over #3 Navy, #4 Cornell, North Carolina State, and #6 Army. Hopkins was ranked first in the nation for 11 straight weeks. The team averaged over 15 goals a game and gave up under 7 goals a game, with only two teams able to score double digits in goals against Hopkins.\nIn the finals, Johns Hopkins used one of the all-time best defenses led by Hall of Fame goalie Mike Federico and defenseman Mark Greenberg, as well as a strong offense led by Dave Huntley and Jeff Cook, to defeat the Terrapins for the second time that season. John Hopkins took control with five unanswered goals in the second period of the title game. Also, in the second quarter, Hopkins' defense held Maryland in check where the Terps did not get a shot on goal off for over 11 minutes. Hopkins had handed the Terrapins five of their losses over the prior three seasons, including consecutive defeats in the semifinals of the Division I tournaments in 1977 and 1978.\nThe top seed in the tournament went to the Blue Jays after a 10–0 regular season record. Johns Hopkins were winners of 17 in a row since a mid-season defeat in 1978 by Cornell. Hopkins went on to win 25 straight games through the 1980 season.\nSyracuse appeared for the first time in an NCAA tournament while Maryland made its ninth straight tournament appearance. Following this title game, Hopkins had won or tied for 34 national championships, more than twice as many as any other school.\nThis was a great stretch of tournament play for the Terrapins as during the 1970s, Maryland participated in six NCAA title games, including four in a row from 1973 to 1976. During that span, the Terps won two national titles and lost four."

This was the Blue Jays' second national title. Before this loss, Cornell had come into the game on a 42-game unbeaten streak and had not lost a game since May 24, 1975, a 15–12 setback to Navy in the 1975 NCAA tournament semifinals.\nThe championship game was hosted at Rutgers Stadium on the campus of Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. The game grew a crowd of 13,527 fans.\nOverview.\nTwelve NCAA Division I college men's lacrosse teams met after having played their way through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament.\nThe finals was a showdown of the #1 and #2 ranked teams, with Johns Hopkins lone loss coming on April 15 to Cornell (16–11) at Homewood Field in Baltimore. Up until this game, Hopkins had lost only three games in the prior two seasons, all losses to Cornell.\nBefore their finals loss, Cornell set the NCAA consecutive victories record of 42 games, not losing a game from March 20, 1976, to May 20, 1978. During this win streak, Cornell was 16-0 in 1976, 13-0 in 1977 and 13-1 in 1978. This was the first game since 1975 in which Cornell had been limited to less than 10 goals.\nMike O'Neill, attackman from Johns Hopkins, was later named the Division 1 National Player of the Year and was named the tournament outstanding player, finishing with one goal and three assists in the finals. Johns Hopkins would go on to win three straight national titles and appear in an unprecedented nine straight NCAA finals, from 1977 through 1985, finishing with five national titles against four losses during that stretch. Ned Radebaugh dominated at face off winning 20 of 22 draws, with Radebaugh's dominance contributing to the NCAA's decision for the 1979 season to eliminate faceoffs."

Scott retired as head coach following this game to become Athletic Director. All American Franz Wittlesberger scored five goals in the final. Hopkins' senior defenseman Bob Barbera scored the only goal of his career in the championship game. Hopkins built a lead of 14-6 in the 3rd quarter, and was able to hold off the Terps despite Frank Urso's 3 goals and 5 assists. Freshman Kevin Mahon finished with 21 saves for the day.\nThis tournament is also notable for the Johns Hopkins versus Washington and Lee semifinal game won by Hopkins in a close 11 to 10 matchup. Trailing 10 to 7 in the fourth quarter, Hopkins scored four straight goals, including the game winner with two minutes left, to overcome previously unbeaten Washington and Lee. Rich Kowalchuk scored on a feed from Tom Myrick for the game-winning goal with 1:50 to play in the fourth quarter. Hopkins outshot Washington and Lee 21 to 5 in the 4th quarter. With the game tied and 4 minutes left to play, Washington and Lee with the ball went into a stall, where a bad pass turned possession over to Hopkins and leading to the game winning goal.\nWashington and Lee, which finished the season 15-1, was coming off their second straight undefeated regular season and had defeated Navy twice, Princeton, Duke, North Carolina, and Virginia before losing to Hopkins. Jack Emmer, who had previously led Cortland State to a tournament appearance coached the Generals to six straight NCAA tournaments from 1973 to 1978.\nOutstanding players.\nThe NCAA did not designate a Most Outstanding Player until the 1977 national tournament."

The match was held at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on 29 June 1986 and had an attendance of 114,600. It was contested by Argentina and West Germany. Argentina won the match 3–2 in regulation time.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nJosé Luis Brown opened the scoring for Argentina in the 23rd minute with a header after an error of the German Keeper Harald Schumacher on a free-kick from the right and it stayed at 1–0 until half-time. 11 minutes into the second half, Jorge Valdano doubled Argentina's lead with a low side foot finish after cutting in from the left past the advancing goalkeeper. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge pulled a goal back in the 74th minute from close range for West Germany, his first goal in the tournament. West Germany then equalised in the 81st minute, with Rudi Völler scoring with a header from close range. Although Diego Maradona was heavily marked by Lothar Matthäus throughout the game, his pass to Jorge Burruchaga in the 84th minute allowed Argentina to regain the lead at 3–2 when he slid the ball past the advancing goalkeeper from the right and into the corner of the net. \nSix yellow cards were issued in this match, which was a record number until the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final. Two of them were issued because of timewasting from Argentine players. As the clock expired, Argentina celebrated their second World Cup victory in three tournaments after having won the 1978 World Cup on home soil.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules:\nAftermath.\nThe second World Cup won by Argentina is regarded by many as the most important victory for an Argentine side. Four years later, both teams met in the final of the 1990 World Cup, with West Germany winning. This marked the first time two World Cup finalists met twice, a record later shared with Brazil and Italy, the 1970 and 1994 World Cup finalists. Argentina and Germany met in the 2014 final for a record third time as finalists.\nWith the 1986 defeat, German manager Franz Beckenbauer gained the distinction of having lost a World Cup final as a player (in 1966) and a manager. In 1990 he managed Germany to victory, becoming a winner of the World Cup as player (in 1974) and as manager.\nArgentina would not see another world title for 36 years until their win over France in the 2022 final."

        "text": "Charles Elmer \"Doc\" Stewart (November 13, 1895 – January 23, 1973) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League between 1924 and 1927.\nPlaying career.\nStewart was born in Carleton Place, Ontario. After a junior career with the Kingston Collegiate Institute of the Ontario Hockey Association, Stewart starred in senior hockey for several teams in the OHA from 1914 to 1924, most notably for the Toronto Dentals for four seasons while undergoing medical training, being named to the league's Second All-Star Team in 1918 and the First All-Star Team in 1919. During that time, he enlisted in the Canadian Army Dental Corps in 1917, being commissioned as a lieutenant, and assigned to Battalion M. D. No. 2; he did not see overseas service before war's end.\nWith the Hamilton Tigers' OHA senior amateur team in 1922, 1923 and 1924, Stewart was named the First Team All-Star goaltender all three seasons.\nThe Boston Bruins began play in 1924 and losing eight of their first nine games, often by wide margins, and desperate for goaltending, signed Stewart to a contract. He played the rest of the schedule for Boston, winning five out of twenty-one games for the weak club, adding two shutouts. He remained the Bruins' goaltender for two more seasons, his best record coming in 1926, when he had a 16-14-4 record with six shutouts and a 2.21 goals against average.\nLate in the 1927 season, the Bruins loaned Stewart to the Hamilton Tigers of the Canadian-American Hockey League, with whom he played nine games to finish his hockey career.\nStewart finished his NHL career with a 30-41-5 record and ten shutouts in 77 games, recording a 2.45 goals against average. His career goals against average is fifth best in Boston Bruins' history for any goaltender playing 75 games or more.\nPersonal life.\nStewart's parents were Thomas H. and Bessie Allan Stewart. In 1926 he married Ida M. Dawson of Hamilton, Ontario.\nHis older brother was dentist and politician Harry Allan Stewart.\nHe graduated from the Royal College of Dental Surgeons in 1919, and practiced dentistry in the offseason thereafter."

        "text": "The basketball tournaments of National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) 84th season hosted by the Mapúa Institute of Technology began on June 28 at the Araneta Coliseum with Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chairman Bayani Fernando as the keynote speaker (however, Fernando was later tasked to lead the cleanup efforts caused by Typhoon Frank, he sent his daughter instead). All subsequent elimination round games will be held at Cuneta Astrodome. The theme of the season is \"To The Fore at 84\".\nThe games began on June 28 at the Araneta Coliseum, Quezon City with a quadruple-header.\nThe first two games along with men's games every Wednesday and Friday will be aired on Studio 23. The remaining elimination round games were at the Cuneta Astrodome at Pasay, except for the last game which was held at the Araneta Coliseum.\nThe San Beda Red Lions and the San Sebastian Staglets both defended their titles successfully, with the Red Lions winning against the JRU Heavy Bombers in three games and the Staglets sweeping the elimination round and their finals series against the Letran Squires. San Beda is now the three-time champion while San Sebastian won their fourth consecutive title.\nNew rules.\nThe NCAA Policy Board approved two new rule changes concerning the basketball events:\nMen's tournament.\nTeams.\nChanges from last season.\nReturning from suspension:\nPreseason.\nWith Caloy Garcia leaving the team and being elevated to the head coach position at Welcoat Dragons, Red Bull Barako assistant coach Gee Abanilla was tapped in as the new Benilde Blazers coach for the 84th season. Abanilla coached the Barakos for a few wins while head coach Yeng Guiao was away on the campaign trail at the 2007 election.\nElimination round.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;\nMatch-up results.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's match-up results\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's match-up results\" /&gt;\nPostseason teams.\nSan Beda Red Lions.\nThe defending champions opened the season with a 29-point blowout against season host Mapua; it seems another championship run by San Beda as they won 5 consecutive victories, including an overtime thriller against San Sebastian. However, CSB put their game against San Beda under protest as Sam Ekwe donned last year's uniform. The NCAA Management Committee ruled in favor of CSB, on the same day JRU used their outside shooting to shock San Beda giving them two losses in one day.\nThe Red Lions recovered with a win against their marquee game against Letran and PCU but Mapua gave their own version of an upset when they used slow ball against the Red Lions to win the game. San Beda recovered with wins against Perpetual, revenge against both CSB and JRU and another close game against San Sebastian. The Red Lions capped off the elimination round as the #1 seed by sending Letran to the classification round for 2nd-4th places after Borgie Hermida scored on a buzzer-beaten to make them win the game in overtime at the Araneta Coliseum.\nLetran Knights.\nLetran won the first six games of the season, including a come-from-behind win against UPHSD, but faltered in the first round finale against San Beda in which the ball slipped from Reymar Gutilban's hands to land at the end lines in the dying seconds. After a win against CSB, Letran lost the next two games against JRU and San Sebastian. After a win against also-ran UPHSD, Mapua whipped the Knights in the Battle of Intramuros despite not scoring a field-goal in the fourth quarter.\nContinuing the pattern, Letran beat PCU in their last NCAA game since they'll take a leave of absence. In the elimination round finale, Letran was on the verge of winning a twice-to-beat advantage but a game went into overtime. In the extra period, Letran was leading by 4 points when San Beda rallied to lead by two. RJ Jazul scored on a driving lay-up with 5 seconds remaining but Borgie Hermida scored a buzzer-beater with a looper from the free-throw line to seal San Beda's third straight semifinal appearance with the twice to beat advantage. Letran now had to go through a series of games to determine if they'll qualify for the Final Four.\nJRU Heavy Bombers.\nThe Bombers were blown out by Letran on opening day and were beaten by San Sebastian in the closing minutes in their second game. The Heavy Bombers regrouped and won their next eight games, including an upset against San Beda where they capitalized on their streaky three-point shooting. Ironically it was San Beda that finished the streak when they had a decisive run in the fourth quarter to prevent a JRU comeback.\nSan Sebastian continued their mastery of the Bombers with another win against them. After a win against PCU, JRU had an outside chance of clinching a twice to beat advantage provided they beat Mapua which was on a must-win situation. The Cardinals were riding on a three-game winning streak and capitalized on the momentum to force three teams tied with 9-5 records; with the loss of Letran against San Beda, those four teams would undergo a series of games to determine which teams will clinch the nos. 2 to 4 seeds.\nMapua Cardinals.\nMapua was blown away by the Red Lions on opening day with a 29-point drubbing, but the Cardinals recovered by winning their next 3 games in a span of a week. After a win against CSB, Letran won the first Battle of Intramuros, and they were beaten by JRU and San Sebastian. Mapua dealt San Beda their only loss in the second round with a slow-down game in which they took a shot at the very end of the shot clock to throw off the Red Lions' fast-paced game, with Kelvin dela Peña proclaiming on the post-game interview that they're back.\nThe Cardinals were dealt with a disappointing loss against the also-ran CSB Blazers, and they had to win all of their games to force a tie for the last qualifying berth. With them winning all of their games, including the second Battle of Intramuros, and a do-or-die game against JRU in their last game of the eliminations, the Cardinals forced a four-way tie for #2.\nThe Cardinals became the only team to beat the Red Lions twice this season, with two consecutive win in the second round and the first game of their semifinals match-up.\nSan Sebastian Golden Stags.\nSan Sebastian lost its first two games against UPHSD and Mapua, but the Stags emerged victorious against JRU in their third game. After losing to the Red Lions, they didn't lose their faith in nothing more than joining the final four this season and \"reliving the glory days\" (their consecutive domination in the 90's) as they started their 8 winning streak against PCU and CSB at the end of the first round and extending their run in the second round as they beat PCU for the second time dethroning the Mapua Cardinals at the number 4 spot, revenge on both UPHSD and Letran and then defeating both JRU and CSB. They lost again to the San Beda Red Lions in a close match. Ending at 9-5 did not assure them of a final four seat even if they finished one match earlier than Mapúa, JRU and Letran as they lost against JRU and losing again to Mapúa in the Head-to-Head match for the final four. Even if the stags was granted the #2 seed in the face-off match, they were not able to enter the final four in the season 84.\nSan Sebastian were the only team to win against JRU Heavy Bombers in the Elimination Round. Sharing with the said team the highest winning streak of 8 matches.\nClassification games.\nAfter a tight race for the final four, it was announced that the Management Committee will meet to determine how to break the ties.\nAfter the games of September 5, it was decided that the system used by FIBA would be used to break ties and assign seedings.\nAfter San Beda's win against Letran, four teams were tied from 2nd to 5th, with only 4 teams advancing to the semifinals. The four teams were ranked on the basis of their head-to-head records.\nThe four teams will then undergo a mini-tournament to determine the 2nd, 3rd and 4th seeds. The winners of the first round will meet to decide the 2nd seed (a \"de facto\" best of three series) while the losers will meet to decide the 4th seed. The loser of that game will be eliminated from contention while the winner will face San Beda in the semifinals.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's playoffs\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's playoffs\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nSan Beda and JRU have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\n(1) San Beda vs. (4) Mapua.\nSan Beda and Mapua exchange leads until late in the 4th quarter in which Mapua led 51-38 when San Beda had a 13-2 run until the last 12.5 seconds. Ian Mazo turned the ball over for Mapua which led to San Beda taking a last crack at the basket; after the time out, Pong Escobal missed a hurried three-pointer and Mapua extended the series to a deciding second game.\nMapua would run out of gas in the second game as San Beda coach Frankie Lim observed that they were tired after an extended playoff run; although they gave the Red Lions a fight, a shot by Ogie Menor in the final 1:10 put the game out of reach for the Red Lions to clinch their finals berth.\n(2) JRU vs. (3) Letran.\nWith Letran up by three in the final 1:43, John Melegrito turned the ball over for a John Wilson lay-up. Mark Cagoco's defense caused RJ Jazul to turn the ball over anew, and James Sena scored in the next possession to put JRU up for good. Marvin Hayes helped in defending Jazul to force another turnover; Jazul fouled Cagoco to stop the clock. As Cagoco split his free throws, Jazul has a last chance to tie the game but Wilson blocked his shot as time expired, leading JRU to their first finals series since 2001.\nControversies.\nWrong uniform.\nSan Beda's Sam Ekwe wore a different uniform in San Beda's 71-54 victory against CSB; he instead wore the 2007 uniform. As a result, CSB filed a protest that could overturn San Beda's victory. The Management Committee reversed San Beda's win against CSB on a decision released on July 23, awarding CSB the victory.\nAwards.\nThe season's awardees were awarded at halftime of the first game of the finals series. They are:\nJuniors' tournament.\nGames began on June 30 at the Cuneta Astrodome at Pasay.\nElimination round.\nKeith Agovida of JRU broke the NCAA scoring record of 70 points held by Letran's Marlon Bola Bola; as he scored 82 points in JRU's 127-49 rout of Malayan Science.\nIt was the first time in NCAA history that the San Beda Red Cubs failed to enter the Final Four round and was also the first time that a team had swept the eliminations since 2000. The San Sebastian Staglets therefore advanced to the finals automatically.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=\"Juniors' standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Juniors' standings\" /&gt;\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Juniors' playoffs\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Juniors' playoffs\" /&gt;\nBroadcast notes.\nABS-CBN's UHF channel Studio 23 is the sole coverer of the games, covering all men's games since opening day held on a Wednesday and Friday (except for the last two games on opening day). 101.9 For Life!, ABS-CBN's FM radio station, delivers updates on game dates.\n\"NCAA College Hoops\" airs every Monday afternoons as a supplement for the main NCAA coverage.

        "text": "Kim Joo-sung (; born 9 November 1979) is a South Korean basketball coach and retired player. A forward-center, he spent his entire sixteen-year playing career with Wonju DB Promy. Since 2019 he has been a coach at Wonju DB Promy.\nEarly life.\nA native of Busan, Kim grew up in the district of Haeundae-gu. Kim only began focusing on basketball in high school, relatively late compared to many of his KBL peers. His younger sister Kim Hyang-ran is a former volleyball player. The siblings had a financially unstable upbringing as their childhood coincided with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which greatly affected South Korea, and both their parents had physical disabilities caused by polio and scoliosis.\nCollege career.\nKim played college basketball at Chung-Ang University and drew comparisons to Seo Jang-hoon for his height. During the 2000 National Basketball Festival tournament, he ranked first in rebounds and points scored and named the MVP. His stellar performances in other Korea University Basketball Federation tournaments earned him a call-up to the national team.\nPlaying career.\nWonju TG Xers / Wonju DB Promy.\nAfter college, Kim joined the Wonju TG Xers. He was the first overall pick of the 2002 KBL rookie draft. Kim had one of the best rookie recording averages with 17.04 points, 8.72 rebounds, 2.24 assists, and 2.07 blocks in the season. In addition, he helped the team win the championship keeping the goal in the post-season of the 2002-2003 league. Kim averaged 18.85 points, 8.85 rebounds, and 2.43 shoot-blocks and won the Most Valuable Player of the league in the 2003–2004 season. However, the Xers failed to win the championship of 2003–2004, losing to Jeonju KCC Egis. In spite of the team's loss, The Xers won the championship in the 2004–2005 season, and Kim won the Most Valuable Player of the post-season for the first time.\nThe Xers was taken over by Dongbu Group, was reorganized to Wonju Dongbu Promy, later shortened to Wonju DB Promy due to the company's rebranding. Though the Promy took third place, they failed in the playoff, losing to Daegu Orions. The next year, Kim was injured and could not participate. Therefore, Promy ranked eighth in the league and did not qualify for the play-offs.\nIn the 2007–2008 season, his team won the championship by defeating Seoul Samsung Thunders. Kim won the KBL Most Valuable Player Award for the second time and led the league in blocks that season.\nDuring the 2011–12 season, Kim was a key player in Dongbu's defensive prowess, which led to the team earning the nickname \"Dongbu Mountain Fortress\". Along with center Rod Benson (206 meters) and forward Yoon Ho-young (197 meters), the trio were dubbed the \"Triple Posts of the Dongbu Mountain Fortress\" by the press after shutting down some of the league's best offensive players. Kim went on to win the KBL Defensive Player of the Year award while Yoon was named regular season MVP and Benson won the Foreign Player of the Year award.\nKim announced that he would be retiring after the 2017-18 season. Although he was mostly the sixth man, he played a crucial role in Promy finishing at the top of the league. He was nominated for the Defensive Player of the Year and won the Sixth Man Award at the annual KBL awards.\nKim is the first player to exceed 1000 blocks in the KBL, earning him the nickname \"Emperor of Blocks\" (블록슛 황제). He was ranked second, behind Seo Jang-hoon, for the all-time most number of rebounds in KBL history; Seo's record was eventually surpassed by Ra Gun-ah in January 2022. He was the league's highest-paid domestic player from 2004 to 2012. In December 2018, Wonju DB Promy announced that his number 32 jersey would be permanently retired, the club's second jersey to be retired after his former teammate Hur Jae.\nNational team.\nKim was first called up to the senior national team while in college. He won two gold medals at the Asian Games, the 2002 and 2014 editions.\nCoaching career.\nKim returned to his former team in 2019 as a member of the coaching staff. Since the 2020-21 season, he also oversees the club's D League reserve team.\nPersonal life.\nKim married Korean-American entrepreneur Park Ji-sun in 2008 after an eight-year courtship. They have two daughters.\nKim's sixteen-year playing career with Wonju DB Promy overlapped with that of Hur Jae and the latter's older son Heo Ung, who was drafted by Promy in 2014. It marked a rare instance in domestic basketball of a player being teammates with both a father-son duo for the same professional team."

        "text": "John Frederick Sanford (August 9, 1919 – March 15, 2011) was a Major League Baseball pitcher.\nSt. Louis Browns.\nSanford signed with the St. Louis Browns in . Despite having made three appearances with the Browns in , he was essentially a career minor leaguer with a 55–61 record and 3.74 earned run average in the Browns' farm system when his career was interrupted by service in World War II. He returned to the Browns in , and went 15–10 with a 2.74 ERA for the Toledo Mud Hens to earn a September call up to St. Louis. He pitched shutouts in his first two major league starts against the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox.\nHis success against the Yankees was fleeting, as he allowed successive home runs to Charlie Keller, Joe DiMaggio and Johnny Lindell during a relief appearance against the Yanks during the season. Still, he pitched well enough against them to catch the eye of Yankees General Manager George Weiss. At the Winter meetings, he and Roy Partee were dealt to the Yankees for Red Embree, Sherm Lollar and Dick Starr plus $100,000.\nNew York Yankees.\nHaving pitched 227 innings and appeared in 42 games with the Browns in 1948, Sanford's role with the Yankees was far more limited, as he pitched just 95.1 innings for the \"Bronx Bombers\" in . Still, he proved to be a very important piece for the Yankees down the stretch, as he went 3–0 with a 2.31 ERA in the month of September to help hold off the surging Boston Red Sox, and win the American League by a game. Sanford did not make an appearance in the 1949 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers.\nSanford's name came up in trade rumors early in the season, as the Yankees were in need of left-handed pitching. He responded to these rumors by getting off to a 4–0 start; shortly after which, the Yankees acquired left hander Joe Ostrowski from the Browns without departing with Sanford. From that point forward, Sanford's record fell to 1–4 with a 5.40 ERA. Having been a starter in the early part of the season, Sanford was demoted to the bullpen in June, making just one spot start in August. The Yankees returned to the World Series in , however, Sanford was once again kept out of all four games with the Philadelphia Phillies. The Yankees won the World Series both seasons Sanford was with the club, but he did not make a postseason appearance.\nFinal season.\nAt the trade deadline, he, Tom Ferrick and Bob Porterfield were traded to the Washington Senators for Bob Kuzava. Unhappy with the Yankees, Sanford was exceptional in his first start with his new club, retiring fourteen batters in a row at one point to earn the win. He went 1–3 with a 7.89 ERA in his next six starts, and was traded back to the St. Louis Browns. This time he was traded for fellow right hander Dick Starr even up. He went 2–4 with a 10.21 ERA for the last place club that lost 102 games that season. He spent two seasons with the Portland Beavers after his major league career ended, going 24–20 with a 3.62 ERA.\nCareer stats.\nPerhaps Sanford's most outstanding ability was his fielding; in 1948 he committed only four errors in 42 games (second best in the league). In 1950 and 1951 he committed no errors at all, and in 1950 he was second among pitchers in range factor per nine innings. His career ERA+ was 94, meaning he was approximately six percent worse than average in allowing earned runs relative to his era, stadiums, and league. He led the league with 21 losses in 1948, however, he \"ate up innings\" for the lowly Browns. He was fourth in the league with 33 starts and seventh in innings pitched. His only career home run came off the Cleveland Indians' Bob Lemon on July 9, 1948."

His tee shot at the 16th hole was pushed and found the water hazard, and he made bogey. On the par-3 17th, Reid stayed dry but misplayed a greenside chip shot from thick rough, then three-putted for double bogey and lost the lead. He had a birdie putt on the final hole to force a playoff, but did not convert. Stewart was five-under on the final nine and birdied four of the final five holes.\nFour months earlier at the Masters, Reid led with five holes to play, but finished sixth after finding water at the 15th hole.\nIn search of a PGA Championship victory to complete a career grand slam, both Tom Watson and Arnold Palmer were on the first page of the leaderboard after the first round, with 67 and 68, respectively. Watson, 39, tied for ninth at 281 (−7) while Palmer, 59, was well back at 293 (+5). It was the final time that Palmer made the cut at the PGA Championship, though he played in the next five.

        "text": "The 2008–09 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team represented the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The head coach was Roy Williams. The team played its home games in the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and was a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. The team won the 2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the fifth NCAA national title in school history. Considered one of the greatest teams in college basketball history, the Tar Heels won their six NCAA tournament games by double digits, and by an average of 19.8 points per game. They were ranked as the 30th best team in college basketball history by Bleacher Report in 2012.\nPreseason.\nThe Tar Heels were a trendy pick to win the National Championship that year, primarily because Wayne Ellington, Danny Green and Ty Lawson decided to withdraw from the 2008 NBA draft, and consensus national Player of the Year Tyler Hansbrough never declared for that draft. In addition, the players had been embarrassed in the previous season's Final Four by Kansas, and they were motivated to atone for that poor performance. In the preseason ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll the Tar Heels were ranked #1. They were the first unanimous preseason #1 ranking in the history of the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll. UNC also received the first unanimous preseason #1 ranking in the history of the Associated Press Poll.\nSchedule.\nThe Tar Heels rolled through the nonconference schedule, along the way winning the Maui Invitational for the third time. They sputtered out of the gate to start ACC play, dropping their first two conference games to Boston College and Wake Forest. However, they recovered to reel off 10 straight conference wins, including a 101–87 thrashing of rival Duke. Their only relatively close games during this stretch came against the ACC's two Florida teams—most notably against Florida State, in which they escaped with a Ty Lawson buzzer-beater.\nThey lost to Maryland in overtime, but recovered to win their last three games. A win over Virginia Tech gave the Tar Heels at least a share of their 27th regular season title (which are not recognized by the ACC as official championships; the tournament winner is declared champion), and third in a row. They won the title outright with a season-ending win over Duke.\nThe ACC tournament did not go nearly as well, largely because Ty Lawson was sidelined with an injured big toe. They needed a last-minute score to defeat Virginia Tech, then fell to Florida State in the second round. Still, the Tar Heels were rewarded with the #2 ranking in the final AP Poll, behind Louisville. They also finished third in the final regular-season Coaches Poll, behind Louisville and Memphis.\nDespite not making it to the ACC title game, the Tar Heels received the top seed in the NCAA South Region. It was the 13th time the Tar Heels had been selected as a #1 seed—the most since the NCAA began seeding the tournament field in 1979. It is also UNC's 41st NCAA appearance—tied with UCLA for the second-most in history.\nThe Tar Heels played their first- and second-round games at the Greensboro Coliseum, just an hour west of Chapel Hill. They easily dispatched Radford and LSU to advance to the regionals at the FedExForum in Memphis. In the regional round, the Heels dismantled Gonzaga 93–77. In the regional final, they defeated Oklahoma 72–60 to advance to the Final Four for the 18th time in school history—tied with UCLA for the most ever. The wins in the regional phase were also the school's 100th and 101st wins in the NCAA Tournament, passing Kentucky for most all-time, although Kentucky has reclaimed the top spot as of 2019.\nThe Tar Heels were the highest seed to reach the Final Four at Ford Field in Detroit; they were the overall #3 seed in the tournament behind Louisville and Pittsburgh. In the national semifinal, the Tar Heels pounded Villanova 83–69 to advance to the national championship game for the ninth time in school history. They played against Michigan State, whom the Tar Heels defeated 98–63 during the December 2008 ACC-Big Ten Challenge. They were no less dominant in the title game, winning 89–72 for the school's fifth NCAA national title—tied for the third-most all-time. The win capped off one of the most dominant runs in the tournament's history. The Tar Heels won every game by at least 12 points—a feat all the more remarkable since they upended four teams ranked in the top 15 of the final AP Poll in the process (#10 Gonzaga, #7 Oklahoma, #11 Villanova and #8 Michigan State). They also led for all but 10 minutes of a possible 240 minutes of game time. It also allowed Tyler Hansbrough and his fellow seniors to end their careers as the winningest class in school history.\nWayne Ellington was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, the fourth Tar Heel to earn the award.\n!colspan=12 style=|Exhibition games\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament"

The International Ice Hockey Federation allowed for an unlimited number of entrants, after rejecting a proposal to limit the event to eight teams.\nIn the initial round, the ten teams participating were divided into three groups: two groups of three and one of four. In the second round, the top two teams in each group advanced to the medal round (for positions 1 through 6) with the remaining four teams advancing to the consolation round for places 7 through 10.\nCzechoslovakia overcame tragedy to win their second world championship and ninth European Championship. In November 1948 six Czechoslovak players (Ladislav Troják, Karel Stibor, Zdeněk Jarkovský, Vilibald Šťovík, Miloslav Pokorný and defenseman Zdeněk Švarc) were lost when their plane went missing crossing the English Channel. Despite the key losses to their roster, they defeated the Sudbury Wolves, Canada's representative, three to two. It was only the third defeat for the Canadians at a World Championship. The Americans were able to top the Czechoslovaks in the final round, which earned them a bronze medal, and kept the host Swedes off the podium.\nWorld Ice Hockey Championship (in Stockholm, Sweden).\nFirst round.\nGroup A.\nStandings\nGroup B.\nStandings\nGroup C.\nStandings\nConsolation Round – places 7 to 10.\nStandings\nFinal Round – places 1 to 6.\nStandings\nFinal rankings – World Championships.\nWorld Championships 1949\n Czechoslovakia"

        "text": "Paul Hogan (born 30 August 1963) is an English professional darts player who plays in events of the World Darts Federation. He is nicknamed \"Crocodile Dundee\" after the film starring his namesake, Australian actor Paul Hogan.\nCareer.\nHogan made his World Championship debut in 1995, reaching the quarter-finals. He beat Per Skau and Sean Palfrey before losing to Richie Burnett who went on to win the tournament. He returned the next year but couldn't repeat his performance of twelve months earlier, losing in the first round to Matt Clark. He failed to qualify for 1997 and 98 but did so for the 1999 World Championship, but again lost in the first round to Colin Monk. It wouldn't be until 2004 where Hogan would return to the Lakeside, beating Bob Taylor in the first round but lost in the second round to then-reigning World Champion Raymond van Barneveld. In 2006, he equalled his best performance at the Lakeside with a quarter-final place. He beat Dutchmen Mareno Michels and Albertino Essers in the first two rounds before losing to another Dutchman Jelle Klaasen who, like Burnett 11 years earlier, was the eventual champion. Hogan returned in 2007, but lost in the first round to Shaun Greatbatch. Hogan subsequently failed to qualify for several years afterwards.\nHogan has also reached the last 32 stage of the Winmau World Masters on three occasions, in 1989, 1998 , 2003 and 2014. Hogan also played in the UK Open in 2003, losing in the second round to Terry Jenkins.\n2005 saw Hogan claim his maiden Open Tournament, winning the British Classic, gaining wins over John Walton, Steve Farmer, Mike Veitch, and Jamie Caven before beating Gary Anderson in the final.\nHogan was less prolific in the years that followed, but he caused a surprise by coming through the qualifiers for the 2014 BDO World Darts Championship, his first qualification for the Lakeside tournament in seven years. He won his preliminary game against Karel Sedláček before being defeated 3–2 by Scott Mitchell despite hitting finishes of 161, 141, and 90 on the bullseye when Mitchell first threw for the match. Hogan followed up this success with a strong showing at the 2014 UK Open, notably beating three-time world champion John Part 5–0 in the opening session and following it up with a 9–3 win over Benito van de Pas to become the first player to reach the fourth round.\nPaul Hogan qualified for the 2015 UK Open for which he had another good run defeating Lee Russell, Derek Bland, Darren Johnson and Benito van de Pas before losing to World Number 1 Michael van Gerwen in a high quality affair 9–4.\nHogan has since competed on the PDC Challenge Tour Circuit. He recently won the Benidorm Open.\nHogan returned to prominence at the 2017 BDO World Darts Championship when he beat Martin Phillips to face world number one Glen Durrant and almost caused a huge upset. Hogan won 11 of the first 13 legs of the match to lead 3–0 in sets and 2–0 in legs. Needing one leg to win and with 16 points required, Hogan hit double-16 to bust his score and Durrant made a sensational comeback to win 4–3. Durrant went on to win the title.\nHogan rebounded by once again qualifying for the UK Open at Minehead, where he defeated Keegan Brown and Jamie Lewis in the opening two rounds, before upsetting back-to-back two-time world champions Gary Anderson and Adrian Lewis to reach the last 16. He was beaten by eventual runner-up Gerwyn Price.\nOver the weekend of the 25 and 26 March Hogan represented England in the BDO British Internationals. On Saturday 25th, Paul Hogan defeated Martin Phillips of Wales 4–3 in legs with a 30.10 1-dart average (90.30 3-dart) as part of a 12–0 whitewash for England over their Welsh counterparts. On the 26th England defeated Scotland 10–2 to win the title, Hogan's 4–1 victory over Alan Soutar will be remembered for the 9-darter he threw in the 5th and final leg.\nHogan again qualified for the UK Open at Minehead. He beat Darren Brown, Paul Nicholson and Jeffrey de Zwaan before losing a close last 16 match against Gerwyn Price 10–9.\nPaul Hogan qualified for another World Championship in the 2019 BDO World Darts Championship, where he lost in first round. In the 2020 BDO World Darts Championship he made a third quarter-final in a third different decade only to lose to Jim Williams 5–1.\nCareer statistics.\n(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Prel.)

        "title": "Tyler Ennis (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Tyler Foster Ennis (born October 6, 1989) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey forward.\nHe was selected by the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the first round, 26th overall, in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft from the Medicine Hat Tigers of the major junior Western Hockey League (WHL). He played 700 games in the NHL for the Sabres, Toronto Maple Leafs, Minnesota Wild, Ottawa Senators and Edmonton Oilers. He also played for the SCL Tigers and SC Bern in Switzerland. Ennis retired on January 17, 2024 after suffering a neck injury on November 21, 2023.\nInternationally, Ennis represented Canada, winning gold medals at the 2009 IIHF World Junior Championships and the 2015 IIHF World Championship, where he scored the gold medal-winning goal. He also represented Canada at the 2022 Spengler Cup.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nEnnis began his major junior career in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Medicine Hat Tigers in 2005–06, recording 10 points in a 43-game rookie season. The following season, he became a key contributor to the Tigers' offence with a 26-goal, 50-point campaign. Ennis went on to add 12 points in 20 playoff games as the Tigers defeated the defending WHL champion Vancouver Giants in a seven-game Ed Chynoweth Cup final. The WHL title earned the Tigers a berth in the 2007 Memorial Cup, hosted by the runner-up Giants, whom they met in the tournament final once more, but lost by a 3–1 score. Ennis contributed a team-high four points in four games, fifth in tournament scoring.\nThe following season, in 2007–08, Ennis' NHL draft eligible year, he ascended to a team-leading 91 points, fourth in WHL scoring. That off-season, he was selected in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft 26th overall by the Buffalo Sabres. In 2008–09, his fourth season with the Tigers, Ennis was named WHL Player of the Week for the week ending February 22, 2009, after an eight-point performance in three games. Ennis followed up his player of the week honours with a six-goal performance on February 27, scoring all his team's goals in a 6–2 win against the Prince Albert Raiders. He was just one goal shy of tying the WHL record of seven goals in a game, held by five players.\nProfessional.\nBuffalo Sabres.\nEnnis made his NHL debut on November 14, 2009, against the Philadelphia Flyers. He scored his first NHL goal that game against Flyers' goaltender Ray Emery. Ennis spent most of the 2009–10 season with Buffalo's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Portland Pirates. He finished the campaign with 23 goals and 42 assists for 65 points; his 23 goals was tied for the AHL lead among rookies. At the end of the season, Ennis became the second straight Pirates player selected by the AHL's coaches, players and media to receive the Dudley \"Red\" Garrett Memorial Award as the top rookie in the AHL, following team mate Nathan Gerbe the year prior. After Buffalo centre Tim Connolly suffered an injury, Ennis was called up for the Sabres' final nine regular season games, ending the NHL regular season with nine points in ten games and earning a spot as a consistent starter in the Stanley Cup playoffs for the Sabres. He finished the playoffs with a team-best three assists and tied with Jason Pominville with a team-best four points.\nDuring the 2010–11 season, Ennis played all 82 games, registering 20 goals and 29 assists while the Sabres clinched the seventh spot in the Eastern Conference, securing a first-round matchup with the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2011 playoffs. Ennis played a key role during the series, scoring two goals and two assists, including the overtime game-winning goal on Michael Leighton in Game 5. The Sabres were eventually eliminated by the Flyers in Game 7. The following season, Ennis was placed on the injured reserve twice for a lingering ankle sprain that first occurred in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Ennis rejoined the Sabres after the 2012 NHL All-Star Game. At the time, the Sabres were ranked last in the Eastern Conference. In an attempt to shake things up in Buffalo, head coach Lindy Ruff moved Ennis from left wing to centre, his natural position, playing alongside Drew Stafford and rookie Marcus Foligno. Their line caught immediate chemistry leading the Sabres offensively, vying for a spot in the 2012 playoffs. The Sabres ultimately fell short in their quest for the playoffs, finishing ninth. Ennis finished the season with 15 goals and 19 assists in 48 games.\nThe following season, during the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Ennis (along with best friend Jared Spurgeon) signed to play for the SCL Tigers of the National League A (NLA) in Switzerland.\nOn June 23, 2014, as a restricted free agent, Ennis signed a five-year, $23 million contract extension with the Sabres. Ennis led the Sabres in goals during the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons with 21 and 20, respectively, but the team finished last in the league both seasons.\nEnnis missed most of the 2015–16 season with concussion symptoms as a result of two concussions, one from a hit by St. Louis Blues defenceman Robert Bortuzzo and another from a hit by Washington Capitals forward Alexander Ovechkin.\nMinnesota Wild.\nFollowing his eighth season with the Sabres in 2016–17, Ennis was traded (along with Marcus Foligno and a third-round pick in 2018) to the Minnesota Wild in exchange for Marco Scandella, Jason Pominville and a fourth-round pick in 2018 on June 30, 2017. In his first season with the Wild in 2017–18, Ennis struggled to find his footing within the organization. Used as a depth forward, Ennis scored 8 goals and 22 points in 73 games and was a frequent healthy scratch through the 2018 playoffs in the Wild's first-round defeat.\nToronto Maple Leafs.\nOn June 30, 2018, Ennis was bought-out from the remaining year of his initial five-year contract by the Wild, releasing him to free agency. On July 6, 2018, as a free agent, Ennis signed a one-year, $650,000 contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. On March 4, 2019, in the Maple Leafs' 6–2 win over the Calgary Flames, Ennis recorded his first career hat-trick.\nOttawa Senators and Edmonton Oilers.\nDespite expressing interest in re-signing with the Maple Leafs, Ennis signed a one-year, $800,000 contract with the Ottawa Senators on July 1, 2019. In the 2019–20 season, Ennis continued to rebound offensively with the Senators, contributing with 14 goals and 33 points through 61 games. With Ottawa out of playoff contention at the NHL trade deadline, Ennis was traded to his hometown club, the Edmonton Oilers, in exchange for a fifth-round 2021 NHL Entry Draft selection on February 24, 2020. Ennis re-signed with the Oilers in the off-season on a one-year deal but struggled during the 2020-2021 campaign. He was healthy scratched numerous times throughout the season and eventually cleared waivers on January 26, 2021. He suited up in two of Edmonton's four playoff games where the team were swept by the Winnipeg Jets. \nEnnis returned to the Ottawa Senators for the 2021–22 season after signing a one-year, $900,000 contract. He found success once again with the Senators and scored his second career hat-trick on January 25, 2022.\nSC Bern.\nAfter going unsigned through the NHL off-season, Ennis signed with SC Bern of the top tier Swiss league for the 2022–23 season. \nAdler Mannheim and retirement.\nEnnis signed a one-year contract with Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) on October 21, 2023. He played seven games for the team, totaling five assists, before suffering a neck injury against the SC Rapperswil-Jona Lakers on November 21. The injury led to his retirement on January 17, 2024.\nInternational play.\nDuring his fourth WHL season, Ennis was named to Team Canada for the 2009 World Junior Championships in Ottawa. He helped Canada to a fifth-straight gold medal, defeating Sweden in the final.\nEnnis played for Canada at the 2015 IIHF World Championship, where Canada won the gold medal for the first time since 2007 with a perfect 10–0 record; in the gold medal game, Ennis scored the winning goal in Canada's 6–1 win over Russia.\nPersonal life.\nEnnis and his childhood best friend and former Wild teammate Jared Spurgeon were born less than two months apart and grew up in the same Edmonton neighbourhood, playing on the same teams, often with their fathers coaching, and spending summers at the Spurgeon family's lake cabin."

In 2008, Ray received a lung transplant, soon after receiving a diagnosis of having three months to live without one. The likelihood of receiving a transplant had been rated poorly, due to his need, at 6'9, of receiving lungs from a person taller than 6'5. He died on December 26, 2023, at the age of 66."

Masters Rugby League started in Brisbane Australia (South East Queensland Masters Rugby League inc which is still played today) and New Zealand in 1992 and has since grown in popularity, spreading to Australia and more recently to the United Kingdom &amp; Canada \nRationale.\nThe Masters of Rugby League New Zealand states, \"Masters Rugby League is the game for a lifetime, for semi-retired players and officials\". The Masters derivative of rugby league aimed to extend the playing, and officiating, life of people.\nIn 2008, in the United Kingdom the Rugby Football League (RFL) noted that there were only 2,000 registered club players aged 30 or over. This illustrates how the physical nature of competitive rugby league lends itself to being a young person's sport.\nHistory.\nMasters Rugby League started in New Zealand in 1992. Masters Rugby League in New Zealand has seen a growth in the number of teams since then as clubs became more aware of this grade. SPARC's Push Play campaign, promoting the benefits of physical activity has also had an impact.\nMasters of Rugby League Australia Inc. was a spinoff from the International Masters Tournament that was held at the Western Weekender Stadium, home of St Mary's Rugby League Club in Sydney in October 2004. Malcolm Duncan and Graeme Killeen, both associated with the Penrith Junior League became the President and Secretary respectively. With assistance from St Marys Leagues, keen referees from Penrith and others, Masters Rugby League grew.\nMasters of Rugby League Australia Inc. was established as a non-profit sporting organisation, with objectives increase access to the game for eligible participants and to promote the playing of rugby league in an environment of sportsmanship and goodwill.\nEligibility.\nParticipants must be aged over 35 and have retired from competitive rugby.\nRule modifications.\nRugby league's \"Laws of the Game\" apply except for amendments made by the governing bodies. There are slight differences between those adopted in New Zealand and the United Kingdom and the rules operated in Australia but the general modifications are the same and aim to reduce the physicality of the game, with \"Rough and over vigorous play\" not being condoned, and to reduce the amount of running, for example the defence must only retreat 5 metres at the play-the-ball and there is no running from dummy half.\nMasters players are divided by age, this being signified through the use of different coloured shorts. Physical contact is restricted or removed in both attack and defence for individual players based on these colours. The younger players can tackle normally, if older players are involved in the tackle it may be completed by a two-handed hold or by a touch."

        "text": "Christopher Philip Eaton (born 27 November 1987) is a British retired tennis player. He reached his career-high singles ranking of World No. 317 in June 2009, and his career-high doubles ranking of World No. 147 in May 2011. Eaton is currently the assistant coach at Wake Forest University.\nIn February 2009, Eaton played what was then the longest tennis match in history, lasting 6 hours and 40 minutes, eventually beating James Ward 21–19 in the fifth set. This was a playoff match to decide the Davis Cup team, but it was not sanctioned by the ATP, so was not an official record, and it was later broken.\nEarly and personal life.\nHe learned to play tennis at Reed's School. He was nicknamed the \"Eaton Rifle\" due to his big serve.\nFrom age 8 to 16, he was coached by Justin Sherring.\nJunior career.\nEaton reached a career high of No. 97 in April 2005 at age 17. In his only singles main draw junior grand slam match, and his final match as a junior, he lost to Donald Young at Wimbledon in 2005, 1–6, 5–7.\nSenior career.\n2007.\nEaton's best results in 2007 were two Futures championships in doubles in Israel and Great Britain,\nand a singles semifinal appearance in Israel F4 in November, where he beat No. 839 Amir Hadad.\nHe finished 2007 ranked No. 656 in singles play.\n2008.\nEaton made little singles progress in the first 4 months of the year. However, he had much success in doubles,\nmaking the doubles finals of 5 Futures and winning two of them.\nIn June, he had a breakthrough singles win in the 2nd round of qualifying at Nottingham, beating his first top-100 opponent, No. 90 Guillermo García López, before losing to No. 111 Vince Spadea in the final qualifying round. He followed that up the next week as a wild card by qualifying in singles for the Wimbledon Championships, beating No. 140 Mikhail Kukushkin, No. 206 Jan Minář, and No. 162 Olivier Patience, scoring 32 aces in that match. He was also given a wild card into the main doubles draw with Alexander Slabinsky.\nIn the Wimbledon Championships first round he beat Serbia's Boris Pasanski 6–3 7–6(8–6) 6–4. He then faced Russia's Dmitry Tursunov, the number 25 seed in the second round on Court One, his first show-court appearance. However, he could not continue his winning streak and Eaton lost 6–7(2), 2–6, 4–6. As a result of his performance at Wimbledon, Eaton's ranking rose to a career high of 386. This made him eligible for Challenger events.\n2009.\nHaving played little more than a few Futures at the start of the year, Eaton was thrust into play-offs, between six British tennis hopefuls, designed by John Lloyd to help pick the two singles players to represent Great Britain in the Euro/Africa Zone Group I tie against Ukraine.\nEaton started well, defeating Alexander Slabinsky 6–4 6–4 2–6 7–6 (7–5). He then beat James Ward 6–3 6–2 6–7 (3–7) 2–6 21–19 in a gruelling match lasting six hours and 40 minutes, making it the longest match in history prior to the epic Isner-Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships. Lloyd had decided he had seen enough, and chose Eaton and Joshua Goodall as the two players to represent Britain alongside Colin Fleming and Ross Hutchins.\nEaton lost his first Davis Cup match 6–3, 3–6, 6–3, 6–4 to Ukrainian number 1 Sergiy Stakhovsky but managed to restore some pride to Team GB, who were on the verge of a whitewash before Eaton managed to beat Illya Marchenko 6–3, 4–6, 7–6 in the remaining dead rubber. Despite putting in one of the better performances by British players other than Andy Murray in the Davis Cup recently, Eaton didn't appear in the plans of captain John Lloyd for forthcoming fixtures.\n2010.\nAt Wimbledon Eaton and doubles partner Dominic Inglot defeated the defending champions Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić in the second round, to achieve his best Slam result with a third round appearance.\nEaton began playing touchtennis as a pastime against other former professional tennis players as well as current park players and rank amateurs. He has won one title and hosted a weekly tennis phone in show on the sports website.\nEaton played his last match in the 2012 Wimbledon qualifying second round. He joined the Wake Forest men's tennis staff as an assistant coach in the 2016–17 season.\nHe coaches doubles player Henri Kontinen."

Men's basketball was introduced at Northwestern in 1901. Since 2013, the team has been coached by Chris Collins. The Wildcats have advanced to the NCAA tournament three times, in 2017, 2023, and 2024 after being the only longstanding member of a Power Five conference to have never made the tournament. The Wildcats have won two Big Ten conference championships (1931 and 1933).\nHistory.\nAlthough Northwestern had great success in the early part of the 20th century, it has spent most of the time since World War II in the bottom half of the Big Ten. The Wildcats were retroactively selected as the 1930–31 national champion by both the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll, and have won only one other conference title, in 1933. It has only finished above fourth place twice since World War II, and did not have a winning record in conference play from 1968 until 2017. During that time, only the 2003–04 team even managed a .500 conference record. On March 1, 2017, the Wildcats won their 10th conference game (a 67–65 win over Michigan) to clinch their first winning Big Ten record in almost half a century. That season also saw the Wildcats make their first NCAA Tournament in school history, winning their first NCAA tournament game 68–66 against Vanderbilt. The Wildcats have also appeared in the National Invitation Tournament seven times (1983, 1994, 1999, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012).\nThe very first NCAA tournament championship was held at Northwestern in March 1939. Until making their first NCAA tournament in 2017, Northwestern had been one of five original NCAA Division I schools and the only school from a power conference to have never played an NCAA Tournament game. Northwestern won their first Tournament game, defeating Vanderbilt 68–66. The Wildcats lost in the Second Round to No. 1-seeded Gonzaga.\nIn 1998, two former players were charged and convicted for sports bribery, having been paid to shave points in games against three other Big Ten schools during the 1995 season.\nThe 2022–23 team finished in a tie for second place in the Big Ten regular season, which is their best finish in the conference since the 1958–59 season.\nCoaching history.\nSources:\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I tournament results.\nThe Wildcats have appeared in the NCAA tournament three times.

It was the second time for the event at Valhalla, which hosted four years earlier in 1996. Tiger Woods won his second straight PGA Championship and fifth major in a three-hole playoff over Bob May. Woods and May finished at 18 under par to set the PGA Championship record to par, later equaled by Woods in 2006. It was the first time since 1937 that a PGA Championship title was successfully defended, and the first as a stroke play event. Woods and May were five shots ahead of third-place finisher Thomas Bjørn.\nWoods' victory marked the first time since 1953 (Ben Hogan) that a player had won three major championships in the same calendar year; Woods won the U.S. Open and the British Open in the previous two months for three consecutive majors. He went on to win the Masters in April 2001 to complete the Tiger Slam of four consecutive majors.\nMay opened with an even-par 72 then shot 66 (−6) in each of the final three rounds; this was the only time he was in contention in a major championship.

        "title": "David Jones (rugby, born 1881)",
        "text": "David \"Tarw\" Jones (1881– 21 January 1933) (also known as Dai Jones) was a Welsh dual-code international rugby union and rugby league footballer. He was a member of the winning Welsh team who beat the 1905 touring All Blacks in a game considered one of the greatest in the history of rugby union. Jones is the only Welsh player to have been part of a team to have beaten the All Blacks in the union and league game and is the second dual-code international rugby player from the Northern Hemisphere.\nDavid Jones gained his nickname Tarw (Welsh for bull) from his imposing stature; standing at 6’1'’ and weighing almost 16 stone. A collier from Aberaman who later became a policeman before becoming a collier once more, he played club rugby as a forward for Treherbert RFC and then later Aberdare, before switching back to Treherbert. In his later life he was caught in a scandal which saw him banned from rugby union and forced his switch to rugby league.\nPersonal history.\nJones was born in Tynewydd, a small village in the Rhondda Valley in 1881, to Griffiths Jones and his wife Catherine. Jones was the middle child of five, and like his father before him, became a coal miner.\nJones later managed to find employment outside the tough world of mining, becoming a police officer. Reports exist during his period as an officer which help to explain his unconventional character, both on and off the pitch. One story is told that while serving as a police officer in Treherbert he became annoyed with an inspector, Jones reportedly removed his tunic, grabbed hold of the inspector and forcibly ejected him from the station. Another occasion saw him disciplined by the police force for selling raffle tickets while still on duty.\nAfter leaving professional rugby Jones became a publican and ran two pubs; the Eagle Hotel in Aberdare, and the Castle Hotel in Treherbert. He would later fight in World War I as a member of the Welsh Guards but was wounded badly at the Battle of the Somme, leaving injuries that affected his health throughout the rest of his life. In 1933 David Jones died in Aberdare, South Wales.\nRugby union career.\nJones was one of a line of players chosen from clubs in the South Wales valleys to bolster the Welsh forward pack. His first international game was at the age of 20 against England after impressing during a trial at Treherbert in 1901 and he would represent Wales on another twelve occasions. Jones was a powerful man with a heavy tackle and was used as an impact player; although recognised as a lock forward his international career saw him play in several positions including one game where he was given the number 8 shirt against Ireland in 1905. Jones was part of a very successful Welsh team and was part of two Triple Crown winning sides.\nThe greatest moment in Jones' international career came in 1905 when he was chosen to face 'The Original' All Blacks in the famous \"Match of the Century\" Test match. The All Blacks had already played 27 games without loss, defeating the best British county and club teams as well as the England, Scottish and Irish national teams. Wales were the present Triple Crown holders and undefeated in the last year and the game was built into a major contest by the press, some going as far as calling it \"The Game of the Century\". Although reported as limping earlier in the week, Jones played his part in a hard-fought game, and along with Arthur Harding followed a clear tactical game to give Wales a clear advantage. The All Blacks had proven incredibly strong in their previous games in their scrummage tactics, using seven men instead of the usual eight, but using a wedge formation to force their opponents back and then use the additional man to great advantage when the ball was eventually released. Harding had played the All Blacks earlier in the tour, when he faced them with county side Middlesex, and this insight may have explained the Welsh tactic. The Welsh also used a seven-man scrummage pack, but with Jones and Harding staying mobile behind the pack switching sides to prevent the wedge push. The Welsh would eventually win by the narrowest of margins, 3–0.\nFive days after facing New Zealand for Wales, Jones was selected to face the same touring side as part of the Glamorgan County team. The county team was poorly represented, as several players from the victorious Wales team had promised to play but eventually dropped out, until only Jones, Will Joseph and Jack Williams remained. The team played well, with some excellent play from Cardiff's Reggie Gibbs. Jones himself was at the centre of two excellent moves; winning a line out and then placing an overhead punt, which Billy Pullen failed to handle correctly at the try line; and his own charge to the line which was just brought short of a try. Glamorgan eventually lost three tries to nil.\nJones would play his last rugby union game for Wales against South Africa in 1906. As part of the Glamorgan County side, Jones had played very well in the team's narrow defeat by the South Africans; but in the international he looked tired and ragged, and his normal excellent scrummaging was poor. He retired from the field early, his Wales union career over at the age of just 25.\nInternational rugby union matches.\nWales\nRugby scandal.\nAfter Jones' international career he would find himself caught up in a scandal surrounding professionalism. Jones was thought to have returned to Treherbert after his weekly payment from Aberdare was cut from 10 to 5 shillings. An ex-secretary of Aberdare told the press that Jones had received payment from the club, which was against amateur union rules. In 1907, after an investigation from the Welsh Rugby Union, Jones was banned from playing rugby union for life.\nDual rugby code international.\nAfter being banned from playing under union rules, Jones joined professional league team Merthyr Tydfil RLFC, and made national representative appearances for Wales in rugby league. His appearance in the first ever full international played against a visiting southern hemisphere side – the New Year's Day 1908 Test against the All Golds at Aberdare saw him become Wales', and the Northern Hemisphere's second dual-code rugby international, just three years after fellow Rhondda player Jack Rhapps. Played on a near frozen pitch, the game was a close match, with Jones scoring a try just minutes before the final whistle, which gave Wales the victory. This result made Jones the first player to play in winning teams against New Zealand under both league and union codes. On 25 January, just over three weeks later, Jones faced the New Zealand All Golds again, this time representing the Great Britain team. Jones was the only representative from a Welsh club in the British team, with the game played at Headingley in Leeds. The British were victorious, 14–6, and Jones was reselected for the second test against the New Zealand team on 8 February. Great Britain lost the second test, and Jones was not a part of the British team for the third and final test.\nJones finished his international rugby league career just a few months later when he represented Wales for a second and final time in a 35–18 win over England."

        "text": "Cricket is the most popular summer sport in New Zealand, second only in total sporting popularity to rugby. New Zealand is one of the twelve countries that take part in Test match cricket.\nHistory.\nThe beginnings of cricket in New Zealand.\nThe Reverend Henry Williams provided history with the first report of a game of cricket in New Zealand when he wrote in his diary in December 1832 about boys in and around Paihia on Horotutu Beach playing cricket. In 1835, Charles Darwin and called into the Bay of Islands on its epic circumnavigation of the Earth and Darwin witnessed a game of cricket played by freed Māori slaves and the son of a missionary at Waimate North. Darwin in \"The Voyage of the Beagle\" wrote:\nseveral young men redeemed by the missionaires from slavery were employed on the farm. In the evening I saw a party of them at cricket.\nThe first recorded game of cricket in New Zealand took place in Wellington in December 1842. The \"Wellington Spectator\" reports a game on 28 December 1842 played by a \"Red\" team and a \"Blue\" team from the Wellington Club. The first fully recorded match was reported by the \"Examiner\" in Nelson between the Surveyors and Nelson in March 1844.\nThe first team to tour New Zealand was Parr's all England XI in 1863–64. Between 1864 and 1914, 22 foreign teams toured NZ. England sent 6 teams, Australia 15 and Fiji 1.\nFirst national team.\nOn 15–17 February 1894 the first team representing New Zealand played New South Wales at Lancaster Park in Christchurch. NSW won by 160 runs. New South Wales returned again in 1895–96 and NZ won the solitary game by 142 runs, its first victory. The New Zealand Cricket Council was formed towards the end of 1894.\nNew Zealand played its first two internationals (not Tests) in 1904–05 against a star-studded Australia team containing such players as Victor Trumper, Warwick Armstrong and Clem Hill. Rain saved NZ from a thrashing in the first match but not the second which NZ lost by an innings and 358 runs – currently the second largest defeat in NZ first-class cricket.\nInter-war period.\nIn 1927 NZ toured England. They played 26 first class matches, mostly against county sides. They managed to beat Worcestershire, Glamorgan, Somerset, and Derbyshire. On the strength of the performances on this tour NZ was granted Test status.\nIn 1929/30 the M.C.C toured NZ and played 4 Tests all of 3 days in duration. NZ lost its first Test match but drew the next 3. In the second Test Stewie Dempster and Jackie Mills put on 276 for the first wicket. This is still the highest partnership for New Zealand against England.\nNZ first played South Africa in 1931–32 but were unable to secure Test matches against any teams other than England before World War II ended all Test cricket for 7 years. NZ's first Test after the war was against Australia in 1945/46. This game was not considered a \"Test\" at the time but it was granted Test status retrospectively by the International Cricket Council in March 1948. The NZ players who appeared in this match probably did not appreciate this move by the ICC as NZ were dismissed for 42 and 54. The New Zealand Cricket Council's unwillingness to pay Australian players a decent allowance to tour NZ ensured that this was the only Test Australia played against NZ between 1929 and 1972.\nCricket after World War II.\nIn 1949 NZ sent one of its best ever sides to England. It contained Bert Sutcliffe, Martin Donnelly, John R. Reid and Jack Cowie. However, 3-day Test matches ensured that all 4 Tests were drawn.\nNZ played its first matches against the West Indies in 1951–52, and Pakistan and India in 1955/56.\nIn 1954/55 NZ recorded the lowest ever innings total, 26 against England. The following season NZ achieved its first Test victory. The first 3 Tests of a 4 Test series were won easily by the West Indies but NZ won the fourth to notch up its first Test victory. It had taken them 45 matches and 26 years. In the next 20 years NZ won only 7 more Tests. For most of this period NZ lacked a class bowler to lead their attack although they had 2 excellent batsmen in Glenn Turner and Bert Sutcliffe and a great all-rounder in John R. Reid.\n1970–71 to 2000.\nIn 1973 Richard Hadlee debuted and the rate at which NZ won Tests picked up dramatically. Hadlee was one of the best pace bowlers of his generation and played 86 Tests for NZ before he retired in 1990. Of the 86 Tests that Hadlee played in New Zealand won 22 and lost 28. In 1977/78 NZ won its first Test against England, at the 48th attempt. Hadlee took 10 wickets in the match.\nDuring the 1980s NZ also had the services of one of its best ever batsman, Martin Crowe and a number of good players such as John Wright, Bruce Edgar, John F. Reid, Andrew Jones, Geoff Howarth, Jeremy Coney, Ian Smith, John Bracewell, Lance Cairns, Stephen Boock, and Ewen Chatfield, who were capable of playing the occasional match winning performance and consistently making a valuable contribution to a Test match.\nThe best example of NZ's two star players (R. Hadlee and M. Crowe) putting in match winning performances and other players making good contributions is NZ v Australia, 1985 at Brisbane. In Australia's first innings Hadlee took 9–52. In NZ's only innings, M Crowe scored 188 and John F. Reid 108. Edgar, Wright, Coney, Jeff Crowe, V. Brown, and Hadlee scored between 17 and 54*. In Australia's second innings, Hadlee took 6–71 and Chatfield 3–75. NZ won by an innings and 41 runs.\nOne-day cricket also gave NZ a chance to compete more regularly than Test cricket with the better sides in world cricket. In one-day cricket a batsman doesn't need to score centuries to win games for his side and bowlers don't need to bowl the opposition out. One-day games can be won by one batsman getting a 50, a few others getting 30s, bowlers bowling economically and everyone fielding well. These were requirements New Zealand players could consistently meet and thus developed a good one-day record against all sides.\nPerhaps New Zealand's most famous one-day match was the infamous \"Under arm\" match against Australia at the MCG in 1981. Requiring six runs to tie the match off the final ball, Australian captain Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor to \"bowl\" the ball underarm along the wicket to prevent the New Zealand batsman from hitting a six. The Australian umpires ruled the move as legal even though to this day many believe it was one of the most unsporting decisions made in cricket.\nWhen New Zealand next played in the tri-series in Australia in 1983, Lance Cairns became a cult hero for his one-day batting. In one match against Australia, he hit six sixes at the MCG, one of the world's largest grounds. Few fans remember that NZ lost this game by 149 runs. However, Lance's greatest contribution to NZ cricket was his son Chris Cairns.\nInto the 21st Century.\nChris Cairns made his debut one year before Hadlee retired in 1990. Cairns, one of New Zealand's best allrounders, led the 1990s bowling attack with Danny Morrison. Stephen Fleming, NZ's most prolific scorer, led the batting and the team into the 21st century. Nathan Astle and Craig McMillan also scored plenty of runs for New Zealand, but both retired earlier than expected.\nDaniel Vettori made his debut as an 18-year-old in 1997, and when he took over from Fleming as captain in 2007 he was regarded as the best spinning allrounder in world cricket. On 26 August 2009, Daniel Vettori became the eighth player and second left-arm bowler (after Chaminda Vaas) in history to take 300 wickets and score 3000 test runs, joining the illustrious club. Vettori decided to take an indefinite break from international short form cricket in 2011 but will continue to represent New Zealand in Test cricket.\nShane Bond played 17 Tests for NZ between 2001 and 2007 but missed far more through injury. When fit, he added a dimension to the NZ bowling attack that had been missing since Hadlee retired.\nThe rise of the financial power of the BCCI had an immense effect on NZ cricket and its players. The BCCI managed to convince other boards not to pick players who had joined the rival Twenty-20 Indian Cricket League. NZ Cricket lost the services of Shane Bond, Lou Vincent, Andre Adams, Hamish Marshall and Daryl Tuffey. The money to be made from Twenty-20 cricket in India may have also induced players, such as Craig McMillan and Scott Styris (from Test cricket) to retire earlier than they would have otherwise. After the demise of the Indian Cricket League, Bond and Tuffey again played for NZ.\nGoverning body.\nNew Zealand Cricket, formerly the New Zealand Cricket Board, is the governing body for professional cricket in New Zealand. Cricket is the most popular and highest profile summer sport in New Zealand.\nDomestic competitions.\nNew Zealand Cricket operates the New Zealand cricket team, organising Test tours, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 with other nations. It also organises domestic cricket in New Zealand, including the Plunket Shield (First-class), The Ford Trophy men's domestic one-day competition, the Hallyburton Johnstone Shield women's domestic one-day competition, as well as the Men's Super Smash and Women's Super Smash domestic Twenty20 competitions.\nMen's Teams.\nNew Zealand Cricket involves the following men's domestic teams:\nWomen's Teams.\nNew Zealand Cricket involves the following women's domestic teams:\nFirst World Cup.\nThe Cricket World Cup is an international cricket championship that is played every four years and is one of the most popular sporting events in the world.\nThe first Cricket World Cup was played in England in 1975 and consisted of a number of one-day matches of 60 overs each. In 1987, it was first held outside of England in India and Pakistan. Additionally, the number of overs per side was decreased to 50 for the 1987 match. Australia became the first team to win three straight World Cup competitions in 2007.\nGrounds.\nThere are numerous club grounds throughout New Zealand. Over 70 grounds have been used for First-class, List A and Twenty20 cricket matches.\nThe 16 grounds that have hosted men's international cricket games are listed in the table below.\nAs of 29 December 2021.\nNational team.\nMen's team.\nNew Zealand was the inaugural winner of the ICC World Test Championship title. New Zealand lifted the 'Mace' in 2021 defeating India by 8 wickets in the final played at Rose bowl cricket ground in Southam-pton. In the same year New Zealand ended up as the runner up of ICC World Twenty20 Cricket World Cup.\nHistorically, the national cricket team has not been as successful as the national rugby union team. New Zealand played its first test in 1930 but had to wait until 1956 to win its first test. The national team began to have more success in the 1970s and 1980s. New Zealand's most famous cricketer, the fast bowler Richard Hadlee who was the first bowler to take 400 wickets in test cricket, played in this era.\nAlthough traditionally New Zealand is one of the stronger sides in Cricket, they have only progressed past the semi-finals of the Cricket World Cup twice as runners up both in 2015 and 2019, but got caught short six times, the semi-finals of the Commonwealth Games and the semi-finals of the Pro20 World Championship, however they have won ICC Champions Trophy back in year 2000. Also New Zealand's Woman's Cricket Team has reached the World Cup finals.\nWomen's team.\nThe New Zealand women's cricket team played their first Test match in 1935, when they lost to England. Since then they have only won two Tests, once against Australia, and once against South Africa.\nTheir greatest success in one-day cricket was when they won the 2000 World Cup under captain Emily Drumm. In a hotly contested final, they scored 184 to narrowly beat Australia by four runs, Australia being all out for 180.\nCricket development.\nNew Zealand Cricket has established High Performance Cricket training centre based at Lincoln University. It also operates a grassroots development programme for school children called 'MILO Kiwi Cricket' . John Wright, former NZ opening batsman, was appointed acting high performance manager for NZC in November 2007.\nNew Zealand has many private cricket academies and the Bracewell Cricket Academy based at Rathkeale College is one of the largest cricket academies, providing an Overseas Cricket Development Programme, a Pre-Season Coaching Camp, a Festival of Cricket.\nThere are around 170,000 registered cricketers in New Zealand and is steadily increasing. By way of comparison, Australia has 1.3 million and the UK around 500,000.\nAccording to Mark O'Neill, New Zealand's batting coach from 2007 to 2009, the competition at club level in NZ is nowhere near as intense as in Australia.\n\"In Sydney there are 20 first grade teams, each club has five grades. To get to first grade you've got to be a friggin' good player and once you get there the competition is very, very fierce. Unfortunately it's not the same standard [in NZ]. Competition is everything and the only way the New Zealand guys are going to get that is to play the world's best players.\"\nFunding.\nNew Zealand Cricket derives most of its revenue from the sale of 2 types of broadcasting rights.\nHost nations pick up all the expenses of touring teams, but get sole access to all broadcast rights and gate receipts.\nIn November 2007 it was announced that NZC had made a 5-year deal for the broadcasting rights to home internationals for NZ$65.4m with Sony Entertainment Television. The previous four-year deal between NZC and ESPN-Star was for only NZ$14.4m. Part of the 5-fold increase in value is due to the Indian team's tour of NZ in 2009.\nImmediately prior to the 2009 Indian tour of NZ the \"Sunday Star-Times\" reported that \"NZ Cricket hits $25m jackpot\".\nThe article claimed that NZ Cricket will get $1 million for each of the 22 days the Indians take the field and that NZ Cricket had insured against loss of income for the sale of TV rights due to bad weather. NZC boss Justin Vaughan also said that a tour by India generates \"many times\" more income than tours by Australia, South Africa and England and that the Indian tour was worth more to NZC than the payout from the Cricket World Cup, which was around $20m.\nThe article also states that over the past two years, NZC's income has been around $30m, but this year (2009) Vaughan is hoping to get more than $40 million from broadcast rights, sponsorship and ticket sales.\nIn 2007, the ICC sold the rights to broadcast the World Cup, the Champions Trophy and the ICC World Twenty20 to ESPN Star Sports until 2015 for US$1 billion. NZC will receive a slice of that.\nIn November 2017, Star Sports acquired the broadcast and digital rights for New Zealand Cricket for all men's and women's international matches being organised in the country till April 2020 for the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.\nPlayer income.\nTwenty five per cent of NZC's revenue goes to pay player salaries.\nIn 2016 Kane Williamson, the top-ranked cricketer, earned NZ$205,266 as a basic retainer. This figure decreased in increments of $6000 and the 21st ranked player received $85,585. Kane Williamson also got a $40,000 captains fee. Players receive NZ$8,495 per test, NZ$3,682 per one-day international and NZ$2,407 for a Twenty20 international. On average, they play 10 tests, 25–30 one-day games and around 10 Twenty20 matches a year. There is also prize money for winning games.\nPlayers such as Williamson, Trent Boult and Tim Southee will play in virtually all of NZ's matches. So the top four or five players get between $300,000 and $400,000 from New Zealand Cricket, the next five or six between $180,000 and $300,000.\nAs a result of the new 5-year deal and IPL income, top NZ cricketers are earning more than the All Blacks.\nTop-tier NZRU players are paid around NZ$500,000 per year by the NZRU.\nIn 2009, Dan Carter, the most valuable New Zealand rugby player, was estimated to earn between $700,000 and $900,000 a year (including endorsements). McCullum, the highest paid cricketer, was estimated to be earning between $1 million and $1.5 million yearly, which included IPL payments. By 2014 and even more so by 2016, cricketers were dropping down the \"New Zealand Herald\" sporting rich list as Rugby players and other sportsmen and women got more lucrative overseas contracts. Several New Zealand cricketers came in places 11–20 with earnings of $NZ800,000 to $1.1m.\n\"Banned\" players.\nFormer Black Caps Nathan Astle, Chris Harris, Craig McMillan, Hamish Marshall, Lou Vincent and Daryl Tuffey who played in the \"rebel\" Indian Cricket League were effectively \"banned\" from ever playing for NZ again.\nJustin Vaughan former NZ Cricket CEO, perhaps with one eye on the legal ramifications, did not use the \"b\" word but preferred terms such as; \"the selectors will be encouraged to consider other players\", or \"overlooked for selection\". It also appeared that the players would not be able to hold a contract from their provinces but would be allowed to play on a game by game basis.\nIn January 2008 it was announced that Shane Bond had signed a US$800,000 a year contract to play for the ICL for 3 years. Bond's agent Leanne McGoldrick said that Bond intended to honour his contract with NZ cricket until May 2008. However, NZC decided to \"overlook Bond for selection\" because all members of the International Cricket Council had agreed not to pick players who have signed for the rebel leagues. NZC did not want to jeopardise its relationship with the ICC, as it relies heavily on them for funding.\nThis put Bond and NZC in a precarious position, as prior to signing his ICL contract, he had been given permission to play in the ICL by NZC (believing they were not contravening ICC rules) while still able to play in New Zealand international games. Bond chose not to press the issue, deciding to play solely in the ICL.\nIn September 1977, Tony Greig, Mike Procter and John Snow with support from Kerry Packer contested the bans they had been subjected to by the TCCB for playing in World Series Cricket in the English high court. The court ruled that the bans were a restraint of trade and therefore illegal.\nOn 29 January 2008, the \"New Zealand Herald\" stated that Bond, who wants to play in the upcoming series against England, and NZ Cricket was released from his NZC contract and will not be chosen on a game-by-game basis. Bond appears to have given up on legal action for restraint of trade.\nHeath Mills, the executive manager of the New Zealand Cricket Players Association (NZCPA), was not so conciliatory. He accused NZC of acting to appease the Indian board (BCCI). Mills described the ICC operating manual regulation that purports to not allow [ICC members] to release players to participate in non-sanctioned events as restraint of trade.\nMills also said :\n\"The NZCPA fully understands the position NZC has found itself and we do not want them to damage relationships with the BCCI and other ICC members. However, pressure to preserve these relationships should not be placed above preserving New Zealand's right to select its best players to represent the Black Caps, the rights and aspirations of New Zealand citizens to represent their country and the legal rights of players under their signed playing contracts.\nGiven the issues Bond has decided to stand aside from international cricket at NZC's request. The NZCPA supports this decision as it enables him to preserve a strong relationship with the board of NZC in the hope that he can again contribute to the game in New Zealand at some stage in the future. However, this is not a decision that he was compelled to make and under our contract system negotiated with NZC it remains open for any player to play for a third party like the ICL and still remain contracted to and play for NZC.\nIt is this situation that leaves the NZCPA concerned for cricket in New Zealand. We urge the ICC to step in and attempt to influence this situation and find a way to manage third party investment in our sport before we lose more players both here and around the world, and international cricket has been damaged further. History has shown that professional sports cannot afford to become split. It is absolutely vital that international cricket remains the pinnacle of the sport and that we ensure the best players are playing.\"\nIn any event, Bond himself has said that due to the risk of injury he no longer wants to play test cricket for NZ.\nDue to the financial problems as a result of the 2008 'credit crunch', the ICL cancelled part of its schedule, and offered to release the New Zealand players from their contracts, some of whom had not been paid for several months."

        "title": "Mark Robinson (rugby union, born 1974)",
        "text": "Mark Powell Robinson (born 17 January 1974 in Stratford, New Zealand) is a former New Zealand rugby union footballer. He played nine Test matches for the All Blacks between 2000 and 2002. Playing mainly at centre, Robinson played provincial rugby for Taranaki, Wellington and later Canterbury. In Super 12 rugby he played for the Crusaders, with whom he won two titles: in 2000 and 2002. It was while playing with the Crusaders that he played his only international rugby, two Tests in 2000 and seven in 2002.\nRobinson departed New Zealand to play for the Kobe Steelers in 2004, and in 2007 was named as the CEO of the Taranaki Rugby Football Union. He was appointed to the board of New Zealand Rugby in 2013, was elected to World Rugby's Executive Committee in 2014.\nOn 9 September 2019, Robinson was announced as the new Chief Executive of New Zealand Rugby, starting in January 2020.\nNot to be confused with the North Harbour and 1997-98-2001 All Black halfback of the same time, Mark Robinson was an intelligent and gifted midfield back who never reached his full potential for two major reasons.\nThe first was his university studies for these took him out of the country at a crucial period in his career. A post graduate student at England's Cambridge University, he earned not only honours degrees there in political studies and philosophy, but also appeared twice in the famous Varsity match against Oxford and was awarded two blues.\nThe second, and probably more compelling, reason for his career being a little unfulfilled was a wretched run with injuries. Because of these Robinson missed all of the 2001 NPC season for Canterbury and all of the Super 12 for the Crusaders in 2003, the latter break effectively ending his international career by ruling him out of consideration for the World Cup squad.\nFrom the same district in coastal Taranaki as another of New Zealand rugby's small band of intellectuals, Graham Mourie, Robinson also moved to Wellington to study at Victoria University. He had only a brief time in the Wellington representative side, making four appearances in the mid nineties. Most of his first class rugby in the 1994-96 seasons was with New Zealand Universities, for whom he played in eight matches including the world student games in South Africa in 1996.\nBecause of his Taranaki origins he also played in the 1994 farewell tribute match in New Plymouth to the retiring Kieran Crowley.\nHe returned to Taranaki for the 1997-98 seasons, impressing immensely with his strong running and reliable defence in Taranaki's surprise success in 1997 in making the NPC semifinals. In one match against Southland he scored five tries.\nAfter 18 matches for Taranaki, which was interspersed with his studies at Cambridge, Robinson linked up with Canterbury in time for the 1999 season and for the Crusaders in the 2000 Super 12.\nThough often affected by injuries Robinson was in the Crusaders which won the 2000 Super 12 title, a feat he and the team repeated in the 2002 season.\nIn 2000 Robinson received the first two of his All Blacks caps. He made his debut in the second test against Scotland at Eden Park scoring a try and played again in the tri-nations test against the Springboks in Christchurch.\nBecause of his injuries Robinson did not reappear in the All Blacks until the 2002 season. This proved to be his most effective season and as well as the All Blacks he played pretty much all of the year with the Crusaders, winning another Super 12 title, and also appearing regularly for Canterbury in the NPC and in Ranfurly Shield defences.\nIn the 2002 domestic season he was even preferred ahead of Tana Umaga for some of the internationals at centre. He played the warmup tests against Italy and Ireland and in tri-nations tests in Christchurch and Wellington against the Wallabies and the Springboks.\nHe had the last of his nine matches for the All Blacks, all of which were in tests, on the 2002 end of the year tour. He came on as a replacement in each of the internationals against England and Wales and was at second five eighths in the match against Wales.\nInjuries meant Robinson in 2003 did not add to the 23 Super 12 matches he had for the Crusaders but he recovered to take part in Canterbury's NPC and shield campaigns taking his appearances for the province to 25. But even though his career spanned almost nine seasons Robinson was still short of 100 first class matches in New Zealand rugby when at the end of the 2003 season he took up an overseas contract."

        "text": "Alexander Thomas Turnbull (December 6, 1863 or 1872 – August 27, 1956) was a Canadian lacrosse player who competed and won gold in the 1908 Summer Olympics.\nBiography.\nAlex Turnbull was born in Stratford, Ontario and died in Burnaby, British Columbia. For most of his career, \"Dad\" Turnbull gained his fame playing in the home (midfield) and outside home (attack) positions, although when he first started playing senior in Ontario, it was as a defensive player. He played his first senior matches in 1884 in Toronto. He bounced around teams in Toronto and Paris, Ontario, for six years before landing in Brockville in 1890. He played with Brockville and then Perth until 1894. In 1896 he found himself playing with and assortment of Toronto-based teams: the Elms, West Torontos, and then the Tecumsehs. In the fall of 1897, Turnbull moved to British Columbia—first to Rossland and then onwards to New Westminster where he would launch a 14-season career [spanning from 1897 to 1909, followed by a comeback in 1918] with the Salmonbellies. He played professional lacrosse for New Westminster Salmonbellies in 1909 and 1918, in which he scored 5 goals in 13 matches over those two seasons.\nTurnbull was regarded back in the day to be quite healthy for his age and a model athletic for his diet and regimen. Notable for the time, he never drank and very rarely smoked and he was praised in newspapers such as the \"Ottawa Citizen\" for his temperance and \"clean living\". He had to stop playing in 1909 after suffering two broken ribs during a game, but made a comeback in 1918 at age 46.\nIn later years, he employed as the warden at the provincial jail (a separate complex from BC Penitentiary). On April 3, 1911, he was shot in the leg while on the job when a guard's revolver accidentally exploded.\nIn 1965, he was inducted as a charter member to the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame. Two years later he was inducted into the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame.\nDiscrepancies with Turnbull's age.\n\"Dad\" Turnbull was almost always noted in contemporary newspapers of his day for his remarkable, advanced playing age, however there appears to be some discrepancies reconciling the birth year of 1872, which is the usual given year, with the start of his playing career in 1884.\nThe \"Montréal Gazette\" noted in a 1908 article that he was aged 44 at time of publication (on July 31, 1908) and he would be 45 as of September of that year, which would imply he was born in 1863. It also would imply a different birthdate from that of December 6. This 1863 birth year would however better correspond with his senior playing career beginning in 1884, because otherwise he would have been 12 (if born in 1872) when he started playing senior lacrosse.\nIn an \"Ottawa Citizen\" reprint of a \"Vancouver Daily Province\" article in 1917, his age at retirement in 1910 was quoted as being 42, which would then imply a birth year of 1868 thereabouts."

There were 54 participants in the competition, initiated by the Tallinn Rowing Club. In 1995, the second rowing ergometer competition took place in the sports facilities of Flora with the third event occurring at the same venue in 1996.\nThe competition was international for the first time in 1997 and the venue was then the Kalev gym at Tõnismägi. In 1998, the competition got the symbolic name ALFA and it took place in Pirita in the TOP tennis hall, and was repeated there in 1999. The 2000 Alfa competition was dedicated to the 125th anniversary of Estonian rowing. The venue, for the years 2000 as well s for 2001, was the Tallinn Sports Hall. In years 2002 and 2003, the competition took place in the Tallinn Kalev Sports Hall and since 2004, the International competitions on Concept2 rowing ergometers have been held again in Tallinn Sports Hall.\nBetween the years 1993–1997, the organizer of the competitions was the Tallinn Rowing Club and since 1998 the Tallinn Rowing Club in collaboration with the Estonian Rowing Association.\nOver the years the number of participants in the Alfa competition has grown from fifty to five hundred and thus is one of the biggest indoor sporting events in Estonia. Nowadays, the Alfa has become a fixed calendar event for the rowers. In addition to rowers, representatives of other sports, amateurs, politicians, firms, school children, the representatives of the defence forces and rescue services etc. participate actively in the competition.\nWinners.\n\" Bold marks competition record\""

        "title": "History of baseball in Portland, Oregon",
        "text": "Portland, Oregon, has been home to many baseball teams, dating back to the 19th century. Despite this, Portland has never fielded a Major League Baseball team.\nEarly Portland baseball: 1866–1883.\nThe first organized baseball team on record in the Pacific Northwest was founded in Portland, when on May 28, 1866, the Pioneer Baseball Club of East Portland was created. Known as a gentleman's group at the time, it composed merchants, doctors, lawyers and farmers from rural Portland. Professional players were not allowed to be part of the club. In fact, members had to pay dues in order to be a part of the club. Over the next year many clubs were created throughout the Portland area.\nThe Pioneers of East Portland invited clubs from throughout the region to a meeting in February 1868 to form what became The Oregon, Washington and Idaho Territories Association of Base Ball Players. The association consisted of five founding clubs—they were the Pioneers, the Portland Spartans, the Highland Baseball Club, the Clackamas Club of Oregon City and the Occidentals of Vancouver, Washington. The teams adopted rules that were slightly modified from those approved by the National Association of Base Ball Players in 1863.\nProfessional baseball in Portland: 1883–1901.\nIn 1884 Joe Buchtel, a player-manager for the Pioneers who is regarded as being largely responsible for making baseball popular in Oregon during the 20th century, started a new team in Portland, the Willamettes of East Portland. In 1890 this team became the Portland Webfeet. It helped organize the first professional league in the region, the Pacific Northwest League. This league consisted of teams from Portland, Seattle, Tacoma and Spokane, and began attracting players from around the nation.\nIn 1891 the Webfeet won the league championship, playing teams from as far as the California League, which included Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose. This version of the Pacific Northwest League folded in the second half of the 1892 season due to the onset of a nationwide economic depression known as the Panic of 1893.\nAn attempt was made in 1896 to restart the Pacific Northwest League, which was alternately known as the New Pacific League. Portland fielded a team in again in the league, this time going by the name of the Portland Gladiators. The season only lasted through June, but the Gladiators did end up winning the league championship with a 19–9 record.\nAnother new team gained notoriety in Portland in 1886, the Portland Monograms. Consisting largely of neighborhood kids from Central and North Central High Schools, this team was very successful. After defeating teams from Oregon, they went on to win against the Washington State Championship team from Tacoma, earning them the right to go to San Francisco to play the California Champions in a game called the Pacific Tournament. The Monograms played two games against the California Champions, tying the first 12–12 and losing the second 16–14.\nA new era in Portland baseball: 1901–1902.\nIn the spring of 1901 a new baseball park was constructed at NW Vaughn Street and NW 24th Avenue that would become known as Vaughn Street Park. This year also saw the second resurrection of the Pacific Northwest League. A group of area businessmen, spearheaded by William H. Lucas, also created the Portland Baseball Club and put together a team to play in the Pacific Northwest League, calling them the Webfooters. This team included Joe Tinker and won the League Championship in their first season.\nFollowing the creation of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues in 1901 (renamed Minor League Baseball in 1999), the PNL, and thus the Portland Webfoots, became a Class B league beginning in the 1902 season. In 1902 the team finished fourth in the league.\nOn December 10, 1902, Henry Harris, the owner of the California League's San Francisco team announced that the Pacific Northwest League team from Portland and a new team from Seattle were joining with the California League to create the Pacific Coast League.\nPacific Coast League: 1903–1917.\nThe Portland Baseball Club began play in the PCL in 1903, being known as the Portland Browns. Portland finished fifth in the league at the end of the 1903 season. In 1904 the Portland team, finished the season with a 74–136 record, setting a PCL record for the most losses in a season.\nThe Pacific Northwest League attempted to compete against the new Pacific Coast League in their inaugural year. Replacing the team they lost in Portland, as well as placing teams in Los Angeles and San Francisco, they renamed themselves the Pacific National League. The new team in Portland that year, the Green Gages, only played until July 1 when they moved to Salt Lake City, and changed their name to the Elders. Four other teams from the league stopped playing altogether before the end of the season, leaving only four teams in the league. By the end of the 1905, the old Pacific Northwest/National League was gone for good.\nThe PCL continued on though, as did the Portland Baseball Club. After the 1904 season, the PCL joined the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, thus making Portland a Class A league team (now called AAA Baseball). Also after the 1904 season, Portland outfielder Walter McCredie and his uncle Judge William McCredie purchased the team. The new owners changed the name of the team the Giants for the 1905 season, and Walter became the team's manager while continuing to play. As a result of a newspaper contest, the team was renamed the Beavers (Oregon is the \"Beaver State\") in time for the 1906 season. The newly named Portland Beavers won their first PCL pennant in 1906, finishing 19½ games over runner-up Seattle. Also in 1906 Beavers player Mike Mitchell led the league in home runs, setting a league record for the least home runs hit by a league leader, hitting it out only six times.\nThe Beavers finished last in 1907 and second in 1908 and 1909. In 1910 Portland won another pennant being led by the pitching of Vean Gregg and Gene Krapp. Gregg finished the season with a 32–18 record and 14 shutouts while Krapp had a 29–16 record for the season. Portland repeated at PCL champs in 1911 fielding four 20-game-winning pitchers. In 1912, Judge McCredie helped get a new 12,000-seat grandstand built at Vaughn Street Park. His obituary later read that the ballpark was \"the sensation of baseball, because it inaugurated a minor league precedent of providing individual grandstand seats, which fellow magnates called an extravagance and a dangerous innovation.\" The year 1912 also saw a small change in the classification of leagues from the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, as they made the top-tier league AA, which the PCL and the Portland Beavers moved into from the previous top tier Class A league.\nDuring the 1910s the Beavers developed some working relationships with other teams. From 1911 to 1914 the Portland Beavers had their own farm team who played in the Northwest League (renamed the Pacific Coast International League in 1918). The Class B team shared the use of Vaughn Street Park and was known as the Portland Pippins in 1911, but changed their name to the Portland Colts in 1912. During the 1914 season the Colts moved to the Seattle area and finished their last season as the Ballard Pippins before folding. Portland also had an informal relationship with the Cleveland Indians through much of the 1910s that saw many future major league stars come through Portland to fine tune their skills.\nIn 1913 and 1914 Portland played well, winning the pennant in both seasons. Though the 1915 Beavers featured Stan Coveleski, the team didn't fare too well, and started into a tailspin that would last for over a decade. The year also marked the end of their relationship with the Cleveland Indians. With America's entry into World War I, restrictions were placed on travel, such that the Beavers withdrew from the PCL for the 1918 season, playing instead in the Class B Pacific Coast International League. The team was known as the Portland Buckaroos and finished their shortened season (play was stopped on July 7 due to the war) in second place 1½ games back of Seattle. Ironically, the PCL ceased play just a week later as they too were unable to continue play due to the travel restrictions.\nDue to the Beaver's withdrawal from the PCL, the league offered Sacramento, California, a franchise to replace the Portland team, while the McCredie's continued to own the baseball club in Portland. The new team in Sacramento was known as the Sacramento Senators, and could be considered a continuation of the original Portland Baseball Club.\nReturn to the Pacific Coast League: 1919–1972.\nWith the McCredies still at the helm, Portland was offered the opportunity to become an expansion franchise and re-entered the PCL in 1919. The team finished in seventh place, only ahead of last place Seattle who was also an expansion team that year. Portland finished in last place in 1920 and again in 1921. After the 1921 season, the McCredies sold the team to Walter Klepper who had been president of the Seattle team. Klepper brought in Jim Thorpe who played with the Beavers for the 1922 season, paying him an unheard of minor league salary of $1000 per month. It wasn't long, though, before Klepper was in the middle of a dispute with Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Klepper had brought Seattle player-manager Bill Kenworthy down to manage the Beavers, but Seattle claimed Kenworthy was still under contract and that Klepper had tampered in the matter. Landis suspended Klepper until January 1, 1925, and declared Kenworthy ineligible to play or manage Portland until the 1924 season. According to the book \"The Portland Beavers\" by Kip Carlson and Paul Andresen, \"The feisty Klepper went to court and had the decision overturned, supposedly the only time that Landis ever had a ruling reversed.\" Kenworthy did manage the Beavers in 1924, replacing popular player-manager Jim Middleton. However, he was fired mid-season, as he was not able to generate support from the players. The 1924 season was also noteworthy in that Mickey Cochrane played on the team.\nAfter the 1924 season, the Beavers officially became a farm team for a major league team when Philadelphia Athletics owners John and Tom Shibe purchased the Beavers as well as Vaughn Street Park. Despite having Duffy Lewis on the team in 1925 (winning the PCL batting title), Elmer Smith in 1926 and 1927 (leading the PCL in home runs in 1926 and all of minor league baseball in home runs in 1927) and Ike Boone in 1928, the Beavers continued to finish in the bottom half of the league.\nLongtime head groundskeeper Rocky Benevento started working for the Beavers in 1927. Benevento was so popular with the fans that they took up a collection for him in 1956 to send him to the World Series. Benevento retired at the end of the 1966 season and was given a new car. When Benevento died in 1969, Portland newspaper \"The Oregonian\" stated, \"He adored kids...he loved baseball...and most of all he loved people.\" His funeral had an overflowing crowd that included Oregon Governor Tom McCall. Benevento's stayed with the team 40 years, spanning 30 managerial changes and five ownership changes. While the former location of Vaughn Street Park is now a parking lot, there is a plaque honoring Benevento for his efforts in furthering baseball in Portland.\nIn 1929 the Beavers changed their name to the Portland Ducks, bearing a duck on their uniform, and were also occasionally known as the Portland Rosebuds. The name change didn't change the team's luck, as they finished with a 90–112 record. Long time radio broadcaster Rollie Truitt also joined the team's staff, and worked for the team for 35 years, spanning 28 managerial changes and five ownership changes. Truitt would later be known as the \"Dean of Pacific Coast League broadcasters.\" In 1930 the team reverted to the Beavers name, but would occasionally be referred to as the Ducks for over decade. The highlight of the Beavers last-place 1930 season was William Rhiel's unassisted triple play, the last recorded in PCL history.\nIn 1931 team President Tom Turner bought the team from the Shibe brothers and the team took a turn for the positive. Ed Coleman led the PCL in hits and runs batted in, and the team finished in third winning 100 games. The team continued to improve in 1932, winning Portland its first pennant since 1914. The team finished second in 1933. Turner brought Walter McCredie back to manager the team in 1934, but he died early in the season and the team fell to the bottom half of the league.\nFollowing the 1934 season, E. J. Shefter bought the team from Turner. The team improved in 1935 finishing one game over .500, and then won the pennant in 1936, finishing but 1½ games over runner-up Oakland, then winning the postseason series to capture the crown. In 1937 the Beavers finished in fourth place, but made it to the playoffs defeating San Francisco in the first round before losing to the San Diego team featuring a young Ted Williams. The team finished sixth in 1938 before finishing in last place from 1939 to 1942. The 1940 team was so bad, finishing 56–122, that they were still 25 games behind the seventh place team (the league had eight teams at that time).\nIn 1943 William Klepper, with partner George Norgan buying a minority share, purchased the Beavers. The team came back that season with their first winning record since 1937. The management of the team began referring to the team as the \"Lucky Beavers\" and Vaugh Street Park was known as \"Lucky Beaver Stadium.\" With the United States firmly involved in World War II, local radio station KXL sold over $300,000 in war bonds in 1943 to fund the building of a bomber for the war that would be dubbed \"The Lucky Beaver\". At the time, the available pool of baseball players in the nation was ravaged. Somehow though, the Beavers still moved up in the league, finishing second in 1944. In 1945 the Beavers brought another pennant to Portland being skippered by player-manager Marv Owen. Despite winning the pennant, the team lost to San Francisco in the first round of the playoffs. To commemorate Portland's 1945 pennant win, Portland held a banquet at the Multnomah Hotel (now the downtown Portland Embassy Suites). Oregon Governor Earl Snell presented a commemorative watch and gold and diamond ring to each player at the banquet. The watches were given to the players because L.H. Gregory of \"The Oregonian\" requested that fans donate money to a fund for the purpose. Gregory did this because he felt it was not right that no memento was given to the players from the 1936 championship team. Following the 1945 season, Norgan purchased Klepper's share of the team, becoming the team's new owner.\nIn 1946 the Beavers fell to the bottom half of the league, finishing in seventh place, 41 games out of first. In 1947 Eddie Basinski joined the Beavers, and they finished third, losing to the Los Angeles Angels in the first round of the playoffs. The team drew a record of 421,000 fans that season. This record would stand for the Beavers until the 2001 season when AAA Baseball returned to Portland.\nIn 1948 the team finish fifth, followed by a sixth-place finish in 1949. The 1949 season began the integration of the Pacific Coast League as Frankie Austin and Luis Marques became Beavers. Beginning with the 1950 season the Beavers finished fourth for four straight years. Clay Hopper, who had been Jackie Robinson's manager when he played for the Montreal Royals in 1946, was named the team's manager in 1952. This year also marked the first year the Pacific Coast League, and the Portland Beavers, were classified by the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues as an \"Open League.\" The open league was a step above AAA, and was an attempted by the Pacific Coast League to be considered the third major league.\nPlans for a new ballpark were announced by the team in 1953. Originally the team planned to build a new stadium at 82nd &amp; Holgate in Southeast Portland. Due to the Korean War, among other issues, the stadium never came to fruition. In 1954 the team dropped again to the bottom of the league. After the 1954 season the team went up for sale via public stock, which resulted in 2,400 new owners for the 1955 season. With the change the Beavers rose to fifth place, only nine games back of first.\nIn 1956, the Beavers left Vaughn Street Park to move into 25,000-seat Multnomah Stadium, eventually renamed Civic Stadium. Throughout most of the 1960s, the Beavers were the AAA affiliate of the American League Cleveland Indians, nurturing such future stars as \"Sudden\" Sam McDowell, Lou \"Mad Dog\" Piniella, and Luis \"El Gigante\" Tiant. Later major league affiliations included Minnesota and Philadelphia.\nIndependent baseball in Portland: 1973–1977.\nAfter 1972, in which the Beavers drew fewer than 92,000 fans for the entire season, the team left Portland for Spokane. The Class A Portland Mavericks filled the void left by the departure of the Beavers. The Mavericks played in the short-season Northwest League, with a schedule running from mid-June through August. They won four division titles in their five-year history (second place in 1974), but never won the league championship.\nAAA returns to Portland: 1978–1993.\nThe PCL expanded in 1978 and added a new team in Portland, calling themselves the Beavers. The new Beavers played in Civic Stadium through 1992. In 1983, the Beavers won the PCL pennant, the first for Portland in 47 years. Though finishing fourth overall that year, the Beavers defeated the Edmonton Trappers to win the Northern Division title, then bested the Albuquerque Dukes in the finals to capture the flag.\nAfter the 1993 season, Beavers owner Joe Buzas moved the team to Salt Lake City, where they became the Salt Lake Buzz, and later the Stingers. Their current nickname is the Bees.\nNorthwest League baseball: 1994–2000.\nFor the first time since 1899, Portland was without a baseball team for the 1994 season. The departure of the PCL did eventually bring about the return of the short-season Northwest League. Following their inaugural season in 1994, the Class A Bend Rockies relocated to the now available market of Portland in 1995. The Portland Rockies played in the Rose City for the next six seasons and served an important role for the city, whose demand for a major league team was growing. Portland's support for the Rockies paved the way for the return of AAA baseball in 2001.\nThe Beavers return: 2000–2010.\nFollowing the 2000 season, the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres swapped AAA teams. The Albuquerque Dukes (a charter franchise of the PCL under the name Los Angeles Angels) moved to Portland, becoming the Beavers, as the San Diego Padres affiliate. As part of the relocation agreement, Civic Stadium was renovated in 2000 and renamed PGE Park. The Dodgers took control of the Padres' Las Vegas Stars, who would be renamed the 51's. The Portland Rockies would move up the Columbia River to Pasco and become the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2001.\nDuring this time, Dr. Lynn Lashbrook spearheaded the effort to bring MLB to Portland. In 2003, Dr. Lashbrook led the lobbying efforts that resulted in a $150 million construction bill for a new baseball stadium in Portland. Under his leadership, the group secured legislative action to subsidize a new stadium with ballplayers’ payroll taxes.\nIn 2007, owner Merritt Paulson announced that he was considering changing the name of the team to prevent confusion with the Oregon State University Beavers, whose baseball team won the national championships in 2006 and 2007. Possible new names and logos were unveiled, and a vote was staged on the team website. \"Portland Beavers\" won the contest, and the team unveiled new logos and colors on January 29, 2008. The Beavers emphasized their connection to the three prior franchises with the notation \"Est. 1903\" on their primary logo. The team also brought back the name \"Lucky Beavers\" as part of a sleeve patch on their alternate jersey.\nIn 2009, the city of Portland was awarded a Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise for 2011, to be named the Portland Timbers. The Portland City Council approved a $31 million agreement to renovate PGE Park to a soccer- and football-only stadium, with the condition that a new ballpark be built in Portland for the Beavers by 2011.\nInitial plans called for the new ballpark to be built at the site currently occupied by the Memorial Coliseum, which would have been torn down, but public outcry about demolishing a Portland landmark led Portland mayor Sam Adams to propose a second site in the Rose Quarter area north of Memorial Coliseum. The site, however, proved to be too small. Another location in the Lents neighborhood in southeast Portland was also rejected due to objections from neighbors.\nIn June 2009, the Portland City Council voted to separate the soccer and baseball projects, allowing renovation of PGE Park to proceed without completed plans for a baseball stadium in place. Other locations in the Portland area were considered for the ballpark, including a vacant terminal at the Port of Portland, Delta Park, the Portland Expo Center, Portland Meadows, the Westwood Corporation Heliport site, a building owned by Portland Public Schools near the Rose Quarter, and suburban locations in Beaverton, Clackamas, and Vancouver, Washington. None of these sites progressed past initial discussions.\nWith no suitable Portland location available, in July 2010, Paulson announced that he was putting the team up for sale and relocation, and the Beavers played their last game in Portland on September 6, 2010, beating the Las Vegas 51s 6–5 before a sellout crowd. Padres owner Jeff Moorad formed a group to buy the team and talked of moving its home games to the Lake Elsinore Diamond in Lake Elsinore, California, until a new stadium in Escondido could be built. Eventually, the group decided to move the team temporarily to Tucson, rename them the Tucson Padres, and then move again to Escondido when the new ballpark is built.\nAttempts to bring baseball back to Portland: 2011–2012.\nOn August 2, 2011, the Milwaukie city council unanimously encouraged city staff to continue its efforts to bring professional baseball back to the Portland-Metro area. It had previously been reported in \"The Oregonian\" that the city's economic development director had been working with other individuals and groups to place a 4,000-seat ballpark on a state owned maintenance facility within the city near their border with Portland. A MAX Light Rail line that is under construction will go by the proposed site, which would facilitate access to proposed ballpark, and the two projects are spurring interest in the area by developers. At the October 4, 2011, council meeting, the council directed city staff to engage the community in discussions about the project and authorized them to hire a consultant to further research the project.\nThe Northwest League returns: 2013–present.\nIn 2012, it was announced that Portland suburb Hillsboro had reached a deal to relocate the Yakima Bears. Construction of a new 4,500-seat stadium in Hillsboro began later that year and was completed in June 2013, as the home of the renamed Hillsboro Hops. The Hops replaced the Beavers as Portland's minor league baseball team. The team's first game was a 3–2 road loss to the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes; the team's home opener was notable for several firsts: the team's first sellout, drawing over 4,700 fans; the team's—and Hillsboro Ballpark's—first home run; and the team's first win.\nSummer Collegiate Woodbat League brings baseball to Portland 2016–present.\nIn 2015, it was announced that the Portland Pickles would be the newest team added to the Great West League. In 2018 they moved to the West Coast League, a premier collegiate summer baseball league based in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. The Pickles play their home games at Walker Stadium in Portland's Lents Park."

        "text": "The 1980 New Zealand tour of Wales was a collection of friendly rugby union games undertaken by the New Zealand All Blacks against Wales that also took in two international games in North America en route to South Wales. This was a single test tour against each of the countries played, with four games against Welsh club opposition.\nAlthough the games were played within a tight schedule, the All Blacks were victorious in all seven matches. New Zealand scored 32 tries for and only conceding 2 against, for a total points tally of 197 to 41 over the entire tour.\nMatches.\nLlanelli RFC.\nLike the game played three days earlier against Cardiff, Llanelli proved tough opposition for the touring New Zealand side. Of the seven games played during the tour this was the closest in score, with only a six-point margin and at half time Llanelli were actually 10–3 ahead.\nThis match is often remembered for a controversial refereeing decision by Scottish referee Alan Hosie. Towards the end of the game, with the match still in the balance, Hosie appeared to send off the All Black lock, Graeme Higginson, only for a group of Llanelli players, led by Phil Bennett to challenge the referee over the action. Higginson was allowed to stay on the field with Hosie stating later that there was no sending off, and he had only giving Higginson a warning.\nWales.\nThe All Blacks returned to the Cardiff Arms Park in the final game of the tour and quickly showed a dominance of the game that\nwould continue until the final whistle. The fact that roughly 85% of the match was played in the Welsh half of the field correlates with the final score and the four tries from New Zealand that were without a Welsh reply. The defeat would have been far heavier, but Rollerson managed to convert only three of nine attempts at goal.\nFrom this match only three Welsh players emerged with any credit. Full back J.P.R. Williams, scrum half Terry Holmes and on the wing 19-year-old Robert Ackerman, whose excellent covering play of Stu Wilson earned him a standing ovation when he left the field with an injury before the final whistle."

Educated at The Geelong College from 1909 to 1919, he showed enormous potential as a young sportsman, having won the Victorian School Boys U19 tennis title for 5 years in a row – described by historian Graeme Kinross Smith as the \"nursery for tennis talent\". Hawkes had also been touted as a future test cricketer for Australia and was made a member of the MCC at the age of 13. He was captain of the first Cricket team for the last 4 years of his school life at The Geelong College and according to school website, \"In a legendary day of bowling in 1916, Jack Hawkes was to claim 10 wickets in a match against Wesley College.\" Tennis, however, was to create a more powerful pull than cricket. Taught on the lawn court at the family home \"Llanberis\", overlooking Corio Bay by family friend Russell Keays and influenced by tennis legend and family friend, Norman Brookes, Jack's career blossomed in the 1920s. The left-hander won a clean sweep at the Australasian Championships of 1926, winning the men's singles, men's doubles and mixed doubles in the same year. Hawkes had five championship points in a marathon singles final against his doubles partner Gerald Patterson in the Australian Championships in 1927, but went on to lose the match in five sets. Hawkes also won two US mixed doubles titles, won a total of three Australian doubles titles with Gerald Patterson and was runner-up with Gerald Patterson in Wimbledon doubles and US doubles of 1928. Hawkes also won a total of three mixed doubles Australian championships.\nHawkes was a three-times Davis Cup representative in 1921, 1923, 1925 and was controversially omitted from the team in the year of his Australian Open crown in 1926 and successful overseas tour of 1928. After his retirement from tennis, Hawkes was actively involved in tennis administration and ran the family business Hawkes Brothers, in Geelong until his retirement in the early 1970s. Jack Hawkes retired to Ocean Grove (where he had holidayed as a child at the family's beachside home \"Imbool\"), and later to Barwon Heads before his death in Geelong, at the age of 90 after a short illness, on 31 March 1990. He was survived by his wife Mickey and their four children; Ann, Sally, Sue and John."

        "text": "Cricket is the most popular sport in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is one of the twelve nations that take part in Test cricket and one of the six nations that has won a cricket World Cup. Cricket is played at professional, semi-professional and recreational levels in the country and international cricket matches are watched with interest by a large proportion of the population.\nSri Lanka (then called Ceylon) was occupied by the British in 1796 and became a British colony in 1815. As in all places that the British arrived in large numbers, cricket soon followed and it is reasonable to assume that the game was first played on the island by 1800. The earliest definite mention of cricket in Ceylon was a report in the \"Colombo Journal\" on 5 September 1832 which called for the formation of a cricket club. The Colombo Cricket Club was formed soon afterwards and matches began in November 1832. Since then, the sport has grown domestically with major events such as the Premier Trophy (dating from 1938) and the Premier Limited Overs Tournament (starting 1988–89). Sri Lanka's one day international debut came in the 1975 Cricket World Cup. The country was awarded Test cricket status by the International Cricket Council in 1981.\nGoverning body.\nSri Lanka Cricket, formerly the Board for Cricket Control in Sri Lanka (BCCSL), is the controlling body for cricket in Sri Lanka. It operates the Sri Lankan cricket team, Sri Lanka A cricket team, Sri Lankan women's cricket team and first-class cricket within Sri Lanka.\nSri Lanka is a full member of the International Cricket Council and the Asian Cricket Council. Sri Lanka co-hosted the 1996 Cricket World Cup and the 2011 Cricket World Cup.\nDomestic competitions.\nSri Lanka Cricket oversees the progress and handling of the major domestic competitions: the First-class tournaments – SLC Tier A and B Premier Trophy, the List A tournament – Premier Limited Overs Tournament and the Twenty20 competition – SLC Twenty20 Tournament, in which the following first-class teams may take part:\nSeveral competitions have been arranged where teams were formed out of each of the major provinces, independent to the above clubs:\nNational cricket team.\nThe Sri Lankan cricket team is the national cricket team of Sri Lanka. The team first played One day international cricket in the 1975 Cricket World Cup and were later awarded Test status in 1981, which made Sri Lanka the eighth Test cricket playing nation.\nThe Sri Lankan team transformed themselves from the underdog status to a leading cricketing nation during the 1990s.

        "title": "Cricket in South Africa",
        "text": "Cricket is the third most popular sport in South Africa (behind football and rugby union). Traditionally played by English-speaking Whites, Indians, Coloureds and more recently, the Black community. The sport is now listed in the top two most popular among all race groups. Since the end of apartheid, a higher proportion of white players have come from Afrikaans-speaking backgrounds as well.\nLike other Commonwealth cricket playing nations, the sport was first introduced in South Africa by the British in the early 19th Century, with the sport becoming firmly established by the 1880s. Governed by Cricket South Africa, both the professional and amateur game possess a high standard of domestic cricket, with the season running from October to March each year. South Africa is one of the world's leading cricket-playing nations and is one of the 12 countries sanctioned by the International Cricket Council to play Test Cricket. In 2012, South Africa became the first team to top the ICC rankings in all three formats of the game.\nIn 2003, the country hosted the Cricket World Cup, and in 2007, the inaugural World Twenty20. Along with Namibia and Zimbabwe, South Africa will jointly host the upcoming 2027 Cricket World Cup.\nHistory.\nEmergence.\nIn 1814, the Cape Colony was formally ceded to Britain by the Dutch after two previous occupations by British forces during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. It is believed that cricket was first introduced to South Africa during the first occupation, an expedition led by General Sir James Craig. An accompanying officer, Charles Anguish, had been an early member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), playing 32 first-class matches before he departed for the Cape in 1795. It is supposed that Anguish organised inter-military matches upon his arrival. The earliest definite reference to cricket is dated to 1808, during the second occupation. The Cape Town Gazette and African Advertiser carried a notice that:“A grand match at cricket will be played for 1,000 dollars aside on Tuesday, January 5, 1808, between the officers of the artillery mess, having Colonel Austen of the 60th Regiment, and the officers of the Colony, with General Clavering. The wickets are to be pitched at 10 o'clock.”The first club known to have been formally established was at Port Elizabeth in 1843, with the land allocated still in use today as St George’s Park. In 1876, Port Elizabeth presented the ‘Champions Bat’, a competition between towns in the Cape; initially Cape Town, Grahamstown, King William’s Town and Port Elizabeth itself, the rudimental beginnings of domestic cricket in South Africa.\nThe years 1888 and 1889 are pivotal ones for the emergence of modern cricket in South Africa. Two major venues were presented, Newlands in Cape Town and the Old Wanderers in Johannesburg, and an English team arrived for the first overseas tour of South Africa. In March 1889, two matches were played between England and South African XI, in what retrospectively would be determined to be both the inaugural Test played by South Africa, and the inaugural first-class match played in South Africa. South Africa lost both matches but became the world’s third Test nation.\nIn December 1889, first-class domestic cricket began, albeit on a challenge only footing, when Port Elizabeth Cricket Club hosted Natal at St George's Park. Sir Donald Currie, the founder of the Castle Shipping Line who had sponsored the English tour, donated a trophy for the domestic champions. The ‘Currie Cup’ was first awarded to Kimberley at the end of the 1889-90 season. From the 1892-93 season, first-class cricket gradually emerged into the more familiar province-based competition in a championship format.\nIn 1907, Abe Bailey, the President of the South African Cricket Association, wrote a letter to the Marylebone Cricket Club’s secretary, Sir Francis Lacey, and suggested the formation of an ‘Imperial Cricket Board’. Responsible for the formulation of rules, regulation and overall governance of international matches played between Australia, England and South Africa. Although Australia initially rejected the arrangement Bailey continued his lobbying, and during Australia's tour of England in 1909, he eventually received agreement. On 15 June 1909, representatives from Australia, England and South Africa met at Lord’s and founded the Imperial Cricket Conference. Subsequent meetings were held that agreed on rules amongst the nations and the first Tri-Test series was to be held in England in 1912.\n1910–1960.\nThe South African War, as well as the First World War, disrupted cricket and led to its suspension. After the Armistice in 1918, South African cricket resumed and continuously toured and received visits from England and Australia. Although having a somewhat disappointing period during the 1920s, in the final pre-war decade South Africa became a consistently high-quality and competitive team. During this time, cricket in South Africa began to spread outside the British settler diaspora, particularly in the Afrikaner and Indian communities. However, cricket remained strictly, although not legally, segregated with various national bodies governing cricket for the different racial groups. First-class domestic and international cricket was white only, and would only play other white Test nations (India and the West Indies joined the ICC in 1926).\nSuspended once again during the Second World War, cricket in South Africa resumed after 1945. The introduction of apartheid (separation of racial groups by strict legal enforcement) following the 1948 General Election did not immediately affect the sport, and it continued to prosper and welcome visiting teams.\nInternational isolation 1961–1991.\nSouth Africa left the Commonwealth after a successful 1960 South African republican referendum on 31 May 1961, and by extension, they also left the ICC as membership was entwined. Despite the rules being changed to allow \"associate members\" in 1964, South Africa did not reapply but continued to play against Australia, England and New Zealand without much difficulty.\nAs decolonisation accelerated, and international moral public opinion began to change away ideas of racial, particularly white, superiority, South Africa became increasingly isolated. The anti-apartheid movement demanded that South Africa face boycotts, including in sport. Within the ICC, non-white members, particularly India, protested loudly about the discrimination their own diaspora received in South Africa, including the policies of apartheid which now legally barred non-whites from playing Test cricket for South Africa and the refusal of accepting touring teams that fielded non-whites. In 1970, the ICC banned South Africa from participating in internationally recognised cricket. This decision, arguably when South Africa was the strongest team in the world, cut short the Test careers of hugely talented players, such as Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards and Mike Procter. Many promising players later emigrated in order to play, whilst others never played Test cricket despite strong domestic first-class records.\nThe effect of the international boycott had significant impacts on the domestic game and cricket development. Standards, attendances and participation fell, along with South Africa missing out on the revolutionary changes to the game. The beginnings of limited-overs matches, including the new World Cup, cost South Africa financially, as well as evolutionary. Although South Africa tried to desegregate cricket in 1976 with the formation of a non-racial governing body, the South African Cricket Union (SACU), the ICC maintained their ban.  \nThroughout the 1980s, ‘Rebel Tours’ were sponsored in which international, although not official, teams would tour South Africa playing Test and limited-overs. Between 1982 and 1990, seven tours were staged by four teams; Australia, England, the West Indies and Sri Lanka. Players joining ‘rebel tours’ ran considerable risks to their own careers and reputations, with many facing a limited or lifetime ban from cricket upon their return. As an incentive, at a time when cricketers were not paid a great deal, the SACU offered substantial amounts of money to rebel teams.\nInternational return.\nIn July 1991, as South Africa negotiated a political way toward majority rule, the ICC reinstated South Africa as a Test nation and authorised the playing of international matches. By November, South Africa had played its first ODI, and first sanctioned match since 1970, against India in Calcutta, before playing their first Test match against the West Indies in April 1992. During the rest of the decade and early 21st Century, the national side gained a reputation as \"chokers\" and underachievers due to reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup four times but failing to progress, despite having hugely talented players, such as Hansie Cronje, as well as favourable win percentages. In 1998, South Africa won the inaugural Champions Trophy. To date, this remains the only silverware won by the men’s national team. Although South Africa had spent 22 years away from ICC regulated cricket, the national side quickly re-confirmed their place as a highly competitive side, with particular notoriety in fast bowling.\nDomestically, cricket in South Africa responded to the political changes that had happened with the election of the ANC in 1994, and the return of South Africa to the Commonwealth of Nations on 1 June 1994 as a Commonwealth republic, particularly the changing of team names in the Castle Cup (formerly Currie). Orange Free State become Free State (1995–96), Eastern Transvaal became Easterns (1995–96), Western Transvaal became North West (1996–97), Transvaal became Gauteng (1997–98), Northern Transvaal became Northerns (1997–98) and Natal became KwaZulu-Natal (1998–99). The competition itself changed name for sponsorship reasons, first becoming the Castle Cup in 1990-91, before being the SuperSport Series in 1996-97. In 2004-05, the format of South African domestic cricket changed entirely and broke with the past. The former 11 provincial teams were replaced by six, fully professional, franchise teams. Cape Cobras, the Eagles (later the Knights), the Warriors, the Lions, the Titans and the Dolphins were created and now represented the highest form of domestic cricket, both in first-class and limited-overs.\nIn the 21st Century, cricket in South Africa has evolved and significantly diversified. In July 2006, Ashwell Prince at the age of 29, became the first non-white man to captain the South African cricket team when he deputised for Graeme Smith. Racial quotas were first introduced and later rescinded in 2007, although were re-established in 2016, despite being highly controversial, particularly criticised by the Institute of Race Relations in South Africa. A South African team must now have an average minimum of six non-white players, of which two must be black African, in matches over the season. This has led to some highly capable white players emigrating from South Africa claiming they were disadvantaged by discrimination. Kevin Pietersen, who was born in Pietermaritzburg, left South Africa to play for England, later becoming one of the world’s best batsman.\nSince readmission in 1991, South Africa has been a consistently strong team and the equal of any Test nation. Although major silverware has consistently eluded the team, the early 2010s saw a period of Test dominance, achieving top position in the ICC rankings in 2012. Eight days later, in August 2012, South Africa became the first team to top the rankings in all three formats of the game. The No.1 spot was later regained by South Africa in 2014 after losing it to Australia earlier in the year.\nSouth African women.\nThe South African Women’s Team made their Test debut in 1960 against England, becoming the fourth team to play at such a level. The ICC boycott on South African cricket also affected the women’s game, with the team not playing an international fixture until 1997. Only 12 ICC Women’s Tests have been played by South Africa, winning only once, and the last being played in 2014. As the game has developed, the ODI and T20 have become far more popular and financially rewarding, pushing Women’s Test cricket to the edge of viability. Playing their first ODI against Ireland in 1997, South Africa have a 50% win rate, being semi-finalists twice, in the 2000 and 2017 World Cup. In T20, the team first competed in Australia in 2007, and have since played over 100 matches and six World Cups. Being semi-finalists twice, in 2014 and 2020, the team are currently ranked fifth by the ICC, with a win rate of 44%.\nGoverning body.\nCricket South Africa (CSA) is the governing body for professional and amateur cricket in South Africa. In 1991, the separate South African Cricket Union and the South African Cricket Board merged to form the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCB), ending enforced racial separation governance in South African cricket. Cricket South Africa was formed in 2002 and initially ran parallel to the UCB, before becoming the sole governing body in 2008. As an affiliate of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC), a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and African Cricket Association, CSA administers all levels of cricket in South Africa, including the national teams in all three formats for both men and women. CSA organises and manages visiting tours to South Africa, as well as administering domestic cricket. A large part of CSA’s effort is investing in youth and grassroots development, particularly in deprived areas.\nIn recent years, Cricket South Africa has faced a huge amount of internal upheaval and disorganisation that has significantly damaged the reputation of South African cricket at home and abroad, as well as even threatening ICC membership. In December 2019, CEO Thabang Moroe was suspended pending the outcome of an independent forensic audit, before being dismissed in August 2020 for \"serious misconduct\". In September 2020, the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) announced that they had suspended Cricket South Africa due to \"maladministration and malpractices\", and had taken over cricket operations in the country. It was later announced that the acting CEO, Kugandrie Govender, would herself be suspended, pending the outcome of a hearing into allegations of misconduct.\nSince the first reports came to light of the severe mismanagement, the organisation has come under heavy criticism from sponsors, players, and the wider cricket community over governance issues. The International Cricket Council has announced it could suspend South Africa due to government interference in the sport, which is against ICC rules.\nInternational cricket.\nMen's.\nTest: Having hosted and played their first international first-class game against England in 1888-89, South Africa developed into a competitive team by the start of the 20th century. Arguably the best team in the world in 1970 when the ICC imposed an international ban due to apartheid, since readmittance in 1991 South Africa have reasserted themselves as a strong team. Although previously holding the number one position in the international rankings, as of 2021, the Proteas are currently ranked fourth in the world.\nODI: Playing their first One Day International against India soon after readmittance in 1991, South Africa have reached the ODI World Cup Semi-Finals four times, most recently in 2015, but never progressed further. With a current high win percentage of 63%, the team’s wider fortunes have also fluctuated and currently sit at third in the ODI rankings, although having previously been number one.\nT20I: South Africa played their first T20I against New Zealand in 2005. Much like the other national squads, the T20I teams' fortunes have varied and have been close to silverware. Appearing in 6 T20 World Cups, the Proteas have been semi-finalists twice, most recently in 2014. With a current win rate of 56%, they are also ranked fifth in the world as well as previously being number one.\nWomen's.\nTest: Making their debut in 1960 against England, the women’s team did not play any international fixtures between 1972 and 1997. Despite being the oldest form of women’s cricket in South Africa, the Proteas have played just 14 Test matches, with the most recent being in 2024 and winning only one against the Netherlands in 2007. T20 has taken on a far more prominent and financially rewarding role, almost ending women's Test cricket as a viable entity.\nODI: The women’s team played their first One Day International against Ireland in 1997, and have a current win rate of roughly 50% over nearly 200 matches. Playing in six Women’s World Cups, the Proteas have been semi-finalists twice, in 2000 and 2017, although never progressing further. South Africa are currently third in the ICC World ODI rankings.\nT20I: The Proteas’ first T20I was in 2007 against Australia, and have since played over 100 matches. Competing in 6 Women’s T20 World Cups, South Africa have been semi-finalists in 2014 and in 2020. Ranked fifth in the ICC table, South Africa have a T20I win rate of 44%.\nDomestic cricket.\nMen.\nSouth Africa's first-class competition began in 1889–1890, initially on a challenge only basis rather than a structured championship. Sir Donald Currie, who had sponsored the first English tour of South Africa earlier that year, donated a trophy for the domestic champions, the Currie Cup. From the 1892-93 season, first-class domestic cricket in South Africa gradually emerged into the more familiar province-based champion season. This competition format, with occasional changes and additions, survived until the 2004/05 season when the domestic structure was remodelled across all three formats to introduce six, entirely professional, franchise teams. The eleven provincial Currie Cup teams, as well as South Western Districts and KwaZulu-Natal Inland, continued to compete separately in the Provincial Three-Day Challenge, which remained a first-class competition, although on a semi-professional level and no longer the top level of red-ball cricket in South Africa.\nIn 2021, Cricket South Africa announced a return to the traditional province based domestic structure. 15 first-class teams now play in two divisions, determined by promotion and relegation.\nEight teams make up the first division, with 16 contracted players each, and seven teams the second division, with 11 contracted players each, taking the total to 205.\nCSA believes that the new format will provide more opportunities for players to compete at a high standard just below international cricket, in turn providing a wider talent pool for the national selectors. It is hoped that wider selection of teams at the highest domestic level will help increase playing opportunities of all races, particularly those currently underrepresented.\nSouth Africa's major domestic competitions are the CSA 4-Day Series (four day first-class competition) and the Momentum One Day Cup (List A one-day competition). Division 1 will take part in the Mzanzi Super League (T20 competition), whilst Division 2 compete in a separate T20 tournament.\nWomen.\nFor women, CSA Provincial Cricket is currently the top level of cricket in South Africa, however, it remains semi-professional. Since 2017, South African women have played in the Women's T20 Super League. Further developing the women’s game at a high level, CSA has said that the competition will allow top performing players from across the under-19s and provincial cricket to continue and improve domestic standards, as well as ultimately strengthening the national limited-over sides. As of 2021, there have not been any reports to indicate women’s domestic cricket will be affected by the restructuring announced for the men's game.\nRecreational and development.\nCSA, the sports governing body in South Africa, devotes considerable resources towards youth participation and development. As the vast majority of South African schools do not have the financially expensive, but necessary, cricket support infrastructure in place, CSA provides multiple regional and district programs, often via their Performance Centres. The KFC Mini-Cricket programme is usually the first introduction to cricket that many school children, both boys and girls, will enjoy. Running between the ages of four and thirteen, more than 126,000 school children have participated in this programme, while the number of coaches and schools involved have increased to nearly 14,000 and 7,000 respectively.\nNational inter-provincial competitions are played at under-13, under-15, under-17 and under-19 levels for boys, and at under-15 and under-19 levels for girls. Through the Talent Acceleration Programme, the best players, particularly those who are disadvantaged, can be selected without any bias against their background. Multiple financial initiatives are available that provide support to deprived young cricketers. From Youth to International progression, CSA nourishes potential talent through various Provincial and Regional Academies, as well as the National Academy and the High-Performance Centre.\nPopularity.\nCricket traditionally has been the most popular South African sport for English-speaking whites, as well as the Indian community, although the latter was not able to compete at the top level during the apartheid era. While the popularity remains high, a larger proportion of white players now come from Afrikaner-speaking backgrounds, such as Hansie Cronje, AB de Villiers, Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen and Francois du Plessis, since 1991. As the colour bar was removed from South African sport, from the late 1990s cricket has grown at a substantial rate in other racial groups, particularly black African. Omar Henry became the first Coloured person to play a Test match for South Africa in 1992, with Makhaya Ntini being the first black African in 1998. Originally seen as a game for \"white gentlemen\" only, the country has since spawned skillful cricketers who are people of colour, such as Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj, Tabraiz Shamsi, Reeza Hendricks and Lungi Ngidi."

        "title": "Equestrian use of roadways",
        "text": "The use of horses for transportation, either by horseback riding or by driving carriages and wagons on roads, was the primary form of transportation before the advent of automobiles in the late 19th century. However, horses are still used for transport in many parts of the world, including places where certain sects such as the Amish reside. Horses are also ridden on the roads for pleasure, for example travelling from their stables to bridle paths and trails. Equestrians and motorists should take safety precautions to avoid serious accidents when sharing the roadways.\nAmish communities.\nThroughout history, transportation using horse-drawn vehicles has developed into a more modern realm, eventually becoming today's automobile. However, in certain areas of Ohio and Pennsylvania, horse and buggy is the main form of transportation. The Amish, Mennonite, and the Brethren community can be dated back to as early as the sixteenth century. In the eighteen hundreds, members of their conservative Christian faith fled Europe and began a new life in a small county in Pennsylvania called Lancaster. They are best known for their simple lifestyles, including having limited forms of electricity, living off the land, and having very conservative viewpoints on a number of topics. Many families have adapted to the modern age and now allow some forms of technology, as long as it does not interrupt or affect family time. Amish are forbidden to own cars but are allowed to ride in them when needed. That is why the Amish, Mennonite, and Brethren populations use horse and buggy as their main mode of transportation.\nAccidents.\nOhio and Pennsylvania both have large populations of Amish and Mennonite using horse-drawn buggies as their primary means of transportation. There are a significant number of buggy-motor vehicle collisions each year. The primary crash is during daylight on straight roadways with no adverse weather conditions. Most accidents are by locals to whom buggies are a common sight, rather than tourists who slow down with the novelty. The usual cause is \"following too closely\", resulting in a rear-end crash to the buggy. One report said Pennsylvania and Ohio average 60 buggy/motor vehicle crashes per year, another report said Ohio reports more than 120 buggy accidents a year. Pennsylvania reported a high of 78 such crashes in 2006.\nSuch accidents are often fatal to the carriage occupants, or involve serious injuries from having been struck or thrown from the carriage. Horses are often killed outright, or have to be euthanized after sustaining serious injuries. These accidents are costly—motor vehicles can be seriously damaged by hitting a large animal such as a horse, and buggies are usually demolished.\nIt doesn't take much for a motor vehicle crashing with a carriage to cause fatalities. In England, two men and the horse pulling a trap were declared dead at the scene of a collision with a Volkswagen Golf, a compact car.\nRiders are equally at risk. They can be struck by motor vehicles, or be thrown from their horse which was spooked by a motorcycle or vehicles passing too closely.\nSafety precautions.\nVisibility.\nRiders should wear high-visibility clothing to make themselves more visible to high speed motor traffic—fluorescent colors for daytime, and reflective strips for night time visibility. Horses should also be outfitted with hi-vis, which might include a fluorescent cloth on the rear and reflective strips around the legs or tail.\nIn the United States and Canada, regulations require that all vehicles on roadways that cannot reach a speed of 25 mph or 40 kph must display a slow moving vehicle sign. This includes horse drawn vehicles. There are a few exceptions made for religious beliefs that prohibit bright colors, and in some cases white-and-gray reflector schemes are permitted instead of the usual red-and-orange.\nCarriages and buggies on the streets at night should have reflectors and lights to avoid being struck from behind. It is recommended that frequent users of the road during night hours, such as Amish buggies, should add battery-operated flashing lights (red to the rear, and white strobe lights on top of buggies), and reflective leg and neck wraps for their horses. In hilly areas where roads undulate, adding a tall bicycle flag is a good idea.\nRiding or driving a horse on the roads is best done during daylight and in fair weather to avoid low visibility conditions.\nProtective equipment.\nWhen riding over hard surfaces, such as streets, riders should wear a helmet and a body protector vest or even an air bag vest to reduce injuries during a fall. In some cases, horses should wear leg protection. In icy conditions, horse shoes might be fitted with studs or caulkins.\nRiding or driving on the road.\nIf a horse is unfamiliar with riding on roads, avoiding roads altogether is a safe practice. Horses can be spooked fairly easily, and to minimize horses becoming panicked during a ride, avoiding a busy roadway is a good safety precaution to take. However, if it is necessary to ride on the roadway or cross a roadway, having a more experienced company can be helpful. Riding single file, as well as crossing major roadways in a group increases visibility for oncoming motorists. Although horses are rather large animals, from a far distance it is easier to see a number of horses rather than just one.\nRiders should walk rather than go in a faster gait on roadways that are hard and smooth, such as asphalt. Higher speeds lead to a greater risk of the horse slipping or falling with the rider.\nMotorists.\nA horse travelling on the road is probably going about 5 to 8 miles per hour (8–13 kph), not much faster than a pedestrian. Motorists encountering horses on the roadway should immediately slow down. A car traveling 55 mph (88 kph) can close a 500-foot (150-metre) gap on a horse in just 6.5 seconds. Riders and drivers may not see motor vehicles behind them, and they may be unable to move out of the way due to deep ditches or other edge-of-road hazards. Motorists should not blow their horn anywhere near a horse. Horses are prey animals that may spook at sounds or strange sights and might jump \"towards\" traffic, so when passing a horse, motorists should do so slowly and leave a wide berth around the horse. A collision with a horse can have serious consequences to the motor vehicle, its occupants, as well as the horse and rider or carriage.\nLaws.\nAs a rule of thumb, around the world riders are generally allowed where pedestrians are permitted, and carriages are allowed wherever wheeled slow moving vehicles are permitted. Riders and drivers are generally \"not\" permitted on limited-access roads where motor traffic is expected to be travelling very fast. Carriages are treated as \"vehicles\" and should travel in the same direction as motor traffic, but at the far edge of the road due to their slow speeds.\nThe state of New York has regulations for the use of horses on the road—both being ridden upon and being horse-driven vehicles. Some regulations only allow passing the horse-driven vehicle or horseback rider when it is safe to do so and prohibiting the use of any form of noise, such as a horn.\nReflectors at the rear of a horse-drawn vehicle must be visible from 500 feet when illuminated by the lower beams of headlamps of a motor vehicle.\nMitigation efforts by government.\nOhio's Amish population is the largest in the world. In 2000, Ohio published the findings of a comprehensive study of the issue of buggy-vehicle crashes. Interviewing the Amish communities, motor vehicle drivers, and other stakeholders, they came up with a series of recommendations to help reduce crashes. Among the recommendations were: widen road shoulders to 8 feet (especially after the cresting of a hill), add pull-off lanes for buggies to allow vehicles to pass, construct separate buggy trails, increase bus service to Amish communities, set a minimum age for buggy operators, develop driver education courses for Amish buggy drivers (in cooperation with the Amish School Board), add buggy awareness to the youth motor driving curriculum, and run public information campaigns to address sharing the roadway. Another concern was identification of victims in a crash (buggy operator and passengers), as Amish don't routinely carry government issued identification and their vehicles don't carry license plates. Ohio and the Amish communities were reportedly working on solving that.\nOhio also proposed an Amish Buggy Warning Detection System in 2000. The system would mount flashing lights on road signs warning motorists to be aware of a buggy ahead. The lights would be set off by the passing of a buggy containing a non-electric pod which would trip the detectors, and the lights would stop flashing after a predetermined time."

        "title": "Maidenhead Rowing Club",
        "text": "Maidenhead Rowing Club is a rowing club, on the River Thames in England at Maidenhead, Berkshire.\nThe clubhouse is on the reach above Bray Lock on the Maidenhead bank of the Thames between Maidenhead Railway Bridge and Maidenhead Bridge. The club regularly races at local and national events with considerable success.\nThe club's colours are Brunswick green and white, and its symbol is a five-pointed star. There is also a coat of arms used on the club's blazer badges, which features a shield with a five-pointed star on one half, and a 'Maiden's head' on the other half, with a pair of crossed oars and arm above it, and the words 'Manu Forti' (\"strong arm\") below it.\nHistory.\nEarly years\nThe earliest record of rowing in Maidenhead is from July 5, 1839, where a regatta was held on the Cliveden Reach several weeks after the first-ever Henley Regatta. Two boats from Maidenhead competed for the Town Cup for four-oared boats - the 'Star' and the 'Lady of the Lake'.\nThe following year, 'The Star' club from Maidenhead entered the District Challenge Cup at Henley Regatta. The crew was formed of W. Skindle, H. Fuller, G. Robinson, J. Brown(s) and W. Brown(c) (given the time period, W. Skindle can safely be assumed to be William Skindle, who was the founder of the infamous Skindles hotel in Maidenhead). They were beaten in the first round by the 'Albion' club from Henley.\nVery little is known about 'The Star' rowing club, and after this inaugural appearance at Henley, this club seemed to disappear, and no known rowing club existed between 1840 and 1876. Regattas were held in Maidenhead over this time period - in fact the very first rowing almanac gives details of a regatta held in Maidenhead in 1860, and some sources cite that regattas were held annually from 1839 to 1850. Crews and scullers from Maidenhead did compete at various regattas during this intermittent time period, but never seemed to belong to a particular rowing club.\nClub formation\nIn 1876, a letter to the Maidenhead Advertiser questioned why a town with such proximity to the river did not have a rowing club or an annual regatta.\n\"\"To the editor.\"\n\"SIR - The well-timed suggestion of your \"Local Looker-on\" that Maidenhead should have a Town Boating Club is certainly in great part practicable. The members of the Early Closing Association might possibly form such a club, but their only opportunities to practice would be Thursday evenings, and they would probably struggle in preparing a really good crew, and sending them to Marlow or Henley. There is no reason, however, why the many young men in Maidenhead who have both time and means at their disposal should not organise such a club. Indeed, the only wonder is that they have not done it long ago. Many times I have heard visitors express their surprise that Maidenhead, a town for which the river has done so much, should have so little to do for itself. This remark is surely justified by the fact that our river-side town has neither Flower Show nor Regatta. Hoping that you will bring public opinion to bear on this matter.\"\n\"I am, Sir, yours truly.\"\n\"AN EMPLOYER\"\"\nIn response, a group of individuals amassed at the Bear Hotel in Maidenhead, and later in the town hall, with the intention of forming a rowing club. Those present were as follows: Mr Hall-Say, Alderman Durrant, and Messrs Jeffries, H. Clark, Bennett, J.D. Broome, Hammond, J. Burnham, W. Clark, J. Fuller, Baines, Lester, E. Hewitt, Puttick, F. Burnham, Tapley, Britton, Shrewsbury, Jackson, Davey, H. Woodhouse, Blackbow, Baylis, Beal and Aldridge. Club rules and constitution were established, which included references to amateurism (i.e. no member shall row for money prizes etc.) which were in line with what other clubs had at the time. The club colours were originally maroon and gold, but an unknown time later (late 1800s, early 1900s) became the current colours and a five-pointed star became the symbol of the club - presumably a connection was made between the town's original rowing club and the current one and the symbol was 'reinstated'. An annual regatta organised by the club was immediately established and came to be a popular event.\nThe club struggled with success in its first few years, entering the Town Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta in 1878 and 1883, being quickly eliminated. A four had considerable success at local regattas in the late 1890s, and these came more and more often as the club developed.\n1900–present\nThe first big victory for the club came in 1924, where the crew of; R.G. Jackson(b), H.G.E. Woods, J.G. Barley, H.J. Fowlie, S.A. Quarterman, R.R. Waterer, W. Boulton, J.H. Waizeneker(s), A.E. Grenn (c), coached by Capt. H. Booth-Mason won the Thames Challenge Cup at Henley, after a similar crew lost in the final of the same event in 1923. A similar crew then raced the Grand Challenge Cup in 1925, and lost out to London Rowing Club by a mere 5 feet.\nThe success in 1924 prompted for the club to extend its premises. The clubhouse before this was a very small building, with a shed adjacent to it presumably used to store boats. In 1926, Jack Arnold led the construction of a much bigger boathouse adjacent to the original clubhouse - both were sandwiched between Maidenhead Bridge and the Thames Riviera Hotel. This boathouse would serve the club well into the end of the century.\nA second win at Henley came in 1939, where a coxless four featuring; B.C.D. Eastick(b), F.L. Ashton, J.G. Bissett, A.J. Lion(s), coached by S.A. Quarterman, took the Wyfold Challenge Cup, beating Tigre Boat Club, Argentina in the final. This win proved exceptionally popular, as it was one of the few events that year that was won by an English crew. Aubrey Lion, who stroked the four, became president of the club in 1977.\nAt the 1948 Olympics in London, the club's Bert Bushnell teamed up with Leander Club's Richard Burnell to win the double sculls. Their journey to this gold medal, which saw them put together by Jack Beresford only six weeks before the games and included overcoming physical differences in the boat and social differences outside the boat, was retold in the 2012 BBC drama Bert and Dickie. Bushnell was an accomplished sculler, who represented the club well to win the Wingfield Sculls in 1947, as well as finishing runner-up in the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley in 1948, a result that ultimately led to him being selected to race the Olympic double as opposed to the single.\nPost-war, the club was almost annually putting out entries to Henley and other large events, such as the Head of the River Race, as well as more local events.\nIn the mid 1970s, the club admitted its first female member - Laura Lion (née Jenkinson). The rules of the club had to be changed for her to be admitted. Joining as a junior, Laura experienced a successful career in rowing, and is an active member of the club even in the present day. The club is now equally represented in both genders.\nFurther Henley successes came in the 1980s, when the club experienced a golden age of sorts. Eric Sims won the Double Sculls Challenge Cup with Steve Redgrave from Marlow in 1981, and represented Great Britain several times. The Queen Mother Challenge Cup was won in 1984 in a composite with Bewdley. The crew was composed of E.R. Sims(b), J.P. Lawther, J. Ferris, J. Spencer-Jones(s)(Bewdley), coached by Derek Cook. The club's last non-composite win came in 1985, where M.W. Harlow(b), C.A. Shawcross, E.R. Sims, J.P. Lawther(s), Z. Barker(c) and Derek Cook (coach) won the Britannia Challenge Cup. The streak of Henley wins were accompanied by countless wins at the National Championships and a selection of club members representing Great Britain at senior and junior world championships. The last win at Henley for many years came from a composite crew of Maidenhead (B. Webb) and Windsor Boys' School in 1992, in the Fawley Challenge Cup.\nThe success of the 1980s prompted a desire to move to newer premises, with a bigger clubhouse to accommodate the ever-growing membership, and to replace the old clubhouse, which was in poor condition. A huge effort was made by many of the club members in order to secure the funding and planning permission for the new boathouse, including the bid for lottery funding. In 1998 the members of the club moved into a newly built clubhouse, opened by Steve Redgrave. The new building was able to house many more members, boats, and facilities. Membership has more than quadrupled since the move.\nThe new clubhouse and capacity for more membership allowed the club's junior section to flourish. National titles continued to be won, and in 2007 the club had its last Henley win thus far, with P. Clapp taking the Fawley Challenge Cup in a composite with Henley R.C.. Since the win, junior quads from Maidenhead reached the Fawley semi-finals twice (2013 &amp; 2017) and the final in 2018. In 2015 the club won the Victor Ludorum at the British Junior Rowing Championships. Countless national titles/medals and GB Junior representations decorate many of the club's current and alumni members. In recent years wins at Henley Women's Regatta and the Schools Head of the River were also achieved. Maidenhead has been the starting club for more recently successful athletes such as Rob Williams, who won silver in the LM4- at the London 2012 Olympics, and Jack Beaumont, Rio 2016 Olympic finalist.\nIn 2018, adaptive rowing was introduced at the rowing club, complete with accessible facilities and a small squad for current adaptive athletes.\nNotable members.\nNotable past club members include Bert Bushnell, winner of the Wingfield Sculls in 1947 and so far the club's only Olympic gold medallist, winning gold at the 1948 Olympic Games in London in a double with Richard Burnell. William Grenfell, also known as Lord Desborough, was the club's first captain and a very noteworthy individual who among other things competed in the only dead heat Boat Race in 1877, rowed the English channel, served as Mayor of Maidenhead and was chairman of the British Olympic Association.\nEvents.\nThe club hosts the Maidenhead Junior Regatta in the spring, and the Maidenhead Regatta in the summer, both of which attract hundreds of entries from clubs all over the region and even from across the country. The races are 500m upstream on the Bray Reach, finishing by the steps just south of Maidenhead Railway Bridge, although in 2007 the summer regatta was briefly relocated to Dorney Lake due to poor river conditions. Maidenhead Junior Regatta is unique to other local regattas in that it is aimed at young juniors with little or no racing experience, and allows them to race more than once by way of a repechage system, where if a crew loses their first race, they are able to race again and potentially still make the final instead of being knocked out outright. The summer regatta is aimed at more experienced racers, with a traditional knock-out progression system. It is rich in its history, being organised by the club since its formation every year from 1876 (except in wartime), and being raced as early as 1839."

She won a gold medal in 2008 and twice won a bronze medal, in 1996 and 2000. She also claimed the gold medal at the 1999 Pan American Games.\nShe is nicknamed Fofão because of her large cheeks similar to a famous character of a 1980s children's TV program in Brazil named \"Fofão\".\nCareer.\nFofão participated at the 1999 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup. She won the 2006–07 CEV Cup with the Italian club Sirio Perugia and was awarded \"Best Setter\".

        "title": "Colombian Professional Baseball League",
        "text": "The Colombian Professional Baseball League ( or LPB), is a professional baseball league based in Colombia. It is a four-team winter league that plays during the Major League Baseball offseason. In the past, the league's champion has taken part in the Caribbean Series.\nHistory.\nThe history of Colombian professional baseball is commonly divided into three eras: from 1948 to 1958, from 1979 to 1988, and from 1993 to the present.\nProfessional baseball in Colombia has its origins in 1948, when two foreign teams — the Havana Sugar Kings of the Florida State League, and Chesterfield of the Panamanian League — played an exhibition series against the Colombian national team. Shortly thereafter, business interests in Cartagena created the country's two first professional teams: Torices of Cartagena and Indios of Cartagena. Indios would go on to be the league's most successful club in its early years, winning seven championships. The first era of Colombian professional baseball continued until the 1957–58 season, when a national currency devaluation forced it to cease operations. Attempts to organize a new league in 1958 failed to materialize, despite fan interest.\nThe Colombian league returned to operation in 1993 on a semi-pro basis, known as the Copa Kola Román-Davivienda, with seven brand-new teams from different departments of Colombia. In 1994, it returned to a fully professional format, with Caimanes, Vaqueros, and Rancheros returning from the previous era as well as a new team, Tigres, based in Cartagena.\nThe league added two teams for the 2010–11 season, both in non-traditional baseball markets in the country's central regions: Potros, based in Medellín, and Águilas, based in the capital of Bogotá. Additionally, the Toros moved from Sincelejo to Cali for economic reasons. These changes were reversed in the 2012–13 season, after Toros moved back to Sincelejo and the two expansion teams folded.\nThe league again added two new expansion teams for the 2019–2020 season: Gigantes de Barranquilla and Vaqueros de Montería. Vaqueros went on to become league champions in their inaugural season. They would also become the first team to represent Colombia in the Caribbean Series, after the LPB made its debut in the tournament's 2020 edition (replacing the Cuban National Series, which could appear due to visa issues).\nAfter the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the LPB established a \"bubble\" format for the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons, with all games being played in Barranquilla. The pandemic also saw both Leones and Toros withdraw from the league. Gigantes were expected to fold after the 2021–22 season, but managed to return the next year.\nFor the 2022–23 season, the league announced it was considering adding an expansion team in Bolívar. This was confirmed in September, when it was announced that the expansion team would be placed in Cartagena. Getsemaní Leones de La Trinidad, founded in 1933 as an amateur team, had petitioned to join the league for over a year, but their entrance was delayed by COVID-19. However, before the start of the season, the league announced that both Getsemaní and Gigantes would not play due to financial difficulties; instead, Toros returned after a two-year absence, keeping the league at four teams. In 2023, the league announced that Leones and Gigantes would return for the 2023-24 season, bringing the number of teams back to six.\nInternational competition.\nIn 2004, the Colombian Professional Baseball League was provisionally accepted into the Caribbean Professional Baseball Confederation (CPBC). However, the league was not allowed to participate in the Caribbean Series until the level of play and the quality of baseball facilities improved.\nLPB first participated in the Caribbean Series in 2020, and appeared in four editions of the tournament until 2023. In the 2022 Caribbean Series, Caimanes became the first Colombian team to win the championship, defeating the Dominican Republic's Gigantes del Cibao. Despite this victory, controversy ensued when the Colombian league was again denied full membership into the Caribbean Professional Baseball Confederation (CPBC).\nOn April 22, 2023, it was announced that LPB would not participate in the 2024 Caribbean Series; it was dropped from the tournament along with Cuba's Elite League and Panama's PROBEIS league. The Colombian Baseball Federation said that the league refused to pay a $200,000 participation fee to enter as a guest, alleging that it had previously been promised full membership into the CPBC. Instead, the league champion was slated to participate in a new Intercontinental Series organized by the Team Rentería Foundation, to take place in Barranquilla in January 2024; however, that tournament was ultimately canceled\nLeague structure.\nThe league is organized by the Colombian Professional Baseball Division (Diprobéisbol), under the auspices of the Colombian Baseball Federation. The season is played from October to January. The top four teams at the end of the regular season, a first round robin phase of 50 games per team, advance to another round-robin (12 games for every team) with the two best teams contesting a best-of-seven final series to determine the league champion.\nThe league was previously owned by the Renteria Foundation, an organization run by former Major League Baseball shortstop Édgar Rentería. Its president was Edinson Rentería (brother of Édgar), whose management of the league was controversial. Rentería was eventually replaced as the league's administrator by Pedro Salcedo Salom, causing a dispute that has been cited as an issue preventing Colombia's entry to the CPBC.\nPlayers such as former Major League Baseball shortstop Orlando Cabrera have owned teams.\nTeams and stadiums.\nFour teams from the country's Caribbean region compete in the league."

        "title": "Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Qualification",
        "text": "Qualification for tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China was determined not by any form of qualifying tournament, but by the rankings maintained by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA).\nQualifying criteria.\nThe main qualifying criteria were the ATP and WTA ranking lists as of June 9, 2008. The players entering were formally submitted by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The ATP and WTA rankings were based on performances from the previous 52 weeks, and there were several tournaments, including the 2008 Wimbledon Championships, in the two-month period between the time of the rankings being frozen for entry, and the beginning of the tennis events at the Olympics. This led one player, Rainer Schüttler, who rose the ATP rankings considerably in that time period, to successfully seek arbitration on the matter and gain entry. Another player, Tamarine Tanasugarn who was outside the ranking places that could qualify on July 9, but re-entered them, like Schuettler, gained entry; although she did so through the Tripartite Commission Invitation places after Stephanie Vogt withdrew.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter 6 men and 6 women athletes, with a maximum of 4 entries in the individual events, and 2 pairs in the doubles events. This resulted in several high-ranked players being unable to enter, despite players of lower-rank being able to. For example, Vera Zvonareva, world number 13, would not have been entered had all the Russian players ahead of her done so, and world number 21, Nadia Petrova, was unable to participate (the top four Russian women players were all in the world's top eight). In the men's, a notably high-ranked player who could not gain entry was world number 20 Fernando Verdasco of Spain. However, any player in the world's top 56 was eligible, and NOC's had the option to enter players of a lower rank. Athletes were able to compete in both single and doubles events.\nSingles:\nDoubles:\nThe ITF places were allocated by the ITF, based on recognized world ranking and continental/NOC participation.\nSummary.\nA total of 48 nations were represented by at least one player in either the men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, or women's doubles.\nQualifiers.\nMen's singles.\nPR Protected/Special Ranking\nRankings as at 9 June 2008\nSchüttler entry controversy.\nOn August 4, 2008, German player Rainer Schüttler was granted an exceptional entry into the tournament, despite not having qualified under the original criteria, after having taken his campaign to play at the games to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Schuettler, who was an alternate for Denis Gremelmayr, was ranked outside the qualifying places on June 9, when the players entered for the Games, based upon the ATP rankings of that date, were announced by the ITF. Schüttler then went on to the 2008 Wimbledon Championships, where he reached the semi-finals, elevating his ranking from No. 94 to No. 31 in the world. Germany had received one place in the men's singles, based upon the rankings of June 9, although several players withdrew before the Games. Schüttler was subsequently selected by the German Olympic Committee (Deutscher Olympischer Sportbund, DOS), in spite of the regulations set out by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), under which he was designated as an alternate. On August 3, Schüttler took his case to CAS, who the next day ruled in his favour, saying that it was in compliance with the ITF's rules, and asserting that there was an understanding that the decision over which player could be entered would be delegated to the relevant National Olympic Committee. The ITF delivered a hostile response to the decision by CAS, claiming the DOS was ignorant, and admonishing Schüttler's actions — \"While recognising the German NOC may not understand how professional tennis works, there is no excuse for Mr Schuettler, who is prepared to take a place earned by his compatriot Denis Gremelmayr and of next alternate Michael Berrer.\"\nWomen's singles.\nPR Protected/Special Rankings\nRankings as at 9 June 2008\nMen's doubles.\n^ Players have also qualified to the singles tournament\nWomen's doubles.\n^ Players have also qualified to the singles tournament"

Since 2000, FSU has been one of the best programs in college baseball with more victories and a higher winning percentage in the regular season than any other school. FSU made the postseason 44 years in a row, tied for the longest streak in the history of college baseball. FSU also has two 60 win seasons and twenty-four 50 win seasons. FSU has hosted more Super Regional Tournaments than any team in the nation. In 2012, FSU passed Texas for the most all-time wins in regionals and super regionals. In 2014, FSU set the record for the most National Seed selections of all-time. In 2017, FSU defeated Cal-State Fullerton, in the 1,000th College World Series game. From 1948-2022, FSU completed seventy-five consecutive winning seasons, the longest streak in the sport’s history, and was the only college baseball team to have never had a losing record until the 2023 season. \nEarly history (1948–1980).\nThe first coach of the Florida State Seminoles was Charlie Armstrong, who spent four years with the program and compiled a record of 46–29.\nRalph Matherly became the second coach of the Seminoles.

He is the winningest coach in school history and his teams never won less than 40 games a season and reached the postseason in every year of his tenure, advancing to the world series on 17 occasions; in 2017, Martin won his 1900th game, becoming just the second coach in college baseball history to reach that milestone, in 2018, he become the winningest coach in college baseball, and in his final season, he became the first coach in history to win 2,000 games. During his tenure, he had 85 players drafted in the first ten rounds of the MLB Draft including 19 first round picks.\nMike Martin, Jr. era (2020–2022).\nOn June 21, 2019, Mike Martin Jr., a former player and assistant, was named head coach of the Seminoles. He guided Florida State to two appearances in the NCAA tournament during his tenure although the Seminoles were eliminated in the regionals on both occasions. On June 10, 2022, Martin was let go following three seasons, ending forty-three years of a Martin at the helm of the program.\nLink Jarrett era (2023–present).\nOn June 24, 2022, Link Jarrett, a former player under Martin Sr., was named head coach of the Seminoles.

In his second year, he led the Seminoles to their second best start to a season in school history.\nVenue.\nMike Martin Field at Dick Howser Stadium.\nMike Martin Field at Dick Howser Stadium is the home of the Seminoles and is located in Tallahassee, Florida, on the campus of Florida State University. It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of the Florida State Seminoles baseball team. It opened in 1983 and after a two-year, $12 million project was completed in 2004 to make it one of the top collegiate baseball facilities in the United States, upgrading the stadium to a 6,700 capacity level. FSU's record crowd of 6,789 was set on April 19, 2008 with a defeat of then #1 Miami Hurricanes by a score of 9–5.\nTraditions.\nAnimals of Section B.\nBefore the home half of the 5th inning, a group of fans known as 'The Animals of Section B', lead the Seminoles crowd in singing the Canadian national anthem, O Canada. This tradition is claimed to have started on February 13, 1988, during the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, when FSU was playing Grambling State University. During the bottom of the 5th inning, with the score tied 2–2, a member of The Animals began humming the Canadian anthem. As the Seminoles began to rally for more and more runs, more Animals joined in the humming and the team scored eight runs that inning. With baseball being a sport with a long history of superstition, The Animals have maintained the tradition ever since.\nSunday Golds.\nA tradition that began during the Mike Martin era, the Seminoles wear their gold uniforms for every game that they play on a Sunday.\nRecords and results.\nYear-by-year results.\nNote: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, C = Conference\nPolls.\nFlorida State been ranked in the Collegiate Baseball Division I Final Poll 54 times as of the end of the 2021 season.\n\"Top-10 finishes are colored ██\"\nAll-time record vs. ACC teams.\nFlorida State baseball maintains a winning record against all current ACC teams.\nFlorida State in the NCAA tournament.\nFlorida State has appeared in the NCAA tournament a total of 59 times () the second most appearances of any team in history.

        "title": "1958 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1958 followed a system established after the 1956 election. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players; they elected no one. The BBWAA was voting only in even-number years, with the Veterans Committee meeting only in odd-numbered years to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, and executives. For the first time since , the induction ceremonies in Cooperstown, New York, were canceled because there was no one to induct, the second such occurrence in Hall of Fame history.\nBBWAA election.\nSeveral elements of the current procedure were put into effect. There was a printed list of eligible candidates, all of whom had played in at least ten major league seasons. Only 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote, and they were instructed to vote for \"up to\" ten candidates rather than ten. The latter revision resulted from complaints by many writers in 1956 that there were no longer many viable candidates, a situation which had been caused partly by changes governing candidate eligibility.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1928 or later but not after 1952, a 25-year span of major league finales. (In a change, they were permitted to be active in non-playing roles.) The Hall of Fame would induct any candidate who received at least 75% support, as always, which was 200 votes on 266 ballots returned. A total of 2,400 individual votes were cast, an average of 9.02 per ballot.\nThere were about 400 players on the new ballot and about 154 received at least one vote. A dagger (†) marks candidates who last played in 1951 or 1952. Under the new rules they would have been on the ballot for the first time, alone among the candidates who received votes, but this was the first ballot with a list of players. Candidates who have been inducted subsequently are named in \"italics\".\nWith many strong candidates but none who particularly stood out, many players received support but none were elected; while 27 players received between 10% and 40%, only two received more than 40%. Max Carey's 51.1% remains the lowest percentage for a top vote getter in a BBWAA election."

        "title": "James Ward (tennis)",
        "text": "James Ward (born 9 February 1987) is a British former professional tennis player. He is a Davis Cup champion and former British No. 2.\nHe reached the quarterfinals of the 2010 Aegon International and the semifinals of the 2011 Aegon Championships as a wildcard entry. His best Grand Slam performance to date was reaching the third round of Wimbledon in 2015.\nIn February 2009, Ward played what was then, the longest tennis match in history, lasting 6 hrs 40 mins, eventually losing to Chris Eaton. This was a play-off match to decide the Davis Cup team, but it was not sanctioned by the ATP so was not an official record, and it was broken later.\nWard was part of the Great Britain team that won the Davis Cup in 2015, the nation's first success in the tournament for 79 years. He played in wins against the United States and France in the first round and quarterfinals, which included a crucial singles victory over US' John Isner to give Britain a 2–0 lead. Ward was also named in the team for the Davis Cup final, and the Davis Cup team won the 2015 BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award.\nEarly and personal life.\nWard is the son of Jim Ward, a London black cab taxi driver. Ward started playing tennis at around 10 because his father played some social tennis every weekend at Temple Fortune Club in Hendon. Ward also played football, but chose tennis. The club didn't have a junior programme and because coaches costs money, Ward only played once a week.\nWard would often be found at the Islington Tennis Centre in Market Road. During his early teenage years Ward was coached by Daren Quilty, Head Pro at Oakleigh Park Tennis Club in Whetstone, culminating in him reaching the semifinals of the Under-15s national championships.\nAfter finishing his GCSEs at the age of 16, his entire family relocated to Spain so that Ward could attend the Equelite Juan Carlos Ferrero Academy near Valencia for four years, where he practised with former French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero. In 2007, Ward's father fell ill, causing a downturn in their finances, but the academy allowed Ward to stay.\nWard enjoys playing on clay more than any other surface and currently trains in London.\nWard is famous for wearing colourful tennis shirts, after forming a bond with London designer Ted Baker, otherwise known as Ray Kelvin.\nWard is a fan of Arsenal F.C. At one time, Ward was so strapped for cash he had to sell his Gunners season ticket to help pay for his tennis career.\nCareer.\nHe made his first tour appearance in Valencia in 2007 as a wild card but lost in the first round.\nWard qualified for only his second ATP tour event, the 2008 Stella Artois Championships at the Queen's Club in London. In the first round on 9 June he met former US Open and Australian Open champion, Russian player Marat Safin. Ward took the first set after breaking Safin in the third game of the match and managed to hold his serve for the rest of the set to take it 6–4. However Safin upped his game in the second set, gained an early break and won the set comfortably 6–1. Ward was also broken early in the deciding set losing 6–4, 1–6, 4–6.\n2009.\nIn February, Davis Cup captain John Lloyd selected six Britons for a play-off contest, to find two singles players for the Ukraine tie. In these, Ward competed in a then longest match in tennis history, lasting 6 hours and 40 minutes, against Chris Eaton on 25 February. Eaton won the match 6–3, 6–2, 6–7, 2–6, 21–19, but it was not sanctioned by the ATP so was not an official record. It was exceeded later by the Isner-Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships. This was the second time that Ward had played a five set match – the first occasion had been the previous Monday also at the play-offs.\nIn May, he became the first British player to win a challenger title on clay since Tim Henman in 1995. He beat Carsten Ball in the final of the Sarasota Open in Florida, USA. This win propelled him into the top 250 of the ATP's rankings, establishing himself as British No. 2.\nIn September, Ward was struck with glandular fever, and dropped to British No. 3.\n2010.\nIn March, Ward made his Davis Cup debut in the Europe/Africa Zone Group II tie vs Lithuania, in Vilnius, with Dan Evans, Ken Skupski, and Colin Fleming. The Lithuanian side entered the tie as underdogs; fielding a team of teenagers. Ward beat Lithuanian No. 2 Laurynas Grigelis and became the first Briton other than Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski, or Andy Murray to win a live rubber since Andrew Richardson beat Zimbabwe's Byron Black in 1997. Evans lost the second singles match, Fleming and Skupski won their doubles, but Ward and Evans were both beaten on the final day. This was described as a humiliating Davis Cup defeat for Great Britain and led to the resignation of Davis Cup captain John Lloyd. Britain was then threatened with relegation to the third tier of the competition.\nTommy Peric became Ward's coach.\nIn June 2010, Ward reached his first ATP World Tour quarterfinal at the Aegon International, Eastbourne, UK. Ward beat second seed Feliciano López (who had beaten Rafael Nadal the week before) when López had to retire. He followed it up with a victory over the other man to lose at the semifinals of Queens the week before, Rainer Schüttler. He was eventually beaten by the young Ukrainian talent Alexandr Dolgopolov in straight sets.\nThe new Davis Cup captain Leon Smith selected Ward to take part in Great Britain's vital Davis Cup tie vs Turkey at Eastbourne in July alongside Jamie Baker, Ken Skupski, Colin Fleming, and Alex Ward (non-player). Defeat would have meant Great Britain's relegation to Europe Zone Group III. Ward contributed to the victory by winning both his singles matches, Britain eventually winning 5–0, and giving Great Britain a first Davis Cup win in three years.\nAt the Delhi Commonwealth Games in October, Ward became the first Englishman to play tennis in a Commonwealth Games. Seeded fourth in the singles, he beat Jamie Murray in the second round to reach the quarterfinals.\n2011.\nWard lost at the first hurdle in six of his seven tournaments at the beginning of this year.\nSo when Leon Smith, Britain's Davis Cup captain selected his team for the Euro/Africa Zone Group II tie against Tunisia in March, he sprang a surprise, omitting Alex Bogdanovic, having recalled the 26-year-old to the squad after a three-year absence. Instead, Smith's singles players were Ward (No. 214) and Jamie Baker (No. 406), who had lost first time out in his last two events. Although Bogdanovic (No. 374) had lost all six of his live Davis Cup rubbers, he had at least won a Futures tournament in the United States that year. Ward played a key role in Great Britain's 4–1 victory, winning both his live singles rubbers, and ultimately clinching the tie by beating Malek Jaziri 3–6, 6–3, 3–6, 6–3, 8–6 in the fourth rubber.\nAt the Queen's Club Championships, Ward reached the semifinals of an ATP tour event for the first time. He defeated fourth seed and future Grand Slam champion Stanislas Wawrinka in straight sets in the second round. Ward followed this up by defeating defending champion and 13th seed Sam Querrey, coming from a set down to win in three sets to equal his run at Eastbourne in 2010. Ward then defeated Adrian Mannarino in three sets, despite missing seven match points in the second-set tiebreaker. He was eventually defeated by Jo Wilfried Tsonga, having held a set point in the second-set tiebreaker. This was the first time two British players had reached this stage since the Open era began in 1968, the other man being Andy Murray.\nAt Wimbledon Ward entered as a wildcard, but lost in the first round to Michaël Llodra.\nIn July, Ward took part in the Davis Cup Luxembourg tie. Ward could not make good a ranking deficit of 106 places against world No. 81 Gilles Müller, and he lost the first rubber. Great Britain won 4–1, with Ward winning the dead rubber against unranked Laurent Bram, a full-time coach who played competitively when he could.\nFollowing a short break, Ward's first tournament back was the Lexington Challenger. As top seed, Ward reached the final, losing to Wayne Odesnik. He was also runner-up in the doubles tournament. Two weeks later, Ward won the second Challenger tournament of his career at the 2011 Odlum Brown Vancouver Open, defeating Robby Ginepri. The win saw Ward rise to world No. 144. On 15 August ward rose to a career-high ranking of No. 140.\nIn September, Ward was selected for the Davis Cup promotion tie against Hungary. In the first rubber, Ward had a sometimes dramatic win over the visitors' No. 1 Attila Balázs. The drama came not so much from any searing quality of tennis, but from Ward's constant battle with cramping in his leg and queasiness that meant he had to nip backstage mid-match to empty the contents of his stomach. Ward had occasionally looked likely to default against an opponent ranked No. 262 in the world. With Andy Murray, Colin Fleming, and Ross Hutchins winning, Great Britain claimed a decisive 3–0 lead, and was promoted into Europe/Africa Zone Group I.\n2012.\nWard qualified for his first Grand Slam other than Wimbledon, but lost in the first round of the Australian Open to Slovenian Blaž Kavčič.\nIn February, Ward participated in the Davis Cup Europe/Africa Zone Group I tie against Slovakia. Though he lost his singles rubbers, Great Britain won 3–2.\nWard suffered from a back injury and was unable to play in the Davis Cup tie against Belgium.\nOn 30 April, Ward reached a career-high ranking in singles of No. 137.\nEntering Wimbledon on a wild card, Ward won his first match at a Grand Slam, coming through a grueling five-set match to defeat the World no. 36 Pablo Andújar. He won the final six games after trailing in the final set 0–3. In the second round on Court No 1, Ward narrowly lost to World no 12 Mardy Fish in another tough five-setter, and received a standing ovation.\nWard had recently sold his £1300 Arsenal F.C. season ticket to fund his tennis, so he had some regrets after earning £23,125 for winning his first round Wimbledon match.\nIn July, Ward fell over in Newport practising, breaking his wrist, and putting him out for six months. His ranking fell from No. 140 to No. 280.\nIn December, the Lawn Tennis Association announced that Ward was the only player in Britain's top nine men to be funded for the following season.\n2013.\nIn January 2013, Ward failed to qualify for the Australian Open, reaching the third round of qualifying before losing to Julian Reister. Ward remained in Australia to compete in the Charles Sturt Adelaide International, where he reached the final, defeating top seed Yūichi Sugita along the way, before losing to home favourite Matthew Barton.\nWard was then selected for Great Britain's Davis Cup team for their Europe/Africa Zone Group I match against Russia in Coventry. Ward lost an epic first rubber to Evgeny Donskoy to give Russia a 2–0 lead heading into the doubles rubber the following day. The doubles pairing of Jonny Marray and Colin Fleming gave the home side some hope going into the final day of matches, where Ward opened the day. Ward stunned the much higher seeded Russian Dmitry Tursunov to level the tie. Dan Evans would eventually complete a remarkable turnaround, with a straight-set victory over Donskoy. The last time Great Britain had come from 2–0 down to win a Davis Cup tie was 83 years ago against Germany, Consequently, Great Britain won a place in the 16-team World Group play-offs in September. Ward had to be placed on a drip to help him recover from his efforts. The following Monday afternoon, Ward was not feeling well so he was again put on a drip.\nWard kicked off his clay season in China, where he qualified for the An-Ning ATP $50,000 Challenger event and reached the final. His route to the final included a victory over fourth seed Josselin Ouanna. He lost to Hungarian Márton Fucsovics in the final.\nWard's first grass tournament was the annual event at Queen's Club, where he lost in the first round to Ivan Dodig, despite having two match points on serve in the second set.\nIn July, Ward won his third Challenger title at Lexington, USA.\nIn November, the Lawn Tennis Association announced a dramatic cut in elite player funding, with all financial support being withdrawn from Britain's doubles specialists and any singles players aged over 24, such as Ward, to reduce the number of supported players from 16 to just six in 2014.\nAndy Murray asked Ward to stay at his training camp in Miami for December, but Ward made a last-minute decision to stay home.\n2014.\nWard started 2014 in Brisbane, competing in the Brisbane International, losing in the second round of qualifying to Marius Copil in three sets. Ward then went on to the Australian Open, where he disappointingly lost in the first round of qualifying to Andrea Arnaboldi. Soon after, Ward competed in the Maui Challenger, a common tournament for those who failed to make the Australian Open main draw. However, Ward once again lost disappointingly in the first round against Denis Kudla.\nIn late January, Ward was called to the Great British Davis Cup squad for the World Group first round tie against the United States in San Diego and was chosen to play the second rubber against world No. 49 Sam Querrey. Ward was two games from defeat in the fourth set before producing a remarkable comeback to beat Querrey in five sets and increase Great Britain's lead to 2–0. Ward agreed that it was the greatest win of his career.\nGreat Britain would later go on to win the tie 3–1, with Andy Murray securing two victories; Ward was scheduled to play the final rubber against Donald Young but both teams decided not to play.\nWard entered the Open BNP Paribas Banque de Bretagne as a sixth seed. However, he lost in the first round of 32 against Maxime Authom. Moving on to the Open 13, Ward entered qualifying and fought his way to the third and final round. However, he lost to Ričardas Berankis, ending his progress in the tournament. He had more success in the Dubai Tennis Championships, entering as a wild card into the main draw. In the first round of 32, Ward beat Teymuraz Gabashvili in three sets in order to advance to the second round of 16. There, he lost to sixth seed, Mikhail Youzhny, earning nearly $25,000 in the progress. Ward also entered the Qualifying tournament at the BNP Paribas Open. At Indian Wells, Ward progressed to the second Qualifying Round, but lost to Paul-Henri Mathieu in straight sets. However, taking advantage of the withdrawal, Ward received a wild card into the main draw in place of the sixth seed Juan Martín del Potro, thus earning a Bye in the first round of 128. Despite losing in the Round of 64 to Feliciano López, Ward once again earned around $16,000.\nEntering the Visit Panamá Cup main draw directly, Ward lost to Gastão Elias in the first round. Moving on, Ward was once again called into the Davis Cup squad, to compete against Italy. Ward competed in two live rubbers in the tie, losing hard-fought battles against both Fabio Fognini and Andreas Seppi. Due to Fognini's win over Andy Murray, Italy won the tie 3–2.\nWard qualified for the French Open for the first time thanks to victories over Moldovan Radu Albot in the first round of qualifying, and over American Ryan Harrison in the second. He followed this up with a tense victory over Slovenian Blaz Rola in the final round. By doing so, Ward became the first British player to progress through qualifying for the French Open since John Lloyd in 1973. He eventually lost in the main draw first round to Radu Albot.\nIn December, Ward and Kyle Edmund trained with Andy Murray at his training camp in Miami for two and a half weeks.\n2015: Davis Cup Champion.\nIn January, Ward joined Andy Murray's training camp in Dubai.\nWard played at the invitational Kooyong Classic in Melbourne, beating American No 1 John Isner 3–6, 7–6, 6–2 in an exhibition match.\nAt the Australian Open, Ward was named as the sixth alternate on the main entry list. but a number of withdrawals meant that Ward joined the main draw and did not need to qualify. Ward became the first British male singles player other than Andy Murray to earn direct entry into a Grand Slam since Tim Henman at the 2007 US Open. Ward played 31st seed Fernando Verdasco in the first round, losing 2–6 6–0 7–6 (8–6) 6–3.\nIn March, Ward was selected for the Davis Cup first round tie against the United States in Glasgow, pulling off the biggest win of his career. Ward, ranked 111 in the world, came from two sets down to beat 20th-ranked John Isner 6–7 (5–7) 5–7 6–3 7–6 (7–3) 15–13 in a match which surpassed the five-hour mark, to set Great Britain on their way to victory. The last time Great Britain won back-to-back Davis Cup matches against the US, was 80 years ago.\nWard made it into the third round of Wimbledon for the first time, where he was knocked out by Vasek Pospisil 4–6 6–3 6–2 3–6 6–8. Along with Andy Murray, there were two British men in the third round for the first time since 2002. After Wimbledon, he was ranked in the top 100 players for the first time, reaching a career-high ranking of 89.\nHe was also part of the team for the Davis Cup quarter final against France. Ward lost to Gilles Simon, the world No 11, but Great Britain won 3–1 to qualify for the Davis Cup semi-final.\nSince Wimbledon, Ward suffered nine successive defeats, but was announced for the Davis Cup team in the semi-final against Australia in Glasgow. The Davis Cup captain, Leon Smith, eventually made the surprise decision to give the 300 ranked Dan Evans the second singles position along with Andy Murray. Though Dan Evans lost his rubber, Great Britain won 3–2 and reached the Davis Cup Final for the first time since 1978.\nIn October, Ward won his fourth Challenger title in Bangalore, defeating top seed Adrian Menendez-Maceiras 6–2, 7–5 to clinch his first title on the Challenger Tour since July 2013.\n After a disastrous loss of form during the summer, Ward had been under threat of dropping outside the world's top 200 by the end of the year, but his success ensured a ranking of 143. Ward then made it an eight match winning streak by reaching the semi-finals of the Pune Challenger. This success led to Ward being made the Aegon Player of the Month for October.\nDavis Cup Captain Leon Smith supervised Ward and Kyle Edmund, accompanying them to South America to help him decide on his second singles player for the Davis Cup Final. In November, the 20-year-old Edmund won the Copa Fila Challenge title in Argentina on clay beating Brazil's Carlos Berlocq, ranked No 112 in the world and an expert on the red stuff. Ward lost in the second round of the same event, though Ward, ranked 156, had won the hard court Bangalore Challenger. On the same day as Edmund's victory, Dan Evans, ranked 271, won the Knoxville Challenger on a hard court, but with Belgium opting to stage the tie on an indoor clay court, Smith chose to go with the British number two Edmund, now ranked 100, as his second singles player.\nWard, Kyle Edmund, Jamie Murray and Andy Murray were chosen for the 2015 Davis Cup Final versus Belgium in Ghent.\nEdmund made his Davis Cup debut in the 2015 final playing the first singles match against Belgian Number 1 David Goffin, ranked No 16, but lost 6–3, 6–1, 2–6, 1–6, 0–6. There were suggestions that Smith would replace Edmund with the more experienced Ward if the final was locked at 2–2 on Sunday, yet Smith indicated that he could stick with Edmund. Great Britain went on to lead 3–1, and win the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936.\nAfter returning home, Ward revealed that his coach, Australian Darren Tandy, was seriously ill with cancer and that had brought an end to their working relationship. Tandy received an initial diagnosis of colon cancer during the post-Wimbledon tournaments in America, and suffered a stroke while they were together at the US Open together. Ward said 'I am not using it as an excuse for what happened after Wimbledon but obviously it did not help. The most important thing is Darren's health and it has been an upsetting and worrying situation.'\nOn 4 December, Ward booked his first practice session with his new coach Morgan Phillips, a former British player from Croydon, and one of his best friends.\nWard joined the rest of the Davis Cup team at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Show, where they won the 2015 Team of the Year Award.\n2016.\nWard's best results this year were quarter final appearances at the Tallahassee Challenger and the Manchester Challenger\nWard failed to qualify for the Australian Open, French Open and US Open, and was beaten in the first or second round of two ATP and nine Challenger tournaments, plus five ATP Qualifiers. Ward had to cope with recurring tendonitis in his right knee, and the death of his coach.\nEntering Wimbledon on a wildcard, Ward's first round match was against world no 1 Novak Djokovic on Centre Court. Initially losing 0–6, 0–3, whilst not winning a single point in the first set, Ward came back to take the second set to a tie-break, but was eventually beaten 0–6, 6–7, 4–6.\nAfter Wimbledon, Ward was due to play an ATP qualifier, but six hours before his flight to the US, he was called up for the Davis Cup quarter final against Serbia in Belgrade, to cover the absence of Andy Murray, and Dan Evans who had a shoulder problem and some problems at home. Persistent rain during Kyle Edmund's successful match meant that Ward had to play the second singles on Saturday. Dušan Lajović, world no 81 and the Serbian number one in the absence of Novak Djokovic and Viktor Troicki beat Ward heavily in a straight sets victory to make it 1-1. With Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot winning the doubles and Kyle Edmund victorious over Dusan Lajovic, Great Britain won 3–1 to progress to the Davis Cup semi final.\nWard's last match of the year was in September at the St Petersburg Open first round qualifier.\nHis ranking fell from 156 in January to 444 by the end of the year.\n2017.\nAfter an eight-month absence due to a knee problem, Ward returned in June for the British grass court season, but lost five first round matches, including Wimbledon where he had received a wild card.\nRetirement.\nWard announced his retirement from professional tennis on 17 December 2021.\nWorld TeamTennis.\nWard played his first season with World TeamTennis in 2019 debuting with the San Diego Aviators but finishing up with the Orange County Breakers after a rare trade during the team's playoff push. He is set to join the Orlando Storm during the 2020 season scheduled to begin July 12."

        "title": "British Universities Ice Hockey Association",
        "text": "The British Universities Ice Hockey Association was founded during the spring term 2003 by a group of hockey players from the universities of Oxford, London, Nottingham and Newcastle.\nHistory of the BUIHA.\nThe British Universities Ice Hockey Association, or BUIHA, was formed in response to the growing number of universities with ice hockey programmes in an effort to provide students with competitive ice hockey whilst at university, no matter what their level of play.\nThe notion to form the BUIHA first arose in Easter 2003. The idea was to simply form a divisional competition for the existing university teams. Development over the summer of 2003 led to a committee being put in place, a schedule being set and a number of teams signed up to take part in the first ever BUIHA University Cup. The National Championships was already an existing competition. Indeed, the 2003/04 formative season finished in style at the National Championships weekend where the then 13 member teams battled it out for The Rawlinson Plate &amp; The Hopkins Plate.\nThe following season, to further the BUIHA objective of progression at all levels of the sport, the BUIHA introduced Division 3. Also joining the BUIHA in its second season were a number of new university teams, a number that would be again bolstered in its 3rd season, bringing the total teams for 2005-6 to 29.\nThe 2008/09 Season saw the Bristol Lions enter for the 1st time. The sole new entrant in the 2009/10 season were the newly formed Kent Knights, who arrived on the scene with an old friend lining up in a Knights roster. It was the time that Old Skool had ended his association with Imperial College Devils and was playing for his University for the very first time. The 2010/11 season saw the Oxford Women's Blues join their Cambridge counterparts in Division 3 South, and in 2012 we saw a team from St Andrews enter the National Championships in Tier II.\nIn the 2012/13 there was a change in cup competition structure, with Division 3 becoming Non-checking Division 1, and the addition of a third checking division. New teams joined the competition from UCL and University of East Anglia, and a reformed Northumbria team joined as the Kings. Unfortunately, the season started without the return of teams from Bristol and Huddersfield.\n2013/14 Season saw the Birmingham Eagles finally gain recognition for their Students Guild, part of the deal saw the club rebranded as the Birmingham Lions to fall inline with the other sports clubs at the university.\nThe National Championships.\nThe then secretary of the Oxford Vikings, Alexis Rawlinson, came up with the idea of organising a tournament for all the university ice hockey teams in the UK. At the time this was not such a daunting organisational prospect, given that there were only seven teams.\nA few weeks later five teams (blues squads were not invited as they were above the standard of all other teams) gathered for a late night ice hockey session at Oxford Ice Rink starting at 11 pm and running all the way through to the morning. The result of this was a narrow Newcastle victory by one point over the Oxford Vikings. Newcastle arranged the next two events at the National Ice Centre (NIC) in Nottingham, which saw victories for Newcastle in 2002 and London in 2003.\nFor 2004, to recognise the contribution of Alexis to British University Ice Hockey, the top National Championship trophy was renamed the Rawlinson Plate.\n2004 also saw the introduction of a 2nd Tier of competition due to the introduction of many new teams. The BUIHA is now host of a range of new teams from England, Scotland and Wales as well as the original seven that entered the first national championships in 2001. From 2005 onwards tier II was renamed The Hopkins Plate. From the start of the 2015 season onwards the Tier 3 national championship trophy is to be renamed the Miller Trophy to honour the ongoing work the chairman, Andrew Miller, puts into the job.\nThe Cup competition.\nCreated in Autumn 2003 by the founding BUIHA committee the cup competition was envisioned as a league type competition available to university clubs in the UK.\nOperating within the EIHA recreational section the clubs involved played a round robin format with the winner being declared at the end of the season as the team with the most points (using goal difference as a tie breaker).\nFounding clubs of the initial two divisions (in alphabetical order) were:\nDivision 1\nDivision 2\nFrom the 2008/2009 season the BUIHA operated directly under the EIHA board after being awarded a section of their own and separating from the Rec section. This has led to several improvements to the way the organisation can operate.\nTeam Great Britain.\nLaunched at the end of the 2004–5 season, Team Great Britain is the national university side that will compete against other national university sides, including competing at the bi-annual FISU World University Games. Mike Urquhart &amp; Matt Bradbury have agreed to coach the team. Any person attending university anywhere in the world who is a UK &amp; Northern Ireland citizen between the ages of 17 and 28 is able to play for the team. This disregards the level to which they have played the sport."

All coxless fours and coxless quad sculls are named Adelaide and similarly, the Club's coxed eights are named I'Zingari in honour of the Club's original name. These boats then have Roman numerals affixed after their names to denote how many boats have acquired that name.\nCompetition &amp; Regattas.\nAdelaide Rowing Club is affiliated with the South Australian Rowing Association (SARA) and competes in local and interstate regattas on a regular basis.\nA number of members have been selected to represent Australia at:\nClub members compete at the Australian Rowing Championships, administered by Rowing Australia each year.\nAdelaide Rowing Club members often comprise a large component of the South Australian State Rowing Team that contest the following regattas:\nCrews from the Club regularly travel to Melbourne to contest the Head of the Yarra regatta in November of each year, as well as the numerous country regattas that are held at various locations in South Australia, including Berri, Renmark, Murray Bridge and Mannum.\nThe Adelaide Rowing Club has dominated the SARA Senior Men's Premiership in recent years, winning in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.\nThe Club hosts one SARA Premiership regatta each season, the ARC Twilight regatta and traditionally, this has been the regatta closest to Christmas.

The ground overlooks Goodwood House and is owned by the Duke of Richmond and Gordon.\nIt is thought to be one of the oldest cricket clubs in the world. A receipt for brandy in 1702, held at Goodwood House, records the first reference to cricket at Goodwood. Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, known as \"the Duke who was Cricket\", was a leader in developing the game around Sussex. His enthusiasm was continued by Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond who was one of the original backers of Thomas Lord, founder of Lord's Cricket Ground. Teams that have come under the auspices of Goodwood Cricket are the Duke of Richmond's XI, Lord March's XI, the Goodwood Cricket Club XIs and the Goodwood Staff XI. The cricket club was resurrected by the 4th Duke in 1813.\nIn August 1826, the \"Hampshire Telegraph and Naval Chronicle\" reported that \"[a] Grand Match of Cricket was played in Goodwook Park, yesterday, by Lord Dunwich and ten Noblemen and Gentlemen, visitors at Goodwood House, against eleven of the Goodwood Cricket Club for 500 sovereigns\", with the club members winning by a score of 157 to 150.\nToday, Goodwood CC is run by a group of volunteers. The Club formed an alliance in 2017 with Chichester Priory Park CC, whose 1st and 2nd XIs play at the ground on Saturdays. A 31-metre Lebanon Cedar tree overlooks the club.

Princeton's Greg Waller won the overtime faceoff, with Moe retrieving the ground ball and sprinting down the right side for the winning goal. A misplayed clear by Princeton's goalie allowed Tom Marechek to score a virtually empty net goal with 42 seconds left in regulation to tie it.\nOnly five years before this championship, Princeton had just two wins with thirteen losses."

        "text": "Mark Bell (born 19 March 1967) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s.\nHe played for Canberra, Western Suburbs, Penrith, and St. George in Australia, along with a spell with English club Wigan Warriors in the Super League as a wing or centre.\nCareer.\nA Canberra junior with Yass and Belconnen United, Bell made his début for the Raiders from the bench in 1988, but it was to be his only appearance for the club that year. The following year, he played his first game in the starting line-up, scoring a try against Manly at Brookvale Oval.\nBell was named on the bench without playing in the match for both the 1989 and 1990 Grand Finals. However, he played centre in the 1991 Grand Final loss to Penrith.\nBell joined the Magpies in 1992 under coach Warren Ryan. He had an immediate impact, scoring tries in his first 4 matches. He scored 16 tries throughout the year to be the season's highest try-scorer (equal with Tim Brasher).\nAfter an unsuccessful season with the Panthers in 1994, during which he played only 7 games, Bell joined the St George Dragons. He was with the club for 3 seasons, scoring 24 tries. He scored 4 tries in the 1996 semi-final series and played on the wing in the 1996 Grand Final loss to Manly.\nBell played a final season with Wigan in 1998's Super League III. Wigan lost only one match that year, and Bell played wing in the side, winning the 1998 Super League Grand Final, beating the Leeds Rhinos 10–4. \nBell still lives and works in the Canberra region. He has coached local teams Queanbeyan Kangaroos and the Yass Magpies."

It was clear though on Thursday that Robert Karlsson and Jeev Milkha Singh would share the 18-hole lead after shooting matching 68s. Sergio García, still looking for his first major championship, headed up a group of five that shot one-under 69s. Phil Mickelson shot an even-par 70 to place him in an eight-way tie for eighth. Retief Goosen appeared to be piecing together a fabulous opening round when he birdied four of his first seven holes to get to -4. His fortunes would change, however, as he shot six-over the rest of the way to drop four strokes off the lead after the first day. Like Goosen, 2008 Open Champion, Pádraig Harrington, got off to a flying start by birdieing his first three holes. Unfortunately for him, he shot four-over the rest of the way to finish his round with a 71. Kenny Perry was forced to withdraw due to the effects of an eye problem that began plaguing him earlier in the week.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 8, 2008\"\nAt the midway point of the 90th PGA Championship, the only golfer under par was J. B. Holmes. Holmes, whose best finish at a major was a tie for 25th at the Masters earlier in 2008, shot a two-under 68 to post a -1 after 36 holes. He was as many as three shots under par for the tournament, but bogeyed two of his final four holes. Ben Curtis and Justin Rose shared the best round of the day with three-under 67s to settle into a tie for second at even par with Charlie Wi. After withdrawing from the Open Championship, 2001 PGA Championship winner, David Toms, regained his form by shooting a one-under 69 to put himself in a tie for fifth with Henrik Stenson. Sergio García shot a three-over 73 to place himself in a seven way tie for seventh. García appeared as if he would be higher on the leaderboard at the close of the day, but he double-bogeyed the 17th hole. Phil Mickelson bogeyed two of his final four holes to finish in a seven way tie for 14th going into the weekend.\nSeventy-three golfers would survive the cut which was set at 148 (+8). The winner at Bridgestone the previous week and world #4, Vijay Singh, was the most notable golfer to miss the cut when he five-putted his last hole. World #8, Adam Scott, world #9, Stewart Cink, 2007 PGA Championship runner-up, Woody Austin, and 2008 Masters champion, Trevor Immelman, were also among those who missed the cut.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 9, 2008\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Sunday, August 10, 2008\"\nAt 2:16 pm EDT, scattered thunderstorms halted play before the leaders had a chance to begin their round. It appeared as if some golf was going to be played Saturday afternoon, but around 6:30 pm play was officially suspended for the day due to the persistent threat of thunderstorms. Andrés Romero was among those who had the chance to complete their round, and he posted a tournament low, five-under 65 to finish three strokes off the lead.\nThird round play resumed Sunday at 7:15 am. The 2003 Open Champion, Ben Curtis stormed into the lead with birdies at four of his first six holes, and despite a bogey at the 18th hole, Curtis shot two-under 68 for a one stroke lead after 54 holes. Second round leader J. B. Holmes remained in contention with an even par 70 to place himself in a tie for second with Henrik Stenson. 2007 and 2008 Open Champion, Pádraig Harrington shot a four-under 66 to shoot up the leaderboard into a tie for fourth. Also among those at +1 was Sergio García, who shot a one-under 69. South Korean, Charlie Wi shot a one-over 71 to place himself in the three way tie for fourth. Andrés Romero, who completed his round Saturday, woke up much higher on the leaderboard as his five-under 65 put him four strokes off the lead and in a tie for seventh. Former PGA Champions David Toms and Phil Mickelson sat five and six strokes off the lead respectively.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 10, 2008\"\nWith the third round concluding Sunday morning due to the thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon, the final round began at 12:30 pm EDT, in groups of three on split tees: the top half of the remaining field began at the first hole, and the remainder started at the tenth.\nPádraig Harrington claimed his second consecutive major championship and third in the last six majors, two strokes ahead of runners-up Ben Curtis and Sergio García. Harrington shot his second straight 66 (−4), and like his victory three weeks earlier at Royal Birkdale, he won with tremendous play on the back nine. Harrington birdied three of four holes at one point to erase a three-stroke deficit. He made three critical putts at each of the final three holes to seal the victory, which included an par putt on the 72nd hole to make García's upcoming par putt meaningless. Harrington became the first European since 1930 to win the PGA Championship, and only the fourth golfer to win the Open Championship and PGA Championship in the same year.\nGarcía flew out of the gate with a birdie and eagle on the first two holes. He went the first 15 holes without registering a bogey allowing him to play with the lead most of the day. However, his fortunes would change when he found the water at the 16th hole. He would lose sole ownership of the lead on this hole, and ultimately the tournament after failing to match the crucial putts made by Harrington. This marked the second time that Garcia has lost a major to Harrington going down the stretch after his playoff defeat to Harrington at the 2007 Open Championship. Curtis held at least a share of the lead until he bogeyed the final two holes on the front nine. He would come back and tie García briefly for the lead when he birdied the 14th hole. Curtis even found a way to earn par on the 16th despite his drive landing on the platform in front of a hospitality tent. However, he bogeyed two of his final four holes to finish two strokes off the lead.\nCamilo Villegas had his best major finish with a tie for fourth, which was his second top 10 finish at the 2008 majors. He backed up his 67 earlier in the third round with a two-under 68 to finish four strokes behind Harrington. J. B. Holmes, who was one shot back to start the final round, triple bogeyed the first hole en route to an 11-over-par 81. Henrik Stenson had his second straight top 5 at the majors despite shooting a two-over 72 to fall into a tie with Villegas. Steve Flesch found the cup from the fairway on the 18th to become the first on the day to birdie the hole. He finished by himself in sixth place and recorded his second top 10 finish at the majors in 2008. Phil Mickelson birdied three of his first four holes to put himself in contention, but did not birdie another hole and fell into a tie for seventh with Andrés Romero. Romero was unable to back up the 65 he shot in the third round and never mustered up a challenge for the leaders.\nComplete leaderboard \nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;\nTelevision.\nTelevision coverage was provided in the United States by CBS and TNT and on Sky Sports in the UK and Ireland.

        "title": "History of baseball in Allentown, Pennsylvania",
        "text": "The history of professional baseball in Allentown, Pennsylvania dates back 138 years, starting with the formation of the Allentown Dukes in 1884 and continuing through the present with its hosting of the Allentown-based Lehigh Valley IronPigs, the Triple-A Minor League affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball, who play at Coca-Cola Park on the city's East Side.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nProfessional baseball premiered in Allentown in 1884, when the Allentown Dukes completed one season in the original Eastern League. Four years later, the city fielded a Central League team, the Allentown Peanuts, which also folded after a season.\nIn the 1890s, a series of baseball clubs emerged in the city. The Allentown Colts played in the Pennsylvania State League from 1892–93. The next year, the team became Kelly's Killers, named for its player-manager, future Hall of Fame member King Kelly. Late in the season, Kelly moved the Eastern League's Binghamton Bingoes here as the Allentown Buffalos. Kelly, the era's most flamboyant figure, died of pneumonia that fall at age 35, and the Buffalos were dissolved. \nIn 1895, the Allentown Goobers returned to Pennsylvania State League play for one season. In 1898, yet another team was formed, re-using the name the Allentown Peanuts. The Peanuts played for three seasons in the Atlantic League, which succeeded the Pennsylvania State League in 1896. The league and the team were dissolved in 1900.\n20th century.\nOver the next two decades, the city saw limited play. In 1908, Allentown hosted a team in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey League, and a Tri-State League club played here from 1912 to 1914. Then, in the 1920s, the name the Allentown Dukes was revived for a semi-professional team that played four seasons (1923–26) at Edgemont Field, a new ballfield at Second and Susquehanna Streets. On September 7, 1923 the Dukes played an exhibition game with the New York Yankees at Edgemont Field. The Dukes tied the score at 7–7 in the eighth inning. In the ninth, Babe Ruth struck out with the bases loaded, and the Dukes scored in the bottom of the inning to win 8–7. The semi-pro team led to the start of an Eastern League team under the same name in 1929. League champions the next year, the team was renamed the Allentown Buffaloes in 1931. At the end of the 1932 season, the league collapsed, and the Buffaloes folded.\nIn 1935, the city landed its first Major League farm team, when the Brooklyn Dodgers moved their Reading Brooks franchise here just six games into the season. The Allentown Brooks, like the Dukes and Buffaloes, played their home games at the Allentown Fairgrounds. The club, which was in the New York–Pennsylvania League (forerunner of today's Eastern League), finished out the 1936 season, but did not return the next year.\nIn 1939, the Boston Braves established an Interstate League club, again using the name the Allentown Dukes, and a new park was built on the city's South Side, Fairview Field (now Earl F. Hunsicker Bicentennial Park). The team won the league championship that year. The next year, 1940, the league was upgraded from Class C to B, and the team became the Allentown Fleetwings, a St. Louis Cardinals franchise. The Philadelphia Phillies took over in 1941, playing a season as the Allentown Wings, but the franchise reverted to St. Louis the next year. Renamed the Allentown Cardinals in 1944, the team played at Fairview Field until 1948, when St. Louis Cardinals owner Sam Breadon built a new park. Breadon Field, a steel and concrete stadium that seated 5,000 fans, was located just north of the city in Whitehall Township.\nThe demise of the Interstate League at the end of the 1952 season resulted in a one-year lull for the franchise. In 1954, the Allentown Cardinals returned as a member of the Class A Eastern League. The team won the league championship in 1955, but had its final season the next year, 1956. Midway through the 1957 season, the Syracuse Chiefs, an unaffiliated Eastern League team, moved to Allentown on July 13 to finish out the season. The Allentown Chiefs were replaced a year later by a Boston Red Sox franchise. The Allentown Red Sox played three seasons at the Whitehall ball park, which was bought by Hess's department store owner Max Hess, Jr., and renamed Max Hess Stadium. When the Red Sox left at the end of the 1960 season, the stadium closed and was demolished in 1964. Today, the site is the home of the Lehigh Valley Mall, which opened in 1976. The ballfield was located near the mall's entrance from MacArthur Road.\nIn 1997, professional baseball returned to the city with the startup of the Allentown Ambassadors, an independent team that played in the Northeast and Northern leagues. The club, which had its last full season in 2003, was based at Bicentennial Park in South Allentown.\nThe city unveiled Coca-Cola Park, a $48.4 million, 8,500-seat stadium, in 2008. The stadium was constructed on Allentown's east side to serve as the home field for the Philadelphia Phillies' AAA-level Minor League baseball team, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. The IronPigs, a member of the International League, are the first Major League-affiliated club to play in the city since 1960.\n=21st century.\nDuring Summer 2008, the Lehigh Valley Heritage Museum introduced an exhibit, \"Play Ball! Baseball in America and the Lehigh Valley,\" celebrating the history of baseball in Allentown and the surrounding region."

The team has competed in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) since 2005, having previously played in the Big East. The Eagles have appeared in 7 NCAA Tournaments in their history, most recently in 2006. They play home games at the Conte Forum, and are currently coached by Joanna Bernabei-McNamee, entering her fourth year.\nHistory.\nThe Boston College women's basketball team played its first game January 9, 1973, and lost to Eastern Nazarene 42–35. In its next game BC downed Jackson, 52–30, to win its first game in the program's history. The Eagles finished their first season 4–6 with wins over Mount Ida, Stonehill College and Radcliffe. In her second season as head coach, Maureen Enos lead BC to a 9–4 record for the team's first-ever winning record.\nMargo Plotzke took over in time for the 1980 season and she would finish her 14-season career on The Heights with only five losing seasons and a 177 wins.\nIn 1982 the women's team joined the Big East, finishing the season with a then-BC record 17 wins, but going only 3–7 in the conference. In the Big East tourney Boston College beat UConn 69–57, but bowed out after a loss to Providence, 56–38. In 1984–85 BC went 19–9 – its best season to that date – but found itself on the short end of a loss to Vilanova in the league tournament, ending its season.\nCathy Inglese arrives.\nIn 1993 Cathy Inglese was named head coach of the basketball team and, after several years of rebuilding, turned the team into a perennial NCAA tournament team. Since the 1998–99 season, BC has been invited to the NCAA tournament six times, won the 2004 Big East title and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen twice—in 2003 and 2004.\nIn the 1998–99 season Inglese lead the Eagles to its first ever NCAA tournament appearance, a 22–8 overall record and the Eagles went 12–6 in the Big East. In its first-ever NCAA tourney game, BC beat Ohio State and then ran into Pat Summitt and Tennessee and lost in the second round.\nThe next season was even better for the Eagles as they won 26 total games, but again found themselves eliminated in the second round of the NCAA tournament when Virginia edged them out, 74–70. A season plagued by injuries marred the 2000-01 team which finished at 14-15 and on the outside looking into The Dance. In 2001–02, BC—who finished the season ranked 21st—received another invitation to the NCAA tournament but were ousted in the first round this time when Mississippi State took care of the women's team 65–59.\nSweet Sixteen years.\nCoach Inglese lead Boston College to back-to-back appearances in the Sweet Sixteen in the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons. BC finished the 2003 season ranked No. 25 and entered the NCAA tourney with a 20–9 record and, as a No. 5 seed, squeaked by Old Dominion 73–72 in the first round, then won another thriller on an Amber Jacobs jumper, which blounced around the rim, and fell in with 2.5 seconds remaining — giving the Eagles an 86–85 overtime win over Vanderbilt. Boston College was then steamrolled by No. 1 UConn as Diana Taurasi and Co. bounced BC 70–49.\nIn 2004 the women's team exacted some postseason revenge when BC upset the University of Connecticut in the Big East Tournament, 73–70, in the semi-finals. Boston College, who defeated Syracuse and Miami en route to its March 8 win over the Huskies, downed Rutgers in the finals to capture the Big East Tournament title—becoming the first Big East team to win four games to take the tournament crown. For its tournament title, BC finished the year ranked No. 18 and headed into the NCAA's as a No. 3 seed. The Eagles downed Eastern Michigan 58–56 in the first round; BC had an easier time in the second round, routing Ohio State 63–48 to move onto its second Sweet Sixteen in as many years. The No. 7-seeded University of Minnesota scored a mild upset over the Eagles with a 76–63 win and eliminated BC from the tournament.\n2004–05 season.\nIn its final year in the Big East the Boston College women's team finished the year at 20–10 with another trip to the NCAA's. In the regular season, BC finished a respectable 10–6 in conference play, but got bounced in its only game in the league tourney, losing 41–37 to Villanova. Then BC beat the University of Houston 65–43 in the first round of the NCAA tournament, but with a tough draw, were edged out by Duke 70–65.\n2005–06 season.\nBoston College entered the 2005–06 season as a participant of the Preseason NIT. Following a 51–44 win over Drexel and a 62–51 victory over Richmond, BC ran into and were stuffed by former Big East rival UConn 60–46 in the semifinal round. The women rebounded with 41-point win over Vermont, topping the Catamounts 79–38. Boston College entered league play with a 12–2 record and ranked no. 19 in the country, including a stunning win against then top-10 ranked Stanford University. In BC's first-ever ACC game, the women lost in overtime to Maryland 67–64. After a rough 0–4 start to ACC play, the Eagles bounced back to win seven straight games, including wins in six consecutive conference games. BC won its first-ever ACC game as a league member on January 26 when it downed Virginia 57–43. The Eagles then won at NC State on January 30, 75–66.\nThe winning streak came to an end when BC was confronted with two straight games against top-5 opponents. On February 16, No. 4 Maryland downed the Eagles 86–59; then the BC women fell again, losing to the No. 2 team in the country when North Carolina dropped Boston College on Tobacco Road, 69–62. The regular season ended on a sour note for Boston College as NC State and Florida State handed BC two more losses on February 24 and February 26 respectively, closing the regular season with four straight losses for the Eagles. The Boston College women stand at 19–11 overall (6–8 ACC) and are No. 25 in the coaches' poll as of March 7. BC senior forward Brooke Queenan was named All-ACC Second Team. Queenan led the Eagles with 14.8 points and 8.0 rebounds-per-game for BC in the regular season.\nBoston College lost its first-round game in its first-ever ACC tournament as the No. 8 seed, falling to Virginia 57–54 on March 2. BC earned an at-large bid in the NCAA field. The Eagles received a No. 8 seed beat Notre Dame 78-61 following 17 days off between games. BC advanced to the field of 32 to face No. 1 seeded Ohio State, a team which had won twenty straight games coming in. The underdog Eagles beat the Buckeyes 79–69 largely behind the performance of BC guard Kindyll Dorsey, who scored a school NCAA tournament record six 3-pointers and 24 points overall. BC then lost to the No. 5 seeded Utah Utes in the Sweet Sixteen 57–54, missing three potential game-tying shots in the last 20 seconds.\nAfter the season, forward Brooke Queenan was drafted by the New York Liberty of the WNBA in the second round, making her the third WNBA draft pick in BC history after Amber Jacobs and Cal Bouchard. Despite losing Queenan, All-ACC defensive teamer Aja Parham, and steady forward Lisa Macchia, BC headed into the offseason with a strong core of returning players including returning captain and point guard Sarah Marshall, senior guard Kindyll Dorsey, and senior center Kathrin Ress, as well as star incoming freshman, American Idol semifinalist, recording artist and McDonald's All-American Ayla Brown.\n2009–10 season.\nThe Boston College Lady Eagles were off to a slow start with losses to teams such as Harvard and Vermont.

        "text": "Hugh White (November 7, 1876 – June 11, 1936) was an American college football player and coach. He played for the University of Michigan from 1898 to 1901, and captained the national championship-winning 1901 team.\nEarly life and education.\nWhite was born in Lapeer, Michigan, in 1876, the son of Henry Kirke White and Jane Wigglesworth White. His father had run away from home as a boy, crewed on a whaling ship, participated in the California Gold Rush, and fought in the American Civil War. White received a Ph.B in 1899 and an LL.B. in 1902 from the University of Michigan.\nCollege football career.\nWhite played left tackle for the Michigan during the 1898 season, left end in the 1899 season, and returned to left tackle in the 1900 and 1901 seasons. As a senior, he captained the 1901 Michigan Wolverines football team, the first of Fielding H. Yost's famous \"Point-a-Minute\" teams, which went undefeated with an 11–0 record, outscored their opponents 550–0, and defeated Stanford in the inaugural Rose Bowl, 49–0. In the Rose Bowl, Michigan put the ball in play 142 times for 1,463 offensive yards. Stanford coach Charles Fickert, asked Michigan coach Yost to stop the game, since his team was no match for Michigan, but Yost insisted the game continue. Yost had been ousted as Stanford's coach the year before. With eight minutes left in the game, White agreed with Stanford captain, R. S. Fisher, to stop play.\nLater life.\nIn early 1902, White was considered for the football coaching job at Haskell Institute—now known as Haskell Indian Nations University—in Lawrence, Kansas and applied for the same post at Purdue University. In June 1902, he was hired as the football coach at Washington University in St. Louis. He married Abbie E. Cutting of Lapeer, Michigan, in 1903. They were the parents of three daughters, Elizabeth, Martha, and Marion. In 1904, White umpired Ivy League football games. He later worked as an engineer and became president (1924–1927) and Chairman of the Board (1927–1933) of the George A. Fuller Company, one of the largest construction companies in the United States, which erected major public buildings such as the Lincoln Memorial (1918), the United States Supreme Court Building (1933), and major office buildings. White served as Village President of Scarsdale, New York. He died of pneumonia on June 11, 1936, after a brief illness."

        "title": "Eric Owens (table tennis)",
        "text": "Eric Owens (born 1975 or 1976) is a professional American table tennis player. Owens began playing and competing in tournaments nationwide at the early age of six. Owens won every major National Junior, and Junior Olympic title. Owens won several major titles, including the US National Championships and North American Championships. He was on the US National Team competing in six (6) World Championships, three (3) Pan-American Games, winning a Gold and Bronze Medal. Owens was inducted to the US Table Tennis Hall of Fame in 2015.\nEarly life.\nEric Owens was born in Houston, Texas. His father, Kenny Owens, was an average-level tournament player, who was described as a table tennis \"fanatic\" and strict disciplinarian and loved table tennis. He hired professional table tennis coaches from all over the world including Nigeria, Jamaica, former Yugoslavia, and others, to train Eric very early on.\nIn 1985, at the age of 9, Eric Owen’s father took him to Sweden to watch the World Championships where he witnessed for the first time elite level professional table tennis. Eric immediately fell in love with the sport and decided that he wanted to be a professional table tennis player.\nDuring this time, Eric was also a competitive distance runner, competing in the National Championships in the 1500m. Owens was the only athlete in his 5 state region (around Texas) to qualify for the National Championships with a sub- 5:40 mile (running a 5:39 in the last race of the season). He later began competing in longer distances and ran in the Dallas White Rock Marathon. At that time, organizers of the marathon only allowed participants of 16+ years but Owens was allowed to compete since he completed the \"Torturous 20\" twice (a 20-mile race up and down hills in Dallas, TX); he finished the Dallas White Rock Marathon in 4 hours and 6 minutes.\nAt the age of 10, Owens decided the toll of being a nationally competitive table tennis player and runner was too much so he hung up his shoes and decided to pursue professional table tennis as a sole focus.\nProfessional Table Tennis Career.\nOver the years, Eric won every major National Junior, and Junior Olympic title, including U-10, U-12, U-14, U-16, U-18, and U-22 age groups.\nAround the age of 16, Owens moved overseas to live and train full-time competing in professional leagues and tournaments in Sweden, Norway, Germany, France, China, Japan, and South Korea; he worked with renowned coaches and players, and competed at an elite international level.\nIn 1996, Owens qualified as an alternate to the Olympic Team. The next year, he qualified for his first US National Team and then went on to represent the US for the next decade at six (6) world championships and three (3) Pan-American Games and was one of the most successful table tennis players in American history. Owens is the only American born male player in history to win a Gold Medal in the Pan-American Games, win the US National Title in Men's Singles and Doubles, and represent the US National Team at six World Championships.\nHighlights of Owens' career and accolades include: \nAt the age of 26, Eric decided to return to the US to pursue a college degree while continuing to compete in collegiate table tennis.\nIn 2015, Owens was inducted to the US Table Tennis Hall of Fame recognizing his lifetime accomplishments as a professional table tennis player.\nEducation.\nEric Owens competed in college-level table tennis at Texas Wesleyan University (2002-2006), while majoring in biochemistry/pre-med. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry and a minor in physics. Owens had a very successful college career with the following major titles:\nWhile studying at Texas Wesleyan, Owens also won the following university academic awards:\nOwens finished top of his class and graduated magna cum laude in 2006.\nIn late 2006, Owens moved to Chicago after he signed a contract with Killerspin table tennis as a Professional Athlete. Eric represented the company in national and international table tennis competitions along with participating in international advertising campaigns and publicity efforts. His move to Chicago also allowed him to pursue graduate education with a master's degree in biomedical science from Midwestern University. His Master’s work focused on pain and inflammatory conditions, such as, rheumatoid arthritis.\nAt that point in his education, Owens wanted to go into research but decided to enter medical school.\nDuring medical school, Owens started a company, Delos Therapy. While in his third year of medical school, one of his classmate's father was seeking treatment for pain. Eric's classmate heard of his innovative approach to treating pain and plans of starting a company and asked if he could help her father. Eric obliged and began treatment out of his apartment. The therapy was successful and quickly grew to other family members and friends ultimately Owens giving 20–30 hours of therapy per week, while carrying a full medical school load. With a growing clientele and in his fourth year, he contacted Mimi Bosika, who has an MBA from Booth in entrepreneurship, to start a formal process of development of Delos Therapy. Together, as they sought investors, a patient provided an initial investment for start-up costs and training therapists. Soon, Delos Therapy was up and running as a full clinic.\nAt this time, Bosika was a sales manager at David Barton Gym (DBG) and personal friends with David Barton. Delos Therapy was offered a temporary opportunity to utilize vacant massage rooms at the gym, where Delos therapists treated many of the gym’s clients with overuse injuries. As these clients recovered, they were able to resume their gym activities and purchase additional DBG personal training packages. The gym’s revenue dramatically increased and David Barton personally offered Delos Therapy to permanently occupy this River North clinic location. This is where Delos Therapy officially started their operations.\nAs Delos Therapy gained traction in their new clinic space, Eric trained and managed four therapists, treated patients, created and innovated the Delos Therapy training manual, and managed a full medical school rotation schedule. At the end of his fourth year of medical school, Owens took a leave of absence for six weeks to focus on growing Delos Therapy’s business. Despite his perseverance to complete residency applications, Owens ultimately forwent residency and pursued Delos full-time and did not return to medical school.\nLife After Table Tennis.\nDelos Therapy\nEric Owens continues to provide therapy through his business at Delos Therapy (now with 4 clinics and 10 therapists in the Chicago area), which was established in 2012 in Chicago, IL. Delos Therapy specializes in pain, stiffness, and athletic performance.\nOwens states that chronic pain remains to be one of the most common among medical complaints. Delos Therapy focuses on the principle that with repetitive motion and wear and tear of muscle tissue, the muscles become tight and fibrotic, causing common symptoms of pain, stiffness, and weakness. This fibrosis is not visible on conventional imaging, such as, MRIs or X-rays; and the fibrosis is getting missed diagnostically by mainstream medicine. Conventional treatments for such tightness and pain include stretching, strengthening, and/or medication management with opioids. Although beneficial in some cases, Owens believes this is not a complete therapy and is largely focused on symptoms rather than the root cause.\nThrough observational evidence and clinical work, Delos Therapy evangelizes that tight tissue cannot stretch or strengthen effectively if these fibers are fibrotic and immobile. The only parts of the muscle that are stretching and/or strengthening are the parts that are pliable and mobile, which is typically located around the tightness. The therapy focuses on the principle of direct pressure into the tight, fibrotic tissue forcing the individual muscle fibers to stretch apart at the location of the pressure. This is differentiated from a traditional deep tissue massage or foam rolling because these merely glide over the surface of the muscle, rather than force a stretch of the muscle fibers specific to the structure of tightness.\nDelos’ therapy breaks up the fibrosis, restructuring the muscle to its original anatomical state, thus restoring normal function, elasticity, range of motion, and dramatic improvements in physical and athletic performance.\nOwens considers this his life’s work and intends to conduct research to prove his theories and hopes to make a significant contribution to the field of pain and athletic performance and lay a foundation for further thought and study.\nSPiN\nIn 2016, Owens was approached by SPiN, a ping pong social club, to be a resident \"PRO\", where he currently organizes tournaments for private and corporate events, wows a crowd with table tennis exhibitions, engages SPiN's customers in table tennis, and provides private table tennis lessons."

        "title": "Skateboarding sponsorship",
        "text": "Skateboarding sponsorship is the commercial sponsorship of an individual or team of people who participate in skateboarding, competitions or public activities. Typically, the individual or team will receive cash payments, reduced-price or free merchandise or equipment from a sponsor in return for public and in-competition use of that sponsor's merchandise or equipment for promotional purposes and recipient testimonial or endorsement. Skateboarding sponsorship may also extend to the sponsorship of major competitions or venues (like specific skateparks) by larger distributors or manufacturers of skateboarding equipment and merchandise.\nSponsors employ a variety of methods in an effort to \"discover\" potential sponsorship recipients including word of mouth, the solicitation of \"sponsor-me\" videos and direct participation in public skateboarding events and competitions, as well as raising awareness through social media websites.\nIn the United States it is recommended that an organisation wishing to engage with Skateboarders via sponsorship apply to join the IASC. This allows a company to join, take part in and become credible within an already well established industry.\nSponsorship types.\nThere are two generally recognised classes of individual skateboarding sponsorship. Amateur and Professional. Both can come in different variations and can be agreed contractually in both verbal or written form.\nSkate shop sponsorship.\nSkate shop sponsorship is sponsorship by a local professional skateboarding industry retail company. Obligations under the terms of a shop sponsorship vary but are usually light and the rider usually represents the sponsor by wearing branded apparel and by submitting media (videos and photographs) for use in advertising campaigns. Shops commonly employ skateboarders and sponsor their employees. This occurs along with traditional discounts to subsidise pay or as part of an employment agreement. Some simple sponsorship agreements may involve the provision of discounted merchandise or equipment in exchange for a commitment to use that merchandise or equipment at public skate parks or local competitions.\nSkate shops may sponsor both amateur and professional skateboarders.\nAmateur sponsorship.\nAmateur skateboard sponsorship involves the light provision of merchandise and equipment along with the occasional payment of travel and accommodation or living expenses when representing a sponsor in an out of town competition. Amateur skateboarders are not paid to skate and many are too young in any event, as per law.\nA sponsored amateur skateboarder may receive some personal promotion as a brand \"team member\" and will commonly exchange marketing rights to their image for skateboarding equipment and other merchandising and or skateboard products.\nCompany flow sponsorship.\nFlow sponsorship is similar to shop sponsorship in that it generally involves the sponsorship of an individual by a small to medium commercial skateboard company or enterprise. However, flow sponsorship usually involves the provision of free merchandise (no cost to the sponsored individual) but the offer is not traditionally consistent or long term. Flow sponsorship is seen as one of the first stepping stones of opportunity which an aspiring professional skateboarder might accept on their journey to become pro. And is often used as an incentive before a skateboarder joins a team whilst they are considering all available offers from interested parties. The trade of goods mostly revolves around featuring in print, online and video based media. Personal appearances are rarely part of any agreement and the aim of a flow sponsorship is to give the skateboarder a hand into the industry to help them on to a path involving a career. By 2003, then-6-year-old Mitchie Brusco was committed to 9 such agreements.\nProfessional company individual sponsorship.\nProfessional sponsorship is sponsorship attached to royalty payments and comes with a regular salary in all but the worst of contract formats. Contracts vary but coverage of living expenses which allow the skateboarder to travel and practice to be able to compete on a full-time basis without the need to work full-time, may be factored in. Healthcare, image rights, bonuses, product design and art work licensing are commonly covered in professional skateboarding contracts. Sponsored skateboarders receive monthly packages of sponsored merchandise (including additional merchandise for promotional uses) and equipment (including customized \"pro model\" equipment) as well as branded clothing and other promotional items which feature the sponsored skater's name or personal logo.\nProfessional skateboarders may receive royalty payments collected against products sold by their sponsor(s) which display the skateboarder's name or logo.\nTraditionally endorsed products are professional grade decks, trucks, clothing, shoes and wheels. It is normal for a rider to primarily attach to a single deck manufacturer as a pro and professional model skateboard products tend to display the professional skateboarder's name prominently in painted or transferred graphics. Deck sponsorship is seen as a primary long term goal and a right of passage by aspiring amateur skateboarders. Obtaining one signifies current prominence within the skateboard industry.\nProfessional skateboarder Tony Hawk signed endorsement and sponsorship deals with a number of major brands worth up to 15 million each, including deals with a number of non-skateboarding brands most notably the \"Tony Hawk's\" series of video games published by Activision."

The All Blacks won 15-0 with their points coming from five tries, of which four were scored by winger Duncan McGregor. Their next meeting was on the All Blacks \"Invincibles\" tour of 1924-25. The match was most notable for the sending off of All Black lock Cyril Brownlie, who became the first player to ever be sent off in a test match. In 1936 England defeated the All Blacks for the first time when England winger Prince Alexander Obolensky scored two tries during a 13–0 victory at Twickenham Stadium. The All Blacks have never lost more than two consecutive matches to England (once, on losses in November 2002 and then June 2003), and have dominated the rivalry between the teams. Of the 43 matches between them, New Zealand have won 33 and England 8, with two draws.\nIn 2008, the Hillary Shield was introduced as the trophy to be contested in matches between the two teams.\nHillary Shield.\nThe Hillary Shield has been awarded to the winner of England – New Zealand Test matches since 2008. The shield is only contested in non-World Cup matches, and is named in honour of Sir Edmund Hillary — the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest. It was also conceived to recognise the links between New Zealand and England. When the shield was unveiled in 2008 by New Zealand's Prime Minister at the time, Helen Clark, and Hillary's widow, Lady June Hillary, Clark said of Hillary \"He was part of a British expedition when he conquered Mt Everest shortly after the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II\"."

        "text": "The Royal Musselburgh Golf Club is a golf club at Prestongrange House, Prestongrange near Prestonpans, East Lothian, Scotland, on the B1361.\nBetween 1774 and 1926, the club was based at Levenhall Links, Musselburgh.\nHistory.\nThe first golf clubs were founded in the 18th century. The first was the Royal Blackheath Golf Club, instituted in 1706, followed by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers in 1744, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1754, and the Royal Musselburgh Golf Club in 1774. These clubs gradually accepted some responsibility for the links on which they played.\nWhat is now the Royal Musselburgh Golf Club was established in 1774 as the Musselburgh Golf Club, and the Old Club Cup was played for the first time. It is the oldest golf trophy that has been played for continuously in the world, and it can be seen in the Clubhouse.\nIn 1811 the first Lady Golfer competition took place, and in 1834 the club issued a new set of rules.\nThe RMGC is the fifth oldest golf club in the world. It was originally played over the nine-hole course at Levenhall Links, and in 1872 the first clubhouse was built at the Links.\nIn 1876 the club became the Royal Musselburgh Golf Club. The royal title was granted by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, godson of the Duke of Wellington. He remained as Patron of the club until his death in 1942.\nIn 1908 RMGC merged with the New Club, one of four golf clubs on the Links.\nIn 1922 the Club entered a new era through the move to Prestongrange House and Estate, made possible through CISWO, the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation. The new clubhouse was a 12th-century historic house, originally owned by the monks of Newbattle Abbey. An 18-hole course was designed by renowned golf course architect James Braid as a traditional parkland course, yet close to the sea. The yardage is 6237.\nThe club in the 21st century.\nRoyal Musselburgh Golf Club is part of Lothian and Borders Police's \"Golf Initiative\" which enables school pupils to have free coaching and support.\nIn the Telegraph newspaper's search for the most characterful golf course in Scotland, RMGC won the accolade of \"Most venerable\" golf course."

        "title": "Cricket in Ireland",
        "text": "Cricket in Ireland is governed by Cricket Ireland, which maintains the Ireland men's and women's cricket teams. Like several other sports in Ireland, cricket is organised on an all-Ireland basis. Following the team's success in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the sport's popularity increased in Ireland. The country was, until 2017, an associate member of the International Cricket Council and played in tournaments like the World Cricket League and ICC Intercontinental Cup, which are qualifying rounds for associate teams for the Cricket World Cup and ICC World Twenty20. Ireland qualified for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2010 ICC World Twenty20. In the 2011 World Cup, they beat England in the group matches.\nIn 2017, domestic cricket in Ireland was recognised as first-class cricket for the first time. In recognition of their progress as a cricketing nation, Ireland was granted Full Member (and hence Test) status for the men's national side, in 2017. Ireland played their first men's Test Match against Pakistan in May 2018, losing by 5 wickets. Ireland's women played a test match prior to full membership in 2000, coincidentally also against Pakistan.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nCricket has been played in Ireland since at least the 17th century, when Oliver Cromwell issued an edict banning it. It is believed to have been introduced to Ireland by the British, although recent research claims that Irish troops in the British Army shaped the game's evolution, by introducing terms and gameplay from the old Irish game of Catty. The earliest known reference to a match in Ireland is the August 1792 fixture in Dublin between the British garrison and an \"All-Ireland\" team, the garrison team winning by an innings.\nCricket was being played in the towns of Kilkenny and Ballinasloe in the early 19th century, with the Ballinasloe club established in 1825. In the 1830s, the game began to drop down; many of the clubs which were founded in the following 30 years are still in existence today. The first Irish national team played in 1855 against an English national team in Dublin. In the 1850s, the Englishman Charles Lawrence was responsible for developing the game in Ireland through his coaching. In the 1850s and 1860s, Ireland was visited for the first time by touring professional teams. Ireland's first match against Marylebone Cricket Club was in 1858. The game increased in popularity until the early 1880s.\nTwo changes in the late 1800s-early 1900s damaged the popularity of cricket and cricketers in Ireland. The first was the outbreak of the Land War in the late 1800s resulting from the mistreatment of tenants by absentee landlords when landlord and tenant were alienated. The second was a ban placed in 1901 on the playing of \"foreign\" games by the Gaelic Athletic Association, which was not lifted until 1970. Anyone playing foreign games such as cricket would be banned from the extremely popular Irish games of hurling and Gaelic football as it was popularly referred to as a 'garrison game' enjoyed primarily by the occupying British forces and the landowning Protestant oligarchy they protected.\nIrish teams toured Canada and the United States in 1879, 1888, 1892, and 1909. On top of this, Ireland defeated a touring South African side in 1904. Their first match with first-class status was played on 19 May 1902 against a London County side including W.G. Grace. The Irish, captained by Sir Tim O'Brien, lost convincingly by 238 runs.\nModern Era.\nThe 2005 ICC Trophy was hosted by Ireland. After Ireland's successes at the 2007 Cricket World Cup, cricket experienced a popularity boom in Ireland, with participation reaching record levels.\nParticipation.\nAccording to the Cricket Ireland strategic plan for 2021–2023, 52,000 people in Ireland play, officiate or administer cricket or are involved in school programmes. This is compared to 13,000 people in 2007.\nThere are more than 120 active cricket clubs on the island. Women and girls make up 19% of participation numbers. Immigration to Ireland has boosted participation with 70% of people involved through Leinster being of non-Irish origin.\n27,000 children participated in school programs in 2019.\nGoverning body.\nThe Irish Cricket Union (ICU) – the governing body of Irish cricket – was officially founded in 1923, although its predecessor had been active since 1890.\nIn 2007, it announced that it would undergo major structural changes in order to bring it in-line with the main cricket governing bodies.\nIn 2008, the Irish Cricket Union was formally dissolved and replaced with Irish Cricket Union Limited, which would go by the trading name of Cricket Ireland. A new governance structure was implemented, with the Board of Directors comprising a Chair, six nominees from four Provincial Unions and five independent directors. All Board members are non-executive and act in a voluntary capacity.\nWarren Deutrom has served as CEO since 2006.\nNational Teams.\nMen's National Team.\nThe Ireland cricket team is the cricket team representing all Ireland (i.e., both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland). They compete in Test, ODI and T20I competitions in international cricket. Ireland was granted ODI status after finishing second in the 2005 ICC Trophy, while also qualifying for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the first time they had done so. They were awarded Test status in 2017.\nDifficulty with retention of players.\nIn the period before and after obtaining ODI status, Ireland lost a number of their most talented players to England. This was due to Ireland's lack of professional wages and an inability to play Test cricket. Since gaining Full Member status, a senior player has not left the play elsewhere internationally.\nDublin-born batsman Ed Joyce had played with some success as part of Ireland's ICC Trophy team and became a key member of the Sussex side in England's County Championship; he also previously captained Middlesex in the 2004 season. Joyce decided to declare to for England in 2005 in order to try to play Test cricket, he was called up in 2006 and made his ODI debut against Ireland. Joyce never played a Test for England and returned to play for Ireland in 2011. He retired in 2018 and is now Head Coach of the Ireland Women's team.\nTalented batsman Eoin Morgan who earlier represented Ireland in tournaments including the ICC World Cup and the ICC World Twenty20 qualified and played for England, making no secret of his desire to play Test cricket. He played 16 Tests for England and captained the ODI team to victory in the 2019 Cricket World Cup.\nFormer Ireland seamer Boyd Rankin also joined England in 2013 before returning to play for Ireland until retiring in 2021.\nAfter the World Cup, Irish cricket experienced a dip in success with poor results in the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy as many players were unavailable. The Irish cricket team was an amateur side at the time and most of the players had full-time jobs with commitments conflicting with cricket. After the World Cup there were delays in paying the players which resulted in them ignoring the press in protest to their treatment after an Intercontinental Cup match against Kenya.\nWarren Deutrom, the chief executive of the ICU, had stated that it wanted to \"seek actively to place Irish players into top-level cricket, by developing relationships with [especially] county cricket which will incorporate appropriate player release for Irish international duty, and feeder systems for developing Irish cricketers\". The reorganised ICU's sought to make closer links with the English counties, encourage the development of age group cricket, and to introduce a professional element into the Irish game. They also want to take the Irish cricket team on winter tours more often. In an attempt to prevent the game losing players to counties or other commitments such as jobs, it was suggested that central contracts should be introduced.\nEnglish county competition.\nIreland, along with Scotland, has at times played in competitions for English county cricket sides, including the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and the Friends Provident Trophy (previously the C&amp;G Trophy). Since there is no nationality restriction in county cricket, non-Irish players have competed for Ireland in these matches. For example, Hansie Cronje of South Africa competed for Ireland in the 1997 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, and more recently New Zealander Jesse Ryder played for Ireland in 2007. In 2004 Ireland beat Surrey by five wickets in the C&amp;G Trophy.\nFor the 2006 season, the C&amp;G Trophy was reorganised to include a round-robin stage instead of being entirely knock-out. Whereas Ireland had only one match guaranteed in the tournament before, they now had more fixtures against English county sides. For the 2006 tournament, they were bolstered by the signings of Saqlain Mushtaq and Shahid Afridi, the two overseas players they were allowed when competing in English domestic competitions. Ireland recorded one win in their nine matches. Their victory was over Gloucestershire on 30 April by 47 runs.\nThe C&amp;G Trophy changed its name to Friends Provident Trophy for the 2007 season. In 2007, Ireland played in the Friends Provident Trophy against nine English county sides. Of those nine matches, they lost six and the remaining three matches were abandoned due to rain. They finished bottom in the South Conference of the trophy. For the 2008 season, the round-robin section of the trophy was changed from two divisions to three; Ireland was in the newly formed Midlands Division. In 2008, Ireland played eight games in the Midlands Division, winning one match with one no result and six losses. They finished fifth in the division which had five teams. Ireland's four wicket victory over Warwickshire on 16 May was Ireland's first win in the competition against a county side for two years. Captain William Porterfield anchored the innings with 69 runs.\nDomestic cricket.\nInter-Provincial Series.\nThe Inter-Provincial Series ('Interpros') was introduced for the first time in 2013 as part of Cricket Ireland's strategy to attain Test status by 2020. It featured three teams representing their respective provincial unions: Leinster Lightning, North West Warriors, Northern Knights. Munster Reds were added to the T20 competition in 2017 and then the List A competition in 2021. Connacht Cricket Union do not take any part in these competitions.\nFirst-Class.\nThe multi-day competition is called the Inter-Provincial Championship. In October 2016, the International Cricket Council agreed to award the competition first-class status as part of efforts to elevate Ireland to becoming a Full Member. The competition was not held in 2020 due to the Coronavirus pandemic and has yet to return. Leinster Lightning have been the most successful team in the competition, winning six of the seven seasons.\nList A.\nThe one-day competition is called the Inter-Provincial Cup. At the same time that the ICC awarded first-class status to the Inter-Provincial Championship, List A status was also conferred on the Inter-Provincial Cup. Leinster Lightning have been the most successful team in the competition, winning eight of the ten seasons.\nTwenty20.\nThe 20 over competition is called the Inter-Provincial Trophy. The competition also received official Twenty20 status in October 2016. Leinster Lightning have been the most successful team in the competition, winning seven of the ten seasons.\nContracts and Eligibility.\nIn a Cricket Ireland press release, High Performance Director Richard Holdsworth explained the process for the provinces to award contracts for the Interpros. He said that each team would be allowed to award sixteen contracts. These contracts would not involve regular salaries for reasons of budget, but they would include match fees and help with expenses such as travel and gym memberships.\nTo be eligible for a contract, a player must either be an Irish national or play for an Irish club in one of the five cricketing provinces. Holdsworth said that the Interpros should provide a direct pathway into the Ireland side, but that retired internationals like Nigel Jones and Albert van der Merwe would still be eligible. Teams are allowed to play up to two non-Irish nationals in the Championship matches.\nEach province would first have the opportunity to sign players from their own province, such as a Leinster-based player playing for Leinster, but players would also be able to play for non-local provinces if they preferred. He also said that provinces would be allowed to bring in players from outside their squads who are excelling in club cricket.\nClub cricket.\nClub cricket is organised on a provincial basis, with each of four major provinces – Leinster, Munster, Northern and North West – organising its own senior leagues and cups.\nClubs within the Connacht Cricket Union, the smallest and newest provincial union, generally compete in Munster Union competition.\nIrish Senior Cup.\nSince 1982, Cricket Ireland has organised the 50-over Irish Senior Cup on an all-Ireland basis. The competition has held a similar format since its inception – featuring 32 teams: ten clubs from each of Leinster, the North and North West, and two from Munster, producing a five-round knockout. At times entries have exceeded 32 teams, requiring the need for preliminary games.\nWaringstown are the most successful team in the competition's history win six titles. CIYMS are the current holders, they beat Lisburn in the 2022 final.\nAll-Ireland T20 Cup.\nThe All-Ireland T20 Cup is the national club T20 competition in Ireland - bringing together the best T20 teams in club cricket across the provinces.\nThe men's competition began in 2017 and features the winner of each of the four Provincial Unions’ T20 club competition playing off in four team knockout format. The semi-finals and the final are played on the same day. CIYMS are the current holders of the Cup having beaten Cork Harlequins in the 2022 final.\nThe women's tournament began in 2021 and features a preliminary final between the winner of the NCU's and NWCU's T20 club competition to play in the final against the winner of Leinster's T20 club competition. Merrion beat CIYMS in the 2022 final and are the current holders of the Cup.\nTrans-national.\nIn 2019, Cricket Ireland, Cricket Scotland and the Royal Dutch Cricket Association announced the creation of a Twenty20 league competition, the Euro T20 Slam, involving two new city-based franchises per nation. In April of that year, it was confirmed that the as yet unnamed Irish franchises would be based in Dublin and Belfast.\nThe first season of the Twenty20 franchise-based league was scheduled to start in August 2019 but was postponed due to unforeseen reasons. Cricket Ireland again announced postponement of the competition in 2021.\nInternational cricket grounds.\nThere are four international cricket venues in Ireland that have been approved by the International Cricket Council to host international cricket.\nCricket Ireland is also committed to the creation of a fifth international ground in Abbotstown, West Dublin. In January 2023, Cricket Ireland was given the go ahead by Minister for Sport Catherine Martin to proceed with development in Abbotstown on the Sport Ireland campus. CEO Warren Deutrom said he expected work on pitches to begin in 2023 in order to be ready to co-host the 2030 T20 World Cup alongside England and Scotland.\nThere is currently no international ground in either of the Munster or Connacht Cricket Union areas."

        "title": "2009 LSU Tigers baseball team",
        "text": "The 2009 LSU Tigers baseball team represented Louisiana State University in the NCAA Division I baseball season of 2009. This was the first year for the team in the new Alex Box Stadium.\nThe 2009 team was coached by Paul Mainieri who was in his third season at LSU. During his first year at LSU, Mainieri's team posted a 29–26–1 record, but failed to make the SEC tournament or the NCAA tournament. The team improved during his second year posting a 49–19–1 record, while claiming the SEC Western Division Title, SEC Tournament championship, and earned the No. 7 National Seed for the 2008 NCAA tournament. They advanced to the 2009 College World Series.\nPrevious season.\nPaul Mainieri completed his second season as head coach at LSU in 2008. The Tigers won the SEC West division title which earned them the No. 2 seed in the 2008 SEC baseball tournament. The Tigers would go on to the win the tournament and secure a spot in the NCAA post-season.\nAfter winning the SEC Tournament, it was announced that LSU was selected as a host site for the 2008 NCAA tournament for the 18th time in the history of the program and for the first time since the 2005 season. When the full NCAA tournament bracket was released, LSU was awarded the No. 7 national seed in the tournament, guaranteeing them home field advantage throughout the Super Regionals as long as they won the Regional round. LSU was able to sweep the Baton Rouge regional to secure a spot in the Super Regional round.\nUC-Irvine won the Lincoln, NE regional and moved on to the Super Regional to face LSU. After losing the first game, LSU's hopes of a national title were slim going into the 9th inning of game 2. However the Tigers fought back and won the game in comeback fashion by a score of 9–7. LSU wasted no time in game 3 cruising to a 6–0 lead in the 1st inning and eventually winning the game 21–7. The Tigers celebrated the school's 14th trip to the College World Series in what was the last game in the 70-year history of Alex Box Stadium.\nLSU faced North Carolina in the first game of the 2008 College World Series. The Tar Heels defeated the Tigers by a score of 8–4, giving LSU its 5th consecutive CWS loss and sending them to the losers bracket. The Tigers faced the Rice Owls next and looked to be headed home with an 0–2 CWS record again after trailing by a score of 5–0, however, in typical Tiger fashion, LSU rallied in the bottom of the 9th inning and won the game on a 3-run double by All-American Blake Dean.\nThe Tigers then had to face North Carolina again, who had lost to Fresno State. The game started on June 19, 2008, but was delayed by weather and completed on June 20, 2008. The game went into the top of the 9th inning tied 3–3 but a grand slam home run, the first in the College World Series since 2001, gave North Carolina a 7–3 lead. LSU was unable to rally in the bottom of the 9th, and their season was ended.\nThe 2008 squad compiled and overall record of 49–19–1, which included a 23-game win streak.\nPre-Season.\nCoaching changes.\nOn June 12, 2008 Terry Rooney was named Head Baseball Coach at the University of Central Florida.\nOn June 23, 2008, it was announced that Cliff Godwin would join Rooney at Central Florida as an assistant coach.\nOn June 26, 2008, Paul Mainieri announced the hiring of David Grewe as associate head coach. Grewe previously coached under Mainieri at Notre Dame before leaving in 2005 to become the Head Coach at Michigan State.\nIt was also announced that Javi Sanchez and Will Davis were promoted. Sanchez was promoted from volunteer assistant to a full-time assistant. He replaced Godwin as the Tigers hitting coach and supervisor of base running. Davis was promoted from Director of Baseball Operations to volunteer assistant.\nThe final change to Mainieri's staff that was announced on June 26 was the appointment of Kyle Beerbohm. Beerbohm was appointed as an undergraduate student assistant coach, and is a former Tiger pitcher.\nOn August 20, 2008, it was announced that Ross Brezovsky was hired as the Coordinator of Baseball Operation.\nRanked #1.\nOn December 22, 2008, the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper released their NCAA Div. 1 Pre-Season Poll with LSU ranked #1. LSU reached a No. 2 ranking in 2008, but had not been ranked No. 1 in quite some time.\nOn January 22, 2009, LSU was also ranked No. 1 in the USA Today/ESPN baseball pre-season poll. They narrowly beat out North Carolina for the top spot.\nRoster.\n2009 Players.\ncodice_1Ryan Byrd\nGame Summaries/Recaps.\nRegular season.\nFebruary.\nVillanova.\nLSU began the season with a three-game home series against Villanova. The start of baseball season, also marked the opening of a brand new stadium for LSU. The new Alex Box Stadium was completed after the 2008 season, and the Tigers moved into the stadium shortly before the 2009 season kicked off. LSU opened the season on February 20 with a 12–3 victory behind the right arm of Louis Coleman. LSU won game 2 11–1 and completed the sweep winning Sunday's contest 6–3.\nSouthern.\nThere was little time to rest after the weekend sweep, as the Southern Jaguars made their first trip to the new \"box\" on Wednesday February 25. Freshman Chris Matulis got the start for the Tigers. He pitched five strong innings before turning the ball over to the bullpen with a 4–1 lead. LSU was able to hold on to the lead to claim the victory 11–5 to improve to 4–0 on the young season.\nCentral Florida.\nTwo former Tiger assistants returned to the \"box\" for the weekend series against Central Florida, but this time they were in the opposite dugout. Terry Rooney left LSU after the 2008 season to become head coach at UCF and brought former Tiger assistant Cliff Godwin with him. Both coaches were an integral part in LSU's magical run to Omaha during the 2008 season, but UCF had a large hill to climb. The Knights were no match for LSU as the Tigers outscored them 13–4, 11–2, and 16–0 to claim another series sweep.\nMay.\nLSU entered the last month of the regular season with an overall record of 34–11. They were in first place in the SEC Western Division and were tied with Georgia for the overall SEC lead with a record of 14–7.\n#12 Arkansas.\nWith Arkansas only a half game back of LSU for the SEC West lead, the weekend series was pivotal for both teams. Unfortunately, both teams had to wait until Saturday to play the first game due to inclement weather. In game 1 of the Saturday double header, Arkansas fell behind early, but was able to overcome the deficit thanks to a dominating pitching effort by Dallas Keuchel that helped Arkansas take game 1, 11–4. Keuchel pitched 8.1 innings and improved to 7–1 overall on the season.\nGoing into game 2 of the doubleheader, LSU now trailed Arkansas by a half game for the SEC West lead. Much like game 1, the second game was also dominated by pitching, but this time it was LSU pitching that dominated. Senior RHP Louis Coleman was about nab a complete game, 2-hit shutout as LSU won the game 5–0. This placed LSU back at the top of the SEC West standings with a 15–8 record in conference play and 35–13 overall.\nThe rubber game of the series stayed true to form. LSU was again able to jump out to an early lead, going up 4–0 heading into the bottom of the fourth inning. That would be the last runs LSU plated in the game. Arkansas fought back to bring the score to 4–3 after the 5th, but LSU starter Austin Ross was able to keep the score there through the 6th. Coach Mainieri went to the bullpen after Ross gave up a leadoff single to begin the 7th. Sophomore Chad Jones came in and shut down the Razorbacks. Coach Mainieri went to the bullpen once again at the beginning of the 8th inning, bringing in freshman closer Matty Ott. Ott struck out the side in the 8th and closed out the game with a 1–2–3 9th to preserve the victory and give LSU the series 2–1.\n#11 Florida.\nFlorida traveled to Baton Rouge for another pivotal SEC series. Going into the weekend, both teams were sitting atop their respective divisions and tied for the overall SEC lead with a record of 16–8. In game 1, LSU used a strong outing from Anthony Ranaudo, as well as productive nights at the plate from D.J. LeMahieu and Blake Dean to take game 1 10–1. LSU grabbed the lead in the bottom of the third by scoring two runs and added 4 more in the bottom of the fourth to give Ranaudo a 6–0 lead. Florida scored their lone run in the top of the fifth. The win pushed LSU's mark to 17–8 and gave the Tigers the outright lead in the SEC.\nIn game 2, LSU received another great pitching performance from senior leader Louis Coleman. Coleman was able to give the Tigers 8 strong innings, allowing only 4 hits, 1 walk, and most importantly 0 runs. LSU plated two runs in the bottom of the first inning to give Coleman the early lead and they never looked back. LSU would score a third run in the bottom of the fourth, and their final run in the bottom of the eighth to win the game 4–0 and clinch another SEC series victory. LSU improved to 18–8 in the SEC, while Florida fell to 16–10.\nThe final game of the series was much different from the first two. Florida was able to secure its first lead in the series when they scored 3 runs in the top of the third. LSU was able to cut the deficit to 2 runs twice by scoring a run in the bottom of the fourth and fifth, but Florida was able to add more runs scoring 1 in the top of the fifth, 3 in the top of the seventh, and 2 in the top of the eighth. Florida took game 3 by a score of 9–3. The weekend left LSU with an overall record of 38–14 and 18–9 in the SEC. Even with the game 3 loss, LSU was able to remain atop the SEC standings with a half game lead over Alabama entering the last weekend of both SEC and regular season play.\nCentenary.\nLSU hosted Centenary in the final home game of the regular season, which also marked the completion of their first regular season in the new Alex Box Stadium. The Gents entered the game 28–14 on the season, while LSU entered the game 38–14 overall. LSU got up early scoring 2 runs in the bottom of the 1st inning, and extended their lead to 5–0 after a 3-run home run by freshman CF Mikie Mahtook. Centenary cut the lead to 5–3 in the top of the 5th and made it 5–4 in the top of the 8th, but LSU roared back in the bottom of the 8th to score 7 runs. LSU won the game 12–4 improving to 39–14 on the season. LSU finished the regular season with a 28–9 home record.\nMississippi St..\nLSU traveled to Starkville, MS for the final weekend of the regular season. The games for the series followed SEC procedures, and were played Thursday through Saturday, instead of the typical Friday – Sunday weekend series. The SEC established this procedure to give teams more rest between the end of the regular season and the start of the SEC Tournament.\nIn game 1, LSU jumped out to a quick lead behind a first inning Mikie Mahtook solo home run, but LSU would not hold the lead for long. Mississippi St. tied the game in the bottom of the second inning at 1, before taking the lead 4–1, in the bottom of the third inning. The Bulldogs would hold on to that lead entering the seventh inning, but the LSU offense erupted for 3 runs to tie the game at 4. In the top of the eighth inning, LSU used a wild pitch to score what would be the winning the run. LSU received a gutsy performance by starting pitcher Anthony Ranaudo who pitched 7.1 innings before turning the ball over to freshman closer Matty Ott. Ott finished the game to secure his twelfth save of the season as the Tigers improved to 40–15 overall and 19–8 in SEC play.\nA win in game 2 would ensure that LSU would at worst share the SEC regular season title. Much like game 1 though, LSU played catch-up most of the game. The Bulldogs jumped out to an early 3–0 lead after the first inning. They added a single run in the fourth inning and 3 in the sixth inning to take a 7–3 lead into the top of the ninth inning. LSU cut the lead to 7–5, but was down to their final out with pre-season All-America selection Blake Dean at the plate. Dean delivered a two-run home run to tie the game at 7. However, in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Bulldogs were able to take advantage of an error to load the bases before Cody Freeman delivered a game-winning single. The Bulldogs evened the series at 1, with a dramatic 8–7 victory.\nIn game 3, LSU seemed more determined than ever to secure the SEC title. The Tigers jumped out to a 6–1 lead after two innings and never looked back. The Tigers endured nearly a two-hour rain delay to win the game by the final score of 15–4. The Tigers were led by sophomore outfielder Leon Landry who blasted three home runs in the contest, finishing a 5 for 6 day at the plate with 7 RBIs. With the win, LSU finished the regular season 41–15 overall, posting a 20–10 mark in conference play. The Ole Miss Rebels also posted a 20–10 mark in conference play, but a series victory over the Rebels earlier in the year gave LSU the No. 1 seed in the 2009 SEC baseball tournament.\nSEC tournament.\nThe 2009 SEC baseball tournament will be held at Regions Park in Hoover, AL from May 20 through 24. The winner of the 2009 tournament will earn the Southeastern Conference's automatic bid to the 2009 NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\nAfter tying Ole Miss as co-champions for the 2009 SEC regular season title, LSU earned the No. 1 seed in the tournament. LSU earned the No. 1 seed over Ole Miss as a result of head-to-head play during the season.\nVanderbilt.\nLSU opened SEC Tournament play against Vanderbilt. After 3 scoreless innings for both teams, Vanderbilt catcher Andrew Giobbi hit a solo home run in the top of the 4th to give the Commodores the lead. Vanderbilt would score another run in the top of the 5th, and add two more in the 7th to extend their lead to 4–0. LSU would score their lone run in the bottom of the 7th, but the 4–1 deficit would prove to be too much for the top seeded Tigers. Vanderbilt starter Mike Minor threw a complete game to help the Commordores advance in the winner's bracket. LSU fell into the loser's bracket and would face Alabama in an elimination game the next day.\n#18 Alabama.\nAfter completing their first game around 2:00 am CST and losing in extra innings, Alabama had a quick turn around to face LSU in their second game in the tournament with the loser being eliminated. LSU jumped out to 1–0 lead after two innings, but in the top of the 3rd Alabama would score 2 runs to take a 2–1 lead. LSU would fight right back in the bottom half with 4 runs to retake the lead 5–2 and extending it in the 4th by another run. In the seventh inning, up 6–3, LSU would receive a pinch hit 3-run home run from Senior Derek Helenihi which would ultimately prove to be the winning hit. LSU starter Anthony Ranaudo went 7+ innings allowing only 4 runs, before turning the ball over to the bullpen. Freshman closer Matty Ott entered the game in the 8th inning with the bases loaded and two outs. He got Tyler Odle to ground out to end the inning, and would close the game out in the 9th. The Tigers won 9–6 and moved on to face South Carolina in another elimination game. Alabama finished the tournament 0–2.\n#25 South Carolina.\nAfter beating Alabama in their first game of the tournament, South Carolina lost by a run after Vanderbilt scored in the top of the 9th inning. Much like their first game against Alabama, their second game also went into the early hours of the next day. The game was very much a pitching duel, with senior ace Louis Coleman on the mound for the Tigers and freshman star Nolan Belcher on the mound for the Gamecocks. Neither team could scratch a run through the first 5 innings, but LSU was able to take advantage of 3 hits in the top of the 6th to take a 2–0 lead. LSU extended the lead in the 8th, scoring 2 more runs, which would complete the scoring for the Tigers. Coleman was able to pitch 8 strong innings allowing a single run in the 8th and earning his 11th win on the season. Freshman Matt Ott once again pitched the 9th to secure the victory for the Tigers, 4–1. As a result of the flipped bracket format, LSU would face Georgia next. LSU would have to beat the Dawgs twice in order to continue playing.\nChampionship: Vanderbilt.\nAfter defeating Georgia twice on Saturday, LSU earned a spot in the SEC Tournament championship game. LSU would face the team it lost to on day 1 of the tournament, Vanderbilt. The Commodores breezed through the tournament, despite being the No. 8 seed, having won their first three games, 4–1, 9–5, and 11–1. Though Vanderbilt had not lost yet in the tournament, the championship game is a winner-take-all format. LSU sent senior LHP Ryan Byrd to the mound, while Vanderbilt countered with Nick Christiani.\nLSU wasted no time taking an early lead. Leon Landry opened the game with a lead-off double, and scored 2 batters later. Byrd was able to hold the Commodores offense in check through the first 3 innings, allowing 2 hits, while Christiani settled in as well after Landry's double. In the fourth inning though LSU extended its lead. Another lead-off double by Micah Gibbs, followed by a Mikie Mahtook single, pushed the score to 2–0. Mahtook scored as well after a stolen base, infield single, and sac fly to give the Tigers a 3–0 lead after 3.5 innings. The fourth inning was also the last inning for Christiani.\nVanderbilt was able to cut the lead to 3–1 in the bottom half of the fourth off a Steven Liddle solo home run, but the Tigers wasted no time getting the run back. In the 5th, LSU was able to score 2 more runs off a walk, another double by Landry, and sac fly by Blake Dean. LSU now held a 5–1 lead and was in complete control of the game. Each team would go on to score another run in the 7th to make the score 6–2 which would prove to be the final score. Byrd pitched one of the best games of his career. He went 7 innings, allowing 5 hits, 2 earned runs, with 3 strikeouts and 1 walk. If was the first game Byrd has pitched in this year where he factored into the decision. It was the second consecutive SEC Tournament championship for LSU and their record 8th overall.\nAfter the tournament, freshman Mikie Mahtook was named the tournament MVP. In the tournament, Mahtook was 10–22 (.454) with 3 RBIs, 2 runs scored, and 17 put outs. Fellow teammates Blake Dean, Austin Nola, and Daniel Bradshaw were also named to the all-tournament team.\nNCAA tournament: Regionals.\nThe regional round of the 2009 NCAA Division I baseball tournament will be played at various hosts sites from May 29 through June 1. The NCAA announced on May 24, 2009, that LSU was selected as the host site for the Baton Rouge regional. There are 16 total sites with 4 teams playing at each site.\nOn Monday May 25, 2009 the NCAA released the post-season bracket for the 2009 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. LSU was announced as the No. 3 overall seed in the tournament.\nSouthern.\nLSU began NCAA tournament play on Friday May 29 against the Southern Jaguars. It didn't take long for Southern to establish a lead. Southern led the game off with a single, followed by a home run to take an early 2–0 lead. Southern held onto the 2–0 lead until LSU was able to plate a single run in the bottom of the 6th. The 2–1 lead would hold only for an inning, as LSU plated 7 runs in the bottom of the seventh to take control of the game. Southern received an excellent outing from starting pitcher Chase Richard who went 6.2 innings giving up 7 hits and allowing 3 runs, 2 earned. LSU would add 2 more runs in the 8th and close out Game 1 of the regional with a 10–2 win.\nNCAA tournament: Super Regionals.\nThe super regional round of the 2009 NCAA Division I baseball tournament was played from June 5 through June 8 at 8 different sites. The host sites were Austin, Baton Rouge, Chapel Hill, Fullerton, Gainesville, Oxford, Tallahassee, and Tempe.\nAs a result of earning the No. 3 overall seed and winning the Baton Rouge Regional, LSU hosted the Rice Owls who advanced out of the Houston Regional. Game 1 was played on Friday June 5, while Game 2 was played the following day on Saturday June 6.\n#6 Rice (Game 1).\nGame 1 of the Baton Rouge super regional featured two dominant right-handed pitchers. LSU handed the ball to sophomore Anthony Ranaudo, while Rice sent junior Mike Ojala to the mound. Rice was able to take the lead early off multiple LSU errors. Rice scored 2 unearned runs in the 2nd and another unearned run in the 4th. LSU would finally get on the board in bottom of the 4th, scoring a single run, but Rice got the run back in the 5th on a solo home run by Steven Sultzbaugh. With half the game complete, Rice held onto a 4–1 lead, but the bottom of the 5th proved to be the turning point. Rice pulled Ojala in favor of Taylor Wall with runners on second and third, no outs and a run already across the plate. Wall was brought in to face lefty Ryan Schimpf, but the move proved to be a costly one. Schimpf sent a ball over the right-center fence to give LSU a 5–4 lead. LSU would tack on 2 additional runs to give the Tigers a 7–4 lead after 5 innings, a lead the Tigers would not give up. Rice would score 2 runs in the 8th and 3 in the 9th for a total of 9 on the night, but LSU pushed 2 more runs across in the 7th and 3 in the 8th to win the game 12–9. LSU would need only one more win to advance to Omaha.\n#6 Rice (Game 2).\nLSU would be the visiting team for the second game of the Baton Rouge super regional. Each team sent their ace to the mound for game 2. LSU was hoping senior RHP Louis Coleman could clinch the super regional for the Tigers while Rice was hoping junior sensation Ryan Berry would extend their season.\nLSU would jump out to an early 1–0 lead in the 1st inning capitalizing on a double and two walks. Rice would tie the game in the 3rd on a solo home run by Brock Holt, who also homered the night before. LSU took the lead back in the 4th inning, but Rice again tied the game at 2 in the bottom half of the inning. The 5th inning would once again prove to be the decisive one in the game. LSU would score 2 runs in the top half of the inning to take the lead, a lead they would hold onto the rest of the game. Each team would score a run in the 6th inning, bringing the score to 5–3. That would be it for scoring in this game. Coleman went 8 strong innings, while Berry only made it through the 5th. LSU freshman closer Matty Ott came in to pitch the 9th, and secure the victory. With the win, LSU advances to the 2009 College World Series. It will be LSU's 15th appearance at the CWS.\nAfter setting an Alex Box record the night before for actual attendance with 9,375, LSU fans once again poured into the stadium to see their Tigers. Game 2 would break the record set the night before as 9,651 witnessed the final game in the new Alex Box Stadium's inaugural season.\nNCAA tournament: College World Series.\nThe 2009 College World Series was held at Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, NE from June 13 through June 24.\nLSU was in Bracket 1 along with Arkansas, Cal St. Fullerton, and Virginia. Bracket 1 began play Saturday June 13. Fullerton squared off with Arkansas in game 1, with LSU against Virginia in game 2.\nBracket 2 began play on Sunday June 14 and included Texas, Southern Miss, North Carolina, and Arizona St.\n#5 Virginia.\nLSU opened up College World Series play in game 2 on Day 1. LSU squared off against the Virginia Cavaliers. A game that matched LSU head coach Paul Mainieri against one of his former assistants Brian O'Connor. Virginia earned a berth in the 2009 College World Series by winning the Fullerton Regional and defeating Ole Miss in the Oxford Super Regional.\nSophomore RHP Anthony Ranaudo opened the game with a 1–2–3 first inning. In the bottom of the first, after getting the first two batters out, Virginia's Danny Hutzen gave up a double to Blake Dean. Micah Gibbs followed Dean's double with an RBI single to give LSU an early 1–0 lead. After both teams failed to score in the second, the Cavaliers were able to take advantage of a couple sacrifices to tie the game at 1. LSU quickly answered in the bottom half of the third scoring 2 runs off 4 hits to regain the lead 3–1. Virginia added a single run in the 4th to close the gap to a run, and took their first ever lead in the CWS in the top of the fifth scoring 2 runs on 4 hits to lead 4–3. Once again though, LSU answered the call. Junior first baseman Sean Ochinko hit a 3-run home run over the left field wall to give LSU a 6–4 lead, a lead they would not give up.\nThe Cavaliers would cut the lead to 6–5 in the 7th inning, but LSU scored 3 more runs in the 8th to extend the lead to 9–6 which would prove to be the final score. The two teams combined for 28 hits. The win moved LSU into the winner's bracket, where they would square off against SEC rival Arkansas in the second round. The Cavaliers next faced Cal. St. Fullerton in an elimination game.\nFinals: No. 4 Texas (Game 1).\nLSU and Texas met for only the third time ever in the College World Series with Texas winning the first meeting back in 1987 and LSU winning the second meeting in 2000. The two teams combined for 11 national championships. The 2009 finals marked LSU's first appearance since 2000 in the College World Series finals and the first time they have made the championship series since it became best 2 out of 3. Texas was returning to the finals for the first time since winning it all back in 2005. It was determined that LSU would be the home team for games 1 and 3 via coin flip. LSU was sending senior RHP Louis Coleman to the mound, while Texas countered with sophomore RHP Chance Ruffin.\nLSU would jump out to an early 1–0 lead in the top of the 1st inning, as Ryan Schimpf crushed a home run over the left-center field fence. After managing only 1 hit in the first 3 innings off Coleman, Texas would get on the board in the bottom of the 4th with 3 solo home runs to take the lead 3–1. Texas would hold on to that lead for only 1 inning, as Jared Mitchell came through for the Tigers with a 2 RBI triple in the 6th to tie the game at 3. Texas would fight right back in the bottom half of the inning with another solo home run and a wild pitch to retake the lead 5–3. Each team would add a run in the 7th, Texas' another solo home run, to give Texas a 6–4 lead. A lead they would hold on to until the top of the 9th.\nDown to the last 3 outs, LSU needed to push 2 runs across to tie the game. Jared Mitchell was first up to bat and quickly grounded out to the shortstop. Junior first baseman Sean Ochinko singled through the left side to bring the tying run to the plate. After the single, Texas would make a pitching change to bring in freshman Taylor Jungmann to face senior third baseman Derek Helenihi. Helenihi who was in a 1–15 slump in the CWS was able to draw a four pitch walk. Freshman Tyler Hanover was brought in to pinch hit, but after getting up 2–0 in the count, Auggie Garrido once again made a pitching change. Brandon Workman was brought in, and would battle to eventually get Hanover to strike out. Down to their last out in game 1 of the finals, LSU's lead off hitter D.J. LeMahieu stepped to the plate with runners on first and second. LeMahieu wasted no time, crushing the first pitch into the left field corner for a 2 RBI double that tied the game. After Ryan Schimpf was intentionally walked, Workman was able to get Blake Dean to fly out to end the top half of the inning. LSU brought in freshman closer Matty Ott to pitch the 9th. After hitting the first batter, Ott was able to record 3 straight outs to send the game into extra innings.\nIn the top of the 10th, LSU loaded the bases with only 1 out, but was unable to push a run across. Ott pitched the bottom half of the 10th, and once again was able to keep the Texas offense in check. D.J. LeMahieu was up first in the 11th, and drew a lead off walk. After getting Schimpf and Dean to fly out, it appeared Workman was going to get out of the inning. With Gibbs up to bat, LeMahieu took off and stole second. A throwing error by the catcher, Cameron Rupp, allowed LeMahieu to advance to third. Workman would intentionally walk Gibbs to set up the force play. Freshman Mikie Mahtook came to the plate having struck out 3 times earlier in the game, but delivered the game-winning hit. Mahtook single back up the middle scoring LeMahieu to put the Tigers up 7–6. LSU would leave Ott in to pitch his 3rd inning of relief work. Ott struck out the first 2 batters he faced, then got Connor Rowe to ground out to second base to secure the victory for the Tigers.\nFinals: No. 4 Texas (Game 2).\nWith LSU looking to claim their 6th national title and Texas facing elimination, the Longhorns sent freshman Taylor Jungmann to the mound. LSU countered with sophomore Austin Ross who hadn't started a game since game 1 of the Baton Rouge regional. Texas was the visiting team for game 2 and wasted no time taking the lead. The Longhorns pieced together a couple hits to go with a throwing error to take a 1–0 lead after the top of the first inning. They added another run in the second off a solo home run by Preston Clark. The 2–0 lead would be all the Jungmann would need. LSU would push their lone run across in the bottom of the second. After singles by Jared Mitchell and Leon Landry, Derek Helenihi hit a ball up the middle that was misplayed by shortstop Brandon Loy. Mitchell would score an unearned run on the play to cut Texas' lead in half.\nRoss was lifted after only pitching 2 innings, but it made no difference. Texas added 3 more runs in the top of third, one coming off a solo home run by Russell Moldenhauer, to extend their lead to 5–1. Those runs ended up being the final scoring for the night for both teams. Texas would finish the game with 12 hits in all, while committing 3 errors. LSU would only manage 5 hits on the evening, and never could take advantage of any opportunities. Longhorn starter, Jungmann, would go on to throw a complete game, striking out 9 and only walking 2. The win forced a rubber match the next for, with the winner of the pivotal game 3 being crowned 2009 NCAA Baseball National Champions.\nFinals: No. 4 Texas (Game 3).\nAfter a complete game effort by Jungmann the night before, Texas was hoping sophomore starter Cole Green would be able to put forth a similar effort. LSU countered with sophomore ace Anthony Ranaudo who was making his third start in the College World Series. LSU was once again the home team, and wasted no time taking the early lead. After recording two quick outs, Green hit Blake Dean with a pitch to keep the inning alive. Junior Sean Ochinko was up next and singled through the left side. First-round draft pick Jared Mitchell stepped to the plate. With one swing of the bat he gave the Tigers the early lead sending a 3-run home run over the right field fence. In the bottom half of the inning, Ranaudo pitched around 2 singles and a walk to get out of a bases loaded jam with no damage done. In the second inning LSU extended their lead to 4–0 after piecing together 3 hits in the inning, but the lead did not last long.\nTexas took advantage of a couple walks and 2 big hits to cut LSU's lead in half, but Texas once again left the bases loaded. After neither team scored in the 4th inning, it was once again Texas' turn to bat in the 5th still down 4–2. A lead-off single by Cameron Rupp brought the tying run to the plate. Kevin Keyes delivered by sending a 2-run home run over the left field bleachers tying the game at 4 runs apiece.\nThe top of the 6th inning proved to be the turning point in the game. LSU took advantage of 2 walks, 2 hit batters, an error, and 2 hits to score a total of 5 runs. LSU now held a 9–4 lead, a lead they would not let go of. LSU starter Anthony Ranaudo pitched 5.1 innings, giving up 8 hits, 4 runs, and 5 walks, but still got the win to improve his record to 12–3 on the season. Sophomore Chad Jones pitched 1.2 hitless innings while striking out 2 batters. LSU would extend their lead to 10–4 after a double, single, and sac fly in the inning. Coach Mainieri brought in senior Louis Coleman to pitch the 8th inning. Coleman was able to work around a 1-out double to get out of the inning without giving up a run. LSU added another run in the 9th off a solo home run by Ochinko to extend the lead to 11–4. Coleman was brought back out to finish the game off. After a lead-off walk, Coleman struck out the side to secure the victory.\nThe victory marked the 6th national championship for LSU baseball, the first since 2000. It was also the first championship for head coach Paul Mainieri. LSU finished the season 56–17.\nAwards and honors.\nDaniel Bradshaw\nLouis Coleman\nBlake Dean\nMicah Gibbs\nD. J.

        "title": "Australian cricket team in India in 2008–09",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured India from 27 September to 10 November 2008 and played four test matches, for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. During the second test match in Mohali Sachin Tendulkar became the first person to make 12,000 runs in Test cricket breaking Brian Lara's record of 11,953 runs. Sachin described \"It is definitely the biggest achievement in 19 years of my career\" on the day he achieved the record. India's 320 run victory in the second test match was also their biggest win against Australia in terms of runs, eclipsing the 222-run victory that came in Melbourne in 1977 and their biggest test win ever in terms of runs. In the first innings of the third test match in Delhi, Gautam Gambhir and V. V. S. Laxman became the first Indian players to both score a double century in a test innings. This series also witnessed the last Tests of two Indian cricketers – Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly.\nSecurity concerns and controversy before the tour.\nBefore the Australian cricket team was scheduled to tour India and play a series of Test matches, one-day internationals and Twenty20 matches, it was doubtful if the Australian cricket team would tour India after the terror attacks in Delhi and the press briefing given by India's National Security Advisor M. K. Narayan that raised issues of security concern in the minds of Australia's cricketers.\nOn 13 September 2008, serial bomb blasts took place in India's capital city Delhi in which 30 people died and over 100 people were injured. The very next day after the blasts, Cricket Australia (CA) issued a statement saying that it would review the security situation in the wake of the blasts and make its decision the next week after performing a risk assessment. The Board of Control for Cricket in India, however, asserted that the blast would have no bearing on the cricket tour which would go ahead as scheduled. However, a conflicting report made on 15 September claimed that the CA had briefed that the tour was on track. Following these reports, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lashed at the Australian cricket establishment for agreeing to tour India while postponing their tour to Pakistan in early 2008 and accused the Board of adopting double standards. One PCB official even called the Australians \"lilly-livered cowards\" But Ricky Ponting issued a statement vindicating CA's stand by saying that the circumstances accompanying the cancellation of Australia's tour of Pakistan were entirely different. before adding on 17 September that the tour was not confirmed yet and that it could go either way.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nAustralia batted first and centuries from Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey makes them put a score of 430 Indian pacer Zaheer Khan took five wickets. India reply with 360 with half centuries from Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh . Australia declared their second innings at 228/6 setting up India a target of 299 in the final day of play and India batsmen played carefully to end the match to draw. \nZaheer Khan was awarded Man Of the Match for his all-round performance in the match.\n2nd Test.\nPrior to the Second Test starting on 17 October in Mohali, Australian opening batsman Phil Jaques (who did not play in the opening Test) was sent home after failing to overcome a back injury. He was replaced in the squad by Shaun Marsh, who had opened the batting in the recently concluded One Day Internationals against the West Indies and had been the leading run-scorer in the 2008 Indian Premier League. Victorian fast-bowler Peter Siddle made his international debut, after Stuart Clark injured his elbow. \nHeavy rains interrupted pitch preparations for the Test, and curator Daljit Singh said, \"Heavy rains came down as recently as 4 October and water, two and a half feet deep, collected on the surface which initially affected our ground preparations.\" The tourists had never played a Test at the venue; however, Indian batsmen Laxman, Sehwag, Dravid, Ganguly and Tendulkar all averaged over 50 at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium.\nWinning the toss and batting, India reached 5/311 by stumps on the opening day, and despite the rain, the pitch was flat with \"hardly any swing or movement\", enabling the batsmen to hit through the line of the ball. During the day, Sachin Tendulkar became Test cricket's highest run-scorer when he steered a Siddle delivery down to third-man for three. He overtook former West Indian batsman Brian Lara's previous record of 11,953 runs.\nHowever, Australia struggled and managed 268 only after the last three wickets put on more than 100. India dominated for the rest of this match and Australia could barely keep up in this record-setting match.\n3rd Test.\nIndia batted for almost two days to set themselves up in a dominant position. However the Australians were able to bat for another two days and save the test. The Indians declared late on the final day to give the retiring Anil Kumble a few final overs.\n4th Test.\nThis game see-sawed throughout and going into the final day Australia were chasing a large target for victory, however in spite of some good early batting from Matthew Hayden amongst others, the target and the fifth day pitch proved too much for the Australians. The match also saw some unusual (and controversial) tactics on the fourth day by the Australians. Following the Tea Break, they were in a dominant position, however they were a long way behind on their over rate. So to prevent a one match suspension to captain Ricky Ponting, they chose to bowl their part-time bowlers such as Michael Clarke and Mike Hussey (who were both unsuccessful in capturing a wicket), to make it up. This drew strong criticism from many commentators, who suggested that their faster bowlers could have bowled from a shorter run-up. This was also the last test match for Sourav Ganguly."

The final was held in Bangkok for the second consecutive time, and third overall.\nThere were twelve spots in each of the ten events. The defending champion from the 2007 World Cup Final and all medalists of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing qualified automatically for Bangkok. The remaining eight qualified through a special point-awarding system based on their best performance during the World Cup season, skipping past automatic qualifiers. Not counting the defending champion and the Olympic medalists, there was a maximum of two shooters per event from the same country.\nThe qualification system awarded a win with 15 points, a silver medal with 10, a bronze medal with 8, a fourth place with 5, a fifth with 4, a sixth with 3, a seventh with 2 and an eighth place with 1 point. It also gave out points for qualification scores within a certain range from the current world record: from 1 point for fourteen points off the record, to 15 points for equalling or raising it.\nMen's 50 metre rifle prone.\nQualification.\nTamas did not participate and was replaced by Valérian Sauveplane.\nMen's 10 metre air rifle.\nQualification.\nBindra did not participate.\nMen's 50 metre pistol.\nQualification.\nTan did not participate.\nMen's 25 metre rapid fire pistol.\nQualification.\nAlifirenko, Pupo and Raicea did not participate and were replaced by Cha Sang-jun, Alexey Klimov and Taras Magmet.\nWomen's 50 metre rifle three positions.\nQualification.\nEmmons did not participate.

        "title": "Glamorganshire Golf Club",
        "text": "Glamorganshire Golf Club is located in Lower Penarth in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, 7.3 miles (11.7 kilometres) south west from the capital city of Cardiff and is one of the oldest golf clubs in Wales. The club was founded by the Earl of Plymouth.\nThe club played a leading role in the founding of the Welsh Golf Union, and it twice hosted the Welsh Amateur Championship as well as the Welsh Ladies inaugural Championships in it early years.\nIn 1898 the club was the testing ground of Dr Frank Stableford's new Stableford revolutionary golf scoring system still used today.\nAlthough near the sea, the Glamorganshire course is not a links, but an 18-hole parkland course on gently undulating ground at the eastern edge of what is now Cosmeston Lakes Country Park.\nFoundation.\nIn 1890 the Earl of Plymouth gifted an extensive plot of land in Lower Penarth and the club was founded initially as a nine-hole course. The club undertook an expansion programme to the full eighteen-hole course during 1896 and the following year enabling the 1897 Welsh Amateur Championship to take place in Penarth for the first time.\nThe Stableford scoring system.\nThe Stableford method of golf scoring, a system now utilised and revered, particularly by amateur golfers, the world over, was first devised by a Glamorganshire club member, Dr. Frank Barney Gordon Stableford. He first tried it out on fellow members of the club on 30 September 1898.\nPrior to this revolutionary experiment here was no stroke indexing system available to golfers. Essentially all holes were played to par and the ‘Stableford’ points applied. At the end of the game one third of the players handicap was added to the overall ‘Stableford’ adjusted score. The maximum handicap for the event was fifteen. The new system obviously favoured the better golfer at the time which is hardly surprising as the good doctor was a single figure handicapper.\nStableford himself did not actually participate in his initial experiment though he donated a special prize to the winner, Mr W Hastings Watson, who scored a remarkable forty two points. There is no indication of what the members thought about the alternative of scoring by points or, indeed, whether they tried it out on any other occasions.\nDr Stableford, who was a resident of Whitchurch, Cardiff at the time, left the Glamorganshire Golf Club when he set off to serve as an Army Surgeon in the Boer War. On his return to Wales he joined the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club where he won the Royal Porthcawl Championship in 1907 and in the same year reached the semi -final of the Welsh Amateur Championship.\nThe Barbarians rugby football club.\nIt is probable that no other golf club in the world can lay claim to have hosted so many great rugby players from all over the world, because the famous Barbarians visited the Glamorganshire club every Easter Sunday between 1901 and 1996 as part of their traditional Easter weekend touring fixtures against famous Welsh clubs.\nTheir Sunday 'official golf frolic' is regarded a major part of the Barbarians legend and, in the eyes of most of their players, was almost of equal importance to the weekend's rugby. The competitive sporting drive of the rugby stars was as evident on the golf course as it was on any rugby field.\nIn 1924–25 in recognition of the generosity of the golf club, ninety five Barbarian members subscribed a total of £52.17s.0d for a 95-ounce perpetual silver cup called the Barbarians Challenge Cup, to be completed for annually by club members on Easter Monday to commemorate the eagerly anticipated Easter visits by the Barbarians.\nThe mounted head of a Springbok, presented to the Barbarians team after they defeated the South African national team in 1961, remains on display in the golf club's bar to this day.\nMilitary.\nDuring World War II Glamorganshire Golf Course was the location of an experimental rocket battery as part of the town's air defences. The battery was manned by 50 soldiers from the Royal Artillery who were billeted in a small 'village' of Nissen huts built in the club's grounds. Unannounced practice firings of the rocket battery frequently caused concern and alarm amongst local residents. Several public air raid shelters, for Lower Penarth residents and workers at the Cement Factory, were constructed in the club grounds and on the land that now forms part of Cosmeston Country Park.\nGuy Gibson VC.\nGuy Gibson the leader of the legendary Dam Busters raid over Germany in World War II, was not only an honorary member of Glamorganshire Golf Club but when the news came that he had been awarded the Victoria Cross he celebrated that night in the clubhouse.\nWing Commander Gibson's association with Glamorganshire began when the air ace met a young Penarthian, Eve Moore, at a party in Coventry during early December 1939 while he was on three days rest leave at his brother's house.\nThe following year Gibson and Eve were married at All Saints Church in Penarth. Guy Gibson flew his Blenheim bomber from his airbase in Lincolnshire to RAF Pengam Moors for the wedding.\nEve's parents, Mr and Mrs Ernest Moore, lived in Archer Road, Penarth, and the couple moved in with them while they considered buying a home of their own. Ernest Moore was a keen golfer and invited his new son-in-law to join the Glamorganshire club as an honorary member.\nAfter the Dambusters raid took place in May 1943, widely hailed as a turning point of the War, Gibson spent his two-week post-raid leave in Penarth, playing golf on most days. While he was on that leave he had a call from the Air Ministry telling him that he had been awarded the VC. Ernest Moore immediately telephoned the steward at Glamorganshire and asked to lay on as many drinks as he could find and the whole family went down to celebrate in style at the clubhouse.\nGibson was an enthusiastic golfer and often returned to his favourite course at the Glamorganshire club while on leave until his death."

It has hosted many One Day Internationals (ODIs) including a match in the 1999 Cricket World Cup, and the 2004 Videocon Cup between India, Pakistan and Australia. It was also used in the 1990 ICC Trophy, the first to be played outside England.\nVRA Cricket Ground has hosted some notable moments in Dutch cricket, including a three-run win for the Netherlands over an England XI that featured future England captains Alec Stewart and Nasser Hussain in 1989. In July 2006, the Netherlands played Sri Lanka in their first home ODI and the visitors scored 443/9 from their 50 overs, which then was the highest team total in ODI cricket.\nLocated in Amsterdamse Bos, the main ground features a AAA standard turf wicket, while the second and third grounds have an artificial wicket and are used in the winter by Amsterdamsche Hockey &amp; Bandy Club.\nThe stadium hosted a One Day International (ODI) match during the 1999 Cricket World Cup, between South Africa and Kenya. It was hosted host Nepal's first ever ODI during their Netherlands tour in August 2018.\nEngland scored 498 runs against the Netherlands in June 2022, setting a new record for the highest-ever ODI team score."

The head coach was Bill Self, serving his 6th year. The team played its home games in Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas, and were the defending National Champions. The AP poll released on January 26, 2009, had the Jayhawks unranked, which was the last poll in which the Jayhawks were not ranked until February 8, 2021. The following week, Kansas entered the rankings at number 21, beginning what is the longest streak in Men's Basketball history with 223 consecutive polls being ranked and achieved that record on November 30, 2020. They are 2 ahead of UCLA's 221 straight weeks that was done from 1967 to 1980.\nPre-Season.\nThe 2007–08 Jayhawks finished the season 37–3 overall with a 13–3 mark in conference play. They won the Big 12 regular season men's basketball championship, which they shared with the Texas Longhorns. In post season play, the Jayhawks won the Big 12 conference tournament championship and received a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. The team went on to win the national championship, 75–68, in overtime vs. the Memphis Tigers. The Jayhawks finished the season #1 in the final Coaches Poll after the tournament and were ranked 5th in the final AP Poll before the tournament. The team raised a temporary NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship banner to the rafters in an official ceremony to celebrate its 2008 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament victory during Late Night in the Phog event. The official championship and final four banners were raised during the November 18 game against Florida Gulf Coast.\nThe Jayhawks lost five scholarship seniors from their national title team in addition to three underclassmen (Brandon Rush, Mario Chalmers, and Darrell Arthur) who opted to enter the NBA draft and eventually signed with agents. Returning from the national championship team are stars Sherron Collins, point guard, and Cole Aldrich, center. Other players returning are: seniors Matt Kleinmann and Brennan Bechard, and sophomores Brady Morningstar, Chase Buford, Tyrel Reed, and Connor Teahan.\nRecruiting.\nCoach Self signed seven recruits for the 2008–09 season. The class was led by New Jersey twins Marcus and Markieff Morris who both played the power forward position. Another signee from New Jersey was Quintrell Thomas, who also played the power forward position. Travis Releford, a Kansas City product was the first signee for the Jayhawks and was in the mix for departed star Brandon Rush's spot in the starting rotation. Coach Self also managed to lure point guard Tyshawn Taylor to Lawrence, after he was released from his letter of intent to play for Marquette. The Jayhawks also signed junior college transfers Tyrone Appleton and Mario Little.\nSeason summary.\nKansas finished the regular season 25–6 (14–2). After being picked to tie for 3rd in the conference in preseason, the Jayhawks defied expectations and won their 5th straight Big 12 conference championship and 52nd overall.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=|Summer Canadian Exhibition Games\n!colspan=12 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=|Big 12 Tournament \n!colspan=12 style=|NCAA Tournament "

        "text": "Benjamin Lucas (born 30 December 1987) is an Australian rugby union player who used to play for Montpellier as a fly-half in the Top 14.\nCareer.\nEducated at Robertson State School, then St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace Lucas is a former Australian schoolboy representative.\nLucas caught the eye of then Australian coach John Connolly when he claimed a personal tally of 35 points in the Brisbane club competition final where his club Sunnybank beat the Gold Coast by 85–19, Lucas creating nearly every play from Fly Half.\nLucas missed out on 2007 Rugby World Cup selection after inside back Berrick Barnes secured the last spot, but was invited to train with the Queensland Reds in preparation for the 2008 Super 14 season. Reds coach Phil Mooney switched Lucas to halfback after injury to halfback Sam Cordingley and Will Genia. Lucas was selected in the Australia A for the Pacific Nations Cup, then selected as starting flyhalf for the first game against Japan. He was expected to be selected in Australia's team for the Tri Nations, his versatility of being able to play quality rugby at both halfback and flyhalf to work in his favour as Australia lack quality depth in both positions off the bench. However, he was not included in the Wallabies squad.\nIn 2009 a rib injury sidelined Lucas, which allowed Genia to regain the Reds No 9 jersey. End of season injuries saw Lucas switch to fullback against the Crusaders, then Lucas switch back halfback at the end of the season after Genia was sidelined.\nWhile Lucas continued to show versatility in 2010, Genia's form, consistency and leadership kept him ahead of Lucas in the halfback role, and Genia also assumed the captaincy as well, after a season-ending injury to James Horwill in the first game of the year. Lucas' versatility however kept him in the squad, and he signed another two-year contract. Lucas continued at fullback, including a solid effort in the Reds victory over the Highlanders in the final round at Suncorp Stadium. However, Lucas left the field prematurely with a knee injury. In the 2011 Super Rugby season Lucas become a regular fullback for the Reds, substituting for injured regular fullback Peter Hynes. However, in 2011 Wallabies selection continued to elude him, and despite recognition of his utility value he was overlooked for the Rugby World Cup."

        "title": "College Basketball on NBC Sports",
        "text": "College Basketball on NBC Sports is the de facto branding used for broadcasts of NCAA Division I men's college basketball games produced by NBC Sports, the sports division of the NBC television network in the United States. The NBC network broadcast college basketball games in some shape or form between 1969 and 1998. From 1969 to 1981, NBC covered the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. It became the first major network to broadcast the championship game, at a cost of more than US$500,000 in 1969.\nIn 2011, Comcast's sports channel Versus became part of NBC Sports after the company's acquisition of NBC Universal, and was relaunched as NBC Sports Network (NBCSN) in 2012. During the 2010's, NBCSN primarily carried coverage of basketball from the Atlantic 10 Conference, Colonial Athletic Association (CAA), and Ivy League.\nNBCSN would lose the CAA and Ivy League, but retained its A-10 package. It was renewed in 2021 under a multi-year deal, and moved to USA Network in January 2022 after the shutdown of NBCSN. In August 2022, NBC Sports announced that it had acquired rights to Big Ten basketball as part of a larger agreement with the conference, with a package of games airing on Peacock beginning in the 2023–24 season.\nOn November 12, 2022, college basketball returned to the main NBC network when the Notre Dame women's college basketball team took on the California women's college basketball team as part of the inaugural Citi Shamrock Classic. It was the first women's college basketball game to ever air on NBC, and the first college basketball game of any kind since 1998.\nHistory.\nNBC's relationship with college basketball dates as far back as February 28, 1940, when W2XBS (the future flagship station for NBC, WNBC) presented a doubleheader at New York City's Madison Square Garden. The University of Pittsburgh faced off against Fordham University, followed by Georgetown University against New York University.\n1969–1976.\nFor NBC's first year of tournament coverage in 1969, the network aired the consolation game nationally and the national semi-finals on a regional basis (which were held on a Thursday night). 1972 marked the final year that NBC aired the consolation game. The following year marked the first time that the \"Final Four\" was held on a Saturday, and was the first prime time championship game to air on NBC.\nFrom 1969 to 1972, Final Four contests were split national telecasts. Because the NCAA Tournament wasn't seeded, but based on geography, the Final Four generally had two eastern and two western teams. NBC, with a prime-time slot, televised the eastern-oriented game in the east, and the western-oriented game in the west. It essentially was a split-national telecast, with the split occurring over the time, not simultaneous games. This inevitably created problems, such as when Louisville played UCLA in the late game in 1972, people in the east didn't see it. And, if the first game went into overtime, NBC couldn't close out the eastern window and open the western window. The western United States would get the end of the early game, but the east would still not get to see the late game. The secondary problem was that the east didn't get to see UCLA in the tournament until the title game.\nBy 1974, NBC was providing coverage of nine games in seven windows (a far cry from the current tournament coverage). 1974 also marked the first year that Billy Packer helped commentate an NCAA tournament game, starting a streak continued well into the 2000s. The following year, NBC aired ten games in nine windows – presenting the regional finals as a tripleheader with regional coverage in the middle time slot; this was also the first year that Billy Packer covered the Final Four. The 1974 NCAA tournament started the afternoon of March 9 with a doubleheader on NBC. The ACC and Pac 8 had first round byes, and these leagues were still staging conference tournament and regular season action after the NCAA tournament started.\nNBC did not start airing regular season games until about 1975–76, when the network partnered with the ad-hoc sports service TVS Television Network. While NBC Sports' on-air talent was used, the production was covered by TVS. By this point, NBC would air regional and national games on Saturdays, and national games (called by Dick Enberg, Al McGuire and Billy Packer) on Sundays. As for the regional telecasts on Saturdays, typically in the Northeast, before the game featuring the Big East or Atlantic 10 conferences, it was the \"ECAC Game of the Week\".\nIn Dick Enberg's book \"Oh My!\", he says that the first time that he worked with Billy Packer was on a UCLA-Maryland game in 1974. Meanwhile, Packer's book \"Hoops\" says that the first time these two worked together was on a UCLA @ Maryland game on Super Bowl Sunday 1975. Packer however, is incorrect on the date because these teams did not play on January 12, 1975 (nor on any other Super Bowl Sunday for that matter) and there was no national college basketball telecast on this date either. Packer spends a few pages on this telecast which he says was a joint production between TVS and Chesley and talks about meeting Enberg for the first time earlier that day. He also says that Enberg called play-by-play for one half and Jim Thacker did play-by-play for the other half and that Packer was the analyst throughout.\nFor the 1975 tournament, NBC expanded the regional finals coverage to present a tripleheader with regionalized coverage in the middle time slot. NBC used Tim Ryan and Al McGuire in the studio on March 22. 1975 also marked the first year that Billy Packer would work on the Final Four.\nCoverage of the 1976 tournament served as an awkward transition period from Curt Gowdy to Dick Enberg. Although Enberg was NBC's lead college basketball play-by-play announcer during the regular season, Gowdy had a clause in his contract to do the NCAA championship game. As a compromise, NBC decided to put each of them on one national semi-final game along with Billy Packer. Then for the title game, both play-by-play voices worked together while Packer was relegated to the network's New York City studio (where he worked with Bryant Gumbel and Lee Leonard).\n1977–1981.\nFor the 1976–77 season, NBC moved the national games to Sundays, starting with a doubleheader on January 2-Michigan @ South Carolina then Houston @ UCLA. NBC provided split-national coverage of two games each on February 6 (Providence @ Louisville and Marquette @ Cincinnati) and February 20 (North Carolina @ Virginia and Indiana @ Purdue). NBC added a Saturday game on the last weekend of the season to show undefeated San Francisco take on Notre Dame. That weekend, Billy Packer called three ACC tournament games in Greensboro on Thursday March 3, both ACC semi-finals the next night, then went to South Bend to call San Francisco-Notre Dame game on Saturday afternoon. He went back to Greensboro to call the ACC title game that same night, and then went to Ann Arbor to call the Marquette-Michigan game the next day.\nNBC added first round Sunday coverage during the 1977 tournament. \nIn the 1977–78 season, C.D. Chesley (who controlled the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) rights at the time) wanted NBC to televise select ACC games as part of its national package as it had the previous few years. However, NBC wanted to feature intersectional games. This action greatly upset Chesley, who wound up selling the rights to the ACC Tournament final to ABC. As a result, there was a notable absence of ACC home games in NBC's college basketball schedule for the 1977–78 season. For this season, NBC added Al McGuire to the No. 1 team alongside Dick Enberg and Billy Packer. Early in the season, NBC stationed McGuire in a remote location and went to him only for periodic commentary. Eventually, NBC moved McGuire courtside to form a three-man announcer team. Dick Stockton filled in for Enberg on at least three games, Kentucky vs. Notre Dame (at Louisville on December 31), Marquette @ South Carolina (on February 5), and North Carolina @ Providence (on February 12). Enberg called the in Denver on January 1 and had a boxing assignment on February 5.\nIn 1978, NBC aired all regional finals games nationally for the first time, moving two of the games to Sunday. NBC split up the analysts from its No. 1 announcer team for the first two weekends of the tournament. Al McGuire for the most part, worked with Curt Gowdy while Billy Packer generally worked with Dick Enberg. While Dick Enberg served as the play-by-play announcer for NBC's Final Four coverage in 1978, Curt Gowdy moved over to a hosting role for the Final Four coverage. Meanwhile, NCAA Productions covered all tournament games not televised by NBC. Merle Harmon, Jim Ferguson, Connie Alexander, Bill Strannigan, Jay Randolph, Gary Thompson, and Fred Taylor were the commentators for NCAA Productions. NCAA Productions carried also the consolation game with Jay Randolph and Gary Thompson on the call.\nOn February 25, 1979, NBC added a game featuring the undefeated Indiana State (which went up against Wichita State on that particular day). This was the first time that Larry Bird played on a national basketball telecast. Also in 1979, the tournament expanded to add Thursday and Friday first-round games (done by NCAA Productions, which also again produced the regional semi-finals). Like it did the previous year, NBC split up the analysts from its primary announcer team for the first two weekends of the tournament, with Jim Simpson (in his last year with NBC before moving on to the newly launched ESPN cable network) working with Billy Packer while Dick Enberg worked with Al McGuire.\nOn December 30, Dick Enberg called an , so Simpson filled in him on the Kentucky-Notre Dame game (which was aired on tape delay at 11:30 p.m. Eastern time) at Louisville. Jim Simpson also filled-in for Enberg on the USC @ Texas game on January 20 because Enberg was scheduled to anchor NBC's Super Bowl coverage the next day.\nNBC's coverage of the 1979 NCAA championship game between Indiana State and Michigan State to this day, remains the highest-rated game (garnering a 24.1 rating) in the history of televised college basketball. The final game marked the beginning of the rivalry between future Hall of Famers Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Both Johnson and Bird would enter the NBA in the fall of 1979, and the rivalry between them and their respective teams (the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics) was a major factor in the league's renaissance in the 1980s and 1990s. The game also led to the \"modern era\" of college basketball, as it introduced a nationwide audience to a sport that was once relegated to second-class status in the sports world.\nBoth Dick Enberg and Don Criqui called the weekend of December 29, 1979, so Charlie Jones filled in on the Kentucky-Notre Dame game (aired on tape delay). Enberg however, did not have an NFL assignment the weekend of December 15 (NBC aired DePaul @ UCLA) while Criqui did (Jets-Oilers). The February 17 game between Kentucky and UNLV, was a Sunday morning local start.\nFor two December games in 1980, Bob Costas filled in for Enberg (who was on NFL duty). The games were Indiana @ North Carolina (on the 20th) and UCLA @ DePaul the following week. Meanwhile, Charlie Jones filled in for Enberg on January 24 (Notre Dame @ Maryland) as Enberg was getting ready to call the Super Bowl the next day. On Super Bowl Sunday 1981, NBC broadcast the Ohio State-Virginia game (with Don Criqui doing play-by-play)at 1:30 pm. ET.\nFor the 1980 tournament, NBC only split up the analysts from its No. 1 announcer team for the first weekend. While Dick Enberg again teamed with Al McGuire, Billy Packer was this time, paired with Don Criqui.\nIn NBC's final year covering the NCAA tournament, 1981 (beginning on March 14 to be exact), the network introduced a policy of switching from game to game (and buzzer beater to buzzer beater, for that matter) on the fly. Before this, NBC would naturally, stay with the regionally-televised games to their conclusion. Bryant Gumbel was the studio host for NBC by this point. This time, NBC kept its No. 1 announcer team (Enberg/Packer/McGuire) intact for the entire tournament.\nAfter losing the Division I basketball tournament rights (1982–1989).\nAfter NBC lost the tournament rights to CBS (which started a separate regular season package) beginning in 1982, they continued with TVS through 1983, wrapping up with the ACC Tournament Final (which NBC had traditionally wrapped up their coverage with, by this point).\nAfter TVS went back to broadcasting separate, regional games beginning in 1983–84 (in the 1986–87 season for instance, NBC carried several Pac-10 telecasts on a regional basis), NBC was left to pick up the games that CBS did not want (save for the ACC Final) for the rest of the 1980s.\nDuring this period, NBC's promotional slogan for its game broadcasts was \"College basketball, it's the \"stuff\" Saturdays are made of!\" Another slogan that NBC used in game promotions was \"Sunday \"come on home\" to college basketball on NBC!\"\nOn January 27, 1985, Jim Valvano (who was still the NC State coach) called a game between Indiana and Illinois alongside Bob Costas for NBC after coaching a game the previous day.\nOn January 25, 1986, NBC had planned regional coverage of LSU @ Auburn in the 1 p.m. (Eastern) time slot (with Jack Givens as analyst). However, that game was postponed due to a chicken pox epidemic on the LSU campus, so NBC went national with the Louisville @ Kansas game (called by Jay Randolph and Bucky Waters). NBC used Pete Maravich on a few late season games such as DePaul @ UCLA on March 1 alongside Don Criqui.\nDick Enberg did not call a college basketball game for the 1989–90 season until February 24 (Georgia Tech @ Notre Dame).\nDecline (1990–1998).\nWith CBS and ESPN gaining strength in the 1990s, all NBC could put together was a 4–5 game package featuring a then-mediocre Notre Dame program. By the 1992–93 season, NBC only broadcast two games, both involving Notre Dame (a February 6 contest against Duke, and a February 13 contest against Kentucky). NBC was seeing much more success with its broadcasts of Notre Dame football games than the team's basketball telecasts by this point.\nOn February 22, 1992, Al McGuire called his last game for NBC (UCLA @ Notre Dame). CBS signed McGuire for the NCAA tournament. In the 1993–94 season, NBC only aired one game, which was UCLA @ Notre Dame on February 5. Don Criqui called that particular game alongside John Andariese. As previously mentioned, the season prior, NBC only carried two games, Duke @ Notre Dame on February 6 (which Don Criqui called with Quinn Buckner) and Kentucky @ Notre Dame on February 13.\nIn the meantime, NBC also aired the Wooden Classic from 1994 to 1996, as well as occasionally showing non-Notre Dame related games such as those between the Oklahoma Sooners and Kansas Jayhawks in 1991, Virginia Cavaliers and North Carolina Tar Heels in 1992, Syracuse Orange-West Virginia Mountaineers in 1997 and 1998, and the Boston College Eagles and Georgetown Hoyas in 1998.\nFor the 1995 edition of the Wooden Classic, ABC regionally televised the first half of the doubleheader (Villanova vs. Purdue) with Roger Twibell and Dick Vitale on the call. At approximately 3:45 pm. Eastern time, NBC broadcast Maryland vs. UCLA for the second half with Don Criqui and Bill Walton on the call. On December 7, 1996, the first game of the Wooden Classic doubleheader (Utah vs. Arizona) tipped off at 1:45 pm, but NBC joined the action in progress at 2 p.m. for most of the country. This time, Don Criqui and Bill Walton were joined by Ann Meyers on commentary.\nNBC's final men's college basketball broadcast to date was a February 28, 1998 contest between Notre Dame and the Providence Friars. NBC continues to maintain a broadcasting relationship with the university as it airs all Notre Dame football home games and select away games.\nCoverage on cable and Peacock, Big Ten package (2011-present).\nWhen Comcast and NBC Universal merged in 2011, college basketball on Versus was integrated into NBC Sports with the channel's relaunch as NBC Sports Network (NBCSN) on January 1, 2012. In 2012, NBC Sports reached agreements to carry Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) basketball and football on NBCSN and Comcast SportsNet, Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) basketball on NBCSN, and renewed NBCSN's rights to the Ivy League for two additional seasons. By the late-2010s, NBC Sports had lost the CAA and Ivy League to other broadcasters.\nNBCSN continued its relationship with the A-10, which was most recently renewed in January 2021 under a multi-year deal. 25 regular season games are broadcast per-season, as well as selected games from the Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament. NBCSN shut down at the end of 2021, after which USA Network assumed its A-10 broadcasts (among other sports properties).\nIn August 2022, NBC Sports announced that it had reached a seven-year deal to carry Big Ten Conference athletics on its platforms, which will include a package of Big Ten men's and women's basketball games on Peacock beginning in the 2023–24 season. Peacock will air up to 47 men's basketball games and 30 women's basketball games per-season (including 32 and 20 intraconference games respectively), as well as the opening night doubleheaders of the men's and women's conference tournaments.\nNBC Sports carried two inaugural showcase games during the 2022–23 season; NBC aired the Citi Shamrock Classic on November 12, 2022, between Notre Dame and California's women's basketball teams. It marked the first women's college basketball game to ever air on NBC, and its first college basketball game overall since 1998. Peacock would sponsor and air the Peacock Classic on December 2, 2022, between Baylor and Gonzaga—a rematch of the 2021 national championship game.\nFor the 2023–24 season, it was announced that Noah Eagle, Jac Collinsworth, and Terry Gannon would be the primary play-by-play broadcasters for Big Ten men's basketball, while Robbie Hummel and Stephen Bardo will be the primary game analysts. Additionally, Paul Burmeister, Steve Burkowski, Rich Lerner, and Steve Schlanger would provide play-by-play on select games, while Tre Demps would be an additional game analyst. For Big Ten women's basketball, Zora Stephenson, Cindy Brunson, and Sloane Martin were announced as play-by-play broadcasters, with Meghan McKeown and Julianne Viani serving as game analysts. Ahmed Fareed was announced as studio host for Big Ten men's coverage, working with studio analysts Josh Pastner, and Jordan Cornette, while Carolyn Manno was announced as the studio host for Big Ten women's coverage, with studio analysts Aliyah Boston and Meghan McKeown. Along with Big Ten basketball, Peacock also announced they would air the Indy Classic and the final day of the Philadelphia Big 5, the latter of which will also be simulcast on NBC Sports Philadelphia Plus.\nAnnouncers.\nFormer commentator pairings.\nAs previously mentioned, NBC and TVS were partners in televising college basketball from 1975 to 1983. Typically on Saturdays, NBC and TVS would broadcast a regional slate of college basketball from the various conferences."

        "title": "2022 FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The 2022 FIFA World Cup was the 22nd FIFA World Cup, the world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA. It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.\nThis tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate, the event was held in November and December instead of during the traditional months of May, June, or July. It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.\nArgentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well as being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002. French player Kylian Mbappé became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 final and won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament. Argentine captain Lionel Messi was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball. The tournament has been considered exceptionally poetic as the capstone of his career, for some commentators fulfilling a previously unmet criterion to be regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. Teammates Emiliano Martínez and Enzo Fernández won the Golden Glove, awarded to the tournament's best goalkeeper; and the Young Player Award, awarded to the tournament's best young player, respectively. With 172 goals, the tournament set a record for the highest number of goals scored in the 32-team format, with every participating team scoring at least one goal. Morocco became the first African nation to top Group stages with 7 points.\nThe choice to host the World Cup in Qatar attracted significant criticism, with concerns raised over the country's treatment of migrant workers, women, and members of the LGBT community, as well as Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.\nFormat.\nThe FIFA World Cup is a professional football tournament held between national football teams, organised by FIFA. The tournament, held every four years, was first played in 1930 in Uruguay, and has been contested by 32 teams since the 1998 event. The tournament was contested with eight round-robin groups followed by a knockout round for 16 teams. The defending champions were France, who defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final. The event was scheduled to take place under a reduced length, from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar. Being held in Qatar, it was the first World Cup tournament to be held in the Arab world. Spectators were not required to follow most COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.\nSchedule.\nUnlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and July, because of Qatar's intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity, the 2022 World Cup was played in November and December. As a result, the World Cup was unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of many domestic association football leagues, which started in late July or August, including all of the major European leagues, which had been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup. Major European competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.\nThe match schedule was confirmed by FIFA on 15 July 2020. The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day. Later, the schedule was tweaked by moving the Qatar vs Ecuador game to 20 November, after Qatar lobbied FIFA to allow their team to open the tournament. The final was played on 18 December 2022, National Day, at Lusail Stadium. Unlike previous tournaments where the match venues and kick-off times for each fixture were set prior to the draw, the assignment of group fixtures for each matchday to a specific venue and kick-off time was only made after the final draw, with the teams of each specific fixture known. This was due to the close proximity of the venues, which allowed the organizers to optimize stadium allocation for spectators and kick-off times for television audiences.\nThe matches for each group were allocated to the following stadiums:\nFIFA confirmed the group stage venue and kick-off times on 1 April 2022, following the draw.\nPrize money.\nIn April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations. Each qualified team received $1.5 million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each team receiving at least $9 million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool was $440 million, $40 million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.\nRule changes.\nThe tournament featured new substitution rules whereby teams could make up to five substitutions in normal time, and an additional substitution in extra time. In addition, it was the first World Cup to feature concussion substitutions, whereby each team was permitted to use a maximum of one concussion substitute during a match. A concussion substitution did not count towards a team's quota of regular substitutions. Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand suffered a concussion in his country's opening match against England and was replaced by Hossein Hosseini. This was the first use of a dedicated concussion substitute during a World Cup.\nHost selection.\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009. National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register interest. Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico withdrew from proceedings, and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the bid.\nAfter UEFA were guaranteed to host the 2018 event, members of UEFA were no longer in contention to host in 2022. There were five bids remaining for the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States.\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich, Switzerland, on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments. Two FIFA executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption regarding their votes. The decision to host the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which was graded as having \"high operational risk\", generated criticism from media commentators. It was criticised by many as being part of the FIFA corruption scandals, which led to the 2015 FIFA corruption case.\nThe voting patterns were as follows:\nCost of hosting the tournament.\nAt an estimated cost of over $220 billion, it is the most expensive World Cup ever held to date; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost was $8 billion, and other figures related to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.\nVenues.\nThe first five proposed venues for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. Qatar intended that the stadiums should reflect its history and culture, and for the designs to meet the following terms of reference: legacy, comfort, accessibility, and sustainability. The stadiums were equipped with cooling systems that aim to reduce temperatures within the stadium by up to .\nTheir marketing included statements describing the stadiums as zero waste, and the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure. Qatar aspired to be compliant and certified by the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) for all the World Cup stadiums. All of the five stadium projects launched were designed by German architect Albert Speer &amp; Partners. The Al Bayt and Al Wakrah stadiums were the only indoor stadiums of the eight used.\nIn an April 2013 report by Merrill Lynch, the organisers in Qatar requested that FIFA approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs. Bloomberg said that Qatar wished to cut the number of venues to eight or nine from the twelve originally planned. By April 2017, FIFA had yet to finalise the number of stadiums Qatar must have readied in five years' time. Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC) said it expected there would be eight in and near Doha, with the exception of Al Khor.\nEight stadiums in five Qatarian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Between 2010 (when Qatar were announced as hosts) and 2022, seven of the eight stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the Khalifa International Stadium was renovated for the tournament.\nOf these eight stadiums, all but one have since been either dismantled, or have been moderately or heavily modified. The Stadium 974 is no longer in use and is slated for dismantled after the tournament—this stadium was the first temporary stadium ever used for a FIFA World Cup. Lusail Stadium, Al Bayt Stadium, Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, Education City Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium and Al Janoub Stadium will been moderately or heavily modified as reduce their capacity by half. The Khalifa International Stadium is the only largely unmodified stadium that was used for this tournament.\nStadiums.\nTeam base camps \nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. In July 2022, FIFA announced the hotels and training sites for each participating team. This World Cup was the most compact since the inaugural edition in 1930, with 24 of the 32 teams being within a radius of each other, and are concentrated within the Doha area. It was the first Cup since 1930 in which players did not need to take flights to matches and could remain at the same training base throughout the entire tournament.\nSecurity.\nThe Qatari government employed about 50,000 security personnel including police departments and military forces from at least thirteen countries, including Poland, Germany, France, Kuwait, Jordan, Italy, Palestine, Spain, Pakistan, Turkey, USA, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. The Turkish government provided about 3,000 riot police personnel, whilst Pakistan provided about 4,500 Army troops to Qatar for the event.\nTeams.\nQualification.\nFIFA's six continental confederations organised their own qualifying competitions. All 211 FIFA member associations were eligible to enter qualification. The Qatari national team, as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament. However, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) obliged Qatar to participate in the Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also act as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. Since Qatar reached the final stage as winners in their group, Lebanon, the fifth-best second place team, advanced instead. France, the reigning World Cup champions, qualified for the event through European qualification.\nSaint Lucia initially entered CONCACAF qualification but withdrew from it before their first match. North Korea withdrew from the AFC qualifying round due to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both American Samoa and Samoa withdrew before the OFC qualification draw due to travel restrictions following the pandemic. Tonga withdrew after the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami. Due to COVID-19 outbreaks in their squads, Vanuatu and Cook Islands also withdrew because of the travel restrictions.\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 24 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2018. Qatar were the only team making their debut in the FIFA World Cup, becoming the first hosts to make their tournament debut since Italy in 1934. The Netherlands, Ecuador, Ghana, Cameroon, and the United States returned to the tournament after missing the 2018 tournament. Canada returned after 36 years, their only prior appearance being in 1986. Wales made their first appearance in 64 years—the longest-ever gap for any team, their only previous participation having been in 1958.\nItaly, four-time winners and reigning European champions, failed to qualify for a second successive World Cup for the first time in their history, losing in the qualification play-off semi-finals. The Italians were the only former champions and the highest ranked team in the FIFA Men's World Rankings that failed to qualify. Italy were also the fourth team to have failed to qualify for the upcoming World Cup after having won the previous UEFA European Championship, following Czechoslovakia in 1978, Denmark in 1994, and Greece in 2006. The previous World Cup hosts, Russia, were disqualified from competing due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nChile, the 2015 and 2016 Copa América winners, failed to qualify for the second consecutive time. Nigeria were defeated by Ghana on away goals in Confederation of African Football (CAF) final playoff round, having qualified for the previous three World Cups and six out of the last seven. Egypt, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Iceland, and Sweden, all of whom qualified for the 2018 World Cup, did not qualify for the 2022 tournament. Ghana were the lowest ranked team to qualify, ranked 61st.\nThe qualified teams, listed by region, with numbers in parentheses indicating final positions in the FIFA Men's World Ranking before the tournament were:\nAFC (6)\nCAF (5)\nCONCACAF (4)\nCONMEBOL (4)\nOFC (0)\nUEFA (13)\nSquads.\nBefore submitting their final squad for the tournament, teams named a provisional squad of up to 55 players. Teams were required to have their 55-player roster submitted to FIFA by 21 October. Teams were required to name their final squads by 13 November. In August 2022, FIFA increased the final squad size to 26 players from a total of 23 players at the 2018 edition. All teams had a total of 26 players in their final squads except for France and Iran, who chose 25 players.\nDraw.\nThe final draw was held at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center in Doha, Qatar, on 1 April 2022, 19:00 AST, prior to the completion of qualification. The two winners of the inter-confederation play-offs and the winner of the Path A of the UEFA play-offs were not known at the time of the draw. The draw was attended by 2,000 guests and was led by Carli Lloyd, Jermaine Jenas and sports broadcaster Samantha Johnson, assisted by the likes of Cafu (Brazil), Lothar Matthäus (Germany), Adel Ahmed Malalla (Qatar), Ali Daei (Iran), Bora Milutinović (Serbia/Mexico), Jay-Jay Okocha (Nigeria), Rabah Madjer (Algeria), and Tim Cahill (Australia).\nFor the draw, 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on the FIFA Men's World Rankings of 31 March 2022. Pot 1 contained host Qatar (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams. Pot 2 contained the next best eight teams, with the next best eight teams into pot 3. Pot 4 contained the five lowest-ranked teams, along with the placeholders for the two inter-confederation play-off winners and the UEFA Path A play-off winner. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group except for UEFA teams, for which there was at least one and no more than two per group.\nThis principle also applied to the placeholder teams, with constraints applying based on the confederation of both potential winners of each play-off tie. The draw started with pot 1 and ended with pot 4, with each team selected then allocated into the first available group alphabetically. The position for the team within the group would then be drawn (for the purpose of the match schedule), with the pot 1 teams automatically drawn into position 1 of each group. The pots for the draw are shown below.\nOfficiating.\nIn May 2022, FIFA announced the list of 36 referees, 69 assistant referees, and 24 video assistant referees for the tournament. Of the 36 referees, FIFA included two each from Argentina, Brazil, England, and France.\nFor the first time women referees officiated games at a major men's tournament. France's Stéphanie Frappart, Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda, and Yoshimi Yamashita from Japan became the first female referees to be appointed to a men's World Cup. Frappart previously oversaw the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. They were joined by three female assistant referees, Neuza Back, Kathryn Nesbitt, and Karen Díaz Medina. Frappart then officially became the first-ever female referee to officiate a World Cup match when she worked the Costa Rica vs Germany match in Group E on 1 December.\nGambian referee Bakary Gassama and Argentine assistant referee Juan Pablo Belatti were among the officials to serve at their third World Cup. Belatti was an assistant referee in the 2018 final. Other returning officials included referees César Arturo Ramos of Mexico and Janny Sikazwe of Zambia, and Iranian assistant referee Mohammadreza Mansouri.\nOn 15 December 2022, FIFA announced that Polish referee Szymon Marciniak would adjudicate the final.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony took place on Sunday, 20 November 2022 at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, prior to the opening match of the tournament between hosts Qatar and Ecuador. It included appearances by Morgan Freeman and Ghanim Al-Muftah, along with performances by South Korean singer and BTS member Jungkook and Qatari singer Fahad Al Kubaisi. It was the first time that the Qur'an had been recited as part of the opening ceremony. During the ceremony, Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani declared the tournament open.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stage was played from 20 November to 2 December. Competing countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, where the top two teams advanced to the knockout stage.\nGroup A.\nThe first match of the tournament was held between Qatar and Ecuador in Group A. Ecuador had a disallowed goal in the opening minutes, but eventually won 2–0 with two goals from Enner Valencia. Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at a World Cup. Many Qatar natives were seen leaving the game before the end, with ESPN reporting that two-thirds of the attendance had left. The other starting match in group A was won by the Netherlands 2–0 over Senegal. Cody Gakpo scored the opening goal in the 84th minute and Davy Klaassen added a second in stoppage time. Senegal faced Qatar in the third match of the group; Boulaye Dia capitalised on a slip by Boualem Khoukhi to put Senegal 1–0 ahead. Famara Diédhiou scored a second with a header, before Mohammed Muntari scored Qatar's first-ever goal at a World Cup to reduce the deficit back to one. Senegal eventually won the match 3–1 after an 84th-minute goal by Bamba Dieng. With this result, Qatar became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, as well as becoming the first host nation to ever be knocked out of the tournament after two games. Gakpo scored his second goal of the tournament as the Netherlands led Ecuador; however, Valencia scored an equaliser in the 49th minute. The Netherlands won 2–0 against Qatar following goals by Gakpo and Frenkie de Jong to win the group, while Qatar attained the distinction of being the first home nation to lose all three group matches. Senegal faced Ecuador to determine the second knockout round qualifier. At the end of the first half, Ismaïla Sarr scored a penalty kick to put Senegal ahead. In the 67th minute, Moisés Caicedo scored an equaliser, but shortly after, Kalidou Koulibaly gave Senegal the victory. The win was enough to qualify Senegal as the runners-up of Group A.\nGroup B.\nEngland completed a 6–2 victory over Iran. Iranian keeper Alireza Beiranvand was removed from the game for a suspected concussion before England scored three first-half goals. Mehdi Taremi scored in the second half after which England defender Harry Maguire was also removed for a concussion. Timothy Weah, of the United States, scored a first-half goal against Wales; however, the match finished as a draw after a penalty kick was won and scored by Gareth Bale. Iran defeated Wales 2–0 following a red card to Welsh goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey after he committed a foul outside of his penalty area. Substitute Rouzbeh Cheshmi scored the first goal eight minutes into stoppage time, followed by Ramin Rezaeian scoring three minutes later. England and the United States played to a 0–0 draw, with only four shots on target between them, and one shot from Christian Pulisic hit the crossbar. England won the group following a 3–0 win over Wales with a goal by Phil Foden and two by Marcus Rashford. Christian Pulisic scored the winning goal as the United States defeated Iran 1–0 to qualify for the round of 16.\nGroup C.\nArgentina took an early lead against Saudi Arabia after Lionel Messi scored a penalty kick after ten minutes; however, second-half goals by Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari won the match 2–1 for Saudi Arabia, a result the media considered one of the biggest upsets in the history of the event. The match between Mexico and Poland ended as a goalless 0–0 draw after Guillermo Ochoa saved Robert Lewandowski's penalty kick attempt. Lewandowski scored his first career World Cup goal in a 2–0 win over Saudi Arabia four days later. Argentina defeated Mexico 2–0, with Messi scoring the opener and later assisting teammate Enzo Fernández who scored his first international goal. Argentina won their last game against Poland with goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julián Álvarez, which was enough to win the group; Poland qualified for the knockout stage on goal difference, thanks to Saudi Arabia scoring an injury-time consolation goal against Mexico in a match already lost.\nGroup D.\nThe match between Denmark and Tunisia ended as a goalless draw; both teams had goals disallowed by offside calls. Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen made his first major international appearance since suffering a cardiac arrest at the UEFA Euro 2020. Defending champions France went a goal behind to Australia, after a Craig Goodwin goal within ten minutes. France, however, scored four goals, by Adrien Rabiot, Kylian Mbappé and two by Olivier Giroud to win 4–1. The goals tied Giroud with Thierry Henry as France's all-time top goalscorer. Mitchell Duke scored the only goal as Australia won against Tunisia. This was their first World Cup win since 2010. Mbappé scored a brace as France defeated Denmark 2–1. This was enough for France to qualify for the knockout round—the first time since Brazil in 2006 that the defending champions progressed through the opening round. Mathew Leckie scored the only goal as Australia defeated Denmark 1–0, qualifying for the knockout round as runners-up with the win. Wahbi Khazri scored for Tunisia against France in the 58th minute. Although Antoine Griezmann equalised in stoppage time it was overturned for offside. Tunisia finished third in the group, as they required a draw in the Denmark and Australia game.\nGroup E.\nGroup E began with Japan facing 2014 champions Germany. After an early penalty kick was converted by Germany's İlkay Gündoğan, Japan scored two second-half goals by Ritsu Dōan and Takuma Asano in a 2–1 win. In the second group match, Spain defeated Costa Rica 7–0. First-half goals by Dani Olmo, Marco Asensio, and Ferran Torres were followed by goals by Gavi, Carlos Soler, Alvaro Morata, and a second by Torres. This was the largest defeat in a World Cup since Portugal's victory over North Korea in the 2010 event by the same scoreline. Costa Rica defeated Japan 1–0, with Keysher Fuller scoring with Costa Rica's first shot on target of the tournament. Germany and Spain drew 1–1, with Álvaro Morata scoring for Spain and Niclas Füllkrug scoring for Germany. Morata scored the opening goal for Spain against Japan as they controlled the first half of the match. Japan equalised on Ritsu Doan before a second goal by Ao Tanaka was heavily investigated by VAR for the ball potentially being out of play. The goal was awarded, and Japan won the group following a 2–1 win. Serge Gnabry scored on ten minutes for Germany against Costa Rica and they led until half-time. Germany required a win, and for Japan to not win their match, or for both teams to win their matches by a combined goal difference of at least 9 goals, to qualify. In the second half, goals by Yeltsin Tejeda and Juan Vargas gave Costa Rica a 2–1 lead, which would have qualified them into the knockout stages ahead of Spain. Germany scored three further goals—two by Kai Havertz and a goal by Niclas Fullkrug, ending in a 4–2 win for Germany—which was not enough to qualify them for the final stages. This was the second time in a row that the four-time champions failed to progress past the group stages. Japan won the group ahead of Spain.\nGroup F.\nGroup F's first match was a goalless draw between Morocco and Croatia. Canada had a penalty kick in the first half of their match against Belgium which was saved by Thibaut Courtois. Belgium won the match by a single goal by Michy Batshuayi. Belgium lost 2–0 to Morocco, despite Morocco having a long-range direct free kick goal by Hakim Ziyech overturned for an offside on another player in the lead up to the goal. Two second-half goals from Zakaria Aboukhlal and Romain Saïss helped the Morocco win their first World Cup match since 1998. The match sparked riots in Belgium, with fires and fireworks being set off by residents. Alphonso Davies scored Canada's first World Cup goal to give Canada the lead over Croatia. Goals by Marko Livaja, Lovro Majer, and two by Andrej Kramarić for Croatia completed a 4–1 victory. Morocco scored two early goals through Hakim Ziyech and Youssef En-Nesyri in their game against Canada and qualified following a 2–1 victory. Canada's only goal was an own goal by Nayef Aguerd. Croatia and Belgium played a goalless draw which eliminated Belgium, whose team was ranked second in the world, from the tournament.\nGroup G.\nBreel Embolo scored the only goal in Switzerland's 1–0 defeat of Cameroon. Richarlison scored two goals as Brazil won against Serbia, with star player Neymar receiving an ankle injury. Cameroon's Jean-Charles Castelletto scored the opening goal against Serbia, but they were quickly behind as Serbia scored three goals by Strahinja Pavlović, Sergej Milinković-Savić, and Aleksandar Mitrović either side of half time. Cameroon, however, scored goals through Vincent Aboubakar and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, completing a 3–3 draw. An 83rd-minute winner by Casemiro for Brazil over Switzerland was enough for them to qualify for the knockout stage. Having already qualified, Brazil were unable to win their final group game, as they were defeated by Cameroon 1–0 following a goal by Vincent Aboubakar. Already having a yellow card, he was later sent off for removing his shirt in celebrating the goal. Cameroon, however, did not qualify, as Switzerland defeated Serbia 3–2.\nGroup H.\nUruguay and South Korea played to a goalless draw. A goalless first half between Portugal and Ghana preceded a penalty converted by Cristiano Ronaldo to give Portugal the lead. In scoring the goal, Ronaldo became the first man to score in five World Cups. Ghana responded with a goal by André Ayew before goals by João Félix, and Rafael Leão by Portugal put them 3–1 ahead. Osman Bukari scored in the 89th minute to trail by a single goal, while Iñaki Williams had a chance to equalise for Ghana ten minutes into stoppage time, but slipped before shooting. The match finished 3–2 to Portugal. Ghanaian Mohammed Salisu opened the scoring against South Korea, with Mohammed Kudus following it up. In the second half, Cho Gue-sung scored a brace for South Korea, levelling the score. Mohammed Kudus scored again in the 68th minute, winning the match 3–2 for Ghana. Portugal defeated Uruguay 2–0 with two goals from Bruno Fernandes, advancing them to the knockout stage. A controversial penalty decision was called late in the game, with a suspected handball from José María Giménez. Portugal led South Korea through Ricardo Horta after 10 minutes. However, goals by Kim Young-gwon and Hwang Hee-chan won the match 2–1 for South Korea. Giorgian de Arrascaeta scored two goals as Uruguay defeated Ghana 2–0. However, with South Korea winning, Uruguay required another goal to progress as they finished third on goals scored. Several Uruguay players left the pitch after the game surrounding the referees and followed them off the pitch.\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if the scores were equal when normal playing time expired, extra time was played for two periods of 15 minutes each. This was followed, if required, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.\nRound of 16.\nThe round of 16 was played from 3 to 7 December, which for the first time ever included teams from the Americas and four other continents. Group A winners Netherlands scored goals through Memphis Depay, Daley Blind, and Denzel Dumfries as they defeated the United States 3–1, with Haji Wright scoring for the United States. Messi scored his third of the tournament alongside Julián Álvarez to give Argentina a two-goal lead over Australia, and despite an Enzo Fernández own goal from a Craig Goodwin shot, Argentina won 2–1. Olivier Giroud's goal and Mbappé's brace enabled France to have a 3–1 victory over Poland, with Robert Lewandowski scoring the lone goal for Poland from a penalty. England beat Senegal 3–0, with goals coming from Jordan Henderson, Harry Kane, and Bukayo Saka. Daizen Maeda scored for Japan against Croatia in the first half before a leveller from Ivan Perišić in the second. Neither team could find the winner, with Croatia defeating Japan 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out. Vinícius Júnior, Neymar, Richarlison, and Lucas Paquetá all scored for Brazil, but a volley from South Korean Paik Seung-ho reduced the deficit to 4–1. Pablo Sarabia had the best chance for Spain to break the deadlock against Morocco in stoppage time after two goalless hours, but he hit the goalie's right-hand post after a shot from the left; Morocco won the match 3–0 on penalties. A hat-trick by Gonçalo Ramos led Portugal to defeat Switzerland 6–1, with goals from Portugal's Pepe, Raphaël Guerreiro, and Rafael Leão and from Switzerland's Manuel Akanji.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 9 and 10 December. Croatia and Brazil ended 0–0 after 90 minutes and went to extra time. Neymar scored for Brazil in the 15th minute of extra time. Croatia, however, equalised through Bruno Petković in the second period of extra time. With the match tied, a penalty shootout decided the contest, with Croatia winning the shootout 4–2. In the second quarter-final match, Nahuel Molina and Messi scored for Argentina before Wout Weghorst equalised with two goals shortly before the end of the game. The match went to extra time and then penalties, where Argentina would go on to win 4–3. Morocco defeated Portugal 1–0, with Youssef En-Nesyri scoring at the end of the first half. Morocco became the first African and the first Arab nation to advance as far as the semi-finals of the competition. Despite Harry Kane scoring a penalty for England, it was not enough to beat France, who won 2–1 by virtue of goals from Aurélien Tchouaméni and Olivier Giroud and a late missed penalty by Kane, sending them to their second consecutive World Cup semi-final and becoming the first defending champions to reach this stage since Brazil in 1998.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 13 and 14 December. Messi scored a penalty kick before Julián Álvarez scored twice to give Argentina a 3–0 victory over Croatia. Théo Hernandez scored after five minutes as France led Morocco for most of the game. Randal Kolo Muani scored in the 78th minute to complete a 2–0 victory for France over Morocco as they reached their second consecutive final.\nThird place play-off.\nThe third place play-off was played on 17 December. The two teams had played against each other in their opening game in Group F which finished 0–0. Joško Gvardiol promptly scored for Croatia, with Achraf Dari equalising just 2 minutes later. Mislav Oršić scored the winner for Croatia as the match finished 2–1. Morocco earned 4th place, a record for the team and the best World Cup finish of any African or Arab nation.\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 18 December between Argentina and France. Both teams had won the event twice previously. Early goals from Lionel Messi and Ángel Di María gave Argentina, leading 2–0, a head start against the French. Despite substitutions in the first half, France did not record a shot until after the 70th minute but were energised by additional substitutions in the 71st. A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicolás Otamendi. Mbappé scored the penalty and added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores. With the score tied at two goals apiece, the match went to extra time. Messi scored his second goal in the 108th minute, once again giving Argentina the lead. However, Mbappé was awarded a second penalty in the 115th minute after his shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé scored his third goal, becoming the second player ever to complete a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup after Geoff Hurst for England in 1966. With the score tied at 3–3, the match was determined via a penalty shootout. Argentina won the final after scoring all of their penalties, winning 4–2. This marked their third World Cup win and their first since 1986.\nStatistics.\nGoalscorers.\n&lt;section begin=Goalscorers/&gt;&lt;section end=Goalscorers/&gt;\nDiscipline.\nA player or team official is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\nAwards.\nThe following World Cup awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament: the Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper).\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 10 goals for users to vote on as the tournament's best. The award was won by Brazil's Richarlison for his second goal in the group stage match against Serbia.\nMarketing.\nBranding.\nThe official emblem was designed by Unlock Brands and unveiled in September 2019, during simultaneous events at the Doha Tower, Katara Cultural Village amphitheatre, Msheireb Downtown Doha, and Zubarah. It is based on a shawl (reflecting upon the tournament's late-Autumn scheduling) and desert dunes, and was shaped to resemble the tournament trophy, the infinity symbol, and the number \"8\"—reflecting upon the \"interconnected\" event and the eight host stadiums. The typography of the emblem's wordmark incorporated kashida—the practice of elongating certain parts of characters in Arabic script to provide typographical emphasis.\nH.E Ambassador Dr. Hend Al-Muftah, Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the United Nations Office at Geneva, explained to WIPO Magazine that the tournament provided an opportunity to \"promote our culture and showcase our signature hospitality in a multicultural environment\", and highlighted that the country has used sports to demonstrate its \"commitment to sustainable development, social inclusion and the values of community and mutual respect among peoples from different cultures and nations.\"\nMerchandise.\nElectronic Arts' licensed video games \"FIFA Mobile\" and \"FIFA 23\" (except on Nintendo Switch) received free updates with tie-in content for the 2022 World Cup on 8 and 9 November 2022, respectively. The update for \"FIFA 23\" added World Cup-themed tournament modes with all teams and two of the stadiums from the event, campaigns and World Cup-themed unlockable content for Ultimate Team mode, and real-time squad and fixture updates during the tournament.\nOn 24 August 2022, the Panini Group produced themed stickers and a sticker album for a 14th consecutive World Cup. This year, rare cards with coloured borders were included and could be collected, traded, or sold.\nOn 12 April 2022, FIFA released an over-the-top media service and app revolving around the World Cup called FIFA+, where fans could play games, predict matches, and compete with others.\nBroadcasting rights.\nIn May 2022, Infantino projected that the 2022 FIFA World Cup could be the most-watched in its history, with a global audience of at least 5 billion. The 2018 tournament was seen by 3.57 billion across the tournament. The various controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar led to questions over how the tournament would be covered in the media, and whether they would be discussed or addressed during coverage. The match between England and the United States in the group stage was seen by approximately 20 million viewers across both Fox and Telemundo, ranking among the highest-rated associated football broadcasts in the United States (behind a 2014 World Cup match that drew 24.7 million).\nSymbols.\nMascot.\nThe tournament's official mascot was unveiled on 1 April 2022, during the group stage draw. Its name is Laeeb (), which is an Arabic word meaning \"super-skilled player\". The official website of FIFA says: \"Laeeb will be known for his youthful spirit; spreading joy and confidence everywhere he goes\", and the official backstory of the character, published there, claims that it comes from a parallel world where tournament mascots live, \"a world where ideas and creativity form the basis of characters that live in the minds of everyone\".\nMatch ball.\nThe official match ball, \"Al Rihla\", was unveiled on 30 March 2022. It was mainly inspired by the culture, architecture, iconic boats and flag of Qatar. In Arabic, the word \"Al-Rihla\" ( ) means \"the journey\". The ball was designed with sustainability as a priority, making it the first-ever official match ball created with water-based glues and inks. As \"the game is getting faster\" and \"speeds up\", the Adidas ball has internal electronic sensors, allowing detection of its speed and position, updated 500 times per second and it has to be charged before each game. Two of the match balls were sent and returned from space by FIFA and Qatar Airways on a SpaceX falcon 9 suborbital mission for promoting the World Cup.\nThe match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final was announced on 11 December 2022. It is a variation of the Al Rihla named the \"Adidas Al Hilm\" (, a reference to \"every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup\"). Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a \"Gold Metallic\", maroon, \"Collegiate Burgundy\", and red design, a reference to the national colors of host nation Qatar and the golden colors shared by the Final's venue and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.\nMusic.\nFor the first time, a multi-song FIFA World Cup official soundtrack has been released, instead of one official song. The first song of the album is \"Hayya Hayya (Better Together)\", performed by Trinidad Cardona, Davido, and AISHA, released on 1 April 2022 along with the music video. The second song is \"Arhbo\", performed by Gims and Ozuna, released on 19 August 2022 along with the music video. The third song is \"The World Is Yours to Take\" performed by American rapper Lil Baby, released on 23 September 2022 along with a music video. The fourth song is \"Light The Sky\" performed by Nora Fatehi, Manal, Rahma Riad, and Balqees, composed by RedOne and released on 7 October 2022 along with the music video.\nA fifth song, \"Tukoh Taka\", performed by Nicki Minaj, Maluma and Myriam Fares, was released on 17 November 2022 along with the music video, serving as the official song of the FIFA Fan Festival. The final song is \"Dreamers\" by Jungkook of BTS released on 20 November 2022. It was performed with Fahad Al-Kubaisi during the tournament's opening ceremony.\nControversies.\nCriticism of the 2022 FIFA World Cup focused on Qatar's human-rights record, namely their treatment of migrant workers, women, and position on LGBT rights, leading to allegations of sportswashing. Others cited Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption. Boycotts of the event were declared by several countries, clubs, and individual players, with former FIFA president Sepp Blatter twice stating that giving Qatar hosting rights was a \"mistake\". The FIFA World Cup delivered record-breaking numbers of TV audiences across multiple markets. In June 2023, \"Le Point\" revealed that FIFA World Cup has raised great interest in the country despite \"calls for a boycott\". According to the study by \"Arcom\", six out of ten French people followed at least one match.\nHost selection criticism.\nThere have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection process involving FIFA's executive committee members. These allegations are being investigated by FIFA . In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup 2022 being held in Qatar. The accusations of corruption were made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA internal investigation and report cleared Qatar of any violation, but chief investigator Michael J. Garcia described FIFA's report on his enquiry as containing \"numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations.\"\nIn May 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors opened an investigation into corruption and money laundering related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids. In August 2018, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed that Qatar had used \"black ops\", suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the hosting rights. Some investigations found that Qatar sought an edge in securing hosting by hiring a former CIA officer turned private contractor, Kevin Chalker, to spy on rival bid teams and key football officials who picked the winner in 2010.\nIn September 2018, a delegation from al-Ghufran tribe lodged a complaint to FIFA's president to reject the establishment of the World Cup in Qatar unless its government restored the Qatari nationality to all those affected from the tribe and returned land allegedly stolen from them to build the sport facilities.\nQatar faced strong criticism for the treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the World Cup, with Amnesty International referring to \"forced labour\" and poor working conditions, while many migrant workers reported having to pay large \"recruitment fees\" to obtain employment. \"The Guardian\" newspaper reported that many workers were denied food and water, had their identity papers taken away from them, and that they were not paid on time or at all, making some of them in effect slaves. \"The Guardian\" estimated that up to 4,000 workers could die from lax safety and other causes by the time the competition was held. Between 2015 and 2021, the Qatari government adopted new labour reforms to improve working conditions, including a minimum wage for all workers and the removal of the kafala system. Furthermore, in November 2017, the International Labour Organization concluded that no rights were violated and made the decision to close the complaint against Qatar regarding the alleged violation of migrant workers' rights. According to Amnesty International, however, living and working conditions of the foreign workers did not improve in the last years.\nQatar was the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup – the next smallest by area was Switzerland, host of the 1954 World Cup, which was more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of 32. Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of the first two World Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting rights of the 2002 World Cup in 1996 without ever having qualified for the finals, although they qualified for the 1998 edition. Of the eight stadiums used in the tournament, six were located in the Doha metropolitan area, making it the first World Cup since 1930 in which most of the stadiums were in one city. While this decreased the distance that fans and players needed to commute, Qatar itself struggled to accommodate the numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space.\nDue to Qatar's laws on alcohol consumption, World Cup organisers announced the creation of designated \"sobering-up\" zones as an alternative to wide-scale arrests of intoxicated fans during the World Cup. Qatar's World Cup chief executive of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, Nasser Al Khater, stated that the purpose of the designated sobering-up areas was to ensure the fans' safety. If a fan was sent to the \"sobering up\" zone, they were permitted to leave when they could display clearheaded behaviour. Multiple news agencies described the controversy as a \"cultural clash\" between social conservatism and Islamic morality against the \"norms\" of secular Western liberal democracies.\nA number of groups and media outlets expressed concern over the suitability of Qatar to host the event. Issues regarding from human rights, worker conditions, the rights of LGBT fans, and the illegality of homosexuality in Qatar. In December 2020, Qatar said rainbow flags would be allowed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Qatari officials initially stated that they would not prohibit the display of pride flags at tournament venues, although the country still advised LGBT attendees to comply with the country's modesty and avoid public displays of affection. Hassan Abdulla al-Thawadi, chief executive of the country's World Cup bid, said that Qatar would permit alcohol consumption during the event, even though drinking in public was not permitted. There were plans to allow the sale of alcohol inside stadiums and at fan villages. Normally, the sale of alcohol is restricted to non-Muslim guests at selected luxury hotels only. However, in the months preceding the tournament, the display of LGBT material and the sale of alcohol were banned.\nThe climate conditions caused some to call hosting the tournament in Qatar infeasible, with initial plans for air-conditioned stadiums giving way to a potential date switch from summer to November and December. In May 2014, Sepp Blatter, who was FIFA president at the time of the selection, remarked that awarding the World Cup to Qatar was a \"mistake\" because of the extreme heat. While addressing delegates from African and Asian confederations, Blatter said allegations of corruption and some of the criticism, including those from sponsors, were \"very much linked to racism and discrimination\". The attendance figures at the matches also came under scrutiny as the reported crowd attendance was more than the stadium capacities despite games having visible empty seats.\nPrior to the tournament, a reporter for Denmark's TV 2 was threatened by security during a live report from the Katara Cultural Village; the organising committee apologised, stating that they were \"mistakenly interrupted\". Tony O'Donoghue of Ireland's RTÉ also accused Qatari police of interrupting him while filming.\nOn 5 November 2022, \"The Sunday Times\" and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism published an investigation reporting that a group from an Indian hacking company had compromised the email accounts of various politicians, reporters, and other prominent individuals that had been critical of Qatar's hosting of the World Cup. It was also reported that the group had been hired by Jonas Rey, private investigators based in Switzerland, which were in turn hired by Qatari officials.\nMigrant workers.\nThere was criticism regarding the state of human rights in Qatar and of the conditions of migrant workers brought in to build the required infrastructure, including indentured servitude and working conditions leading to deaths. On 23 October 2022, an article published by \"The Guardian\" included statements from migrants working on the event infrastructure. Surveying 1,000 workers, 86% of participants said that the labour changes had improved their lives and that better working conditions are negotiable. Legislation has also been proposed on the minimum wage, summertime worker safety, and the election of migrant worker representatives in businesses. Labour mobility is a result of changes to the Kafala system.\nAccording to Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, prior to the tournament, \"the new Kafala system tranche of law will put an end to Kafala and establish a contemporary industrial relations system.\"\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended Qatar's decision to host the tournament. Others have asserted that Qatar has a better human rights record than Russia and China, which were subjected to less harsh criticism for the same problems when hosting important athletic events in the years before the tournament.\nMove to November and December.\nOwing to the climate in Qatar, concerns were expressed over holding the World Cup in its traditional time frame of June and July. In October 2013, a task force was commissioned to consider alternative dates and report after the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022, to avoid the summer heat and also avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, the 2022 Winter Paralympics in March and Ramadan in April.\nThe notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world. Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be. FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the event to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".\nFrank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA. Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme. In 2015, FIFA confirmed that the final would be played in December. Critics condemned the Euro-centrism of these allegations, and questioned why global sporting events must be held within the traditional European summer season.\nBidding corruption allegations, 2014.\nSome allegations were made over the role of former football official Mohammed bin Hammam played in securing the bid. A former employee of the Qatar bid team alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5 million by Qatar. She retracted her claims, but later said that she was coerced to do so by Qatari bid officials. In March 2014, it was discovered that former CONCACAF president Jack Warner and his family were paid almost $2 million from a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign.\n\"The Sunday Times\" published bribery allegations based on a leak of millions of secret documents. Five of FIFA's six primary sponsors, Sony, Adidas, Visa, Hyundai, and Coca-Cola, called upon FIFA to investigate the claims. Jim Boyce, vice-president of FIFA, stated he would support a re-vote to find a new host if the corruption allegations are proven. FIFA completed a lengthy investigation into these allegations and a report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing. Despite the claims, the Qataris insisted that the corruption allegations were being driven by envy and mistrust while Blatter said it was fueled by racism in the British media.\nIn the 2015 FIFA corruption case, Swiss officials, operating under information from the United States Department of Justice, arrested many senior FIFA officials in Zürich and seized physical and electronic records from FIFA's main headquarters. The arrests continued in the United States, where several FIFA officers were arrested, and FIFA buildings were raided. The arrests were made on the information of at least a $150 million corruption and bribery scandal. From those arrested, $40 million was forfeited under guilty pleas. In 2022, the president of the El Salvador soccer association, Reynaldo Vasquez, was sentenced to 16 months in prison in connection to over $350,000 in bribes.\nFollowing the corruption case, Phaedra Almajid, the former media officer for the Qatar bid team, claimed that the allegations would result in Qatar not hosting the World Cup. In an interview published on the same day, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled.\"\nIn 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids. At the end of the investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report. The FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge, Hans Joachim Eckert, who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations, stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process. Michael Garcia reacted almost immediately, stating that the report is \"materially incomplete\" and contains \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\".\nIn 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg claimed to have obtained the report and wrote that it \"does not provide proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought\" and stated that he would publish the full report. This forced FIFA to release the original report. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of the 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested the rules of conduct to the limit.\nRussian participation.\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) handed Russia a four-year ban from all major sporting events, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated lab data to investigators. The Russian national team were still permitted to enter qualification, as the ban only applied to the final tournament to decide the world champions. A team representing Russia, which used the Russian flag and anthem, could not participate under the WADA decision whilst the ban was active. The decision was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and on 17 December 2020, Russian teams were banned from competing at world championships organized or sanctioned by a WADA signatory until 16 December 2022, the day before the third place play-off.\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia's participation was further thrown into doubt. On 24 February 2022, the three teams in Russia's qualifying path—Czech Republic, Poland, and Sweden—announced their unwillingness to play any matches in Russian territory. Poland and Sweden extended the boycott on 26 February to any qualifying games, and the Czech Republic made the same decision one day later.\nOn 27 February 2022, FIFA announced a number of sanctions impacting Russia's participation in international football. Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team was ordered to play all home matches behind closed doors in neutral countries. Under these sanctions, Russia would not be allowed to compete under the country's name, flag, or national anthem; similarly to the Russian athletes' participation in events such as the Olympics, the team would compete under the abbreviation of their national federation, the Russian Football Union (\"RFU\"), rather than \"Russia\". The next day, FIFA decided to suspend Russia from international competitions \"until further notice\", including its participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nLGBT and women's rights.\nThere are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights criminalized. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with the security of fans, as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion. The main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue wearing rainbow-colored armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination. Typically, kit violations incur a fine, which the teams had said they would pay; on the day of the first match involving one of the teams, FIFA reportedly told the teams that they would receive a yellow card at a minimum for wearing the armbands. Qatari officials stated that all people are welcome as long as they follow the public display of affection laws which apply to everyone.\nSecurity officials at stadiums also confiscated items of rainbow clothing and flags featuring rainbows. American journalist Grant Wahl was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it. Wahl reportedly received death threats for wearing the shirt, later dying at the stadium. Other journalists with Wahl at the time of his death have reported that he began fitting or experiencing a seizure, and called for help himself. They criticized the Qatar Supreme Committee for not providing defibrillators in the stadium, as they had looked for one to try to help Wahl. In response, FIFA said that according to the ambulance service, a defibrillator was made available when paramedics later arrived on scene. An autopsy done on Wahl in New York City later revealed that Wahl died from an aortic aneurysm rupture.\nDiscrimination against women in Qatar was also criticized. Women in Qatar have few freedoms, as they must obtain permission from their male guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many government jobs, travel abroad, receive certain forms of reproductive health care, and act as the primary guardian of children, even if they are divorced.\nQatar attracted particular criticism for an incident where a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee was accused of allegedly having sex outside of marriage. The woman had previously reported rape, while the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of flagellation and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case was eventually dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar.\nInfluence of Iran.\nIn November 2022, there were reports suggesting that the government of Iran were working with Qatari officials to suppress anti-government protests at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, in light of the Mahsa Amini protests. Leaked documents and audio clips suggested that Iranian government officials were in correspondence with Qatari authorities in order to handle possible protesters.\nIn November 2022, the Qatari government revoked the visas of journalists from a London-based Iranian news channel, Iran International, known for being critical of the regime, who were seeking to cover the World Cup. On 21 November 2022, during the first group stage match from Group B, between Iran and England, attempts were reportedly made by the stadium's security forces to block Iranian fans who wore clothing or carried items bearing slogans that were deemed unsympathetic to the Islamic government of Iran. These included t-shirts and signs with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" embedded onto them, Iran's previous flags, or any slogans containing the name of Mahsa Amini. This crackdown continued throughout all of Iran's matches at the World Cup. In addition to removing fans from stadiums, reports showed that officials tried to suppress any filming or photography of possible protests. In one case, Qatari police detained Danish TV presenter, Rasmus Tantholdt, for filming fans with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" slogans, some of whom who had been earlier abused by a group of pro-government supporters.\nTreatment of Jewish and Israeli visitors.\nQatar had previously promised to provide Jewish tourists with cooked \"kosher\" food and public Jewish prayer services at the tournament. However, shortly before the World Cup began, both were banned by Qatar, who claimed it could not secure the safety of Jews. Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.\nWhilst Jewish organisations complained of being unable to find cooked kosher food, the Israeli government said it was happy with the efforts made by Qatar to meet its requests, including kosher food, direct flights from Israel to Qatar, and temporary diplomatic representation in the country. A kosher kitchen under the supervision of Rabbi Mendy Chitrik was open in time for the first match. Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, said he had never asked the Qatari government for cooked food, and he had been the only person in communication with the Qataris regarding making the World Cup experience inclusive for Jews.\nMultiple Israeli reporters at the tournament reported fans from Arab nations waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans while harassing them. Some Israelis reported that they had been escorted out of restaurants when their nationality was revealed. The Israeli government warned its citizens traveling to the tournament to hide their Israeli identity out of safety concerns.\nAccommodation.\nThe Rawdat Al Jahhaniya fan village was criticised for its overpriced \"night cabins\" (£185 per night) made out of shipping containers. Tourists complained that the air conditioners in the cabins did not function well, facilities were falling apart, and the sleeping experience did not match their expectations. The BBC reported that the tent accommodation at the Qetaifan Island fan village got criticism for having brown-colored tap water and no air conditioning other than a standing fan. The tent village in Al Khor was criticized for having inconvenient transportation, a lack of alcohol, long waits to check in, and no locks on the tents. The lack of suitable and affordable accommodation raised demand for daily shuttle flights from neighboring areas, such as Dubai, that had adequate numbers of hotel rooms."

        "text": "The 2010 FIFA Club World Cup (officially known as the FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2010 presented by Toyota for sponsorship reasons) was a football tournament that was played from 8 to 18 December 2010. It was the seventh FIFA Club World Cup and was hosted by the United Arab Emirates.\nDefending champions Barcelona did not qualify as they were eliminated in the semi-finals of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League by eventual champions Internazionale. African representatives TP Mazembe of DR Congo defeated South America's Internacional of Brazil in the semi-finals to become the first team from outside Europe or South America to reach a Club World Cup final. However, Mazembe were unable to pass the final hurdle, as they lost 3–0 to Internazionale in the final.

Hubert Green won his second major title, two strokes ahead of defending champion Lee Trevino. It was Green's 19th and final victory on the PGA Tour.\nTrevino led after 36 holes at 134 (−8), but a 75 (+4) on Saturday allowed Green to take the lead at 206 (−7), three strokes ahead. An eagle on Sunday at the fifth hole gave the 45-year-old Trevino a one stroke lead, but four three-putts produced an even-par round with six bogeys. The two were tied as late as the 15th tee; Green continued making pars, while Trevino bogeyed 15 and 17. Trevino admitted that the $50 heavy putter which helped him win in 1984 on wetter, softer greens in Alabama hurt him on the drier, faster greens in Colorado, especially on Sunday.\nThis was the fifth major championship at Cherry Hills, which hosted the PGA Championship in 1941 and the U.S. Open in 1938, 1960, and 1978.

        "title": "California Golden Bears men's basketball",
        "text": "The California Golden Bears men's basketball team is the college basketball team of the University of California, Berkeley. The program has seen success throughout the years, culminating in a national championship in 1959 under coach Pete Newell, and the team has reached the final four two other times, in 1946 and 1960.\nThe team plays its home games at Haas Pavilion, which was long known as Harmon Gym before being heavily renovated with money donated in part by the owners of Levi Strauss &amp; Co. The arena was originally known as Men's Gymnasium and then later Harmon Gymnasium until the late 1990s when it went through renovations which displaced the team for two seasons.\nHistory.\nThe Golden Bears first played basketball intercollegiately in 1907 and began full conference play in 1915. The 1920s was the dominant decade for Cal basketball, as the Bears won 6 conference titles under coaches E.H. Wright and Nibs Price. Cal was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion for the 1926–27 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\nNibs Price coached Cal with great success for 30 years from 1924 to 1954, earning a 449–294 total record, many single season winning records, and an additional 3 conference titles in the 1930s and 1940s.\nCal reached the pinnacle of the sport during the tenure of Pete Newell, who was head coach from 1955 to 1960. The Golden Bears earned the conference title four out of his five years and in 1959, won the NCAA title. In Newell's last year, Cal came close to another NCAA title, but lost to Ohio State in the final.\nThe fortunes of Cal men's basketball would never be the same after Newell. The next quarter-century was mostly a dreary one for the program, despite having players such as Butch Hays (1981–1984) and Kevin Johnson (1983–1987) who both set school records for assists. From 1960 to 1985, the Bears tallied only two winning seasons in conference play. Lou Campanelli served as head coach from 1986 to 1993. The highlight of this era was a 75–67 victory over UCLA in 1986 that ended a 25-year, 52 game losing streak to the Bruins. Campanelli in his first season took the Golden Bears to the 1986 National Invitation Tournament, the first post season appearance of any sort since 1960. In 1990, Campanelli led the Golden Bears to their first NCAA Tournament in 30 years.\nCal achieved much better success in the 1990s, qualifying for the NCAA tournament five times with future NBA players Jason Kidd (the Golden Bears all-time assists leader) and Lamond Murray, as well as future perennial All-Pro NFL tight end Tony Gonzalez in the early and mid 1990s and Sean Lampley and Shareef Abdur-Rahim in the late 1990s. Cal also won the 1999 National Invitation Tournament, with a thrilling 61–60 victory over Clemson in the title game.\nThis success came amid a brief period of turmoil in the mid-1990s. Campanelli was fired midway through the 1992–93 season after athletic director Bob Bockrath heard Campanelli berate his players with obscenity-laden tirades following two losses. Assistant Todd Bozeman finished out the season, and was named permanent head coach after leading the Bears to an upset of two-time defending champion Duke in the NCAA Tournament. Bozeman himself was pushed out two months before the 1996–97 season after it emerged that he'd funneled $30,000 over two years to the parents of star recruit Jelani Gardner so they could make the drive to see their son play. Ultimately, the Bears were docked four scholarships over two years and forfeited the entire 1994–95 season and all but one game of the 1995–96 season.\nBen Braun took over for Bozeman just before the 1996–97 season. Inheriting a team expected to be barely competitive in the Pac-10, Braun led the Bears to a second-place finish and took them all the way to the Sweet 16. During Braun's 12-year tenure, Cal qualified for the NCAA tournament three straight times in the 2000s and six times overall. However, after finishing near the bottom of the Pac-10 for the second straight year, Braun was dismissed in late March 2008. The former coach of rival Stanford, Mike Montgomery, succeeded Braun. In his first year the Bears finished tied for third in the Pac-10 and made it to the NCAA tournament, where they were eliminated in the first round to the Maryland Terrapins.\nIn 2006, the Golden Bears reached their first Pacific Life Pac-10 Men's Basketball Tournament championship game. Power forward Leon Powe grabbed a tournament-record 20 rebounds against USC in the first round and then scored a tournament-record 41 points in a double-overtime victory versus Oregon in the semi-finals. Despite California's 71–52 loss to UCLA in the final game, Powe was named Most Valuable Player for the tournament.\nIn Montgomery's second season, the Bears won their first conference title in 50 years. The team, featuring four seniors as starters, only lost one game at Haas Pavilion but had a rough non-conference schedule featuring losses to elite teams such as Kansas, Ohio State, and Syracuse, which quickly knocked them out of the national rankings after being ranked #13 in the pre-season. Despite losing the Pac-10 tournament, and questions on whether even the conference champion of a down Pac-10 conference would receive an at-large bid to the tournament, the Bears qualified for their second straight NCAA bid as a #8 seed. They one-upped their previous season by winning their first round matchup against the Louisville Cardinals but fell to the eventual national champions, Duke, in the second round. Senior Jerome Randle finished the season and his career as Cal's all-time leading scorer. The highlight of Montgomery's last season as the head coach for Cal was the signature win at home against then undefeated, No. 1 Arizona. In thrilling fashion, senior guard Justin Cobbs hits the game-winning jumper with 0.9 on the clock for a 60–58 victory.\nMike Montgomery announced his retirement shortly after the 2013–14 season's culmination, resulting in the hiring of Cuonzo Martin. The Bears went 18–15 in Martin's first season as head coach. On April 13, 2015, 5-star power forward Ivan Rabb of Bishop O'Dowd High School announced he would attend Cal. A little more than 2 weeks later, 5-star small forward Jaylen Brown announced he too would attend Cal, making this recruiting class the best in Cal history. While the team had a solid regular season, earning a #4 seed in the NCAA tournament, they were upset in the first round by Hawaii. After three seasons, Martin announced his resignation to become the head coach at Missouri. Shortly thereafter, Martin's assistant coach Wyking Jones became Cal's 17th head basketball coach. Jones coached for only two years, with the team finishing in the last place of the Pac-12 during both seasons. Former Georgia head coach Mark Fox was named Cal's 18th head basketball coach in 2019.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Golden Bears have appeared in 19 NCAA Tournaments. They were national champions in 1959 and their combined record is 20–19.\nNIT results.\nThe Golden Bears have appeared in nine National Invitation Tournaments (NIT). Their combined record is 14–8. They were NIT champions in 1999."

        "title": "George Hill (basketball)",
        "text": "George Jesse Hill Jr. (born May 4, 1986) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). While playing for Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) he received many honors, including Summit League Player of the Year and was an honorable mention All-American his junior season.\nHill was selected 26th overall by the San Antonio Spurs in the 2008 NBA draft and would spend three seasons with the team before being traded to the Indiana Pacers in June 2011. He spent five seasons in Indiana and was dealt to the Utah Jazz in July 2016. Hill signed with the Sacramento Kings as a free agent in July 2017, but was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in February 2018. With the Cavaliers, he made his first trip to the NBA Finals. In December 2018, Hill was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks. In November 2020, he was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, but was dealt to the Philadelphia 76ers in March 2021. Hill returned to the Bucks as a free agent in August of the same year before returning to the Pacers via a four-team trade.\nEarly life.\nBorn and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, Hill looked up to players like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird while dreaming of one day playing in the NBA; when asked about his goal of becoming a first-round pick in the 2008 NBA draft, Hill commented: \"It's my childhood dream\". He played basketball at St. Richard's Episcopal School. An only child, Hill attended Broad Ripple High School where he excelled as one of the top high school players in the state and was one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" from Indianapolis (with Greg Oden, Mike Conley Jr., Josh McRoberts, Rodney Carney, Eric Gordon, and Courtney Lee). Carney remembers playing against Hill: \"This little kid comes in hitting all kinds of 3s, and I was like, 'Who is this little dude?...I knew he was going to be something when I saw this little skinny kid handling the ball and shooting like that.\" Hill played against every member of the Magnificent Seven except Gordon, who was recovering from a broken wrist during their meetup. He faced off against Oden and Conley during his junior year in high school, and remembers playing pickup games against 10-year-old Gordon when he was 13.\nIn his senior year, Hill averaged a state-leading 36.2 points per game, the fifth-highest single-season average in Indiana High School Athletic Association history.\nCollege career.\nDespite scholarship offers from several big conference schools, including Temple and Indiana, he chose to commit to IUPUI, wishing to stay with his ailing great-grandfather, Gilbert Edison. A few months after he agreed to attend IUPUI, his great-grandfather died, never getting the opportunity to see Hill play basketball at the college level. Following his great-grandfather's advice to always be a man of his word, Hill decided to pass on other offers and stay at IUPUI.\nIn his sophomore year, he led the IUPUI Jaguars to a tie for the best record in the conference.\nFollowing an injury that forced him to become a redshirt in his third year at IUPUI, Hill returned the next season and led the Jaguars to a school-record 26 wins and the Summit League Tournament finals before losing to eventual champion Oral Roberts University and thus failing to secure a spot in the NCAA tournament.\nNot counting Hill's injury-shortened 2006–07 season, the Jaguars were 61–30 during his three seasons at IUPUI.\nDespite having one year of eligibility left, Hill, wishing to \"test the waters\", declared himself eligible for the 2008 NBA draft. He left IUPUI as the fifth all-time leading scorer with 1,619 points, and became the second IUPUI player to declare early after Carlos Knox in 1997 (he later withdrew his name).\nProfessional career.\nSan Antonio Spurs (2008–2011).\nAlthough he had regularly attracted NBA scouts to his college games, Hill was not projected in most mock drafts largely due to remaining unannounced.\nIn the following months, Hill worked out with several NBA teams. After an impressive run at the Orlando pre-draft rookie camp, Hill attracted attention and became a projected second-round selection. On draft night, the San Antonio Spurs surprised many by selecting Hill with their 26th pick in the first round; many expected the Spurs to select Mario Chalmers of Kansas. Hill became the second first-round draft choice in The Summit League's history and the first player ever drafted from IUPUI. On September 23, 2008, the Spurs signed Hill to a standard rookie contract that guaranteed the first two years and included a team option on the next two years.\n2008–09 season.\nOn July 14, 2008, in his first summer league game as a Spur, Hill scored 17 points and grabbed 8 rebounds while holding fellow draft pick O. J. Mayo to 5-of-17 shooting en route to a victory for the Spurs. Throughout the summer league Hill struggled with his shooting, making only 2 of 25 shots (8.0%), and one of six three-pointers (16.7%). Hill played in all but one of the four summer league games for the Spurs; he finished averaging 8.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 3.0 assists in 31.7 minutes per game.\nAt the Utah Revue, Hill led his team by averaging 12.9 points over four games; however he continued to struggle offensively with his shooting, only making 21.4% of his three-point field goals.\nIn the first of the four games, Hill led all scorers with 21 points and helped the Spurs defeat the Utah Jazz, 82–57. He followed up with a quiet offensive performance, 6 points, in a win against the NBDL Ambassadors, before scoring 18 points in a loss versus the Gerald Green-led Mavericks. In the final game of the Revue, Hill once again struggled with his shooting (1–7) but managed to make key plays with the game on the line. Hill made two clutch free throws with 6.9 seconds left and then forced a turnover on the defensive end to beat the previously undefeated Atlanta Hawks.\nIn 2008, Hill joined the San Antonio Spurs and made his NBA debut on November 4 against the Dallas Mavericks in the third game of the season. He had sat out the previous two games due to a sprained left thumb. In 15 minutes of play, Hill finished with 11 points, 1 steal, and 1 assist. Hill initially served as the main reserve at point guard, but after Tony Parker suffered an injury early in the season he was promoted to starter. After the return of Parker and Manu Ginóbili, Hill received fewer minutes. He finished his rookie season averaging 5.7 points per game, 2.1 rebounds per game, and 1.8 assists per game. Hill made his playoff debut in game 2 of the Spurs first-round series against the Mavs, but only played 5 minutes.\n2009–10 season.\nHill spent most of his off-season working on his point-guard skills, supervised by player development coach Chad Forcier, and his jump shots with Spurs shooting coach Chip Engelland. Following the advice of former Spur Bruce Bowen, he focused on developing his corner three-point shot. By the time training camp arrived, Hill had converted 8,000 threes.\nHis hard work during the off-season paid large dividends as soon as the 2009–10 season commenced. Hill saw his minutes increase from 16.5 to 29 a game. He also started in 43 games, most of them while Tony Parker was battling injuries. Hill more than doubled his scoring average, improved his field goal percentage by 7.5 percentage points, and his 3-pt shooting by 7.9 percentage points. On April 1, Hill notched career highs of 30 points, 5 steals, and 7 assists in a home game win against the Houston Rockets. Hill ended the regular season tied at second place with Kevin Durant and Marc Gasol for the Most Improved Player of the Year award. All three garnered a total of 101 points.\nThe Spurs' first-round playoff series with the Mavs was a breakout series for Hill. He was ineffective in Game 1, scoring 0 points in 17 minutes after coming back from an ankle injury. He shook off his tentativeness in the next few games, scoring 7 and 17 points in Games 2 and 3. Then Hill led the Spurs to a Game 4 victory on a night when the Spurs' Big Three of Duncan, Parker, and Ginobili shot a combined 9-of-34 from the field. Hill scored a career playoff high 29 points, shooting 11–16 from the field and 5–6 from 3-point range. Hill averaged 22.3 points in the series, helping the Spurs to win the series in six games.\n2010–11 season.\nOn March 28, 2011, Hill matched his career high of 30 points in a 119–114 loss to the Houston Rockets.\nIndiana Pacers (2011–2016).\nHill was traded to his hometown team the Indiana Pacers during the 2011 NBA draft on June 23, 2011, a trade that sent rights to the 15th overall pick Kawhi Leonard, the 42nd pick, Dāvis Bertāns, and 2005 draftee Erazem Lorbek to the Spurs in exchange for Hill.\nHill started the shortened season as a backup for Darren Collison. On January 31, 2012, Hill left the game against the New Jersey Nets after suffering an ankle injury. The Pacers announced it was a small chip fracture. He missed 12 games with the injury and returned on February 22, against the Charlotte Bobcats. On April 9, 2012, Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced that Hill would start for the injured Collison. Although Collison returned from the injury, Hill remained a starter for the rest of the season. Hill finished the season averaging 9.6 points per game with a field goal percentage of .442.\nDuring their first-round playoff series against the Orlando Magic, Hill scored double-digits in all five games as the Pacers advanced to the Eastern Conferences Semifinal. Facing the Miami Heat in the Conference Semifinals, Hill scored a playoff high 20 points and 5 assists in game 3. The Heat won the next 3 games, advancing to the Conference Finals and eventually becoming NBA champions.\nOn July 13, 2012, Hill re-signed with the Pacers to a reported five-year, $40 million contract.\nDuring the 2012–13 season, Hill made a game-winning floater against the Toronto Raptors and a game-winning layup over the outstretched arms of Dwight Howard against the Los Angeles Lakers. Hill and the Pacers appeared in the Eastern Conference Finals, but lost to the defending champion Miami Heat in 7 games.\nHill perhaps had the best game of his NBA career on February 7, 2014, when he scored a career-high 37 points in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers along with 9 rebounds and 8 assists including a game-tying three-pointer to force the game to overtime.\nAfter missing the first 28 games of the season with a left knee injury, Hill returned to action on December 23 against the New Orleans Pelicans. In just over 21 minutes of action off the bench, he recorded 15 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists and 1 steal in the 96–84 win.\nOn February 27, 2015, Hill recorded his first career triple-double with 15 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists in a 93–86 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. On March 14, he scored a season-high 30 points in an 89–93 loss to the Boston Celtics.\nOn February 19, 2016, Hill had nine points and nine assists and matched a career-high with 11 rebounds in the Pacers' 101–98 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nUtah Jazz (2016–2017).\nOn July 7, 2016, Hill was traded to the Utah Jazz in a three-team deal involving the Pacers and the Atlanta Hawks. He made his debut for the Jazz in their season opener on October 25 against the Portland Trail Blazers, recording 19 points and six assists in a 113–104 loss. On November 7, he was named Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, October 31 through Sunday, November 6. Hill helped the Jazz to a 3–1 week behind averages of 20.8 points, 5.8 assists and 3.3 rebounds. On November 23, he scored 22 points in his return from an eight-game absence, as the Jazz snapped a four-game losing streak with a 108–83 win over the Denver Nuggets.

The deal was fully guaranteed for its first two seasons, with only $1 million guaranteed for the 2019–20 season.\nCleveland Cavaliers (2018).\nOn February 8, 2018, Hill was acquired by the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three-team trade that also involved the Kings and the Utah Jazz. Although the Cavs made their 4th straight Finals appearance. Hill missed a game winning free throw attempt in regulation of game 1 of the NBA finals. Teammate JR Smith got Hill's free-throw rebound with 4.7 seconds left in regulation time. The game was tied, meaning that a field goal would have won the game. Smith, apparently confused and, thinking the Cavaliers were winning, attempted to dribble out the clock before realizing his error and frantically passing to George Hill with 1.2 seconds left, in front of a visibly irate LeBron James. The Cavaliers lost 124–114 in overtime. The missed free throw allowed for the game to head into overtime. The Cavs would eventually be swept in the finals in 4 games by the defending champion Golden State Warriors.\nMilwaukee Bucks (2018–2020).\nOn December 7, 2018, Hill was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a five-player, three-team deal that also included the Washington Wizards.

Following the 2019 season, Hill signed a 3-year, $29 million contract to remain with the Milwaukee Bucks. On October 28, 2019, Hill scored 19 points and grabbed 8 rebounds in a 129–112 win over his former team, the Cavaliers.\nIn his first full season with the Bucks in 2019–20, he led the NBA in three-point field goal percentage. Hill was integral in organizing a wildcat strike of players during the 2020 NBA bubble in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake and other instances of police violence. Despite finishing with the best record in the Eastern Conference at 56–17, the Bucks were defeated in the NBA Bubble during the Conference Semifinals by the 5th seeded Miami Heat in 5 games.\nOklahoma City Thunder (2020–2021).\nOn November 24, 2020, Hill was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in a four team deal also involving the New Orleans Pelicans and Denver Nuggets.

On August 3, he was waived by the 76ers.\nReturn to Milwaukee (2021–2023).\nOn August 6, 2021, Hill returned to the Milwaukee Bucks on a 2-year, $8 million contract.

On May 7, Hill returned to Milwaukee's rotation, playing 11 minutes during a 103–101 Game 3 win over the Boston Celtics in the second round.\nReturn to Indiana (2023).\nOn February 9, 2023, Hill was traded back to his hometown Indiana Pacers alongside Jordan Nwora and Serge Ibaka in a four-team trade involving the Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns, reuniting him with his hometown team after seven years.\nPlayer profile.\nOn draft day, ESPN reported that Hill had a 6'9\" wingspan. Hill's athleticism, length, and strength are among his greatest assets; going into the NBA he was said to have \"NBA-ready\" defense but to still need improvement offensively.\nSpurs head coach Gregg Popovich said, \"He does a little bit of everything. The great thing about him is that he's a very good all-around basketball player, he's a tenacious defender, he can score, he can run, he's a good passer, he knows how to play and he's really a team guy\". When asked on multiple occasions which current NBA player he most resembled, Hill picked Monta Ellis, adding that he saw himself as a combo guard and an energy player who enjoys playing defense and getting into the passing lanes. Hill was drafted by the Spurs to back up All-Star Tony Parker at point guard.\nPersonal life.\nOn January 16, 2016, Hill's girlfriend, Samantha, gave birth to the couple's first child, Zayden Jaxon Hill. On January 4, 2018, Samantha gave birth to their second child, Zoë Jessie Hill. They were married August 13, 2018. Hill received his diploma from IUPUI from the School of Liberal Arts on May 12, 2018. He was one of two student speakers to address the new graduates.\nHill owns an 850-acre ranch in Texas Hill Country, a 35-minute drive north of his offseason home in San Antonio. He employs 16 ranch workers to tend to the big herbivores he houses on his ranch. There are dozens of species on the ranch such as fallow deer, sables, kangaroos, wildebeests, donkeys, elk, antelope, scimitar oryx, Arabian oryx, red lechwes, New Zealand red stags, kudus, ostriches, and zebras among others."

        "text": "Today at Wimbledon is a BBC TV show, showing highlights and discussion from the day's play at the Wimbledon Championships currently hosted by Clare Balding. The show lasts for 60 minutes and is broadcast on BBC Two at 8:30 pm.\nOrigins.\nThe BBC (the UK host broadcaster of the Championships) began broadcasting Wimbledon in 1937. David Coleman hosted the live coverage from 1964 to 1966 and from 1968 to 1969. Harry Carpenter hosted the live coverage in 1967 and from 1970 to 1990 (and in some years also hosted the evening highlights programme). Des Lynam fronted Wimbledon live coverage on BBC television from 1991 to 1997 and in 1999 (Steve Rider hosted the live coverage in 1998). After Wimbledon 1999, Lynam moved to ITV and was replaced from 2000 by Sue Barker who hosted Wimbledon live coverage on BBC television until 2022.\nBroadcast history.\nThe evening highlights programme was initially broadcast late evening on BBC2 when the channel launched in 1964 and titled \"Wimbledon: Match of the Day\". It moved to BBC1 in 1984, in the era when Des Lynam hosted with Gerald Williams as a studio guest. It was renamed \"Today at Wimbledon\" in 1990 and moved back to BBC2 in 1997 when it was allotted a fixed start time of 9.30 pm before moving again to an 8:30 pm slot in 2005 and the following year to an even earlier start time of 8.00 pm in 2006 as BBC2 schedules non-sports output between 9 pm and 10.30 pm. As a result, if significant matches last beyond that time the programme is usually cut short (and occasionally not shown at all) to allow the live tennis coverage to be shown, which attract regular viewers.\nUntil 2023, it was presented either from the BBC's dedicated studio in the Wimbledon media centre, or from the landscaped garden on the building's roof, adjacent to court 18. From 2023, the show's format was revamped and is now entirely pre-recorded earlier in the day, allowing for the programme to aired each night during the championships - any nights in which live tennis continues beyond 9:00pm results in the programme being uploaded onto BBC iPlayer instead of being shown on BBC Two.\nThe theme music is from \"Sporting Occasion\" by Leslie Statham.\nWimbledon 2day.\nIn 2015, the programme was rebranded \"Wimbledon 2day\" (a pun on the channel's name). Clare Balding became the new presenter after long-time host John Inverdale left to join the BBC's Wimbledon commentary team. The opening week was presented from The Gatsby Club – a temporary hospitality venue outside the grounds – with stand-up presentation, handheld cameras, various social media features and a small live audience. The changes prompted many complaints, in particular the reduction in highlights. The BBC tweaked the format in the second week, Balding hosting a more traditional show, without an audience, from the upper floor of Centre Court with views across the grounds.\nFor 2016, the show returned to the \"Today at Wimbledon\" name and format."

        "text": "David Alan Robertson (born April 9, 1985), nicknamed \"D-Rob\", is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, Tampa Bay Rays, Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets, and Miami Marlins.\nRobertson played college baseball for the Alabama Crimson Tide. He was drafted by the Yankees in the 17th round of the 2006 MLB draft and made his MLB debut with the Yankees in 2008. Robertson was a member of the Yankees team that won the 2009 World Series. He was named an MLB All-Star in 2011. After Mariano Rivera retired, Robertson served as the Yankees' closer in 2014. He signed with the White Sox as a free agent after the 2014 season and was traded back to the Yankees in July 2017. Robertson signed with the Phillies as a free agent after the 2018 season.\nAmateur career.\nRobertson was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and played his first three years of high school baseball at Central-Tuscaloosa High School in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He was a two-year starter for the Falcons at shortstop and pitcher. He helped lead his team to back-to-back area titles, as well as back-to-back 6A State Playoff appearances. After his junior year, Central High School was split into three smaller high schools, and Robertson attended Paul W. Bryant High School in Tuscaloosa, graduating in 2004. He led the Stampede to an area title and the Class 6A State Playoffs in the school's first year of existence.\nRobertson enrolled at the University of Alabama and played college baseball for the Alabama Crimson Tide. As a freshman in 2005, Robertson appeared in a team-high 32 games with three games started. He compiled a 7–5 win–loss record with eight saves and a 2.92 earned run average (ERA), and set the single-season rookie record for most strikeouts (105). He led the Southeastern Conference (SEC) by limiting hitters to a .183 batting average. He was named Freshman All-SEC and Freshman All-American by \"Baseball America\", Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American, and \"Collegiate Baseball Magazine\" Freshman All-American.\nIn his sophomore season, Robertson helped lead the Crimson Tide to their 25th SEC Championship. He appeared in 29 games, compiling a 4–4 record with a 3.02 ERA. He led the SEC with 10 saves. In 2006, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox and was named the most valuable player of the playoffs in Yarmouth-Dennis' championship season.\nMinor leagues.\nDue to Robertson being 21 at the time of the 2006 MLB draft, he was a draft-eligible sophomore and the New York Yankees selected him in the 17th round. He signed with the Yankees for a $200,000 signing bonus.\nIn 2007, pitching for the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League, the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, and the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League, he was a combined 8–3 with four saves and an 0.96 ERA in innings, allowing 45 hits while striking out 114 batters, averaging 12.1 strikeouts per nine innings. Robertson was a 2007 mid-season South Atlantic League All Star. He was third among minor league relievers, with a .154 opponents batting average.\nIn 2008, pitching for Trenton and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Triple-A International League, he was 4–0 with three saves and a 1.68 ERA in innings, allowing 28 hits while striking out 77, averaging 12.9 strikeouts per nine innings. He was named the International League's \"Best Reliever\" of 2008 in \"Baseball America\"'s Best Tools survey. Pitching for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in 2009, he was 0–3 with two saves and a 1.84 ERA with 25 strikeouts in innings, averaging 15.3 strikeouts per nine innings. In 2012 he pitched two scoreless innings for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\nMajor leagues.\nNew York Yankees (2008–2014).\n2008–2011.\nOn June 28, 2008, the Yankees called Robertson up from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. On August 28, the Yankees optioned him back to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre with a 6.31 ERA. He was recalled back to MLB on September 13. He appeared in 25 MLB games in 2008, going 4–0 with a save and a 5.34 ERA, and 51 strikeouts in 34 innings, averaging 13.1 strikeouts per nine innings.\nAfter starting the 2009 regular season in Triple-A, Robertson was recalled to MLB on April 16, to replace Xavier Nady, who had been placed on the 15-day disabled list. The next day he was optioned back to Triple-A to open a roster spot for Juan Miranda. On May 25, he was again recalled to MLB, to replace reliever Brian Bruney. Robertson finished the season 2–1 with a save and a 3.30 ERA and 63 strikeouts in innings, averaging 13.0 strikeouts per nine innings (among pitchers with at least 40 innings pitched, the second-best ratio in MLB behind Jonathan Broxton (13.50).\nIn the 2009 playoffs, Robertson entered two games in high-pressure situations with multiple runners on base, once in the ALDS and once in the ALCS, and did not allow any runs to score. Robertson received the win in each of those games. The Yankees won the 2009 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies.\nRobertson finished the 2010 season with a 4–5 record, one save, a 3.82 ERA, and 71 strikeouts in innings, averaging 10.4 strikeouts per nine innings.\nIn Game 6 of the 2010 ALCS against the Texas Rangers, Robertson relieved Phil Hughes in the fifth inning and surrendered a two-run home run to Nelson Cruz which gave the Rangers a 5–1 lead; the Rangers would win the game 6–1 to take the AL pennant.\nThe Yankees entered the 2011 season with the additions of relief pitchers Pedro Feliciano and Rafael Soriano. Robertson lost out to Joba Chamberlain to be the seventh inning specialist whom manager Joe Girardi wanted to bridge to Soriano and closer Mariano Rivera. Injuries to Feliciano, Soriano, and Chamberlain put Robertson in the eighth inning setup role, where he had 55 strikeouts halfway through the season. Robertson was named to the 2011 American League All-Star roster, replacing David Price.\nRobertson finished his breakout 2011 season 4–0 with a save, 34 holds (tied for the AL lead), leading the league in ERA (1.08), along with a 13.5 strikeouts per nine innings ratio (second in the AL, and the highest ratio by a Yankee reliever in franchise history), and an MLB-leading adjusted ERA+ of 410, in 70 games pitched (fifth in the AL). He finished the season with 100 strikeouts (leading all AL relievers) in innings, becoming the first Yankee reliever since Rivera (in 1996) to record 100 strikeouts in a single season. He struck out the 300th batter of his career in career innings on June 24, making him the third-fastest pitcher in major league history to reach that mark after Billy Wagner () and Brad Lidge (). He received one point in the voting for both the AL Cy Young Award (the only non-starter or non-closer to receive a vote) and AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award (the only reliever to receive a vote). Robertson also won the \"This Year in Baseball\" Setup Man of the Year Award.\n2012–2014.\nIn January 2012, the Yankees and Robertson agreed on a one-year non-guaranteed contract to avoid arbitration.\nWhen Rivera went down with a season-ending injury in May 2012, Girardi announced that Robertson and Soriano would share the duties of closing games for the remainder of the season. Robertson himself was placed on the 15-day disabled list however on May 15, after he strained a muscle in his rib cage, 12 days after Rivera's season-ending injury. He returned to action on June 15, but after several appearances became the setup man for Soriano. Robertson finished the 2012 season with a record of 2–7, a 2.67 ERA, two saves, and 30 holds (tied for third in the AL) in 65 games, with 81 strikeouts in innings, averaging 12.0 strikeouts per nine innings.\nIn 2013, Robertson served as the eighth inning setup reliever behind Rivera. He appeared in 70 games, going 5–1 with three saves and 33 holds (second in the AL) and a 2.04 ERA and 77 strikeouts in innings, averaging 10.4 strikeouts per nine innings.\nRivera retired after the 2013 season. During spring training in 2014, Robertson was named the Yankees' closer. On April 7, Robertson was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a groin strain.\nRobertson had a 4–5 record and a 3.08 ERA in 2014, was successful on 39 (third in the AL) out of 44 save attempts, and struck out 96 batters in innings, averaging 13.4 strikeouts per nine innings. In his lone season as Yankees' closer, Robertson garnered praise as a worthy successor to Rivera. He was paid $5.215 million in 2014. On November 10, Robertson declined the Yankees' $15.3-million qualifying offer for the 2015 season, making him a free agent.\nChicago White Sox (2015–2017).\nAfter the 2014 season, Robertson became a free agent. He subsequently agreed to a four-year, $46 million contract with the Chicago White Sox. Robertson served as the White Sox closer during his tenure in Chicago. In his first season with the White Sox, Robertson compiled a 6–5 record with 34 saves (sixth in the AL), a 3.41 ERA, and 86 strikeouts in innings, averaging 12.2 strikeouts per nine innings. He blew seven saves, but struck out 34.4% of batters and lowered his walk rate to a career-best 5.2%, averaging 1.8 walks per nine innings. He limited the first batters he faced to a .100 batting average, the lowest rate in both the AL and in White Sox history.\nIn his second season as the White Sox closer, Robertson earned 37 saves (fourth in the AL), pitching to a 5–3 record and 3.47 ERA while striking out 75 batters in innings, averaging 10.8 strikeouts per nine innings. Robertson suffered seven blown saves, with his walk rate rising (4.62 BB/9).\nRobertson pitched for the gold-medal-winning Team USA in the 2017 World Baseball Classic.\nWith the White Sox in rebuilding mode, Robertson became enshrouded in trade rumors during the offseason and regular season. Robertson was nearly traded to the Washington Nationals for Jesus Luzardo and Drew Ward; however, the deal was not completed due to disagreements regarding finances. In 2017 for the White Sox Robertson had a 4–2 record with 13 saves and a 2.70 ERA, and 47 strikeouts in innings, averaging 12.8 strikeouts per nine innings, before getting traded to the Yankees.\nReturn to the Yankees (2017–2018).\nOn July 18, 2017, the White Sox traded Robertson, Todd Frazier, and Tommy Kahnle to the New York Yankees for Blake Rutherford, Tyler Clippard, Ian Clarkin, and Tito Polo. In his first appearance after the trade, Robertson struck out the side in the seventh inning to preserve a 5–1 lead against the Seattle Mariners. In the 2017 regular season for the Yankees, he was 5–0 with a save and a 1.03 ERA, and 51 strikeouts in 35 innings, averaging 13.1 strikeouts per nine innings.\nIn the 2017 American League Wild Card Game, Robertson set career post-season single-game highs in innings pitched, with , and pitches thrown, with 52. He allowed no runs and earned the win.\nIn 2018, Robertson was 8–3 with five saves, 21 holds (tied for eighth in the AL), and a 3.23 ERA, and 91 strikeouts in a career-high innings, averaging 11.8 strikeouts per nine innings. His WHIP ranked seventh among AL relievers who pitched at least 60 innings. Batters hit .183 against Robertson. Left-handed batters hit .176 with a .240 on-base percentage against him; both in the top eight among pitchers who faced 130 or more lefties. Pitching against the number 3 and 4 hitters in opposing lineups, he held them to a batting average of .074, as they were 4-for-54 with 22 strikeouts.\nThrough 2018, in his 11-year career Robertson had a lifetime 2.88 ERA with 137 saves in 654 games pitched (10th among active players). He had averaged 11.97 strikeouts per nine innings, the most of any active pitcher with at least 650 career innings pitched, and had never averaged a season strikeout rate of less than 10.4. He became the only pitcher in major league history to average at least 10 strikeouts/9 innings pitched in each of his first 11 seasons. In his career through 2018, lefties had a .188 batting average and a .546 on-base plus slugging (OPS) against him, and righties had a .222 batting average and a .667 OPS. He was one of 12 pitchers in American League history to appear in 60 games in nine consecutive seasons. He received the Thurman Munson Award in 2018.\nPhiladelphia Phillies (2019–2020).\nAs a free agent, Robertson self-negotiated and signed a two-year, $23 million contract, which included a third-year $12 million club option and $2 million buyout, with the Philadelphia Phillies on January 3, 2019. He donated one percent of his salary to the Phillies' charity fund.\nRobertson made his Phillies pitching debut on March 28, 2019, at Citizens Bank Park, against the visiting Atlanta Braves. In 2019, he did not appear in a game after April 14 due to a Grade 1 flexor strain in his pitching elbow; it was determined later that it required season-ending Tommy John surgery. In 2019, he was 0–1 with a 5.40 ERA, pitching 6 innings in seven games. Robertson underwent surgery on August 17, 2019. As of the end of the 2019 season, his career 661 games pitched were eighth-most of all active major league pitchers.\nOn August 28, 2020, Robertson suffered a setback during his recovery from Tommy John surgery and was immediately shut down from throwing, effectively ending his season without making an appearance. His option was bought out after the season, making him a free agent.\nHigh Point Rockers and Tampa Bay Rays (2021).\nOn July 12, 2021, Robertson signed with the High Point Rockers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, to help prepare for the 2020 Summer Olympics (contested in 2021). He pitched with the team from July 13 to July 15, earning a win and not allowing a run in two appearances out of the bullpen.\nFollowing the Olympics, Robertson signed with the Tampa Bay Rays on August 16, 2021. Robertson made his major league season debut on September 1, 2021 with the Rays.\nChicago Cubs (2022).\nOn March 16, 2022, Robertson signed a one-year contract with the Chicago Cubs. On June 22, 2022, Robertson got his first MLB at bat, in his 696th game, borrowing gear from his teammates. Though he struck out against the Pittsburgh Pirates’ Diego Castillo, he is quoted as saying, \"made my dream come true”.\nReturn to Philadelphia (2022).\nOn August 2, 2022, the Cubs traded Robertson to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for pitcher Ben Brown.\nIn 2022 between both teams he was 4–3 with 20 saves (8th in the NL) in 58 games and a 2.40 ERA in 63 innings in which he struck out 81 batters. His 731 career games played were 8th-most of all active pitchers, as were his 157 career saves.\nNew York Mets (2023).\nOn December 9, 2022, Robertson signed a one-year contract with the New York Mets. On May 12, 2023, Robertson recorded the 1,000th strikeout of his MLB career, becoming just the 14th relief pitcher to do so.\nMiami Marlins (2023).\nOn July 28, 2023, the Mets traded Robertson to the Miami Marlins in exchange for catcher Ronald Hernández and infielder Marco Vargas. He became a free agent following the season.\nTexas Rangers (2024–present).\nOn January 26, 2024, Robertson signed a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers that contained a mutual option for the following season.\nInternational career.\nRobertson played for the champion United States national baseball team at the 2017 World Baseball Classic, getting the final outs against Puerto Rico in the gold medal game.\nIn May 2021, Robertson was named to the roster of the national team for qualifying for baseball at the 2020 Summer Olympics. After the team qualified, he was named to the Olympics roster on July 2. The team went on to win silver, falling to Japan in the gold-medal game.\nPitching style.\nWith an overhand delivery, Robertson throws a four-seam fastball typically at . Robertson's main off-speed pitch is a curveball in the low 80s. Infrequently, he throws a circle changeup to left-handed hitters in the mid-high 80s. Although Robertson's fastball speed is not unusually high, his long stride toward home plate during his delivery appears to \"add\" to his fastball by shortening the ball's time in flight. His fastball also has a \"natural cut\" to it, making it appear as if he is throwing a cut fastball.\nRobertson has always had a high walk rate (about one every two to three innings over his career), but this is mitigated by an outstanding strikeout rate; Robertson has averaged at least one strikeout per inning in every year of his career so far. His high strikeout rate has proved useful in critical late-inning situations — in 2011, Robertson struck out 14 of the 19 hitters he faced with the bases loaded and allowed only one hit. His ability to get out of jams has earned him the nickname \"Houdini\".\nPersonal life.\nHis brother, Connor, played in MLB for the Oakland Athletics and the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nRobertson married Erin Cronin in 2009. They have three children, a son Luke born in August 2012, a daughter Violet born in July 2017, and a son Rhett born in March 2022 . The family resides in Barrington, Rhode Island.\nRobertson and his wife started a charitable foundation called \"High Socks for Hope\" to help the victims of Robertson's hometown of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, deal with the tornado strikes in 2011. Robertson agreed to donate $100 for every strikeout he recorded in the season. For his work, Robertson was nominated for the 2011 Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award. Following the death of his former White Sox teammate Daniel Webb, Robertson set up a fundraiser for Webb's family through High Socks for Hope."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Brewers and New York Mets.\nHerrera became well known among baseball fans both for his small stature and for his unique pitch repertoire. He was one of the smallest pitchers in recent Major League Baseball history at 5' 6\", and one of the few to throw a true screwball.\nPlaying career.\nHerrera attended Permian High School in Odessa, Texas. Undrafted out of high school, he was chosen by the Texas Rangers in the 45th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft out of the University of New Mexico, where he played for the New Mexico Lobos baseball team. It was in college that Herrera developed his screwball (out of dissatisfaction with his changeup).\nCincinnati Reds.\nOn December 21, , Herrera was traded by the Rangers along with Edinson Vólquez to the Cincinnati Reds for Josh Hamilton.\nHe made his Major League debut on June 3, , pitching a scoreless inning. Entering the game with men on base and no outs, he induced Shane Victorino to ground out, and after an intentional walk to Chase Utley he struck out both Ryan Howard and Pat Burrell. Two days after his debut, he was optioned back to AAA Louisville to make room on the roster for starting pitcher Homer Bailey.\nHe was briefly recalled again on June 10, 2008; however, he was sent down just four days later when pitcher Gary Majewski returned from the bereavement list. He made just one appearance during his second stint, pitching two innings while giving up three runs on four hits, striking out two.\nIn 2009, Herrera made the Reds out of spring training. He recorded his first victory of his career on June 16, 2009, after relieving Aaron Harang in the top of the third inning following an extended rain delay. He pitched three scoreless innings, giving up two hits while striking out two.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn May 23, 2011, Herrera was claimed off waivers by the Milwaukee Brewers and optioned to the Nashville Sounds. He was designated for assignment on June 17, after making two appearances with Milwaukee.\nNew York Mets.\nOn September 1, 2011, Herrera was named as one of the players to be named later that completed the July 12, 2011 trade for Francisco Rodríguez. On January 9, 2012, the Mets placed Herrera on waivers. On April 3, 2012, he was optioned to the Buffalo Bisons.\nThe Mets released Herrera in March 2013.\nCamden Riversharks.\nHerrera signed with the Camden Riversharks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball for the 2014 season.\nHe became a free agent after the 2015 season.\nPitching style.\nHerrera threw six pitches. He had three fastballs — a four-seamer (83–86 mph, topped out at 88), a two-seamer (82–85), and a cutter (81–84) — as well as a curveball (75–78), a changeup (75–77), and a screwball (67–70). Herrera threw all of his pitches to hitters from both sides of the plate, with the exception of the changeup (which was only used against right-handed hitters). The screwball was his most common pitch in 2-strike counts, especially to righties. His most common pitch against left-handers as a whole was his curveball."

He is considered one of the best Chilean rugby players of all time, and was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2012.\nEarly life.\nHis father, Colin Campbell, was a Scottish-born emigrant, businessman, and amateur football player, who had played for Chile in the 1910 South American Championship.\nCareer.\nCampbell followed in the rugby footsteps of his older brother Donald Campbell, a Chile international who had been killed in action in 1944 while serving with the Royal Air Force. The younger Campbell began playing rugby at the Saint Peter's School, in Valparaíso. He went to play for Prince of Wales Country Club, where he was also the captain.\nCampbell was capped for the first time for Chile, on 5 September 1948 in a historical 21–3 win over Uruguay, in Buenos Aires. In fact, he never lost to the \"Teros\", when he played in the Chilean side, for the next 13 years. Campbell's best results were the runners-up title at the South American Championship three times, in 1951, 1958 and 1961. This last time, Chile lost narrowly to arch-rivals Argentina by 11–6, with Campbell missing five penalties.\nCampbell was then called \"the most skilful player in South America\".\nCampbell left the National team the same year, but still played until the 1970s. After that, he became a coach.\nCampbell's grandson, Santiago Fuenzalida, was a member of Chilean U-20 team for 2008 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy. He was killed in a car accident.\nIn 2012, Campbell was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame along with his brother Donald."

AITA is also responsible for organising and hosting tennis tournaments within India and scheduling the home international fixtures.\nHistory.\nTennis was introduced in India in the 1880s by British Army and civilian officers. Saleem of Lahore won the Punjab Championship in 1915 and thereafter consecutively from 1919 to 1926. In 1917 NS Iyer lifted the Bengal Championship. In 1919 Mr. Nagu picked up the prestigious singles crown at the All India Tennis Championship at City's Gymkhana Club at Allahabad. Henceforth, Indians started playing the game with greater distinction.\nIn March 1920 the All India Lawn Tennis Association was formed at Lahore. At this meeting the constitution and game laws were framed, along the lines of the Lawn Tennis Association of Britain. In November 1920, the first AGM of AILTA was held at the town hall at Delhi. Samuel Perry O'Donnell, a British member of the Indian Civil Service (ICS) was elected as the first president. In this meeting, it was decided to hold the annual 'All India National Championships' at Allahabad and to participate in Davis Cup competition. In its debut, Indian team consisting of SM Jacob, Mohd Saleem, LS Deane and AA Fayzee upset a stronger French team to reach the semi-finals. With AITA at the helm of affairs, different provinces formed Provincial Associations (now known as State Associations and were affiliated to parent organisation. An Inter Provincial Tournament was organised with effect from 1922. Punjab LTA led by Mohd Saleem became the first champions. This yearly competition continued till the eve of the Second World War (1939).\nAround the early 1980s the name of the association was changed to the \"All India Tennis Association\". From the beginning of the 1990s tennis in India has started getting a new look. The financial position of the association has improved considerably. The association constructed a full-fledged modern national stadium in Delhi with a seating capacity of 5000 spectators in 1996.\nHeadquarters.\nThe AITA organisation has its headquarters in Delhi's R.K. Khanna Tennis Complex. Until 1996, the organisation was functioning from temporary places.\nLondon Olympics.\nOn 15 June 2012, the All India Tennis Association chose Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi for the men's doubles event of the London Olympics.\nFormat of tournaments.\nAITA conducts the following types of tournaments:\nTournaments.\nListed below are tournaments that are/were part of the federation calendar."

        "text": " \nThe age requirements in gymnastics are established by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) and regulate the age at which athletes are allowed to participate in senior-level competitions.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, a series of controversies arose with regard to gymnast ages, some of them leading to sanctions by FIG, and paving the way for the age requirements to be raised from 14 to 15 in 1981, and then to 16 in 1997. \nHistory of age requirements in artistic gymnastics.\nPrior to 1981, the minimum required age to compete in senior events sanctioned by the FIG (including the Olympic Games) was 14. The earliest champions in women's gymnastics tended to be in their 20s; most had studied ballet for years before entering the sport. Hungarian gymnast Ágnes Keleti won individual gold medals at the age of 35 at the 1956 Olympics. Larisa Latynina, the first great Soviet gymnast, won her first Olympic all-around medal at the age of 21, her second at 25 and her third at 29; she became the 1958 World Champion while pregnant with her daughter. Czech gymnast Věra Čáslavská, who followed Latynina to become a two-time Olympic all-around champion, was 22 before she started winning gold medals at the highest level of the sport, and won her final Olympic all-around title at the age of 26.\nIn the 1970s, the average age of Olympic gymnastics competitors began to gradually decrease. While it was not unheard of for teenagers to compete in the 1960s — Ludmilla Tourischeva was sixteen at her first Olympics in 1968 — they slowly became the norm, as difficulty in gymnastics increased.\nBy the late 1970s, Federations occasionally requested permission to allow slightly underage athletes to compete as seniors. One such example is that of Canadian gymnast Karen Kelsall, who legally competed in the 1976 Olympics at the age of 13. At the time, gymnasts had to turn 14 by the start of the Games to be eligible. Kelsall, with her December 1962 birthday, was five months shy of the requirement but was turning 14 within the Olympic year, and was granted a special exemption by the FIG to compete. Such exemptions were not automatic, however: American gymnast Tracee Talavera, who was named to the United States team for the 1979 World Championships, was deemed ineligible to compete due to her age of years.\nIn response to the changing demands of the sport, at the 58th Congress of the FIG, held in July 1980 just before the Moscow Olympics, the minimum age was raised from 14 to 15. Under this rule, which went into effect in 1981, gymnasts were required to turn at least 15 years of age in the calendar year to compete in senior-level events. This age requirement remained in place until 1997, when it was raised one more year, from 15 to 16.\nReasons for age restrictions.\nAge restrictions were supposedly designed not so much to level the playing field in terms of skill and physical advantages, as to protect child athletes from injury. However, critics dispute the science behind the policy and argue that the answer is to prohibit junior gymnasts from competing in senior competitions.\nOn the one hand, proponents such as Jeanne Dopbrak, a sports medicine physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, contend that \"[a child athlete's] immature skeleton just isn't ready to handle the day-to-day stresses that will occur\", and that the stresses imposed on only partly developed muscular/skeletal system by gymnastics are almost certain to cause damage that would persist into adulthood. Proponents also point to a 16-year American study of gymnastics injuries which concluded that gymnastics is the most dangerous sport for girls, with injury rates comparable to those found in boys who play soccer, basketball and hockey. An athlete whose bones are still growing is more likely than an adult to suffer skeletal injury, because the bones are more porous and the joints not yet fully formed. Lesions, which are precursors to stress fractures, occur in 11% of young female gymnasts, compared to 2.3% of girls and women in general. The International Gymnastics Federation says that intense physical activity, such as that engaged in by gymnasts training at the elite level, affects the functioning of growth hormones, possibly causing delayed bone growth and the onset of puberty – although the body is able to recover and catch up later if given rest periods.\nIn addition, proponents contend that practicing elite sports is mentally and emotionally demanding. Young gymnasts at these levels are often pressured to perform by coaches and parents, and ex-gymnasts have spoken out about behavioural and psychological problems common to the sport.\nCurrent regulations.\nCurrently, per the 1997 regulation, gymnasts must be at least 16 years of age, or turning 16 within the calendar year, to compete in senior-level events. For the current Olympic cycle, in order to compete in the 2024 Olympics, a gymnast must have a birth date before January 1, 2009. There is no maximum age restriction, and some gymnasts compete well into their 20s. The oldest female gymnast competing in senior international events in 2023 is Uzbekistan's Oksana Chusovitina, (b. 1975) who was 46 years, 1 month old at the 2020 Summer Olympics. She was old at her first Olympics, the 1992 Summer Olympics.\nTerminology.\nThe term senior, in gymnastics, refers to any world-class gymnast who is age-eligible under F.I.G. rules. The term junior is used to describe any gymnast who competes at a world-class level, but does not meet the F.I.G.'s age minimum. Juniors are judged under the same Code of Points as the seniors, and often exhibit the same level of difficulty in their routines.\nLegal exceptions.\nThe one exception to the F.I.G.'s age restrictions until recently applied to the year before the Olympics, when gymnasts who were one year below the required age, but would be the required age in the Olympic year, were allowed to compete as seniors at the World Championships and other FIG meets. For instance, gymnasts born in 1977 were allowed to compete at senior events in 1991, when they were 14 or turning 14 within the calendar year. Within the last Olympic cycle, gymnasts born in 1992 were permitted to compete as seniors in 2007. This was permitted to allow nations to qualify to the Olympics with their best teams, and to give emerging gymnasts some experience in major competition before the Olympics. However, the FIG eliminated this exception as of the 2012 Olympic cycle.\nIn addition, the age requirement technically only applies to meets which are sanctioned and regulated directly by the FIG: the Olympics, the World Championships and the World Cup circuit. Many other meets, such as the European Championships, have separate divisions for juniors. Additionally, some competitions, such as the Pan Am Games, the Pacific Rim Championships and the All-Africa Games, have different rules which permit seniors and juniors to compete together. There are also numerous international competitions specifically limited to junior gymnasts, such as the Japan Junior International, Moscow World Stars, the Junior Pan American Championships, and the Youth Olympic Games.\nVerification procedures.\nAccording to official statements from the FIG, \"the accepted proof of a gymnast’s eligibility for competition is a valid passport issued by the country of residence.\" This verification process has been criticized by some in the gymnastics community, with the argument that countries can manufacture and submit falsified documents for underage athletes. In several cases, gymnasts involved in age falsification have verified that they did in fact compete under forged passports provided to them by their federations.\nSince 2009, gymnasts competing in FIG-sanctioned events at both the senior and junior level have been required to have licenses issued by the Federation. These licenses reportedly verify the competitors' ages based on their passports. However, the licensing does not include any independent verification of submitted passport information.\nResponse from coaches and federations.\nThe age limit is arguably one of the most contentious rules in gymnastics, and is frequently debated by coaches, gymnasts and members of the media. While some members of the sport, such as former USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi, have expressed support for the age limit of 16, others, such as coach Béla Károlyi, have heavily criticized it.\nSupporters of the age restrictions have pointed out that it has encouraged older gymnasts to remain in the sport. The average age of an international gymnast was 18.10 years in 2005. In contrast, in 1994, before the new age requirements, it was 16.49, and in 1989, gymnasts who had reached the age of 17 were already often considered to be of retirement age.\nOpponents of the rule have countered that by barring younger gymnasts from top level meets, they are denying them valuable competitive experience. They have also argued that junior gymnasts perform and are scored under the same \"Code of Points\" as the seniors, perform the same skills, and are thus not avoiding the physical impact of training and performing high-level skills. It is also argued that the current \"Code of Points\", with its increased requirements for difficult skills, is more suited to younger and lighter athletes, and puts older athletes at greater risk of injury.\nAge falsification.\nAge falsification is the practice of advancing gymnasts' ages to make them age-eligible for senior-level competition. Reports of age falsification among top-level international gymnasts first began to surface in the 1980s, after the age limit was raised from 14 to 15. This has frequently taken the form of inconsistently reported birthdates; at other times, speculation has been raised due to the young appearance of the gymnasts. Age falsification has been revealed and confirmed in several ways. In some cases, gymnasts themselves have come forward and publicly confirmed and verified the falsification. In other cases, documents revealing inconsistencies, such as original birth certificates, have been researched and uncovered by the press. Inconsistencies with reported birth dates and ages at international and national competitions have also led to the discovery of age falsification.\nGymnasts who have had their ages falsified, and have spoken about their experiences, have indicated that they were not given a choice in the matter. In a 2002 interview, Romanian gymnast Daniela Silivaş, whose age was advanced two years in the 1980s, noted: \"One of the officials of the Federation told me 'Look at the passport, from today you're not 13 years old anymore but 15.' Nobody asked me if I agreed to this, I was just a child. They needed gold medals and everybody who was involved in gymnastics knew about these practices.\"\nWhile age falsification has been denied among many gymnastics officials, in recent years some have publicly admitted that the practice has occurred. In reference to the falsifications of the early 1990s and 1980s, the head of the Romanian Gymnastics Federation, Nicolae Vieru, was quoted in 2002: \"Changing the ages was a worldwide practice ... we copied this from others.\" The FIG has publicly stated that they view age falsification as an unacceptable practice. However, there have only been three cases, those of Kim Gwang Suk in 1993 and Dong Fangxiao and Hong Su Jong in 2010, where the FIG has elected to take any action against a gymnastics federation for age falsification.\nReasons for age falsification.\nAccording to many scientific and medical studies, as well as reports from ex-gymnasts, younger gymnasts may have psychological or physical advantages in elite gymnastics competition.\nPsychologically, younger gymnasts may be more fearless, and have less visceral appreciation for the potential for injury. They are therefore more likely to perform more dangerous, and more highly scored, routines with confidence and steadiness. Olympic medallist Nellie Kim told \"The New York Times\" that \"Psychologically, I think they worry less\". Daniela Silivaş, in her interview, commented, \"You should know that I competed better at the age of 13 than at 17. I felt much better, physical and mentally.\"\nPhysically, younger gymnasts, particularly those who have not yet gone through puberty, tend to be lighter, smaller, more pliable and flexible, which aids them in performing more complex skills and gives them a better strength-to-weight ratio. When a gymnast hits puberty, growth spurts and weight gain may affect her centre of gravity, causing mental and physical stress as she must adjust, and in some cases relearn, her moves to compensate. Smaller athletes have generally excelled in the more challenging acrobatic elements required by the evolving Code of Points after the 1960s. In addition, older gymnasts may be more prone to certain types of injuries caused by overuse of bones and muscles; younger gymnasts are less likely to have such problems, or more likely to be able to work through pain while injured.\nMajor verified cases of age falsification.\nKim Gwang Suk (North Korea): Kim, the 1991 World Champion on the uneven bars, was active on the international circuit between 1987 and 1993. During this time, several observers claimed she was too young for senior competition. The North Korean Gymnastics Federation submitted inconsistent dates of birth for Kim at various competitions, claiming that she was 15 for three consecutive years. As punishment, the FIG barred the North Korean women's team from the World Championships in 1993. She competed in the 1989 World Championships at the estimated age of 11 or 12. However, she may have been younger than that. At the 1992 Olympics, she claimed she was 17. However, her front teeth were missing, leading Béla Károlyi to speculate that she may have been as young as 10 at the time.\nLavinia Agache (Romania): Agache competed at the 1981 World Championships at the age of 13, under a passport which gave her year of birth as 1967. She was in fact born in 1968. The falsification was suspected as early as 1981; Agache confirmed her 1968 birthdate to \"International Gymnast\" magazine in 2000.\nOlga Bicherova (Soviet Union): Bicherova, the 1981 World Champion in the all-around event, was introduced at an early 1981 meet as a 12-year-old, but was claimed to have been born in 1966 at the 1981 World Championships later in the same year.\nGina Gogean (Romania): Gogean competed in the 1992 Olympics with a passport with a 1977 birth year. However, in 2002 her original birth certificate was uncovered by the media, revealing she had been born in 1978.\nAlexandra Marinescu (Romania): Marinescu, a World and team Olympic medalist in the mid-1990s, was given an earlier birth year from 1982 to 1981 in order to be eligible for the 1995 World Championships and 1996 Olympic Games.\nOlga Mostepanova (Soviet Union): Mostepanova, who competed at the 1983 and 1985 World Championships and was the all-around gold medalist at the 1984 Friendship Games, has been reported as having 1968 and 1969 birth dates, but has stated that she was actually born in 1970.\nDaniela Silivaş (Romania): Silivaş, a multiple World and Olympic gold medalist, competed as a junior until 1985, when her birth year was changed from 1972 to 1970. She went on to compete at the 1985 World Championships at the age of 13. Silivaş revealed the falsification to the media in 2002 during her marriage licence application in Georgia, where she resides in the Atlanta metropolitan area.\nDong Fangxiao (People's Republic of China): Dong was a member of the bronze-medal winning Chinese team at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Her birthdate was listed as January 20, 1983, in the FIG database. However, it was discovered that her accreditation as a technical official at the 2008 Summer Olympics, where she worked as a vault secretary, listed her birthdate as January 23, 1986. Additionally, her blog stated she was born during the Year of the Ox, which would place her birthdate between February 1985 and February 1986. An FIG investigation determined in 2010 that Dong was 14 during the 2000 Olympics and the Chinese team should be stripped of its bronze medal. Dong's 1999 World Championships and World Cup results were vacated. In April 2010, the International Olympic Committee upheld the FIG's recommendation and nullified both the Chinese team's bronze medal and Dong's individual Olympic placement.\nHong Su Jong (North Korea), the 2007 World Championships silver medalist on vault, was investigated for age discrepancies in 2010. Hong competed at the 2004 Olympics with a March 9, 1985, birth date, but participated in subsequent Asian Games and World Championships meets with a 1986 year of birth. Her 2010 FIG license and 2010 Worlds registration indicated that she was born in 1989. The FIG responded in October 2010 by provisionally banning North Korea from competition for one month, which effectively barred them from the 2010 World Championships. In November 2010, the FIG extended the ban until October 5, 2012, fined the North Korean Federation $20,800, and banned Hong from competing even in national competition within North Korea.\n2008 Beijing Olympics age controversy.\nDuring the 2008 Summer Olympics the age of four Chinese gymnasts – He Kexin, Jiang Yuyuan, Deng Linlin, and Yang Yilin – was brought into question, with many foreign media outlets speculating that they were underage during the Olympics. Multiple age investigations were conducted at the urging of media, as well as United States Olympic Committee executive Jim Scherr and International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge, and the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) found that the gymnasts had met the age requirements and were eligible to compete. The Chinese sports administration also acknowledged that mistakes in its paperwork have contributed to the misunderstanding."

        "text": "The 1980 PGA Championship was the 62nd PGA Championship, held August 7–10 at the East Course of Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York. Jack Nicklaus won his fifth PGA Championship, seven strokes ahead of runner-up Andy Bean. The victory tied Nicklaus with Walter Hagen, who won five PGA titles in match play competition in the 1920s.\nIt was the 17th of 18 major titles for the 40-year-old Nicklaus, and his second of the year: he won the U.S. Open two months earlier. The previous season in 1979 had been Nicklaus' worst, with no tour wins for the first time in his career. His next and final major title came nearly six years later, at the Masters in 1986.\nAfter 36 holes, Nicklaus was at 139 (−1), a stroke behind leader Gil Morgan. Nicklaus fired a 66 (−4) on Saturday to move to 205 (−5) and a three-shot lead over Lon Hinkle heading into the final round, with Morgan three more back at 211 in third. Nicklaus was as low as six-under for the round through fourteen holes, but struggled on the last four, and alternated bogeys with scrambling pars. Sunday was less eventful as Hinkle and Morgan fell back and Nicklaus carded a one-under 69 for a runaway win, uncommon for a major.\nSince changing to stroke play in 1958, the largest victory margin at the PGA Championship had been four strokes, in 1966 and 1973, the latter also won by Nicklaus. His seven stroke margin in 1980 remained the record until 2012, when Rory McIlroy won by eight.\nNicklaus became the third to win both the U.S. Open and PGA Championship in the same year, joining Gene Sarazen (1922) and Ben Hogan (1948). Tiger Woods later won both in 2000, part of his \"Tiger Slam, and Brooks Koepka also accomplished this feat in 2018.\nThis was the third major championship at the East Course, which previously hosted the U.S. Open in 1956 and 1968, when Nicklaus was the runner-up to Lee Trevino. The U.S. Open later returned in 1989 and the PGA Championship in 2003, 2013, and 2023. The course also hosted the Ryder Cup in 1995.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, August 7, 1980\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 8, 1980\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 9, 1980\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 10, 1980\""

        "title": "1958 FIFA World Cup final",
        "text": "The 1958 FIFA World Cup final took place in Råsunda Stadium, Solna (near Stockholm), Sweden, on 29 June 1958 to determine the champion of the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Brazil won the World Cup by defeating Sweden, the host country, and thus won their first World Cup title. Despite losing, the game remains Sweden’s best ever World Cup finish.\nThe 1958 final holds the record for most goals scored in a World Cup Final, and it shares the record for the greatest winning margin (with the 1970 and 1998 tournaments). The records for both the youngest and oldest goalscorer in a World Cup final were set in this match by Pelé (17 years and 249 days) and Nils Liedholm (35 years, 263 days) respectively. The final also marked several firsts: It was the first final to be disputed between a European team and a team from the Americas. Sweden became the first, and so far, only host to lose a World Cup Final (the Maracanazo of 1950 was the decisive match of the tournament, but was not a 'Final', because Sweden v Spain was played simultaneously). Their loss also meant that for the first and only time a World Cup staged in Europe was not won by a European nation.\nThe last survivor on Brazil's side was Mário Zagallo, who died on 5 January 2024 at the age of 92. Nearly a month later, the last survivor of the game, Sweden's Kurt Hamrin, died on 4 February 2024 at the age of 89.\nMatch.\nBackground.\nSince both teams wore a yellow kit as their first choice, a draw was arranged in order to decide which team would use its regular strip. Brazil boycotted the draw, thus making Sweden winner, and forcing Brazil to find another color to wear. Initially, Brazil was going to wear white, but this idea was rejected when the players were visibly frightened by the idea, recalling their loss in 1950. Eventually the staff went on to buy 22 blue T-shirts and sewed the Brazilian emblem.\nSummary.\nSweden took the lead after only 4 minutes after an excellent finish by captain Nils Liedholm. The lead did not last long, as Vavá equalised just 5 minutes later. On 32 minutes, Vavá scored a similar goal to his first to give Brazil a lead 2–1 at the break. 10 minutes into the second half, Brazil went further in front thanks to a brilliant goal scored by Pelé. He took control of the ball inside the penalty area, chipped the ball over the defender then smashed it past a helpless Kalle Svensson. Halfway through the second half Brazil went 4–1 up with a goal scored by Mário Zagallo. Simonsson pulled one back for Sweden with 10 minutes remaining but it was far too late. Pelé sealed the 5–2 victory for Brazil with a headed goal in stoppage time.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules"

        "text": "James Lewis (20 November 1987) is a Welsh rugby union player for London Welsh RFC. A centre, he previously played for Ebbw Vale, the Newport Gwent Dragons and Coventry. In 2010 he had a trial with Sale Sharks. \nThe twin brother of scrum-half Robert Lewis, James Lewis has represented Wales at U16, U18, U19, U20 and at Sevens. He scored an outstanding try in Wales U19's win over France U19's in the 2005-06 Grand Slam decider – and played a part in the newly created team's Six Nations Under 20s Championship in 2007. He has represented Wales on 18 occasions across all the age grade international teams.\nLewis was selected for the senior Wales Sevens squad at 19 years of age for the tour to the Hong Kong Sevens and the Adelaide Sevens for legs five and six of the 2006–07 IRB Sevens World Series. He scored a try in the Plate quarter-final clash against Italy in Hong Kong; his team ultimately won the trophy by overcoming Argentina in the final.\nHe was the only player to represent Wales in all of the 2007–08 IRB Sevens World Series, and the three Rugby World Cup Sevens qualifying games. He scored a try in the Bowl semi-final in the Dubai Sevens against Australia (which Wales narrowly lost), and further impressed in the George Sevens; he notched a match-winning try against France in the Bowl semi-final to put his side through to the final against England, in which he also scored to gain Wales Sevens' first piece of silverware in the 2007–08 season.\nIn 2007-08 he was Wales and Europe's highest try scorer in the IRB World Sevens Series and the 13th highest try scorer in the World 7's with 20 tries. Lewis has accumulated 34 tries for the Wales Sevens in all tournaments.\nHe was one of only 5 players (his twin brother Robert was another) who were part of the London Welsh squads that won the Greene King IPA Championship in 2011-2012 and again in 2013-2014 and he played throughout both the club's seasons in the Aviva Premiership. In season 2015 - 2016 he scored a hat-trick of tries to help London Welsh beat Yorkshire Carnegie 33 - 10 at Headingley in April to win the British &amp; Irish Cup and was awarded Man of the Match. In the final game of the season against Doncaster he made his 100th appearance for the Club.\nFollowing the unfortunate financial situation at London Welsh and its loss of a licence to continue to play in the RFU Greene King Championship, James returned to Ebbw Vale RFC in January 2017."

In the eighth inning, Wills reached base by a single. He rounded second on a short single hit by Jim Davenport to left field. Wills reached third base safely and scored on a foul out to right field moments later. This performance earned him the first All-Star Most Valuable Player Award.

        "text": "The 1990 Major League Baseball draft was held in June 1990. The draft placed amateur baseball players onto major league teams. 1,487 players were distributed to 26 teams. The draft consisted of first round selections, supplemental first round selections, compensation picks, and many more rounds, in fact, it went a record 101 rounds with 40 first round selections. With a league-worst record of 65 wins and 97 losses in the 1989 MLB Season, the Atlanta Braves selected shortstop, Chipper Jones out of the Bolles School with the first pick of the draft. Nine NBA and NFL players were drafted in 1990. Seven of the first 10 picks were selected directly out of high school.\nFirst-round selections.\nThe following are the first-round picks in the 1990 Major League Baseball draft.\nBackground.\nThe draft went a record 101 rounds, surpassing 1989's total of 88, and included a record 1,487 selections. The Astros had the most selections with a 100. Seattle followed second with 75. The 1990 draft included two Class A clubs, the Erie Sailors of the New York–Penn League and the Miami Miracle of the Florida State League. Rule 4 draft regulations permitted minor league clubs to participate. Erie made one selection, 24-year-old Brigham Young outfielder Gary Daniels. Miami made 16 selections, signing 15 of them, including All-American outfielder Paul Carey of Stanford in the fourth round. Atlanta made Chipper Jones, a high school shortstop from the Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida, the draft's top pick. Detroit followed by picking outfielder Tony Clark out of Christian High School in El Cajon, California. The top three picks and seven of the top 10 choices were out of high school.\nIn the weeks leading up to the draft, the Atlanta Braves, awarded the top selection after finishing with the league's worst record from the year before, had narrowed down their options and were still largely undecided on whom they would take. One name most frequently mentioned was Todd Van Poppel, a right-handed prep pitcher who could scrape triple-digits with his fastball. Van Poppel, however, adamantly stated that he would not sign with the club if they drafted him, and fell to 14th overall due to his massive signing bonus demands. The Braves instead chose a shortstop from Jacksonville's Bolles School named Chipper Jones, who would go on to be not just one of the greatest draft picks of all time, but one of the consensus greatest third basemen and switch-hitters in baseball history. Van Poppel, on the other hand, found very little success in the majors, and professional hitters exploited the lack of movement on his fastball and erratic command. Jones' endearing, easygoing Southern persona and remarkable consistency over his nearly 20-year career (all as a Brave) earned him a first ballot Hall of Fame selection.\nOther notable players.\n† All-Star \n‡ Hall of Fame"

It was Grady's second and final win on the PGA Tour.\nConcerns about racial discrimination in the club's membership caused many sponsors to pull their network television advertising, including IBM. This was the final year that ABC carried the broadcast, replaced by CBS in 1991.\nControversy.\nLeading up to the tournament, Shoal Creek founder Hall Thompson doubled down on the club's policy of excluding African-Americans from membership.

It was also the first Survivor Series PPV broadcast in high definition.\nThe main event was for the World Heavyweight Championship between John Cena, returning after suffering a herniated disc at SummerSlam, and the champion, Chris Jericho, which Cena won by pinfall after executing a FU. Another match on the event was the SmackDown main event, which saw Edge return and defeat Vladimir Kozlov, and the champion Triple H, in a Triple Threat match to win the WWE Championship. The undercard matches included The Undertaker versus The Big Show in a Casket Match and three five-on-five elimination tag team matches.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2008 event was the 22nd event in the Survivor Series chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. The event was scheduled to be held on November 23, 2008, at the TD Banknorth Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. It was the first Survivor Series PPV broadcast in high definition.\nStorylines.\nThe event featured professional wrestling matches involving wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed heroes or villains as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", and \"ECW\".\nAdvertising on WWE programming and on the Survivor Series promotional poster had foreshadowed the return of John Cena, whom a herniated disk injury (that he suffered during his match with Batista at SummerSlam) had sidelined, at the event. On the November 3, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Shane McMahon announced that Cena would challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. Cena would face the champion resulting from a Steel cage match between World Heavyweight Champion Batista and Chris Jericho, which Jericho won to become the new World Heavyweight Champion, setting up his match with Cena at Survivor Series.\nThe main feud on the SmackDown brand involved Triple H, Vladimir Kozlov and Jeff Hardy, who were competing for Triple H's WWE Championship. At No Mercy in October, Hardy came close to winning the WWE title from Triple H but failed to do so when Triple H pinned him with the roll-up. Kozlov was one of the choices for Triple H's challengers at Cyber Sunday for the fans to vote, but Hardy won the poll and faced Triple H for the title, a match in which Hardy lost again. Then, after Kozlov demanded a WWE title match against Triple H on \"SmackDown\", General manager Vickie Guerrero put Kozlov in a match against The Undertaker on the November 7 episode of \"SmackDown\", adding that if Kozlov won, he would challenge Triple H at Survivor Series for the WWE Championship. Kozlov won the match, albeit via disqualification after Hardy interfered and hit Kozlov with a steel chair. However, after seeing Hardy defeat The Undertaker in an Extreme Rules match the following week, Guerrero scheduled Hardy in a non-title match against Triple H on the November 21 episode of \"SmackDown\", stating that should Hardy win, she would add him to the WWE Championship match at Survivor Series, making it a Triple Threat match. Hardy won the match and earned the title opportunity. However, it was announced during the event that Hardy was found unconscious in a hotel stairwell in Boston, casting doubt over whether he would be able to compete in the match.\nAnother feud from \"SmackDown\" heading into Survivor Series took place between The Undertaker and The Big Show. At Unforgiven, Big Show betrayed The Undertaker and attacked him, punching him in the head on several occasions. At No Mercy, in a match between the two, Big Show knocked The Undertaker out with two punches to the face and one to the back of the head, prompting the referee to rule the match a knockout in Big Show's favour. However, at Cyber Sunday, when the fans voted for a Last Man Standing match, Undertaker defeated Big Show by choking him out with the Hell's Gate. On an episode of \"SmackDown\", The Undertaker defeated Chavo Guerrero in a casket match despite the Big Show's interference. On the November 7 episode, Big Show challenged Undertaker to a casket match at Survivor Series.\nThree inter-promotional Survivor Series Elimination matches were scheduled for the event. In one match, Shawn Michaels captained the team of Rey Mysterio, The Great Khali, and Cryme Tyme (JTG and Shad Gaspard) against John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and his team of Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), Kane, John Morrison and The Miz. The feud that led to the Team HBK vs. Team JBL match began between Rey Mysterio and Kane over the summer then a couple of months later, the Team of Cryme Tyme (from the Raw brand) started their own feud against John Morrison and The Miz (from the ECW brand). From SmackDown, MVP and The Great Khali have had their own issues in the few weeks leading up to Survivor Series. The main rivalry between the captains, Michaels and JBL, began on the October 27 episode of \"Raw\", when JBL attacked Michaels before a tag-team match between the latter and Batista, taking on JBL and Chris Jericho. Despite the assault, Michaels and Batista defeated JBL and Jericho. The next week, a match between JBL and The Undertaker took place, which Undertaker won by countout. Moments after the match, Michaels threw JBL back into the ring, allowing Undertaker to perform a Tombstone Piledriver on JBL. On the November 10 episode, JBL retaliated when he helped Chris Jericho defeat Michaels in a Last Man Standing match.\nAnother match featured Batista captaining the team of Matt Hardy, R-Truth, CM Punk, and Kofi Kingston, and facing off against the team captained by Randy Orton, consisting of Shelton Benjamin, William Regal, Cody Rhodes, and Mark Henry. The rivalry between the captains, Batista and Orton began on the November 10 episode of \"Raw\", when Batista invoked his rematch clause against Chris Jericho, whom he lost the World title the week before in a Steel cage match. Stephanie McMahon, however, appeared in the titantron to address Batista, alerting him that due to her brother, Shane's promise that whoever won the Steel cage match would go on to face John Cena for the title at Survivor Series, she was unable to grant Batista his rematch request until after the pay-per-view event. Following this, Orton made his way to the ring, dredging up bad history from he and Batista's days in Evolution several years earlier. Orton then said that after Cena, it was his turn for a title opportunity, not Batista's. On the November 17 episode of \"Raw\", Orton defeated Punk in a Lumberjack match with the help of then WWE Intercontinental Champion, William Regal. After the match, Batista entered the ring and attacked Orton, leading all of the superstars present to get involved in what became an out-of-control brawl that ended the show.\nThe third match announced was a Divas Elimination match, in which Beth Phoenix led Team Raw composed of Mickie James, Candice Michelle, Kelly Kelly, and Jillian Hall, against Team SmackDown, which featured Michelle McCool as captain, Victoria, Maria, Maryse, and Natalya. On the October 3 episode of \"SmackDown\", Women's Champion Phoenix defeated the Divas Champion McCool in a Lumberjill match due to interference from Maryse. The feud between Phoenix and McCool restarted on the November 17 episode of \"Raw\", when Raw Diva, Kelly Kelly fought SmackDown Diva Victoria and was victorious. As a result of this, Victoria attacked her opponent after the bell before Kelly's fellow Raw Divas ran to her rescue.\nEvent.\nBefore Survivor Series aired on pay-per-view, The Brian Kendrick defeated Kung Fu Naki in an untelevised match.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with a Survivor Series elimination match between Team HBK (Shawn Michaels, Rey Mysterio, Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG) and The Great Khali) and Team JBL (John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), Kane, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), John Morrison and The Miz). 7 minutes into the match; the first four eliminations of JTG, MVP, Kane and Gaspard took place. JBL, The Miz and Morrison dominated Michaels where JBL bruised Michaels' eye. Morrison taunted Michaels using the latter's techniques but couldn't execute them properly . Michaels made a desperate tag to Rey Mysterio who after a flurry of offense connected with \"619\" and a splash on Miz and eliminated him. Later on, JBL and Morrison dominated Rey Mysterio who after a Moonsault on JBL tagged in Michaels. Michaels and JBL took the fight outside the ring and Michaels made it before the 10-count. JBL was eliminated via countout. Morrison tried to do the Sweet Chin Music on Michaels but Michaels countered with one of his own to eliminate Morrison and bring the victory to his team. Khali, Mysterio and Michaels were the survivors.\nThe second match was a Divas Survivor Series elimination match between Team Raw (Beth Phoenix, Mickie James, Kelly Kelly, Candice Michelle and Jillian Hall) and Team SmackDown (Michelle McCool, Victoria, Maria, Maryse and Natalya). Victoria was eliminated by Kelly Kelly with a Rana pin. Kelly Kelly was eliminated by Maryse after a Side Slam Backbreaker. McCool was eliminated by Mickie after a Mickie-DDT. James was eliminated by Maryse with a roll-up. Natalya was eliminated by Candice after a Spear. Hall was eliminated by Maria with a victory roll. Maria was eliminated by Candice with a Bridging Northern Light Suplex pin. Candice was eliminated by Maryse after submitting to a modified Figure Four Leglock. Maryse was eliminated by Phoenix after a Glam Slam, leaving Phoenix as the sole survivor.\nNext, The Undertaker faced Big Show in a Casket Match. During the match, Undertaker executed a Leg Drop through a broadcast table on Big Show. Big Show performed a Chokeslam on Undertaker and tried to walk away but Undertaker stopped him. The two fought on the entrance ramp, where Big Show set up the casket. The match ended when Undertaker performed an Irish Whip on Big Show, knocking him into a casket. As the casket fell over, Undertaker won the match.\nThe fourth match was a Survivor Series elimination match between Team Orton (Randy Orton, Shelton Benjamin, William Regal, Cody Rhodes and Mark Henry) and Team Batista (Batista, CM Punk, Kofi Kingston, Matt Hardy, and R-Truth). Regal was eliminated by Punk after a GTS. R-Truth was eliminated by Benjamin after a Paydirt. Kingston was eliminated by Orton after a Rope-Hung DDT. Punk was eliminated by Rhodes after a Silver Spoon DDT. Hardy was eliminated by Henry after a World's Strongest Slam. Henry was eliminated by Batista after a Spear. Benjamin was eliminated by Batista after a Batista Bomb. Batista was eliminated by Orton after an RKO, leaving Orton and Rhodes as the survivors.\nMain event matches.\nThe first main event match began as a standard match for the WWE Championship between Triple H and Vladimir Kozlov. After Triple H executed a Pedigree on Kozlov, Vickie Guerrero changed the match into a Triple threat match also involving Edge, marking Edge's first appearance since SummerSlam. Edge performed a Spear on Triple H but was attacked by Jeff Hardy, who was originally scheduled to be in the match. Hardy tried to hit Edge with a chair but hit Triple H instead. Hardy then also hit Kozlov with the chair but Edge performed a Spear on Hardy. Edge pinned Triple H to win the title. This was the first time that the WWE Championship changed hands in the PG Era.\nIn the final match, Chris Jericho defended the World Heavyweight Championship against John Cena, who returned from injury after suffering a herniated disc at SummerSlam. During the match, Cena attempted a Five Knuckle Shuffle on Jericho but Jericho applied the Liontamer on Cena, which he countered. Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho but Cena reached the ropes to break the hold. Cena performed an FU on Jericho for a near-fall. Cena attempted another FU on Jericho but Jericho countered with a Codebreaker for a near-fall. Cena applied the STF on Jericho but Jericho countered with a small package for a near-fall. Cena performed another FU on Jericho to win the title.\nReception.\nThe event was voted by \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" as the worst pay-per-view of 2008; the WWE Championship match was voted as the worst match of 2008; and Jeff Hardy's hotel room unconsciousness, used as the kayfabe reason for his removal from said WWE Championship match was voted as that year's Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic.\nThe event received 319,000 pay per view buys, down from 341,000 the previous year, which contributed to a decline of $4 million in pay-per-view revenue for WWE in the fourth quarter of 2008.\nAftermath.\nAfter Edge returned and captured the WWE Championship, Triple H, Jeff Hardy, and Vladimir Kozlov participated in a Beat The Clock challenge for the number one contender's spot. Kozlov lost his match to Matt Hardy, while Jeff Hardy and Triple H each won their matches in exactly the same time. Due to the results, a reluctant Vickie Guerrero scheduled Edge to defend his WWE Championship against both Hardy and Triple H in a triple threat match at Armageddon. At the pay-per-view, Hardy defeated Edge and Triple H to win his first WWE Championship. The situation with Jeff Hardy was tied into the lead up to his match at WrestleMania 25 against his brother Matt Hardy, who claimed responsibility for attacking him.\nThe feud between John Cena and Chris Jericho continued on into Armageddon, where Cena defeated Jericho to retain the World Heavyweight Championship.\nThe day after Survivor Series, Melina returned from injury and resumed her feud with Beth Phoenix that had begun back in June. On the December 29 episode of \"Raw\", Melina won a battle royal to become the number one contender to Phoenix's WWE Women's Championship. At the Royal Rumble, Melina defeated Phoenix to win her third Women's Championship. After the SmackDown Divas were defeated at Survivor Series, Michelle McCool began turning heel when she attacked Maria after losing a non-title match to her on the December 5 episode of \"SmackDown\". Two weeks later, Maryse defeated Maria to earn a shot at Michelle's WWE Divas Championship. On the December 26 episode of \"SmackDown\", Maryse defeated Michelle to capture the Divas Championship in a match where Maria was the guest referee."

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1962 followed a new system for even-number years. Since 1956 the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) and Veterans Committee had alternated in their duties, but the BBWAA, voting by mail to select from recent major league players, had elected no one for 1958 and no one for 1960. Now there would be a second, \"runoff\" election in case of no winner. At the same time, the Veterans Committee resumed meeting annually to consider executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players.\nThe provision for a runoff was not necessary for this election, as the writers elected two new candidates on their first ballot, Bob Feller and Jackie Robinson. The Veterans Committee selected Bill McKechnie and Edd Roush, both of whom were still alive to be interviewed and invited to the induction ceremonies. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 23, 1962, with Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1932 or later, but not after 1956. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast their votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 1962 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 23. A total of 78 players received votes; 160 ballots were cast, with 120 votes required for election. A total of 1,090 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.81 per ballot—the first election to average fewer than 8 votes per ballot, and a record low which would stand until 1987 (6.61 votes per ballot).\nEligible for the final time were: Sam Rice, Eppa Rixey, Burleigh Grimes, Hack Wilson, Kiki Cuyler, Red Faber, Jim Bottomley, Lefty Gomez, Waite Hoyt, Heinie Manush, Goose Goslin, Lefty O'Doul, Tony Lazzeri, Chick Hafey, Freddie Lindstrom, Earle Combs, Jimmie Dykes, Jimmie Wilson, Earl Averill, Jesse Haines, Charlie Grimm, Firpo Marberry, Wes Ferrell, Freddie Fitzsimmons, Travis Jackson, George Kelly, Red Rolfe, Luke Sewell, Riggs Stephenson and Glenn Wright.\nMany of the above candidates would lose eligibility before the 1964 election due to a rule change affecting the retirement qualifications of those voted on by the BBWAA. While the BBWAA had previously been able to consider those who had been retired between 5 and 30 seasons, after this election the BBWAA were to consider those who had been retired between 5 and 20 seasons. Among the candidates who were affected by this rule change and would not appear on the 1964 BBWAA ballot, the top two vote receivers (Sam Rice and Eppa Rixey) were elected by the Veterans Committee in 1963.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated with a dagger (†)."

        "title": "England at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The England national football team did not enter the first three FIFA World Cup tournaments but have entered all 19 subsequent ones, beginning with that of 1950. They have failed to qualify for the finals on three occasions – 1974 (West Germany), 1978 (Argentina) and 1994 (United States) – and have failed to advance from the group stage on three occasions: in 1950, 1958 and 2014. Their best performance is winning the cup as the host nation in 1966; they also finished in fourth place in 1990 in Italy, and in 2018 in Russia. Other than these, the team have also reached the quarter-finals on seven other occasions, the latest of which was in 2022 in Qatar.\nHistory.\nBrazil 1950.\nEngland's first qualifying campaign for the FIFA World Cup doubled as the 1950 British Home Championship. The series began for England on 15 October 1949 at Ninian Park, Cardiff, against Wales. Stan Mortensen gave England the lead after 22 minutes, and seven minutes later Jackie Milburn doubled the lead. This was the first goal of Milburn's hat trick, which left England 4–0 up with 20 minutes to play. Mal Griffiths scored a consolation goal for Wales ten minutes from time, but England held on for a comfortable victory.\nA month later, England welcomed Ireland to Maine Road, and it began well for the home side as Jack Rowley scored inside six minutes. England were already 6–0 up, thanks to Jack Froggatt, two for Stan Pearson, Mortensen and a second from Rowley, by the time Ireland struck back through Samuel Smyth after 55 minutes. Rowley added two more goals to his tally in the three minutes following Smyth's goal, leaving the score at 8–1 after an hour. The match ended 9–2, with Pearson scoring England's ninth, and Bobby Brennan scoring for Ireland.\nIn May 1950, England travelled to Hampden Park to face Scotland, who were also undefeated after their games against Ireland and Wales. With the top two from the group qualifying, both teams were guaranteed progression to the finals, and the game was solely for the honour of winning the British Home Championship, and the seeding advantage to be enjoyed upon reaching Brazil. A goal from Roy Bentley gave England the victory and top spot in the group.\nEngland were seeded for the finals, which meant they were the favourites to progress from Group 2, which also contained Spain, Chile and the United States. They began against Chile in Rio de Janeiro and won 2–0, with goals from Mortensen and Wilf Mannion.\nTheir troubles began four days later when they faced the Americans in Belo Horizonte, as Joe Gaetjens scored the only goal of the match to give the United States an unlikely victory, which has gone down as one of the World Cup's greatest upsets. A myth arose that the English newspapers were so confident of an English victory that when the result was telegrammed back, they assumed a misprint and printed the score as 10–1 in England's favour. However, this has proven to be untrue.\nThis left England needing to beat Spain in Rio to stand any chance of qualifying. Spain's Zarra scored the only goal of the game, eliminating England from the competition.\nSwitzerland 1954.\nEngland's qualifying group for the 1954 edition also constituted the 1953–54 British Home Championship. They played Wales at Ninian Park as their first match once again, and the 4–1 result was the same as four years earlier. Ivor Allchurch gave the home side a half-time lead, but England scored four within eight minutes of the restart with two each for Dennis Wilshaw and Nat Lofthouse.\nAt Goodison Park against Northern Ireland, Harold Hassall scored for England after ten minutes, and although Eddie McMorran equalised just before the hour mark, further goals from Hassall and Lofthouse completed a comfortable 3–1 win for England.\nWith the top two in the group qualifying for the finals, the final game between England and Scotland, at Hampden Park, settled nothing except the placings within the group, despite Scotland having dropped a point with a 3–3 draw at home to Wales. Allan Brown put the home side ahead after just seven minutes, but it was all square again thanks to Ivor Broadis just four minutes later. Johnny Nicholls gave England the lead for the first time just after half time, and they extended the lead with Ronnie Allen's 68th-minute goal. Jimmy Mullen added a fourth seven minutes from time, and although Willie Ormond scored a consolation for Scotland, England topped the competition for the second time in a row.\nEngland were drawn in Group 4 for the finals, with Switzerland, Italy and Belgium. In an odd twist, unique to the 1954 tournament, England and Italy, as the two seeded teams in the group, did not have to play each other.\nEngland's first game in Switzerland was against Belgium in Basel, and they suffered a shock as Pol Anoul put the Belgians into the lead after just five minutes. Two goals from Broadis and one from Lofthouse gave England a 3–1 lead just after the hour, but Henri Coppens hit back four minutes later before Anoul levelled the scores again. Drawn matches in the group stage went to extra time, and in the added period Lofthouse added a fourth for England, but Jimmy Dickinson scored an own goal three minutes later to leave the final score at 4–4.\nEngland's second group game was against the hosts Switzerland in Bern. This proved to be an easier game for the Three Lions, and they scored one goal in each half, from Mullen and Wilshaw, to give them a comfortable 2–0 win. England progressed as group winners, along with Switzerland, who won a play-off against Italy.\nEngland faced the defending champions Uruguay, the winners of Group 3, in the quarter-finals. Carlos Borges gave the South Americans the lead inside five minutes, but Lofthouse put England back on terms ten minutes later. Obdulio Varela and Juan Alberto Schiaffino scored further goals for Uruguay, but Tom Finney made the score 3–2 in the 67th minute. However, Javier Ambrois restored the two-goal lead with twelve minutes to play and England were eliminated after losing 4–2.\nSweden 1958.\nFor the first time, England had to play against countries other than the Home Nations to reach the Finals in Sweden. They were drawn against the Republic of Ireland and Denmark. In the qualifying round, England won three out of the four games and drew the other. Four months before the World Cup, Manchester United players Roger Byrne, Duncan Edwards, David Pegg and Tommy Taylor all died as a result of the Munich air disaster. At the finals, which is the only tournament to have seen all Home Nations take part, the Home Nations were all drawn in different groups.\nEngland were drawn against the Soviet Union (2–2), Brazil (0–0) and Austria (2–2), who finished third in the 1954 World Cup. At the end of the group stage, Soviet Union and England each had three points, and had scored four goals and conceded four goals. This meant there was a play-off to decide the second-placed team in the group, the winner to qualify. England lost the play-off 1–0 and were thus knocked out. The only consolation for England was that they were the only team to play the eventual winners Brazil and not lose.\nChile 1962.\nThe third World Cup which took place in South America, saw England qualify from the group, which contained Portugal and Luxembourg, defeating Luxembourg on both occasions, and defeating Portugal at home, and drawing in Lisbon.\nAt the finals, England were drawn in a group with Hungary, Argentina and Bulgaria. England defeated Argentina 3–1, thanks to goals from Ron Flowers, Bobby Charlton and Jimmy Greaves, before playing out a goalless draw with Bulgaria, and a 2–1 defeat to Hungary.\nEngland finished in second place behind Hungary and played the winners of group 3, defending champions Brazil, in the quarter-finals. Brazil scored first through Garrincha, before an equaliser for Gerry Hitchens before half time. However, second-half goals from Garrincha and Vavá meant Brazil won the game 3–1, and eliminated England from the competition. This defeat was manager Walter Winterbottom's last game in charge. Winterbottom had led England to four World Cup Finals. From May 1963, Alf Ramsey became the manager of England.\nEngland 1966.\nIn the 1966 World Cup Finals, England used their home advantage and, under Ramsey, won their first, and only, World Cup title. England played all their games at Wembley Stadium in London, which became the last time that the hosts were granted this privilege. England did not concede a goal in any of their first four matches at the tournament, starting with a 0–0 draw in the opening game against former champions Uruguay, followed by 2–0 wins over France and Mexico to see them finish top of their group and qualify for the quarter-finals.\nThere they faced Argentina, in a very fierce game that saw Argentinian Antonio Rattín sent off by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein. Geoff Hurst scored the only goal of the game, and only his second in international football, to give England the win and a place in the semi-finals, where they faced Portugal. Two goals from Bobby Charlton gave England the lead going into the final 10 minutes of the match, before Eusebio scored from the penalty spot in the 82nd minute, the first goal England had conceded in the tournament. The final pitted England against West Germany, who took the lead in the 12th minute through Helmut Haller. Hurst equalised six minutes later, before Martin Peters gave England the lead with 12 minutes left to play; however, in the 89th minute, Wolfgang Weber levelled the scores again to take the match to extra time. In the additional period, Hurst scored twice more, the first crashing down off the crossbar before being given by linesman Tofiq Bahramov, who controversially deemed the ball to have entirely crossed the line. Hurst's three goals made him the first player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup final, a feat that was only matched in the 2022 final by Kylian Mbappé.\nMexico 1970.\n1970 saw the first World Cup finals take place in North America and England qualified automatically for the tournament by winning the 1966 FIFA World Cup. England were drawn in a group with Romania, former world champions Brazil and Czechoslovakia. Each of the matches only saw one goal, with England defeating Romania and Czechoslovakia, and losing to Brazil, progressing them to the quarter-final second in their group. The quarter-final saw a repeat of the 1966 final, with England playing West Germany. England were hampered by the fact that first-choice goalkeeper Gordon Banks was ill, and Peter Bonetti played instead. England led 2–0 with goals by Alan Mullery and Martin Peters, but in the 70th minute, Franz Beckenbauer pulled one goal back for West Germany.\nAfter Beckenbauer's goal, Ramsey substituted Bobby Charlton, who overtook Billy Wright as England's most capped player ever, with caps totalling 106. Uwe Seeler equalised for the Germans in the 81st minute, thereby taking the game into extra time. During extra time, Gerd Müller scored the winning goal for West Germany which saw the German side win 3–2. This turned out to be Charlton's last game for England.\nWest Germany 1974.\nFor the first time, England did not qualify for a World Cup. In a group with Olympic champions Poland and Wales, England could not overtake Poland. After only drawing at home to Wales 1–1 and losing 2–0 in Poland, England had to beat Poland at home, whilst Poland only needed to draw. Poland managed to withstand England's attacks in the first half. Poland took the lead in the 57th minute with a goal from Jan Domarski.\nEngland equalised six minutes later, with a penalty converted by Allan Clarke. England were unable to score any more goals with goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski keeping England at bay. Brian Clough had previously called Tomaszewski a \"clown\". The commentator of the game then said \"it's all over\". Poland took this good form to the finals and ended in third place. After failing to qualify, Alf Ramsey resigned from his post and after a time, where Ramsey and his predecessor had lasted a total of 29 years, no manager was able to last in the job for longer than eight years. This ended when Bobby Robson became England manager.\nArgentina 1978.\nEngland also did not qualify for the fourth World Cup which took place in South America. This time, England were denied by Italy, who had scored three more goals than England after both teams finished on the same points. Goals scored dictated who qualified after the head-to-head record between the two sides finished the same, following a 2–0 home win for each team. The lower-ranked teams in the group were Finland and Luxembourg, but the size of the wins against them proved to be decisive. Nevertheless, Ron Greenwood was given a second chance in charge of England, after taking the role in 1977.\nSpain 1982.\n1982 saw the first time where the European Qualifying Rounds were divided into groups of five teams, where the top two teams qualify for the World Cup. Greenwood used his second chance and took England to Spain by finishing second behind Hungary and above Romania, Switzerland and Norway.\nAt the finals, England won all three group games for the first time, defeating France 3–1, with a brace from Bryan Robson, before beating Czechoslovakia 2–0, with a Jozef Barmos own goal, and World Cup newcomers Kuwait 1–0, thanks to a Trevor Francis goal.\nThe next round saw a second group stage consisting of three teams, a first-time event at the World Cup. England drew with West Germany 0–0 and after the Germans beat Spain 2–1, England then had to beat Spain with a two-goal difference to progress to the next round. England, however, only managed a 0–0 draw against the Spanish. England remained unbeaten at the end of the tournament. After the World Cup, Ron Greenwood's time as England manager ended, and he was replaced by Bobby Robson.\nMexico 1986.\n1986 saw the second World Cup to take place in Mexico. England qualified by winning four games and drawing four times in their group matches against Northern Ireland, who qualified in second place, Romania, Finland and Turkey.\nIn Mexico, England lost their opening game to Portugal 1–0 and could only manage a goalless draw against Morocco, when Ray Wilkins was sent off. The final group game, however, saw England beat Poland 3–0, with Gary Lineker scoring a hat-trick. This result took England to second place, behind Morocco.\nEngland then also beat Paraguay 3–0 in the round of 16. In the quarter-finals, England renewed their rivalry with Argentina in a game that has become notorious for the Argentina goals, both scored by Diego Maradona. Maradona's first goal, known as the Hand of God, was illegal as he used his hand to punch the ball into the net. However, the referee missed this infringement and ruled that the goal should stand. Maradona then made the score 2–0, famously dribbling from inside Argentina's half and around several English players before scoring. Lineker pulled back the score to 2–1, but England were unable to equalise and were eliminated. Nevertheless, Lineker finished with the Golden Boot by scoring six goals and thereby becoming England's first Golden Boot winner.\nItaly 1990.\nBy winning three and drawing three, England qualified for Italia '90, the second World Cup to be held in Italy, scoring ten goals and conceding none. Although unbeaten through qualification, England still finished second to Sweden, whom they drew with twice. England profited from Romania's 3–1 win over Denmark, who, had they won, would have qualified as the third-best second-placed team. West Germany and England were able to qualify for Italia '90 as the best second-placed teams in the groups with four teams.\nBecause of the rise of hooliganism among English fans at matches in European competition, England's group games were scheduled to be played on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. Joining them in group F were European champions Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Egypt. After opening the tournament with a 1–1 draw against Ireland and a 0–0 draw against the Dutch, England then beat Egypt 1–0. This was Egypt's first appearance since the 1934 World Cup. England won the group with four points.\nIn the next round, England had to play Belgium. The game went to extra time, and in the 119th minute, David Platt scored the winning goal. England also had to play extra time against Cameroon in the quarter-finals. Cameroon were the first African team to have reached the quarter-finals. England opened the scoring through David Platt, but Cameroon quickly turned around the game to lead 2–1. Lineker subsequently won and scored a penalty in the 83rd minute to ensure the game went to extra time. He then scored a second penalty, to see England reach the semi-finals.\nIn the semi-finals, England met West Germany. There was no separating the two teams after 90 minutes, which made England the first team to have played extra time in three successive World Cup games. There was also no separating the two teams after extra time, thereby taking the game to penalties.\nAlthough English goalkeeper Peter Shilton dived the right way for every penalty, he was unable to save any. German goalkeeper Bodo Illgner, having failed to save any of England's first three penalties, saved England's fourth penalty, taken by Stuart Pearce. Olaf Thon then scored for Germany, meaning that England's Chris Waddle would have to score his fifth penalty and hope that Shilton saved the Germans' fifth penalty. However, Waddle's penalty missed completely, going high over the crossbar, thereby resulting in England's being knocked out of the competition. The third-place playoff between England and Italy saw England lose their only game of the tournament in normal time. Even though this was England's best finish since the 1966 World Cup, Bobby Robson's time as England manager had come to an end.\nUnited States 1994.\nFor the 1994 World Cup in the United States, under the leadership of new manager Graham Taylor, England surprisingly did not qualify for the tournament. In a group with six teams, England lost to Norway and the Netherlands, finishing third above Poland, Turkey and San Marino.\nEngland went into their final game with San Marino knowing they would need a seven-goal victory and for Poland to beat the Netherlands in the other match in order to qualify. In the game against San Marino, Davide Gualtieri scored against England after nine seconds, taking the lead for the outsiders. England went on to win 7–1, which was too small a goal margin. Additionally, despite the half-time score between the Poles and the Dutch being 1–1, the Dutch went on to win 3–1, meaning that however many goals England scored, they could still not qualify. Taylor's tenure in charge ended and he was replaced by Terry Venables, who left after England lost the semi-final of Euro 1996, hosted in England.\nFrance 1998.\nAfter missing out on the World Cup in 1994, England, managed by Glenn Hoddle, qualified for the World Cup in France. England were drawn in Group 2 of UEFA qualifying with Italy, Poland, Georgia and Moldova. England beat Poland, Georgia and Moldova both home and away, but a home defeat to Italy in their fourth match meant they went into the final qualifier at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome just a point ahead of the \"Azzurri\" and only needing a draw to qualify automatically; defeat would see them have to navigate a play-off to secure qualification. The match finished as a goalless draw and England finished top of the group.\nAt the finals in France, England played in Group G. England defeated Tunisia 2–0 in the first game, with goals from Alan Shearer and Paul Scholes. Their second match saw England lose 2–1 to Romania; despite an 81st-minute equaliser from Michael Owen, Dan Petrescu scored a winner shortly before injury time. In their final group game, England defeated Colombia 2–0 in the decisive match, thanks to goals from midfielders Darren Anderton and David Beckham. England finished second in Group G, which saw them qualify for the last 16 phase, and play the winner of 1998 FIFA World Cup Group H, Argentina.\nIn a fiery game containing six yellow cards and two penalties, David Beckham was controversially sent off in the 47th minute for what many felt was at most a yellow card offence, knocking over Diego Simeone. Gabriel Batistuta opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the fifth minute of the game, before an equaliser also from the spot by Alan Shearer four minutes later. England took the lead through Owen, in the 16th minute. Argentina drew level through Javier Zanetti in injury time of the first half.\nThe game finished 2–2, and, as neither team were able to find a winner in extra time, penalties were needed to decide the team that qualified to the next round. While David Seaman did save one penalty, Argentine goalkeeper Carlos Roa managed to save two, including the vital one from David Batty, thereby knocking England out of the World Cup. Beckham subsequently received death threats and was sent bullets in the post.\nSouth Korea/Japan 2002.\nIn 2002 the World Cup took place in Asia for the first time. England, under its first ever foreign manager in Swedish Sven-Göran Eriksson, were able to qualify for the tournament. England were drawn in Group 9, alongside Germany, Finland, Greece and Albania. In the last ever game in the original Wembley Stadium, (which closed after the match) England played Germany, losing 1–0, the only goal scored by Dietmar Hamann. The match was the last under the management of Kevin Keegan, who resigned at the end of the match, and was replaced by Eriksson. By beating Germany 5–1 in Munich, England's qualifying campaign was revitalised, and they qualified automatically, by drawing 2–2 with Greece. Germany, who could only draw 0–0 with Finland, had to play a play-off game against Ukraine, with England qualifying ahead winning the group.\nIn Japan, England had to play against Eriksson's homeland, Sweden, and both settled out for a 1–1 draw. England and Beckham gained a measure of revenge for their previous 1998 defeat in defeating Argentina 1–0, thanks to a Beckham penalty. However, England could only manage a disappointing 0–0 draw against Nigeria, meaning that although they were able to qualify for the second round, where they were to play Denmark, they had qualified as runners up. This meant that they were destined to meet favourites Brazil in the quarter-finals if they progressed.\nEngland played Denmark in the round of 16 defeating Denmark 3–0, thanks to goals from Michael Owen, Rio Ferdinand, and Emile Heskey. England played four-time World Cup winners and 1998 runners-up Brazil in the quarter-finals. Despite leading through a Michael Owen goal, a mistake by David Seaman saw England lose 2–1, and Brazil won their fourth World Cup match against England, and went on to win the tournament.\nEngland are the worst football team in the worlds top ten.\nEngland were drawn into Group 6 of European qualifying for the 2006 World Cup. The group featured other home nations in Wales, and Northern Ireland, as well as Poland (who had eliminated England the last time the World Cup took place in Germany), Azerbaijan and Austria. England won eight of the 10 games, and qualified as group winners, in front of Poland, despite drawing to Austria in Vienna, and losing to Northern Ireland in Belfast.\nIn Germany, however, England were less convincing. England played in Group B, alongside Paraguay, Trinidad and Tobago, and Sweden. England started with a 1–0 win against Paraguay; which was won thanks to a third-minute own goal. The second game against first time qualifiers Trinidad and Tobago saw England have to wait until the 83rd minute to take the lead, when Peter Crouch opened the scoring with a goal many felt was illegal, and the second goal of the game coming in added time from Steven Gerrard. The last group game saw England play against Sweden, where an eventual 2–2 draw saw them qualify for the next round as group winners, thereby avoiding playing hosts Germany.\nIn the last 16 stage, a free kick from David Beckham gave England a 1–0 win against Ecuador and reach the quarter-finals, where they faced Portugal. The game finished goalless after Wayne Rooney was sent off, and England once again were knocked out on penalties and Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo became the first goalkeeper to save three penalties in a penalty shoot-out. Ricardo saved from Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher; the only England player to convert his penalty was Owen Hargreaves. Portugal won the shoot-out 3–1, despite misses from Petit and Hugo Viana. This game was also Eriksson's final match as England manager.\nSouth Africa 2010.\nQualification for the first African World Cup went successfully for new England manager Fabio Capello, after previous manager Steve McClaren was unable to secure qualification to the Euro 2008. By winning nine times and losing only to Ukraine, England qualified ahead of Croatia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Andorra. England's group was seen as a favourable one, containing comparatively much weaker teams. However, England opened the tournament with a 1–1 draw against the United States, thanks to a major error by goalkeeper Robert Green. They then drew 0–0 against Algeria and were booed off the field by their own fans, drawing the ire of striker Wayne Rooney. England eventually qualified for the next round by beating Slovenia 1–0, but only as runners up to the United States, thereby meaning they would be drawn against favourites Germany.\nIn the second round match, Germany took the lead after 20 minutes after goalkeeper Manuel Neuer played the ball down the pitch to Miroslav Klose, who opened the scoring. The score became 2–0 to Germany after 32 minutes. Shortly after, England defender Matthew Upson scored a header. Later, Frank Lampard had a shot at goal disallowed despite having been shown to cross the line. This was confirmed on replays. Neuer subsequently admitted he knew the ball had crossed the line, but had decided to deceive the referee. The German media reported it was \"revenge for Wembley\", while the English media criticised FIFA's refusal to implement goal-line technology. Ironically, despite this earlier opposition to new goal-line technology, Sepp Blatter later said that it should be introduced after a Ukrainian goal against England at UEFA Euro 2012 had been ruled out. As England tried to equalise, Germany used this to their advantage and scored two more goals. England's 4–1 defeat was their heaviest in the World Cup finals.\nBrazil 2014.\nUnder Roy Hodgson, who had replaced Fabio Capello before Euro 2012 after a disagreement between Capello and The FA, England qualified for the second World Cup to be held in Brazil. Ukraine were again one of the opponents in the qualifying rounds. The other opponents included Montenegro, Poland, Moldova and San Marino. After winning six games and drawing four, England qualified unbeaten.\nThe draw for the finals pitched England against Italy and Uruguay, both former world champions, which meant that it was the first time three previous winners were drawn in the same group, along with Costa Rica. England lost to Italy and Uruguay, and were knocked out after two games because Costa Rica pulled a shocking upset on both Uruguay and Italy. The final match against Costa Rica finished as a goalless draw. Their tally of one point from three matches was their lowest total in the group stage of a World Cup.\nRussia 2018.\nEngland played in UEFA Group F in qualification for the 2018 World Cup, in a group of six with Slovakia, Slovenia, Scotland, Lithuania and Malta, with only the winner of the group guaranteed qualification. England went into the qualification process under manager Sam Allardyce, only for Allardyce to leave the post after just one game due to controversy regarding discussing breaking FIFA rules.\nUnder Allardyce's replacement, Gareth Southgate, England went undefeated throughout qualification, winning eight matches out of 10, drawing with Slovenia 0–0 in Ljubljana, and drawing 2–2 with Scotland in Glasgow thanks to a 90th-minute equaliser from Harry Kane. This was the third successive major tournament for which England qualified undefeated.\nEngland began in group G against Tunisia. The game started well for England with a goal from Harry Kane in the 11th minute. Tunisia equalised through Sassi from the penalty spot in the 35th minute following a foul by Kyle Walker. Some controversy followed as various potential offences against Kane inside the penalty area were ignored by the referee and no VAR checks were carried out. England persevered and scored a second goal in the 91st minute, again by Kane, resulting in a 2–1 victory.\nIn the second match, England surpassed their record for goals scored in a World Cup match by beating Panama 6–1. Jesse Lingard scored the third goal, John Stones scored the first and fourth goals and Kane scored a hat-trick.\nIn the final group match, England lost 1–0 to Belgium. Adnan Januzaj scored the sole goal of the game, but both teams fielded reserve teams and England made nine changes. Before the game, media outlets stated that a loss could become beneficial, as the winner would be in the half of the draw with four of the top seven sides in the world. The result meant England finished second in the group, setting up a last 16 clash with the Group H winners, Colombia.\nEngland played their last 16 match in the Otkritie Arena, Moscow, with the same team as against Tunisia. Kane scored his sixth goal of the tournament, and the third penalty, after once again being fouled in the box from a corner, as against Panama. The score remained at 1–0 until stoppage time, when a header from Yerry Mina beat Jordan Pickford to take the game to extra time. Neither team scored again, and the match went to a penalty shoot-out, which England won 4–3. It was the first time England had won a World Cup penalty shoot-out. The match was notable for the heated atmosphere in which it was played, with eight yellow cards being shown.\nEngland played against Sweden in their quarter-final at Cosmos Arena, Samara on 7 July 2018. They won 2–0, with defender Harry Maguire scoring his first England goal, a header scored from a corner, and Dele Alli a second header from close range. This sent them through to the semi-finals, their first since 1990 and third overall at the World Cup. They lost 2–1 after extra time to Croatia in the semi-finals. England lost again to Belgium in the third place play-off, thanks to goals from Thomas Meunier and Eden Hazard, despite an Eric Dier shot being cleared off the line by Toby Alderweireld. They finished fourth, their best result since 1990.\nEngland scored nine goals from set-pieces in the tournament, the most by a team in a single World Cup tournament since 1966.\nQatar 2022.\nIn qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, England were drawn in UEFA Group I along with Poland, Hungary, Albania, Andorra and San Marino.\nThe qualifying process began in March 2021, with England winning each of their first five matches: 5–0 at home to San Marino, 2–0 away to Albania, 2–1 at home to Poland, 4–0 away to Hungary and 4–0 at home to Andorra. They were then held to a 1–1 draw in the return match against Poland at the Stadion Narodowy in Warsaw, substitute Damian Szymański scoring a 92nd-minute equaliser after Harry Kane had given England the lead midway through the second half. They returned to winning ways in October 2021 with a 5–0 away win over Andorra, before another draw at home to Hungary a few days later. Nevertheless, a 5–0 win at home to Albania in November 2021 meant England needed just a point in their final World Cup qualifier away to San Marino, then the bottom-ranked side in the world rankings, to win the group and secure automatic qualification. England beat San Marino 10–0, their record victory in a competitive match, to finish top of the group, six points clear of Poland.\nThe final draw for the World Cup took place on 1 April 2022 at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center. They were the seeded team in Group B, into which they were drawn with Iran, the United States and the winners of UEFA Play-off Path A, later confirmed to be Wales.\nEngland beat Iran 6–2 in their first group match on 21 November 2022. England's goalscorers were Jude Bellingham who scored in the 35th minute of the match, Bukayo Saka who scored two goals in the 43rd minute and 62nd minute of the game, Raheem Sterling who scored one minute into first half stoppage time, Marcus Rashford in the 71st minute and Jack Grealish in the 89th. The Iranian goals were both scored by Mehdi Taremi, the first after 65 minutes and the second from a penalty 13 minutes into stoppage time.\nEngland drew 0–0 with the United States in their second group match on 25 November 2022 and then beat Wales 3–0 in their last group match, on 29 November 2022. The goalscorers were Rashford, who scored in the 50th minute and 68th minutes of the match, and Phil Foden who scored in the 51st minute. England finished in first place in Group B.\nEngland released a statement on 30 November 2022 to announce that defender Ben White had withdrawn from the squad for personal reasons.\nEngland beat Senegal 3–0 in the second round on 4 December 2022. The goalscorers were Jordan Henderson, who scored in the 38th minute of the match, Kane, who scored in the third minute of first half stoppage time, and Saka, who scored in the 57th minute.\nEngland played France on 10 December 2022 in the quarter-finals. They lost 2–1 despite having an opportunity to equalise through a penalty by Kane, and were eliminated when Marcus Rashford hit a free kick over in the 100th minute. England were named as the winners of the FIFA Fair Play Trophy.\nPlayer records.\nList of foreign-based England players at World Cups.\nHistorically, very few English World Cup squad members were playing for a club in a foreign league at the time of their selection to the national squad.\nTeam awards and records.\nTeam awards\nIndividual awards\nIndividual records\nRefereeing.\nThree FIFA World Cup finals were officiated by English referees, more than by any other football association. The first Englishman to officiate a decisive match, George Reader, is also the oldest World Cup referee to date, as he was 53 years and 236 days old in the 1950 decisive match between Uruguay and Brazil. The actual final referees are William Ling (1954), Jack Taylor (1974) and Howard Webb (2010).\nArthur Ellis, who was a linesman for the 1950 decisive match, is part of an elite group of referees who have been called up for three consecutive World Cups (1950, 1954 and 1958)."

        "title": "Tennis in China",
        "text": "Tennis in China is a rapidly growing sport that has received much private and public support, and has today become firmly entrenched in the Chinese as one of the most popular. Tennis is now the third-most popular sport on television in China, behind Association football and basketball. The national governing body is the China Tennis Association.\nChina has 30,000 tennis courts and an estimated 14 million people in China regularly play tennis, up from 1 million when the sport returned to the Olympics in 1988, according to the WTA Tour. The Chinese government is aiming to increase that by 15 percent every year. The nation's tennis market has reached $4 billion annually, according to Tom Cannon, a professor and sports finance expert at the University of Liverpool Management School in England.\nThe women's tour in 2014 upgraded the China Open in Beijing to become the only combined event with the men's tour in Asia. Played at the Beijing Olympic Tennis Center with combined prize money of $6.6 million and a main stadium that holds 10,000 spectators, the China Open is now one of the WTA's top four tournaments. The ATP's other flagship tournament in Asia is the $3.24 million Shanghai Masters.\nChina Open Rating Tour.\nThe China Open Rating Tour (CRT) is to be launched in April 2009. The CRT is the new national amateur tennis league and is an effort to spur greater interest in tennis at the grassroots level.\nThe CRT will be divided into three levels of proficiency to sharpen its competitive edge, similar to a boxing competition with different weight classes. It will feature singles, doubles and mixed doubles play. Winners of each competition level will battle for the national trophy during the newly promoted China Open tournament that runs from Oct 1-11.\nThe tournament will be divided into six regions, with seven cities hosting competition. The regions and cities include: North (Beijing), Northeast (Shenyang), Central (Wuhan), East (Shanghai), South (Guangzhou) and West (Kunming and Chengdu).\nAmateurs and retired professionals of any age – or nationality – are invited to apply to compete in the CRT via the league's official website.\nOverview and history.\nOverall there are four fundamental reasons that have contributed to the growth of tennis in China. Firstly, the national economy has improved enormously and the booming middle class sees tennis as a family sport and a way to improve social status. Secondly, there has been the emergence of higher ranked players from other parts of Asia, such as Japan, India, Thailand and Indonesia all of whom spur competition and standard of play. Thirdly, the investment of the International Tennis Federation and the Chinese Tennis Association in the development of the grass-roots game has been crucial. And finally there are the Beijing Olympics, considered as a way to raise the profile of sports in China.\nWhen tennis became a fully-fledged Olympic sport, the government began to invest money in the sport. This became a trend in many parts of the world, such as Russia, Serbia and Croatia. Funds were also secured to send teams of players overseas. The women's national team soon reached the elite World Group in the Fed Cup. With funding issues taken care of, the players and their coaches were able to concentrate totally on training and preparation. New programs were introduced for speed and stamina training and for developing technical expertise.\nWhile Chinese women players dominate the scene today, it was the men who made the initial breakthrough. In 2003, at the Heineken Open in Shanghai, wildcards Zeng Shaoxuan and Zhu Benqiang made an important advance. They became the first players from China to reach a tour-level doubles final.\nLi Ting and Sun Tiantian won the doubles gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics.\nIn 2006, more tennis history was written when Zheng Jie and Yan Zi won doubles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Li Na at the same Wimbledon year, became the first Chinese player to reach a Grand Slam singles quarter-final and also the first player from China to be ranked in the world's top 20. Li Na and Zheng Jie were also the first players to compete in an all-Chinese final - in Estoril (Portugal) in 2006. At Wimbledon in 2008, Zheng Jie became first Chinese player ever to reach semifinals of a Grand Slam singles tournament, and in 2009, became the first Chinese player to be ranked in the world's top 15, as world number 15.\nDuring the 2010 Australian Open, Li Na and compatriot Zheng Jie made history for becoming the first two Chinese players to reach the top four of a Grand Slam tournament simultaneously. The media dubbed the players as the two \"Golden Flowers,\" and many heralded their feat as a breakthrough for Chinese tennis. In 2011, Li Na became the first player to reach the final of the Australian Open but was unable to take the title. Months later, Li reached her second consecutive Grand Slam final at the French Open and won her first Grand Slam singles title, thus becoming the first player from Asia to win a Slam. Her feat has sparked a major population growth of tennis players in China. Others have suggested it signals the emergence of China as a tennis power.\nAcademies.\nThe Michael Chang Mission Hills Tennis Academy (which has 50 courts) opened in 2008 in Shenzhen, where Michael Chang aims to nurture young Chinese players in a bid to bring the level of Chinese tennis up to the international standard. He intends to contribute his experience accumulated from playing in world tournaments to the development of tennis in China. Chang is very popular in China, where he is better known by his Mandarin name \"Zhang Depei\". Chang, who retired in 2002, has worked as a coach with Peng Shuai in 2007.\nStatistics By Player.\nPlayers shown in bold are active.\nVenues.\nSince its return in 2005, the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai has been held at the spectacular Qi Zhong Stadium, a facility that many believe features the best tennis court in the world. In China, feng shui plays an important cultural role. Placement and arrangement of space to achieve harmony with the environment was crucial. All this was taken into consideration in the design of Qi Zhong, built on unused land about 32 kilometers from the center of Shanghai. In less than 18 months the 15,000-seat stadium was constructed with a retractable roof unlike any other in the world. Named after the flower of Shanghai, the \"magnolia roof\" twists as it opens and closes. It comprises eight panels or \"petals\" - eight is considered a very lucky number in China.\nWTA.\nThe WTA is to set up its regional office in Beijing in 2008 and the city has been awarded one of the WTA's premier events. In 2009, the China Open will be combined event for women and men. It is one of the four mandatory events for the WTA and it will be played at the new Olympic Green Tennis Centre, built for tennis matches at the 2008 Olympic Games.\nOn 1 December 2021, WTA suspended all tournaments in China amid concerns about the safety of the Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai. The safety of Peng Shuai became a matter of international concern after she made sexual assault allegations against Zhang Gaoli, a former China vice-premier.\nNotable players.\n\"See: \"\nChinese women have won Olympic and Grand Slam doubles titles over the last six years, while Li Na and Zheng Jie have made the most significant breakthroughs in singles by reaching semifinals at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Li was the first Chinese player to break into the top 10 of the women's game and win a singles grand slam in 2011 at the French Open. China's Li Ting and Sun Tian Tian won the women's doubles gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics. In 2006, Zheng and Yan Zi became the country's first Grand Slam champions, taking the women's doubles titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. At the, Zheng and Yan got a bronze medal in the women's doubles. China now has three women inside the top 50.\nOn the men's side, Zhang Zhizhen became the first Chinese player to reach the ATP's top 100. Wu Yibing became the first Chinese male player to win a men's singles match in a major at the 2022 US Open and the first Chinese male player in the Open Era to reach the third round of a major. He made his debut in the top 100 in February 2023, and became the first Chinese player in history to win an ATP title. 17 year old Shang Juncheng also has a position inside the top 200. Shang finished runner-up at the 2021 Junior US Open."

        "text": "The 1987 PGA Championship was the 69th PGA Championship, held August 6–9 at the Champion Course of PGA National Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. In hot and windy conditions, Larry Nelson won his second PGA Championship in a sudden-death playoff over 1977 champion Lanny Wadkins. It was Nelson's third and final major title.\nD.A. Weibring, a 54-hole co-leader, shot 76 (+4) and finished a stroke back at even-par 288. The other co-leader, Mark McCumber, posted 77 and finished in a tie for fifth. Two major champions in contention shot high scores and fell back: Seve Ballesteros (78) and Raymond Floyd (80).\nIn the August heat of Florida, the attendance was low. A record high temperature for the day of was recorded on Sunday. It was the second major played in Florida, following the PGA Championship in 1971, played in February at the old PGA National. Through 2021, this is the last major played in the state. The purse was the last under $1 million at the PGA Championship.\nWith the win, Nelson gained an automatic bid to the Ryder Cup team in 1987, his third, bumping Don Pooley. Nelson's record in that competition in late September was 0–3–1, as the U.S. lost the Cup for the first time on home soil. He lost all three pairs matches and halved his singles match.\nThe Champion Course hosted the Ryder Cup in 1983 and the Senior PGA Championship for 19 years (1982–2000).

        "title": "Chris Davis (baseball)",
        "text": "Christopher Lyn Davis (born March 17, 1986), nicknamed \"Crush Davis\", is an American former professional baseball first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers and Baltimore Orioles. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. While primarily a first baseman throughout his career, Davis also spent time at designated hitter, third baseman, and outfielder.\nDavis attended Navarro Junior College and was selected by the Rangers in the fifth round of the 2006 MLB draft. He ascended quickly through the Rangers' minor league system, getting named their Minor League Player of the Year in 2007. He was called up in the middle of 2008 and had a strong start to his major league career. He was the Rangers' starting first baseman for 92 games in 2009 and hit 21 home runs, but a low batting average and his tendency to strike out left the Rangers dissatisfied with him. Because of this, the Rangers sent Davis back and forth between the minors and the majors over the next two years and left him off their playoff roster in 2010. On July 30, 2011, they traded him to the Orioles.\nDavis appeared in 31 games for the Orioles in 2011. In the lineup full-time in 2012, he hit 33 home runs while batting .270 and helping the Orioles reach the playoffs for the first time since 1997. In 2013, his 53 home runs led all MLB players and set a new Orioles single-season franchise record. Davis also had 138 runs batted in (RBIs), was selected to the All-Star Game, and finished third in American League Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting. In September 2014, Davis was suspended for 25 games for testing positive for amphetamine; he asserted that he tested positive due to the use of Adderall, for which he previously had a \"therapeutic use exemption\". Davis missed the Orioles' seven postseason games in 2014 due to his suspension.\nThe Orioles signed Davis to a seven-year, $161 million contract in January 2016. In 2018, he set the MLB record for the lowest batting average ever for a qualified player, batting .168. In 2019, Davis set the MLB record for the most consecutive at bats by a position player without a hit, going 0-for-54. Davis announced his retirement on August 12, 2021.\nHigh school and college.\nDavis was born in Longview, Texas. He has an older sister, Jennifer. While he was in high school, his parents divorced. Davis attended Longview High School, playing shortstop on the school's varsity baseball team and pitching as well before graduating in 2004. He was originally chosen by the New York Yankees as the third-to-last pick of the 2004 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft (1,496th overall in the 50th round). However, he did not sign and opted to attend Navarro Junior College in Texas instead, beginning in 2005. At Navarro, he was used as a third baseman and first baseman. He was once again drafted, by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, in the 2005 MLB draft, however he did not sign. He was named a preseason JUCO All-American by \"Baseball America\" in 2006, earning Region XIV East Zone Most Valuable Player honors. That year with Navarro, he hit 17 home runs, one of which hit a retail building 100 feet away beyond the 380 sign on the outfield fence. Davis was then drafted again, this time by the Texas Rangers in the fifth round of the 2006 MLB draft. Davis was inducted to the Navarro College athletic hall of fame in 2021.\nProfessional career.\nMinor league career.\nDavis began his minor league career in 2006 with the Spokane Indians of the Single-A short season Northwest League, splitting time between the outfield and first base. In 69 games, he batted .277 with 70 hits, 18 doubles, 15 home runs, 42 runs batted in (RBI), and 65 strikeouts (eighth). Early in his minor league career, Davis struggled with his weight. At one point, he weighed 265 pounds, but he later learned to eat healthier and lost weight.\nIn 2007, Davis began the season with the Bakersfield Blaze of the Single-A advanced California League. He tied a California League record by posting a 35-game hitting streak and was selected to the Single-A advanced All-Star Game. On July 30, he was promoted to the Frisco RoughRiders of the Double-A Texas League, where he spent the rest of the season. Despite his call-up, he tied for fourth in the California League with 24 home runs and ranked fourth in the league with a .573 slugging percentage, leading Bakersfield in home runs, RBI, and doubles. With Frisco, he had 11 home runs and 25 RBI in the month of August and was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. In 129 games combined, used exclusively as a third baseman, Davis batted .297 with 36 home runs and 118 RBI in 2007. After the season, he was named the Rangers' Tom Grieve Minor League Player of the Year.\nEntering 2008, \"Baseball America\" ranked Davis the number two prospect in the Rangers' organization, behind Elvis Andrus. Davis began the season playing first base for Frisco. He batted .333 with 62 hits, 13 home runs, and 42 RBI in 46 games before earning a promotion to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League. In 31 games with Oklahoma, he hit .333 with 37 hits, 10 home runs, and 31 RBI. He was named to the All-Star Futures Game but was unable to play in it because he was promoted to the major leagues by the Texas Rangers. Later, during his breakout 2013 season, Davis referred to his time with Round Rock in 2008: \"I know nobody really cares about Triple-A, but I put up these numbers up in Triple-A. That was kind of the question, 'Was he going to be able to do it at the big league level?' The thing about it was, I just couldn't do it consistently. I couldn't put the bat on the ball. I was striking out an astronomical amount, and this year it's just been consistency day in and day out.\"\nTexas Rangers.\n2008.\nOn June 26, 2008, the Rangers called up Davis from Oklahoma, and that day he made his major league debut in a 7–2 loss to the Houston Astros, getting a hit in his first Major League at bat, against Óscar Villarreal. Davis started his first Major League game at first base on June 27, 2008, and hit his first Major League home run during the game, against Clay Condrey in an 8–7 win over the Philadelphia Phillies. He also homered the next day, becoming the first Texas Ranger to homer in both of his first two Major League starts. He took over from Frank Catalanotto at first base.\nBy virtue of his hot start with the Rangers, and his considerable power as a batter, Davis was dubbed \"Crush Davis\" by local media and fans (a play on \"Crash Davis\" from the movie \"Bull Durham\"). From July 22 through July 26, he had four straight multi-hit games. Davis played well enough that, upon Hank Blalock's return from the disabled list (DL) on August 22, he was moved to third base so he could remain in the lineup. He had four hits on September 26 in a 12–1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nIn 80 games (295 at bats), Davis batted .285 with 84 hits, 23 doubles, 17 home runs, and 55 RBI. He struck out 88 times, which was 30% of his at bats. Defensively, he was much better at first base than third, with a .997 fielding percentage at first as opposed to a .962 percentage at third and a higher range factor as well.\n2009.\nDavis slumped a bit in 2009 spring training but still began 2009 as the Rangers' first baseman. Rangers manager Ron Washington said, \"I'm not worried about Chris. Chris works hard. He had a little spell where he was trying to get himself together. He's going to have bad times, but what he did tonight is what he's capable of and he'll do that enough to make you love him.\" On May 14, with the Rangers trailing 2–1 in the ninth inning against the Seattle Mariners, he homered against Brandon Morrow to give the Rangers a 3–2 victory. After a 1-for-29 slump, Davis hit two home runs on May 26 in a 7–3 victory over the New York Yankees. He had four hits on June 25, the fourth a 12th-inning two-run home run against Esmerling Vásquez in a 9–8 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nOn July 5, Davis was sent back down to make room for Josh Hamilton who was coming off the disabled list. Although he had 15 home runs in 258 at bats, he was leading the American League with 114 strikeouts and had, on June 21, become the quickest player in Major League history to reach 100 strikeouts, requiring only 219 at bats. His batting average was at .202. While talking about the Rangers' handling of another player, Julio Borbon, in 2010, Washington mentioned the decision to send Davis down in 2009: \"We gave Chris a good amount of time last year. With young players, they can look bad for 100 at bats and then turn it around the next 100 and look exactly like you want them to.\" With the RedHawks, Davis played 44 games, batting .327 with six home runs, 12 doubles, and 30 RBI.\nDavis was recalled on August 25 after Andruw Jones went on the DL and Blalock struggled. On September 8, in the second game of a doubleheader, he had three hits and four RBI, including a three-run home run against José Veras in a 10–5 victory over the Cleveland Indians. When Davis returned to the majors, his numbers improved dramatically, as he hit .318 in September and October, with five home runs and 21 RBIs in the two-month span. In 113 games (391 at bats), Davis batted .238 with 93 hits, 15 doubles, 21 home runs, and 59 RBI. However, he ranked seventh in the AL with 150 strikeouts. He did do well defensively; Washington said, when Blalock replaced him at first following his demotion, \"We can't expect Hank Blalock to be Chris Davis [defensively], but Hank is a professional. I think he can play first base.\"\n2010.\nDavis was once again optioned to Triple-A after starting 2010 batting .188 in 15 games (48 at bats). He was recalled on July 9 to play first base for the Rangers. A roster spot, as well as a position in the Rangers starting lineup, became available when Justin Smoak was involved in a trade with the Seattle Mariners for Cliff Lee. On July 29, he was sent back to the RedHawks to make room for Mitch Moreland. In 103 games (398 at bats) with the RedHawks, he had 130 hits, 31 doubles, 14 home runs, and 80 RBI. He finished second in the league in hitting (.327, behind John Lindsey's .353) and fifth in strikeouts (105). He was recalled for the final time on September 11 but this time was used as a backup corner infielder and pinch-hitter, as Moreland was playing first base. In 45 games (120 at bats) with Texas, Davis hit .192 with 23 hits, one home run, and four RBI. He was left off the postseason roster as the Rangers entered the World Series for the first time ever but ended up losing in five games to the San Francisco Giants.\nAttempting to aid Davis's offense, the Rangers tried to get Davis to widen his batting stance. However, playing in the Dominican Winter League over the offseason, Davis \"felt like I fouled a lot of pitches off that I should have driven.\" He stood more upright and kept his feet closer together and, in 2013, said that this was a defining moment in his career.\n2011.\nIn 2011, Davis began the season in the minors but was called up from Triple-A to play for the Rangers on April 11 when Hamilton suffered a fracture of the humerus bone in his shoulder. However, it was with reluctance that the Rangers recalled Davis; general manager Jon Daniels said, \"We talked about another center fielder or a third catcher and think we will address that at some point. But whoever we called up wasn't going to get regular playing time, so we felt Chris was the most deserving.\" Used in a part-time role, Davis remained with the club until Hamilton came off the DL on May 23. He was also called up for a game on June 8 when Ian Kinsler was placed on paternity leave. His 2011 totals with the Rangers were a .250 batting average with 19 hits, three home runs, and six RBI in 28 games (76 at bats). Davis fared better with the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate, which had become the Round Rock Express in 2011. He had five-RBI games twice and in June batted .361 with 10 home runs and 28 RBI. Despite playing only 48 games with Round Rock in 2011, Davis finished seventh in the Pacific Coast League with 24 home runs.\nBaltimore Orioles.\n2011.\nOn July 30, 2011, Davis was traded with pitcher Tommy Hunter to the Baltimore Orioles for reliever Koji Uehara. Davis became expendable, because the Rangers felt Moreland was a better option at first base. Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said the day of the trade that he knew there was a possibility Davis could turn into a high-impact offensive player, and \"If he does, we'll live with it.\" Opinions differed as to Davis's inability to hold a consistent starting role with the Rangers. While one popular idea was that it was because of his many strikeouts and low batting average, Orioles manager Buck Showalter believed it was due to the presence of Moreland and Adrián Beltré in Texas. Davis said, \"I'm glad to get the opportunity to come here\", citing his desire to play every day.\nIn his second game as an Oriole, on August 2, Davis homered for his first Oriole hit against Everett Teaford in an 8–2 victory over the Kansas City Royals. He received everyday playing time but went on the DL on August 14 with a right shoulder strain, an injury which was initially feared to be season-ending but wound up keeping him out only until September 6. In an 11-inning 5–4 victory over the Yankees on September 7, he struck out five times, the first Oriole to strike out that many times since Phil Bradley did so exactly 22 years before. He had three-hit games on September 8 and 19. On September 14, he had a season-high three RBI with a three-run home run against Wade Davis in a 6–2 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays.\nDavis played 31 games for the Orioles, batting .276/.310/.398 with 34 hits, two home runs, 13 RBIs, and 39 strikeouts in 123 at bats. In a combined 59 games with Texas and Baltimore, he batted .266 with 53 hits, 12 doubles, five home runs, 19 RBI, and 63 strikeouts.\n2012.\nDavis received everyday playing time in 2012, starting at first base, at designated hitter, and in the outfield throughout the season. On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9–6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat was the first of its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902.\nOn July 31, Davis hit his first career grand slam, off Yankees pitcher Iván Nova in an 11–5 win after the Orioles had faced a five-run deficit. On August 24, Davis had his first career three-homer game in a 6–4 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. His second home run was his 22nd of the season, setting a new career high, and it marked the first three-homer game by an Oriole since Nick Markakis had one in 2006. After Markakis suffered a season-ending injury on September 8, Davis moved to right field for the remainder of the season and the playoffs.\nDue to a late-season stretch in which he homered six times in the final six games, he finished the regular season with 33 home runs, more than any other Oriole. In 139 games (515 at bats), he batted .270/.326/.501 with 139 hits, 20 doubles, and 85 RBI. His 33 home runs also tied Robinson Canó for eighth in the AL while his 169 strikeouts tied B. J. Upton for fourth.\nThe Orioles reached the playoffs for the first time since 1997, claiming one of the AL Wild Card spots and defeating the Rangers in the 2012 AL Wild Card Game. In Game 2 of the 2012 AL Division Series (ALDS) against the Yankees, Davis had a two-run single against Andy Pettitte in the Orioles' 3–2 victory. Those were his only RBI of the series; he had four hits in 20 at bats as the Yankees defeated the Orioles in five games.\n2013.\nThe Orioles decided to put Davis at first base full-time in 2013 and worked on his defense in spring training; later, Oriole coaches and teammates believed this helped Davis succeed at the plate as well. He set a personal home run goal before the season but refused to share it. On April 5, Davis set a new Major League record with 16 RBI in the first four games of a season. He also became the fourth MLB player in history to hit a home run in the first four games of the season (Nelson Cruz, Mark McGwire, Willie Mays), including a grand slam against Tyler Robertson in the fourth game, a 9–5 victory over the Minnesota Twins.\nOn June 16, he hit the 100th home run of his career, off Red Sox pitcher Jon Lester in a 6–3 victory. On July 11, he hit his 34th home run of the season, eclipsing his previous season high in a 3–1 victory over the Rangers. He earned his 87th and 88th RBIs of the season with a two-run home run against Mark Buehrle on July 12, setting a new Orioles record for most RBIs before the All-Star break; the previous record was 86 by Boog Powell. He ultimately ended up with 93 RBIs before the All-Star break. On July 14, he hit his 37th home run of the season against Josh Johnson in a 7–4 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, tying Reggie Jackson for the second most home runs before the All-Star break by any MLB player and the most by an American League player. The home run was also his 500th career hit.\nDavis received a tweet on June 30 from Michael Tran in Michigan asking him if he had ever used steroids. He responded \"No\", that same day. Davis said later in an interview, \"I have not ever taken any PEDs. I'm not sure fans realize, we have the strictest drug testing in all of sports, even more than the Olympics. If anybody was going to try to cheat in our game, they couldn't. It's impossible to try to beat the system. Anyway, I've never taken PEDs, no. I wouldn't. Half the stuff on the list I can't even pronounce.\" Later, Davis would say that he believed Roger Maris's 61 home run season was the true single-season home run record, due to the steroid scandal surrounding Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Mark McGwire.\nOn July 6, Davis was elected to start the 2013 All-Star Game, his first ever appearance. He was the leading vote-getter with 8,272,243 votes. Davis was also chosen to participate in the Home Run Derby for the first time, by American League captain Robinson Canó. Davis advanced to the second round and hit a total of 12 home runs. However, a blister broke on his hand, leaving him unable to hit enough homers to advance to the third and final round. At the All-Star Game the next night, July 16, 2013, Davis went 1–3, with a fly out, a single and a strikeout. Davis's single against Patrick Corbin advanced Miguel Cabrera to third, where he would score the game's first run on José Bautista's sacrifice fly.\nDavis's 50th home run of the season, which he hit on September 13, tied him with Brady Anderson for the Orioles record of most home runs in a single season. He also became only the third player in MLB history, after Babe Ruth (New York Yankees, 1921) and Albert Belle (Cleveland Indians, 1995), to hit 50 home runs and 40 doubles in a single season. He hit his 51st home run on September 17, setting a new Orioles single season record. This was also his 92nd extra-base hit of the season, again tying Anderson for a franchise record. He later surpassed that by hitting his first triple of the season against Alex Cobb on September 21 in a 5–1 loss to Tampa Bay. Davis broke another Orioles record on September 27 with his 28th home run of the season hit at his home park of Camden Yards, surpassing Frank Robinson's record of 27 home runs hit at Memorial Stadium in 1966.\nIn 2013, Davis led all MLB batters in home runs (53), runs batted in (138), extra-base hits (96), and total bases (370). His 53 home runs, 96 extra-base hits, and 199 strikeouts all set new Orioles single-season records. In AL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting, Davis finished third behind Cabrera and Mike Trout, as the Orioles failed to return to the playoffs.\nDavis's breakout year led to compliments from his peers. Teammate Adam Jones summarized his style: \"Most of his home runs are just line drives that get out. Obviously he hits some moonshots too.\" Cliff Lee, Davis's teammate in Texas in 2010, said, \"Watching his highlights, you can totally tell that he's relaxed and just letting it happen. He's not putting anything extra into it. It's just nice and easy, and it's impressive to watch. ... He and Miguel Cabrera are the two best power hitters in the game, in my opinion.\"\n2014.\nDavis missed 12 games from April 26, 2014, to May 11, 2014, with a left oblique strain. He hit three home runs and had five RBI on May 20 in a 9–2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. On June 17, facing Érik Bédard with the bases loaded, Davis hit a ball to left field that hit off the left field foul pole at Tropicana Field. Initially ruled a double, the umpires changed it to a grand slam after a review. The Orioles went on to defeat the Rays 7–5. After a 4-for-36 slump, Davis was benched on June 23, but he had a pinch-hit walk off three-run home run against Ronald Belisario, giving the Orioles a 6–4 victory over the Chicago White Sox. It was the Orioles' first game-ending pinch hit home run since Larry Sheets had one on August 24, 1988.\nDavis struggled in the first half of 2014, hitting 15 home runs but batting around .200. The slump continued, as he batted .202 in July and saw himself dropped to seventh in the batting order in August. Showalter said, \"It's hard to follow that pace. He spoiled us at a very high level. He wants to get back to it.\" Despite his slump, the Orioles through August 23 had built a seven-game lead in the AL East.\nOn September 12, Davis was suspended for 25 games for testing positive for amphetamine. Davis claimed he tested positive due to the use of Adderall, for which he previously had a \"therapeutic use exemption\", although he did not have that exemption for the 2014 season. Davis' suspension covered the final 17 games of the 2014 regular season and the seven games the Orioles played in the 2014 postseason.\nFor the 2014 season, he batted .196 (the lowest batting average among all qualified MLB batters)/.300/.404 with 26 home runs and 173 strikeouts (3rd in the AL) in 450 at bats.\n2015.\nDavis received a therapeutic use exemption for Vyvanse, a stimulant drug, prior to the 2015 season. He served the final game of his suspension on Opening Day.\nDavis led the majors in home runs with 47 in 2015. He struck out a major-league-leading 31.0% of the time, batting .262/.361/.562. He led the league in strikeouts (with 208) and was 2nd in the AL in RBIs (117).\n2016.\nOn January 21, 2016, Davis signed a seven-year, $161 million contract to stay with the Orioles. The contract was the largest in Orioles history. In 159 games of 2016, Davis finished the year with a .221/.332/.459 batting line. He hit 38 home runs (finishing eighth in the American League) and drove in 84 runs. He also struck out an MLB-leading 219 times.\n2017.\nDuring 2017, Davis spent a month on the disabled list with a right oblique strain.\nFor the 2017 season, Davis batted .215/.309/.423.

On June 15, the Orioles announced that Davis would be benched and that they would call up Corban Joseph. Davis ended the season hitting .168/.243/.296 with 16 home runs. He also had 192 strikeouts (placing fourth in the American League in that category) in 128 games. His $23 million salary was the 10th-highest in the league. His .168 batting average, .243 on base percentage, and .296 slugging percentage were each the lowest of all qualified major league batters, and the .168 batting average was the lowest of all time for qualified MLB hitters.\n2019.\nAt the end of the 2018 season, starting September 14, Davis began a hitless streak that lasted through his last 21 at bats of the season and continued into 2019. On April 8, 2019, Davis set a new Major League record for the most consecutive at bats by a position player without a hit (46). Davis ended his streak on April 13, after 54 consecutive at bats without a hit, with a two-run single against the Red Sox. \nDavis was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to left hip inflammation on May 26, 2019.\nOn August 7, during a loss to the Yankees, Davis had to be physically restrained by players and coaches after attempting to go after manager Brandon Hyde. Davis finished the season with a .179 batting average and 12 home runs in 105 games.\n2020.\nDavis played in 16 games for the Orioles in 2020 and hit .115 with no home runs and only one RBI.

Davis's production had declined amidst injury struggles during his last few seasons. During the course of the contract he signed in 2016, Davis batted .196/.291/.379, with 92 home runs. At the time of his retirement, Davis was owed $17 million in deferred salary for the 2022 season, as well as $42 million in deferred payments from his 2016 contract. He was scheduled to be paid $9.16 million per year between 2023 and 2025, $3.5 million between 2026 and 2032, and $1.4 million between 2033 and 2037.\nDavis's $161 million contract with Orioles has been described as \"MLB's worst contract bust\", as \"one of the worst contracts ever for a position player\", and as \"the worst contract in sports\".\nPersonal life.\nDavis, his wife, Jill and their three daughters live in Baltimore, Maryland, and Flower Mound, Texas. Before that, they lived in Arlington, Texas. They married in 2011. During the offseason, he enjoys bass fishing.\nDavis is a Christian.

        "title": "2008 World Series of Poker results",
        "text": "The 2008 World Series of Poker was the 39th annual World Series of Poker (WSOP). Held in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino, the 2008 series began on May 30 and featured 55 poker championships in several variants. All events but the $10,000 World Championship No Limit Texas hold 'em Main Event, the most prestigious of the WSOP events, ended by July 15. The final table, known as the November Nine, of the Main Event was suspended until November, to allow for better television coverage. As a WSOP custom since 1976, each of the event winners received a championship bracelet in addition to that event's prize money ranging from US$87,929 for the $500 Casino Employees No-Limit Hold'em to US$9,119,517 for the Main Event.\nMost of the tournaments played at the WSOP are variants of Texas Hold 'em. Hold 'em is a community card game where each player may use any combination of the five community cards and the player's own two hole cards to make a poker hand, in contrast to poker variants such as stud or draw in which each player holds a separate individual hand. Between 2000 and 2009, hold'em has surpassed seven-card stud as the most common game in U.S. casinos, almost totally eclipsing the once popular game. Seven-card stud is a poker variant wherein each player is dealt two hole card, followed by four face up cards, and then another hidden card, with betting after each round. Another poker variant played is Omaha. Omaha is a version of poker wherein each player is dealt four hole cards and must use two of them in conjunction with three community cards to make the best possible five card hand. Other games played at the 2008 tournament included Razz, HORSE, and Deuce-to-Seven.\nWithin each of these poker variants a myriad of options exist. For example, depending on the betting structure, a tournament might be described as no limit, limit or pot-limit. Games may also include other variations on the rules governing the execution of the specific game such as shootout, eight or better, or heads up.\nHighlights of the 2008 series include the selection of Erick Lindgren as the Player of the Year. Before the 2008 WSOP, Lindgren, who won a bracelet and made three final tables, was widely considered to be the \"best player to never win a WSOP bracelet”. Phil Hellmuth, a Poker Hall of Famer, set new records for the most WSOP career cashes (68) and most WSOP career final tables (41). Nikolay Evdakov led all players with a record 10 money finishes. The Main Event, which began with 6,844 participants (a level exceeded only by the number of participants at the 2006 event), was suspended once the event was down to the nine players needed for the final table; the Main Event was resumed on November 9 and concluded with the heads-up final between Peter Eastgate and Ivan Demidov the next day. This year was the first in which the Main Event was suspended in this fashion, a change introduced at ESPN's request to allow the television network to do a same-day Main Event broadcast.\nResults.\nEvent 8: $10,000 World Championship Mixed Event.\n\"Note:\" This event comprised eight poker variants played on a rotating format with one-hour long levels. Every eight hands the game alternated in the following order: Limit Deuce-to-Seven Triple Draw, Limit Hold'em, Limit Omaha Hi-Low Split-8 or Better, Razz, Seven-Card Stud, Seven-Card Stud-8 or Better, No-Limit Hold'em, Pot-Limit Omaha."

        "text": "The 1950 Ice Hockey World Championships, were the 17th World Championships and 28th European Championships were held from 13 to 22 March 1950 in London, England. Canada, represented by the Edmonton Mercurys, won its 13th World Championship. Highest ranking European team Switzerland finished third, winning its fourth European Championship. Defending World and European champion Czechoslovakia was absent from the tournament.\nHistory and political issues.\nOfficially, the defending champion Czechoslovaks did not arrive in London because two of their journalists did not receive their visas. In reality, communist authorities had become uneasy after the LTC Praha (LTC Prague) club team had suffered defections at the 1948 Spengler Cup in Davos, the death of six national team players in a plane crash a few months before the 1949 World Ice Hockey Championships, and the defection of former national hockey team player (and future Wimbledon tennis champion) Jaroslav Drobný in June 1949. The authorities arrested several members of the 1950 national team while they were awaiting their delayed flight at the Prague Airport. On 7 October 1950, the players appeared in court charged with espionage and were named \"state traitors.\" At issue was the claim that several players on the 1950 national team, who played their club hockey with LTC Praha, had discussed defecting in Davos in 1948—though only Miroslav Sláma, two other players and one of the heads of the delegation had actually defected at that Spengler Cup tournament. All twelve men were convicted, with sentences ranging from eight months to 15 years. Then current LTC Praha and former national team goaltender Bohumil Modrý, a delegate with the 1950 national team, was the one to receive the 15 year sentence, as he was mysteriously cast as the \"main figure\" in the potential defection plan.\nDespite the politics, International Ice Hockey Federation president W. G. Hardy stressed that the event was \"to promote international amity\". Hardy credited the Sweden men's national ice hockey team for great improvements reflecting the growth of the game in Sweden.\nWorld Hockey Championships (in London, England).\nIn a format similar to the 1949 championships, in the initial round, the nine teams participating were divided into three groups with three teams each. In the second round, the top two teams in each group advanced to the medal pool (for positions 1 through 6) with the remaining three teams advancing to the consolation pool for places 7 through 9.\nFirst Round.\nGroup A.\nStandings\nGroup B.\nStandings\nGroup C.\nStandings\nConsolation round – places 7 to 9.\nStandings\nFinal Round – places 1 to 6.\nStandings\nNote: While the U.S. team technically placed second, Switzerland as the European Champion received the Silver Medal.

He served as the head football coach at Belhaven College from 2006 to 2008, Olivet Nazarene University from 2009 to 2010, Concordia College Alabama from 2012 to 2013, and Virginia University of Lynchburg from 2014 to 2016. Lee was the second African American head coach in history of the NAIA's Mid-South Conference and is a recipient of a National Football League minority coach fellowship.\nPlaying career.\nLee played defensive end at Olivet Nazarene University from 1990 until 1993, where he also earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Physical Education in 1995.\nCoaching career.\nAssistant coaching.\nLee's coaching career began with Momence High School in Momence, Illinois, where he served as outside linebackers coach for the school. His next move was Middle Georgia College as the defensive ends coach from 1995 to 1997. At Middle Georgia, the defense was ranked seventh in the NJCAA in total defense during the 1995 season.\nLee entered the collegiate coaching ranks as defensive line coach at Southwest Baptist University from 1997 until 2001, and in 2002 moved to be the linebackers coach at the University of the Cumberlands in Kentucky. His next move was to become an assistant coach at Belhaven, where he would later become the head coach.\nBelhaven.\nLee was the head football coach at Belhaven College in Jackson, Mississippi from 2006 to 2008. He was the fourth head football coach at the school. His record at Belhaven was 13–20. The team won the Mid-South Conference West Division title in the process.\nAfter several years as an assistant coach, Lee began his tenure at Belhaven by producing only the second winning season in the history of the school's football program in 2006. \nLee has modified the school's approach of bringing in junior college transfer students to play and is focusing on building through new recruits. He has accented that program by bolstering a junior varsity schedule which encourages incoming freshmen to choose Belhaven through the desire of more playing time. In 2007, his team Belhaven, produced a 5–6 overall record and averaged 33.7 points and allowed 37.3 per game. His challenges in the 2008 season include overcoming being outscored in the fourth quarter of play and overcoming a four win losing streak to begin the season.\nOlivet Nazarene.\nIn December 2008, Lee was hired to serve as head coach of his alma mater Olivet Nazarene in Bourbonnais, Illinois. He resigned after only two seasons in November 2010 and cited family and personal reasons for the resignation. During his two year stint as head coach, Lee led the Tigers to a record of 2–20. Prior to his resignation, Lee notoriously skipped football practice to rake leaves at his home.\nConcordia College Alabama.\nFrom Olivet Nazarene, Lee took an assistant position with Concordia College Alabama. In his first season, the Hornets finished the 2011 season with a 6–5 record, and won their last game against the Division II Stillman. Concordia opened their 2012 season with a 20–19 upset victory over Mississippi Valley State of the Division I FCS. Lee was elevated to head coach of the Hornets after the third game of the 2012 season, after the Shepherd Skanes was fired."

Mark Brooks won his only major championship with a birdie at the first hole of a sudden-death playoff with Kentucky native Kenny Perry. Defending champion Steve Elkington was a stroke out of the playoff, in a tie for third. It was the second consecutive and final sudden-death playoff at the PGA Championship, which changed to a three-hole aggregate format, first used in 2000 at Valhalla.\nIt was the second major played in Kentucky and the first in 44 years; the PGA Championship, a match play event through 1957, was played in Louisville in 1952 at Big Spring Country Club. The championship returned to Valhalla just four years later in 2000, and again in 2014 after hosting the Ryder Cup in 2008.\nCourse designer and five-time champion Jack Nicklaus missed the cut by a single stroke at age 56. He also missed the cut by one stroke in 2000 at age 60, his final appearance in the PGA Championship.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, August 8, 1996\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Friday, August 9, 1996\"\nKenny Perry shot a first round 66 (−6) to take the lead, finishing in the dark. Weather delayed play for nearly four hours and sixty players completed their first rounds on Friday morning.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 9, 1996\"\nPhil Mickelson, age 26, played 24 holes on Friday and carded consecutive rounds of 67 to take a three stroke lead at 134 (−10).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 10, 1996\"\nKentucky native Russ Cochran shot a course record 65 (−7) to take the 54-hole lead, two strokes ahead of Mark Brooks and Vijay Singh. Brooks eagled the par-4 15th, holing out from the fairway. Seeking his first major title, Mickelson fell three strokes back after a 74 (+2).\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 11, 1996\"\nNative sons of Kentucky had different results on Sunday as Cochran shot 77 (+5) in the final pairing and faded while Perry had a 68 (−4) and waited as the clubhouse leader at 277 (−11). Playing with Cochran, Brooks birdied the par-5 final hole to force a playoff. Perry bogeyed the same hole after a hooked tee shot and was in the television booth with CBS-TV, not hitting balls. The second shot of defending champion Steve Elkington found a greenside bunker; he had a birdie putt to join the playoff, but could not convert. Tolles had a long eagle putt to tie but missed, while Singh also needed a birdie to join the playoff but made bogey to finish 2 behind.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\nPlayoff.\nThe sudden-death playoff began on the 18th hole; the par-5 was the course's second-easiest hole on Sunday. Brooks reached the green in two and birdied while Perry's tee shot again found the rough on the left and his fourth was a chip that did not reach the green, ending the playoff. It was Brooks' second birdie at the hole in twenty minutes; in regulation he hit his third shot from the greenside sand to within four feet (1.3 m)."

Points were awarded for reaching at least the semi-finals. The winner of each tournament received five points, the runner-up three and losing semi-finalists one each. These points determined seeding positions for the Grand Final.\nThere was a previous incarnation of the event organised by Matchroom Sport, that ran in the 1987/88 season, and from 1990/91 until 1992/93.\nManagement and purpose.\nThe tour was set up by FSTC Sports Management, who managed leading snooker players John Higgins and Graeme Dott, as well as Eurosport (who screened the events alongside the coverage of the WPBSA tour), Higgins, and leading referee Michaela Tabb. Higgins felt that the game's attendances were too low, and that potential new venues outside the game's traditional United Kingdom and recently developed Far East markets were not being utilised, and wanted to give something back to the sport.

        "text": "Joseph Raymond O'Donnell (August 31, 1941 – January 17, 2019) was an American football player. He played college football as a fullback, guard and tackle for the University of Michigan from 1960 to 1963. He also played professional football as a guard and tackle for eight seasons for the Buffalo Bills in the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL). He was a part of the 1964 and 1965 AFL Championship teams. O'Donnell was an AFL Eastern Division All-Star in 1965. He also came out of retirement to play in the World Football League (WFL) in 1974 and 1975.\nEarly life.\nO'Donnell was born in 1941 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and attended Milan High School in nearby Milan. He was a standout athlete in football, basketball and track. He was an all-state running back in 1958, scoring six touchdowns in a game and 24 in an eight-game season. He also set a Milan school record in basketball with 49 points in a game.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nO'Donnell enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1959. He played for the freshman football team in 1959 as a fullback and retained that position on Michigan's varsity football team in 1960. For the 1961 season, he was moved to the guard position, but broke his arm in the first game against UCLA and sat out the remainder of the season. He was granted an additional year of eligibility due to his missing the 1961 season. He was then moved to the tackle position in 1962 and had more playing time than any other Michigan player that year. At the end of the 1962 season, he was voted by his teammates to be the captain of the 1963 Michigan Wolverines football team.\nIn 1963, O'Donnell moved back to the guard position, and also served as the team's punter. He averaged 36.4 yards per kick on 48 punts during the 1963 season. In the 1963 season opener against SMU, he faked a punt and ran 50 yards for a touchdown. The fake punt was not a called play. O'Donnell said after the game that he saw one side of SMU's line collapse and took off. He also recovered two fumbles in a 1963 victory over Northwestern. At the end of the 1963 season, the Associated Press selected O'Donnell as a first-team player on its 1963 All-Big Ten Conference football team.\nO'Donnell was also an outstanding student at Michigan. He was named to the Big Ten All-Academic teams in 1962 and 1963 and, in 1964, was named to the All-Time All-Academic Big Ten football team.\nProfessional football.\nO'Donnell was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the third round of the 1964 NFL Draft and by the Buffalo Bills in the 13th round of the AFL draft (in that era, the AFL and NFL were separate leagues and held separate drafts). He chose to play for the Bills. O'Donnell played for the Bills, primarily as their right guard from 1964 through 1971. In 1964, he was selected to play in the AFL Pro Bowl.\nHe was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals prior to the 1972 season in exchange for guard Irv Goode. He chose to retire from pro football prior to the 1972 season and so never played with the Cardinals. \nIn 1974, he came out of retirement to play for the Birmingham Americans of the World Football League (WFL). He played for the WFL's Birmingham Vulcans in the 1975 season until the league collapsed.\nPost-retirement.\nAfter retiring from football, O'Donnell started and ran several businesses including a floor-covering business called \"Yardage Distributors\", and a butcher-shop/bakery called \"The Butcher - The Baker\". In 1978, he moved his family from their farm in Eden, New York back to Milan, Michigan. He was active in civic affairs in Milan serving on the school board for many years. In the 1980s he organized the annual \"Great American Pig Roast\" which was a successful fundraising event for the school district. He also served on the coaching staff at Milan High School for many years. In 2010, the high school football field in Milan was renamed \"Joe O'Donnell Field\" in recognition of his service to the community and the football program.\nIn the late 1980s O'Donnell provided the color commentary for the radio broadcasts of the University of Michigan football games on the Michigan Farm Radio Network.\nO'Donnell was married to Caroline (Kerr) O'Donnell (deceased) and has three sons. He died from complications of Alzheimer's disease in 2019."

It was Price's second consecutive major and second PGA Championship in three years. Following this win, he moved to the top of the Official World Golf Ranking.\nPrice became the first to win the Open Championship and PGA Championship in the same year in seven decades, last by Walter Hagen in 1924.

        "text": "The 1963 Rose Bowl was the 49th edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California on Tuesday, January 1, at the end of the 1962 season. The top-ranked USC Trojans defeated the Wisconsin Badgers, 42–37. This was the first matchup between the AP Poll No. 1 vs. No. 2 in a bowl game, although such matchups had occurred previously in the regular season (typically referred to as a \"Game of the Century\"). The game was therefore a de facto national championship game as the winner would receive the FWAA’s Grantland Rice Trophy. The quarterbacks, Ron Vander Kelen of Wisconsin and Pete Beathard of USC, were named co-Players of the Game.\nDown 42–14 in the fourth quarter, Vander Kelen put together a number of drives to score 23 unanswered points and put the Badgers in position to win the game. Due to the historic #1 versus #2 bowl match-up, the number of Rose Bowl records set, and the furious fourth quarter rally by Wisconsin, this game frequently appears on lists of \"greatest bowl games of all time.\"\nTo date, this remains as Wisconsin’s only national championship game appearance.\nTeams.\nThis was the first bowl game to pair the #1 and #2 teams in the AP Poll, although there had previously been six regular season #1 versus #2 games since the inception of the poll in 1936. This was the second Rose Bowl meeting between USC and Wisconsin (the first being the 1953 Rose Bowl) and the fourth meeting, overall.\nWisconsin Badgers.\nWisconsin finished the regular season 8–1, becoming the sole champion of the Big Ten Conference. The Badgers were undefeated except for a loss to conference rival Ohio State at Ohio Stadium, ranked #5 in the AP poll at the time. Notable victories were over then-#1 Northwestern during homecoming (37–6) and a comeback victory over archrival Minnesota, then ranked #5 (14–9). The Badgers earned their third trip to the Rose Bowl.\nUSC Trojans.\nAfter consecutive losing seasons in 1960 and 1961, John McKay turned the Trojans around in his third season as head coach. The team opened with a defeat of #8 Duke. Consecutive wins against SMU, at Iowa, California, and at Illinois got the Trojans ranked higher in the top 10. USC's biggest game of the season was against ninth-ranked Washington; in the homecoming game on November 3, the Trojans blanked the Huskies 14–0. With that win, the Trojans were ranked number two behind Northwestern. On November 17, by beating Navy and with Alabama losing to Georgia Tech 7–6, USC ascended to the number one spot in the AP poll.\nIn the rivalry game against UCLA, the Bruins led 3–0 until the fourth quarter, when the Trojans scored two touchdowns. In the final game for Notre Dame head coach Joe Kuharich, USC shut out the 5–4 Fighting Irish at the Coliseum, breaking a five-game losing streak in the annual intersectional rivalry. The Trojans finished ranked number 1 for the first time in the history of the AP poll, and were undefeated for the first time since the twice-tied 1939 team won the Rose Bowl.\nGame summary.\nUSC tackle Marv Marinovich was ejected when he got caught elbowing Steve Underwood, the Wisconsin captain. Wisconsin, under the direction of quarterback Ron Vander Kelen put together an incredible comeback attempt in the fourth quarter. Pete Beathard had completed his fourth touchdown pass with 14:54 left in the game to put USC up 42–14.\nThen the Badgers, led by Vander Kelen, put together one of the greatest comebacks in the history of college football, scoring 23 unanswered points in the fourth quarter before time ran out. The final score of the game was USC-42, Wisconsin-37. For their efforts, quarterbacks Beathard and Vander Kelen were both named the Rose Bowl MVPs.\nAftermath.\nEleven Rose Bowl records were set and five still stand as of 2008: most intercepted passes (3 by Ron Vander Kelen), most touchdown passes (4 by USC, and six overall), most first downs by one team (32 by Wisconsin), and most penalties (USC 12 for 93 yards). The Rose Bowl record 79 total points scored in this game stood for nearly thirty years (subsequently broken in 1991, when Washington led by 25 and put in reserves early). The omitted records stood for more than thirty years, until broken by Oregon quarterback Danny O'Neil in 1995.\nThe 1964 Cotton Bowl Classic was the next #1 versus #2 bowl game, while the second #1 versus #2 Rose Bowl came in 1969.\nBoth of the consensus All-America ends played in this game. Pat Richter (Wisconsin) and Hal Bedsole (USC) were inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, in 1996 and 2012, respectively. This was Richter's last college game, while Bedsole was an underclassman.\nThree players from this game (Beathard, Vander Kelen, and Richter) have been inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame. John McKay has also been inducted as a coach.\nThe game is considered by many to be among the greatest games in college football history, along with the 2006 Rose Bowl, among others.\nUSC's next Rose Bowl was four years later, the first of four consecutive; Wisconsin did not return for 31 years."

It was the fifth playoff under the sudden-death format at the PGA Championship, first used in 1977.\nNorman was attempting to become the first player to win the Open Championship and PGA Championship in the same year since Walter Hagen in 1924.

        "text": "The Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association (CUFLA) is an association of men's field lacrosse teams connected with several universities in Ontario and Quebec. Teams compete in the fall with league playoffs typically in early November.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1985, the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association, or the \"CUFLA,\" was originally known as the Ontario University Field Lacrosse Association (OUFLA) and, as the name suggests, was entirely Ontario-based. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, OUFLA expanded to include more teams across Ontario.\nHaving grown to 10 teams in 2002, OUFLA changed its name to the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association to reflect the additions of McGill University and Bishop's University, both located in Quebec.\nThe league expanded to 12 teams in 2007 with the additions of Trent (Peterborough) and Laurentian (Sudbury) universities. With these additions the league split into two divisions (east and west) based on geographic location of member schools.\nConcordia University in Montreal became the 13th member, the third in Quebec, in 2012.\nAs it celebrates its 30th year in 2014, the CUFLA has expanded again to 15 teams with the addition of Nipissing University and the University of Ottawa. This ongoing growth bodes well for the continued expansion of men's field lacrosse at various universities across Canada.\nConcordia University left after the 2015 season, leaving the league with 14 teams.\nTeams.\nFormer\nChampions.\nThe Baggataway Cup is the Canadian university field lacrosse championship, awarded annually to the winner of the post-season tournament by the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association. The Baggataway Cup tournament is typically held the second weekend in November, and is hosted by one of the member schools.\nExecutive.\nThe operations of CUFLA are handled by an executive that reports regularly to the team presidents, typically at annual general meetings. Currently, the executive is composed of a commissioner, 2 assistant commissioners, a treasurer, a director of communications, a high school liaison and a referee-in-chief.\nPlayer eligibility.\nOnly current students registered at their respective universities with a full course load are deemed eligible to play in CUFLA competitions. Players who have played professional field lacrosse (such as Major League Lacrosse) are prohibited from playing in CUFLA.\nHowever, players who play professional box lacrosse (such as the National Lacrosse League) are eligible to play. Throughout the years, the league has seen many current and former NLL players scattered throughout various teams.\nAlumni.\nMany current and former players have met with a great deal of success representing their countries or playing professional lacrosse in the National Lacrosse League and Major League Lacrosse. \nMedia coverage.\nMedia coverage of CUFLA has grown in recent years, with local and student newspapers devoting several articles to CUFLA's game results. Several lacrosse websites (Lacrosse All Stars, Inside Lacrosse, The Lacrosse News,Lacrosse Bucket , etc.) and magazines have taken notice and included CUFLA in their ongoing coverage of the world of lacrosse."

        "text": "International Surfing Day, held annually on the third Saturday of June, is an unofficial, environmentally conscious sports-centered holiday that celebrates the sport of surfing, surfing lifestyle, and the sustainability of ocean resources. Contests and prizes are also part of the celebration, with surfing-related industries donating prizes such as surfboards and wetsuits. Another purpose of the celebration is to promote the popularity of surfing and to attract new participants.\nHistory.\nInternational Surfing Day was established in 2005 by \"Surfing Magazine\" and The Surfrider Foundation. International Surfing Day closely follows the spirit and intent of the World Surf Day, established by the Usenet newsgroup alt.surfing in 1993. International Surfing Day is a worldwide celebration of the sport of surfing. The day is observed with surf contests, barbecues, film screenings and other surf-related activities. Surfers also use the day to give back to the environment by organizing beach clean-ups, dune and other habitat restoration and other activities such as lobbying to maintain the recreation areas in California where surfing occurs, or planting Naupaka (a flowering coastal plant) in Hawaii.\nDirect action was used by form of protest on this day in England to express opposition to sewage in the waters of the Gold Coast; a precarious problem for many surfers who become infected by the bacteria from open wounds from sports-related injuries.\nExtent of celebrations.\nInternational Surf Day events have been held on all populated continents including South America where it is celebrated in Argentina, Brazil, and Peru. Also in the Southern Hemisphere the holiday is observed in the Oceanian nations of Australia and New Zealand. The day is also widely observed in the American state of Hawaii, also in Oceania.\nIn North America the surfing day is most widely observed and celebrations may be found in Canada, Costa Rica, the French Antilles, El Salvador, Mexico, and in the majority of coastal states of the United States:\nCalifornia,\nConnecticut,\nDistrict of Columbia,\nFlorida,\nGeorgia,\nMaine,\nMaryland,\nNew Jersey,\nNew York,\nNorth Carolina,\nOregon,\nSouth Carolina,\nTexas,\nand Virginia.\nAfter North America the observance has the most popularity in Europe: including in most of the coastal European Union and it is held by surf enthusiasts in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain, and Belgium. Further European celebrations are held in Norway, in addition to many of the EU nations overseas possessions.\nIn Africa, the two French territories of Réunion and Mayotte hold annual festivities alongside Morocco, the Spanish insular area of the Canary Islands and South Africa. The day has also taken hold in some other countries such as Israel and Japan."

        "title": "1956 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1956 followed a system that had been the object of criticism and reform in recent years, which would continue that summer.\nThe Veterans Committee was meeting only in odd-number years to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, and executives. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent players and elected two, Joe Cronin and Hank Greenberg. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 23, 1956, with Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick presiding.\nCriticism and reform.\nFollowing the election, complaints by the writers that the electees were not up to the standards of previous choices, and that the eligible players included few strong candidates, led to a number of changes in the rules. Foremost among the alterations was the decision to hold future BBWAA elections only in alternating years with the Veterans Committee, and also the elimination of the rule which \"required\" writers to vote for 10 candidates; thereafter, they would be advised only to vote for \"up to\" 10.\nVarious factors over the previous few years had led to the voters' complaints regarding the strength of the eligible candidates. Among these were the decision in the early 1950s to extend the waiting period for eligibility following a player's retirement from one year to five years; as a result, many players who retired in the early 1950s and would otherwise have been eligible were temporarily taken out of contention. Also, many of the players who retired in the late 1940s and early 1950s had careers which were interrupted by military service during World War II, depriving them of accomplishments during those seasons which might have enhanced their qualifications in the eyes of voters. Some players returned from the war with their skills in decline after the long layoff, and retired within a few years when they might otherwise have enjoyed several productive seasons if not for the interruption in their play; in other cases, similar players who might have become more distinct with a few added seasons ended up with careers which were more difficult to distinguish. Perhaps most significantly, the Hall of Fame had instituted a rule at the beginning of the decade which was designed to ensure that the honor of selection was not exploited for profit as a mere gate attraction, and that players who were selected were not put into games long after their playing ability had waned simply to sell tickets; as a result, any individual who was still in uniform as a manager or coach – even at the minor league level – had been ruled ineligible for selection. (It is important to note that at the time, managers and coaches were widely regarded as being full members of the roster; playing managers and coaches were still very common, and even minor league managers not generally thought of as playing managers often inserted themselves into games in emergency situations.)\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1926 or later, but not after 1950. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nAny candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Votes were cast for 106 players; a total of 193 ballots were cast, with 145 votes required for election. A total of 1,599 individual votes were cast, an average of 8.28 per ballot.\nThe two candidates who received 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\"."

        "text": "The 94th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 30, 2010. It was the 15th Indy 500 sanctioned by the Indy Racing League, and was the premier event of the 2010 IZOD IndyCar Series season. The race was won by Dario Franchitti, ahead of Dan Wheldon and Marco Andretti. Tony Kanaan, who had started in the final position, ran as high as second during the race before finishing eleventh.\nThe race was the second of the three-year-long Centennial era, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the 100th anniversary of the first Indianapolis 500. It was the 53rd time the race had been held on a May 30. This year marked the first race with four female drivers (repeated in 2011), and Simona de Silvestro was awarded Rookie of the Year.\nSchedule.\nThe 2010 schedule was a two-week condensed schedule, but featured only one fewer day of on-track activity compared to 2009.\nQualifying.\nSunday May 23 – Bump Day.\nTime trials opened at 12:00 p.m., with several cars ready in the qualifying line. In the first hour, early runs filled the field to 33 cars. Several drivers put in safe speeds, including John Andretti, Sarah Fisher, Vítor Meira, Alex Lloyd, Bruno Junqueira. A. J. Foyt IV parted ways with his grandfather's team and Jaques Lazier was drafted as his replacement.\nAs of 1:00 p.m., the rear of the field consisted of the following drivers:\nAt about , a break in the qualifying line occurred, and the track was opened up for general practice. The temperature were rising into the low 90s °F, making it difficult to find speed out on the track. Most drivers stayed off the track during the hottest period of the afternoon, awaiting better conditions. At 5:23 p.m., Tony Kanaan took to the track in his repaired back-up car, and bumped his way into the field with a safe speed of . Kanaan's run bumped Sebastián Saavedra of Bryan Herta Autosport from the field. Saavedra experienced trouble of his own, as he wrecked his car during a practice run Sunday afternoon. Saavedra was sent to the hospital, and would be unable to re-qualify. As of 5:30 p.m., Romancini was now on the bubble.\nAs of approximately 5:30 p.m., the rear of the field consisted of the following drivers:\nMario Romancini withdrew his speed, and re-qualified, this time much faster. Jay Howard was now on the bubble. With twenty minutes remaining, Takuma Sato bumped Howard from the field. Paul Tracy now found himself on the bubble. With only fifteen minutes left in the day, the rear of the field consisted of the following drivers:\nJay Howard attempted to bump his way back in the field, but his run of was too slow. Paul Tracy still clung to the 33rd position. In a surprising move, he withdrew his speed at 5:50 p.m. Tracy hoped to put in a safer speed, and prevent Howard from getting another chance to qualify. Tracy's withdraw re-instated Sebastián Saavedra to the 33rd position. Tracy, however, got very loose in the hot conditions, and his speed ended up being slower. He waved off after only two laps, and hurriedly got back into the qualifying line. After quick wave-offs by Jaques Lazier and Milka Duno, the clock was running out. Sensing they were finally safe, Tony Kanaan's crew pulled their car out of line. Howard moved back to the front of the qualifying line with Tracy second in line.\nWith just minutes until the close of qualifying, the rear of the field consisted of the following drivers:\nWith two minutes left in the day, Jay Howard made his third and final attempt, in order to keep Tracy off the track. Howard's effort, however, was slower than the bubble speed. The 6 o'clock gun fired with Tracy still waiting in line. When Tracy withdrew his earlier attempt (), Sebastián Saavedra's car was re-instated to 33rd position, and he held on to make the field, while lying in a hospital bed. For the shoestring budget Bryan Herta Autosport team, the day was remembered as the \"Bump Day Miracle\".\nMilka Duno made three attempts during the day, and none were run to completion. Jaques Lazier, who took over at the Foyt team, found little speed in his three attempts, and also missed the field. Howard and Tracy, however, were the heartbreak stories of the day. After qualifying closed, Andretti Autosport decided to replace Tony Kanaan's qualified back-up car with the primary machine. The decision forced Kanaan to move to the 33rd position, but since he had qualified 32nd, it was a drop of only one spot on the grid.\nStarting grid.\nFailed to qualify\nRace summary.\nStart.\nAfter the traditional starting command by Mari Hulman George, the pace car, driven by Robin Roberts, led the cars through the pace laps, followed by a special two-seater car driven by Michael Andretti and carrying Mark Wahlberg. Once the pace car came off the field, the two-seater sped around to join the back of the field, and honorary starter Jack Nicholson waved the green flag to start the race. (Nicholson refused to leave the flagstand and waved the green flag on the first two restarts, on laps 5 and 12.)\nOn the first lap, Davey Hamilton spun on turn two, bringing out the yellow flag. Hamilton blamed Tomas Scheckter, who had narrowly passed Hamilton on the outside, forcing Hamilton to correct. \"Tomas Scheckter's an idiot... You know, he does it every year. I mean, it's not a surprise with him, and he gets away with it,\" said Hamilton. In just the half-lap of green-flag racing, however, Dario Franchitti had taken the lead, while Tony Kanaan had moved from the 33rd, final starting position to 25th.\nThe race returned to green-flag racing on lap 5, but a spin by Bruno Junqueira brought out another caution for laps 8–11. By this time, Kanaan had moved up to 17th.\nFirst half.\nFranchitti held the lead for a long period of green-flag racing, until Will Power passed him for the lead on lap 31. However, on a pit stop, Power left before the fuel hose had been completely detached, leaving a coil dangling from his car. This would lead to a pit drive-through penalty for Power, dropping Power to 25th, as well as a caution period for debris as part of the coil fell onto the track. While Power would repeatedly work his way towards the front of the field, additional pit problems later in the race would lead to only an 8th-place finish.\nFranchitti would maintain his lead beyond the halfway point of the race. Meanwhile, John Andretti spun into the wall on lap 65, and on the ensuing round of yellow-flag pit stops, both Scott Dixon and Raphael Matos lost wheels while pulling out and had to return to their pits. Kanaan improved eight spots, from 12th to 4th, on the same round of pit stops. Matos's race did not last much longer, as he spun into the wall on lap 73.\nSecond half.\nVítor Meira hit the turn two wall in lap 106, bringing out the race's next caution. Ed Carpenter, who had been running well, had to come into the pits before they were officially open to avoid running out of fuel, but the rules then required him to come in again once the pits were open, costing him several spots. While most drivers came into the pits on the yellow, Tomas Scheckter stayed out, briefly taking the lead, but Franchitti quickly took it back after the race returned to green-flag status.\nA long stretch of green-flag racing followed. Kanaan passed Hélio Castroneves and Scheckter to take the second spot, but Franchitti pulled away and had a lead of 9.7 seconds over Kanaan by lap 142. A series of green-flag pits on laps 143–147 resulted in Marco Andretti and Ryan Briscoe briefly taking the lead, in turn, before they had to pit and Franchitti re-emerged as the leader, with Andretti Autosport teammates Andretti and Kanaan in second and third, respectively. On the same round of pits, Castroneves stalled his car leaving the pits, dropping him from third to sixteenth. Continuing Penske Racing's problems, Briscoe crashed into the turn four wall on lap 148. Most drivers stayed out during this caution, but Castroneves pitted, hoping that there would be enough additional laps under caution to extend his fuel mileage and allow him to finish the race without pitting again. Kanaan passed Andretti under the following green flag to retake the second position.\nFinish.\nA spin by rookie Sebastián Saavedra on lap 161 brought out another caution, and most drivers came into the pits, but Mike Conway, Justin Wilson, Castroneves, and Graham Rahal all stayed out, taking the top four spots, respectively. In the end, none of the four had enough fuel to complete the race and all had to pit before the end of the race under a green flag, giving Franchitti the lead again on lap 192, with Kanaan again in second. Kanaan's hopes for a \"worst-to-first\" race came to an end on lap 196 when he had to come in for additional fuel.\nFranchitti slowed in the final laps to conserve fuel, but he was still able to stay ahead of second-place Dan Wheldon, who was also trying to save fuel. A dramatic crash occurred in the final lap as Ryan Hunter-Reay ran out of fuel and slowed, and Mike Conway hit Hunter-Reay's car, flipping Conway's car and sending it airborne and into the protective fence, shattering the car. Conway's teammate Ana Beatriz spun into the inside wall while avoiding the crash ahead of her. This brought out a final caution, and Franchitti led the field to the checkered flag, winning his second Indianapolis 500.\nConway was airlifted to nearby Methodist Hospital with a broken lower left leg. Of the crash, Hunter-Reay said, \"I'm sorry Mike is hurt... It was totally uncalled for. We weren't going to make it anyway. When you run out of fuel in these cars, it's like hitting the brakes. In hindsight, we should have stopped for fuel.\" It was the only multi-car crash of the race. Two spectators were treated for minor injuries from the crash. ESPN SportsCenter and ESPN'S NASCAR Now program reported on May 31, 2010 Conway also suffered compression to his lower back and suffered a bad fracture to one of his vertebrae in his neck.\n After skulling the traditional bottle of milk for the winner, Franchitti stated \"this tastes just as good the second time\", referring to his victory in the 2007 race. Franchitti led for 155 of the race's 200 laps. He survived the final 36 laps without taking a pit stop.\nPost-race summary.\nFranchitti's team's owner, Chip Ganassi had already won the Daytona 500 with Jamie McMurray. When McMurray won the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis, Ganassi became the first owner to win the Daytona 500, Indy 500, and Brickyard 400 in the same season. The Harley J. Earl Trophy had been brought to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway—the first time it had ever been away from Daytona—and it stood side by side with the Borg-Warner Trophy.\nDan Wheldon finished second. In a post-race interview, he suggested that it was a mistake to be as conservative as he was on fuel: \"I could see [Franchitti] at the end... unfortunately, I should have kept going 'cause I had fuel in the car when it came into the pits.\" However, Franchitti also had additional fuel, with 1.6 gallons remaining in his tank at the end of the race, even after taking a cool-down lap. It was the second consecutive second-place finish for Wheldon at the Indianapolis 500, and, along with Vítor Meira's finish in 2008, the third for Panther Racing.\nMarco Andretti was initially reported to have finished sixth, but a post-race review revealed that three drivers had passed him during the final caution period, and he was restored to third place in the official race results, giving him his third top-three finish in five starts at the Indianapolis 500. The same review also revealed that Simona de Silvestro passed Mario Romancini after the caution came out, making Romancini, not de Silvestro, the highest finishing rookie, at 13th. Marco Andretti was one of the three Andretti Autosport drivers (out of the team's five entries) to finish in the top eleven, even though none of the Andretti drivers had qualified higher than sixteenth. As late as lap 191, four of the Andretti drivers had been in the top nine. Also among the Andretti drivers was Danica Patrick; starting twenty-third and finishing sixth, she scored the highest placement of the four female drivers in the race.\nHélio Castroneves, who started from the pole and was considered a pre-race favorite, finished ninth after his problematic pit stop, and his late-race fuel strategy failed to pan out. Castroneves praised Franchitti and took responsibility for his own finish, saying \"I have to say, Dario was dominant. But this was the first time I feel like I let my guys down. We didn't have the best car, but we were better than ninth, certainly.\"\nTony Kanaan, who had started in last place and had run as high as second, finished eleventh after he had to pit for a final splash of fuel, but still garnered much applause from nearby fans as he exited his car after the race. Kanaan praised former teammate Franchitti: \"The best car and the best driver today won the race.\"\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\n(*) Lloyd, Dixon, Patrick, and de Silvestro's finishing positions were adjusted downward after the race, for passing under yellow.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe race was televised in high definition in the United States on ABC, the 46th consecutive year on that network. Marty Reid served as anchor. The telecast utilized the Side-by-Side format for commercial breaks.\n\"Fast Friday\" Practice, Time trials, and Carb Day were shown live in high definition on Versus. Bob Jenkins served as anchor, along with Robbie Buhl and Jon Beekhuis as analysts. Jack Arute, Robbie Floyd, and Lindy Thackston covered the pits.\nThe race was carried live on TSN and on RDS in Canada, and on ESPN Latin America. In Brazil, the race was carried live on Band TV/BandSports.\nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the IMS Radio Network. Mike King served as anchor. For the second time, Paul Page and Bob Jenkins joined the booth to offer commentary and observations. For the first time, the turn one reporting location was eliminated. Jerry Baker instead joined the booth as analyst. The turn one vantage point was eliminated due to the fact that the booth announcers had a clear view of that part of the track, and it allowed better continuity.\nThe driver expert was Indy Lights competitor James Hinchcliffe, who joined the crew for the first time. For the fourth year in a row, Davey Hamilton was part of the crew serving as live in-car reporter. However, he was involved in a crash at the start of the race, and was unable to give any reports. He instead visited the booth during the race.\nChris Denari, the television voice of the Indiana Fever, covered a Fever game against the Shock Saturday night before the race in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He then drove ten hours overnight back to Indianapolis to make it to the race on time.\nFor 2010, a special change was made for the famous out-cue \"Stay tuned for the greatest spectacle in racing.\" Rather than just have the chief announcer recite the line, numerous drivers from the starting field were recorded introducing themselves and reciting the cue. Each commercial break attempted to feature a different driver."

And calling me a drunk! Is he serious? He loves a drink. Everyone knows that. If you can put that in the paper, then put it in the paper. I used to have nothing but respect for the guy until I heard that. But that's it.\" In 2012, Laurie and Mason played for the same team, the Newcastle Knights.\nWyong Roos.\nIn 2013, Laurie joined stand-alone NSW Cup team, Wyong Roos.

However, when Love reached the final green with the tournament wrapped up, the sun peaked through the clouds and a rainbow appeared in the sky. Many took it as a symbol of Love finally winning his first major after several close calls and of his late father, a PGA professional, approvingly looking down from above.\nLove's performance is remembered as one of the best in modern major championship history. Only two players finished within 10 shots of him. The sports analytics expert Bill Barnwell statistically identified the victory as the second most dominant win of the modern era (1960–2011), only behind Tiger Woods' 15-shot triumph at the 2000 U.S. Open.\nThis was the first PGA Championship at the West Course and the fifth major; it previously hosted four U.S. Opens (1929, 1959, 1974, and 1984), which later returned in 2006 and 2020.

It was organised by Brazilian sports agency Koch Tavares (one of the founding partners of Beach Soccer Worldwide).\nThe tournament took place at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The hosts and heavy favourites Brazil won the tournament by beating the United States 8–1 in the final, coming from behind to claim their first world title.\nThe tournament was immediately deemed a success, leading to the instant scheduling of a second World Cup the following year.\nThe event was notable for featuring many high-profile ex-association footballers, fuelling its popularity, including the likes of the Brazilians Zico, Júnior and Cláudio Adão, Italian 1982 World Cup winners Alessandro Altobelli and Claudio Gentile, Franco Causio, England's Gary Stevens and Luther Blissett, and brothers René and Willy van de Kerkhof of the Netherlands' 1978 World Cup runners-up squad.\nBackground.\nIn 1994, Koch Tavares organised the first international beach soccer competition in Brazil, the \"Mundialito de beach soccer\", a small 4-team event, in view of understanding how commercially successful beach soccer could be in the region. It featured Brazil, Argentina, Italy and the United States and was dubbed an \"unofficial World Cup\". The Mundialito was deemed a huge success, which gave Koch Tavares the incentive to organise a fully-fledged international competition. This conception materialised a year later in 1995 as this, the maiden Beach Soccer World Championships – a larger and longer eight team event compared to the Mundialito.\nOrganisation.\nFormat\nThe following format was decided upon by the organisers for the maiden edition of the championships: the eight participating nations competed in two groups of four teams in a round robin format. The top two teams progressed straight to the semi-finals from which point on the championship was played as a knock-out tournament until a winner was crowned with an additional match to determine third place.\nMiscellaneous\nThe launch of the tournament took place from 12:30 onwards on January 18 at the Rio Internacional Hotel which involved the press and guests attending to see the opening presentation of the World Championships as well as explanations of the rules of the newly founded sport and the tournament's schedule. Furthermore, the Brazilian team was also revealed to the press and engaged in interviews.\nThe presence of Zico as part of the Brazilian squad, who made over 70 appearances for the Brazilian national association football team, gained considerable attention in the local press prior to the start of the championship. Zico revealed at the launch he accepted an invitation from his friend and Brazilian team captain, Júnior, to play at the event, despite claiming to be \"out of shape\" now aged 41, having retired from football a year earlier.\nFollowing the launch, official training for the World Championships began the next day on January 19 on pitches external to the beach arena, in front of Copacabana Palace, concluding with training sessions inside the arena on January 23.\nThe draw to split the eight teams into Groups A and B was conducted on January 21 at the Rio Internacional Hotel. Brazil and Argentina were allocated as heads of the two respective groups, with the other six teams then drawn to accompany them.\nThe Championships were part of the (\"Festival Olímpico de Verão\"), taking place in the Copacabana beach arena with a capacity of 12,000. Entry to all games was free of charge for fans.\nIn total, US$1 million (1.6 million in 2017) was invested into the organisation of the tournament, including payment for the players who participated.\nTeams.\nThere was no qualification process for the first Beach Soccer World Championships; nations were simply invited to play. However, such invites were \"not\" random – specific nations were summoned.\nKoch Tavares, the tournament organisers, decided that as the first \"World Cup\" of beach soccer, since the sport is a derivative of association football, it would be fitting for the six winners of the FIFA World Cup of football throughout history (as of 1995) to field a team in Rio (being hosts Brazil, Argentina, Italy, Uruguay, England and Germany) and as such the aforementioned nations were invited to play, all of which accepted the opportunity.\nTo make up the numbers, the Netherlands and the United States, despite having never won a FIFA World Cup title, were also invited as \"guests\".\nAfrica, Asia and Oceania were unrepresented.\nEuropean Zone (4):\nNorth American Zone (1):\nSouth American Zone (2):\nHosts:\nKnockout stage.\nJanuary 27 was allocated as a rest day."

He was the head coach of the Chapman Panthers (1993), the Kentucky Wildcats (2009–2016) and Mississippi State Bulldogs (2018).\nPlaying career.\nHenderson pitched one year at Linfield College before transferring to San Diego State University, compiling a 19–5 career record at the two schools.\nCoaching career.\nHenderson started coaching at his alma mater, San Diego State, as the junior varsity head coach. He had assistant coaching stints at Cal State Fullerton, Riverside Community College, Chapman College (served as head coach for 1 season), and Pepperdine.\nHenderson became an assistant at Florida in 1995. Following a trip to the 1996 College World Series, he was named the National Assistant Coach of the Year by Collegiate Baseball newspaper.

On 28 October, two tries by Mal Meninga inspire St. Helens, to beat Wigan 26–18, and win the Lancashire County Cup for the first time in 16 years.\nThe 1985 Man of Steel Award went to Bradford Northern utility back, Ellery Hanley. He also became the first man to score more than 50 tries in a season since Billy Boston, and the first non-winger to reach this figure for 70 years.\nThe increase of the Second Division to 20 teams meant that it would have taken 38 rounds to play out a full double round robin, which was considered too many matches, so a complicated fixture formula was used to reduce it to 28. For this season, Huyton relocated and were renamed Runcorn Highfield, Cardiff City Blue Dragons relocated and were renamed Bridgend Blue Dragons, and Kent Invicta relocated and were renamed were Southend Invicta, Huddersfield were renamed Huddersfield Barracudas, and Mansfield Marksman, and Sheffield Eagles joined the Second Division. As of 2017, 11th in the Second Division is the lowest position that Wakefield Trinity have ever finished.\nSt. Helens beat Wigan 26–18 to win the Lancashire County Cup, and Hull F.C. beat Hull Kingston Rovers 29–12 to win the Yorkshire County Cup.\nChampionship.\nHull Kingston Rovers finished on top of the First Division table to claim their fifth championship.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe 1984–85 Silk Cut Challenge Cup was won by Wigan after defeating Hull F.C. in the final.\nThe Final was played on 4 May at Wembley before a crowd of 99,801 and is arguably the greatest ever in Challenge Cup history. Just after half-time Hull were 22 – 8 down before staging a fight back, but Wigan held on to win 28–24, ushering in an era of dominance for the club."

It is a form of gridiron football. In the United States, the game is most often referred to as simply \"football\".\nOrganization in the United States.\nBefitting its status as a popular sport, football is played in leagues of different size, age and quality, in all regions of the country. A team / academy may be referred to as a \"football program\".\nThere is no single national governing body for American football in the United States or a continental governing body for North America. There is an international governing body, the International Federation of American Football, or IFAF.\nThe governing body for American football in the United States is USA Football.\nProfessional.\nNFL.\nThe 32-team National Football League (NFL) is currently the only major American football league in the United States. There have been numerous attempts over the past several decades to create a second major or high-level professional league, most of which failed within a few years or, in the cases of the All-America Football Conference and 1960s American Football League, merged with the NFL. The National Football League has the highest revenue and average attendance of any sports league in the world.\nThe NFL has not operated any developmental minor leagues since the folding of the NFL Europe League in 2007. There are some \"independent\" leagues operating in the US, but they are not overseen by the NFL and the teams has no affiliation to NFL franchises.\nMinor leagues.\nThe United Football League is the predominant professional spring football league. It consists of two four-team conferences, the XFL and the USFL, that originally were founded and played as separate eight-team leagues in 2020 and 2022 respectively before agreeing to a merger with each other. Both conferences bear the names of leagues before them: the USFL was named after a 1980s major professional league known as the United States Football League and reached a settlement with the remaining rightsholders to that league; the XFL was a revival of a 2001 league of the same name from the same founder, Vince McMahon, who sold the league and brand after the 2020 season.\nOther active minor league are the Gridiron Developmental Football League and the Rivals Professional Football League which are viewed as low-level or semi-pro leagues.\nIndoor American football leagues.\nThere are several professional and semi-professional indoor American football leagues, played at hockey-sized arenas. The largest and oldest operating leagueis the Indoor Football League which has 13 teams spanning from Ohio to California. Historically the Arena Football League, which launched in 1987 was the most prominent league but as the league had operational issues following its 2008 bankruptcy, teams folded and left for other leagues before the Arena Football League folded in 2019.\nOther pro leagues, which are regional in nature, are the National Arena League which includes several former AFL teams, and the Champions Indoor Football which are viewed as second-tier leagues; and the American Indoor Football Alliance, American Arena League and American West Football Conference which are third-tier or semi-pro leagues.\nIndoor football leagues play by significantly different rules that accommodate a smaller field of play.\nOther professional gridiron football leagues.\nSome American players go to Canada and play in the Canadian Football League, which operates professionally on a somewhat older rule system with a number of differences from the American game but still recognizable as \"football\" to the casual American football observer. The CFL allocates half of its teams' rosters for players born and raised in Canada but allows the rest of the players to be foreign born (in practice, these spots are almost always filled by Americans); the CFL also has television presence in the United States and as recently as 1995 played games in the U.S.\nUniversity and collegiate.\nCollege football is also popular throughout North America. Most of college football in the United States is governed by the NCAA. Many colleges and universities have football teams, often with dedicated football stadiums. These teams mostly play other similarly sized schools, through the NCAA's divisional system, which divides collegiate sports teams into four divisions (I-FBS, I-FCS, II and III). The largest, most popular collegiate teams routinely fill stadiums larger than 75,000. Eight college football stadiums—the University of Michigan's Michigan Stadium, Penn State's Beaver Stadium, Ohio State's Ohio Stadium, Texas A&amp;M's Kyle Field, the University of Tennessee's Neyland Stadium, LSU's Tiger Stadium, Alabama's Bryant–Denny Stadium, and Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium at the University of Texas at Austin—seat more than 100,000 fans and usually sell out. The weekly autumn ritual of college football includes marching bands, cheerleaders, homecoming, parties, the tailgate party; it forms an important part of the culture in much of small-town America. Football is a major source of revenue to the athletic programs of schools, public and private, in the United States. Top college football players enter the NFL Draft after their college careers are over, in hopes of signing with an NFL team.\n\"FBS\" and \"FCS\" are abbreviations for the Football Bowl Subdivision and Football Championship Subdivision, two sections of Division I that exist only in football. These two subdivisions were formerly known as Divisions I-A and I-AA respectively. The Championship Subdivision, consisting mostly of smaller schools than the FBS but larger than D-II, has a multiple-round playoff system just like Divisions II and III, while the Bowl Subdivision has only a limited, and unofficial, four-team playoff and has historically only featured division championships and bowl games. FBS and FCS teams can, and often do, play against each other. Unofficially, the Bowl Subdivision is divided into two further subdivisions, \"major conferences\" (also known as \"Power Five conferences\") and \"mid-majors\" (known in modern parlance as the \"Group of Five\"). In practice, only major conference teams are eligible to compete for the national championship and receive significant favor in the opinion polling over mid-majors, and it was not until the addition of the BCS National Championship Game that mid-majors had a realistic chance at appearing in one of the major bowls. Although the FCS has a playoff, three conferences do not participate (the Ivy League does not allow its teams to play in the postseason, and the historically black SWAC and MEAC instead play each other in a bowl of their own). Division III teams do not offer scholarships to their players; two Division I FCS leagues also do not offer scholarships—the Ivy League, which prohibits athletic scholarships in any sport, and the Pioneer Football League, which only competes in football and whose members all offer scholarships in non-football sports.\nWith the exception of the annual Army–Navy Game, only Power Five conference teams air on national broadcast television, although mid-majors, FCS teams, D-II and D-III games can see more limited coverage on cable and local television.\nThough the NCAA is the most publicized college athletic organization, the NAIA (which houses mostly smaller private colleges in the midwest), NJCAA (an association for community colleges), and California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA) (that state's equivalent to the NJCAA) also sanction football games. There also exists a club football circuit for student-run teams and colleges that choose not to compete at the varsity level. In addition to this, 10 colleges field teams in the Collegiate Sprint Football League, a league in which all players must weigh no more than in order to be eligible to play; four of those teams are long-established sprint teams that co-exist alongside their NCAA counterparts (two from the Ivy League and two military academies), while six teams that have been added since the CSFL began an ongoing expansion in 2008 either never had a varsity squad (one recent addition, 2015 expansion team Chestnut Hill College, was an all-women's school that did not even admit men until 2003) or downgraded from an NCAA team to a sprint team.\nHigh school.\nMost American high schools field football teams. High school football is popular; top schools regularly fill stadiums holding over 10,000 fans, and can afford artificial playing surfaces.\nHigh school teams generally play only against other teams from their state (notable exceptions include matchups between nearby schools located on opposite sides of a state line and occasional matchups between two nationally ranked teams for television purposes). Still, some private Christian high schools play for national championships through organizations like the Federated Christian Athletic Association. Public high school football in most states, as is the case with other high school sports, is governed by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS).\nFor rural schools that do not have the student body to support a full football team, the NFHS sanctions nine-man football (most popular in the upper Midwest), six-man football (most commonly used in Texas, although previously more widely popular and undergoing a minor revival elsewhere), and eight-man football (which the most common reduced-man format in most other states).\nAdult amateur football and semi-pro football.\nAdult amateur football, also known as semi-pro football, is a level of American football. It is commonly known as \"working man's\" football, meaning the players have regular jobs and play football on the weekends. Though the players do not get paid, the leagues and the games are run in a somewhat professional manner. For most leagues, it is against the rules to pay its players to play. The rules of the game are usually a hybrid of NFL and NCAA rules.\nThere are several different leagues, regional in nature, playing in the United States:\nSeveral leagues supporting women's semi-professional football play have existed. The current major league is the Women's Football Alliance (WFA). The WFA started to play in 2009 stocked with teams from two dissolved leagues, the National Women's Football Association and Women's Professional Football League (NWFA and WPFL respectively).\nOther codes.\nAmerican 7s Football League (A7FL) is a semi-professional league which plays a seven-man version of gridiron football, while the American Flag Football League plays a variant of American football where, instead of tackling players to the ground, the defensive team must remove a flag or flag belt from the ball carrier to end a down.\nUS National American football team.\nUSA Football assembles a national football team for competition in the IFAF World Championship every four years. Because of concerns over competitive balance, USA Football did not field teams for the first two events in 1999 and 2003. The 2007 team consisted solely of amateur players who had graduated from college that spring, from a diverse mix of smaller and larger colleges and universities. The 2011 squad's criteria were looser, allowing some professional players to play (mostly unemployed, lower-end and minor league players; no NFL or NCAA stars participated). Both the 2007 and 2011 incarnations of the team won their year's respective world championship.\nThe IFAF also fields an U-19 team composed of high school football players that has participated in the 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2016 junior world championships. The national U-19 team won the 2009 and 2014 contests but lost the 2012 contest to Canada.\nWomen's football in the United States.\nWomen's football teams in the United States have had many sports leagues. Among them are the Women's Professional Football League (1965–1973), the Women's Professional Football League, the Independent Women's Football League, the Women's Football Alliance, and the X League. In 1970, Patricia Palinkas became the holder of the Orlando Panthers and became the first woman to play in the Atlantic Coast Football League, and in 2010 Katie Hnida became the kicker for the Fort Wayne FireHawks in the Continental Indoor Football League."

An outfielder, Perry was born in New Bern, North Carolina, where he graduated from high school; he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nPerry signed with the New York Giants in 1953, but spent a decade in the club's farm system—never reaching the major leagues—until the relocated San Francisco Giants sold his contract to the Angels on May 16, 1963. Along the way, Perry had one season of 30 home runs, and four campaigns of 20 or more long balls.\nThe Angels immediately plugged Perry into their starting lineup at Yankee Stadium on May 17, 1963, and the 28-year-old rookie went one for four against Jim Bouton in a 4–3 loss. Perry got into 61 contests for the 1963 Angels, starting 23 games as the club's right fielder and 19 more as its center fielder. He batted .253 with 42 hits. In 1964, Perry appeared in 70 games, 55 as the starting center fielder, and improved his production to .276 in 221 at bats. He also spent part of the year at Triple-A Hawaii.\nBut 1964 was Perry's last MLB season. On February 1, 1965, the Angels traded him to the Pittsburgh Pirates for infielder Julio Gotay, and Perry spent the remainder of his pro career in the minors, where he hit over 200 lifetime home runs. He retired in 1970 as he neared his 36th birthday.\nAs a big-leaguer, Bob Perry collected 103 total hits, with 17 doubles and one triple to go along with his six home runs; he had 30 career runs batted in. During his brief MLB career, Perry had three three-hit games. On July 15, 1964, in the second game of a twi-night doubleheader, he had three hits and a base on balls in four plate appearances against the Detroit Tigers at Dodger Stadium; his solo home run in the eighth inning off Phil Regan provided the winning margin for eventual 1964 Cy Young Award-winner Dean Chance in a 1–0 Angel victory.\nPerry died in New Bern on July 2, 2017.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Cricket in the West Indies",
        "text": " \nIn the sport of cricket, the West Indies is a sporting confederation of fifteen mainly English-speaking Caribbean countries and territories, many of which historically formed the British West Indies. It consists of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, the British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Maarten, St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago and the United States Virgin Islands. The governing body for the confederation is Cricket West Indies (CWI), which is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC); beneath the CWI are six territorial governing bodies covering different nations and regions of the confederation. The CWI organises the West Indies cricket team, which represents the confederation in international cricket, as well as administering domestic cricket competitions across the West Indies.\nThe West Indies cricket team, nicknamed \"The Windies\", are one of the twelve Test cricket teams, having gained Test status in 1928. They were considered amongst the strongest Test teams from the 1960s, ushering a golden age in which they were undisputed champions for the latter part of the 1970s to the mid 1990s. In One Day International cricket, they have won the World Cup twice and the ICC Trophy once. They have also won the World Twenty20 twice.\nDomestic competitions organised across the whole of the West Indies include the Regional Four Day Competition (First-class), the Regional Super50 (List A) and the Caribbean Premier League (Twenty20).\nCricket is also played in other Caribbean territories such as the Cayman Islands, who are associate members of the ICC, whilst the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Belize, Suriname and Cuba are affiliate members. As such, these territories do not form part of the West Indies for cricketing purposes, and field their own separate national teams.\nOriginally introduced to the West Indies by British soldiers, cricket's popularity spread to the black population and it is traditionally considered one of the most popular team sport in the West Indies and a major part of West Indian culture, although others sports such as association football and basketball have challenged its popularity since the 1990s. Major international cricket competitions hosted by the West Indies include the 2007 World Cup and the 2010 World Twenty20.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nCricket originally spread to the West Indies via the British military. Military officials established cricket clubs, including the St. Annes Garrison Club, and integrated cricket pitches into garrisons in the Caribbean. The first known reference to cricket in the West Indies is believed to be from June 1806, in the \"Barbados Mercury and Bridgetown Gazette\". Two years later, a cricket match was held between the officers of the Royal West Indies Rangers and the officers of the Third West India Regiment. It is believed that the military was a major influencing force behind the drive to begin playing cricket porting this, there were known to be cricket pitches located in many garrisons all around the Caribbean.\nExpansion of cricket.\nDuring the period of colonial rule, cricket began to be played by the black population of the British West Indies. This adoption was a consequence of constant positive reinforcement from their masters for participating in activities that were familiar such as cricket, and abstaining from those that were perceived as taboo. Eventually, slaves were granted permission to play with military officers (who at one point only played cricket amongst themselves) in restricted roles. Foremost, they were allowed to prepare the wicket before matches, although some were permitted to bowl or retrieve batted balls.\nAs official cricket clubs began to form, some black players were given the opportunity to play for white-majority clubs. However, many cricket clubs remained exclusively white, which led black players to establish their own clubs that would only allow other blacks to join. Clubs such as the Barbados Cricket Committee (BCC), which was established in the late nineteenth century, adhered to the policy of an all-white team, while Jamaica's Melbourne Cricket Club was composed of only professional black cricketeers. The first inter-island competition took place in 1865 between Demerara and Barbados, at the Garrison Savannah. However, these matches were at first \"organized and played almost exclusively by whites.\" Over time, integrated matches became increasingly more common, as integrated cricket teams competed at first in an attempt to prove their dominance over the other teams of other colonies. Some segregation still existed, for instance the fact that black players were often excluded \"from clubhouse refreshment breaks during and after the game\". Gradually, blacks began to be employed on professional teams, marking the start of full racial integration in the sport.\nThe English were eager to promote cricket throughout the British Empire, and on 31 May 1926 the West Indian Cricket Board, along with their New Zealand and Indian counterparts, was elected to the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC), which previously consisted of the English and representatives of Australia and South Africa. Election to full membership of the ICC meant the West Indies could play official Test matches, which is the designation given to the most important international games, and the Windies became the fourth team actually to play a recognised Test match on 23 June 1928 when they took on England at Lord's in London. \nSocietal impact.\nCricket has traditionally been the most popular sport in the West Indies, both before and after independence. The inclusion of black players into West Indian cricket teams marked a moment of racial integration in West Indian society. Talented black players helped to overturn existing attitudes of white superiority. Cricket helped to serve a dual purpose for the West Indies- before slavery was abolished in 1833, cricket was considered as a constructive pastime for blacks. In that same time period, it was also considered a way for the whites to exhibit their loyalty to the Crown. \nTwo noteworthy West Indian cricketers are George Headley, who captained the West Indies in the first test against the touring MCC team in 1947-48, and Barbadian Sir Frank Worrell, who was captain of the West Indies team against Australia in 1960-61. In 2009, Both Headley and Worrell were inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. The early 1970s to mid-1990s showed a major increase in the dominance of the West Indian cricket team. The general historical consensus is that this is due to an increase in fast bowling, backed up by some of the best batsmen in the world. In 1976, fast bowler Michael Holding took 14/149 in the OvalTest against England, setting a record which still stands for best bowling figures in a Test by a West Indies bowler.\nGoverning body.\nThe West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) is the governing body for professional and amateur cricket in the West Indies. It was originally formed in the early 1920s as the West Indies Cricket Board of Control (and is still sometimes referred by that name), but changed its name in 1996. The Board has its headquarters in St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda.\nThe WICB has been a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1926 and is also a member of Americas Cricket Association. It operates the West Indies cricket team and West Indies A cricket team, organising Test tours and one-day internationals with other teams.\nDomestic competition.\nThe West Indies' major domestic competitions are the Regional Four Day Competition (First-class competition) and the NAGICO Regional Super50 (List A one-day competition) and more recently the Caribbean Premier League (domestic Twenty20 competition – replacing the Caribbean T20, which in turn replaced the Stanford 20/20 that had been financed and organized by Sir Allen Stanford).\nOther domestic competitions include the TCL Under-19 West Indies Challenge (three-day competition), TCL Under-19 West Indies Challenge Limited Overs Series (one-day limited overs competition), CLICO West Indies Under-15 competition and the WIWCF Women's Senior Tournament. One prominent former competition (not originally organized by the WICB) was the Inter-Colonial Tournament.\nIn the case of the Regional Four Day Competition and the NAGICO Super50 (and formerly in the case of the Caribbean Twenty20) the following first-class domestic teams participate:\nFor the NAGICO Super50, the following domestic teams still participate:\nFor the TCL Under-19 West Indies Challenge (both the three-day and limited overs competitions) it is the Under-19 squads for these teams which participate, while for the CLICO Under-15 West Indies tournament it is the Under-15 squads for these teams which participate. In the 2004 TCL Under-19 Challenge the Under-19 Bermuda cricket team and an Under-19 combined Americas cricket team also took part.\nIn the WIWCF Senior Tournament and in the defunct Stanford 20/20 competition the separate components of the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands compete individually. Additionally for the Stanford 20/20 competition teams from outside the West Indies sporting confederation, but within the Caribbean, also compete including the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Cuba (which was barred from competing in 2008 by the U.S. embargo), the Turks and Caicos Islands (both competing in 2008) as well as the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico (announced for the 2009 edition of the Stanford 20/20).\nIn the Caribbean Premier League there are franchise teams competing, with each franchise currently representing one of the six traditional cricketing territories in the West Indies:\nIn December 2022, the CWI introduced a new first-class cricket competition, called Headley Weekes Tri-Series.\nRepresentative teams.\nThe West Indies cricket team, also known colloquially as The Windies or The West Indies, is a multi-national cricket team representing a sporting confederation of the West Indies.\nThe \"Windies\" is one of the twelve elite international teams that play at the Test match cricket-level.\nThe West Indies women's cricket team made its Test debut in 1976 and its ODI debut in 1979."

        "text": "Thomas James Hamilton (December 26, 1905 – April 3, 1994) was an American football player, coach, college athletics administrator, and naval aviator who rose to the rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy. He was the head coach at the United States Naval Academy from 1934 to 1936 and again from 1946 to 1947 and at the University of Pittsburgh in 1951 and 1954, compiling a career college football record of 28–32–1.\nHamilton was also the athletic director at the Naval Academy from 1948 to 1948 and at Pittsburgh from 1949 to 1959. From 1959 to 1971, he was the commissioner of the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU), renamed the Pacific-8 Conference in 1968 and now the Pac-12 Conference. Hamilton was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1965.\nEarly life and playing career.\nBorn in Hoopeston, Illinois, Hamilton attended high school in Columbus and Granville, Ohio. He attended the United States Naval Academy, graduating in 1927, and was a key player on the 1926 football squad that won a national championship with a 9–0–1 record. The single blemish on that season was a tie with Army, a game which has been described as \"one of the greatest football games ever played.\" He was also elected as class president during his time at the academy.\nMilitary career.\nFollowing graduation from Annapolis and commissioning as an ensign, Hamilton served the required period in surface ships before applying for flight training. He qualified as a naval aviator and flew a variety of aircraft, including patrol planes from San Diego in 1938 and 1939.\nDuring World War II, Hamilton served ashore and afloat, primarily in aviation training and aboard the aircraft carrier . He was her flight deck officer and executive officer in 1943 and 1944, commanding the ship during a brief refit in 1944.\nCoaching and sports administration career.\nIn 1934, Hamilton became the 21st head football coach at his alma mater, and served as head coach at Navy for a total of five years—three years in his first stint from 1934 through 1936 and two more in 1946 and 1947. Hamilton moved on to become athletic director at Navy in 1948, a position which he held for two years before leaving to accept a similar position at the University of Pittsburgh, serving there until 1959. Twice during his tenure at Pitt, in 1951 and 1954, he also was the head coach of the football team.\nHamilton left Pitt in 1959 to take on the role of founding commissioner of the new Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU), which later became the Pacific-8 Conference and eventually the Pac-12 Conference, a position which he held until 1971. He served as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness, served 16 years on the U.S Olympic Committee, and was vice-president of the National Football Foundation.\nAwards.\nHamilton received the Theodore Roosevelt Award from the NCAA, the Stagg Award from the American Football Coaches Association, the Gold Medal from the National Football Foundation, the Corbett Award from the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics and the James Lynah Award from the Eastern College Athletic Conference. In 1976, he was inducted into the San Diego Hall of Champions.\nPersonal life.\nHamilton was married to Emmie Spalding in 1932 and is buried in the Naval Academy cemetery."

        "text": "The Grover Cleveland Golf Course is a historic golf course located in Buffalo, New York that hosted the 1912 U.S. Open that was founded as The Country Club of Buffalo. It is one of two courses owned by Erie County.\nCourse.\nThe golf course is located at 3781 Main Street. The 18-hole course is (from the back tees) and is a par 69. It has a course rating of 65.5 and a slope rating of 102.\nHistory.\nThe course was founded as The Country Club of Buffalo on February 11, 1889, and was originally located at the intersection of Elmwood Avenue and Nottingham Terrace, near the present-day Delaware Park and SUNY–Buffalo State College. After purchasing the 1823 Samuel Schenck House, which included the Old Stone House, farm and orchard at 3781 Main St, they moved from their site on Elmwood Ave. The CCB built the original club house, polo field, archery field, tennis courts and lastly the 18 hole golf course. Noted architect E.B. Green designed the first clubhouse, which opened in August 1889.\nIn 1899, the club relocated to make way for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition. The clubhouse became the Women's Center during the Pan-American Exposition. The club acquired land at the intersection of Main Street at Bailey Avenue at the City of Buffalo’s border with the Town of Amherst. The club began construction of a golf course at that time and constructed a clubhouse on the site in 1901. George Cary, who also designed the landmarked Buffalo History Museum, designed the clubhouse. The 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, and a polo field were completed in 1902. In 1910, A.L. Pfitzner, a pilot from Curtiss, made the first airplane flight in Western New York from the club's grounds. In 1910 and 1911, Walter J. Travis renovated the course in anticipation of attracting a major golf tournament.\nIn 1912, the course hosted the 1912 U.S. Open, won by the defending champion, 20-year-old John J. McDermott, Jr., still the youngest-ever champion and the first American to win the title. McDermott won the tournament with a score of 283.\nSale.\nIn 1922, the Country Club of Buffalo began acquiring new property, and in 1925, the existing course was sold to the City of Buffalo for $800,000. In 1926, the club completed its relocation to its present location in the Town of Amherst at 250 Youngs Road in Williamsville, New York.\nWhen the club moved to its present location in Amherst, the existing site was renamed Grover Cleveland Park to honor the former Mayor of Buffalo, Governor of New York, and President of the United States. It was at this time, that the Main St. property was rezoned from being part of Amherst, NY to becoming part of Buffalo, NY.\nThe present course has hosted the U.S. Women's Amateur in 1931, the Curtis Cup in 1950, the Carling Cup Matches in 1960, and the National Junior Girls Championship in 1962.\nCountry Club of Buffalo.\nThe transported Country Club of Buffalo, located in the Town of Amherst is a (from the back tees), par 72 Donald J. Ross, ASGCA designed golf course also opened in 1926. The course rating is 71.8 and it has a slope rating of 127 on Bent grass. Timothy P. Minahan, CCM manages the course as the general manager. The clubhouse, which overlooks the eighteenth green, was designed by Duane Lyman and opened in 1927."

        "text": "Brief history.\nIn 1897 Captain John Howard bought Sibton Park House and its surrounding estate. He was the owner of Chartham Paper Mills and a Member of Parliament. Records show that cricket was played on this ground in the 1880s but the club was formed under the patronage of John Howard in 1903. Cricket has been played continuously since then with the exception of the periods during the two World Wars. In the 1930s, cricket weeks were held at the Park, marquees erected and this became very much a part of the social life of the village and the surrounding area.\nDevelopment.\nAfter the second World War the club slowly developed though funds and resources were scarce. The skills of the club members were put to good use in improving the ground and pavilion facilities. A small wooden pavilion with no electricity, mains water or mains drainage progressed to a purpose-built brick pavilion.\nCricket.\nIn the 1960s it was decided that the club could field an occasional and XI. A little later a Colts section was started (the first in the Folkestone and Hythe area). The club fields two Saturday and two Sunday sides with mid-week cricket and Junior cricket in several age groups. The 1st XI has just gained promotion to the 1st Division of the Kent League and the second XI was promoted to the 2nd Division in 2003.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1998 a new net practice facility was built with two full-sized double nets (with help from the National Lottery). The winter of 2000/2001 saw the ground and pavilion under several feet of water for six months. The pavilion was re-furbished and cricket was played on the late May Bank Holiday. The following autumn a comprehensive drainage and pumping system was installed to prevent flooding happening again. In 2003 the club celebrated its centenary with a Cricket week which included a game against the MCC.\nIn 2004, the club became the first sports club in Folkestone and Hythe and only third cricket club in Kent to be awarded the ECB and Sport England Clubmark\n and in 2006 became one of the county's first Focus Clubs. In 2007 the ground was extended to accommodate a larger Junior section and a new Girls' section."

The league consists of sixteen teams who are categorized into two conferences based on the geographical location. These conferences are Savannah and the Atlantic. \nFormat.\nThe league usually spans from March till mid year. Each team plays a total of 14 games in a regular season after which the top four teams qualify for the Final Eight Playoffs which usually takes place at the National Stadium Surulere Lagos. The team at the bottom of the table in each conference is relegated from the league. Towards the end of the year, the Division 1 Championship is held to determine who will be promoted to the DSTV League for the new season. In the 2014 season, Royal Hoopers of Rivers State and Niger Potter of Nigers State were both relegated from the Atlantic and Savannah Conference respectively. Accordingly, the Delta Force and FCT Rocks were promoted to the league having won the Division 1 Championship in November 2014.\nAmendments were made to the schedule of events this season. At the end of the season, the top six teams from each conference will play conference playoffs to determine the winner of each conference before the top four of each conference will play the Final Eight Playoffs to determine the league winner. This is to increase the number of games played by each team in a particular season.\nHistory.\nThe Nigerian Premier League was founded in 1995.\nIn 2017, Nigeria Basketball Federation reached an agreement with Kwese Sports for the title rights of the league.

FIBA rules prohibit governments from intervening in federations, which is why the championship was ruled illegitimate. As a result, the 2021 champions Rivers Hoopers were excluded from participation in the 2022 BAL season.\nSponsorships.\nFor sponsorship reasons the league has known several names in its existence. The league was sponsored by the DSTV until 2017, who had both title and TV rights through the contract agreement.

Noted amateur Bobby Jones, winner of the British Open two weeks earlier, won the second of his four U.S. Opens, one stroke ahead of runner-up Joe Turnesa.\nAfter rounds of 70-79-71, Jones was three strokes behind third round leader Turnesa, who unraveled on the last nine on Saturday afternoon, with five bogeys in six holes. He managed to birdie the final hole for a 77 and 294 total for solo second (and the winner's share of the purse). Jones got off to a slow start, with bogeys at three of his first five holes, then birdied the 7th and ran off a streak of nine consecutive fours. Needing a par on the par-5 18th to tie (and force a playoff round), Jones hit a tee shot, then followed with an approach to the green, leaving for eagle. Two-putting for birdie, Jones carded a one-over 73 to best Turnesa by a stroke. Bill Mehlhorn opened with 68 on Thursday, and led after both of the first two rounds, but was ten over par on Saturday and was four strokes back, in a four-way tie for third.\nJones became the first player to win the U.S. Open and British Open in the same year, and he won both again four years later in 1930, during his grand slam year. Later double Open winners were Gene Sarazen (1932), Ben Hogan (1953), Lee Trevino (1971), Tom Watson (1982), and Tiger Woods (2000). While Turnesa never won a major, he did finish second twice and his brother Jim won the PGA Championship in 1952. Another brother, Willie, won the U.S. Amateur twice and the British Amateur once. In total, eight Turnesa brothers played on the PGA Tour.\nThis was also the first year since 1919 that the tournament was extended to three days, because of the number of entries and the size of the gallery. The first two rounds were now played over two days, Thursday and Friday, with a 36-hole cut. The final two rounds continued to be played on one day, Saturday. This format continued through 1964, except for the following year in 1927, when it was held Tuesday through Thursday (with a Friday playoff). The final round in 1959 was on Sunday due to weather delays.\nScioto was only ten years old at the time, and its club pro was George Sargent, the 1909 champion, who did not compete. It later hosted the Ryder Cup in 1931 and the PGA Championship in 1950. Scioto is also noteworthy as the club where Jack Nicklaus learned to play as a youth in the 1950s, under the tutelage of Jack Grout.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, July 8, 1926\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, July 9, 1926\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, July 10, 1926 (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, July 10, 1926 (afternoon)\"\nAmateurs: Jones (+5), Evans (+14), Johnston (+21), MacDonald (+22), Shute (+28), Westland (+28).\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

Tommy Armour defeated Harry Cooper in an 18-hole playoff to win the first of his three major titles.\nThe surprise second round leader was amateur Jimmy Johnston, who won the U.S. Amateur two years later in 1929. In the third round on Thursday morning, he suffered two double bogeys on the front-nine, carded an 87 (+15), and finished in 19th place. Gene Sarazen, Walter Hagen, Bill Mehlhorn, and Emmet French were all in contention in the final round, but only French managed to break 40 on the back nine. Tommy Armour shot a final round 76 and 301 total, while Harry Cooper shot 77. Armour needed a putt for birdie on the par-4 18th to tie Cooper and force a playoff. Neither player managed to break par during any round in the tournament.\nBoth players were tied after nine holes of the Friday playoff, even though they only halved one hole. Cooper then took a two-shot lead, but an Armour birdie at 13 and a Cooper bogey at 15 brought the match to all square. On the 16th, Cooper found a bunker off the tee and recorded a double bogey, while Armour made par to gain a two-stroke advantage did not relinquish. Armour finished with a 76 to Cooper's 79.\nArmour's winning score of 301 was the highest since 1919, and the last time the winning score exceeded 300 strokes. Only one round under 70 was recorded, Al Espinosa's 69 in the final round. After Armour, no foreign-born player won the U.S. Open for another 38 years, until Gary Player in 1965. England's Ted Ray, the 1920 champion, played in his first Open since his win; it would also be his last. The 12th hole at Oakmont measured , the longest in U.S. Open history until 1955.\nWhile Armour won two more majors, Cooper never won one. His 31 PGA Tour victories are the most by a player without a major win, and he is often cited as the \"best player to never win a major.\"\nDefending champion Bobby Jones and Eddie Jones shared low-amateur honors and tied for eleventh. It was the only time in his eleven U.S. Open appearances that Bobby Jones finished outside the top ten.\nThis was the first U.S. Open held at Oakmont, which hosted its ninth in 2016.

Johnny Farrell defeated noted amateur Bobby Jones in a 36-hole playoff to win his only major title. For Jones, a two-time champion in 1923 and 1926, it was his second playoff loss at the U.S. Open in four years and his fourth finish as a runner-up. He won the next two in 1929 and 1930.\nJones jumped out to the 36-hole lead with rounds of 73-71, two shots ahead of George Von Elm and Bill Leach. After a 73 in the third round, Jones took a two-stroke lead over Leach and Henry Ciuci into the final round. Five strokes behind Jones was Farrell, who had recorded rounds of 77-74-71. Farrell teed off well before Jones and shot 72 and a 294 total. With Jones still on the course with the lead, Farrell did not believe he had a chance of winning. In his final round, Jones was uncharacteristically erratic on holes six through ten, at seven-over-par for those five holes. He regrouped on the last eight holes and carded a 77 (+6) for 294 (+10). Gene Sarazen informed Farrell in the clubhouse that he and Jones were tied. Roland Hancock, age 21, would have won the championship by two strokes had he parred the final two holes, but he double-bogeyed 17 and bogeyed 18 to fall a shot out of the playoff.\nThis was the first year that the USGA implemented a 36-hole playoff. On the first 18, Farrell shot a 70 to Jones' 73. Beginning the second 18, however, Jones quickly got back to all square after two holes. Jones double-bogeyed the 4th to give Farrell a two-stroke lead once again, but three consecutive bogeys beginning at the 10th knocked Farrell out of the lead. Now trailing by one with six holes to play, Farrell nearly aced the par-3 13th, recording a birdie to tie up the match. At the 16th, Jones missed a short putt to give Farrell the lead. At 17, Farrell hit a superb approach to , while Jones was away. Jones made his birdie putt to put pressure on Farrell, who responded by holing out. At the par-5 18th, both Jones and Farrell recorded birdies, clinching a one-stroke victory for Farrell in the rain.\nThe next playoff at the U.S. Open was the following year, won by Jones by 23 strokes. The playoff in 1931 was tied after 36 holes, resulting in a second 36-hole playoff, which caused the USGA to return to the 18-hole format. The next playoff in 1939 was reduced back to 18 holes, but the top two competitors were tied and it went another 18 holes. Sudden-death following the round was not introduced until the 1950s, and not needed until 1990; it was used again in 1994 and 2008.\nThe four 18-hole courses at Olympia Fields were reduced to two in the late 1940s when the club sold half of its property.

Bobby Jones won his third U.S. Open title in a 36-hole playoff, besting Al Espinosa by 23 strokes on the West Course.\nJones opened with a 69 in the first round to grab the lead, then followed with a 75.\nAfter a third round 71, he had a three-stroke lead over Gene Sarazen and was four clear of Espinosa after 54 holes. Sarazen fell out of contention in the final round with a 78 and fell to a tie for third place. Espinosa shot a 75 and a 294 total, but it appeared like it would not be enough to overtake Jones. Beginning with the 15th, Jones needed only three bogeys and a par to win the championship. However, he triple-bogeyed the 15th and then made another bogey on 16 and his lead was gone. He made par at the 17th, but his approach on the 18th found a greenside bunker. Needing to get up-and-down to save par and force a playoff, Jones rolled in a putt for the tie.\nJones dominated the 36-hole playoff on Sunday, with a 72 in the morning round to grab a 12-shot lead. Espinosa struggled again on the second 18, shooting an 80 to Jones' 69, and Jones won the playoff by 23 shots. He won his fourth U.S. Open in 1930 and the grand slam.

Bobby Jones won his second consecutive and record-tying fourth U.S. Open title. Having already won the British Amateur and the British Open in June, Jones secured his third consecutive major title of the single-season at the U.S. Open. He completed the grand slam with a victory in late September at Merion in the fourth and final leg, the U.S. Amateur.\nThe 1930 U.S. Open was played in oppressive heat, and the first round on Thursday saw Macdonald Smith and 1927 champion Tommy Armour share the lead, with Jones a stroke behind. Jones was one-under through eight holes in his second round when he hit one of his most famous shots: the \"lily pad shot.\" Jones was attempting to reach the par-5 9th in two shots when two spectators ran onto the fairway during his swing. He mishit the ball toward the lake where it fell about twenty yards short of dry ground. Incredibly, the ball skipped off a lily pad and onto the far bank, just thirty yards short of the green. Jones would get up-and-down for an unlikely birdie, one that only added to his growing legend. Jones finished the round with a 73, putting him at 144 in a tie for second, two strokes behind leader Horton Smith.\nJones took command over the final two rounds on Saturday; he shot 68 in the third round in the morning and started the final round with a front-nine 38. However, he ran into trouble with a bogey at 12 and a double bogey at 13. Now leading Smith by only one shot, Jones birdied 14 and 16. After finding the water on 17 and settling for a bogey, he needed to two-putt from on the 18th for the championship. Instead, he holed out for birdie and a two-stroke victory over Smith, who claimed the $1,000 winner's share of the $5,000 purse as the top professional. In third place was 36-hole leader Horton Smith, who won the first edition of Jones' \"Augusta National Invitation Tournament\" in 1934, later known as the Masters Tournament, and again in 1936.\nJones became the first to successfully defend his Open title since John McDermott in 1911–12. He was now tied with Willie Anderson with four Open titles, but he would not attempt to win a fifth. Only four have won consecutive U.S. Opens since: Ralph Guldahl (1937, 1938), Ben Hogan (1950, 1951), Curtis Strange (1988, 1989), and Brooks Koepka (2017, 2018).

Billy Burke won his only major title, defeating George Von Elm in a marathon 72-hole playoff, the longest in tournament history.\nVon Elm, the 1926 U.S. Amateur champion, held the 54-hole lead at 217 after rounds of 75-69-73. Burke, playing just ahead of Von Elm in the final round, carded a 73 and a 292 total. Von Elm bogeyed 12, 14, 15, and 16, and needed a birdie at 18 to force a 36-hole playoff on Sunday.\nIn the playoff, Von Elm and Burke were still tied after 36 holes, with Von Elm making a birdie on the 36th to extend it. In the era prior to sudden-death, 36-hole playoffs were required to break ties, so another was held the following day.\nIn the morning round, Von Elm shot a 76 and led by a stroke, but Burke took the lead late in the afternoon round at the 32nd and extended it to two strokes at the 34th. A bogey on the final hole narrowed Burke's victory margin to one stroke, 148 to Von Elm's 149. Burke reportedly smoked 32 cigars during the tournament, and quipped afterwards: \"George Von Elm lost . I gained three.\"\nFollowing this tournament, the USGA reduced the length of all future playoffs to 18 holes, which remained the format until 2018. A second playoff round was played in 1939 and 1946. Sudden-death after 18 holes was added in the 1950s, but was not needed until 1990, and was used again 1994 and 2008.\nLeo Diegel made a hole-in-one during the second round, only the third in U.S. Open history and first since 1922. He missed the playoff by two strokes and finished in third place. Low-amateur went to Philip Perkins, who finished in a tie for seventh. Three-time British Open champion Henry Cotton played the first of two U.S. Open appearances this year, missing the cut.

Gene Sarazen won his second U.S. Open championship, and the fifth of his seven major titles, ten years after his first U.S. Open win. Earlier in the month, he won the 1932 British Open in England.\nSarazen began with rounds of 74 and 76, which left him five strokes behind co-leaders José Jurado and Philip Perkins. With a three-under-par back-nine in the third round, Sarazen carded an even-par 70 to get within a shot of Perkins after 54 holes. Perkins continued his solid play in the final round, shooting a 70 and a 289 total, while Bobby Cruickshank shot 68 to tie him. They were no match for Sarazen on this day, however, who carded a 66 (−4) to earn a three-stroke victory at 286.\nSarazen set several scoring records on his way to the Open title. His 66 in the final round set a new tournament record, and a champion did not shoot a better final round until Arnold Palmer closed with 65 in 1960. His 286 total tied the tournament record, while his 136 over the final 36 holes set a record that stood until 1983. Sarazen was certainly helped by his familiarity with the venue; he was club pro at Fresh Meadow for five years, from 1925 to 1930.\nFour-time major champion Jim Barnes played his final major and finished in 55th place. Johnny Goodman won low-amateur honors at 14th; he went on to win the championship the following year, and remains the last amateur champion.\nThe course where this U.S. Open was played in Queens no longer exists. Designed by A. W. Tillinghast, it opened in 1923 and also hosted the PGA Championship in 1930, won by Tommy Armour. Under increasing development and tax pressure, the Fresh Meadow Country Club sold the property in 1946, which was developed as a residential neighborhood (the Fresh Meadows section of Queens). The club then purchased the property, clubhouse, and golf course of the defunct Lakeville Golf &amp; Country Club in Lake Success, its current home.\nDaily admission for the U.S. Open in 1932 was $2.20, or $5.50 for all three days.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 23, 1932\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 24, 1932\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 25, 1932 (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, June 25, 1932 (afternoon)\""

Amateur Johnny Goodman outlasted Ralph Guldahl by a single stroke to win his only major championship.\nGoodman's victory was the eighth and most recent by an amateur at the U.S. Open; Bobby Jones won four, the last in 1930 was part of his grand slam.\nGoodman, an Omaha insurance salesman, opened with a 75 (+3), which put him seven strokes off the lead held by 1927 champion Tommy Armour. His second round was one for the record books, as he tied Gene Sarazen's tournament record with a 66 (−6). Following a third round 70 in which he needed just 28 putts, Goodman had a six-stroke lead over Guldahl.\nAfter opening the final round with a par, eagle, and birdie, Goodman's play suddenly declined as he shot six over par for the next six holes; the lead was reduced to two strokes at the turn. Goodman bounced back and recorded four consecutive pars, then bogeyed 14, birdied 15, and bogeyed 17. A par at the last gave him a 76 and a 287 total. At the final hole, Guldahl found a greenside bunker and missed the putt to save par that would have forced a Sunday playoff. Brothers Mortie and Olin Dutra of California placed in the top ten at sixth and seventh, respectively. Olin won the title the next year at Merion, near Philadelphia.\nA number of amateurs came close to winning majors in the generation after Goodman's victory. Frank Stranahan tied for second at the 1947 Open Championship and 1953 Open Championship. Ken Venturi, age 24, led the Masters in 1956 for the first three rounds but finished runner-up by a stroke. At the 1960 U.S. Open 20-year-old Jack Nicklaus of Ohio State led midway through the final round and finished runner-up, two strokes back. The final runner-up finish for an amateur was at the 1961 Masters Tournament when Charles Coe tied for second with Arnold Palmer. However Goodman was the last amateur to ever win a major championship. The most recent top ten finish at the U.S. Open by an amateur was in 1971 when 54-hole leader Jim Simons of Wake Forest placed fifth.\nGoodman's only other top ten finish at the U.S. Open was in 1937, in eighth place as low amateur; he won the U.S. Amateur championship later that year.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 8, 1933\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 9, 1933\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 10, 1933 (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, June 10, 1933 (afternoon)\"\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;"

Dutra overcame an eight-stroke deficit after 36 holes to win his second major title; he won the PGA Championship in 1932.\nBobby Cruickshank opened the tournament with a pair of 71s, and had a three-stroke lead over Sarazen at the midway point. Sarazen carded a 73 in the third round to take a one-shot lead over Cruickshank. In the final round on Saturday afternoon, both Cruickshank and Sarazen were overcome by Dutra, who took the lead after birdies at 10 and 15. Sarazen took a triple bogey on the 11th while Cruickshank bogeyed 5 of the final 7 holes. Despite a pair of bogeys to finish the round, Dutra's 72 (+2) and total of 293 (+13) was enough to secure the victory.\nDutra's win was all the more impressive after he fell ill before the tournament and was laid up for three days in his hotel room.

        "text": "The 1935 U.S. Open was the 39th U.S. Open, held June 6–8 at Oakmont Country Club in Oakmont, Pennsylvania, a suburb northeast of Pittsburgh. Sam Parks Jr., a 25-year-old club pro at nearby South Hills Country Club with no prior tournament wins, prevailed by two strokes in difficult scoring conditions for his only major title. The purse was $5,000 and the winner's share was $1,000.\nJimmy Thomson owned the 36-hole lead after consecutive rounds of 73, despite severe weather that caused scores to soar. Sam Parks trailed by four, but in the third round he recorded a chip-in for eagle to tie Thomson, who shot a 77. The weather only got worse during the final round, and Thomson could do no better than a 78. Parks, however, shot a 76 for a two-stroke victory. Walter Hagen briefly led during the final round, but four consecutive bogeys knocked him back to third. It would be the last time that Hagen would contend in a major championship. Scoring conditions were so difficult that no player in contention broke 75 and 73 was the lowest score of the round.\nParks was certainly helped by his preparation for the tournament. Every day for a month, he stopped at Oakmont to play a practice round before returning to his own club. This practice paid off particularly on Oakmont's notoriously difficult greens, where he three-putted just twice in 72 holes. His winning score of 299 was the highest since 1927, also at Oakmont, and he was the only player to break 300. Born in nearby Bellevue, Parks was an alumnus of the University of Pittsburgh, where he had been captain of the golf team.\nThe field of 159 included six entrants from Japan and one from South Africa; the rest from 31 states and the District of Columbia. For the first time, a Japanese player made the cut at the Open. Kanekichi Nakamura was part of a tour of the U.S. by Japanese golfers and finished in 58th at 325. Chris Brinke captured low-amateur honors in 32nd place at 315, a stroke ahead of 1933 champion Johnny Goodman.\nOakmont had previously hosted the U.S. Open in 1927, the PGA Championship in 1922, and the U.S. Amateur in 1919 and 1925.\nThe Stimpmeter was inspired by the fast greens of this Open.

The purse was $5,000 and the winner's share was $1,000. The Upper Course was used for this championship; the Lower Course has been used for all subsequent majors at Baltusrol.\nEntering the final round, Cooper led Manero by four strokes. Manero's final round 67 (−5) was a course record and gave him a 72-hole total of 282 (−6), two strokes ahead of Cooper, who shot 73 (+1) for 284. Manero's total of 282 set a new U.S. Open tournament record by four shots; the previous record of 286 was set in 1916.\nManero was fortunate to even be in the championship, because during sectional qualifying, he needed a chip-in on his final hole just to qualify. His victory was not without controversy. During the final round he was paired with Gene Sarazen, whose tournament scoring record he would break. Sarazen apparently requested the pairing as he believed he could help the notoriously high-strung Manero, a close friend, stay calm. Afterwards a complaint was filed with the USGA alleging that Sarazen was actually giving advice to Manero, a violation of the rules. After a meeting, the USGA ruled that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing, and Manero was allowed to keep the championship.\nIn contrast to the previous year, scoring conditions at the Open were ideal throughout the week. For the tournament, 38 players broke par and the scoring average was 76.04, both numbers setting U.S. Open records. Chuck Kocsis finished as low amateur in a tie for 14th place.\nA record field of 1,278 entered the qualifying for this U.S. Open, up from 1,177 in 1935.\nCourse.\nUpper Course\nLengths of the courses for previous major championships at Baltusrol:\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 4, 1936\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 5, 1936\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 6, 1936 (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, June 6, 1936 (afternoon)\""

Ralph Guldahl won the first of his two consecutive U.S. Opens, two strokes ahead of runner-up Sam Snead, making his U.S. Open debut.\nSnead opened with a 69 to share the lead with Denny Shute. Through 54 holes, Snead and Guldahl trailed Ed Dudley by a stroke. During the final round on Saturday afternoon, Dudley shot a 76 and fell out of contention, while Snead birdied the last to finish with a 71 and a 283 total. Guldahl, playing well behind Snead, holed a putt for eagle at 8, then a birdie from at 9. After bogeys at 10 and 11, he rallied with birdies on the next two holes. He then went even on his last five holes to finish with a 69 and a 281 total, two better than Snead and a stroke better than the previous tournament record, set the previous year by Tony Manero.\nTwo years earlier, Guldahl had become so frustrated with the game that he quit to become a carpenter. After deciding to return to the game, he went through a period of dominance throughout the late-1930s. He won the Western Open, then considered on-par with the major championships, three years in a row; was runner-up in the Masters Tournament in 1937 and 1938 before winning in 1939; and successfully defended this U.S. Open title in 1938. For Snead, age 25, this tournament was just the beginning of a hard-luck career in the U.S. Open; he finished runner-up four times at the only major he never won.\nGuldahl won the title with 19 clubs in his bag.

It was the second of Guldahl's three major titles.\nMetz owned a four-stroke lead over Guldahl after Saturday morning's third round, but Metz struggled in the afternoon and shot a 79 (+8) to finish at 290 (+6). Guldahl began his round with two birdies in his first six holes on his way to a 69 (−2) and an even-par 284 total, six strokes ahead of Metz.

        "text": "The Englewood Golf Club, also sometimes known as the Englewood Golf and Country Club, was a private golf course in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States, located in Englewood and Leonia, just west of New York City. Opened as a nine-hole course in 1896, a second nine was added four years later; it hosted the U.S. Amateur in 1906 and the U.S. Open in 1909. \nDuring the 1950s, the club became a popular spot for entertainers and athletes, and for a while was co-owned by several comedians. The course was split in half by construction of a portion of Interstate 95 in 1963, but play continued. Financial and other problems ensued, however, and the club closed in 1977. Houses and condominiums were built over the course during the 1980s. \nThroughout its existence, the golf course was used by children for sledding in the winter.\nBeginnings.\nAs an organization, the Englewood Golf Club was formed in early 1896 and a nine-hole course was laid out by Harry Stark, a Scotsman who also managed the course. The course was built along a series of smaller hills, running down the overall cuesta slope descending from The Palisades. The Englewood Golf Club officially opened on June 6, 1896, with a long drive competition followed by nine holes of golf. It was one of the first golf courses in the United States. (Newspaper stories sometimes stated that it was the second oldest in the country, but such claims have been common in various parts of the nation, and a number of clubs and courses are known to have been created earlier.)\nThe following year saw the leasing of of land and the building of a clubhouse. The club had 112 members in its first year, almost evenly divided between men and women, and over 250 members by 1900. The young Dwight Morrow is said to have been an original member there. The club was one of the first to allow golfing on Sundays.\nChampionships.\nThe successful staging of the U.S. Amateur in 1906, then the most prestigous tournament in the nation, resulting in the U.S. Open coming to the venue. The playing of the 1909 U.S. Open featured several scoring records, including two golfers breaking 70 in an Open for the first time. The 1911 Metropolitan Open was another nationally visible tournament that the course hosted, which again featured scoring records and a growing belief that the course was not difficult enough for championship play.\nThe noted golf course architect Donald Ross made alterations in 1916 to make the course tougher by adding bunkering and changing the contours of the greens. However, the inability to lengthen the course due to the constraints of the property, together with the opening of many excellent courses during the 1920s, meant Englewood Golf Club would not be used for further top-level championships.\nThe course at this point was what one golf writer has termed \"a short but highly engaging test\". The front nine was unusual in having seven par-4 holes, including the first five holes; the back nine by comparison had three par-3 holes, each of which presented different challenges. Most of the holes of the layout ran parallel to Broad Avenue rather than being up-or-down with the slope; a brook ran through parts of the property, mostly at or near the bottom of the slope, and came into play on nearly half the holes.\nIn 1926, the club hosted the wedding reception of \"New York Post\" editor Joseph Cookman and his bride Mary Bass, editor of the \"Ladies Home Journal\". As a venue, the course gave good views of the valley of the Hackensack River and of the Ramapo Mountains.\nCelebrities.\nThe club went bankrupt following World War II. After a failed attempt by the members to run it themselves, the club's property was bought by the Reis family and leased to various operators. The first such lessee was Jerry Volpe, who became the head professional at the club, a position he would hold for nearly two decades. Under Volpe, it became a public golf course, a characteristic it held for seven years until reverting back to private in 1953. \nIn 1956, a 49 percent share of the lease was bought by four popular comedians who lived in Bergen County and played golf at the course: Phil Foster, Dick Shawn, Joey Bishop, and Buddy Hackett, with Volpe retaining the majority share of the lease. Other entertainment figures frequented the club, including comedian Corbett Monica. Star athletes from the New York sports world came to the club too, including Willie Mays, Whitey Ford, Billy Martin, and Rocky Graziano.\nFor decades, the course with its hills was used by children in winter for sledding. In Leonia, while there were some streets that would be closed for sledding, the golf course was still the favorite location. Sleigh riding, bobsledding, and skiing also took place on the course.\nInterstate.\nIn 1963, the course was severely affected by construction of what was then known as the Bergen-Passaic Expressway, a piece of Interstate 95 in New Jersey that made a direct connection to the George Washington Bridge. The owners of the club's land lost from their original and were awarded $360,000 (equal to $ million in ) in compensation for the portion of their property that was condemned. This new portion of the New Jersey Turnpike was built on the border between Englewood and Leonia (after officials of each town had battled against proposals that would have had the path going solely through their town) and in doing so bisected the golf course, with in Leonia and in Englewood. The clubhouse, which was in the northeast corner of the property, was in Englewood. \nThe arrival of the interstate caused the departure of Volpe. The layout was redone by the new club professional, Alec Ternyei, in order to still provide 18 holes of golf. Four holes were reassembled in a different flow; in the new routing, golfers were forced to walk on Broad Avenue, underneath the expressway, to get from the sixth green to the seventh tee.\nIn 1964, the lessee became a holding company partly run by Anthony Scotto, an officer of Local 1814 of the International Longshoremen's Association, although Scotto stated that it was his wife who represented that company. It was an issue because under the Labor-Management Improper Practices Act, ownership of the golf club would be in a conflict-of-interest situation with respect to his position in the union. This question of ownership became part of a lengthy investigation into Scotto's activities by the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor. Scotto was a controversial figure, seen by some as a progressive leader of organized labor and a philanthropist but by others as an opportunistic hoodlum involved in racketeering. The Englewood Golf Club already had several people known to be frequenting it who were reputed to be in the rackets, including Angelo DeCarlo and Thomas Eboli, as well as Anthony Provenzano and the gambler Frank Erickson. Scotto was informed that the club's liquor license would not be renewed unless such people were no longer seen at the club, and in 1965 Scotto instructed these persons to play elsewhere. Scotto's company sold the club in 1973.\nEnd.\nGolfing continued on the divided course, but the financial burden became too great. During the mid-1970s, the club was run by a different lessee each year, some of which failed to pay rent or were charged with violations of health regulations. During this time the property had a short-lived name change to the Rolling Hills Country Club, before reverting to the Englewood Golf and Country Club name variant.\nThen as 1977 progressed, the club's liquor license was suspended by the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control and the lessees were also behind on the rent. At this point the property owner had had enough, and the club was closed and padlocked on October 17, 1977. In January 1978, the clubhouse burned down in a fire of suspicious origin.\nSledding on the course in winter continued for a few years even after the club was closed.\nBoth Leonia and Englewood were interested in buying the golf course property and preserving it for recreational use, and started a process towards getting a Green Acres designation and funding for that purpose, but in Leonia a referendum to support this idea failed and in Englewood the local officials changed their minds in favor of the income that development would generate. Construction of 128 single-family homes on lots had begun on the Leonia side by 1982. And construction of a 339-unit group of townhouses on the Englewood side was underway by 1986, in a condominiums complex that would be called Cross Creek Point. \nOther than a street called Golf Course Drive on the Leonia side, there is little physical indication that the Englewood Golf Club ever existed."

Moldova went on to place fifth overall in the competition which featured eight teams. In 2006, Moldova entered the tournament for the second time, making it to the semi-finals before losing to Azerbaijan. After the loss, the team was relegated to the bronze medal match where they would fall once again, this time to Andorra.\nTwo years later, at the 2008 tournament, Moldova made it back to the semi-finals after going undefeated (3–0) in the group stage for the second consecutive tournament. This time, Moldova would prove too much for Andorra in an 85–74 victory to reach the final. There, the team would lose in a tightly contested match to Azerbaijan 78–80 to come away with the silver medal.

        "text": "The Irish Universities Rugby Union (IURU) is the representative body for University Rugby Union in Ireland. The Union was established in 1904 and currently consists of the following members; University College Dublin RFC, Dublin University FC, Queen's University RFC, University College Cork RFC, NUI Galway R.F.C., Maynoooth University R.F.C., University of Ulster Coleraine RFC, Dublin City University. In addition University of Limerick annually competes in IURU competitions.\nThe IURU organises and manages the Ireland Students Representative Rugby Team which competes annually. While the Irish Universities &amp; Students sides had played games against other Irish and English representative sides since the 1930s the first game against International opposition was played against the Scottish Universities side in 1954. In the past the predecessor of the Ireland Student side the Irish Combined Universities played against all the major southern hemisphere full international touring sides, e.g. playing and beating the Springboks in 1965 in Thomond Park therefore making them the first Irish side to beat an international touring team. The Combined Universities have also played against Australia in 1968 and New Zealand in 1974. The Combined Universities have toured overseas on 4 occasions, to New Zealand in 1978, to Japan &amp; South Korea in 1987, to South Africa in 1994 and to Australia in 1997.\nUniquely the Combined Universities team players wear their respective universities clubs socks with the green international jersey.\nSince the advent of professional rugby, matches against full senior international sides have become a thing of the past, however the Irish Universities Rugby Union has continued to arrange annual international fixtures against other National University and Student sides from England, Scotland, France and Wales and against IRFU developmental sides. The most recent Ireland Student fixture against the English Students was held in April 2017, at the Oxford University playing grounds on Iffley Road. The Irish team ably led by captain Darren Hudson fought out a thrilling 9 try, 36 all draw with the English Students.\n2018 saw the Irish Students side see victory against the Scottish Students. The captain, former Munster player Cian Bohane, led the team in Edinburgh to a hard-fought 33–17 win.\nThe IURU also organizes four domestic tournaments across the full spectrum of performance and participation grades. The following four competitions are held on an annual basis;\nThe Dudley Cup is the senior grade inter university competition and is named after Lord Dudley, former Viceroy of Ireland who donated the trophy following a visit by King Edward VII to what became UCC in August 1903. The first Dudley Cup final was held in March 1904 with Queen's University Belfast the inaugural winners. The Dudley Cup has been competed for on 62 occasions since and to date University College Cork and University College Dublin lead the roll of honour with 22 titles each. The Dudley Cup is played for now among the five senior grade University clubs playing in the UBAIL, namely University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin (playing as the Dublin University Football Club), Queen's University Belfast, MU Barnhall RFC and University College Cork The current holders are University College Dublin, who won the cup by defeating University College Cork on 30 November 2019 by 10–24 at the Mardyke in Cork.\nThe Conroy Cup is the U-20s grade inter-varsity rugby tournament. It was inaugurated in 1988 and it is named in honour of father and son \" Judge\" Conroy &amp; Paddy Conroy both past Presidents of UCD RFC. Unlike the Dudley Cup, both NUI Galway and Maynooth University take part in this competition. Uniquely this is the only under 20 club rugby competition with participants from all four provinces. The current holders are Trinity College Dublin FC who led by team captain James Hickey retained the trophy by defeating Maynooth in the 2017–2018 final.\nThe Maughan-Scally Cup is the junior grade inter-varsity rugby tournament. It was inaugurated in 2010 and is named after two stalwarts of UCD RFC and university rugby in Ireland. The Maughan-Scally is considered to be the most social, enjoyable and \"old school\" of the inter-varsity competitions. The current holders are University of Ulster Coleraine who led by team captain Dave Gilkinson retained the trophy by beating Queen's University in the 2017–2018 final.\nThe Kay Bowen Trophy is the ladies inter-varsity rugby tournament. It was inaugurated in 2012 and is named after Kay Bowen past President of Dublin University Rugby Club. The competition is played over one day and is hosted in turn by one of the member clubs. This competition is the largest organized by the IURU with over 220 players competing annually. The current holders are Dublin City University who led by team captain Eimear Corri defeated previous holders NUI Galway in the 2017–2018 final.\nReferences.\nIURU page on IRFU website (www.irishrugby.ie)"

The premise of the game is based on motocross racing across twelve different tracks, while being able to attack opponents during the race. \"Motocross Championship\" received mixed reviews, with criticism on multiple aspects of the game. Some reviewers have suggested the game's quality impacts the 32X negatively.\nGameplay.\nThe game is based on the sport of motocross. Players race from a perspective behind the biker they control. The biker can punch and kick opponents while passing them. Each race is against 11 other opponents. There are 12 courses in the game, each of which is littered with obstacles. Like motocross, the courses are hilly and riders bounce and slide. Various stunts can also be performed, such as wheelies, leaning over the handlebars, speed slides, and acrobatics. Players are given the option of one of three bikes to drive. \"Motocross Championship\" includes a head-to-head multiplayer mode, as well as a single-player Season Mode that comprises 36 races. A password system is used to save progress in Season Mode.\nReception.\n\"Motocross Championship\" received mixed reviews, with some commenting on how the release hurt impressions of the 32X as a whole. \"Next Generation\" reviewed the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"comparing it to other 32bit games like the 3DO version of \"Road Rash\" is like comparing a Schwinn to a Harley Davidson. And \"Motocross Championship\" is most definitely the Schwinn.\" \"GamePro\"'s Captain Squideo criticized the game's graphics but praised the sound, and called the game \"fast fun\". Two separate reviewers for \"GameFan\" scored the game 79 and 88 out of 100, with each praising the controls. \"Mean Machines Sega\" had two reviewers score the game 63 out of 100, with reviewer Gus calling the game's graphics \"a hasty piece of work worth avoiding\" and reviewer Paul noted the blurry racers and similar-looking tracks. \"Sega Magazine\" scored the game 64 out of 100 and also compared the game to \"Road Rash\", with the reviewer calling the game \"an embarrassment to the 32X\", as well as \"slow and unimaginative\". A reviewer for \"Computer and Video Games\" gave the game 59 out of 100, stating that \"the 32X takes another great leap backwards with this release\" due to poor coloring, sound, and a lack of playability and game depth."

        "text": "The Oregon Ducks baseball team represents the University of Oregon in NCAA Division I college baseball in the Pac-12 Conference. The home games are played on campus at PK Park.\nHistory.\nOregon played its first baseball game in 1877 and established the program in 1885.\nThe UO team made one College World Series appearance, in 1954, and was eliminated from the tournament after losing to Arizona and Massachusetts. A decade later in 1964, in the re-organized Athletic Association of Western Universities, Oregon was once again North Division champions, but lost at defending national champion USC in the district finals (today's super-regionals).\nAfter the 1981 season, baseball and three other varsity sports were dropped by the university (men's gymnastics, women's golf, and women's soccer) due to a budget crisis, and baseball became a club sport in March 1983.\nIn July 2007, the university announced that it would again field a varsity baseball team, beginning with the 2009 season. One reason was the success of the rival Oregon State Beavers, who had repeated as College World Series champions a month earlier.\nIn the Ducks' first game in PK Park, they defeated the defending national champions, the Fresno State Bulldogs, 1–0 on a walk-off single by senior Andrew Schmidt. A sellout crowd of 2,777 was on hand for the game. After his eleventh season in 2019, head coach George Horton and the Ducks mutually agreed to part ways on May 28. Two weeks later on June 11, it was announced that Mark Wasikowski was the successor; he was previously an assistant at Oregon from 2012 through 2016, then was the head coach at Purdue in the Big Ten Conference. In his first full season as head coach of the Ducks, they hosted a regional as the 13th seed and finished second behind LSU.\nStadium.\nThe Ducks previously played baseball at Howe Field (), south of McArthur Court, named in 1936 for Dr. Herbert Crombie Howe (1872–1940), the former chairman of the English department. Howe started teaching at UO in 1901 and was its original faculty representative to the Pacific Coast Conference in 1915, partially responsible for the league's founding. When the university dropped baseball after the 1981 season, the succeeding club team continued at Howe; the field was converted to use by the Ducks' women's softball team in 1987. Softball was formerly played at Amazon Park.\nBaseball became a club sport in 1983 and Oregon was the only Pac-10 school without a varsity baseball program through 2008. Following the reinstatement of baseball, announced in 2007, the university built PK Park, directly northeast of Autzen Stadium, formerly paved parking spaces. It opened for the Ducks in 2009 and since 2010, the park is also home for the minor league Eugene Emeralds of the short season Northwest League, whose season runs from mid-June through August.\nYearly results.\nOregon notes their first year of baseball as 1877, with 1906 as the first recorded season."

A national and state representative, he played in the 1968 Rugby League World Cup-winning team for Australia as a winger. His club career was played at for the St. George Dragons and on the wing for the South Sydney Rabbitohs.\nEarly life.\nThe son of Country representative forward Jack James, Brian's rugby league career began in primary school. While attending Newington College (1955–1960) he took up rugby union and, after leaving school, played first grade for the St George Rugby Union Club.\nRugby League – club career.\nAt the end of Brian's first year at university he transferred to the St. George rugby league club (1962-1965). While at St. George he won three reserve-grade premierships and was kept out of the top grade by Reg Gasnier, Johnny Riley and Billy Smith who started with the club in the centres.\nHe won three Second Grade Premierships (1962-1964) and also a First Grade Premiership blazer in 1965. In 1962, in a Second Grade Grand Final (St George vs Wests), he scored from the kick off after St. George kicked to the backs, the ball bounced once and then he scored under the posts. It is argued that this has been the fastest try in league as it was scored 10 seconds after the kick off.\nHe then transferred to South Sydney in 1966 for four seasons where he played in three first grade Grand finals. He played four seasons as a winger for the South Sydney club from 1966 to 1969. He played in the Premiership winning sides of 1967 and 1968. He played in the 1969 loss to Balmain and crossed for Souths but was controversially ruled to have touched the corner post in the process.\nJames then retired at the start of the 1970, at the age of 26 to pursue a career in transport and logistics.\nRugby League – representative career.\nEarning the recognition at Souths which he had been denied in the star-studded Saints lineups, James was selected for New South Wales in 1968 and made two appearances against Queensland. In 1968 he was called upon for Australia's Rugby League World Cup squad and appeared in Australia's 37-4 tournament win over France at Lang Park.\nProfessional Sprinting.\nFrom 1962 – 1969 during the off-season Brian traveled throughout Australia to attend professional sprinting gifts in locations such as Devonport, Macksville, North Sydney and Coonabarabran.\nThe First Touch Football Competition.\nOn 9 February 1968, Brian and Jack Thom (who was a well known Sydney Solicitor and Patron of South Sydney), organised the first official touch football tournament at Redfern Oval.\nAll but two Sydney First Grade teams took part in the event (Western Suburbs and Canterbury). The event was billed as the \"South Sydney Charity Night\" with proceeds going to the Spastic Centre.\nJames and Thom along with the NSWRL Referees Association recorded the rules in the event program, that being 7 players per side plus two reserves, each half duration being seven minutes, the field is 70 yards by 40 yards and a player is \"tackled\" when he is touched with two hands by an opposition player."

        "title": "Skateboarding styles",
        "text": "A skateboard style refers to the way a skateboarder prefers to ride a skateboard. Skateboard styles can be broadly divided into two different categories: skateboarding to perform tricks and skateboarding as a means of transportation. Styles of skateboarding have evolved and are influenced by a number of factors including sociocultural evolution, mass media, music, technology, corporate influence and individual skill level.\nThe styles used by different skateboarders when riding skateboards should not be confused with skater style, the manner in which skateboarders dress or act in relation to skateboarding culture.\nStyles.\nFreestyle.\nProbably the oldest style of skateboarding, freestyle skateboarding developed from the use of skateboards as a mode of transport in the 1960s. Professional freestyle competitions often involved music and choreography and focused on fluidity and technical skill. The style changed significantly with the introduction of ollies and other tricks in the 1980s and the introduction of various obstacle elements. The emphasis in freestyle is technical flat ground skateboarding. Often a freestyler will need little more than a board and a smooth, flat surface. Music and choreography have always been an essential part of the professional freestyle routine.\nVert.\nVert skateboarding has its genesis in \"pool riding\" - the riding of skateboards in emptied backyard swimming pools - during the 1970s. It involves skateboard riders moving from the horizontal (on the ground) to the vertical (on a ramp or other incline) to perform tricks - thus \"vert\". It is also referred to as \"transition skateboarding\". Skateboarders usually set-up their boards with 55mm (or larger) wheels and wider decks for more stability.\nStreet.\nStreet skateboarding involves the use of urban obstacles like stairs and their handrails, planter boxes, drainage ditches, park benches and other street furniture. Skaters perform tricks around, on, onto or over these obstacles. Skateboarders usually set-up their boards with 55mm (or smaller) wheels and narrower decks to make the board flip and spin faster and to make performing flip tricks easier. Skateboard parts can be individually repaired or replaced should they require maintenance.\nProminent professional skateboarders design and endorse professional skateboard shoes, often with their name or logo. Some of the most prolific pro skateboard shoe designers include Eric Koston, Daewon Song, Kareem Campbell, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Marc Johnson, Geoff Rowley, and Anthony Van Engelen. Each of them has several iconic \"pro model\" designs mass-produced and sold as part of endorsement contracts with various professional skate shoe manufacturers.\nPark.\nPark skateboarding encompasses a variety of sub-styles adopted by those who ride skateboards in purpose-built skate parks. Most skate parks combine halfpipes and quarterpipes with various other \"vert\" skateboarding features as well as \"street\" obstacles such as stairs, ledges, and rails. The integration of these elements produces a different skating experience.\nSlalom and one wheel.\n\"Slalom\" skateboarding is one way of showing skateboarding skills. The \"one-wheel\" skateboarding is a difficult style requiring balance and practice.\nCruising.\nCruising can be achieved with any type of skateboard through general urban areas without tricks. Skateboarders in this category often use \"cruisers\" which are generally wider and have rubbery wheels. Cruising, similarly to Downhill Skateboarding, is often used for transportation.\nDownhill.\nNon-competition downhill skateboarding is one of the oldest styles of skateboarding and was popular in the early 1970s. Original longboards were described as being like snow skis (in terms of length). Modern riders often use longboards for races, but some use regular skateboards for non-competition downhill skateboarding. There are currently two worldwide governing bodies for street luge, the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) and the International Downhill Federation (IDF)."

        "title": "Ed Doherty (baseball executive)",
        "text": "Edward Sylvester Doherty Jr. (March 30, 1900 – July 8, 1971) was an American front office executive in minor league and Major League Baseball. He served as the first general manager in the history of the second modern-era Washington Senators franchise (now the Texas Rangers), from the expansion team's formation following the 1960 season through the end of the 1962 campaign. Born in Providence, Rhode Island, he was a graduate of Providence College's Class of 1924.\nMinor league executive.\nDoherty joined Washington after spending the previous 7½ seasons as president of one of the three Triple-A minor leagues of the day, the American Association. Doherty's earlier career included working as a journalist in his native Providence, a 1940–46 stint in the front office of the Boston Red Sox as publicity director, and six seasons (1947–52) as president of Boston farm teams—the Scranton Red Sox of the Class A Eastern League and the Louisville Colonels of the American Association.\nAfter assuming the Association's presidency in 1953, he led the league through a tumultuous time during which it lost (or would lose) some of its most important cities—traditional powers Milwaukee, Kansas City, Minneapolis and St. Paul, as well as new entry Houston—to Major League franchise shifts and planned expansion. He also faced a threat from a potential third Major League, the Continental League, that would have taken many of those same markets had it been born. With the loss of Milwaukee and Kansas City, and struggles in less successful venues (Toledo and Columbus), Doherty oversaw the Association's expansion into markets such as Charleston, Denver, Omaha, Wichita, Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth, during that period.\nDoherty was one of the most vocal opponents of Major League Baseball expansion, leading the minor leagues' resistance to rumored plans at the 1959 baseball winter meetings. Ironically, Doherty would gain his Major League general manager job when the American League's original Washington franchise decamped for the American Association's Minneapolis and St. Paul territories after 1960 to become the Minnesota Twins, creating an opening for an expansion club in the U.S. capital.\nThe expansion Senators.\nDoherty was appointed by the new Senators' first majority owner, Elwood \"Pete\" Quesada, a retired United States Air Force general, and his first task was to sign a manager and draft players. He selected as his skipper Mickey Vernon, longtime Washington fan favorite from the 1940s and 1950s as a first baseman and two-time batting champion, and a member of the 1960 World Series champion Pittsburgh Pirates coaching staff. He drafted well-known veterans such as Dick Donovan, Bobby Shantz, Gene Woodling and Dale Long in the expansion lottery, then traded Shantz to Pittsburgh to acquire a package of players that included pitcher Bennie Daniels, who would lead the 1961 Senators in victories.\nPredictably, the new Senators struggled in their maiden season, losing 100 games and finishing tied for last place in the ten-team American League. Seeking improvement on the field and a drawing card at the gate as the Senators prepared to move into the new DC Stadium for 1962, Doherty traded Donovan, the 1961 AL earned run average champion, and his leading home run hitter, catcher/outfielder Gene Green, to the Cleveland Indians for charismatic veteran center fielder Jimmy Piersall, coming off one of his best seasons. But Piersall struggled in Washington, batting only .244, and the 1962 Senators lost 101 games and finished, by themselves, in the basement. Donovan, meanwhile, won 20 games for Cleveland. During the season, Doherty and Vernon were publicly criticized by owner Quesada because of the Senators' poor showing. At the close of the campaign, Quesada sold his share in the Senators, and Doherty was replaced as GM by George Selkirk, the former New York Yankees' star.\nDoherty's departure from the Senator front office did not signal the end of his career in baseball, nor with the team. He returned to the minor leagues in 1963 as general manager of the Double-A Nashville Vols, an affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels. When the Nashville club disbanded after one season, Doherty went to work in the office of Ford Frick, the Commissioner of Baseball, as Frick's liaison to NCAA baseball programs. Then, in 1969, he was engaged by the Senators as an off-field assistant to manager Ted Williams, the Red Sox' former superstar and Hall of Famer then in his first year at the Washington helm.\nTwo years later, Doherty died at age 71 in Winchester, Massachusetts. He was elected to the Providence College Athletics Hall of Fame in 1971, the year of his passing."

        "title": "Rice Owls baseball",
        "text": "The Rice Owls baseball team is the interscholastic baseball team representing Rice University in Houston, Texas, United States. The Owls have appeared often in the NCAA tournament since the tenure of head coach Wayne Graham began in 1992. The program participated in every tournament from 1995 until 2017, and won the national championship in 2003, the first national championship for Rice athletics in any team sport.\nRice is a member of the NCAA Division I American Athletic Conference. Previously, it has played in the now-defunct Southwest Conference,the Western Athletic Conference and Conference USA. From 1997–2008, Rice won 12 consecutive regular season titles in its conference or division. Nine of the championships came in the Western Athletic Conference, while the final three came in Conference USA. The streak ended in 2009 when East Carolina won the regular-season conference title; however, Rice won the post-season tournament. Rice subsequently won the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 regular-season C-USA titles.\nRice plays its home games at Reckling Park on the Rice campus in Houston. Rice is also a yearly participant in the Houston College Classic, held since 2001 at the Houston Astros' Minute Maid Park.\nHistory.\nSouthwest Conference (1914–1996).\nIn 83 years of Southwest Conference play, Rice finished in the bottom half of the conference in 72 times. Rice finished in last place for 24 of those seasons. The highest Rice rankings in SWC regular season play were second-place finishes in 1984 and 1994. \nThe Wayne Graham Era (1992–2018).\nThe modern era of Rice baseball began in 1992, when Wayne Graham, who had previously led San Jacinto College to five junior college championships, became head coach. Graham has coached 27 different players to All-America honors. In 1995, Rice finally broke through to make the first NCAA tournament appearance in school history--the first of 20 consecutive tournament appearances, including seven College World Series. \nA year later, Rice won the 1996 Southwest Conference baseball tournament, the final SWC tournament. It would be the first of 19 consecutive regular-season or tournament titles in three different conferences.\nRecently, Baseball America ranked Rice as the best baseball program in a nine-year survey of all 293 Division I programs since 1999. Data cited in the survey included Rice's five College World Series appearances and 2003 championship, its 35 major-league draft picks, and its 15 All-America selections over that span. Graham whose 953 victories over 21 seasons make him both the winningest and longest-tenured coach in Rice history.\n2003 National Championship.\nRice entered the 2003 postseason having won 30 consecutive games early in the season and having won the WAC regular-season championship. The team had a 3–0 record in the regional round, defeating McNeese State once and Wichita State twice at Reckling Park to advance to the super regionals. In the super regionals, Rice faced off against cross-town rival Houston. In the regular season, Rice had beaten the Cougars in four of five games. After losing the first game 5-2, Rice rallied to win the second game 10–2 behind four home runs, including a three-run homer by Vincent Sinisi. Rice advanced to their second consecutive College World Series by winning 5–2 in game 3.\nRice entered the 2003 College World Series with a starting rotation made up of three sophomore pitchers: Jeff Niemann, Wade Townsend, and Philip Humber. Rice won its first three games in the tournament– a 4–2 win over Southwest Missouri State (now Missouri State University), a 12–2 defeat of defending champion Texas, and a second victory over Texas to advance to the championship round. Texas had already lost to Rice 2–1 earlier in the season. The Owls defeated Texas on catcher Justin Ruchti's one-run RBI single in the bottom of the 9th off of Texas closer Huston Street. The Owls' two wins against Texas was a change of outcome from the previous CWS, where Texas had beaten Rice in their opening game.\nIn the best-of-three championship series, Rice played against Stanford. Rice won the first game with its second consecutive walk-off victory, as Chris Kolkhorst scored from second on a throwing error in the bottom of the 10th to win 4-3. Stanford rallied in the second game the next night to win 8-3, but the Owls defeated the Cardinal in the final game 14–2 to win Rice's first national championship in a team sport. Each member of the Owls pitching rotation pitched in the championship series; Niemann recovered from three early runs to pitch seven scoreless innings in game one, Townsend pitched well in game two despite two seventh inning errors, and Humber threw a complete-game five-hitter to win game three.\nIn Houston after the championship series, the Owls were honored in a parade by the City of Houston. The University commissioned a painting of the championship to sell to fans and alumni that is still available in print form. The team also visited the White House, where then-President George W. Bush recalled watching Rice games in his youth and commended the team for their accomplishments.\nStadium.\nReckling Park is the baseball stadium at Rice University in Houston, Texas, USA. It has a capacity of 5,368 and serves as the home field of the Rice Owls baseball team. The stadium was built on the site of Cameron Field, Rice's home from 1978–99, in time for the 2000 season.\nRivalries.\nHouston.\nSince their first meeting in 1948, Rice has played Houston 191 times. They have met for each of the past 37 seasons. Since 1998, the season-long series between these two teams has been known as the Silver Glove series. Through the 2021 season, Rice leads the all-time series against their cross-town rivals by a record of 108–83.\nTexas.\nRice first played Texas in 1915, the first year of the Southwest Conference. Rice went 0–4 that first year, starting a trend of lopsided season series that lasted for 40 years, including no wins against the Longhorns for 12 years. Rice finally won two consecutive season series in 1955 and '56, and again in 1972 and '73. The only other Rice season series win before Wayne Graham came to Rice was 1978.\nOne notable win came in 1977, as Texas began the season with 34 consecutive wins, which was snapped by a 4–3 loss to the Owls in extra innings. This Texas record still stands today.\nSince Graham arrived on South Main in 1994, the two teams have played more evenly, going 15–17 in that span. During Rice's resurgence, Rice and Texas have met twice in the College World Series. In 2002, Texas handed Rice a first-round loss. In 2003, however, Rice turned the tables, defeating the Longhorns twice en route to their eventual championship.\nSince their end-of-the-season meetings in 2002 and 2003, the rivalry has been acknowledged as one of the most tense rivalries in college baseball. In the run up to the 2004 Minute Maid College Classic, \"The Daily Texan\" likened the Rice-Texas rivalry to the college basketball matchup between North Carolina and Duke, one of college sport's most famed rivalries. Factors contributing to the continued rivalry between the two schools include their proximity to one another, as well as the fact that many of their players compete together in summer leagues.\nFormer players.\nRice has sent more than 20 players on to the major leagues. Most notable among these are All-Star pitcher Norm Charlton, Gold Glover José Cruz Jr., Perfect game pitcher Philip Humber of the Houston Astros, and five-time All-Star and Astros outfielder Lance Berkman.\nIn 2004, Rice became the first school ever to have three players selected in the first round of the MLB draft when Philip Humber, Jeff Niemann, and Wade Townsend were selected third, fourth, and eighth, respectively.\nList of Rice Owls in Major League Baseball.\nActive players in bold."

        "title": "Penn State Nittany Lions women's volleyball",
        "text": "The Penn State Nittany Lions women's volleyball program has had a long tradition, founded in 1976 by Tom Tait, long-time coach of the Penn State men's team, who coached the women's team from 1976 to 1979 and was named a USA Volleyball All-Time great coach in 2007.\nRuss Rose was the head coach from 1979 to 2021. He led the program to seven NCAA national championships, first in 1999, then in each year from 2007 through 2010, and in both 2013 and 2014. Rose has led the Nittany Lions to appearances in every NCAA Division I women's volleyball tournament, making Penn State the only program in the nation to appear in every NCAA volleyball tournament since its inception in 1981. Rose is the nation's all-time leader in wins, winning percentage and NCAA tournament winning percentage.\nPrior to entering the Big Ten Conference in 1991, Penn State experienced unprecedented success in the Atlantic 10 Conference, winning eight straight championships, never losing a conference match in that time.\nNotable seasons.\n1990.\nIn 1990, Penn State entered the NCAA tournament undefeated with a 42–0 record. The Nittany Lions swept Purdue and Big Ten champion Wisconsin in the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament, before losing to Nebraska in the NCAA Regional Final. Of the team's 44 wins, 40 were sweeps, a school and national record.\nPenn State finished sixth in the final 1990 Tachikara Coaches Poll, the program's highest final ranking ever at the time. In addition, Rose earned his first AVCA National Coach of the Year honor.\n1993.\nIn 1993, the Nittany Lions surged into their third year of Big Ten play and won their second consecutive conference title. At the NCAA tournament, the team strung together four victories and earned the right to play for the National Championship against Long Beach State.\n1994.\nIn 1994, Rose coached the Nittany Lions to a second straight NCAA national semifinal appearance and picked up his 500th career win early in the season. Placing second in the Big Ten with a 17–3 conference mark, the Nittany Lions posted a 31–4 ledger on the year and ended the regular-season ranked No. 5, at the time their highest regular-season finish ever. Season highlights included beating eventual national runner-up and perennial powerhouse UCLA at the Volleyball Monthly Invitational and No. 1-ranked and undefeated Nebraska in Lincoln at the NCAA Mideast Regional final to advance to their second straight national semifinal.\n1997.\nIn 1997, Rose's Nittany Lions finished as runners-up to Stanford in the NCAA national championship game after defeating Florida, 3–0, in the semifinals. Penn State, favored to win, made their third Final Four appearance in five years. Terri Zemaitis was named the NCAA championship MVP.\n1998.\nAfter posting a runner-up finish in 1997, the Lions made it back to the NCAA Championship match in 1998. The team cruised through the regular season with a 30–0 mark, with 28 of those coming in three sets. Penn State also became only the second school to close out the Big Ten schedule with a perfect 20–0 mark.\nAfter winning its fifth Big Ten title, Penn State hosted the NCAA First and Second rounds and the Central Regional. They swept past Bucknell, Clemson, Louisville and Brigham Young to earn a spot in the school's fourth national semifinal. Once they reached the NCAA Final Four in Madison, Wisconsin, the season ended much like 1997. Penn State defeated Nebraska, 3–1, to advance to the national championship match. And once again, the Lions had to rally from a 0–2 deficit to force a fifth game, only to come up short against Long Beach State for the NCAA title. Despite losing, Cacciamani was named co-MVP for the tournament.\n1999.\nRose led Penn State to the program's first NCAA national championship (their third consecutive appearance in the NCAA title match) and their second-consecutive 20–0 record in Big Ten play (and fourth straight conference title), becoming the first team in conference history to pull off the feat. In the national semifinals, they defeated Pacific, 3–2, and in the finals they defeated Stanford, 3–0, with scores of 15–2, 15–10, 15–7, marking the first time all season that Stanford had been swept. Lauren Cacciamani was named the championship MVP for the second consecutive year. Bonnie Bremner and Cacciamani were also named first team All-Americans. Bremner became Penn State's first ever four-time All-American. Cacciamani was named the AVCA National Player of the Year, Big Ten Player of the Year, Big Ten Female Athlete of the Year and the Honda Award winner for volleyball.\nIn addition, the 1999 Nittany Lions extended their NCAA record home-match winning streak to 80 straight (extended to 87 in 2000), eclipsing the previous standard of 58 set by Florida from 1990 to 1994. The Lions streak was finally put to a halt at 87 matches with a loss to Minnesota on Sept. 29, 2000. Penn State had last dropped a match at Rec Hall on Nov. 24, 1994, when they suffered a 3–2 setback to Illinois, a span of over five seasons. The 87 home-match winning streak was only outranked by the basketball trio of Kentucky, 1943–55 (129); St. Bonaventure, 1948–61 (99) and UCLA, 1970–76 (98). Russ Rose earned his 700th career victory on September 15, 2000, in a sweep of West Virginia.\n2005.\nIn 2005, the Nittany Lions claimed their third consecutive Big Ten title with an unblemished 20–0 league record, the sixth time since 1985 that the champion had been perfect, but were upset in the NCAA tournament regional semi-final on their home court. Penn State also picked up the program's first ever AVCA National Freshman of the Year honors, for outside hitter Nicole Fawcett. Fawcett was also named Big Ten Freshman of the Year, Penn State's fourth consecutive. Senior Kaleena Walters was named Penn State's first ever Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, and senior Sam Tortorello was named the unanimous Big Ten Player of the Year. Tortorello was also named a first-team All-American and a Honda Award nominee, while Fawcett and sophomore Melissa Walbridge were named second-team All-Americans. Walters and freshman Christa Harmotto were both named to the AVCA Honorable Mention All-America team.\nIn addition to dropping only three individual games during the conference season, Penn State swept all four major honors, becoming the first school to sweep the honors in the 22 years of Big Ten women's volleyball to that point. Rose also earned his seventh Big Ten Coach of the Year award. The main starting line-up for the season consisted of two seniors, a junior, a sophomore and two freshmen.\n2006.\nIn 2006, the Nittany Lions started out the season 21–0, before finishing with a 32–3 record and an appearance in the NCAA Regional Final. The 2006 squad captured Penn State's fourth consecutive outright Big Ten championship, tying the Big Ten record of four straight, set by Penn State from 1996 to 1999.\nFreshman Megan Hodge made history as the first freshman to be named Big Ten Player of the Year in the 23-year history of the award to that point. Hodge also was named Penn State's second ever and second consecutive AVCA National Freshman of the Year, thus making Penn State the first school to win the award back-to-back. Hodge became the first ever volleyball player to win Gatorade National Player of the Year honors as a high school senior and then AVCA National Freshman of the Year honors in college. The Number 1 high school recruit also earned first team All-America honors, becoming only the third true freshman in seven years to be named to the first team. Sophomore Nicole Fawcett also picked up first team All-America honors, while sophomore Christa Harmotto earned her place on the second team. Rose earned his eighth Big Ten Coach of the Year award.\n2007.\nPenn State won its second NCAA national championship in 2007, as well as the program's fifth consecutive outright Big Ten championship. The team finished with a 20–0 Big Ten record, the second time in the last three seasons the team accomplished the feat – and finished the season off with a 34–2 overall record. On October 29, Penn State got its first Number 1 ranking since winning the NCAA title in 1999 and became the first Big Ten school since 2004 to hold the top ranking.\nIn Big Ten awards, the program picked up three of four major honors, with junior Christa Harmotto taking Player of the Year, Arielle Wilson taking Freshman of the Year, and Rose taking Coach of the Year. Harmotto, sophomore Megan Hodge, and junior Nicole Fawcett picked up first-team AVCA All-America honors, while sophomore setter Alisha Glass picked up second-team All-America honors.\nIn the 2007 NCAA Tournament, the team swept Siena, Albany, Michigan, BYU and California leading into the final. Penn State, the third overall seed in the tournament, defeated Stanford, the first overall seed in the tournament, in the NCAA national championship match that took place on December 15, 2007, at ARCO Arena in Sacramento, California. After winning the first two sets, Stanford rallied to push the match to a decisive fifth set, which Penn State won, 15–8. With the win, the Nittany Lions avenged an earlier season loss to Stanford exactly three months before on September 15.\nPenn State set two NCAA tournament records and achieved other milestones during the 2007 NCAA tournament:\nRuss Rose achieved several top honors, as he was named the AVCA Division I National Coach-of-the-Year, was inducted into the AVCA Hall of Fame, and coached his team to the national championship, all within the same week. His national Coach-of-the-Year honor made him the first Division I coach to win the award three times.\n2008.\nThe 2008 team successfully defended their 2007 National College Athletic Association title, while also setting impressive NCAA records. Media coverage considered whether the 2008 Penn State women's volleyball team was perhaps the best team in NCAA history.\nThe Nittany Lions achieved what no other NCAA Division I, II, or III volleyball program could do – win every individual set of the regular season. Penn State also broke the NCAA record for consecutive matches won (52) with a sweep of Illinois, a mark that was previously held by USC. The 2008 team also broke the NCAA record for consecutive sets won, besting the previous recordholder, Florida, who had 105. The team won 111 straight sets up until the NCAA national semifinals. Penn State set a new rally era record (2001–present) for hitting percentage, finishing the season with a mark of .390, breaking the old mark of .369 set by Florida A&amp;M. That was also the second-highest percentage of all-time for any era.\nIn Big Ten awards, Penn State placed Nicole Fawcett, Christa Harmotto, Arielle Wilson, Megan Hodge and Alisha Glass on the First Team All-Big Ten, while senior libero Roberta Holehouse earned her place on the Honorable Mention. Fawcett ended her Big Ten play being named unanimous First Team all four years, Big Ten Player-of-the-Week eight times (tying for second most all-time in the conference), the Big Ten Freshman of the Year in 2005 and the Big Ten Player of the Year in 2008.\nIn addition to having the Big Ten Player of the Year, Penn State's fourth straight honor in that category, Russ Rose was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year by the coaches and media, the tenth such honor in his career.\nA school record six players were placed on the AVCA All-Mideast Region team, with Fawcett, Harmotto, Wilson, Hodge, Glass and Blair Brown being recognized, more than any other program in the nation. Fawcett, Harmotto, Hodge and Glass then earned AVCA First Team All-America honors while Brown and Wilson earned second team honors. Six All-America honors on one team was an AVCA record.\nRuss Rose repeated as the AVCA Division I National Coach of the Year, the first time a coach ever repeated the award. It was also the fourth time Rose claimed the top honors – more than any other coach in history. In addition, Fawcett was named the AVCA Division I National Player of the Year, which was Penn State's second ever, as Lauren Cacciamani earned the top award in 1999.\nIn the 2008 NCAA Tournament, Penn State earned the overall No. 1 seed. They swept Long Island, Yale, Western Michigan and California to advance to the NCAA Final Four, held at the Qwest Center in Omaha, Nebraska. In the national semifinals, they defeated Nebraska, 3–2, in front of an NCAA record 17,430 fans. Nebraska was the only team in 2008 that won a set or more against Penn State. Nebraska's loss was their first loss in the state of Nebraska in 96 matches. In the NCAA national championship match, the Nittany Lions faced Stanford for the second straight year. It was the first time in NCAA history that the same two teams played each other in the NCAA championship in consecutive years. In the rematch, Penn State swept the Cardinal, 3–0, to win their second straight NCAA championship. The match was played in front of 14,299 fans, the third-highest attendance in NCAA history. Hodge was named the Most Outstanding Player for the national championship match for the second straight year. The team joined the 2003 USC team as the only repeat champions to go undefeated, finishing the season with a 38–0 record and a 114–2 record in individual sets. They also joined 2003 USC and 2006 Nebraska as the only teams to go wire-to-wire ranked No. 1 in the coaches poll.\n2009.\nPenn State captured its seventh consecutive and 13th overall Big Ten title after completing the regular season 32–0 (20–0 in the Big Ten) and going 96–5 in sets played. Penn State was led by seniors Megan Hodge and Alisha Glass, as well as juniors Blair Brown and Arielle Wilson.\nThe Nittany Lions did not lose a set in the NCAA tournament until the national semifinals against Hawaii Rainbow Wahine but won that match, 3–1, to set up a showdown against the No. 2 Texas Longhorns. The match against Hawaii was Coach Rose's 1,000 career win, making him the fifth person to reach that mark, reaching the win by beating another member of the 1,000 Win Club, Hawaii's coach Dave Shoji, who achieved the milestone earlier that season on October 17.\nIn the championship match, Texas grabbed a 2–0 set lead. During its winning streak, Penn State had never been down 0–2. Despite Tournament MVP Destinee Hooker's NCAA finals record 34 kills against Penn State, the Lions clawed their way back and won the match, 3–2. Penn State extended its win streak to 102 games with another perfect season, winning a record third consecutive championship. The team finished 38–0 for the second straight year, going 114–8 in set play, with a two-year record of 76–0 and 228–10 in set play.\n2010.\nIn 2010 Penn State won its first seven matches, before having its record win streak snapped at 109 in a match against Stanford on September 11. They went 16–4 in Big Ten play and claimed their eighth consecutive Big Ten Conference championship (14th overall), matching the streak of eight consecutive Atlantic 10 Championships set during all eight years in that conference. Even though they dropped five matches, they won all 20 home matches (including postseason), extending their Rec Hall winning streak to 94 games, an NCAA record for consecutive home wins. This streak ended the following season on August 26, 2011, when the Nittany Lions dropped a 3–1 match to the Oregon Ducks.\nThe Nittany Lions posted a regular season record of 26–5 and earned the fourth overall seed in the NCAA tournament, keeping alive their streak of appearing in all 30 NCAA Tournaments. The team swept Niagara, Virginia Tech and Oklahoma in the first three rounds and defeated Duke, 3–1, in the Regional Final, advancing to their eighth Final Four. Penn State was the highest seed to advance to the Final Four, as the top three seeds were defeated in earlier rounds. In the national semifinals, the Nittany Lions faced the Texas Longhorns in a rematch of the 2009 NCAA National Championship. The team swept the Longhorns and advanced to their seventh championship match. In the finals the Nittany Lions faced the California Golden Bears, marking the fourth consecutive year Penn State faced Cal in the NCAA Tournament. Penn State won the match, claiming its record fourth consecutive national championship and fifth overall, with a final record of 32–5. The Nittany Lions had to that point won 24 consecutive postseason games, another NCAA record. The standout 6'1\" freshman Deja McClendon was named the MVP of the game, and Cal's Carly Lloyd was named NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Player-of-the-Year. The championship was Coach Russ Rose's fifth, the record for a single coach in NCAA history. Seniors Arielle Wilson, Blair Brown, and Alyssa D'Errico all graduated with four national championships, the only class in NCAA history to achieve that feat. Wilson and Brown trained with the United States national team in the summer, seeking roster spots for Team USA.\n2013.\nIn its thirty-third consecutive appearance in the NCAA tournament, Penn State returned to the podium by winning its sixth national championship and fifth in the previous seven years. The mark tied Stanford for most NCAA Division I national titles and continued one of the greatest dynasties in college volleyball history. The road to the championship included a 25-game win streak and tournament wins over Michigan State in the regional semi-final, perennial powerhouse Stanford in the regional final, Pac-12 champion Washington Huskies in the national semi-final, and University of Wisconsin in the finals. In both the Stanford and Wisconsin matches, the Lions faced significant deficits (trailing 9–6 in the fifth set against Stanford and 23–20 in the fourth set against Wisconsin), but were able to overcome both, largely propelled by the service game of their junior setter, Micha Hancock, who was named Most Outstanding Player of the tournament. The Lions also received significant contributions from All American seniors Deja McClendon, Ariel Scott and Katie Slay, each of whom book-ended their Penn State careers with national titles and were named to the NCAA All-Tournament Team.\nDuring the regular season, Penn State boasted a record of 28–2, only losing in five sets to University of Texas (who would later claim the number one seed in the NCAA tournament but would lose to runner-up Wisconsin in the national semi-finals) and Michigan State (Penn State's only conference loss). Twenty of Penn State's twenty-eight wins were by shutout. The record was sufficient to secure Penn State its sixteenth Big Ten championship (in twenty-three years) and Coach Russ Rose the AVCA Coach of the Year Award, his fifth time receiving the award.\n2014.\nIn 2014 Penn State claimed its record seventh NCAA national championship and sixth in the last eight years, continuing one of the greatest dynasties in college sports. Anchored by its First Team All American senior setter and AVCA National Player of the Year, Micha Hancock, First Team All American senior middle hitter Nia Grant and senior libero Dominique Gonzalez, the Nittany Lions ended the 2014 season winning twenty straight matches, seventeen of which, including the championship match against Brigham Young University (BYU), were by shutout.\nIn addition to beating BYU in the finals, Penn State's path to the championship included straight set victories over Siena, Dayton and number 12 seed UCLA, and 3–1 wins over Big Ten champion and number 4 seed Wisconsin and the tournament number 1 seed, Stanford. Junior outside hitter Megan Courtney was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, hitting a match high 23 kills on .321 hitting and 16 digs in the Stanford match and 11 kills on .269 hitting, 14 digs and 5 blocks against BYU. Courtney single-handedly out-blocked the number 1 and number 2 blockers in the NCAA (Whitney Young and Amy Boswell) in the finals.\nIn what was seen as a rebuilding year, given the departures of All Americans Deja McClendon, Katie Slay and Ariel Scott, Penn State's success and 36–3 overall record was largely attributed to the performance of its highly touted freshmen, Ali Frantti (AVCA National Freshman of the Year and AVCA Second Team All American), who led the team with 391 kills, Haleigh Washington (Big Ten Freshman of the Year), who paced the team with a .463 hitting percentage, and Simone Lee, who had 135 kills and contributed significantly in Penn State's wins over Wisconsin during the regular season and the NCAA tournament. Aiyana Whitney, the junior outside hitter and AVCA Second Team All American, was also a pivotal piece of Penn State's championship team – accumulating 372 kills on .353 hitting. With Grant, Frantti, Whitney, Washington, Courtney and Lee, Penn State had one of the most balanced attacks in the nation and led the NCAA in hitting.\nIn addition to being named the AVCA National Player of the Year in 2014, Micha Hancock ended her storied Penn State career with 3 AVCA First Team All American honors, two Big Ten Setter of the Year awards (2012, 2013), the Big Ten Freshman of the Year award (2011), and as the NCAA tournament's Most Outstanding Player (2013). She leaves Penn State atop both the school's and the Big Ten's record books in career service aces and as the NCAA's all-time leader for aces in a single-season during the rally-scoring era (126).\nProgram record and history.\nOn November 1, 2008, with a sweep of Iowa, the program reached 1,000 wins, becoming just the sixth NCAA Division I women's volleyball program to reach the milestone.\nThe program is the only Division I school to make every single NCAA tournament appearance (1981–2021).\nNCAA Records.\nSource: NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Records \nTeam.\n†The four preceding AIAW seasons were also winning years, although the combination of NCAA and AIAW seasons does not constitute an all-time record.\nHonors &amp; award history.\nBig Ten Awards.\nPenn State has received 14 Player of the Year honors, 12 Freshman of the Year honors, 4 Defensive Player of the Year honors, and 2 Setter of the Year honors. Rose has picked up a total of 15 Coach of the Year honors.\nOther awards.\nThis list includes awards to Penn State women's volleyball players and coaches by the NCAA, American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA), and other special awards.\nAll-Americans.\nPenn State has a long history of All-Americans. In all but one season under Rose, there has been at least one All-American named from his team.\nPenn State has had 34 (third all-time) different AVCA All-Americans earning 76 certificates (third all-time), including 43 First Team selections (third all-time). In 2008, Penn State landed an AVCA-record six All-Americans, four of whom were on First Team."

The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. The host country, New Zealand, is highlighted in lavender. The greatest number of medals won in each medal category, gold, silver, bronze, and total, is in boldface.\nSwimming.\nA total of 38 swimming events were contested in a 50-metre pool. To give the smaller island nations a chance against the stronger swimming nations of Australia and New Zealand the championships rules stated that in the individual events only the top two qualifiers from each country progress through to the final with the third fastest swimmer only from those countries with two swimmers qualifying for the ‘A’ final permitted to swim in the ‘B’ final. In the relay events it was one medal per country. So, for example, if New Zealand 'A' finishes first, Australia 'A' finishes second, New Zealand 'B' finishes third and New Caledonia finishes fourth, New Caledonia would be awarded the bronze medal.\nRecords broken.\nDuring the 2008 Oceania Swimming Championships, 42 Championship Records (or Meet Records) were set.

        "text": "\"Bowling\" is the twentieth episode of the second season of the American comedy television series \"Malcolm in the Middle\" and the 36th episode overall. Written by Alex Reid and directed by Todd Holland, the episode originally aired on Fox in the United States on April 1, 2001. The episode's plot serves as a parody of the 1998 film \"Sliding Doors\".\n\"Bowling\" has received positive reviews from critics since airing. Reid and Holland later received Emmy Awards for their work on the episode.\nPlot.\nMalcolm and Reese are going to a bowling party. Dewey is grounded for killing a neighbor's parakeet, and must stay home. When Lois and Hal are asked who will drive Malcolm and Reese, the screen splits, with Lois offering to take them on one side, and Hal offering on the other. From this point forward, the episode alternates between the realities in which each parent drives.\nWhen Lois takes the boys, she only has enough money for one pair of shoes and makes them share. Right away, both Malcolm and Reese notice a pretty girl named Beth (Alex McKenna) at the party. Lois soon learns that there are no adults chaperoning, then decides to stay and chaperone it herself. Reese impresses Beth, but is repeatedly interrupted before he can tell her a joke. Malcolm does terribly at bowling, and Lois' overbearing encouragement only makes the ridiculing worse. When he finally stands up to her, he only embarrasses himself. Beth finds Malcolm's courage endearing and kisses him, but Lois breaks it up and takes everyone home. Meanwhile, Dewey tricks Hal into reading him a bedtime story, which puts Hal to sleep. Free to do whatever he wants, Dewey orders pizza and watches R-rated movies.\nWhen Hal drives the boys, he buys two pairs of shoes, having stolen money from Lois' wallet, and sends them off while he takes a lane to himself. Reese's joke disgusts Beth, but Malcolm does well at bowling and Beth is impressed with him. Reese, jealous, tries to throw a bowling ball at Malcolm. He misses and hits a large man, who furiously chases him. Hal makes a strike and attempts a perfect game by repeating his actions before the strike. Malcolm leads Beth behind the pinsetter machines to make out, but his shirt catches in a pinsetter. He tumbles into Hal's lane, ruining the perfect game. Hal takes Malcolm to the car and orders Reese to come out of hiding in the photo booth. The large man notices Reese and beats him up. Meanwhile, Dewey cannot fool Lois, but when he appears to give up, she suspects he is plotting something. Eventually, Lois lets Dewey watch television, but only something he cannot enjoy: C-SPAN. Neither is sure who won.\nIn the end, both realities are again shown side-by-side, with Hal and Lois simultaneously coming home and saying to their spouse: \"Next time, \"you\" take them.\"\nCultural references.\nThe episode's plot serves as a parody of \"Sliding Doors\", in which two different timelines with the same characters are explored. \"The X-Files\" had previously done a similar episode, and Dan Harmon used this episode for inspiration of the \"Community\" episode \"Remedial Chaos Theory\".\nReception.\n\"Bowling\" has received positive reviews from critics since its airing. The episode was named among \"The A.V. Club\"'s \"best TV episodes of the decade\" for series that weren't included in their top thirty television series of the decade. \"The A.V. Club\" reviewer Emily VanDerWerff praised the episode for its \"wild stylistic innovations\" and compared, both the series and episode, to \"The Simpsons\". She went on to praise Jane Kaczmarek and Bryan Cranston's performance in the episode.\nIn 2009, TV Guide ranked this episode #90 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes.\nAccolades.\nThe episode won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Directing and Writing for a Comedy Series for Todd Holland and Alex Reid, respectively, in 2001. Leading on from this, Holland won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series in 2002. Frankie Muniz was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for this episode."

The final was contested by Lézignan Sangliers, who had finished first in the league table and had beaten Limoux Grizzlies to reach the final, and Pia Donkeys who had finished second in the league table and had beaten Carcassonne to reach the final. The final was held at the Stade de la Méditerranée in Béziers on 17 May 2008.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nLézignan Sangliers won the match 26-16 after being 12-6 up at half-time, to win the championship for the first time in their history. However it was Pia who scored first with Maxime Grésèque kicking a penalty after 5 minutes for Pia to lead by two points. They further extended this lead with a try from Nicolas Piquemal, although the conversion was unsuccessful. In the 15th minute Australian halfback James Wynne kicked a penalty and also successfully kicked the conversion to Jared Taylor's try seven minutes later. Jared Taylor, who was top try scorer in the league, then scored another try to propel Lezignan to a 12–6 lead going into half time, despite Pia having been ahead 0–6.\nSecond half.\nJust after half time saw Lezignan's Manu Bansept pick up the only yellow card of the match, and the third for him that season. Within a minute Pia had levelled the score with Sebastien Martins, playing just his sixth match in 2008. Maxime Grésèque kicked the two points but was unable to do so in the 56th minute which saw Dean Bosnich score his eighth try of the season. This meant that Pia held a narrow four-point lead. However Lezignan proved once again why they finished top of the league, scoring two tries in the 64th and 69th minute from Frenchmen Franck Rovira and Gregory Mazard respectively. Nicolas Munoz, who finished top conversion scorer for the season, kicked both conversions successfully. With one minute to go he then kicked a penalty for Lezignan to seal the victory."

        "text": "Wellington Rugby League is the local sporting body responsible for the administration of Rugby league in the Greater Wellington region. It is responsible for the local competition of the same name, as well as its representative team, the Wellington rugby league team.\nDomestic Competition.\nThe Senior WRL competition involves 9 teams in the Premier Grade with most fielding a Reserve Grade team also:\nThe 5 other clubs that aren't in the Senior WRL are:\nThe winner is awarded the Appleton Shield, which has been in use since 1940. In 1912 four teams played for the Seigel Cup; Petone, Hutt, Athletic and Newtown. Petone won the first ever Wellington club competition.\nHistory.\nWellington played its first game on 24 August 1908 when they took on Auckland at Victoria Park, Auckland in the first provincial game of rugby league in New Zealand.\nDuring 1909, 1910 and 1911 Wellington continued to play a number of provincial games and, in 1909, defeated Auckland in Auckland, 22-19, the first of only five victories over Auckland in over 100 years.\nFoundation.\nThe Wellington Rugby League Association was officially formed on 23 May 1912 at the Trades Hall in Wellington when 1907-08 All Golds captain, Hercules Richard (Bumper) Wright presided over a meeting of 75 footballers and supporters, many of them prominent rugby union players in Wellington.\nThe founding committee was chaired by W J Riorden and included Daniel Fraser.\nPost War years.\nWill Appleton was president of the Wellington Rugby Football League between 1940 and 1958 and presented the Appleton Shield, which is used to this day as the premier club trophy.\n1990-1994 :Touring teams.\nIn 1990 Wellington defeated the touring Great Britain side 30-22. This is Wellington's only victory over a touring side.\n1994-2000: Lion Red Cup.\nBetween 1994 and 1996, Wellington was represented by the Wellington City Dukes and Hutt Valley Firehawks in the Lion Red Cup. One player from the Dukes, Earl Va'a, later went on to represent Samoa in Rugby union. Both teams folded along with the competition in 1996.\n2000-2007: Bartercard Cup.\nWellington initially had two sides in the Bartercard Cup competition - the Porirua Pumas and the Wainuiomata Lions, based in the city of Porirua and Lower Hutt suburb of Wainuiomata respectively. Results between the two were dissimilar - with Wainuiomata reaching the preliminary final in the first season, and Porirua coming last place in theirs. However, in 2002 it was decided that one team (later to be named the Wellington Orcas) was needed in the competition. They narrowly missed out on a finals spot in 2002, being on equal points but with a lower For and Against than the Marist Richmond Brothers. Unfortunately this was a high point for the franchise with the team never making the play-offs.\nIn 2006, the then-unnamed Bartercard Cup franchises adopted the name of Wellington Orcas, after the unsuccessful NRL expansion bid.\n2008-2009: Bartercard Premiership.\nThe Wellington Rugby League were awarded a place in the new six-team National Provincial Competition as the region Wellington. The team plays its home matches at Porirua Park.\n2010-present: NZRL National Competition.\nWellington Rugby League was then placed in the NZRL National Competition as the replacement competition for the Bartercard Premiership, known as the \"Wellington Orcas\".\nNRL Bid.\nIn 2004, working with the Wellington Rugby League, a consortium called the Southern Orcas was involved in bidding for a National Rugby League franchise to be based in the city. The franchise ultimately went to the Gold Coast who joined the NRL for the 2007 season.\nIn 2007 reports emerged that the consortium was looking at the possibility of joining Super League however nothing ever eventuated.\nNotable juniors competed in the NRL.\nRandwick Kingfishers\nUpper Hutt Tigers\nWellington Orcas"

This style, popularized by New Zealand, Tonga and Fiji, emphasizes back-play over forward play, and focuses on quick ball movement and a high work rate. Riverside R.C. is best known for winning back-to-back titles at the 2003 and 2004 USA Rugby Club Sevens National Championship.\nTeam Accomplishments.\nRiverside Rugby has distinguished itself with the following accomplishments:\nCapped Players.\nBeing selected to play for a national team is one of Rugby's highest honors. The following current and former Riverside players have played for a national team.\nCriticisms.\nRiverside has been a very inconsistent team. The club did not win in 2002. Two years later, Riverside was undefeated in 2004 in the highest SCRFU division. In 2006, the club again had the worst record in SCRFU, and was relegated. In 2008, the club won the white division, and made the play-offs.\nPlayer development.\nThere are many factors that can cause such inconsistent performance. One argument is that too much of Riverside's talent is concentrated in a few players. Over the years, Riverside has demonstrated an ability to recruit top-tier Fijian-American, Tongan-American and Samoan-American players. Some have argued that the club has not done enough to develop local talent, which makes it very dependent on these key players.\nClub status.\nAnother challenge for Riverside is that the club may is under-capitalized for the level of performance expected by Riverside fans. The more consistent high powered Southern California teams, such as OMBAC and Belmont Shores, are well capitalized, well run professional sports organizations, that can provide the training facilities and resources expected by top rugby professionals in the United States.\nSponsorship.\nUnlike the Super League, SCRFU does not have a national sponsor that shares operating costs with the teams. Riverside is supported by a combination of member dues and secondary sponsorships "
