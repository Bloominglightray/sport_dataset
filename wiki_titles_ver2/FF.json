Every athlete's leg is skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants all start at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane in the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five).\nThe single mixed relay involves one male and one female biathlete each completing two legs consisting of one prone and one standing shoot."

For the 1923 Tour de France, this system changed, and three categories were used: the \"first category\", of the top cyclist, the \"second category\", of lesser but still sponsored cyclists, and the \"touriste-routiers\", the quasi-amateurs.\nThe sponsors, who had joined forces in the previous tours under the name La Sportive, were now financially stable enough to have their own teams. Automoto, sponsor of the team with the Pélissier brothers, had commercial interests in Italy, so wanted to have Italian cyclists in the team. Several Italian cyclists were hired, who were supposed to come to France. Only one Italian cyclist showed up, Ottavio Bottecchia, who had started as a professional the year before. The sponsor then decided that the marketing plan would not work with only one Italian cyclist, and wanted to send him back. At the last minute, Bottecchia was allowed to stay on the team."

        "text": "The Emporia State Hornets basketball team represents Emporia State University in Emporia, Kansas, in the NCAA Division II men's basketball competition. The team is coached by Tom Billeter, who is in his first season as head coach. The Hornets compete in the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association.\nThe basketball team plays its home games in William L. White Auditorium downtown Emporia. Since joining the NCAA in 1991, Emporia State has only been to the NCAA Tournament twice: 2004 and 2007.\nOverview.\nThe Emporia State Hornets team annually plays a nineteen-game conference schedule that is preceded by an out-of-conference schedule that includes one exhibition game between the Kansas Jayhawks or the Kansas State Wildcats, switching every other year. The conference schedule consists of playing every MIAA member at least once, some twice. Emporia State does, however, play the Washburn Ichabods in the rivalry known as the Turnpike Tussle and the Pittsburg State Gorillas.\nHistory.\nEmporia State's basketball program was founded in 1901, thirty-eight years after the university was founded. Since 1901, the Hornets have belonged to six conferences. When the school was a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, they participated in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference, Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, Great Plains Athletic Conference, and the Central States Intercollegiate Conference. When the university was recognized as an NCAA Division II school in 1991, they joined the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA).\n1901–1918.\nEarl Carney was the first coach, earning a 10–29 record over six seasons from 1901 to 1907. The inaugural game was a 12–13 loss to the Florence Opera House, a team from Florence, Kansas. ESU would then clinch their first ever victory against the Florence Opera House later that year – 35–21. For the next two seasons, Paul Sampson took over the helm of the program, compiling a 20–8 record. Following Sampson was Fred Honhart for three seasons, who led the Normals (as the school's teams were known until 1921) to a 27–10 record from 1909 to 1912. From 1912 until 1918, Emporia State went through three coaches with a combined record of 58–45: George Crispin (1912–1914), Homer Woodson Hargiss (1914–1916, 1917–1918) and H. D. McChesney from 1916 to 1917. Due to World War I, Emporia State did not have a team from 1918 to 1920.\n1920–1943.\nIn 1920, Emporia State resumed sports after World War I ended. A.A. Schabinger, also known as Arthur Schabinger, led the Normals from 1920 to 1922. He had a combined record of 24–9. Homer Woodson Hargiss was the head basketball coach at Emporia State three times—first from 1914 to 1916, then from 1917 to 1918 and then from 1922 to 1923. During his total of four seasons, he garnered a record of 47–19. Vic Trusler was the only other coach at Emporia State to serve more than one time as the head basketball coach at the school. After having Schabinger and Hargiss at the helm, Trusler took the job from 1923 to 1925 and then again from 1927 to 1936. After serving as coach for two seasons, Llyod McGahn took the job for only two seasons with a combined record of 22–13. After McGhan left in 1925, Trusler again took the job, remaining in that position until 1936. He departed after leading his teams to 84 wins, 59 losses. From 1936 to 1943, Paul Kutnick lead the Hornets with a 66–60 record. Due to World War II, ESU had no team from 1943 to 1946.\n1945–1998.\nAfter starting the sports programs back up after World War II, Gus Fish served as head coach from 1946 to 1970 compiling a record of 323–279 () record. Fish led the Hornets to six conference championships, tied for another, and made six appearances in the NAIA national tournament, placing fourth in 1946 and 1964. While at ESU, Fish also served as the president of the NAIA in 1955 and helped establish the NAIA track &amp; field program. In 1960, Fish assisted with the U.S. Olympic basketball team as well as became a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame. Until 1990, Fish was the all-time winningest coach at Emporia State.\nRon Slaymaker took over the program when Gus Fish retired in 1970. Slaymaker is the winningest coach in Emporia State history, with a record of 452–348 (). After coaching for 28 years, Slaymaker's teams won a conference title five times and a district championship on four occasions. In 1986, his 31–5 record led him to be named the National Coach of the Year in the NAIA. He earned Coach of the Year for District 10 six times. Slaymaker served as an assistant coach for the U.S. Olympic Festival and the World University Games in the late 1980s. Slaymaker served as a member of the 1988 Olympic Basketball Selection Committee. He also led Emporia State to four NAIA National Tournament appearances.\nProgram declines: 1998–2011.\nAfter Slaymaker's retirement, Marc Comstock took over the job. After going 33–49 at Emporia State in three years, his contract was not renewed in 2001. Following Comstock was David Moe, son of former NBA player and coach, Doug Moe. In his ten seasons from 2001 to 2011, he led ESU to the NCAA Tournament in 2004 and 2007 and is one of just three coaches to take his team to every MIAA Post Season Tournament held in Kansas City. Those teams advanced to the semifinals of the tournament in four of the last six years. Moe is third most winningest coach in ESU history behind ESU Hall of Honor members Gus Fish and Ron Slaymaker, with a record of 162–126.\nFormer pro player takes over: 2011–2018.\nIn April 2011, Shaun Vandiver was hired as Emporia State's next coach. Vandiver returned to Wyoming as an assistant coach in April 2018. Vandiver ended with an overall record of 87–111, and a record of 51–90 in the MIAA.\nThree-time national champion takes reigns: 2018–present.\nIn April 2018, Craig Doty, a three-time national championship coach, was hired as Emporia State's next coach.\nVenue and culture.\nHome arena.\nSince 1940, home basketball games have been played at William L. White Auditorium, a 5,000-seat arena which is named after William Lindsay White, son of William Allen White. The auditorium is also home to the men's basketball team and the Lady Hornets volleyball team since the program started in 1973. In 2008, White Auditorium received an upgrade with a new scoreboard and video board, as well as a new color scheme on the arena floor and the throughout the entire building.\nSchool colors.\nEmporia State's official school colors are black and gold. They have been the colors since the school was founded in 1863, and until recently, the gold was Old gold.\nMascot.\nCorky the Hornet is Emporia State University's mascot. In 1923 when the Emporia State was named to the Kansas State Teachers College, the athletic teams were called the \"Yaps\". Many people, including most Emporia State coach Vic Trusler, did not like the name. Trusler suggested to a writer at the \"Emporia Gazette\" that the new name should be the \"Yellow Jackets\". But due to the lack of newspaper space, the name changed to \"Hornets\".\nIn 1933, the Teachers College had a student contest where students and staff could design a mascot for the college. Sophomore Paul Edwards, who graduated in 1937, designed Corky. Although hundreds of drawings were submitted, Edwards' Corky, a \"human-like\" hornet was selected. Corky was published in \"The Bulletin\", the student newspaper for Emporia State University."

Croatia, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland qualified by winning their playoffs.\nFour-time champions Italy did not qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, missing out on qualification for the first time since 1958 after losing in the playoffs to Sweden, while the three-time FIFA World Cup runners-up Netherlands did not qualify for the tournament for the first time since 2002 after finishing third in 2014, and second in 2010. Iceland, with 335,000 inhabitants, became the smallest country ever to qualify for a FIFA World Cup.\nEntrants.\nApart from Russia, which qualified automatically as hosts, all remaining 52 FIFA-affiliated national teams from UEFA at the registration deadline of January 2015 entered qualification.\nGibraltar, despite being a UEFA member since 2013, was not a FIFA member at the time of the registration deadline, and thus was not eligible to enter qualification for the FIFA World Cup. They appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to challenge FIFA's refusal to grant membership in order to enter World Cup qualifying. In May 2016, the CAS found in Gibraltar's favour and ordered that FIFA put Gibraltar forward for FIFA membership, which would permit Gibraltar to take part in the qualifiers if membership was granted.\nKosovo became a UEFA member on 3 May 2016, and together with Gibraltar, applied for membership in the FIFA Congress in 12–13 May 2016. FIFA confirmed that in the case both associations succeeded in becoming a member, they would be entitled to participate in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, with UEFA tasked to integrate them into the competition.\nOn 13 May 2016, both Kosovo and Gibraltar were officially admitted as FIFA members, thus allowing them to compete. UEFA created a task force to discuss how to integrate the two teams into the competition, and on 9 June 2016 UEFA announced that Kosovo would be assigned to Group I, to avoid meeting Bosnia and Herzegovina for security reasons, and Gibraltar would play in Group H.\nFormat.\nThe qualification structure was as follows:\nQualifying matches started in September 2016, following UEFA Euro 2016, and finished in November 2017.\nThe scheduling of qualifying matches, which were centralised by UEFA, followed the \"Week of Football\" concept first used for UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying:\nThe fixture list was confirmed by UEFA on 26 July 2015, the day following the draw.\nFirst round.\nSeeding.\nThe draw for the first round (group stage) occurred as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw on 25 July 2015, starting 18:00 MSK (), at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nThe seeding was based on the July 2015 FIFA World Rankings. The 52 teams were seeded into six pots:\nEach six-team group contained one team from each of the six pots, while each five-team group contained one team from each of the first five pots.\nDue to the centralisation of media rights for European qualifiers, England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands were all drawn into six-team groups. Netherlands and France were drawn together in Group A, and Spain and Italy were drawn together in Group G.\nIn consideration of the political relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, UEFA requested that FIFA maintain the current UEFA policy not to draw these teams into the same qualification groups (since the two teams were in the same seeding pot, this would not have happened regardless of the request).\nThe football associations of Gibraltar and Kosovo became members of FIFA after the draw had taken place but before any games had been played. It was decided that both would be added to the World Cup qualifying process in Groups H and I, making those groups up to six teams each; due to the disputed political status of Kosovo, for security reasons, it was decided that Kosovo could not play against Bosnia and Herzegovina or Serbia, which meant Kosovo was added to Group I and Gibraltar to Group H. Gibraltar and Spain had previously been kept separate from each other in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying as a result of the disputed status of Gibraltar.\nThe hosts Russia were originally to be partnered with five-team Group H for friendlies. However, with the admission of Kosovo and Gibraltar, all groups were filled to contain six teams and the Russia friendlies against Group H teams were cancelled. UEFA vice-president Hryhoriy Surkis said that the UEFA management would deal with the issue of finding opponents for Russia to play friendlies.\nRanking of second-placed teams.\nWhen the draw was made, groups H and I had one team fewer than the other groups so it was decided that matches against the last-placed team in each of the six-team groups would not be included in the ranking of the second-placed teams even after the admission of Kosovo and Gibraltar. As a result, only eight matches played by each team were counted in the second-placed table.\nThe eight best runners-up were determined by the following parameters, in this order:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSecond round.\nThe eight best group runners-up contested the second round, where they were paired into four two-legged (home-and-away) fixtures.\nSeeding and draw.\nThe draw for the second round (play-offs) was held on 17 October 2017, 14:00 CEST (), at the FIFA headquarters in Zürich, Switzerland. The eight teams were seeded by FIFA World Rankings published on 16 October 2017, rather than qualifying record, with the top four teams in Pot 1, and the remaining four teams in Pot 2. It so happened that the top four teams by qualifying record were the same as the top four by FIFA World Ranking. Teams from Pot 1 played teams from Pot 2 on a home and away basis, with the order of legs decided by draw.\nMatches.\nThe first legs were played on 9–11 November, and the second legs were played on 12–14 November 2017. The winners of each tie qualified for the World Cup.\nQualified teams.\nThe following 14 teams from UEFA qualified for the final tournament.\nTop goalscorers.\nBelow are full goalscorer lists for all groups and the play-off rounds:\nBranding.\nUEFA unveiled the branding for the qualifiers on 15 April 2013. It shows a national jersey inside a heart, and represents Europe, honour and ambition. The same branding was also used for the European qualifiers for the UEFA Euro 2016."

        "title": "Fulwell Golf Course",
        "text": "Fulwell Golf Course, operated by Fulwell Golf Club, is a golf course and centre comprising an 18-hole course located in Fulwell in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, west London. It is adjacent to the 9-hole Twickenham Golf Course, currently operated by a David Lloyd Club, which was separated from the original Fulwell Golf Course in the 1950s. Both courses are located on Metropolitan Open Land owned by, and leased from, the London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames.\nLocation.\nThe combined site comprising Fulwell and Twickenham golf courses, the David Lloyd Club, allotments, and Squires Garden Centre is bounded by the A305 Staines Road to the northwest, the B358 Sixth Cross Road to the north, the A312 Uxbridge Road and Burton Road to the southwest, and part of the Shepperton branch railway line and A311 Wellington Road to the east where the main entrance to Fulwell Golf Club is situated. Fulwell railway station is a short walk from Fulwell Golf Club's entrance.\nHistory.\nFulwell Park.\nThe area was farmed during the 17th and 18th centuries and the present day golf course comprised part of Blackmoor Farm and most of Slade Farm. The farmhouse building for the latter, \"Slade Lodge\", built and Grade II listed in 1990, is now the course manager's residence. The area of the present day course formed part of a larger estate which was purchased in 1871 by property developer, Charles James Freake, and renamed \"Fulwell Park\".\nIn 1904 a group of local golf enthusiasts established the club at Fulwell. Led by prominent local figure H. O. Stutchbury, they appointed former Captain of Mid-Surrey Golf Club, Harry Tomlinson, as chairman and leased from the Trustees of the Freake Estate, using for the course. Early club officials included Frederick Dixon-Hartland, Viscount Villiers\nand Dr.Reginald Langdon Down, son of Dr.John Langdon Down.\nEarly courses.\nThe initial course on the site comprised an “outer” 18-hole course for men and an “inner” for ladies and high handicappers. It was designed by John Henry Taylor and was similar to the layout at the Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club where Taylor was the professional. The par 80 course was a long course, with holes varying from 122 to 514 yards, and somewhat flat in appearance. The “inner” course was extended to 18 holes in 1906 making it just under in length with the longest hole being , formally opening for play on 19 November 1907. In 1921 Alister MacKenzie, the noted golf course architect, was contracted to extend and improve the outer course.\nPhil Gaudin was appointed as the first head golf professional at Fulwell in 1906, and he remained there until the start of World War I in 1914. Gaudin played a match there on 1 June 1906 against Taylor. Taylor led by 6 holes after the first round and eventually won 3&amp;2.\nGeorge Oke became resident professional at Fulwell in 1921 and, soon after, a young school-leaver, Leslie Cotton, joined as assistant. In 1923 Leslie's elder brother, Henry Cotton, joined as assistant teaching professional. Henry Cotton soon moved on but Oke remained until 1946.\nIn 1934 a consortium of Teddington Council, London County Council and Middlesex County Council indicated its intention to purchase the land under the green belt scheme on expiry of the lease in 1941.\nWorld War II.\nThe War Agricultural Executive Committee instructed the club to lay out the inner course to agricultural use. The resulting loss of half its membership revenue led to an agreement with the landowner, by then Middlesex County Council, to reduce the rent in return for opening up the remaining course to the public and with a commitment to reinstate the inner course after the war.\nThree bombs, intended for the nearby National Physical Laboratory, Teddington fell in the course during 25 February 1944.\nPost war.\nAfter the war, Middlesex County Council reinstated the course, contracting John Stanton Fleming Morrison for the design. He laid out the present day 18-hole course comprising eight of the original “outer” layout and ten new holes from the land returned from agricultural use. The par 71 course has four par 3, eleven par 4 and three par 5 holes. The new course opened in 1958 and the club was granted a further 21-year lease.\nIn 1946 Bill Cox succeeded George Oak as professional, establishing a successful teaching academy at Fulwell and remaining until 1975.\nOwnership and sale.\nOwnership of the land transferred to the Greater London Council. In April 1981 the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames purchased the freehold from the GLC for £159,750.\nIn March 1983 Richmond agreed to sell both the former Slade's Farm golf course site and adjacent Blackmore Farm site for a sum of £300,000 to D.J. Squires on a 999-year lease. Squires Garden Centre business was established on the Blackmore Farm site. The disposal was authorised both by the GLC and the Secretary of State for the Environment and the sale concluded in March 1986. Squires immediately reassigned the lease of the golf course to Fulwell Golf Club which continued the public play commitment established during the war through a reduced fee access agreement for local residents.\nThere was some local disquiet about the price achieved from the sale and complaints were made to the Local government ombudsman. From 1995 the matter was investigated by the District Auditor who issued a Public Interest Report in November 1999 that did not uphold the objections. A subsequent complaint to the Audit Commission against the District Auditor was upheld but a request for a further audit refused in 2002. In response to continued protest, the local authority established a scrutiny task force to investigate the allegations. In 2005 the task force published its report and found no evidence of wrongdoing but commented: Following publication of the report further documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act threw doubt on the scope of evidence considered by the task force. This resulted in a complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office that was upheld, however the inquiry’s findings were not materially changed.\nConsideration as a school site.\nIn 2018, a triangle of open land behind the David Lloyd Centre was formally assessed by Richmond Council to determine its suitability as a school site. The conclusion was that there would be several barriers to overcome, making it very difficult from a planning perspective.\nEnvironment.\nAnciently the area formed the southern extent of Hounslow Heath. The agricultural heritage of the site is still visible as drainage ditches and mature tree lines still reflect 19th century field boundaries.\nMore recently, efforts have been made to promote biodiversity on the site. Non-native Leyland cypress and Eucalyptus trees have been removed and habitats provided for stag beetles and hedgehogs.\nTwickenham Golf Course.\nWith the post-war redevelopment of Fulwell Golf Course in the late 1950s, the nine former \"outer course\" holes 7 to 15 to the north of the Fulwell site furthest from the Fulwell Golf Club clubhouse were given up for 'recreational purposes'. The intention was to provide hockey and football pitches, bowling green, tennis courts, an open-air swimming pool, gymnasium and café. The high cost of development led to delay and, instead, in 1975, the site was reinstated as a 9-hole public play and pay golf course, known as \"Twickenham Golf Course\" with access from the Staines Road. Part of the site became home to Thamesians RFC between 1982 and 1992.\nIn 2002 the site was transferred to Stax Leisure Ltd, (later acquired by David Lloyd Leisure), on a 125-year lease and was sub-let to the Gobafoss partnership, part of AXA in 2005. The 'Amida' sports and recreation facility was developed on the site in 2002 and a swimming pool added in 2011. In 2011 the site operator caused local controversy when access to a footpath crossing the site, popular with dog-walkers and part of a cycle route, was temporarily closed following claims of vandalism.\nThe present par 70 course comprises three par 3, four par 4 and two par 5 holes."

        "title": "1982 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game",
        "text": "The 1982 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game took place on Monday, March 29, between the North Carolina Tar Heels and Georgetown Hoyas at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The match-up was the final one of the forty-fourth consecutive NCAA tournament organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to crown a national champion for men's basketball at the Division I level.\nHead coach John Thompson and the Georgetown Hoyas entered the game ranked sixth in the final AP Poll (released three weeks earlier), with an overall record of The Hoyas were led by first-team All-American Eric Floyd and freshman Patrick Ewing. In the midst of a 15-game winning streak, the North Carolina Tar Heels entered the championship game at 31–2 after defeating the Houston Cougars in the national semifinal. The Dean Smith-led North Carolina Tar Heels were anchored by junior and first–team All-American James Worthy.\nThe game was televised by CBS across the United States, which attracted over 17 million viewers. Georgetown jumped out to an early 12–8 lead, with all eight of North Carolina's points coming from goaltending infractions by Ewing. The Hoyas entered halftime ahead 32–31. The teams traded the lead multiple times in the closing minutes of the second half. Following a turnover by Matt Doherty, Georgetown took the lead 62–61 courtesy of a jump shot from Floyd. During the ensuing possession, North Carolina freshman Michael Jordan hit a go-ahead basket with 15 seconds remaining to give the Tar Heels a one-point advantage.\nThe Tar Heels won their second NCAA men's basketball national championship, with their first coming in 1957. Worthy was named the Most Outstanding Player for his efforts throughout the tournament. After losing in his first three national title game appearances – something many had openly criticized him over – coach Smith won his first national championship as a head coach. Ewing helped lead the Hoyas back to the national title game in 1984 and 1985, where they won it all in 1984. Both talented freshmen, Ewing and Jordan, went on to become National Players of the Year before leaving college to play professional basketball.\nBackground.\nGeorgetown Hoyas.\nJohn Thompson was in the midst of his tenth season as head coach of the Georgetown Hoyas as the team entered the national championship game. Before the season, Thompson made headlines when he signed top recruit, Patrick Ewing over several other top name schools, along with Anthony Jones, Ralph Dalton, Elvado Smith, and Bill Martin. Georgetown was named by some voters as the number one team in the nation in the preseason polls due to its highly touted recruiting class. The Hoyas' starting lineup was Eric Smith, Eric Floyd, and Fred Brown as guards, Mike Hancock in the forward position, and Ewing at center.\nThe Georgetown Hoyas participated in the Great Alaska Shootout to start the 1981–82 season. The Hoyas lost their opening game to Southwestern Louisiana 70–61 after playing a sloppy game. After winning the following game against Alaska–Anchorage 77–67, the Hoyas lost 47–46 to Ohio State in their final tournament game. Georgetown then began a thirteen-game win streak, which was followed by losing three straight to three conference opponents. The Hoyas then finished the regular season with nine more wins and one loss, which was good enough to finish second in the Big East regular season standings. The Hoyas won their first two games of the Big East tournament by a collective margin of 29 points and advanced to the championship game against the Villanova Wildcats. The two teams were tied 33–33 at halftime, but the Hoyas changed their defense from zone to man-to-man to start the second half. This proved effective as they were able to force turnovers and shoot well from the field, which led them to win 72–54. The Georgetown Hoyas won the Big East tournament and also, a bid to the NCAA Tournament.\nIn the first round of the NCAA Tournament, Georgetown faced Wyoming and won 51–43. The Hoyas then beat the Fresno State Bulldogs by eighteen, after leading by five at halftime, to advance to the regional finals. Georgetown faced off against Oregon State in the regional final. In the game, the Hoyas shot very well from the field, setting the tournament record for field goal percentage in a game, 77.4%, en route to the 69–45 victory. In the national semifinal against Louisville, both teams shot very poorly. The two teams traded the lead several times throughout the first half, but after three minutes into the second half, Georgetown gained the lead and never relinquished it. The Hoyas used defense to maintain their lead and set the pace of the game, which they won 50-46. This was Georgetown’s second appearance in the national championship game. They previously made it in 1943, where they lost to Wyoming.\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels.\nThe North Carolina Tar Heels were coached by Dean Smith, who was in his twenty–first season as head coach of the Tar Heels. This was Smith's fourth national championship game appearance as the coach of North Carolina, after losing in 1968, 1977, and 1981. Coach Smith entered the 1981 regular season with what he called the \"best class he ever had\" to that point in his career with: Buzz Peterson, Warren Martin, Michael Jordan, Lynwood Robinson, and John Brownlee. His North Carolina team was named by many as the preseason number one and the favorite to win the national title. North Carolina's starting line up consisted of Jimmy Black and Jordan at the guard positions, Matt Doherty and James Worthy in at forward, and Sam Perkins as starting center.\nNorth Carolina opened their 1981–82 campaign with a win against Kansas at a neutral site in Charlotte, North Carolina. After winning five more games, the Tar Heels entered the Cable Car Classic. Behind Perkins' 23 points, the Tar Heels managed to win the game, despite being taken to overtime. North Carolina advanced to the tournament final where the defeated Santa Clara. Wake Forest defeated North Carolina, who was playing without Perkins due to illness, to hand them their first loss of the season. The Tar Heels won three more games before losing to Virginia, where they trailed the whole game. North Carolina won the remaining games of its regular season. The team won the ACC tournament by narrowly defeating Virginia in tournament's championship game, 47–45.\nNorth Carolina edged James Madison 52–50 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Tar Heels beat Alabama in the succeeding round to advance to the regional final against Villanova. North Carolina advanced to the Final Four with a 70–60 over Villanova as each starter scored over ten points. In the national semifinal, North Carolina was pitted against Houston. The Tar Heels opened the game with a 14–0 run. Houston overcame the deficit and tied the game at 29 just a few minutes before the half. Coming out of halftime, North Carolina went on a 7–2 run and eventually won the game 68–63 after stalling for a significant period of time.\nMedia coverage.\nIn the days before the game was to be played there was significant coverage given to the two head coaches Smith and Thompson. The two had both served as coaches on the 1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The two coaches first met in Washington D.C. while trying to recruit players from the same high school. Thompson was quoted saying that coach Smith \"knows our philosophy and I know his philosophy.\" Smith talked of Thompson saying he was a personal friend of his and that he would maintain contact with him whether or not Thompson was still coaching.\nThe relationship between Georgetown's Floyd and North Carolina's Worthy also drew some attention from the media. The two players grew up in Gastonia, North Carolina together, where they went to the same church and competed in high school against each other. Worthy commented that his family lives around two to three miles away from Floyd's. It was noted that the two would likely not interact much while playing as they did not play the same position.\nBoth coaches told the media that they believed their respective teams should play far better than they did in the National semifinal games if they wanted to win the upcoming game. Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown's shooting ability and feared that Floyd would come out shooting very well from the field. In addition, Smith noted that Ewing would play a large factor in the game because his defensive presence in the game limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown's opponents. Ken Rappoport of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high-percentage shots.\nVenue.\nThe Louisiana Superdome was chosen as the venue for the Final Four of the 1982 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The Superdome was selected over Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky. Throughout the 1970s, the NCAA had considered hosting the Final Four in a domed football stadium, and the 1982 Final Four was the first time the tournament was held in a domed football stadium since 1971, which was held in Houston’s Astrodome.\nBroadcast.\nThe national championship game was televised across the United States by CBS. CBS obtained the rights to broadcast the NCAA Tournament, after the tournament had been previously broadcast by NBC. A total of 17.52 million homes, 30% of the television audience, watched the game. The broadcast earned a 21.5 Nielsen Rating, the second highest for the NCAA national championship game at the time, after 1979.\nGame summary.\nThe game began with a tip–off between Georgetown's Patrick Ewing and North Carolina's Sam Perkins, which was won by Georgetown. Ewing made the first shot of the game from the baseline. On defense, Ewing was called for goaltending four times to give North Carolina their first eight points. Georgetown coach John Thompson ordered Ewing to \"make his presence known\" on defense and to not worry about goaltending calls when attempting to block shots. North Carolina did not physically make a shot until 8:08 had passed, at which point the score was 12–10 in favor of Georgetown. Eric Floyd proceeded to score four consecutive baskets for the Hoyas, while Worthy made six shots for the Tar Heels to tie the score at 22–22. The score at halftime was 32–31 in favor of the Hoyas, with ten of North Carolina's points coming off five goaltending calls on Ewing.\nThe teams traded baskets for the majority of the second half, with the largest advantage being four points by Georgetown with over twelve minutes to go in the game. After five more minutes of game play, North Carolina managed to cut the lead to two, 56–54. The Tar Heels then obtained a single point lead with 5:50 to play and set up in their four corners offense, to run out the game clock. The Tar Heels were quickly fouled and Jimmy Black converted two free throws, while Fred Brown made two his own on the other end to bring the score to 59–58 in favor of North Carolina. With three and a half minutes left in the contest, Michael Jordan drove to the basket and made a shot off of the backboard to increase the Tar Heels' lead to three, 61–58. On Georgetown's following possession, Ewing made a jump shot to bring his team within one. North Carolina again set up in the four corners. While making an attempt to steal the ball from Matt Doherty, the Hoyas' Eric Smith was called for a foul. This sent Doherty to the line for a one-and-one, which he missed and Ewing got the rebound. Floyd then hit a twelve-foot jump shot with 57 seconds left to go to give Georgetown the lead, 62–61. Then, Jordan received a pass from Black and connected on a shot with fifteen seconds remaining in the game to give North Carolina a one-point lead on his famous game-winning shot. On the Hoyas' ensuing possession, Fred Brown mistakenly passed the ball away to Worthy, who proceeded to run out some of the clock before being fouled by Smith. Because the officials called an intentional foul, Worthy received two free throw attempts, both of which he missed. Floyd got the rebound and attempted a last second shot that also missed.\nBox score.\nSource:\n&lt;br&gt;\nAftermath.\nNorth Carolina's James Worthy was named the NCAA tournament's Most Outstanding Player for his performance during the course of the tournament. Along with that honor, Worthy and Eric Floyd were both named Consensus First–team All-Americans for the 1981–82 season, while Tar Heel Sam Perkins was a Consensus Second–team All-American. Despite losing the game, John Thompson was given the United States Basketball Writers Association's Coach of the Year.\nFollowing the victory, Coach Smith received thousands of letters including the likes of boxer Sugar Ray Leonard and President of the United States Ronald Reagan, the latter of which invited the team to the White House. Smith's secretary Linda Woods told reporters that \"[Smith] answers everything\" and stated that they were \"2,000 letters behind in our correspondance.\" The visit to the White House was declined as the travel fares were not included.\nIn the days leading up to the national championship game, North Carolina head coach Dean Smith was a focal point of the media over his record in national championship games. Smith had coached the North Carolina Tar Heels to six Final Fours and three national title games before the 1981–82 season, all of which resulted in the Tar Heels failing to win the tournament. Due to these losses, Smith had earned a reputation for not being able to win the \"big game.\" When coach Smith won the national championship game against Georgetown, he silenced those who had criticized him before the game. Before retiring, coach Smith led the Tar Heels to one more national title victory in 1993.\nThe Georgetown Hoyas returned to the national championship game in 1984, where they faced off against the Houston Cougars and won 84–75. It was the first NCAA men's basketball national championship that Georgetown had won, along with the first that Thompson had won as head coach. Thompson embracing Brown in celebration after he ceremonially took each starter out of the game to give the bench players time in the championship game became an enduring image, as Thompson had had to console Brown after he had crucially thrown it away to Worthy in 1982. The following year, they again made it back to the national title game. This time, however, they lost to the eighth-seeded conference rival Villanova Wildcats.\nThe game featured two future National Players of the Year in Jordan and Ewing. The \"Sporting News\" named Jordan Player of the Year for the 1982–83 season. The following year, Jordan was the consensus National Player of the Year for the 1983–84 season, winning each of the player of the year awards that were given out. Ewing won four National Player of the Year awards for his efforts during the 1984–85 season. In addition, Worthy (2003), Ewing (2008), and Jordan (2009) were all enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame after illustrious NBA careers with the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls respectively including 9 NBA championships and were also all named to the NBA's 50 Greatest Players list in 1996 marking the league's 50th anniversary."

        "text": "The 2009 Australian Open Men's singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's singles tournament at the 2009 Australian Open. It was contested between the world's top two players for much of the previous four years, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, then ranked first and second in the world respectively. It was their seventh of nine meetings in a major final, and their first outside of either the French Open or Wimbledon. This was Nadal's first major hard court final, while it was Federer's ninth and at the time he was yet to lose in a major hard court final.\nNadal defeated Federer in five sets in 4 hours and 23 minutes, with the match finishing after midnight, becoming the first Spaniard, male or female, to win the Australian Open. Nadal would go on to win 13 years later in 2022, setting the record for the longest span between Grand Slam wins in the same tournament. The match was lauded as one of the greatest ever at the Australian Open, and came seven months after the pair contested the 2008 Wimbledon final, a match widely regarded as one of the greatest ever.\nMatch.\nPascal Maria was the chair umpire for the match. Nadal won the coin toss and elected to begin the match receiving.\nFirst set.\nFederer began the match serving and immediately gifted a break of serve to Nadal with a double fault and three unforced errors. Both men settled in well from there in the next game where Federer went ahead 15–30 after a forehand winner. Nadal fought back to deuce after saving a break point. Federer earned a second break point after three deuces, but did not convert it after a backhand error. Nadal then hit a forehand long to give Federer a third break point. The game lasted for ten minutes before Federer broke Nadal with a forehand winner to level the opening set at 1–1. Federer held serve with another forehand winner to get to 2–1. Nadal held comfortably to reach 2–2. In the fifth game at 30–30, Nadal's forehand was out but the linesman did not call it. Federer challenged and the Hawkeye review showed the ball was long, giving Federer 40–30 instead of break point to Nadal. Federer held at deuce to go ahead 3–2.\nAt 3–2 on Nadal's serve, Federer got to 30–30 after Nadal unsuccessfully challenged his own forehand that was long by about a millimetre. Federer hit a winner in the next rally to gain another break point. At 30–40, Federer hammered a return winner to break Nadal for the second time and gain a 4–2 lead. In the seventh game, Federer was unable to consolidate the break. Nadal hit a forehand winner to gain a break point opportunity in which Federer double faulted on to hand a second break to Nadal. Back on serve, Federer got to 30–30 the next game but Nadal held after Federer netted his next two returns. The set went to 5–5 where Nadal broke Federer for the third time in the set with a passing shot to go ahead 6–5. Nadal then served it out to win the first set 7–5. The set lasted 57 minutes and saw a wild pace of play with many long rallies. Federer was serving below his normal level which gave Nadal an early advantage.\nSecond set.\nThe second set saw more of the same pace. Nadal relentlessly kept on pummelling Federer's backhand hoping to draw errors. The set remained on serve until 2–2 where Nadal broke Federer to go ahead 3–2. Federer's first serve percentage was down to just 32% at this point. With the serve not working, Federer engaged in aggressive baseline rallies to compete with Nadal, constantly putting him on the defensive. Serving with a 3–2 lead, Nadal doubled faulted for the first time in the match. At 30–30, Nadal committed two errors to give Federer a break and level the set at 3–3. From there, Federer raised his game and held serve.\n4–3 saw a long and grueling game as Nadal fell behind 15–40 in his service game. He saved the first break point after a rally and saved the second one with an excellent serve. Federer got the advantage at deuce but Nadal saved the third break point with an ace. Federer fought back to gain a fourth break point that Nadal saved with a drop shot. Federer kept slugging and regained the advantage with a backhand winner during the next rally. He finally broke Nadal on his fifth break point of the game to gain a 5–3 lead. Federer then served out the set to take it 6–3 after winning four games in a row. Federer had gotten himself back into the match from the baseline and won the second set despite having a first serve percentage of just 37%.\nThird set.\nIn the third set, long rallies continued and both men held serve until 3–2 when Nadal gained the first break point of the set. Federer saved it after a grueling rally and went on to hold serve. At 3–3, Federer had an opening at 15–30 until he made 3 unforced errors to allow Nadal to hold. Federer held his next game relatively well to get to 4–4. Nadal then called for the trainer to massage his right thigh and the match saw a delay. After play resumed, Federer kept up his aggressive play to go ahead 0–40 and gain three break point chances. Two brutal rallies went Nadal's way, and at 30–40, he then caught Federer off guard with a serve to Federer's forehand to get to deuce. Nadal went on to hold with an ace and stay ahead 5–4. Federer held comfortably to get to 5–5 and Nadal once again called for the trainer.\nWhen play resumed, Nadal quickly fell behind again in his service game 15–40. Federer hit a forehand long at 30–40 to keep Nadal in the game and reach deuce. The ball was clearly out but Federer used a strategic Hawkeye challenge on the call in an attempt to rattle Nadal. Nadal then lost the next point at 40–40, which he too strategically challenged to no avail. Federer then gained another break point after the ruling, his sixth break chance in the set. Nadal saved it with a forehand winner and went on to hold and stay ahead 6–5. Nadal fought hard in the next game to break. Federer saved a set point and needed three deuces to finally hold for 6–6. The tiebreak went to 3–3 where Federer shanked a forehand to give Nadal a mini-break. Nadal then hit two winners to go ahead 6–3 and found himself with three set points. Federer double faulted to end the 78-minute set and Nadal went ahead two-sets-to-one.\nFourth set.\nFederer went back to work quickly holding serve to begin the fourth set. A backhand winner from Federer and an error from Nadal set up two break points in the next game. Federer converted with a forehand winner to break Nadal and go ahead 2–0. Nadal then broke back in the third game with two forehand winners at 30–30 to get back into the set. Federer showed an outburst of emotion for allowing this to happen as he fired a ball into the advertising boards. Nadal then held to put the set back on serve. The next game was another grueling affair on Federer's serve. At 2–2, Federer fell behind 15–40 and a big serve got him to 30–40 as Nadal's return went long. At this moment the umpire overruled the call, believing that Nadal's return was good. Federer challenged and the Hawkeye review confirmed the return was long. After a spat with the umpire, Federer saved the next break point with a backhand winner to get the game to deuce.\nThey battled on in the same game, Federer got the advantage but lost it after another brutal rally. Federer lost another advantage with a double fault. On the third deuce, Nadal regained a break point with a forehand. Federer tried to save it with a drop shot but Nadal got to it, yet he hit the ball wide to keep Federer in the game. Another rally at deuce ended with a fourth break chance for Nadal. Federer saved it with an ace, and then further saved a fifth break point with a forehand winner. After the seventh deuce Federer held serve to survive the game. At 3–2, Federer broke Nadal again to regain his break lead. He went ahead 5–2 after holding and Nadal then held to stay in the set. At 5–3 with Federer serving for the set at 15-all, a Federer ball was called out and Nadal appeared to have an opening. A Federer challenge saw the ball barely catch the line, giving Federer 30–15 instead of 15–30. He went on the hold from there and claimed the fourth set 6–3.\nFifth set.\nNadal served to open the fifth set with a hold. Federer held to get to 1–1, but showed signs of exhaustion as Nadal held easily to go ahead 2–1. From there, Nadal broke after two Federer backhand errors at 30–30 and gained a 3–1 lead. After Nadal's relentless onslaught on Federer's backhand for the better part of four hours, it finally broke down as the clock struck midnight in Melbourne. Serving at 3–1, Nadal raced ahead to a 40–0 lead. Federer fought back to 40–30 but Nadal got the hold to stay ahead 4–1. Federer then held at love to get back to 4–2. Federer lost the next game with another backhand error and Nadal lead 5–2.\nFederer served to stay in the match, but committed a double fault at 0–15 to put Nadal two points away from victory. At 15–40, Federer saved a championship point with a good serve. At 30–40, Federer saved the second one after a long rally ended with a Nadal error. At deuce, a long rally saw Nadal create a third championship point with a backhand winner. One last rally ensued that saw Federer run around his backhand three times to hit a forehand. The contest finally came to an end as Federer's final forehand barely went long. The match ended at 12:14 AM as Nadal fell to the court in disbelief that he had won the Australian Open.\nStatistics.\nThe match statistics followed a similar pattern to those at the 2008 Wimbledon final, with Federer having a lower first serve percentage against Nadal (51% compared to 64%) and again he was not as clinical on break point opportunities with only 31% break points converted for Federer whereas Nadal converted 43% of his break points. However, the total points by each player proved even closer than that at the aforementioned Wimbledon final, as Federer won one more point than Nadal (174 to 173) yet still lost this final.\nSignificance.\nIt was a match of great significance for Federer, who had the opportunity to equal the all-time record of Grand Slams won, which at the time was fourteen (set by Pete Sampras). Federer simultaneously could have equaled the then Open Era record for the most Australian Open titles at four each with Andre Agassi (the record has since been broken by Novak Djokovic with ten Australian Open titles). Further, Federer had entered the match with an 8–0 record in hard court Grand Slam finals. The loss saw Federer fall short of equaling both as his undefeated record in hard court Major finals came to an end. The loss further brought about immediate doubt by some analysts who believed that Federer might never equal Sampras' record. This was Federer's first and only Australian Open final loss in his career (6–1 overall record). However, Federer would go on to equal both of the records within the following twelve months after the loss. Federer came back the next year and reclaimed the Australian Open title, winning his sixteenth major and fourth title in Australia.\nAs a result of his win, Nadal set his own records by holding three of the four Grand Slam titles at the same time for the first time in his career. Upon winning this final, it was Nadal's sixth major win and his first on a hard court. He also became the first man in the Open era to hold three Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces simultaneously, in addition to winning the Gold Medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. This Australian Open win for Nadal remains especially important as it his first win in Melbourne, which is an essential piece of his Career Grand Slam. Nadal eventually made it back to five more Australian Open finals in 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2019 and finally won it again in 2022. This also saw Nadal become the second man (after Djokovic) in the Open era to achieve a double Career Grand Slam, winning each of the majors at least twice in singles.\nThe defeat brought Federer to tears as he came to terms with his loss. Following the final, tennis analyst Bud Collins proposed that Federer might never win another major as long as Nadal was playing tennis. For years this was partially true in the sense that Federer won four majors since this final, but indeed had not beaten Nadal in three subsequent Grand Slam meetings. Federer lost to Nadal once more at the French Open finals in 2011, and Federer lost to Nadal twice more at the Australian Open semifinals in 2012 and 2014. It would not be until the 2017 Australian Open that two would meet again in a Grand Slam final, that time ending in the 35-year-old Federer's five-set victory that claimed his 18th singles major and subsequently set new tennis records from it.\nUntil his 2017 Australian Open victory, Federer had not beaten Nadal in a Grand Slam since the 2007 Wimbledon final, and many analysts pointed to the 2009 Australian Open final as the match which severely compromised Federer's belief that he could win against Nadal in a major. Mats Wilander proposed that Federer had developed a mental block while playing against Nadal and that their rivalry had become one-sided and predictable after this match. Tennis Channel commentator Justin Gimelstob referred to Federer's loss as a type of 'collateral damage' in which Federer not only lost a tennis match but also lost his last remaining stronghold to Nadal, having lost major finals to him on clay, grass, and hard courts in succession.\nAs such, many believed that Nadal's victory over Federer would bring about a permanent change in the tennis rankings, as Nadal was then clearly the number-one player over Federer after the Swiss had held that title for over four-and-a-half years consecutively with Nadal being the second-best for nearly three years of that. Later in the year, however, Nadal would lose at the French Open for the first time when he lost to Robin Söderling in the fourth round. Söderling would eventually reach the final, before losing to Federer, who by winning the French Open for the first (and only) time completed his own Career Grand Slam and equalled Pete Sampras' then-record of 14 Major titles. Nadal later withdrew from Wimbledon due to a knee injury, while Federer, who lost to Nadal in the previous year's final, would regain the title after outlasting Andy Roddick 16–14 in a five-set epic and return to world number one in the rankings, displacing Nadal who dropped to No. 2 as a result of being unable to defend the Wimbledon title which he won in 2008. Just as Federer rebounded during the rest of 2009, Nadal would return from injury in 2010 to win 3 consecutive grand slams, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open (completing his Career Grand Slam at a record 24 years of age).\nNadal and Federer about the match.\nDuring the trophy presentation.\nBesides the 2008 Wimbledon Final, this match is still considered to be one of Federer's most devastating career losses. During the runner-up speech, Federer found himself in tears as he tried to speak. \"Maybe I'll try later again I don't know. God it's killing me,\" Federer said before breaking down and stepping aside. Nadal then received the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup and put his arm around Federer, encouraging him to take to the microphone again. Federer stepped forward and finished his speech. \"I don't want to have the last word. This guy deserves it. So, Rafa, congrats. You played incredible. You deserve it, man,\" Federer said. \"I'd like to thank the legends for coming out. You know how much it means to me.\"\nNadal then addressed Federer as he took to the microphone. \"Well first of all, sorry for today,\" he said to Federer. \"I really know how you feel right now. It’s really tough. Remember, you’re a great champion. You’re one of the best of history.\" During his speech, Nadal further stated that Federer would recover from the loss to go on and break Sampras' record of fourteen Grand Slam titles in due time. Federer did exactly that at the following two Grand Slam tournaments, first equalling the record at the French Open and then breaking it at Wimbledon by winning his fifteenth major. Nadal was also able to surpass Sampras’ record several years later.\nAfter the match.\nDuring the post-match press conference Federer admitted that he played a subpar fifth set and felt that the match should have never gone to five sets. \"Maybe I should have never been there, you know, in the first place. I think he played well. I definitely played a terrible fifth set, you know. I kind of handed it over to him.\" Federer was further asked if he believed he could ever beat Nadal in a major final again. He responded, \"Yeah, for sure. I didn't spend four and a half hours out there [not] believing it. \nNadal's uncle and coach Toni later echoed this sentiment and felt that the match should have been over in three or four sets, and suggested that Federer has lost his belief while playing against Nadal. \"The key difference in the match [then] was that in the final set Roger's level fell and Rafa was able to maintain his level,\" he said. Nadal felt that surviving the third set and winning it in a tiebreaker was the pivotal point of the match. \"Winning the third was vital. It would have gotten very complicated if I had lost that set.\" Regarding Federer's breakdown during the trophy presentation, Nadal said he understood what Federer was feeling. "

Carroll scored all of the Vols points, adding a field goal in between touchdowns. Irby Curry scored all of Vanderbilt's points. An account of the first Tennessee touchdown reads, \"Four minutes of play had barely drifted by when Tennessee's weird, mystic, elusive forward pass, May to Carroll, deadly in accuracy, went sailing home for the first touchdown of the game. The chesty Tennessee quarterback sent the oval whizzing for a distance of thirty-five yards and Carroll gathered in the ball near his goal line, when he hurried beneath the posts with all the speed at his command.\""

        "text": "Annie Miller (born January 19, 1977) is a retired American professional tennis player. Miller attained a career high singles ranking of 40 on 21 September 1998. She is best known for being the first opponent of Serena Williams in Williams' professional career, Miller winning the match 6–1, 6–1. She also has wins over Lindsay Davenport, Mary Pierce, Kimiko Date and Jana Novotná.\nEarly life and education.\nMiller was raised in Michigan. In 1995, Miller graduated from Bradenton Academy with honors.\nTennis career.\nMiller began playing tennis for fun when she was five years old. At 16, she received a scholarship to attend the former Nick Bolletieri Tennis Academy. After a successful junior career, she began playing the USTA circuit at age 15, and at 18, she began playing tennis professionally. She played right-handed (double handed backhand).\nAt the time when Miller started thriving in professional tennis – at the age of 21, a mere four years into her career – she took an indefinite leave of absence from the Women’s Tennis Association. This was the best season of her career, with her solid run to the third round of the U.S. Open, which was her personal best, ranking her Number 43 in the world.\nMiller also beat both Lindsay Davenport (who was Number 7 in the world) and Mary Pierce, which earned her reputation for being a “young player on the rise.” When she played at the Open against Monica Seles – a game that was televised – she accrued a whole slew of new fans, due to her impressive playing and attractiveness.\nMiller was a member of both the U.S. Maureen Connolly Brinker Cup team and the U.S. National Team in 1991–92.\nPost-tennis life.\nAfter the 1998 US Open, Miller made the decision to attend college at University of Michigan, where she received a Bachelor in Business Administration (BBA) and Master of Accounting degree at University of Michigan Ross School of Business. \nFollowing her tennis career, she worked at Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Fenway Sports Group (now Fenway Sports Management), and Adidas.\nAwards.\nIn a 1991 junior competition, Miller won the U.S. National 16s and 1992 Easter Bowl 18s. The following year she received the Clairol/WTA Tennis Scholarship at the U.S. Open. Two years later, she received the 1994 International Hall of Fame Sportsmanship Award."

The game was held on at the Special Events Center (now the Jon M. Huntsman Center) at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nIn the game, the Indiana State Sycamores of the Missouri Valley Conference faced the Michigan State Spartans of the Big Ten Conference. The Sycamores entered the contest undefeated for the season, while the Spartans had six losses. Spartans guard Magic Johnson and Sycamores forward Larry Bird competed against each other for the first time; the pair developed a rivalry in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the 1980s.\nMichigan State won to claim the school's first national championship in men's basketball. The 1979 NCAA tournament final had the highest Nielsen ratings of any game in the history of American basketball.\nBackground.\nIndiana State Sycamores.\nThe Sycamores were not ranked in the Associated Press (AP) or United Press International preseason polls, and coaches in their Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) did not pick them to win the league. The team, which had been coached by Bob King in was led by senior forward Larry Bird, who had averaged 30.0 points per game during the previous season (second in NCAA Division I basketball) and been named an All-American in 1978. Indiana State's lineup also featured Carl Nicks, a junior guard who was returning to the school after spending his sophomore season at Gulf Coast Community College. However, the four starters from the 1977–78 team other than Bird had graduated. Before the start of the season, King suffered a heart attack and left the job; he was replaced by Bill Hodges. The Sycamores won their first game versus Lawrence University by a score of 99–56, and followed that performance by traveling to Purdue and winning by 10 points. Bird scored 40 points in Indiana State's next contest, a 74–70 victory at Evansville. That began a streak of seven games in which Bird scored over 30 points, including a 48-point effort against Butler.\nIndiana State entered the AP poll at number 20 on December 12, rising as the season progressed and the team remained unbeaten. One challenge came during a game against Bradley, which elected to play with a triangle-and-two defense that Bradley coach Dick Versace called the \"Bird Cage\". The alignment was effective in containing Bird, who scored four points (his lowest total for Indiana State) on two field goal attempts; the Sycamores, however, managed to win. By February 13, the Sycamores were the top-ranked team in the country, and they held that position in the final rankings. Indiana State won all 16 of its games against MVC competition. The Sycamores were the number one seed in the Midwest region of the NCAA Tournament, and began their run in the event with an 86–69 second-round win over Virginia Tech. A 93–72 win over Oklahoma followed, and a two-point victory against Arkansas gave Indiana State a Final Four spot.\nIn the national semifinal against DePaul, Bird made 16 of 19 field goal attempts and had 16 rebounds and 9 assists. In a close game, Indiana State won to reach the final without a loss on the season, at \nMichigan State Spartans.\nCoached by Jud Heathcote, Michigan State featured sophomore Magic Johnson, who had been instrumental in helping the team win the Big Ten Conference championship the previous season. It was their first solo conference title since 1958–59; the Spartans reached the regional finals at the 1978 NCAA Tournament, but lost by three points to eventual champion Kentucky. The team also had Greg Kelser, who was later chosen in the first round of the NBA draft. Writer Michael Wilbon said that entering the season, the team was \"talented but seemed just a little less than they should have been in the Big Ten\". The Spartans began the season with three straight wins, then lost by a point, 70–69, at North Carolina. Michigan State followed that defeat with six consecutive wins, and was top-ranked in the AP poll in early January. However, the team lost consecutive games to Illinois and Purdue (both losses coming on jumpers in the closing seconds), causing it to fall five places in the poll. Afterwards, the Spartans posted a blowout victory over Indiana and a win in overtime over Iowa. Ranked third in the AP poll following those games, the Spartans lost at Michigan 49–48, as Keith Smith made the winning free throw with no time remaining.\nIn their next game, an unheralded Northwestern team handed Michigan State its worst defeat of the season, beating them 83–65 for their fourth loss in six games. After that game, they faced Ohio State in a contest that required overtime; the Spartans emerged with an 84–79 win. That led to a winning streak; Michigan State ran off wins in their next nine games, defeating four of the teams that had beaten them in the process. Wisconsin snapped the Spartans' streak in their final game before the NCAA tournament, winning 83–81 on a long-range shot at the buzzer. The Spartans' 13–5 Big Ten record put them in a three-way tie with Iowa and Purdue for first in the conference, and they won 21 of 27 games in all regular season play; their final AP poll ranking was third.\nMichigan State was awarded the second seed in the Mideast Regional for the NCAA Tournament, and defeated the Lamar Cardinals 95–64 in their first game, held in the second round. The Spartans advanced to the regional semifinal, where they topped third-seeded LSU 87–71. In the regional final, the Spartans defeated the Mideast region's top seed, Notre Dame, by a 12-point margin to advance to the Final Four, where they faced Penn. Michigan State won in the national semifinals 101–67 to gain a berth in the NCAA title game. Johnson had a triple-double in the contest, posting 29 points, 10 assists, and 10 rebounds. Entering the national championship game, they had a 25–6 record.\nBroadcasting.\nThe 1979 NCAA Final Four, which included the national championship game, was televised by NBC. Announcing duties were performed by Dick Enberg, Al McGuire, and Billy Packer, while the halftime show was hosted by Bryant Gumbel. The Nielsen ratings for the championship game were 24.1; this figure is the highest for any basketball game in the United States as of 2017. The estimated audience was around 40 million people in 18 million households, and the number of viewers increased 20 percent from the 1978 NCAA Tournament final.\nGame summary.\nThe national championship game took place on March 26. The Spartans gained control of the ball after the opening tip-off, only for Johnson to commit a traveling violation by making contact with the feet of Indiana State's Brad Miley. The Sycamores scored the first basket of the game, which was made by Steve Reed. The two teams played a close game in the early stages; a successful shot by Bird gave Indiana State a one-point advantage, and Michigan State called a timeout after his shot. The Spartans took a 9–8 lead on a basket by guard Terry Donnelly four minutes and twenty-six seconds into the contest. Michigan State used that play to begin a scoring run, outpointing Indiana State 9–0 during the stretch, which included a three-point play by guard Mike Brkovich. The Spartans' game plan on defense was to converge on Bird when he neared the baseline, in an effort to prevent him from receiving the ball. In addition, their strategy led to multiple instances in which Bird became uncertain as to whether he should pass or attempt a shot. Bird's effectiveness was limited, but Michigan State's players committed numerous personal fouls; both Johnson and Kelser had three fouls in the first half and were forced to leave the game. Despite their foul issues, the Spartans extended their lead over the Sycamores to 12 as the first half neared its end. After 20 minutes of play, Michigan State held a 37–28 advantage.\nTo begin the second half, Kelser made a shot six feet from the basket. Including those two points, the Spartans scored seven consecutive points to bring their lead to 16. Donnelly contributed four straight field goals as the Spartans' lead climbed to 50–34. Indiana State began to rally at this point, with two made field goal attempts each for Bird and Bob Heaton. While Michigan State's lead remained around 10 points, Kelser's foul troubles worsened when he committed his fourth of the game 4:27 into the second half. Michigan State was forced to remove him for reserve Jay Vincent, who was suffering from a foot bruise. In 19 overall minutes of playing time, Vincent had four fouls himself. Indiana State focused on playing close to the opposing basket while Kelser was out of the game, and Bird keyed a Sycamores scoring run with two field goals and a free throw. With 10:05 remaining, the Spartans' lead had been cut to 52–46. Kelser was brought into the game in response to the run, and did not commit another foul until the end. He and Johnson were responsible for the next eight points scored by the Spartans. The run included a four-point play by Johnson; he had a slam dunk while being fouled by Heaton, and sank two free throws that were awarded because Heaton was judged to have undercut him. For the last five minutes of the game, the Spartans held the ball for long periods to burn time off the clock. Bird received a technical foul call for one play in which he illegally stole the ball from Johnson while he was attempting an inbounds pass and attempted to score. Behind an offense that missed only 4 of 16 second half field goal attempts, Michigan State clinched its first men's basketball national championship by a 75–64 final score. Johnson was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, having scored 53 points on 17-of-25 shooting during the Final Four.\nStatistical summary.\nJohnson led all scorers in the national championship game with 24 points on 8-of-15 shooting. Kelser added 19 points and led the Spartans with 8 rebounds, one more than Johnson. Donnelly was the only other Michigan State player to score in double figures; he made all five of his field goal attempts and ended the game with 15 points. Ron Charles, Vincent, and Mike Brkovich were the other Spartans players to score points; each player contributed between five and seven points to Michigan State's total. Overall, the Spartans made 26 of their 43 shots.\nFor the Sycamores, Bird was the team's leading scorer with 19 points, but missed on two-thirds of his 21 field goal attempts. Bird was also the top rebounder for either side in the game, recording 13 rebounds. Nicks made half of his 14 shots and scored 17 points, while Heaton added 10 points. Four other players contributed points for Indiana State, but the team was successful on only 27 of its 64 field goal attempts. The Sycamores' free throw shooting was worse than Michigan State's; Indiana State missed 12 of its 22 attempts, while the Spartans had 10 misses in 33 free throws taken. The free throw scoring differential was thus greater than the margin of victory.\nAftermath.\nWilbon has credited the 1979 NCAA championship game with increasing interest in the NCAA Tournament, which underwent two field expansions in the following decade. Bird and Johnson both turned professional after the 1978–79 college season, and wound up playing for the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, respectively. The 1979 NCAA championship game was the first encounter in a rivalry that developed as the two continued their careers. The Celtics and Lakers met three times in the NBA Finals during the 1980s, and the pair helped to increase national interest in the NBA. ESPN's Andy Katz wrote that Bird and Johnson \"helped create the interest in the Final Four and they made today's NBA\"."

        "text": "The Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre (\"Portuguese School of Equestrian Art\") is a Portuguese institution dedicated to the preservation of the equestrian arts, in the Portuguese tradition. It is one of the \"Big Four\", the most prestigious classical in the world.\nHistory.\nThe school's origins as an institution trace to 1726, during the reign of King João V of Portugal, as the \"Real Academia Equestre da Corte\" (Royal Equestrian Academy of the Portuguese Royal Court), which served as the riding school of the Portuguese Royal Family and the Portuguese nobility. However, prior to its formal creation, the riding school of the Portuguese Royal Family had long been one of the most respected in Europe, since the publication of the seminal \"\"Bem Cavalgar\" by King Duarte I of Portugal in 1438.\nDuring the reign of King José I of Portugal, the 4th Marquis of Marialva served as the \"Estribeiro-Mor\" (Master of the Horse) of the royal household and the Equestrian Academy of the Court. Marialva pioneered the Portuguese tradition of equestrianism (sometimes called the Marialva Tradition or \"Arte Marialva\") and is considered a founding father to the school and the Portuguese tradition. Likewise, his 1790 work \"\"\" is considered the magnum opus of study in the school to this day.\nIn 1807, the Equestrian Academy of the Court was transformed into the \"Real Picaria Portuguesa\" (Royal Portuguese Riding Academy). In 1821, the school and its property nationalized and made into an institution of the state and not of the royal family. became Director of the Real Picaria Portuguesa in 1855 and later the private instructor to King Carlos I of Portugal. However, it was during the reign of King Carlos I that the Real Picaria became dormant, at the end of the 19th century.\nThroughout the dormant period of the school's history, the Portuguese tradition was practiced and maintained in private equestrian academies and \"picadeiros\". The school's history restarted in 1979, with the founding of the \"Escola Portuguesa da Arte Equestre\" as the successor institution of the Real Picaria Portuguesa.\nMission.\nThe primary directives of the Portuguese School of Equestrian Art are the conservation of the Lusitano horse, also known as the Pure Blood Lusitano, and the maintenance of classical Portuguese Baroque horsemanship. The Lusitano is an Iberian horse of Baroque stock famed for its prominence and strength in dressage and Portuguese-style bullfighting. It is the goal of the Portuguese School to preserve classical dressage (Haute ecole) of the Portuguese tradition.\nAdministration.\nThe academy and training grounds of the Portuguese School are based at Queluz National Palace, in Sintra, on the Portuguese Riviera, outside of Lisbon. The school also maintains the \"Picadeiro Henrique Calado\" riding hall in Belém, Lisbon, originally built in 1833 for Queen Maria II of Portugal's Lancers Regiment.\nThe academy consists of 17 riders, called \"cavaleiros\" (\"horsemen\" or \"knights\"). The Director of the Portuguese School is Lt. Col. Paulo Candoso. The school's \"Mestre Picador Chefe\" (Chief Master Rider) is currently João Pedro Rodrigues.\nHorses.\nThe Portuguese School of Equestrian Art exclusively uses Lusitano horses bred from the Alter Real State Stud, established in 1748 by King João V of Portugal to provide horses for use by the Portuguese Royal Family and by the Royal Equestrian Academy. Lusitanos were used by the royal family for performing classical dressage and competing in the \"Jogos da Corte\", the Royal Court Games (tournaments held between the 16th and 19th centuries to commemorate festivities)."

        "text": "In response to the finish in 1981, for the 1982 Tour de France, French minister of sports Edwige Avice objected to the amount of advertising in the race, and suggested the Tour to return to the national team format. The Tour organisation needed the money brought in by the sponsors, and no changes were made to the team structure.\nThe Tour organisation decided to start with 17 teams, each with 10 cyclists, for a total of 170, a new record. Tour director Félix Lévitan suggested to reduce the number of cyclists by starting with teams of 9 cyclists, but this was rejected.\nTeams could submit a request to join until 15 May 1982. To promote cycling in the United States of America, the American national cycling team would automatically be accepted, but the American team made no request.\nThe following 17 teams each sent 10 cyclists, for a total of 170:\nHinault, who had won the Tour in 1978, 1979 and 1981, and left the 1980 Tour in leading position, was the clear favourite for the victory. In those other years, Hinault had won several races before the Tour, but in 1982 he had only won one major race, the 1982 Giro d'Italia. Hinault tried to be the fourth cyclist, after Fausto Coppi, Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx, to win the Giro-Tour double.\nNotable absent was Lucien Van Impe, who was second in the 1981 Tour de France, winning the mountains classification. Since the 1969 Tour de France, Van Impe had started each edition, winning the general classification in the 1976 Tour and the mountains classification five times. Van Impe wanted to join, but his team Metauro was not invited, as the organisation considered it not strong enough to ride both the Giro and the Tour. Van Impe tried to find a team to hire him only for the 1982 Tour, but was not successful."

        "text": "A Twenty20 International (T20I) is an international cricket match between two teams, each having T20I status, as determined by the International Cricket Council, the sport's world governing body. In a T20I, the two teams play a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of 20 overs. The format was originally introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board for the county cricket competition with the first matches contested on 13 June 2003 between the English counties in the Twenty20 Cup. The first T20I took place on 17 February 2005 when Australia defeated New Zealand by 44 runs at Eden Park in Auckland.\nA five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, especially in the Twenty20 format, as bowlers can bowl no more than four overs in an innings. The first five-wicket haul in a T20I match was taken by Pakistan's Umar Gul while playing against New Zealand at The Oval during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20. 17 players have taken five-wicket haul twice.\nFive bowlers have taken a five-wicket haul on T20I debut. Tanzania's Yalinde Nkanya has taken the most economical five-wicket haul with an economy rate of just 0.50. He ended with the figures of 5/2 in 4 overs. The least economical five-wicket haul was taken by Joshua Rasu of Vanuatu with an economy rate of 12.70. He ended with the figures of 5/36 in 2.5 overs. Tomakanute Ritawa of Cook Islands is oldest player to take five wickets in an T20I innings, achieving the feat at the age of 46 years, while Kepler Lukies of Philippines, is the youngest at 16 years. \n, 143 five-wicket hauls have been taken by 126 different players. South Africa lead the list with 8 five-wicket hauls."

After there had not been an official Italian team allowed in the previous edition, the Italians were back. The Italian cyclists was divided between Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi. Both argued in the preparation for the race about who would be the team leader. The Tour organisation wanted to have both cyclists in the race, so they allowed the Italians and Belgians to enter a second team. In the end, Coppi refused to participate, and Bartali became the team leader. The organisation still allowed the Italians and Belgians to enter a second team, but they were to be composed of young cyclists, and were named the Italian Cadets and the Belgian Aiglons.\nThe Tour organisation invited the Swiss to send a team, as they wanted Ferdinand Kübler, the winner of the 1948 Tour de Suisse, in the race. Kübler refused this because he could earn more money in other races. When the brothers Georges and Roger Aeschlimann announced that they wanted to join the race, they were quickly accepted, especially because they were from Lausanne, where the Tour would pass through. They were put in a team with eight non-French cyclists living in France, and were named the Internationals.\nTwelve teams of ten cyclists entered the race: Belgium, Dutch/Luxembourg, Internationals, Italy, France, Belgian Aiglons, Italian Cadets, Centre–South-West, Ile de France–France-North-East, West-France, Paris and France-South-East. There were 60 French cyclists, 24 Italian, 22 Belgian, 6 Dutch, 4 Luxembourgian, 2 Swiss, 1 Polish and 1 Algerian cyclist."

Altogether this made 120 cyclists.\nThere were 57 French cyclists, 22 Italian, 18 Belgian, 6 Dutch, 6 Luxembourg, 6 Spanish, 6 Swiss and 1 Polish cyclist.\nIn the previous year, Fausto Coppi refused to enter the Tour de France because of personal problems with his teammate Gino Bartali. Bartali had won the previous Tour, and was trying to equal Philippe Thys by winning the Tour three times. Coppi had won the 1949 Giro d'Italia, and wanted to be the first one to achieve the Tour-Giro double in one year. The Italian team manager Alfredo Binda convinced them two weeks before the start of the race to join forces, so both Italians were in the race."

The New Zealand national rugby league team played a match against the Leeds Rhinos and competed in a three match test series against England for the Baskerville Shield, losing 2-1.\nBackground.\nNew Zealand had originally intended to host a tour against France, while Australia was speculated to host a Great Britain Lions tour. However the Australian Rugby League Commission declined to host a tour and as an alternative the Rugby Football League invited the New Zealand Rugby League to tour Great Britain for a three match series.\nNew Zealand was last in the United Kingdom for the World Cup in 2013.\nOn 25 February 2015, the three test match venues were confirmed with Hull's KC Stadium hosting game one on 1 November, the London Olympic Stadium hosting the second test on 7 November and the final test match being held at Wigan's DW Stadium on 14 November.\nThe match against Leeds was the first time a Super League side had played a touring side since 2002, when the Kiwis played matches against Hull F.C. and St. Helens. It was the first time that Leeds played New Zealand since 1992. The match celebrated the 125th anniversary of Headingley Rugby Stadium. Leeds has defeated New Zealand once in eleven matches between the two teams.\nSquad.\nTraining squad.\nAn initial training squad was named on 8 September 2015 and added to as teams were eliminated from the NRL finals. Kieran Foran was among those initially named but he later withdrew due to injury, joining Shaun Johnson, Thomas Leuluai, Manu Vatuvei, Dallin Watene-Zelezniak and Jared Warea-Hargreaves as being unavailable for the tour. Skipper Simon Mannering was also later made unavailable for the test series due to injury.\nFinal squad.\nThe final touring squad of 23 players was named on 8 October.\nOn 10 October, Jason Taumalolo withdrew from the touring 23-man squad due to a knee injury. He was replaced by Manaia Cherrington. Curtis Rona left the tour after the second test match, returning to Australia to be present for the birth of his daughter.\nVenues.\nThe four matches were played at the following venues in England.\nFixtures.\nNew Zealand played four matches on tour, including three test matches against England. England also played a test match against France on 24 October.\nGame 1.\nGerard Beale was originally named to play but was replaced by Lewis Brown.\nTest 1.\nAlex Glenn and Lewis Brown were named as 18th and 19th man respectively for the Kiwis.\nTest 2.\nStephen Kearney originally named Tuimoala Lolohea at halfback before selecting Kodi Nikorima to start the match.\nTest 3.\nWith the win, England retained the Baskerville Shield. Isaac Liu and Gerard Beale were 18th and 19th man respectively for New Zealand.\nAftermath.\nEngland's captain, Sean O'Loughlin was awarded the George Smith Medal as player of the series. This was England's first major series win in 8 years with their last win coming in the previous Kiwis tour of Great Britain."

He signed with the Orioles and made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Orioles, where he spent most of 2013, slashing .228/.312/.301 in 33 games, before finishing the season with the Aberdeen IronBirds, playing three games for them. In February 2014, Orioles manager Buck Showalter asked Hart to write a one-page report on Frank Robinson, after Hart admitted that he did not know about Robinson. Hart played 2014 with the Delmarva Shorebirds, batting .255 with one home run and 28 RBIs in 85 games. He missed time during the season due to a torn meniscus. In 2015, he played for the Frederick Keys where he posted a .255 batting average with one home run, 28 RBIs, and 30 stolen bases in 104 games, and in 2016, he returned to Frederick where he batted .223 with four home runs and 31 RBIs in 97 games. Hart played in only 38 games in 2017 due to an ankle injury. In 38 total games between Aberdeen, Frederick and the Gulf Coast Orioles, he slashed a combined .270/.336/.421. He was released on March 29, 2018. "

Qualification ended on 3 July 2016.\nQualifying standards.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) may enter a maximum of 2 qualified athletes in each individual event, only if both athletes have attained the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT). One athlete per event can potentially enter if they meet the Olympic Selection Time (OST) or if the quota of 900 athletes has not been targeted. NOCs may also permit swimmers regardless of time (1 per gender) under a Universality place, as long as they have no swimmers reaching either the standard entry time.\nIn the relay events, a maximum of 16 qualifying teams in each relay event must be permitted to accumulate a total of 96 relay teams; each NOC may enter only one team. The first twelve teams in each relay event at the 2015 World Championships will automatically compete for the relay events at the Olympics; while the remaining four per relay event must obtain their fastest entry times based on the FINA World Rankings of 31 May 2016 during the process.\nFollowing the end of the qualification period, FINA will assess the number of athletes having achieved the OQT, the number of relay-only swimmers, and the number of Universality places, before inviting athletes with OST to fulfill the total quota of 900. Additionally, OST places will be distributed by event according to the position of the FINA World Rankings during the qualifying deadline (3 July 2016).\nThe qualifying time standards must be obtained in World Championships, Continental Championships, Continental Qualification Events, National Championships and Trials, or International Competitions approved by FINA in the period between 1 March 2015 to 3 July 2016.\nFINA qualifying standards are as follows:\nIndividual events.\nThose who have achieved the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT) or the Olympic Selection Time (OST), or have been guaranteed a Universality place are listed below for each of the following individual events:"

He threw down a gold-medal time of 21.40 to touch out the defending titleholder Florent Manaudou of France by a hundredth of a second. Manaudou was quick off the blocks, but could not catch Ervin near the wall to finish with a silver in 21.41. Meanwhile, Ervin's teammate Nathan Adrian swam to another bronze-medal feat at the Games with a 21.49.\nSeparated the top three by almost two tenths of a second, Great Britain's Benjamin Proud finished off the podium with a fourth-place time in 21.68, while Ukraine's Andriy Govorov, who led a vast field of swimmers earlier in the heats, slipped shortly to fifth in 21.74.

Rallying from seventh at the halfway turn, he overhauled the field for the gold medal and a junior world record in 47.58. Swimming out of lane seven, Pieter Timmers posted a 47.80 to take home the silver for the Belgians, along with a national record. Meanwhile, U.S. sprinter and defending champion Nathan Adrian barely advanced out of the prelims earlier, but bounced back to earn a bronze in the final with a 47.85.\nLeading the race early on the initial length, Canada's Santo Condorelli narrowly slipped out of the podium to fourth in 47.88, just a 0.03-second deficit behind Adrian. British teenager Duncan Scott finished fifth in 48.01 to match his own national record that he set in the heats. American youngster Caeleb Dressel picked up a sixth spot in 48.02, while Australia's pre-race favorite Cameron McEvoy dropped back to seventh in 48.12.

There were 47 competitors from 36 nations.\nSummary.\nAfter a runner-up feat in the 400 m freestyle two days earlier, China's Sun Yang put up a monumental effort for the Olympic mid-distance freestyle title in a race against Chad le Clos of South Africa and Conor Dwyer of the United States. Hanging with the leaders at the 150-metre turn, Sun made a late charge on the final lap to edge out Le Clos in front and did not let Dwyer pass him for the gold medal in 1:44.65. Despite his early jump to the immediate lead before the final stretch, Le Clos could not hold off Sun to finish with a silver and an African record time in 1:45.20. Meanwhile, Dwyer powered home with a bronze in 1:45.23. Sun was the sixth man to win multiple medals in the event. Le Clos's silver was South Africa's first medal in the men's 200 metre freestyle.\nSwimming on the outside lane, 2015 World champion James Guy of Great Britain improved upon his position to finish fourth with a 1:45.49. Dwyer's teammate Townley Haas claimed the fifth spot in 1:45.58, while Germany's world record holder Paul Biedermann (1:45.84), Japan's Kosuke Hagino (1:45.90), the Olympic champion in the 400 m individual medley, and Russia's Aleksandr Krasnykh (1:45.91) rounded out the field.\nOther notable swimmers featured France's Yannick Agnel, who missed a chance to defend his Olympic title after fading to nineteenth in the prelims with a 1:47.35, and two-time silver medalist Park Tae-hwan of South Korea, who posted a twenty-ninth-place time of 1:48.06 in his fourth Olympic appearance. Shortly after the Games, Agnel, aged 24, officially confirmed his retirement from international swimming.\nThe medals for the competition were presented by Tsunekazu Takeda, Japan, member of the International Olympic Committee and the gifts were presented by Kazuo Sano, Bureau Member of FINA.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th appearance of the 200 metre freestyle event. It was first contested in 1900. It would be contested a second time, though at 220 yards, in 1904. After that, the event did not return until 1968; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games.\nFive of the 8 finalists from the 2012 Games returned: gold medalist Yannick Agnel of France, silver medalists Sun Yang of China and Park Tae-hwan of South Korea, fifth-place finisher Paul Biedermann of Germany, and seventh-place finisher Thomas Fraser-Holmes of Australia. Agnel had won the 2013 World Championship; James Guy of Great Britain had won in 2015. Sun was favoured, having had the strongest season so far in 2016.\nAntigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Jordan, Palestine, and Samoa each made their debut in the event. Australia made its 15th appearance, the only nation to have competed in all prior editions of the event.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to two swimmers if both met the Olympic Qualifying Time (or \"OQT\"). An NOC with no swimmers meeting the OQT but at least one swimmer meeting the Olympic Selection Time (or \"OST\") was not guaranteed a place, but was eligible for selection to fill the overall 900 swimmer quota for the Games. For 2016, the OQT was 1:47.97 while the OST was 1:51.75. The qualifying window was 1 March 2015 to 3 July 2016; only approved meets (generally international competitions and national Olympic trials) during that period could be used to meet the standards. There were also universality places available; if no male swimmer from a nation qualified in any event, the NOC could enter one male swimmer in an event.\nThe two swimmers per NOC limit had been in place since the 1984 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition followed the format established in 2000, with three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. The top 16 swimmers from the heats advanced to the semifinals. The top 8 semifinalists advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe heats began at 1:19pm."

He held off a stiff competition from Australia's reigning world champion Mitch Larkin down the home stretch to earn his second individual gold at the Games with a time of 1:53.62.

It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nThree of the 8 finalists from the 2012 Games returned: silver medalist Ryosuke Irie of Japan, fourth-place finisher Radosław Kawęcki of Poland, and eighth-place finisher Mitch Larkin of Australia. Larkin, Kawęcki, and Evgeny Rylov of Russia had reached the podium at the 2015 World Championships, with Irie 4th and American Ryan Murphy taking 5th. Larkin was the favourite, though Murphy had a strong showing at the U.S. Olympic trials and had already won the 100 metre backstroke in Rio (defeating Larkin, who finished fourth).\nAzerbaijan, Belarus, and the Virgin Islands each made their debut in the event.

He jumped to an immediate lead, and never looked back, charging ahead of the field with his trademark high stroke rate to lower his own world record at 57.13.

Coming from behind in lane eight, he produced a late surge about the midway of the final leg to upset the pool for an unexpected Olympic triumph with a 2:07.46. U.S. breaststroker Josh Prenot nearly charged to the front at the final stretch, before fading to a runner-up finish in 2:07.53, seven-hundredths of a second behind the Kazakh.

The Singapore National Olympic Council awarded Schooling S$1 million (about US$740,000) under the Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP). Singapore's unique \"rewards for sports excellence\" were the world's largest Olympic cash prize. Leading from the start, Schooling defeated the field of experienced sprinters, including all-time medal leader and his personal hero Phelps, to establish a new Olympic record of 50.39 for a gold-medal triumph. Schooling did not only erase Phelps' eight-year-old record by 0.19 seconds, but also produced the fastest time of the event in textile.\nThree-quarters of a second later, Phelps touched the wall at the same moment as two of his rivals Chad le Clos of South Africa and four-time Olympian László Cseh of Hungary, leaving them with a matching 51.14 in a historic three-way tie for the silver. Despite missing out an Olympic title defense, Phelps continued to extend his Olympic résumé with a twenty-seventh career medal.\nSeparated by the leader of the field by almost a second, Chinese swimmer and 2014 Youth Olympic champion Li Zhuhao picked up the fifth spot with a junior world record of 51.26. Meanwhile, France's Mehdy Metella (51.58), Phelps' teammate Tom Shields (51.73), and Russia's Aleksandr Sadovnikov (51.84) closed out the championship field.\nNotable swimmers failed to reach the top eight roster, featuring Schooling's countryman Quah Zheng Wen; London 2012 finalists Steffen Deibler (Germany), Joeri Verlinden (Netherlands), and Konrad Czerniak (Poland); Canada's Santo Condorelli, who produced a surprising top 16 finish from an unseeded prelims heat; and Papua New Guinea's Ryan Pini, who missed another chance to reproduce a top eight feat from Beijing 2008 in his fourth Olympic appearance.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were:\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nCompetition format.\nThe competition consisted of three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final.

Holding a tight race against the field on the lead-off leg by Caeleb Dressel (48.10), Michael Phelps threw down a 47.12 split on the second leg to move the Americans to the front, until he handed the youngster Ryan Held (47.73) and veteran Nathan Adrian their relay duties at the remaining exchanges of the race.

Meanwhile, Sandrine Mainville (53.86), Chantal Van Landeghem (53.12), Taylor Ruck (53.19), and Penny Oleksiak (52.72) ended Canada's 20-year medal drought for the female swimmers by taking home the bronze in 3:32.89.\nThe Dutch quartet of Marrit Steenbergen (54.29), Femke Heemskerk (53.47), Inge Dekker (53.85), and three-time gold medalist Ranomi Kromowidjojo (52.20) fell short of the medal podium with a fourth-place time in 3:33.81, while Sweden (3:35.90), Italy (3:36.78), France (3:37.45), and Japan (3:37.78) also vied for an Olympic medal.\nEarlier in the prelims, the Australian team of Elmslie (53.22), Campbell sisters Bronte (53.26) and Cate (51.80), and Madison Wilson (54.11) grabbed the top seed with a 3:32.39 to overturn their own existing Olympic record by 86-hundredths of a second.\nThe medals were presented by John Dowling Coates, Australia Vice President of the IOC and Dennis Miller, Vice President of FINA.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nCompetition format.\nThe competition consisted of two rounds: heats and a final.

Trading the lead with Sweden, China, and Australia through the first three legs of the race, Ledecky left the field behind with an anchor split of 1:53.74 to deliver the American foursome of Allison Schmitt (1:56.21), Leah Smith (1:56.69), and Maya DiRado (1:56.39) a gold medal in 7:43.03. As the Americans celebrated their victory, Ledecky also added the relay gold to her individual triumphs in both the 200 and 400 m freestyle earlier.\nAustralia's Leah Neale (1:57.95), Emma McKeon (1:54.64), and Bronte Barratt (1:55.81) moved themselves to the front on the third leg. As the youngster Tamsin Cook dove into the pool at the final exchange with a 1:56.47 split, she could not catch Ledecky near the wall to reproduce her nation's silver-medal feat from London 2012 in 7:44.87. Meanwhile, Canada's Katerine Savard (1:57.91), Taylor Ruck (1:56.18), Brittany MacLean (1:56.36), and Penny Oleksiak (1:54.94) were unable to close the gap on the two leading teams at the anchor leg, leaving them with a bronze and a national record in 7:45.39.\nSeizing a brief lead early in the race, the Chinese combination of Shen Duo (1:56.30), Ai Yanhan (1:57.79), Dong Jie (1:57.15), and Zhang Yuhan (1:56.72) slipped out of medals to fourth in 7:47.96.

        "title": "Surfing in the United States",
        "text": "Surfing in the United States is a popular hobby in coastal areas, and more recently due to the invention of wave pools, inland regions of the country. It contributes to a lifestyle and culture in which millions participate and which millions more have an interest. USA surfing is the governing body for the sport of surfing in the United States, with surf leagues such as the World Surf League available in the country. Surfing can be traced back to 17th Century Hawaii and has evolved over time into the professional sport it is today, with surfing being included for the first time in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\nHistory.\nSurfing was first documented by Captain James Cook in 1767 during his expeditions across the Pacific Ocean in Tahiti and Hawaii, however research suggests that surfing dates back to ancient Polynesian cultures up to a thousand years ago. Throughout the Pacific, wave-riding existed in various forms, however only in Hawaii did it embed itself within the social, political and religious fabric of society. At the time of the European's arrival surfing was deeply embedded in Hawaiian society. Hawaiian petroglyphs dated to AD 1000 depict surfing and surfboard making. The boards in Hawaii were longer and heavier than other Polynesian colonies, and only there were references to sitting, kneeling and standing on specialised surfboards recorded dating back to AD 500. By 1778 ancient Hawaiians were using three types of timber to make surfboards – Acacia koa, Artocarpus altilis, and Erythrina sandwicensis. Hawaiian balsa was the post popular material to craft surfboards with due to its light weight and superior buoyancy. Surfing in ancient Hawaii transcended class divisions, with men, women and children all riding waves for pleasure. Most Hawaiian families owned a surfboard, and were decorated and named. For ancient Hawaiians surfing was seen as a social, communal and even sexual activity.\nSurfing was brought to the United States in July 1885 when three teenage Hawaiian princes, David Kawananakoa, Edward Keliʻiahonui and Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana'ole, surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River in Santa Cruz on custom-shaped redwood boards. In 1907 George Freeth demonstrated surfing as a publicity stunt at the Huntington beach pier to promote the opening of the Los Angeles-Redondo-Huntington railroad.\nSurfing on the East Coast of the United States was pioneered in 1909 by Burke Haywood Bridgers in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. After finding little success with lightweight, juniper boards, Bridgers wrote to Alexander Hume Ford and the Hawaiian newspapers for advice about board shapes and design, and surfing styles. Bridgers continued to craft his own surfboards and promote surfing in North Carolina. Duke Kahanamoku, the father of modern surfing, introduced the sport to New Yorkers in 1912 while en route from Honolulu to the Stockholm Olympic Games at Rockaway Beach.\nIn the early 1900s, surfing began to be recognised by international sporting agencies as a legitimate sport. Alexander Hume Ford created the Hands-Around-the-Pacific Club in 1911, which was later renamed the Pan Pacific Union in 1917. The organisation focused on the outgrowth of Pacific-area tourism promotion activities, and sponsored the Mid-Pacific Carnival in 1913 at Waikiki, Honolulu. The Duke Kahanamoku made his first visit to Huntington Beach in the early 1920s, following his Olympic gold medal win at the 1912 Olympics. He is credited with popularising surfing in Southern California from 1913 to 1929. By mid-to late 1930s tens of thousands of Americans were travelling to Hawaii every year and experiencing surfing.\nSurfing's popularity began to increase in the United States post-WWII and peaked in the 1960s. Now called the U.S. Open of Surfing, the West Coast Surfing Championship was the first surfing tournament in the United States and was held in 1959 at Huntington Beach, California.\nThe International Professional Surfers (IPS) was founded by Hawaiian surfers Fred Hemmings and Randy Rarick in 1976. The Association of Surfing Professionals was founded in 1983 before officially becoming the World Surf League (WSL) in 2015. 11 U.S. men and women now compete in the WSL.\nIn 2016, The International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted unanimously for the inclusion of surfing in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\nSurfing culture in the United States.\nSurfing's popularity began to grow post-World War II. With the expansion of the middle class in the 1950s, the number of American consumers who sought leisure at the beach grew dramatically. As surfing became more popular, especially amongst young people, it became more than a recreational hobby and affected music, fashion, literature, film and art and jargon. For many beachgoers, especially after the release of Hollywood surf film “Gidget” in 1959, surfing became a subcultural pastime. Some other aspects of surf culture in the 1960s include the Woodie, bikinis, boardshorts and surf music such as ‘The Beach Boys’’ “Surfin’ Safari” released in 1962. John Severson founded “The Surfer”, the world's first surfing magazine, in 1959.\nSome popular U.S. surf ware and apparel brands include “O’Neill” founded by Jack O’Neill in California in 1952, “Vans” founded in 1966, “Channel Islands Surfboards” founded in 1969, and “Dakine” founded in 1979.\nTerritorialism has arisen in surf breaks with large amounts of surfers located close to a large population centre. Territorialism involves regular surfers becoming confrontational and territorial about their local surf breaks, especially at surf breaks that attract many seasonal vacationers. This has led to the creation of loose surf gangs who protect their surf break from tourists. Some prominent Southern Californian gangs include Malibu Locals Only and Lunada Bay Boys, with the main surf gang in Hawaii known as the ‘da huis’. These gangs have been known to use verbal and physical confrontation to deter tourists from their surf breaks. Territorialism often occurs due to socioeconomic factors. Many surfers originally came from a lower economic class and resented well-off vacationers who visited their towns to surf recreationally.\nSurfing is growing amongst the African American community, despite being seen as a \"white sport\".\nDemographics.\nThere are over 3.5 million surfers in the US, with youth accounting for approximately 32% of that demographic. The average surfer in the United States is 34 years old and will drive approximately 10 miles to surf, spending approximately $40 per session. The United States has the largest share of the surfing industry, accounting for 49% of total sales on average each year. The average surfer in the United States earns $75,000. Locations with exceptional waves bring in large levels of activity form surfers, with Trestles surf break in San Diego, CA having an estimated economic value of $24 million. The average surfer in the United States is 34 years old and owns 4 different surfboards. Surfing contributes greatly to the U.S. economy with US- based surfers spending over $3 billion each year on their domestic surfing trips. The average surfer in the US will surf 108 times each year on average. Over 6 million people in the United States watch professional surfing on TV each year. There are 9 official surf schools in the United States. The Surf Industry Manufacturers Association (SIMA), reported that the United States Surf industry had grown from US$6.52 billion in 2004 to US$7.48 billion in 2006.\nBig wave surfing.\nBig wave surfing involves riding a wave that is at least 6.2 meters (20 ft) high, on surfboards known as “guns” or “towboards” that are typically 1.82 to 3.65 meters (6 to 12 ft long). These boards are thicker than regular surfboards enabling a rider to paddle fast enough to catch a wave. The boards have a round-pin tail allowing surfers to dig into large waves in order to carry out high-speed turns.\nBig wave surfing in the United States dates back to the 1940s and 1950s, when surfers Woody Brown and Dickie Cross surfed a large swell at Sunset Beach in 1943. Dickie Cross did not survive. Greg Noll is widely renowned as being surfing's first big wave surfers, migrating to Hawaii in 1953 where he regularly surfed at Makaha, the largest wave surfed at the time. Greg Noll became one of the first people to surf Waimea bay in 1957. Greg Noll was credited with surfing the largest wave to date on December 4, 1969, at Makaha, estimated to be 9.14 meters (30 ft) high. Hawaiian Eddie Aikau transformed the boundaries of big wave surfing in the 1970s, winning the 1977 Duke Kahanamoku Invitational Surfing Championship. A memorial big wave contest in his name was held 1984 and has continued yearly until 2020. Jeff Clark was credited with surfing Mavericks for the first time in 1975, surfing the break alone for 15 years. He introduced the break to other surfers from Santa Cruz in 1992 and the break was on the cover of Surfer Magazine by 1992. In 1992 surfers Buzzy Kerbox and Laird Hamilton became pioneers in using a personal watercraft (\"jet ski\") to pull other surfers into waves that were too big and fast moving to paddle into. The invention of tow-in surfing transformed big wave surfing, allowing surfers to ride waves bigger than ever previously ridden. The new discipline revolutionised big wave board size, allowing big wave surfers to use 2.13 meters (7 ft) boards that were easier to manoeuvre.\nIn 2005, the World Surf League introduced the Big Wave Awards across seven categories including:\nIn 2009, surfboard shaper Gary Linden launched the Big Wave World Tour, which was taken over by the Association of Surfing Professionals in 2014.\nU.S. Big Wave World Tour Title Holders:\nNotable US Big Wave Surfing Spots:\nBig wave surfers conduct immense amounts of preparation in order to stay safe and perform at their best when riding large waves. Underwater rock running assists surfer to better their lung capacity and prepare for being held underwater for long periods of time. Some of the world's best big wave surfers can hold their breath for up to 5 minutes. Yoga assists big wave surfers to stay flexible, and to use air more efficiently.\nU.S. World Title holders.\nMen\nWomen"

Seven national teams were sent, with 10 cyclists each from France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Luxembourg/Mixed (the latter a combined team of seven Luxembourgian cyclists plus one Portuguese, one British and one Italian cyclist). France additionally sent five regional teams from 10 cyclists each, divided into Center-North East France, South East France, West France, Ile de France and South West France. In total, 120 cyclists started the race.\nThe winner of the three previous editions, Louison Bobet, was absent because he had surgery. There were less climbs than usual and no mountain top finishes, so cycling experts expected this edition to be too easy. No other former Tour de France winner started the race. This was the third time in history that the race started without former winners, after the initial 1903 Tour de France and the 1927 Tour de France. As Bobet was not there, the race was open, and so there were many riders thought able to win the Tour. The most favourite of these was probably Charly Gaul, who had won the 1956 Giro d'Italia, although he was in a weak team, and would also be aiming for the mountains classification."

Gaul had requested to ride in the Dutch team, but this was not allowed. Louison Bobet and Raphael Géminiani, two important French cyclists, did not race in 1957, so the French team needed new stars. The team was then built around young Jacques Anquetil, who had broken the hour record earlier that year.\nThe riders who had been favourites in previous years had stopped racing (Fausto Coppi), had lost their greatness (Hugo Koblet), or had chosen not to participate (Louison Bobet). As a result, there was no outspoken favourite.\nRoger Walkowiak, who had won the previous edition, had not shown good results since. Gaul had lost the 1957 Giro d'Italia when he was almost sure of winning it, so he was not considered to be in great form. Gastone Nencini, who won the 1957 Giro, was not considered constant enough. The Spanish team was considered the best Spanish team ever, but they were more a favourite for the mountain classification than for the general classification. The Belgian team was focussed around Jan Adriaensens."

There were also three regional French teams: Centre-Midi, West/South West and Paris/North East.\nThe French team had had some problems with the selection, as Jacques Anquetil, the winner of the 1957 Tour de France, did not want to share leadership with Louison Bobet, winner in 1953, 1954 and 1955. Anquetil had been so superior in 1957, that he did not want Bobet and Géminiani both in his team. The French team selector then chose to include Bobet in the national team.\nRaphael Géminiani, who had been in the French national team since 1949, was demoted into the regional Centre-Midi team. Géminiani was not pleased, and sent the French team director Marcel Bidot a jack-ass named \"Marcel\" to express his displeasure.\nCharly Gaul, part of the Dutch/Luxembourgian team, anticipated so little help from his teammates that he announced that he would not share prizes.

This also posed a problem, as they all wanted to be team captains, and refused to work for each other.\nThe Spanish team was headed by Federico Bahamontes, who in previous years did not care for flat stages and time trials, and only tried to win the mountains classification. In the 1959 season, Bahamontes had Fausto Coppi as manager, and Coppi convinced Bahamontes to focus on the general classification. The defending champion Charly Gaul was again placed in a mixed team of Luxembourgian and Dutch cyclists, and expected little support. The Italian team did not include Vito Favero and Gastone Nencini, who had performed well in the 1958 Tour. Their team captain was Ercole Baldini, winner of the 1958 Giro d'Italia, but he was not expected to be able to compete against Gaul, Bahamontes and Anquetil.\nOf the cyclists in the French regional teams, Henri Anglade was the most notable. He was included in the Centre-Midi team,\nThe cyclists were represented by agents, who negotiated for the prices in post-tour criteriums. There were two major agents: Daniel Dousset, who represented Anquetil, Rivière and Bahamontes, and Piel Poulidor, who represented Anglade. This made it more important for Anquetil to help Bahamontes than Anglade."

In 1905, sponsors had not been so enthusiastic about entering their cyclists in this category, but in 1906 they had learned that it had a commercial advantage to have cyclists starting in the poinçonnées category, because the average French citizen could identify more with them.

Name 'Górnik' stands for 'Miners' as the city of Walbrzych was known for its thriving mining industry until the early 90s.\nHistory.\nGórnik was founded in 1946. The most famous departments - basketball and football, were opened in the same year. The basketball team in 1956 won promotion to the Division I, and in 1970 it appeared for the first time in the Polish top flight. Best years for Górnik's basketball team were the 1980s. In 1981, Górnik was Polish league runner-up, in 1982 it won its first championship. In 1983 and 1986, the club was a runner-up again. Górnik won its second Polish league title in 1988. Then, in the 1990s, coal-mining industry in the city of Wałbrzych collapsed and, lacking sponsorship, Górnik started to decline. In 1995, the White and Blues left the top division due to poor financing, despite finishing 4th. Good times returned in the 2006–2007 season, when Górnik, with a new sponsor and under the name \"Victoria-Górnik\", won promotion to the elite Dominet Basket Liga. However, it faced relegation to Division I in 2008–2009 season.\nFrom 2009 through 2011 Górnik played in the Division I but missed playoffs both seasons. Due to financial deterioration, the club restructured and started over from the bottom, Division III (fourth-tier league). Górnik spent three seasons in Division III and won promotion in 2014. From 2014 through 2017 Górnik was contending in Division II and planned to return to Division I. In 2017–18 season, the White and Blues, playing a 7th man rotation, unexpectedly reached the finals and finished second in Division II. Next year, the team advanced to Division I playoffs as 8th seed but lost in the first round (1-3) to no. 1 seed Śląsk Wrocław.\nSeason 2019-20 was suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Poland. At that time, few games shy to close the regular season, Górnik was leading the Division I standings with 18–5 record. Later on, it was officially named the 2020 Division I Champion.

        "title": "Twickenham Cricket Club",
        "text": "Twickenham Cricket Club is an historic amateur cricket club in Twickenham in the United Kingdom. Twickenham played their first ever game in 1833 when they locked horns with Thames Ditton Cricket Club. A copy of the scorecard from that game hangs in the club's home, the pavilion on Twickenham Green.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest record of cricket being played in Twickenham dates back to 1735. It is contained in a letter by Lady Suffolk to her husband, suggesting she had learned of the game at Marble Hill House and might practice that afternoon.\nThe first recorded match played by Twickenham Cricket Club was on 29 July 1833 against Thames Ditton. The two clubs met again for a centenary match in 1933. The match stands unique as the only joint centenary match played by the original teams.\nSome early cricket matches were played \"For the Honour of the Game\" whilst others were played for \"A New Ball\". Other quirks of the early games include batsmen being \"Thrown out\" rather than \"Run Out\" and \"Hit Foot\" rather than \"LBW\" or \"Leg Before Wicket\". What is currently termed as a victory \"By and Innings\" was then referred to as \"Single Handed\".\nThe old score cards show comparatively low scores, with 73 being the highest individual batsman's score for the twenty-year period.\nTeams.\n1st XI.\nSince 2007, Twickenham's premier side has competed in the Middlesex County Cricket League (MCCL), winning promotion from Division 3 in their inaugural season under the captaincy of Jon Varney. Promotion from Division 2 to the MCCL Premier Division followed in 2009 thanks in part to a successful season by ex TCC junior, James Munting. He took 5 wickets on 6 occasions, a standing club record. New captain, powerful top order batsman Carlos Nunes was also very influential. In a dramatic final game of the 2009 season the Twickenham tail were guided from a seemingly impossible position by the experienced John-Pierre Cronje, to achieve the necessary draw against promotion rivals, Southgate CC, to pip them to promotion. The dramatic achievement was immortalised by the opposition's light hearted, comical depiction of how Adolf Hitler may have interpreted the result, on YouTube.\nTwickenham found Premier league cricket challenging, lasting just 2 seasons before they were relegated in 2011. The acquisition of Indian Left Arm spinner Parminder Singh in 2012 proved decisive as well as bringing on internal talent as he returned Twickenham CC best bowling figures of 8-18 early on in a season which saw him finish with a bowling average of just 10 runs per wicket taken. Promotion was secured with just 1 defeat all season and 12 victories (2 draws and 3 abandonments due to inclement weather). Singh continued leading the Twickenham attack and the records continued to be broken. In the 2013 season Twickenham finished mid table in the Premiership, thanks in no small part to Singh's record breaking June when he took 18 wickets, the most by any Twickenham bowler in one month. In 2014 Singh took a club record 52 wickets in a season which saw Twickenham finish runners up only to Teddington in the club's highest ever league position.\nThe Ts have remained in the Premier League since then and in 2023 managed to win their first ever senior Middlesex-wide trophy; the Middlesex T20. They beat Indian Gymkhana and Teddington on the way to a finals' day at Ealing CC on 16 July 2023. Neville Talbot, Pat Dixon, Mayank Malhotra and Gus McKenzie were at the centre of Twickenham's narrow victory against Ealing in the semi-final. The final against Harrow St Mary's was a rather more straightforward affair, Twickenham getting home with 10 balls and six wickets to spare. Adam Mather (2–19) and Malhotra again (2–17) were at the centre of the Ts' bowling efforts, with Dixon (30), Malhotra (29) and Preet Patel (22no) leading the way with the bat.\nOther competitive teams.\nIn 2008 Twickenham increased their number of Saturday sides from the long-standing four teams to five. All five now play in the Middlesex County Cricket League. Success of the higher rated teams in the club saw demand for places exceed supply in 2014 and in order to accommodate paid up members, a 6th XI was formed playing friendly matches.\nSunday cricket.\nTwickenham have traditionally played Sunday friendly cricket. In 2012 Middlesex launched an U21 Development League where eight of the eleven players must be under 21 years of age. In order to encourage participation from the younger generation, Development Cricket is played in coloured kit (Pyjama Cricket) and with a pink ball – similar to televised one day cricket. Twickenham CC won the inaugural season of the competition.\nWomen's cricket.\nTwickenham also runs a successful women's team which competes in various forms of the game within Middlesex and indeed Surrey. Twickenham's women's side generally play games on Sundays and Wednesday evenings and home games are played on The Green.\nJanet Bitmead was the key driver of the TCC women's section for many years, and in 2023 she was made a vice-president of the club. Sarai Knight has been captain since 2020.\nJunior cricket.\nIn addition to adult cricket, Twickenham run a number of teams for younger players. Training and introduction to the game of cricket is available from the age of 5 through the specially designed Allstars cricket. From the age of 9 to 17, players are able to progress to competitive cricket against other local sides in age groups of under 10, under 11, under 12, under 13, under 15 and under 17. The junior section is run by Liam Tebb and Eugene Berger training is available from ECB Qualified coaches.\nOther sides.\nTwickenham Vets (Veterans) were established in 2012 and is made up of players over the age of 40. Friendly games are played regularly throughout the season, against teams of varying standards, including but not exclusively against other vets teams. Fixtures are played on Sundays and captained by Paul Johnson.\nThrough the season, Twickenham compete in a number of midweek fixtures with home games played on The Green. Fixtures include competitive 20/20 games and other friendly fixtures. Twickenham's cricket week is traditionally run the first full week of August and includes a number of friendly games – including an annual game against Thames Ditton – to commemorate the original game in 1833.\nTwickenham Green.\nTwickenham Green (or The Green) is the primary home venue for Twickenham CC First XI and Second XI (with home games being played on alternate Saturdays). The Green is also the home venue for a number of fixtures on Sunday's including the Lady's XI as well as various midweek fixtures hosted by Twickenham CC. The Green has also hired by local businesses to play fixtures not involving Twickenham CC.\nTwickenham Green is a surviving fragment of Hounslow Heath and aside from hosting cricket matches, The Green is believed to have been the location of a Pest House in the 19th Century for those unfortunate enough to be quarantined through infectious diseases. In 1894 The Green was the location of a water pump and it has also been the home of a Salvation Army Band. Prior to becoming the home of Twickenham Cricket Club in the mid-1850s, The Green was occupied by allotments and land allocated to the poor, there remains a listed Cattle Trough in the North East corner of The Green. The current owners of the land are London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and managed by the Parks and Open Spaces Service. The land is registered as Common Land.,\nThe Green is overlooked by The Holy Trinity Church of England Church to the South East and bordered by a number of shops to the North. The Southern corner is bordered by Archdeacon Cambridge's Church of England Primary School and the North East corner hosts a restaurant. There are in total 6 churches visible from The Green and when locals have spotted them all, time can be passed attempting to count as many visible London busses at any one time, due to the popular bus routes along Staines Road and Hampton Road combined with occasional heavy traffic.\nCricket is played at any time on the Western half of The Green with the remainder use for informal pursuits and picnicking by the public, particularly in good weather. On occasions The Green Hosts events including Circuses and Fairs. The Green has been bordered by Lime and Horse Chestnut Trees since 1872 which provide a home to birds, bats, invertebrates and fungi and is divided by a simple path running from Hampton Road to Staines Road.\nIn winter, the Green is the home venue for Thamesians Rugby Football Club and is also home to a cat called Zinzan who is rumoured to keep The Green free of vermin.\nThe pavilion.\nThe pavilion is a white, rectangular-shaped building housing changing facilities, washing facilities, storage facilities, a kitchen and a bar. The first floor is significantly smaller than the ground floor and is used for home team changing. The bulk of the ground floor is consumed by a bar and associated communal area where cricket teas are served and eaten. The building is serviced with terrestrial and satellite television as well as Wifi.\nThe pavilion is located in the southern corner of The Green on the apex of First Cross Road and Hampton Road. Parking for the Pavilion is available on these roads at a cost. The Pavilion is fronted by a raised veranda, is surrounded by paving and has a large clock facing the pitch in a traditional cricketing pavilion form.\nThe pavilion in its current state was opened by The Earl of Wessex on 19 April 2005 after the previous structure, referred to as \"Jack The Stripper\", was damaged by fire.\nThe total area of the pavilion covers fractionally over 100 square metres, including the storage space for ground maintenance equipment.\nNotable players.\nTwickenham CC's honours boards are displayed within the Pavilion and note members holding important positions including non-playing positions such as Secretaries and chairmen and playing positions such as Team Captains and Club Captains."

Fuzzy Woodruff once wrote, \"Schwartz is beyond any question or cavil the best defensive center in the South. He makes as many tackles on the ends as the ends or halfbacks. He is everywhere. He wears a moustache and it doesn't hurt him. Apparently he never gets tired.

        "title": "SummerSlam (2016)",
        "text": "The 2016 SummerSlam was the 29th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on August 21, 2016, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York for the second consecutive year. It was the first PPV event held after the brand extension, which was reintroduced in July, went into full effect.\nTwelve matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, which was an interbrand match, Raw's Brock Lesnar defeated SmackDown's Randy Orton by technical knockout. In another marquee match, \"The Demon King\" Finn Bálor defeated Seth Rollins to become the inaugural WWE Universal Champion, which was introduced to be Raw's world championship. In other prominent matches, Dean Ambrose defeating Dolph Ziggler to retain SmackDown's WWE World Championship, and AJ Styles defeated John Cena in a singles match.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual professional wrestling event produced every August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. Announced on September 28, 2015, the 2016 event was the 29th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 21, 2016, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York for the second consecutive year. In addition to airing on traditional PPV, the event was livestreamed on the WWE Network. Tickets went on sale on April 2 through Ticketmaster. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions, being the first pay-per-view to occur after the brand split went into full effect following its reintroduction the previous month. It was also the first pay-per-view to feature the WWE Universal Championship, following its establishment for Raw the previous month after the WWE World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to SmackDown and renamed to WWE World Championship.\nAhead of the event, the WWE and KFC, which is that year's event sponsor, held a promotional tie-in for its \"Chicken Little\" chicken sandwich. It featured a match between The Miz, dressed as \"Puppers Cluckers\" in a yellow chicken suit and Dolph Ziggler, as Colonel Sanders which took place after the conclusion of the August 16 episode of \"SmackDown Live\" where Ziggler emerged victorious.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised 12 matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"SmackDown Live\".\nOn June 5, WWE granted Brock Lesnar a \"one-off opportunity\" to return to mixed martial arts competition at \"UFC 200\" on July 9, while also confirming that Lesnar would compete at SummerSlam. On the July 7 episode of \"SmackDown\", Lesnar's SummerSlam opponent was announced as Randy Orton, who was returning from injury. WWE billed the match as \"15 years in the making\". On July 15, WWE confirmed that the match would still be taking place, despite a USADA notification in regards to Lesnar's UFC fight, stemming from an out-of-competition sample collected on June 28, which tested positive for a banned substance. A second sample taken in-competition on July 9 was also tested positive for the same banned substance, believed to be hydroxy-clomifene, discovered in the previous sample. On July 26, WWE confirmed that Lesnar would not be facing any disciplinary action from the WWE as he is exempt from the WWE Wellness Policy due to his status as a part-time performer. Orton returned at Battleground as the guest on Chris Jericho's \"Highlight Reel\". Orton said that he only needed one \"RKO\" to take down Lesnar and also took a shot at Lesnar's failed drug tests. On the August 1 episode of \"Raw\", Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman proclaimed that Orton would never be able to execute his finisher on Lesnar when Orton suddenly appeared and attacked Lesnar with an \"RKO\". Lesnar subsequently attacked Orton with an \"F-5\" during his match against Fandango on \"SmackDown\" the next night. The last \"Raw\" before SummerSlam saw Lesnar and Heyman cutting another promo on Orton until Heath Slater interrupted, aiming to earn a WWE contract (as he was undrafted in the WWE draft) by defeating Lesnar. Lesnar attacked Slater with an \"F-5\" to send a message to Orton. Slater faced Orton the next night on \"SmackDown\" to earn a contract. Orton intentionally got himself disqualified, mocking Lesnar before attacking Slater with an \"RKO\".\nAfter SmackDown draftee Dean Ambrose retained the WWE World Championship at Battleground against Raw draftees Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins in a triple threat match, \"Raw\" was left without a world title. Subsequently, Stephanie McMahon and Mick Foley announced a new championship, the WWE Universal Championship, the following night on \"Raw\" to serve as the brand's top championship. It was then announced that the inaugural champion would be crowned at SummerSlam in a singles match; Rollins, as \"Raw\"'s #1 draft pick, was automatically set for that match, while his opponent was determined by two fatal four-way matches that night, with the winners wrestling each other in a singles match. Finn Bálor won the first qualifier by defeating Cesaro, Kevin Owens, and Rusev, while Reigns won the second by defeating Chris Jericho, Sami Zayn, and Sheamus. Bálor then defeated Reigns and was added to the title match at SummerSlam. Bálor and Rollins confronted each other the following week, both promising to win at SummerSlam. Rollins then attempted to attack Bálor, but Bálor countered, forcing Rollins to retreat. Two weeks later, Bálor's alter ego, \"The Demon King\", confronted Rollins after Rollins called him out.\nOn the July 26 episode of \"SmackDown\", a six-pack challenge involving John Cena, Bray Wyatt, AJ Styles, Dolph Ziggler, Baron Corbin, and Apollo Crews was held to determine the #1 contender for the WWE World Championship at SummerSlam. Ziggler won the match by pinning Styles. The next week, after Dean Ambrose doubted Ziggler's ability, Wyatt attacked Ziggler and challenged him for his title shot. Ziggler accepted and defeated Wyatt. The next week, after Ambrose and Ziggler teamed up to defeat Wyatt and Erick Rowan, Ambrose performed \"Dirty Deeds\" on Ziggler. Ziggler responded by attacking Ambrose with a superkick on their \"Miz TV\" segment during the final episode of \"SmackDown\" before SummerSlam.\nAt Battleground, Sasha Banks recruited Bayley from NXT as a mystery partner to defeat WWE Women's Champion Charlotte and Dana Brooke in a tag team match when Sasha made Charlotte submit. This earned Sasha a title match against Charlotte the following night on \"Raw\", in which she again made Charlotte submit to win the title. Charlotte invoked her rematch clause five days later to face Sasha for the title at SummerSlam. The following week, a confrontation between the two was interrupted by Chris Jericho and Enzo Amore, resulting in a mixed tag team match, which Charlotte and Jericho won. On the August 8 episode of \"Raw\", Sasha Banks defeated Brooke, resulting in Dana being banned from ringside at SummerSlam.\nAfter the aforementioned mixed tag team match, Chris Jericho attacked Enzo Amore until Big Cass came out to help his partner. Later in the event, Owens told Jericho that he had his back during a backstage interview with Tom Phillips. The following week, Jericho defeated Amore by disqualification when Cass interfered. After the match, Cass challenged Owens and Jericho to a tag team match at SummerSlam, which Owens and Jericho accepted.\nAfter AJ Styles's victory over John Cena at Money in the Bank, the club (Styles, Karl Anderson, and Luke Gallows) began attacking Cena until Enzo Amore and Big Cass came to Cena's aide, setting up a six-man tag team match for Battleground. At the event, Cena, Amore, and Cass defeated The club. During the draft Amore, Cass, Anderson, and Gallows were drafted to \"Raw\", while Cena and Styles were drafted to \"SmackDown\", splitting up the two teams. On the August 2 episode of \"SmackDown\", Styles challenged Cena to another match at SummerSlam, which Cena accepted.\nOn the August 2 episode of \"SmackDown\", Apollo Crews defeated Baron Corbin and Kalisto in a triple threat match to earn an Intercontinental Championship match against The Miz at SummerSlam.\nOn the July 25 episode of \"Raw\", The New Day (Kofi Kingston, Big E, and Xavier Woods) were celebrating in the ring on becoming the longest reigning WWE Tag Team Champions. While celebrating with a fan, Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson attacked all three members of New Day. The following week on \"Raw\", Big E and Kingston defeated Gallows and Anderson. Gallows and Anderson then attacked all three members of New Day, finishing with Gallows and Anderson pulling Big E groin-first into the ring post, causing a contusion in Big E's groin. On August 8, Woods and Kingston were scheduled to defend the WWE Tag Team Championship against Gallows and Anderson at SummerSlam.\nAfter losing to Cesaro on the August 1 episode of \"Raw\", Sheamus attacked Cesaro. On the August 8 episode of \"Raw\", Cesaro defeated Sheamus again, but lost a match for the United States Championship against Rusev after interference from Sheamus. On the August 15 episode of \"Raw\", Cesaro distracted Sheamus, costing him a match against Sami Zayn. During an ensuing argument, Raw General Manager Mick Foley scheduled a Best-of-Seven Series between the two, with the first match taking place at SummerSlam. On August 19, the match was moved to the SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show.\nEva Marie was drafted to \"SmackDown\", but for several episodes, circumstances, including a pulled hamstring and a wardrobe malfunction, prevented her from making her in-ring debut. On the August 16 episode, Eva Marie no-showed for her match against Naomi. Later that night, Becky Lynch and Carmella took on Natalya and Alexa Bliss; during the match, Marie appeared on the entrance ramp. Naomi then appeared and started to chase Marie, passing the ring at one point. During the confusion, Lynch applied her \"Dis-Arm-Her\" on Natalya, who submitted. Later on, a six-woman tag team match was scheduled for SummerSlam. On August 18, Marie was suspended for 30 days due to a violation of WWE's wellness policy, taking her out of the match. In light of this, WWE's advertising was intentionally vague about whether the match would be turned into a three-on-two handicap or if Natalya and Alexa would have a third partner.\nOn the August 16 episode of \"SmackDown\", American Alpha (Chad Gable and Jason Jordan), The Hype Bros (Zack Ryder and Mojo Rawley), and The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated Breezango (Tyler Breeze and Fandango), The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor), and The Vaudevillains (Aiden English and Simon Gotch). On August 19, a rematch was scheduled for the SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show. On the same show, Jon Stewart, who had been SummerSlam's guest host the previous year, was announced to be returning to the event as a special guest.\nCancelled match.\nOn the August 1 episode of \"Raw\", after United States Champion Rusev defeated Mark Henry to retain the title, Roman Reigns confronted Rusev. The following week, Reigns interrupted Rusev and Lana's wedding celebration and issued a challenge to Rusev for the title. Rusev declined and the two brawled, causing Lana to fall into a wedding cake. Backstage, Mick Foley told an angered Lana and Rusev that Rusev would be defending his United States title against Reigns at SummerSlam. Later that night, Rusev successfully defended his title in an impromptu match against Cesaro. After the match, Rusev was attacked by Reigns with a Spear. Reigns defeated Rusev in a non-title match the following week.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThree matches were contested on the SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show. In the first match, American Alpha (Jason Jordan and Chad Gable), The Hype Bros (Zack Ryder and Mojo Rawley), and The Usos (Jey and Jimmy Uso) faced Breezango (Tyler Breeze and Fandango), The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor), and The Vaudevillains (Aiden English and Simon Gotch) in a twelve-man tag team match. Jey Uso won the match for his team by pinning Simon Gotch after a Samoan Splash.\nAfter that, Sami Zayn and Neville squared off against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in a tag team match. In the end, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick on Bubba Ray followed by Neville executing the \"Red Arrow\" for the pinfall.\nFinally, Sheamus wrestled Cesaro in the first match of the best-of-seven series. Sheamus won the match with a \"Brogue Kick\" on Cesaro for the pinfall.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Enzo Amore and Big Cass facing Chris Jericho and Kevin Owens. In the climax, Amore executed a diving DDT on Jericho only for Owens to break up the pinfall. Owens and Jericho then performed a Pop-Up \"Codebreaker\" on Amore, with Jericho pinning Amore for the win.\nIn the second match, Sasha Banks defended the WWE Women's Championship against Charlotte with Dana Brooke banned from ringside. Early in the match, both combatants tried to apply their respective holds on each other but their efforts were not successful. However, Charlotte caught Banks on the top turnbuckle and dropped her, causing Banks to land awkwardly, injuring her back in the process. At one point during the match, Banks managed to counter a Razor's Edge powerbomb into a hurricanrana. Banks performed her Double Knees move on Charlotte's back for a nearfall. Banks blocked a Superplex attempt and followed up with a Meteora outside the ring. Back inside, Banks attempted a Backstabber, but failed because of her injured back. Charlotte attempted a \"Natural Selection\", only for Banks to counter into the \"Bank Statement\". Charlotte managed to escape and eventually executed the \"Natural Selection\" on Banks for a near-fall. In the end, Banks applied the \"Bank Statement\", however, Charlotte shifted her weight to score a pinfall victory and regain the championship.\nNext, The Miz defended the Intercontinental Championship against Apollo Crews. The match ended when The Miz avoided a \"Stinger Splash\" by Crews, allowing Miz to execute the \"Skull Crushing Finale\" to retain the title.\nIn the fourth match, AJ Styles faced John Cena. Early in the match, Styles countered an \"Attitude Adjustment\" into a Pele Kick and executed a \"Styles Clash\" for a near-fall, followed by Cena executing an \"Attitude Adjustment\" on Styles for a near-fall. Styles attempted a Springboard on Cena, which Cena countered into the STF. A trade of reversals from Styles's Calf Crusher and Cena's STF followed. Styles executed a \"Phenomenal Forearm\" on Cena for a two count. Cena performed a \"Super Attitude Adjustment\" on Styles for a nearfall. A shocked Cena tried another \"Attitude Adjustment\", but Styles countered it into a \"Styles Clash\". After a second \"Phenomenal Forearm\", Styles pinned Cena to win the match. After the match, Cena removed his armband and put it in the center of the ring before departing backstage to a standing ovation from the crowd.\nAfter that, Jon Stewart, acting as a replacement for the injured Big E, introduced the WWE Tag Team Champions, The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) for their title defense against Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. Gallows and Anderson executed the \"Magic Killer\" on Kingston, but Stewart entered the ring and distracted them. Gallows and Anderson then tried to injure Stewart's groin using the ring post when Big E ran in, making his return, and attacked Gallows and Anderson, thus causing a disqualification. Gallows and Anderson won the match, but The New Day retained the tag team championships.\nIn the sixth match, Dean Ambrose defended the WWE World Championship against Dolph Ziggler. In the end, Ambrose executed \"Dirty Deeds\" on Ziggler to retain the title.\nAfter that, Becky Lynch, Naomi, and Carmella were scheduled to face Natalya, Alexa Bliss, and Eva Marie in a six-woman tag team match. After Eva Marie was declared absent, Nikki Bella was introduced as her replacement. The match ended when Nikki performed a Forearm Smash on Carmella, who had been distracted by Natalya and Bliss, and executed a Fireman's Carry Cutter to win the match for her team.\nStephanie McMahon and Mick Foley then unveiled the new WWE Universal Championship belt in the ring. The inaugural champion was then determined in a match between \"The Demon King\" Finn Bálor and Seth Rollins, in a match that could only end in pinfall or submission. Early in the match, Rollins powerbombed Bálor into the barricade, causing Bálor to legitimately dislocate his shoulder. Later, Bálor attempted a Coup de Grâce, but Rollins moved out of the way and performed a Pedigree for a nearfall. Bálor then avoided a Phoenix Splash attempt and dropkicked Rollins into the corner turnbuckles. Bálor attempted a Coup de Grâce, but Rollins countered into a Superplex and attempted a Pedigree, only for Bálor to counter into a double stomp. Afterwards, Bálor dropkicked Rollins into the turnbuckles twice and followed up with the Coup de Grâce on Rollins to become the inaugural WWE Universal Champion.\nNext, Rusev was scheduled to defend the United States Championship against Roman Reigns. However, before the match officially started, Rusev attacked Reigns, resulting in a brawl. While the referees tried to separate the two, Reigns hit Rusev with a chair. Finally, Rusev was declared unable to compete. After the announcement was made, Reigns attacked Rusev with a spear.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Brock Lesnar fought Randy Orton. During the match, Lesnar threw Orton off the barricade through a broadcast table. Orton executed an \"RKO\" on the top of another broadcast table. Orton carried Lesnar back to the ring and performed an off-the-rope DDT. Orton then executed a second \"RKO\" for a near-fall. As Orton attempted a punt kick, Lesnar countered with an \"F-5\" for a near-fall. Lesnar removed his gloves and attacked Orton bare-knuckled, legitimately hitting him with numerous elbow strikes which caused Orton to bleed profusely. This led to Lesnar winning via technical knockout and Randy Orton tended to by WWE medical personnel. Afterwards, Shane McMahon came to the ring to check on Orton and was immediately given an F5 by Lesnar when confronted.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the event, Randy Orton received ten staples to close a laceration on his forehead. Reportedly, there was also a backstage confrontation between Brock Lesnar and Chris Jericho. According to Dave Meltzer of \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\", Jericho questioned WWE producer Michael Hayes about whether the finish was planned or not. After getting no response from Hayes, Jericho became angrier. Lesnar confronted Jericho and the two exchanged words and tangled up against a wall before Triple H and Vince McMahon broke up the situation, with McMahon stating that the ending was planned.\nRaw.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Finn Bálor vacated the Universal Championship due to a shoulder injury incurred at SummerSlam. On the same night, General Manager Mick Foley scheduled a fatal four-way elimination match for the next week's \"Raw\" to crown a new champion. Seth Rollins, Kevin Owens, Big Cass, and Roman Reigns each qualified for the match by defeating Sami Zayn, Neville, Rusev, and Chris Jericho, respectively. Owens subsequently won the WWE Universal Championship. Also on the post-SummerSlam \"Raw\", Sasha Banks was declared to be out of action due to an injury, reportedly up to two months. However, Charlotte's victory celebration was interrupted by Bayley, who was announced by Mick Foley as the Raw women's division's newest member. Furthermore, The Dudley Boyz announced their retirement, but were first confronted by The Shining Stars and then attacked by Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, who put D-Von through a table.\nAfter SmackDown unveiled their new titles on the post-SummerSlam \"SmackDown\", the WWE Women's Championship and WWE Tag Team Championship were subsequently renamed to Raw Women's Championship and Raw Tag Team Championship, respectively. Also, the finals of the Cruiserweight Classic occurred on September 14, 2016, and T. J. Perkins became the inaugural WWE Cruiserweight Champion for the Raw brand.\nSmackDown.\nOn the August 23 episode of \"SmackDown\", AJ Styles was declared the No. 1 contender for the WWE World Championship at Backlash. Styles also defeated Dolph Ziggler to prevent him from being inserted into the title match as well.\nWhen Randy Orton spoke about his match against Brock Lesnar and his future, he was interrupted by Bray Wyatt, and the two were scheduled for a match at Backlash. On August 29, 2016, WWE scheduled a rematch between Lesnar and Orton for a WWE house show on September 24 in Chicago, Illinois, where Lesnar defeated Orton.\nAlso on the following \"SmackDown\", the WWE SmackDown Women's Championship and WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship were unveiled for the brand. SmackDown's six active women were scheduled to compete in a six-pack elimination challenge for the title at Backlash, while a tag team tournament occurred over the next few weeks, culminating in a final match for the tag team titles at Backlash."

        "title": "2015 Vuelta a España",
        "text": "The 2015 Vuelta a España was a three-week Grand Tour cycling race. The race was the 70th edition of the Vuelta a España and took place principally in Spain, although two stages took place partly or wholly in Andorra, and was the 22nd race in the 2015 UCI World Tour. The race included 21 stages, beginning in Marbella on 22 August 2015 and finishing in Madrid on 13 September. It was won by Fabio Aru (Astana Pro Team), with Joaquim Rodríguez () second and Rafał Majka () third.\nThe early leaders of the race were Esteban Chaves () and Tom Dumoulin (), who exchanged the leader's red jersey several times during the first ten days of racing, with both riders winning summit finishes in the first week. Aru took over the race lead following the mountainous Stage 11, which took place entirely within Andorra. He kept his lead for five stages as the race entered the mountains of northern Spain, but lost it to Rodríguez on Stage 16. Dumoulin took the lead back on Stage 17 – the race's only individual time trial – with Aru three seconds behind in second place. Aru attacked throughout the final stages and, on the penultimate day, finally dropped Dumoulin, who fell to sixth place overall. Aru therefore took the first Grand Tour victory of his career.\nThe points classification was decided during the final stage and was won by Alejandro Valverde (), while Rodriguez won the combination classification. The mountains classification was won by Omar Fraile (). Dumoulin won the combativity award, while Movistar won the team prize.\nTeams.\nThe seventeen UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to attend the race. The organiser of the Vuelta, Unipublic, was also able to invite five UCI Professional Continental teams – the second tier of professional cycling teams – as wildcards. These were announced on 20 March 2015. , the only Spanish-registered Professional Continental team, was one of those invited, along with two French teams, and . were invited for the second consecutive year after also securing their first ever entry into the Tour de France. The final team to be invited was . One prominent team to miss out on an entry was .\nThe team presentation took place in Benahavís on the evening before the first stage. The number of riders allowed per squad was nine, therefore the start list contained a total of 198 riders. The riders represented 37 different countries, with the largest numbers coming from France (30), Spain (27) and Italy (20). The average age of riders in the Vuelta was 29.13 years, ranging from the 20-year-old Matej Mohorič () to the 38-year-old Haimar Zubeldia ().\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe top four riders from the 2015 Tour de France all chose to start the Vuelta. These were Chris Froome (), Nairo Quintana and Alejandro Valverde (both ) and Vincenzo Nibali (), all of whom had previously won Grand Tours. The most notable absentee from among the general classification contenders was Alberto Contador (), the winner of the 2014 Vuelta. Oleg Tinkov, the owner of the Tinkoff-Saxo team, had challenged Contador, Froome, Nibali and Quintana to attempt to ride all three Grand Tours in 2015; none of the riders took up the challenge. Froome, Nibali and Quintana all declined to ride the Giro and, as Contador was attempting to win both the Giro d'Italia and the Tour, he did not aim to ride the Vuelta. Valverde and Nibali were the only two previous winners of the race to start the 2015 edition.\nFroome, who had been second in the 2011 and 2014 Vueltas, had had a strong season, with victories in the , the Critérium du Dauphiné and the Tour de France. He was attempting to become the first rider since Bernard Hinault in 1978 to win both the Tour and the Vuelta in the same season, though it was expected that he would be tired following his victory in the Tour. The individual time trial was expected to favour Froome, who is strong in the discipline. Before the race, however, Froome was uncertain about his form and his ability to win the race. Quintana's only stage race victory of the season had come in the Tirreno–Adriatico, but he had performed strongly in the Alps in the Tour's final stages, and the mountainous route of the Vuelta was expected to suit him.\nVincenzo Nibali, who had won the Vuelta in 2010, had struggled in the opening stages of the Tour, but had recovered to take a stage victory in the final week. The Astana team also included Fabio Aru and Mikel Landa, second and third respectively at the Giro d'Italia; while this made a strong team, it was unclear which rider would be favoured by the team and given the assistance of his teammates. There was a similar situation at Movistar, as Valverde, who had won the Vuelta in 2009 and had finished on the podium on four other occasions, was also in strong form and was well suited to the course. Also among the general classification contenders were Joaquim Rodríguez (), Rafał Majka () and Tejay van Garderen ().\nOther notable riders to take part in the race included several sprinters. One of these was Peter Sagan (), four times the winner of the points classification in the Tour de France and winner of three stages in the 2011 Vuelta, who was preparing for the World Championships road race the following month. Sagan was considered particularly strong on the easier uphill finishes in the first week. John Degenkolb () had won four stages and the points classification in 2014 as well as five stages in 2012. Nacer Bouhanni (), who had crashed out of the Tour, was expected to compete with Degenkolb in the flat sprints.\nRoute and stages.\nThe first announcement of the route for the 2015 Vuelta a España came in October 2014, when Javier Guillén, the race director, announced that the first stage would take place in Puerto Banús near Marbella on 22 August. It had been decided that the stage would be either an individual time trial or a team time trial. More news came the following month, when Guillén revealed that he had been involved in conversations with Chris Froome and had promised him that the race would include a fairly flat individual time trial of around . He also said that the race would feature \"explosive finals and summit finishes\". The official route announcement came on 10 January 2015 in Torremolinos, along the coast from the start of the first stage in Puerto Banús.\nThe first five stages took place in and around Andalusia in southern Spain; the 2014 Vuelta had also started there. The first stage was a team time trial along the coast from Puerto Banús to Marbella. The next four stages were fairly flat, although Stage 2 finished on a moderately difficult climb. The sixth stage started in Córdoba and finished in Sierra de Cazorla in Jaén on another moderately difficult climb. The seventh stage then returned to Andalusia for the first major difficulty of the race: the first-category summit finish at La Alpujarra. The route then continued along the eastern coast of Spain, with a medium-mountain seventh stage and another first-category summit finish at Benitachell on Stage 9. There was one more medium-mountain stage on Stage 10, taking the riders into the Province of Castellón. This was followed by a transfer that took the riders into Andorra for a three-day spell, beginning with the first rest day. The eleventh stage took place entirely in Andorra; though it was only in length, it included six categorised climbs, including a summit finish, and was described by Eusebio Unzué (the manager of the Movistar team) as \"the toughest Vuelta stage that he has seen in more than 30 years\". Stage 12 took the riders back into Spain for a fairly flat stage, before three consecutive stages with summit finishes. These took place in the mountains of Cantabria and Asturias and were followed by the race's second rest day. The final week of the race included no summit finishes: the first stage was a individual time trial in Burgos and was then followed by three mixed stages that took the riders nearer to the final stage of the race, a sprint stage in Madrid. For the first time, the race organisers also held a women's race on the same day as the final stage, using the same circuit. This race – called La Madrid Challenge by La Vuelta – was won by Shelley Olds.\nThe 2015 Vuelta included nine summit finishes, none of which had previously been used in the race. Unusually, the principal difficulties of the race came in the first two weeks, including all nine summit finishes. It was therefore expected that the climbers would need to attack early in the race, in order to build up a significant lead ahead of the lengthy time trial on Stage 17. The race organisers also hoped to encourage sprinters to take part by including seven fairly flat stages.\nEach road stage (that is, all the stages except the team time trial and the individual time trial) included an intermediate sprint. This was a point where the leading riders in the stage were awarded points in the points classification and time bonuses in the general classification. Many of the stages also included climbs that were categorised by the race organisers according to their difficulty; the leading riders over each of these climbs were awarded points in the mountains classification, with the most difficult climbs earning the most points.\nIn the days before the beginning of the race, there was controversy over the first stage. On arriving at the start, the teams discovered that the route used a variety of road surfaces, crossed sandy sections and included several ramps. As a result, the race organisers decided to neutralise the stage: the teams therefore competed only for the stage victory and for the team classification, not for the general classification.\nRace overview.\nThe team time trial was won by and Peter Velits took the red jersey as the first rider across the line. Since the stage had been neutralised for the general classification, all 198 riders began the second stage on the same time. The stage finished on a moderate climb, where Esteban Chaves () attacked early and took both the stage victory and the lead of the race. A major crash in the final brought down several riders and most riders in the peloton (the main group) were held up, including Fabio Aru and Vincenzo Nibali (). Aru quickly rejoined the peloton; Nibali was forced to chase for a long time. After the stage, a video emerged of Nibali holding on to his team car as it accelerated him back to the peloton. Nibali was therefore fined and excluded from the race.\nThe next stage was a moderately difficult stage that ended in a bunch sprint. Peter Sagan won his first Grand Tour stage in over two years ahead of Nacer Bouhanni (Cofidis) and John Degenkolb (Giant-Alpecin). The fourth stage again included an uphill finish. This stage was also decided in a sprint finish, this time won by Alejandro Valverde. Sagan, who came second, took over the lead of the points classification. A third consecutive bunch sprint came on the fifth stage, which ended on a slight incline. The relatively straightforward stage was won by Caleb Ewan (), who was riding his first Grand Tour, ahead of Degenkolb and Sagan. There were splits in the peloton at the finish; Chaves lost six seconds to Tom Dumoulin (), who therefore took over the red jersey of the race leader by one second. This lead did not last long. The sixth stage finished on another moderate climb. Chaves again attacked early in the climb and took his second stage victory, with Dan Martin () second and Dumoulin third. Chaves therefore took back the red jersey.\nThe seventh stage was the most significant uphill finish of the race so far, finishing on the climb of the Alto de Capileira. It was won by Bert-Jan Lindeman () from the breakaway. Most of the general classification favourites finished together, though Fabio Aru gained seven seconds in the final kilometre and Chris Froome lost nearly half a minute. The following stage was a moderately difficult stage: it was too difficult for the pure sprinters to reach the finish line with the main group of riders, but not difficult enough to create gaps between those riding for the overall victory. The most notable event was a large crash from the finish. Four riders were immediately forced to withdraw from the race with injuries, including Dan Martin, who had been in the top ten. The stage was won in a reduced bunch sprint by Jasper Stuyven (), who had been among the riders injured in the earlier crash. He was forced to withdraw from the race after the stage with a broken scaphoid. Stage 9 ended with a difficult climb. There was a series of attacks on the early part of the mountain, with many riders dropped from the lead group. Tom Dumoulin eventually took a solo win in the stage, two seconds ahead of Chris Froome, and took back the red jersey as Chaves lost significant time. Froome had originally been dropped, but rode at a steady tempo and came close to the stage victory. Stage 10, the final stage before the first rest day, ended in another bunch sprint, which was won by Kristian Sbaragli ().\nThe eleventh stage, the first after the rest day, was the difficult stage in Andorra, with six difficult climbs and almost no flat roads. The stage was won from a breakaway by Mikel Landa (Astana). Fabio Aru, Landa's teammate, took second place and moved into the race lead. Chris Froome fell from his bike at the beginning of the stage and lost several minutes to Aru; the following morning it was revealed that he had broken his foot in the fall and he withdrew from the race. Nairo Quintana also lost several minutes on the stage. The following stage, which took the riders from Andorra back into Spain, was won in a sprint by Danny van Poppel () after the day's breakaway was caught in the final kilometre. Van Poppel won the stage despite puncturing his tyre with remaining. The thirteenth stage – the last one before a series of three consecutive summit finishes – was won from a breakaway by Nelson Oliveira (), with no impact on the general classification.\nThe first of the three summit finishes – Stage 14 – was won by Alessandro De Marchi (), who had been in the day's breakaway. Quintana gained several seconds back, while Aru, Rodríguez, Chaves and Majka all gained time on Dumoulin. Rodríguez attacked strongly on the final climb to win Stage 15 and gained time on all his rivals, putting himself just one second behind Aru. Dumoulin lost further time to Aru, Majka and Chaves. The final stage with a summit finish was Stage 16: it was a difficult stage including seven climbs and was won by Fränk Schleck (Trek Factory Racing). On the final climb, Rodríguez gained two seconds on Aru in the final metres to put himself into the race lead for the final rest day, while Dumoulin lost more time and was nearly two minutes back.\nAfter the rest day came the race's individual time trial. It was won by Dumoulin, who was more than a minute ahead of all the other riders in the race. His time was good enough to put him into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, and was only three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage. Rodríguez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin. Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin and fell to fourth place.\nFollowing the time trial, there were three mountainous stages, although none of them had a summit finish. All three were won by riders from breakaways. Nicolas Roche (Sky) won Stage 18, beating Haimar Zubeldia (Trek Factory Racing) in a two-man sprint. After his team had put pressure on the peloton through the whole stage, Aru attacked Dumoulin six times on the final climb, and Valverde put in three more attacks. Dumoulin, however, did not lose any time and retained his three-second lead. Stage 19 ended with a short, cobbled climb into Ávila. It was won by Alexis Gougeard (), who had escaped from the breakaway group on the previous climb. The day's racing also produced another crash: this time Aru fell to the ground. Although he had to make several trips to the medical car, he did not seem seriously injured. At the end of the stage, Dumoulin used his team to put him in a strong position for the cobbled climb and he increased his lead over Aru to six seconds. Stage 20 was the final day of mountainous terrain, including four difficult climbs. It was won by Rubén Plaza (Lampre-Mérida) after a solo breakaway that lasted over three hours. Aru's Astana team rode hard in the second half of the stage and, with a strong team effort, they were eventually able to drop Dumoulin on the penultimate climb of the day; he dropped further back on the final climb and lost nearly four minutes, dropping to sixth place overall. Quintana and Majka gained nearly a minute on the other general classification rivals. This meant that Aru took the race lead, with Rodríguez second and Majka third.\nThe final stage of the race was a flat stage that finished in Madrid. It was won in a sprint by Degenkolb. During the stage, Valverde took advantage of a puncture for Rodríguez and won the intermediate sprint to give him the points jersey. Although Aru lost a little time in a split in the peloton at the finish line, the rest of the standings were unchanged. Aru therefore won the race, his first Grand Tour victory.\nClassification leadership.\nThe 2015 Vuelta a España included four principal classifications. The first of these was the general classification, which was calculated by adding up each rider's times on each stage and applying the relevant time bonuses. These were 10 seconds for the stage winner, 6 seconds for the rider in second, and 4 seconds for the rider in third, and 3, 2 and 1 seconds for the first three riders at each intermediate sprint; no bonuses were awarded on the time trial stages. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Vuelta. The rider leading the classification wore a red jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders were awarded points for finishing in the top fifteen places on each stage and in the top three at each intermediate sprint. The first rider at each stage finish was awarded 25 points, the second 20 points, the third 16 points, the fourth 14 points, the fifth 12 points, the sixth 10 points, down to 1 point for the rider in fifteenth. At the intermediate sprints, the first three riders won 4, 2 and 1 points respectively. The rider with the most points won the classification and wore a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs. Stages were categorised as third-, second-, first- and special-category, with the more difficult climbs rated higher. The most difficult climb of the race, the Alto Ermita de Alba on Stage 16, was given its own category as the Cima Alberto Fernández. Points were awarded for the first riders across the summit of each climb; the rider with the most accumulated points won the classification and wore a white jersey with blue polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the combination classification. This was calculated by adding up each rider's position on the other three individual classifications. The rider with the lowest cumulative score was the winner of the classification and wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated by adding together the times of each team's best three riders on each stage. The team with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the classification. There was also a combativity prize awarded on each stage; three riders were chosen on each stage by a race jury to recognise the rider \"who displayed the most courageous effort\". There was then a public vote to decide which rider should be awarded the prize; the rider wore a red \"dossard\" (race number) the following day. An identical procedure took place on the final stage to decide the most combative rider of the whole Vuelta."

This first course was in Nepal 'browns', i.e. greens consisted of sand mixed with oil. King Tribhuvan Shah and his son Prince Basundhara Shah also played golf.\nWhen the adjacent airfield was expanded, the golf course had to be shortened. On September 5, 1965, the club received the \"designation 'Royal (patronage)\"' by King Mahendra, the son of Tribhuvan, and the club was named \"The Royal Nepal Golf Club (RNGC)\" and Prince Basundra became the second president of the club. The founder members of the RNGC were the then S.P. Khadgajeet Baral (Retd. IGP), the then tennis champion Hem Lama, etc. The members were mostly foreigners and members of the Shah and Rana families. When the airport was expanded again in 1982, the golf course was remodeled.\nIn 1983, the Royal Nepal Golf Course was awarded another ground. They started with the construction of six par-3 holes. A year later two par-3 holes and a par-4 hole with. In 1986, she gained more ground so there finally came a full 9-hole course. In the year 1989, all the greens were modernized with the use of bermuda grass by the then President of RNGC, Khadgajeet Baral.\nThe club has a very challenging 9-hole golf course which organizes over 26 golf tournaments annually, and had held the first ever Nepal Open Golf tournament for professionals of the region for 6 years. All the professionals described the course as \"highly challenging but fair golf course with a fantastic view of the Himalayas\"."

Seven national teams were sent, with 10 cyclists each from Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France. France additionally sent five regional teams of 10 cyclists each, divided into Ile de France, Center-North East France, South East France, West France and South West France. One Luxembourgian cyclist did not start, so 119 cyclists started the race.\nThe winner of the previous edition, Fausto Coppi, did not defend his title, apparently due to injury. The reasons were not clear: it could have been injury, but it was also possible that Coppi did not want to ride in the same team as his rival Gino Bartali, or that the Tour direction urged the Italian team not to select Coppi because he had dominated the 1952 Tour, or that Coppi chose to prepare for the 1953 UCI Road World Championships. The big favourites became Hugo Koblet and Louison Bobet.\nThe last five editions had been won by Italian and Swiss cyclists, so the French cycling fans were anxious for a French win. When team manager Michel Bidot had selected Bobet as the French team captain, controversy arose. Bobet had shown his potential strength, but had already tried to win the Tour de France five times without succeeding. His teammate Raphaël Géminiani thought that Bobet was not strong enough, after he did not finish the 1953 Giro d'Italia earlier that year."

In total, 110 cyclists started the race.\nNotable absents were the Italian cyclists. In Italy, new sponsors had entered the market, named \"extra-sportives\" because they did not sell a product directly related to the sport. During the 1954 Giro d'Italia, this caused a strike, the Bernina strike. After this, the Italian federation decided not to send a team to the 1954 Tour de France."

Unlike Test matches, ODIs consist of one innings per team, with a limit on the number of overs. The limit is currently 50 overs per innings, although in the past this has varied. The earliest match now recognised as an ODI was played between England and Australia on 5 January 1971; since then there have been over 4,000 ODIs played between 26 teams.\nTeam totals have risen steadily throughout the history of ODIs. This has accelerated in recent years, with improvements in techniques, new playing methods and introduction of Twenty20 International cricket. The highest team total before 400 runs was reached was the 398/5 scored by Sri Lanka against Kenya on 6 March 1996 at Asgiriya Stadium, Kandy.\nThe 400 marks were first broken during a notable match between South Africa and Australia, with both teams passing 400 runs in their respective innings. As batting powerplays and other fielding restrictions have come into play, 400+ totals have become more common. Seven international teams have scored 400+ totals in their matches. South Africa has recorded more 400+ scores in ODIs than any other nation, with eight such scores as of October 2023. There have been two occurrences where both teams in a match have scored more than 400 in their respective innings, with the first one being the Australia and South Africa match in 2006, and the other occurrence being India and Sri Lanka in 2009. There has been one other occasion in which a team scored 400+ and lost: New Zealand made 401/6 against Pakistan at the 2023 Cricket World Cup, and Pakistan successfully chased the reduced target.\nAs of 12 November 2023, there have been 27 occasions where a team has recorded a 400+ total.\nThe highest score in ODIs was achieved by England, who scored 498/4 in 50 overs against Netherlands at VRA Cricket ground on 17 June 2022.\nListing notation.\nTeam notation\nBatting notation\nBowling notation"

        "title": "2015 Serena Williams tennis season",
        "text": "The 2015 Serena Williams tennis season officially began on 19 January with the start of the 2015 Australian Open and ended with the 2015 US Open. Williams entered the season as the number one ranked player and the defending champion at seven tournaments, including the US Open and the WTA Finals.\nDuring the season, Serena logged her 700th career victory by defeating Sabine Lisicki during the Miami Open, becoming the 8th woman to accomplish the feat. On October 5, Williams surpassed Chris Evert for third-most weeks ranked world no. 1. Williams finished the year at no. 1, and held the ranking for the entire year. She became the first person since Steffi Graf in 1990 to hold the top ranking for two consecutive years. It is also fifth time that Williams ended as the number 1 player in the year. She was also voted WTA Player of the Year for the seventh time in her career, and on December 14, 2015, it was announced that \"Sports Illustrated\" named Serena their 2015 Sportsperson of the Year, the third solo woman to earn this honor. On December 22, 2015, Serena announced as the 2015 ITF World Champion for the fourth consecutive year and the sixth time in her career.\nYear in detail.\nAustralian Open Series.\nHopman Cup.\nWilliams began preparation for the first grand slam of the year at the Hopman Cup, where she partnered compatriot John Isner to represent team USA. The pair played their first tie against Italy. Williams got off to a slow start in her singles match against Flavia Pennetta, unable to win a game in the first set. However, a mid-match coffee helped the American turn things around and win the match in three sets. She then teamed up with Isner to win the mixed doubles in a super tiebreak. In the second tie of the exhibition, Williams faced off against Canadian youngster Eugenie Bouchard. The American suffered her first loss in her Hopman Cup history, having previously gone undefeated in her last two campaigns, managing to win only three games. Later Williams teamed up with Isner to win their mixed doubles match in straight sets. In the final round-robin tie of the tournament, Williams came up against Czech lefty Lucie Šafářová in an encounter that lasted over two and a half hours, with the American narrowly clinching victory in a third set tiebreak, 8 points to 6. Team USA also won their mixed doubles match, putting Serena in the Hopman Cup final for the third time in as many attempts. In the final Williams met Poland's Agnieszka Radwańska, to whom she had never lost before. The world No. 5 was in inspired form and took the match in three sets. Williams' teammate Isner managed to salvage and send the tie in to a live mixed doubles rubber after winning his singles match against Janowicz; however, the Poles proved too strong for the Americans and took the Hopman Cup with a two set victory.\nAustralian Open.\nAt the first major of 2015 Williams opened her campaign for a 6th Australian Open title against Alison Van Uytvanck of Belgium. The world No. 1 was dominant in taking the first set without dropping a game in 21 minutes. A tighter second set followed giving the American her 15th first round win at the tournament in as many tries. In the second round Williams came up against former world No. 2 Vera Zvonareva, a rematch of the 2010 Wimbledon final. Williams fell behind and then responded by rattling off ten consecutive games to win in two sets and advance to the final 32. Serena was also scheduled to play doubles with her sister Venus, drawing Anabel Medina Garrigues and Yaroslava Shvedova in the first round; however, the pair pulled out without giving an official reason before the doubles tournament began and were replaced by an alternate team. In the third round Williams came up against Ukrainian counter-puncher Elina Svitolina and after overcoming a slow start, which saw her drop the first set, she fought back to take the match in three sets, hitting 45 winners to her opponent's 27. The trend of sluggish starts continued in the fourth round where Williams came up against her conqueror from the previous year's French Open, Garbiñe Muguruza. As in their previous meeting the young Spaniard took the opening set from a flat-footed Williams. The pair exchanged breaks early in the second set but the world No. 1 raised her level to earn the decisive break in the eighth game and take set two. After a difficult opening service game in the third set, in which Williams saved six break points, the American blasted a total of 15 winners to take the third set and the match. At the quarterfinal stage Williams earned her most comfortable victory of the tournament against the previous year's surprise finalist Dominika Cibulková. The top seed hit 15 aces and dropped just four games en route to setting up a final four meeting with her sister's conqueror Madison Keys. Williams had never failed to win the title in Melbourne once making it to the semifinal stage; however, she was broken in the first game and struggled to get into her Fed Cup teammate's service games. Williams eventually broke back in sixth game and won the set in a tiebreak. The world No. 1 coasted in set two and closed out the match on her ninth match point. With passage in to her 23rd Grand Slam final Williams secured she would maintain the number 1 ranking. In the final she came up against her long-time rival and world No. 2 Maria Sharapova to whom she had not lost to in 15 consecutive meetings. Williams began the match aggressively and broke Sharapova's serve immediately. The match continued with serve until the pair traded breaks in the seventh and eighth games, then the world No. 1 broke to love to take the first set from the 2008 champion. The second set was more tightly contested with both women creating break point opportunities but ultimately going with serve to a tiebreaker. Sharapova saved two championship points on her own serve, but Williams' won on her third championship point for her 19th major title. Williams ended the match with 38 winners, including 18 aces and only 25 unforced errors to Sharapova's 21 winners, including 5 aces and 15 unforced errors. With this win Williams broke her tie with Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova for second most Grand Slam singles titles in the Open Era and put herself only three major wins behind Steffi Graf's 22.\nFed Cup World Group II.\nFresh off her victory in Melbourne, Williams flew to Buenos Aires to represent the USA in their tie against Argentina in the Fed Cup World Group II. Serena was nominated to play her first rubber against Argentine No. 2 María Irigoyen. Williams initially struggled to adapt to the clay as the pair went with serve for most of the first set. Williams then won the final eight games of the match to win in straight sets. Williams was nominated to play her second singles rubber against Argentine No.1 Paula Ormaechea; however, she was replaced by CoCo Vandeweghe due to illness. USA won the tie 4–1 and advanced to the Fed Cup World Group play-offs.\nIndian Wells and Miami.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nShortly after winning the first Grand Slam of the season, Williams, in an exclusive column for TIME magazine, announced her intention to end her 13-year boycott of Indian Wells and return to the tournament for the first since winning the title in 2001. Her highly anticipated opening match was set for 13 March when Monica Niculescu advanced to the second round. Williams' return to Stadium 1 at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden was welcomed with rapturous applause and a standing ovation from those in attendance, including tournament owner Larry Ellison, co-founder of Microsoft Bill Gates and tennis legend John McEnroe. Despite the warm reception Williams was tense and was broken immediately by Niculescu, who went on to serve for the opening set in the tenth game, but Williams' resilience saw her win three consecutive games to take the set. In the second set, the pair traded breaks early on and, just as in the first set, the American got the decisive break in the twelfth game to win the match. In the third round Williams made quick work of an error-strewn Zarina Diyas, losing only two games, concluding with a second set bagel. In the round of 16, Williams faced compatriot Sloane Stephens. A sharp and engaged Stephens got an early lead, taking the first three games, but Williams responded by winning the next three to level the match. The set remained on serve with Stephens saving a set point in the tenth game to force it to a tiebreak, which the younger American won. Williams fought back breaking Stephens' serve a collective four times over the final two sets to advance to the final eight. At the quarterfinal stage Williams took on an in-form Timea Bacsinszky whom advanced to the final eight off the back of winning back-to-back titles in Mexico. The Swiss led the opening set in its early stages; however, as in her opening match, Serena came from behind and claimed the first set, with the decisive break coming in the twelfth game. The second set started with four consecutive breaks of serve. Williams righted the ship with a break of serve in the eighth game, which she backed up by serving out the match to 15 to secure a spot in the semifinals. Williams finished the match with 23 winners to her opponents' 11, including 7 aces. Williams was set to face world No. 3 Simona Halep at the semifinal stage but had to withdraw before the match due to a right knee injury. After her withdrawal was announced to those in attendance Williams came out on to Stadium 1 court to address the crowd, apologize for her withdrawal and reassure fans that she would be back in 2016.\nMiami Open.\nWilliams returned to Miami the following week with aims to defend her title and to further extend her record and become the only player to have won the event eight times. After receiving a bye in to the second round as the top seed, Williams was pitted against Monica Niculescu in her opening match for the second straight tournament. The world No. 1 made light work of the Romanian this time, dropping just four games and showing no signs of the knee injury that forced her to withdraw from Indian Wells. In the third round Williams needed only 41 minutes to overwhelm the incumbent ITF junior world No. 1 Catherine Bellis, dropping just 14 points in her victory over the teenager. Serena then took on old rival and 2006 Miami champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round. Williams went untroubled on serve, saving all four break points against her and broke the Russian's serve three times en route to a comfortable victory, the most lopsided win for Serena since 2004. In the quarterfinals the world No. 1 faced off against her conqueror at 2013 Wimbledon Championships, Sabine Lisicki. The in-form German tested the world No. 1 with her big return game but despite leading Williams by a break twice in the first set she was broken back immediately on both occasions. Williams eventually took the first set in a tiebreak and broke Lisicki's serve to begin the second set; however, Williams began to struggle with the sun while serving and went on to commit 17 unforced errors to drop the set. Frustrated with her play, Williams refocused and cleaned up her errors to gain a decisive break in the second game and take the set and match in the third. This victory marked Williams' 700th career win, the most among active players and ninth on the all-time list. In the semifinals she faced third seed and the last player to beat her, Simona Halep, in a match that was originally set to take place two weeks earlier. Williams came out firing, blasting 13 winners to Halep's 6 to take the opening set. The second set went with serve until errors started to flow from Williams' racket which the Romanian was the beneficiary of in the ninth game. Halep served out the set. The world No.1 ended the set with 20 unforced errors to Simona's 10. Williams struck back immediately breaking Halep at the first opportunity in the third set. Williams won a tight third set. In the final Williams faced her sister's conqueror Carla Suárez Navarro. The Spaniard had lost all eight sets contested in four previous meetings with Williams and this was no different with Williams winning in 56 minutes. Williams struck 27 winners, including 7 aces, to 16 unforced errors to successfully defend her title and win Miami for a record eighth time. This was also the second time Williams had won three consecutive Miami titles after originally winning the event three consecutive times between 2002 and 2004.\nEuropean clay court swing.\nFed Cup World Group play-offs.\nIn a quest to gain eligibility for the 2016 Summer Olympics Williams began her clay season in Brindisi in a Fed Cup World Group play-off tie against Italy. The American was nominated to play Camila Giorgi in her first rubber and edged out the first set in a tiebreak. Williams broke serve for the first time in the fourth game and wrapped up the match with a second break as the Italian was serving to stay in the match. The tie was locked at 1–1 at the end of day 1 after Williams' teammate Lauren Davis managed to win only three games in her rubber. Williams played Italian No. 1 Sara Errani in her second single rubber and lost just her second set in eight meetings against the Italian. The American's fluctuating level saw her go from a break up to a break down with the Italian serving for the match. The American broke serve and won the set in a tiebreak to level the match. Williams took the third set and ended the match with 70 winners to Errani's 7. With this win team USA led 2–1 and needed one more point to advance back into the World Group. The tie was forced in to a deciding doubles rubber when Christina McHale managed just two games in her loss to Brindisi-born Flavia Pennetta. Williams teamed up with Alison Riske, marking the first time she had played doubles with anyone other than her sister Venus in 13 years, to take on Eranni and Pennetta. The Italian pairing handed Williams her first Fed Cup loss en route to winning the final rubber and clinching the tie 3–2. USA were relegated to World Group II.\nMadrid Open.\nAfter winning a couple of shaky matches on clay in Brindisi, Williams arrived in Madrid to play her first WTA event of the clay season. Her first round opponent was one of the breakout stars of 2015, Madison Brengle. It took Williams just 55 minutes to beat her fellow American, with the loss of just one game, hitting 36 winners to just 18 unforced errors. Williams faced Sloane Stephens, for the second time this season, in the second round. A break of serve in the opening game was enough for Williams to secure the opening set. Stephens failed to win a game in the second set and the No. 1 seed advanced in to the third round in 58 minutes. Williams' third round opponent was familiar foe Victoria Azarenka whom she had not faced in over a year. Despite being down 5–1 in the first set tiebreak, Williams won six consecutive points to claim the set. Azarenka fought back and won the second set. The deciding set went back and forth until William won the tiebreak to advance to the quarterfinals. At the quarterfinal stage Williams dominated clay court specialist Carla Suárez Navarro, hitting 43 winners to 27 unforced errors, for the loss of just four games. This win set up a semifinal encounter with world No. 4 and reigning Wimbledon champion, Petra Kvitová. Williams lost the match in straight sets and was handed her first loss of the year.\nItalian Open.\nWith her win streak snapped, Williams returned to Rome as the two-time defending champion. She opened her defense against world No. 39 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and won comprehensively in just over an hour, striking 25 winners to only 17 unforced errors. Williams was set to face countrywoman Christina McHale in the third round but withdrew before the match citing a right elbow injury. This was the first time Williams headed in to the French Open without winning a warm-up clay tournament since 2010.\nFrench Open.\nTo kick off her French Open campaign, Williams faced off against Czech qualifier and accomplished doubles player Andrea Hlaváčková. The world No. 1 advanced with ease in just under an hour, blasting 25 winners, untroubled by the elbow injury that had forced her to withdraw from Rome. In the second round Williams was pitted against another qualifier, Germany's Anna-Lena Friedsam. The qualifier failed to serve the first set out, but Williams' sloppy play saw her drop the opener. Williams fought back to force a decider, in which she broke in the first and final of Friedsam's service games to advance to the final 32. Her next opponent was close rival and friend Victoria Azarenka. Williams came into this match having never lost to the Belarusian at a major in eight previous meetings. Azarenka started sharp on return, breaking Williams' serve thrice to lead the world No. 1 by a set and a break. Williams battled to break back in the eighth game to level the set. In the tenth game the Belarusian saved a set point but the chair umpire called for the point to be replayed. Williams took her chance and sealed set. Azarenka, furious with the call, let out her frustration by breaking Serena in her opening service game of the deciding set. Williams responded by winning six straight games to take the match in just over two hours, finishing the match with 41 winners to 21 unforced errors. With this win Williams became the first woman in the Open Era to win 50 matches at each Grand Slam. In the fourth round, Williams faced compatriot Sloane Stephens. Stephens took advantage of a slow starting Williams taking the first set losing just a game and breaking the world No. 1's serve thrice. In the second set, Williams came back to break in the seventh game just to be broken back by Stephens. However, Williams broke again in the eleventh and closed it out to push it to a decider. In the final set, Williams broke the younger Americans serve twice, including in the ninth and final game.\nIn the last eight, Williams took on Italy's Sara Errani, Williams dominated the match losing only four games in the match including a breadstick in the first set. Williams hit 39 winners including 10 aces. In the final four, Williams faced first time slam semifinalist Swiss Timea Bacsinszky. In the first, Bacsinszky broke Williams in the fifth game and that was enough for the Swiss to serve it out in the tenth game to take the first set. In the second set, Bacsinszky broke Williams again in the fifth game, but Williams came back and won the next ten games of the match to advance to the finals. In the final, Williams faced first time finalist Lucie Šafářová, Williams broke Šafářová in the fourth game and closed it out in the ninth game. Williams took an early lead, leading with two breaks; however, as Williams tightened up, Šafářová took advantage and brought it back on serve. Williams then broke in the eleventh game and served for the match but Šafářová broke back to push it to a tie-break. Šafářová dominated tie-break. In the final set, Šafářová took the first two games but Williams came back to win the next six game to win the match. The win gave Williams her 20th slam, being the third person to win 20 or more slams and the third person to win each slam at least three times.\nWimbledon Championships.\nDespite the addition of an extra week of grass court events before Wimbledon, the five-time singles champion, did not play a grass court tune-up event coming into this Grand Slam event. In her opening round Williams faced off against Russian qualifier Margarita Gasparyan, whom she struggled with initially, falling a break behind early in the first set, but Williams bounced back to dispatch her opponent in two sets. Her second round match was against talented doubles player Tímea Babos, a match that would last only 59 minutes, with Williams losing only five games. In the third round, against Heather Watson and a partisan crowd, Williams was two points from losing with Watson serving for the match. After 135 minutes, Williams prevailed in three sets. She would face her sister Venus Williams in her fourth round encounter — the earliest the sisters had met at the Championships and the earliest the two had met in a Grand Slam since the 2005 US Open — but it was a routine two set victory for the younger Williams sister.\nIn the quarterfinals, Williams faced Victoria Azarenka. For the second consecutive major Azarenka won the first set with her accurate return game, but Williams raised her level in the second set and after a multi-deuce fourth game, in which Azarenka held serve, Williams ran away with the match, winning seven consecutive games with her pinpoint serving. The world No. 1 went on to seal the match in three sets, serving 17 aces, her best serving performance of the Championships. In the semifinals Williams faced off against world No. 4 Maria Sharapova. Williams defeated Sharapova for the seventeenth consecutive time for the loss of six games to advance to her eighth Wimbledon final. In the final she faced major final debutant Garbiñe Muguruza, the young Spaniard who had handed Williams her heaviest defeat at a major, just a year before. Though Williams' opening service game was broken, she recovered and won the opening set. Williams raced ahead to a double break lead and would serve for the match twice, but the young Spaniard broke the world No. 1 both times. Although Muguruza got the match back on serve, she would still have to serve to stay in the match. Williams broke the Spaniard's serve to win her sixth Wimbledon title and complete the \"Serena Slam 2.0\". The final lasted 83 minutes, with Williams serving 12 aces to 8 double faults, hitting 29 winners to 15 unforced errors, and getting in 37 of 68 first serves. With this victory Serena Williams became the oldest female in the Open Era to win a major singles title, passing the former mark of Martina Navratilova. This win was her twenty-first major singles title, putting her one behind Steffi Graf's Open Era record, and three behind the all-time mark set by Margaret Court.\nSwedish Open.\nImmediately following her triumph at Wimbledon, Williams returned to Båstad after missing the previous edition of the tournament because of a viral illness. The world No. 1 faced Ysaline Bonaventure and needed just 53 minutes to collect a win over the Belgian for the loss of three games. Williams was set to play Klára Koukalová in the round of 16, but withdrew due to an elbow injury.\nUS Open Series.\nCanadian Open.\nWilliams began her US Open Series in Toronto after withdrawing from Stanford with the same elbow injury sustained earlier in the year. After receiving a bye in the first round as the top seed, Williams faced Italian veteran Flavia Pennetta and won in three sets coming from a set and a break down to win. She then beat Andrea Petkovic and Roberta Vinci in straight sets to advance to the semifinals. She lost to 18-year old Swiss Belinda Bencic in three tight sets. During the match she served at 50 percent, committed 59 unforced errors (more than half the points Bencic won) and converted on only 6 of her 20 break point opportunities. It was her second defeat of the year and first on hard court since the 2014 WTA Finals to Simona Halep. The loss also ended William's 18 match winning streak in three-set matches. Coincidentally, the last time she suffered a three-set loss was also in the semifinals of the Canadian Open (against her sister Venus) in 2014.\nCincinnati Open.\nWilliams was the top seed and, after a bye, she defeated Tsvetana Pironkova and Karin Knapp both in straight sets. In the quarterfinals she defeated Ana Ivanovic in three sets and Elina Svitolina in the semifinals in straight sets. She won her fifth title of the year with a two set victory over Simona Halep.\nUS Open.\nWilliams was the top seed and three-time defending champion and hoping to win a calendar year Grand Slam. She started off with Russian Vitalia Diatchenko in the first round where quickly won on the first set, however, Diatchenko retired due to an injury to advance the next round. In the second round, she faced with Dutch Kiki Bertens that lasted in 1 hour and 32 minutes. In the third round, she faced fellow American Bethanie Mattek-Sands where she had a tough momentum that lost on the first set. During the second set, she narrowly avoided upset by Mattek-Sands and quickly regained focus on the third set. In the round of 16, she faced with another fellow American Madison Keys and winning in straight sets. In the quarterfinal stage, she faced her third American opponent in a row, her sister Venus, Serena dominated early in the first set. During the second set, she lost to Venus, and in the third set, she narrowly defeated her sister to advance to the semifinals. In the semifinals, she faced Italy's Roberta Vinci who was on her first Grand Slam singles semifinal. The semifinal match was supposed to play the night before but was delayed due to rain. The odds favored Serena; Vinci had never beaten Serena Williams in all of their four previous meetings, and Serena performed well in the first set. However, she was upset by Vinci and lost the next two sets, ending her bid to win the calendar-year Grand Slam, won last by Steffi Graf in 1988. It was also her first Slam loss since the previous year's Wimbledon.\nChina Open and WTA Finals.\nOn October 2, Williams announced that she is withdrawn in both China Open and the WTA Finals due to injuries. Williams is a defending quarterfinalist in the China Open, while she is a three-time defending champion in the WTA Finals that she is considering to be a fan favorite.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nWilliams' 2015 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\nDoubles schedule.\nWilliams' 2015 doubles tournament schedule is as follows:\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\n\"Ordered by percentage of wins\""

        "title": "2015 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 11",
        "text": "The 2015 Tour de France was the 102nd edition of the race, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Tour started in Utrecht, Netherlands on 4 July and finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 26 July. On 13 July, between stages nine and ten there was a rest day in Pau.\nStage 1.\nThe Tour began on 4 July in the Netherlands, with an individual time trial that started and finished at Jaarbeurs, Utrecht. Because of its length, it did not qualify as a prologue. The course, which featured 20 turns and two roundabouts (traffic circles), was flat and mildly technical.\nThe first rider off the start ramp was Daniel Teklehaimanot of , who became the first black African to compete in a Tour de France. Jos van Emden of set the first good benchmark time, clocking in at 15' 11\". He remained atop the leaderboard until Rohan Dennis of took over with a time of 14' 56\". Dennis, who had clocked an average speed of , held on to win the stage and became the first yellow jersey wearer of the race. With his performance, he established a new record for average speed in a Tour de France individual time trial. Tony Martin of took second, finishing five seconds behind Dennis. Fabian Cancellara (), who came into the event with five previous Tour de France opening time trial victories, finished six seconds off Dennis' time and took third.\nIn the battle for the general classification, Thibaut Pinot of had one of the best times among the favorites for overall classification, 41 seconds behind Dennis, despite not having a reputation as a good time trialist. Tejay van Garderen (BMC Racing Team) and Vincenzo Nibali () also set good times, finishing one and two seconds behind Pinot, respectively.\nStage 1 result and general classification\nStage 2.\nThis flat stage started in Utrecht. The riders rode underneath the Dom Tower and then went to De Meern. The race headed through Gouda before an intermediate sprint in Rotterdam. The peloton continued west through Spijkenisse and Hellevoetsluis, before crossing Haringvliet and Grevelingen. The finish was on Neeltje Jans, an artificial island at the entrance to the Scheldt estuary, in the province of Zeeland. Cycling commentators suggested before the race that strong winds off the sea could have a major impact, potentially splitting the peloton into echelons.\nBefore the start, at km 0, an honorary start in Utrecht, which involved the playing of the French and Dutch national anthems in the presence of Jan van Zanen, Mayor of Utrecht, Christian Prudhomme, the race director and cycling legends Bernard Hinault and Joop Zoetemelk.\nAfter the ceremonies, the race begun, and a breakaway formed, which consisted of 's Bryan Nauleau, Jan Bárta of , Stef Clement representing and 's Armindo Fonseca. The quartet weren't allowed a significant time gap, however, with their maximum lead over the peloton remaining below three minutes throughout the stage. At the intermediate sprint in Rotterdam, won by Barta, their lead was a mere 30\". Whilst he, Clement and Fonesca desperately tried to continue riding before the yellow jersey group, they were caught with to go.\nIt was then that the race headed towards the open sea, and large echelons were formed. The riders were split into three groups, however the last two of those eventually merged. When the situation became clear, 2nd and 3rd placed Tony Martin and Fabian Cancellara, sprinters Mark Cavendish and André Greipel and GC favourites Alberto Contador, Chris Froome and Tejay van Garderen were all shown to be in the first group, whilst leader Rohan Dennis and other GC favourites Vincenzo Nibali, Nairo Quintana, Joaquim Rodríguez and Thibaut Pinot were all in the second group. Thanks to work from world champion Michał Kwiatkowski (who later received the combativity award for his work), , and , the gap continued to increase, eventually reaching over one minute. This was a clear blow to the chances of those caught in the second group.\nDuring the sprint finish, Cavendish had his leadout man Mark Renshaw helping him. However, as Cavendish later said, Renshaw got out of the way too early making for a long sprint. This allowed Greipel, Sagan and Cancellara to catch up. Greipel later won a very close sprint finish, with Sagan second and Cancellara third. Cavendish gave up towards the end and came fourth. Had he continued, and come in third, his teammate Tony Martin would have taken the yellow jersey. Instead, the time bonus for his position was sufficient to grant the yellow jersey to Cancellara. Eventually, the second group arrived 1'28\" behind the winners.\nStage 3.\nThe tour moved to Belgium for the third stage, starting in Antwerp and ending in Huy. The stage proper began at the end of the neutral zone in Boechout, south-west of Antwerp, and continued through Lierre, Aarschot, Tienen and Hannut. Andenne was followed quickly by the first climb of the tour, which was the category 4 \"Côte de Bohissau\". Following a sprint at Havelange, the tour went over the category 4 \"Côte de Ereffe\" and the \"Côte de Cherave\" on the outskirts of Huy. The stage finished on the category 3 Mur de Huy, a climb with a maximum gradient of 19% in the final few hundred metres.\nLike in the previous stage, the day's breakaway was formed immediately after the start. Bryan Nauleau and Jan Bárta were in it again, like the day before, joined by Martin Elmiger representing and 's Serge Pauwels, again making a quartet. This time, they were allowed a slightly bigger lead, as it reached four minutes before the peloton began the chase. Barta won the most combative rider of the day award.\nAs they were being caught, and when the peloton was getting ready to tackle the first climb of the Tour at full speed, (the Côte de Bohisseau) a huge crash occurred in the field. Among those who went down were leader Fabian Cancellara, third placed Tom Dumoulin who was also the leader of the young rider's classification, William Bonnet and Simon Gerrans. The peloton was initially neutralized to allow those riders to catch up so that the riders could come back to the peloton, before being completely stopped at the foot of the ascent. The cause for this was the lack of ambulances and the doctor, who were all busy treating the injured riders. Bonnet, Gerrans and Dumoulin abandoned, soon followed by Dmitry Kozontchuk. Once the race restarted, the Bohissau climb was neutralised.\nGreen jersey holder André Greipel took full points at the intermediate sprint in Havelange, before the climbs of the fourth category Côte d'Ereffe and Côte de Cherave. None of these caused major losses from the GC contenders, although the Cherave did slightly split the bunch. Cancellara was already far back, experiencing the effects from his crash, ensuring a loss of the yellow jersey. On the Mur de Huy, the favourites came to the fore, and it was Joaquim Rodríguez who attacked with to go, ensuring a stage victory for himself. Chris Froome came second, and later took the yellow jersey as Cancellara came in almost twelve minutes after the winner. He gained time over his GC rivals. Later, Froome said, \"I didn’t wake up today thinking I was going to be in yellow\", and, \"That was a real surprise there.\"\nLater in the evening, it was revealed that Cancellara had suffered two transverse process fractures in two vertebrae in his lower back. He abandoned the race.\nStage 4.\nThe fourth stage was the Tour's first entry into France as the peloton covered seven sectors of pavé on the way to Cambrai.\nThis flat stage departed from Seraing heading west through Huy, to Namur, where the riders faced the category 4 \"Côte de la Citadelle de Namur\". The riders passed around the northern outskirts of Charleroi, through Sombreffe and over the first section of cobbles between Pont-à-Celles and Gouy-lez-Piéton. The race then continued towards the south-east to Binche, before an intermediate sprint at Havay. Three-quarters of the way through the stage, after passing through Le Quesnoy, where the race turned north-west, the six remaining sections of pavé followed. Sector 6 arrived before reaching Famars, where the riders turned south-west. Sectors 5 and 4 followed before the turn south-east at Saulzoir. The riders then did have a tarmac surface to Saint-Python. Sectors 3, 2 and 1 then all occurred on the way west to Carnières. The riders then returned to the tarmac surface to the finish line at Cambrai.\nAt the start, a special ceremony was held involving the king of Belgium, Philippe. Once the race got underway, another four-rider breakaway was formed. It consisted of 's Lieuwe Westra, Thomas de Gendt of , Perrig Quémeneur representing and 's Frédéric Brun. Due to the length of the stage, the riders were allowed a bigger time gap—nine minutes before started the pursuit. At the intermediate sprint in Havay, which De Gendt won, the time gap was down to two minutes. Whilst they made it through the first cobbled section together, the peloton continued to speed up, and they were caught before the third sector.\nIn sector 4 (the first of four sectors, counting down to one) the group split into two. Fifty riders were left in the main group, which included most of the general classification favorites. The only main rider missing was Thibaut Pinot, who not only lost in the split, he also had to stop twice for equipment changes and ended up losing 3' 23\" to the stage winner. Vincenzo Nibali attacked three times on the cobbled sectors, but to no avail other than getting him the most combative rider award.\nNone of the other cobbled sectors were sufficient to split the leaders, who prepared for a sprint finish, with riders such as Peter Sagan and John Degenkolb (winner of the cobbled classic Paris–Roubaix earlier in the year) being seen as the most likely to win. With to go, however, Tony Martin attacked. Whilst his lead reached a maximum of a few seconds, the team of race leader Chris Froome, , were happy to give him the yellow jersey. Thus, with only chasing, Martin managed to stay ahead of the bunch with a 3\" advantage, taking the stage and the yellow jersey. It was seen as finally turning his luck, as he had been in second place since the start of the Tour, with time gaps of 5\", 3\" and 1\" after each stage and to a different leader. He later said to the organisers, \"It's a super nice story and it makes me super happy\", and, \"I'm pretty sure to stay in yellow until the Pyrenees\".\nStage 5.\nThe first full stage in France covered a relatively flat course. Expected to be the first proper stage for sprinters, the stage began in Arras and headed north to the outskirts of Lens, before turning south to head through Croisilles and Bertincourt, and on to an intermediate sprint at Rancourt. The peloton turned west at Peronne taking a circuitous route to Albert and on south to Lamotte-Warfusée. The race then continued west into Amiens.\nThe stage was dedicated to the British and Commonwealth soldiers who died during World War I, with sites such as the Arras Memorial, the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, the British cemetery of Sailly-Saillisel, Rancourt Necropolis (as mentioned, home of the intermediate sprint), the Museum of the Great War, the Longueval cemetery of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the Delville Wood South African National Memorial, the Franco-British memorial at Thiepval and the Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial being visited during the stage.\nIt was a rainy and windy day on this stage of the Tour. At the beginning of the race, Nicolas Edet () and Pierre-Luc Périchon () escaped. Edet soon folded back to the bunch, leaving Périchon in the headwind alone. Meanwhile, crashes were occurring in the bunch, notably one that forced Nacer Bouhanni (Cofidis) out of the race after aggravating injuries sustained in the French National Road Race Championships. After some minor gaps, a definite split was caused by the crosswinds, catching out Ryder Hesjedal () and 's riders Richie Porte and Peter Kennaugh. This group would ultimately come in 14' 15\" in arrears.\nPérichon was caught with to cover and nobody tried his luck from that point. A bunch sprint organized itself with all the main sprinters present. André Greipel of won it to bank his second victory at this Tour de France, with second place belonging to Peter Sagan () who made a late surge for the line. Mark Cavendish () rounded off the podium. The \"most combative\" award was given to Michael Matthews (), who fought on to finish the stage despite riding with two broken ribs. Tony Martin's () overall lead was unchanged.\n\"It was quite an interesting sprint as no one of the sprinters had a real lead-out man in the last 400 metres\", Greipel said after the stage. \"So everybody had to time the sprint somehow and find the right position.\"\nStage 6.\nThe stage departed from Abbeville and headed west to Dieppe, which was followed quickly by two category 4 climbs, the \"Côte de Dieppe\" and the \"Côte de Pourville-sur-Mer\". The peloton then continued west along the English Channel coast to Saint-Valery-en-Caux, then on to Fécamp, which was followed by an intermediate sprint at Saint-Léonard. The race continued to Étretat, which was followed quickly by the category 4 climb of the \"Côte de Tilleul\". The peloton continued south along the coast to Sainte-Adresse on the outskirts of Le Havre. This stage did not have a typical sprint finish, as there was an incline up to the finish line in Le Havre.\nThe day's breakaway was formed not too long after the start, and consisted of 's Perrig Quéméneur, ' Kenneth Vanbilsen and Daniel Teklehaimanot of . The peloton, recovering from the crashes in the previous stages, had a rather slow speed, and thus the trio of riders were allowed a lead which topped 12'30\" before started pursuit. Teklehaimanot took the available points at the three climbs which meant he took the polka-dot jersey as leader of the mountains classification, becoming the first black African to do so. Towards the end, the breakaway split, with Vanbilsen trying an attack for the day's combativity award (it actually went to Quéméneur). Quéméneur and Teklehaimanot were caught with to go, whilst the rider still had an advantage of 25\". He was ultimately caught with to go and the peloton prepared for a finish.\nThe stage finished on a short incline ( at an average 7%), then there was of flat terrain to the line. With about to go, a crash occurred in the peloton, causing race leader Tony Martin and general classification favorite Vincenzo Nibali to fall. Zdeněk Štybar took advantage of this, as he jumped from the peloton amidst all the confusion and took a stage win, finishing two seconds ahead of the group. Peter Sagan was left in the chasing position behind, but refused to take on the workload as there were teams with more than one unit in the group. He finished second.\nŠtybar later said \"I have mixed feelings after winning this stage because Tony Martin crashed\". In the evening, it was announced that Martin suffered a broken collarbone and would be unable to start the next stage, as he was flying to Hamburg for surgery.\nStage 7.\nThe riders departed from Livarot, the first time the commune was used for the start or finish of a stage, in another stage for the sprinters. The race quickly headed over the category 4 \"Côte de Canapville\" and on through Vimoutiers and Argentan, where an intermediate sprint took place. After heading south-west to Saint-Martin-des-Landes, the peloton then headed west through Lassay-les-Chateaux, Ambrières-les-Vallées and Gorron before heading into Fougères. After his crash the day before, the leader Tony Martin had to withdraw from the race, meaning no-one wore the yellow jersey in this stage. Before the stage, number one general classification rider Froome said: \"Out of respect for Tony I would never have worn it in any case. That's not the way to get the yellow jersey, due to someone else's misfortunes.\" There was another non-starter, Greg Henderson of , because of two broken ribs.\nThe stage was disputed under good weather conditions. During the neutral zone before the start, Alberto Contador and Robert Gesink of went down on the asphalt but didn't sustain any injuries. Once the flag was dropped to start the race, five riders came through as the day's breakaway – the mountains classification leader Daniel Teklehaimanot, Kristijan Đurasek of , ' Luis Ángel Maté and two riders from the local team – Anthony Delaplace and Brice Feillu. Teklehaimanot took full points on the only categorised climb of the day. Meanwhile, and heavily controlled the pace of the peloton, in an attempt for their sprinters to try and fight for the stage. Thus, the breakaway's lead only topped four minutes. Despite this, the five at the front proved very difficult to catch, as they were caught with only until the finish.\nAt the finish, Mark Cavendish, André Greipel, Peter Sagan and John Degenkolb all went for the final sprint, and were practically neck and neck until the finish, when Cavendish caught Greipel's slipstream and took his 26th success at the tour, and his first for nearly two years. Greipel managed second and Sagan took third. The 'Manx Missile', as Cavendish is known, dedicated the victory to his teammate Tony Martin, who was recuperating from a collarbone operation. Froome regained the yellow jersey. After the stage, it was announced that Luca Paolini () had tested positive for cocaine and was excluded from the race.\nStage 8.\nThe peloton headed out of Rennes with racing officially starting at Montgermont, heading north-west to Bécherel, west to Saint-Méen-le-Grand, and then north-west again to Plénée-Jugon. This was followed by the category 4 \"Col du Mont Bel-Air\" and an intermediate sprint at Moncontour. The race then headed south through Loudéac to Rohan and turned west to Neulliac. The peloton continued to Mûr-de-Bretagne, travelling through the commune before arriving at the final climb for the day. The category 3 climb of Mûr-de-Bretagne, up to the finish line, was at a gradient of 6.9%.\nFour riders attacked at km 0 and became the day's breakaway. These riders were Pierre-Luc Périchon of , Bartosz Huzarski of , 's Sylvain Chavanel and Romain Sicard of . Their maximum lead reached four minutes before took up pursuit at the head of the peloton. At the intermediate sprint, a group of 17 riders went clear of the peloton. They joined the initial breakaway, before Huzarski attacked again, this time taking 's Lars Bak and 's Michał Gołaś with him. The lead of these riders reached 1'12\". Huzarski (the recipient of the day's combativity award) gave up with to go, but Bak and Gołaś continued fighting. However, they only managed to last another before being brought back by the peloton.\nAt the Mûr-de-Bretagne, Froome led the peloton, but was unable to keep going for a stage victory, as Alexis Vuillermoz attacked with to go and managed to take the stage victory for himself It was the first French triumph in this year's Tour. He later said \"After winning I thought about my dad who died three years ago. He was the one who got me interested in the Tour de France, he used to take my cousins and I to the side of the road to watch the Tour go past\", said Vuillermoz. \"I hope today he's proud of me.\" Dan Martin came in second position, after trying an attack but leaving it until too late. Nibali lost ten seconds to all GC contenders, and later said \"I had a bad day. I felt good at the beginning of the stage but at the end, I couldn’t feel anything anymore, I didn’t have any legs anymore.\" Peter Sagan grabbed the green jersey by three points as André Greipel didn't feature in the finish.\nAfter the stage, the UCI proceeded to randomly check five riders' bicycles for hidden motors as a part of the mandatory control efforts. All passed inspection as nothing was found.\nStage 9.\nThere had not been a team time trial (TTT) this late into the Tour de France since 1982. TTT stages in the Tour usually take place in opening days because of the likelihood that all of the team's riders would still be participating. The teams started in the reverse order that they were placed in the team classification, with the exception of the team which included the general classification leader, which was Chris Froome's , who started last. In this stage, the teams had to have five riders crossing the finish line, and the time of this fifth cyclist was the one that counted.

Froome kept the yellow jersey with an advantage of twelve seconds over Tejay van Garderen. Van Garderen later said \"We knew we were on a really good ride\", and \"In a perfect world, we would have taken the stage and the yellow jersey. But we will take the stage win. Honestly, I couldn't be happier.\"\nRest day 1.\nThe riders transferred to Pau for the rest day. Ivan Basso of the team announced that he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer and that he was withdrawing from the race. His road captain, Alberto Contador, was emotional when talking to the press and Basso received support from a number of people including Lance Armstrong. Basso made the announcement in English to the media: \"I have a bad announcement to give to you guys. On stage 5, I had a really small crash but in the crash I touched my testicle on the saddle and for a few days, I felt a small pain. Yesterday we spoke with the doctor of the Tour de France and we decided to go to make a special analysis in the hospital and the examination gave me bad news. I have a small cancer in the left testicle.\"\nAbout the race, race leader Chris Froome () said: \"This first week, the big thing was not to lose any time. So to gain quite substantial amounts of time, that is the dream scenario. I have my team to thank for that. They have been there every step of the way, after all these one-day Classics I couldn’t be in a better position.\"\nAlberto Contador () did not lament his time deficit: \"We’ll see how everyone is in the mountains. I believe that a lot is still to happen in this Tour and everybody will have \"días malos\", bad days. Hopefully we will have none\", said the Spaniard. \"This Tour will be won by regularity and I hope that this favours me.\"\nNairo Quintana of was sitting ninth on the general classification at 1' 59\" and reflected: \"The roster is still full, with a couple of crashes yet with no major complications, and performing really well, as everyone could see yesterday in the team time trial. I think that the Pyrenees, with Alejandro and all of them by my side, will be a good opportunity to turn things around in our favour.\"\nTejay van Garderen () said about the mountains to come: \"I don’t think my strength is going to be flying up the road and dropping people like Quintana and Contador, my strength is going to be my consistency\", said the American. \"In the Pyrenees I’m going to have to mark the guys who are important and take the opportunity if it's there.\"\nVincenzo Nibali of the squad was shocked by the news of his fellow countryman Basso's cancer. He nonetheless talked about the upcoming race in those terms: \"I want to see if the real Nibali is around. More than anything, I want some answers for myself. I still haven’t felt as good as I did last year, I hope it happens starting from tomorrow (Tuesday). Will I attack? We’ll see... If there's a chance, why not?\"\nStage 10.\nBastille Day featured the first mountainous stage of the 2015 Tour, departing from Tarbes, with racing officially starting at Bordères-sur-l'Échez.

Shortly after the beginning of the final climb, the break was swept up by the leading group. The climb had barely started when polkadot jersey wearer Daniel Teklehaimanot () was dropped, along with Kwiatkowski. Soon, Thibaut Pinot and Jean-Christophe Péraud, the third and second overall of last year's Tour respectively were distanced too.\nA select group of twelve riders resisted with to cover, at which point Nibali was distanced. Chris Froome () attacked with remaining, as there was only Nairo Quintana and teammate Richie Porte with him. He dropped them both with that acceleration, won the stage in solo fashion and put considerable time into all his general classification rivals. Porte was second, followed by Quintana at one minute and four seconds. 's Robert Gesink, who had attacked shortly after the beginning of the climb, reaped a fourth position. Tejay van Garderen finished tenth at 2' 30\", Contador at 2' 51\" and Nibali at 4' 25\". Contador blamed the performance on respiratory problems.

He was an All-American college player at the College of Steubenville (now Franciscan University of Steubenville) and was a second-round pick in the 1958 NBA draft.\nSmith was born James Betsil and played his first two years of high school basketball at Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During the Summer before his junior year, he transferred to Homestead High School in Homestead, Pennsylvania. He made the move largely to increase his chances of playing college basketball, going so far as to move in with a local family (who became his legal guardians) and legally changing his name to James Smith. Following his high school career, Smith went to Steubenville for college, becoming perhaps the greatest player in school history. He was twice named an All-American, averaged over 20 rebounds per game and scored 2,048 points for his career.\nFollowing the close of his college career, Smith was drafted in the second round of the 1958 NBA draft (15th pick overall) by the Boston Celtics. However, he was drafted into the United States Army as well. Smith was discharged in 1960 due to knee problems, injuries that ultimately derailed his professional basketball career. Smith ultimately became an activist for racial integration and later a public servant. He died on May 5, 2002, due to complications from leukemia."

        "text": "Allen Chapman (born July 23, 1991) is a former American football cornerback. He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Indianapolis Colts in 2013. Chapman played in the Indoor Football League (IFL). He played college football at Kansas State.\nHigh school career.\nChapman attended Oak Grove High School in San Jose, California, where he played football and basketball. He earned All-BVAL first-team honors in 2007 and 2008, and was the 2008 Most Valuable DB. As a senior, he recorded 34 tackles, 3 interceptions, 4 passes defended and a forced fumble. He also rushed for 332 yards and 8 touchdowns.\nCollege career.\nCommunity college.\nChapman was not offered any scholarships after graduating from high school, so he decided to stay close to home and play for the City College of San Francisco Rams. In his two years with the Rams, he compiled 39 tackles, 15 interceptions, 2 fumble recoveries, 3 touchdowns and a sack. With the help of future Wildcats teammate Nigel Malone, he led his team to a 12–1 record in 2010, as well as the school's 11th NorCal Championship. They eventually lost in the state championship to Mt. San Antonio College.\nChapman was drawing interest from several NCAA Division I schools. He was now considered a three-star prospect by \"Rivals.com\" and received interest from a dozen D-I schools. He accepted a scholarship from Kansas State over other offers from New Mexico, New Mexico State, and Tulsa in order to play for head coach Bill Snyder.\nKansas State.\nAs a junior in 2011, he registered 50 tackles, 5 passes defended, a forced fumble and an interception. He returned that interception 60 yards for a touchdown on November 5 against #3 Oklahoma State, but they went on to lose 52–45. His playing time increased as a senior in 2012, and he recorded career highs in tackles (57), interceptions (6) and passes defended (10). On a November 3 game, also against Oklahoma State, he intercepted quarterback Clint Chelf three times, including one for a touchdown. He earned FBS Defensive Player of the Week and Big 12 Defensive Player of the Week honors for his performance.\nProfessional career.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2013 NFL draft, the Indianapolis Colts signed him as an undrafted free agent to a rookie contract on May 12, 2013. Coincidentally, the Colts released Nigel Malone (who played with Chapman at CC of San Francisco and Kansas State) in order to make space for the rookie cornerback. However, the Colts released Chapman on August 25 as part of the final roster cuts to trim the roster down to 78 players.\nArizona Rattlers.\nOn November 1, 2013, Chapman (and two other rookies) were assigned to the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League. He played his first game on April 26, 2014, against the San Antonio Talons, where his 4 combined tackles contributed to a 69–59 victory. His first career interception came a few weeks later, when he intercepted a pass by Danny Southwick with 50 seconds left and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown, which clinched a 70–59 victory against the Portland Thunder on a June 6 showdown.\nNew Orleans VooDoo.\nOn March 23, 2015, Chapman was traded to the New Orleans VooDoo, along with Rayshaun Kizer, in exchange for future considerations.\nPortland Thunder.\nOn March 30, 2015, Chapman was traded to the Portland Thunder for claim order positioning.

        "text": "The America's Cup World Series are match races and fleet regattas used as heats for the 2013 America's Cup and the 2017 America's Cup.\nThe Yachts.\nAC45 and AC45F.\nThe World Series uses AC45 catamarans, a one-design wingsail catamaran designed specifically for the event by Oracle Racing. The AC45 was conceived as a smaller version of the larger AC72 class rule which was used for the 2013 America's Cup. In 2015, the class was modified to AC45F which incorporated hydrofoiling capability for improved performance, with boats achieving peak speeds of 37kt.\nThe AC45 has the following specifications:\nTesting platform.\nThe AC45 are authorized to be taken out of measurement to serve as a testing platform for the America's Cup. Oracle Racing released photographs of an AC45 hydrofoiling with L-type appendages on June 18, 2012, a premonition of Team New Zealand's larger foiling AC72 \"Aotearoa\" test boat first spotted in Auckland on August 29, 2012. In February 2015 Oracle Racing and Artemis Racing tested two AC45s modified by Core Builders; They featured L-type hydrofoils, horizontal rudder stabilizers, lengthened crossbeams (herego wide beam), a shortened jib-only bowsprit extending into a centerline pod under the wing, flaring topsides, closed transoms, opened hulls with deep cockpits for binnacles and wheels, replacing the tiller. The authorization does not permit to lengthen the hulls. All other teams carried out similar experiments with the platform.\n2011–13 World Series.\nNine events were held between 2011 and 2012 in the lead up to the 2013 America's Cup.\nIn August 2013, the competition jury received a report from Oracle Team USA that their boat and others they had loaned had unauthorized modifications. Since they were using one of these modified boats, the BAR team withdrew from the competition on 7 August 2013. Oracle Team USA withdrew the day after. Penalties imposed included expelling three team members, a $250,000 fine, and a one-point penalty for each of the first two races of the Match in which they would otherwise score a point.\n2015–16 World Series.\nThe series was revived as heats of nine two-day events in eight venues in the run up to the 2017 America's Cup. The races used a single boat design, known as AC45f, which was based on AC45 with added hydrofoil daggerboards and rudders.\nThe overall winner of the competition was Land Rover BAR, with Oracle Team USA being the runner up. The winner of the series earned two points and the runner-up received a single point in the new America's Cup Qualifiers. The boats are similar to the AC50 used in the 2017 America's Cup.\nCancelled 2018 and 2020 World Series.\nPrior to the 2017 America's Cup, several of the competing syndicates signed an agreement to hold World Series prior to the next two America's Cups, then scheduled for 2019 and 2021. These two World Series would be used as selection series to determine which teams would compete at the 2019 and 2021 Louis Vuitton Cups Challenger Selection Series. These two seasons would have used the AC50-class yachts, instead of the AC45 or AC45F classes. However, the winner of the 35th America's Cup, Emirates Team New Zealand was not a signatory to the agreement for the 36th and 37th America's Cup, making these plans obsolete."

        "text": "Thiago Moura Monteiro (; born 31 May 1994) is a Brazilian professional tennis player.\nMonteiro has a career-high ATP singles ranking of world No. 61 achieved on 17 October 2022. He also has a career-high ATP doubles ranking of No. 144, achieved on 31 January 2022. He is currently the No. 2 Brazilian tennis player. \nOn the ITF Junior Circuit, Monteiro peaked in the rankings at No. 2 on 2 February 2012, with his biggest junior singles title being the Grade A, Copa Gerdau in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2011.\nIn his first ATP match, as a wildcard ranked world No. 338 in the ATP 500 Rio de Janeiro in February 2016, Monteiro upset No. 9 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the first round. In the second round, Monteiro lost to eventual champion Pablo Cuevas.\nIn his next tournament, the ATP 250 São Paulo, Monteiro won two matches (against former World No. 9 Nicolás Almagro, and Daniel Muñoz de la Nava), losing again to eventual champion Cuevas in the quarterfinals.\nOn May 8, 2016, Monteiro won his first ATP Challenger title in Aix-en-Provence, France. He defeated Carlos Berlocq in the final.\nEarly and personal life.\nThiago Moura Monteiro was born on May 31, 1994, in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. Thiago has three sisters (Letícia, Jéssica, and Flávia) and an older brother, Fáber Monteiro, who works as a real estate broker. His mother, Fátima Monteiro, has been retired since he was a child. Monteiro is fluent in Spanish, Portuguese, and English.\nThiago's first introduction to tennis happened when he first saw his brother watching Gustavo Kuerten on TV, being eight years old. Monteiro trained football at an academy near where his brother used to play tennis. He played it for the first time when his football class was cancelled, and his brother called him to \"hit the ball\". Thiago soon started training and disputing local tournaments: in early 2004, he won his first tournament, being only nine years old. Thiago would leave his hometown, Fortaleza, in late 2008 to enter the Larri Passos Academy in Balneário Camboriú to improve his game. Thiago says that he would probably be a football player if he had not made that change. Now, as a professional player, Thiago uses his spare time to enjoy movies and spend it with friends and family. He attends college online. He dated fellow Brazilian tennis player Beatriz Haddad Maia for several years.\nJunior career.\nThiago Monteiro had a successful junior career, winning many tournaments. Monteiro peaked in the ITF Junior Circuit rankings at No. 2 on 2 February 2012. He ended his junior career with a 77–31 win record on singles and 47–32 on doubles.\nIn 2004, being ten years old, Thiago won the Paraíba Tour Tournament. In 2005, Monteiro won the Fortaleza Cup by beating Evandro Alencar in straight sets on the final. In 2006, he captured the first of three titles at the Banana Bowl, in the category u12. 2008 was a very successful year for Monteiro, both in singles and in doubles. He won the South-America Tournament of Nations, the Torneio Brasileirão, the Guanabara Open de Tênis (4th and 5th stage), all singles tournaments; and the 1st and 2nd stage of Torneio Nacional Rota-do-Sol (both in singles and doubles). Monteiro also conquered his second Banana Bowl title, category u14. Later that year, Thiago was awarded with Troféu Jornalista Flávio Ponte, at the category Personalidade Esportiva do Ano (\"Sports Personality of the Year\").\nTo focus on his tennis career, Thiago moved from his hometown in Fortaleza, to Balneário Camboriú, in Santa Catarina. This change led Thiago to conquer multiple titles in 2009: Copa Claro (3rd stage) and Credicard MasterCard Junior Cup (2nd and 3rd stage), in singles tournaments, and the doubles titles at XIV Goodyear Junior Cup and the Eddie Herr Tennis Championship. Monteiro was also runner-up at the G1 tournament, Orange Bowl, playing in the singles draw. This same year, he won his first points on the ATP rankings by playing two Futures' events in the doubles category.\nStarting in 2010, Thiago was number one in both CBT and COSAT ranking. He won his third and final title at the 40th edition of the Banana Bowl, this time in the u16 category, and also made his debut on the ATP Singles Rankings, with his participation in a Future in his birthplace, in Fortaleza. In 2011, Thiago started the year winning the Grade A Copa Gerdau in Porto Alegre, one of the most important tournaments on the ITF Junior Circuit. At 17 years old, Monteiro also won three other clay tournaments: the Asuncion Bowl, Astrid Bowl, and the Offenbach Tournament. In this last one, he defeated Matias Sborowitz on the final in straight sets.\nThiago didn't achieve much success in singles Grand Slams as a junior: his best results were reaching the third round at the Wimbledon Championships in 2011 and 2012 French Open. He had a better run at doubles: reaching the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and the semifinals at the French Open, both in 2012. Monteiro's last match as a junior was at the 2012 US Open.\nProfessional career.\n2011–2013: Early career.\nIn late 2011, Thiago won his first professional title, the Bahia Open, a Future tournament with US$10,000 in money prize. He battled past his training partner Alexandre Schnitman, winning in close, straight sets. This win led Thiago to receive a wildcard entry on the main draw of Aberto de São Paulo, but he was eliminated on the first round by compatriot André Ghem.\n2012 was the last junior year for Monteiro. He played in all junior Grand Slams except Wimbledon and focused on Futures and Challengers tournaments. Monteiro managed to qualify at 2012 Aberto de Florianópolis, in late February, but he was eliminated in the first round by Thiago Alves. In late May, Thiago won his second Futures title, this time on clay, in Bauru. The final was a thrilling three-hour victory over Leonardo Kirche, with Monteiro winning despite losing the first set. The Brazilian was runner-up on two other Futures played in Brazil: at São José do Rio Preto in August and at Porto Alegre in October. Thiago ended the year with a career ranking of 439, after starting the year at the position 701.\nEntering 2013 as the first year that Thiago would play a full season as a senior professional, he was invited a second time to enter Aberto de São Paulo main draw, but couldn't make it past the first round again, losing to countryman Guilherme Clezar in straight sets. Monteiro later played in consecutive Futures events in the United States without much success. He tried to break through the qualifiers of Brasil Open a month later, but lost to Thiago Alves in the first round. In March, Thiago did a very successful run in Turkey: he won two back-to-back Futures, with 15 consecutive victories over two weeks. His first title there was against Czech Jan Minar, winning in straight sets. A week later, he defeated the Dominican José Hernández also in straight sets. He also won his first Futures title in doubles, partnering Maximiliano Estévez, from Argentina, defeating in the finals the partnership of Kirill Dmitriev and Yaraslav Shyla in the super tiebreak.\nThiago would also reach the finals of another Futures event, this time in the Netherlands, in June, but he couldn't win his 5th title. He lost in the final to Bjorn Fratangelo in three sets. Thiago broke through multiple Challenger qualifiers later in the year, including Sport 1 Open in Netherlands, the Poznań Open in Poland, the Oberstaufen Cup in Germany, and the Uruguay Open. His best results were in the quarterfinals in Germany and Netherlands, a performance he also achieved in IS Open and Aberto Rio Preto, but he didn't need to play the qualifiers in the latter. In doubles, Thiago reached the finals of Tetra Pak Tennis Cup partnering Thiago Alves, but they lost in straight sets against the Argentinian team of Guido Andreozzi and Máximo González. He also reached the semifinals of IS Open and Aberto Rio Preto, partnering Thiago Alves in the first and Rogério Dutra Silva in the latter, achieving his career high in the doubles ranking: 449th. He ended in the 276th position in the singles ranking.\n2014–2015: Injuries, Second doubles title.\nThiago's year started only in late February due to an injury on his left knee. He attempted to qualify to Brasil Open, but lost in the second round to Dušan Lajović in straight sets. In March, Thiago qualified to Visit Panamá Cup, defeating Alexander Zverev on his way, but Monteiro lost in the first round. Thiago's 5th Futures title came in late June, in the Netherlands, where he defeated Boy Westerhof in three sets. Thiago was not able to repeat his runs in the Challenger Tour as he did in 2013. His rank dropped down to 563rd by the end of the year. In doubles, Thiago reached the finals of two Futures (one in Netherlands, one in Dominican Republic), but wasn't able to win his 2nd title in either.\nTrying to recover his positions in the ATP rankings, Thiago tried to break through multiple qualifiers of ATP World Tour tournaments. He attempted to do so in clay events, reaching the final qualifying round in the Argentina Open and the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships, losing respectively to Facundo Bagnis and Rogério Dutra Silva. While his run on qualifiers wasn't much successful on the ATP World Tour, Thiago had better success at the ATP Challenger Tour. Over the year, Thiago entered 11 qualifier draws, breaking through 5 of them. Monteiro's also played his last Futures event to date, playing two weeks in Georgia in both singles and doubles. Partnering with the Italian Marco Bortolotti, the left-hander won his 2nd Futures title by defeating the Russian partnership of Victor Badula and Ivan Kalinin in straight sets.\nAlmost a month later, playing in the qualifiers of Poprad-Tatry ATP Challenger Tour, Thiago badly injured his left knee while holding a match point against Czech Robin Stanek and was forced to retire. He stayed away from the courts for three months, returning in the Campeonato Internacional de Tênis de Campinas qualifiers. Monteiro lost in the final qualifying round to Tiago Lopes in three sets. The Brazilian best run at a Challenger event was in November, at the Challenger Ciudad de Guayaquil, passing through the qualifiers and reaching the quarter-finals, where he had to retire against the eventual runner-up, Guido Pella. Thiago ended in the 470th position in the singles ranking.\n2016: ATP World Tour and top 100 debut, Maiden Challenger Title.\nRanked at the beginning of the year at No. 463, Thiago started strong, qualifying to Torneo de Mendoza main draw and reaching the quarterfinals, where Monteiro lost to eventual champion Gerald Melzer in straight sets. The left-hander received a wildcard invite to Vivo Tennis Cup main draw, where he reached the semifinals of a Challenger event for the first time, losing again to the 'would-be' champion of the tournament, this time to Facundo Bagnis. \nThis performance led him to receive a wildcard into Rio Open main draw where he would face Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the third seed and world No. 9 at the time. Thiago (ranked No. 338) stunned Tsonga in three sets, to set a meeting with Pablo Cuevas. Monteiro lost in straight sets, and his opponent won the tournament, defeating Guido Pella in the final. The surprise performance led Monteiro to receive a second wildcard, this time to play into Brasil Open main draw. Thiago started strong, defeating two Spaniards, Nicolás Almagro in the first round and Daniel Muñoz de la Nava in the second, to reach the third round and set another battle against Pablo Cuevas. Thiago triumphed in the first set this time, but Cuevas turned the game and won the match. Cuevas also won this tournament, beating Pablo Carreño Busta in the final.\nAfter rising 98 positions in the rankings, Thiago returned to play on Challenger events, this time all over America. Playing in four tournaments, he reached the semifinals in two of them. The first one was the Challenger ATP Cachantún Cup, where he lost to countryman Rogério Dutra Silva, in March. The other semifinal was his second Challenger event in Brazil in 2016, the São Paulo Challenger de Tênis, where seeded third, he lost to Gonzalo Lama in three sets.\nReturning to Europe, Thiago entered the Open du Pays d'Aix draw unseeded, and with a strong performance, he conquered the title by beating Carlos Berlocq in the final. Thiago played two other tournaments without the same success, before entering the French Open qualifying draw as the 30th seed. Monteiro was beaten in straight sets by Ruben Bemelmans. A week later, Monteiro had a rematch with Bemelmans in the first round of the Franken Challenge, defeating him in straight sets. Thiago later lost in the quarterfinals to Tobias Kamke. Playing in another clay tournament in France, Monteiro reached a second Challenger final, this time at the Open Sopra Steria de Lyon. Seeded 5th, he faced another Belgian this time, Steve Darcis. The left-hander took the first set, but the Belgian grew in the match, turning it into three sets.\nBefore attempting to qualify for his second Grand Slam, Monteiro played at the Internationaux de Tennis de Blois but withdrew from the second round match against Miljan Zekić, citing a back injury. At the Wimbledon Championships qualifying, Thiago was eliminated again in the first round, this time to Julian Reister. To improve his position in the ATP rankings, Thiago attempted and qualified for the German Open main draw. The Brazilian won three matches against three Germans players (two in the qualifiers, and Mischa Zverev in the main draw), to set a third match against Pablo Cuevas. Cuevas delivered Monteiro's third loss in the ATP World Tour, but this time he did not win the tournament, being runner-up instead. Thiago qualified for a consecutive World Tour appearance this time at Swiss Open Gstaad. Monteiro was defeated by Robin Haase in the third round. The Brazilian defeated Antoine Bellier in the first round and the second seed, and top 30 Gilles Simon in the second round.\nAttempting to break into the top 100, Monteiro entered as the top seed in the BB&amp;T Atlanta Open qualifiers. He breezed past American Trent Bryde, winning in straight sets and recording a bagel, but lost to Christopher Eubanks in straight sets, at the final round. However, Rajeev Ram withdrew from the tournament, and Monteiro was awarded a lucky loser entry into the main draw. Unfortunately for Thiago, he didn't have the same luck during the first round match, against Tim Smyczek. Monteiro had the opportunity to serve for the match at 5–4 during the second set, but Smyczek denied his chances and won the match in three sets. Thiago also did his debut in doubles in Atlanta, playing with Yoshihito Nishioka, but they lost at the super tiebreak against American partnership of Zack Kennedy and Christopher Eubanks. \nA week later, Thiago entered directly into the main draw of an ATP event for the first time, the Los Cabos Open; but lost in the first round to Dušan Lajović in straight sets.\nThiago finally broke the Top 100 milestone after winning in the first round of the Western &amp; Southern Open qualifiers against veteran Ivan Dodig in straight sets. However, Thiago failed to qualify as he lost in the final round to Jiří Veselý in three sets. The win also won Monteiro the second spot in the Brazilian Top 10 singles for the first time in his career. Later at the end of August, Thiago tried to qualify at the US Open, but for the third time in the qualifiers, he lost at the first round. After the US Open, Thiago was invited for the first time to play in the Davis Cup. He entered the team to play against Belgium, opening the rubbers against David Goffin. Monteiro lost in straight sets, and Brazil finished the series 0–4. Following his unsuccessful run at the Davis Cup, Thiago entered the Campeonato Internacional de Tenis de Santos as the 2nd seed. He went on to his third Challenger final, losing in straight sets to Renzo Olivo. Thiago ended his year with two other quarterfinals (Campinas and Buenos Aires) and a semifinal (Santiago) appearance at Challenger events.\n2017: ATP 500 quarterfinal, Grand Slam debut and first wins.\nThiago started his year at Chennai Open, losing in the first round to Daniil Medvedev. A week later, he entered the Sydney International qualifiers drew and passed through it, but he came short again in the first round, losing to Daniel Evans. \nRanked No. 83, Thiago's ranking was enough for him to enter the Australian Open main draw directly. He set a rematch against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga but could not reproduce the tennis from their first match, losing in four sets. \nEntering the Ecuador Open, Monteiro's performance was disappointing; he lost another match in the first round, this time to Giovanni Lapentti. He also entered the doubles draw there, playing with Thomaz Bellucci, but they came short in the first round. Playing on Argentinian soil, Monteiro passed the first round, defeating ex-top 10 Tommy Robredo en route to the quarterfinals of the Argentina Open, before losing to local player Carlos Berlocq in three sets. \nMonteiro made a consecutive quarterfinal appearance, this time at the ATP 500 Rio Open, beating Gastão Elias and compatriot Thomaz Bellucci before losing to Casper Ruud. Entering another his home tournament, the Brasil Open, Thiago lost for the second time in a row to Carlos Berlocq.\nA couple of weeks later, in his Masters 1000 main draw debut at Indian Wells Masters, Monteiro lost in a close match to Martin Kližan, losing a set point in the first set tiebreak and six break point opportunities overall. In another close match, Monteiro was also eliminated in the first round of the Miami Open, this time by Viktor Troicki in three sets.\nFollowing the first two Masters of the season, Monteiro played two singles rubbers for his country at the Davis Cup, winning both to help Brazil win 5–0 against Ecuador, classifying his country to the World Group play-offs. Starting the spring clay court season, he entered the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships main draw. At the maroon clay courts, Thiago defeated seventh seed Donald Young in straight sets but lost in three to Ernesto Escobedo. At the Barcelona Open, Thiago qualified for the main draw, but lost to Daniel Evans in the first round. A week after, in the first round of BMW Open, he lost to Marius Copil.\nAt the 2017 French Open he recorded his first win at a Major defeating wildcard Alexandre Müller.

In the semi-final he ended up being eliminated by the No. 21 in the world, the Spaniard Albert Ramos Viñolas, with scores of 6–4, 6–7 (4) and 6–4. He then played several tournaments during the year, with poor results, until reaching the ATP 500 in Hamburg, in July, where he reached his second quarterfinal at the ATP 500 level. Thiago played the qualifier where he won the first game and lost in the second but the Luck allowed him to compete in the main draw as a lucky loser. After beating the No. 39 in the world, Frenchman Gilles Simon, 7–6(2) and 6–2 in the first round, in the round of 16, he played a battle against the world No. 33, the Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, winning by 3–6, 6–2 and 7–5.

He reached the quarterfinals of the ATP 250 in Adelaide, after winning 2 qualifying games and defeating Gael Monfils in the 2nd round of the main draw. At the ATP 500 in Rio de Janeiro, he beat Sebastian Baez, but lost to top 10 Matteo Berrettini in the 2nd round. He made the quarterfinals again in other ATP 250s, in Santiago in February, and in Belgrade in April. \nIn July 2022, Monteiro won his seventh Challenger in Salzburg, beating Norbert Gombos in the final, reaching a career-high of world No. 73 on 11 July 2022 in the ATP rankings.\nHe won his first match at the 2022 US Open defeating Alex Molcan, reaching the second round for the first time at this Major.\nHe reached a new career-high ranking of world No. 61 on 17 October 2022 following his title at the 2022 AON Open Challenger in Genoa, Italy.\n2023: First Masters wins, out of top 150.\nAt his home tournament, the 2023 Rio Open he defeated former No. 3 Dominic Thiem in three sets in the first round for his first win of the season.

Thiago constantly uses his lefty forehand to move his opponents around the court, winning most points with it. Being a left-hander that is more acquainted with clay courts, his style is somewhat similar to one of his idols, Rafael Nadal.\nEven though he trained in clay courts during most of his tennis life, Monteiro's adaptation to hard courts especially was noted by critics in 2016. On these surfaces, Thiago varies his game more, using volleys and slices more than on clay.\nEquipment and endorsements.\nAs of October 2014, Monteiro has been training at Tennis Route Academy, at Rio de Janeiro, where other prominent Brazilian players train, including Marcelo Demoliner and Beatriz Haddad Maia. Lacoste was Thiago's clothing brand until January 2017, when he signed with the Spanish brand Joma. He uses Babolat racquets.

The Brazilian team finished in the 7th position that year.\nAs a senior, Thiago Monteiro was first nominated to play for Brazil in Davis Cup after reaching the No. 2 spot in singles for his country. He played against Belgium in 2016, with Brazil losing the tie 0–4, and returning to the Zonal Group. Thiago was later nominated to play against Ecuador in 2017. He won his two matches, including the final match of the tie (a dead rubber).\nMonteiro was the no.1 singles player for Brazil against a Japanese team who missed most of its top players in a tie to decide a World Group spot for 2018. However, Brazil failed to capitalize on the opportunity, with Monteiro losing both matches.\nBeing the team singles No.1 for a second time, this turn against the Dominican Republic, Monteiro failed to confirm his ranking superiority, losing his second match against No.184 José Hernández-Fernández after winning against Roberto Cid Subervi. Brazil went on to win the tie 3–2, anyway, in the 1st round of the 2018 Davis Cup Americas Zone Group I.\nCurrently, Thiago sports a 7–6 record in Davis Cup matches. He has played only singles matches thus far. "

        "title": "2015 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "Roger Federer's 2015 tennis season began on 4 January 2015 at the 2015 Brisbane International. Federer added a new tactic nicknamed the SABR (\"Sneak Attack by Roger\") to his strategy. Like the prior season, he reached 11 finals. Highlights from this season include winning his 1000th career match in Brisbane, surpassing 9000 aces in Dubai, winning his first red clay court title in almost 6 years at the Istanbul Open, and two major runner-up finishes at both Wimbledon and the US Open. Despite the success, Federer dropped a rank to No. 3, ending the year with 6 titles.\nYear summary.\nAustralian Open and early hard court season.\nBrisbane International.\nFederer opened his season for the second consecutive year in Brisbane after reaching the final in 2014. He defeated John Millman from a set and 1–3 down in his first match. He dropped only one game in a 39-minute victory over James Duckworth, before defeating Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals in under an hour to set up a final against Milos Raonic. He recorded 1000 match win during the tournament.\nAustralian Open.\nFederer entered the first Grand Slam of the year as the second seed. He opened his campaign for his fifth crown at Melbourne Park with wins against Yen-Hsun Lu and Simone Bolelli but was upset in the third round by Andreas Seppi in four sets, his first ever loss against the Italian. This ended his record of reaching at the least the semi-finals of the Australian Open for eleven consecutive years.\nDubai Tennis Championships.\nFederer opened his campaign for the seventh Dubai crown with a straight sets victory over Mikhail Youzhny of Russia and then defeated Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, winning in straight sets after a three-game deficit in the first set. Federer passed through the quarterfinals and semifinals with relative ease, dropping only four games against Richard Gasquet and Borna Ćorić. In the final, Federer defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in two sets. Federer elevated his head-to-head record against Djokovic to 20–17 overall, and 15–13 on hard courts with the straight sets victory. The victory gave Federer a record 7th Dubai crown. He also finished the tournament without dropping a set. During the final match, Federer hit 12 aces and surpassed the 9,000 aces mark in his career total, joining Goran Ivanišević, Ivo Karlović and Andy Roddick as the only players to achieve the mark since aces totals were recorded.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nAs the No. 2 seed, Federer started his quest for a fifth title at the BNP Paribas Open with a victory over Argentinian Diego Schwartzman and avenged his earliest Australian Open defeat against Italian Andreas Seppi by beating him in windy conditions before claiming his 50th milestone win at the event by defeating American Jack Sock in straight sets. He then breezed past Tomáš Berdych in the quarterfinals. He extended his winning streak to 10 matches after battling hard in the semifinals against Milos Raonic and defeated him in straight sets to reach a sixth final in the desert. He lost to Novak Djokovic in the final in three sets.\nSpring clay court season and French Open.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nFederer began his clay season at the Monte-Carlo Masters. He opened up against Jérémy Chardy who had beaten him on clay last year in Rome. However this time Federer beat him in straight sets. He then played Gaël Monfils in the third round and lost in straight sets.\nIstanbul Open.\nFederer next played at the inaugural Istanbul Open. In his opening match he beat Jarkko Nieminen in straight sets, improving his record against Nieminen to 15–0. The win also gave Federer his 200th clay court win. He then defeated Daniel Gimeno-Traver in the quarterfinals in three sets. In the semifinals, he won in three sets again against Diego Schwartzman to advance to the final, continuing his streak of making at least one clay final a season since 2001. He defeated Pablo Cuevas in the final to claim his 85th career title. It was his first title on clay since he won the 2012 Mutua Madrid Open on blue clay and his first on red clay since he won the 2009 French Open.\nMadrid Open.\nFederer next played at the Mutua Madrid Open as the top seed. He lost his opening match to Nick Kyrgios in three tiebreak sets, despite being up a set and a break and squandering two match points.\nItalian Open.\nFederer won his second and third round matches against Pablo Cuevas and Kevin Anderson in straight sets. He cruised through Tomáš Berdych in the quarterfinals and Stan Wawrinka in the semifinals, winning both matches in straight sets after being down a break in the first set. He lost to Novak Djokovic in the final in straight sets.\nFrench Open.\nFederer entered the French Open as the second seed. He beat lucky loser Alejandro Falla in the first round and Marcel Granollers in the second round, before reaching the round of 16 by defeating Damir Dzumhur in straight sets. He next played against Gaël Monfils but the match was interrupted due to darkness, after they split the first two sets. The match continued the next day, with Federer prevailing in four sets. He advanced to his 44th major quarterfinal and 11th at Roland Garros, where he lost in straight sets to his compatriot and eventual champion Stan Wawrinka in straight sets.\nGrass court season and Wimbledon.\nHalle Open.\nDue to the tournament being upgraded to a 500 event, Federer was not given a first round bye. As the top seed and defending champion, Federer beat Philipp Kohlschreiber in the first round in three tight sets after being down 3–5 in the third set tiebreak. During the match, Federer slipped three times in poor conditions. Federer then beat Ernests Gulbis, Florian Mayer, and Ivo Karlović, all in straight sets, to make his 10th Halle final, where he defeated Andreas Seppi to win a record 8th Halle title. By winning he became the third man in the open era to win a tournament eight times after Guillermo Vilas and Rafael Nadal.\nWimbledon.\nFederer entered Wimbledon as the second seed. He beat Damir Dzumhur, Sam Querrey and Sam Groth in the first three rounds, losing just one set (a tiebreaker) against the Australian to reach the second week of the tournament. He easily beat Roberto Bautista-Agut in the fourth round in straight sets to advance to his 13th Wimbledon quarterfinal and 45th overall. In his first match on Court One of the tournament, he beat Gilles Simon in straight sets to advance to his 10th Wimbledon semifinal. He then played a flawless match to defeat Andy Murray in straight sets and advance to his 10th Wimbledon final in a repeat against Novak Djokovic, becoming the first man to reach 10 Grand Slam finals at a single event in the Open Era. However, Federer was unable to sustain his form against Djokovic as he squandered a break in the opening set due to a knee injury and despite a fightback to win the second-set tiebreaker from 3–6 down, he lost the match in 4 sets, committing 35 unforced errors in the process. It marked the first time Federer had lost two back to back finals at Wimbledon, and it again denied him the chance to win a record 18th Grand Slam and a record 8th Wimbledon title to break his shared record of 7 Wimbledon titles with Pete Sampras.\nNorth American hard court season and the US Open.\nCincinnati Masters.\nFederer began his summer hard court season at the Cincinnati Open as the second seed and defending champion. He defeated Roberto Bautista-Agut in the second round in straight sets before crushing Kevin Anderson in the third round to advance to the quarterfinals. He beat Feliciano López in straight sets to set up a semifinal clash against Andy Murray. In the semifinal he beat Murray in two tight sets to advance to the final. In the final, he met world No. 1, Novak Djokovic and defeated him in straight sets to win a record 7th Cincinnati title and also deny Djokovic from achieving a historic Career Golden Masters. The win saw Federer regain the No. 2 ranking. It also marked the second time that Federer did not lose a set or have his serve broken at a Masters 1000, having achieved this record at the same tournament back in 2012. This was also the first time that Federer had beaten the Top 2 players in the world at the same tournament, although this feat hadn't been possible during the years that Federer was ranked in the top 2 himself.\nUS Open.\nFederer entered the US Open as the second seed. He easily beat Leonardo Mayer and Steve Darcis in the first two rounds. He then beat Philipp Kohlschreiber in straight sets to advance to the fourth round where he defeated John Isner in three close sets that included two tiebreaks and finally breaking Isner's serve for the first time in the since the 2013 US Open. He then dominated Richard Gasquet in the quarterfinals to advance to his 38th Major semifinal. Facing Stan Wawrinka, Federer triumphed in straight sets to advance to his 7th US Open final since 2009, where he played against Novak Djokovic for the sixth time this year for the championship. In their 42nd meeting overall, Federer lost to Djokovic in four sets, who once again leveled their rivalry to an even 21–21 head-to-head.\nDavis Cup World Group-Play-offs.\nSwitzerland played against the Netherlands in the play-offs. After Wawrinka won his match in five sets, Federer won his match against Jesse Huta Galung in straight sets to put Switzerland at a 2–0 lead against the Netherlands. He then played with Marco Chiudinelli in the doubles, but the pair lost to Matwé Middelkoop and Thiemo de Bakker in five sets.

Federer won in three sets giving him a record-extending 7th Swiss Indoors championship and his sixth title of the season. This was also his first win over Nadal since the 2012 BNP Paribas Open.\nParis Masters.\nFederer's next tournament was the Paris Masters where he was seeded third. He easily beat Andreas Seppi before losing in the third round to American giant John Isner in three sets without ever losing serve.\nATP World Tour Finals.\nFederer began his fourteenth consecutive year-end championships tournament with a straight sets victory over Tomáš Berdych. He then beat the defending champion, Novak Djokovic in straight sets, handing him his first loss at the year-end championships since 2011.

Florida, the tournament champion, earned the conference's automatic bid to the 2015 NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\nThe tournament has been held every year since 1977, with LSU claiming eleven championships, the most of any school. Original members Georgia and Kentucky along with 1993 addition Arkansas have never won the tournament. This is the eighteenth consecutive year and twentieth overall that the event has been held at Hoover Metropolitan Stadium.\nFormat and seeding.\nThe regular season division winners, LSU and Vanderbilt, claimed the top two seeds respectively and the next ten teams by conference winning percentage, regardless of division, will claim the remaining berths in the tournament. The bottom eight teams played a single-elimination opening round, followed by a double-elimination format until the semifinals, when the format reverted to single elimination through the championship game. This was the third year of this format. Auburn was seeded ninth ahead of South Carolina due of the tiebreaker they obtained by winning a regular season series against the Gamecocks in Columbia.\nAll-Tournament Team.\nThe following players were named to the All-Tournament Team.\nBold is MVP."

There were 30 cyclists from 30 nations, with each nation limited to one competitor. The event was won by Aleksandr Kirichenko of the Soviet Union, the nation's first victory in the men's track time trial. Martin Vinnicombe's silver was Australia's first medal in the event since 1972, while Robert Lechner put West Germany on the podium for the second consecutive Games with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th appearance of the event, which had previously been held in 1896 and every Games since 1928. It would be held every Games until being dropped from the programme after 2004. The returning cyclists from 1980 were silver medalist Curt Harnett of Canada, fourth-place finisher Gene Samuel of Trinidad and Tobago, seventh-place finisher Marcelo Alexandre of Argentina, sixteenth-place finisher Max Leiva of Guatemala, twentieth-place finisher Rosman Alwi of Malaysia, and twenty-second-place finisher Lee Fu-hsiang of Chinese Taipei. The favorite was Australian Martin Vinnicombe, who had won the 1987 world championship after third and second place finishes in 1985 and 1986. Other contestants included Maic Malchow of East Germany, who had set the world record in 1986.\nLiechtenstein and Spain each made their debut in the men's track time trial. France made its 15th appearance, having competed at every appearance of the event. For the first time, Great Britain did not compete.\nCompetition format.\nThe event was a time trial on the track, with each cyclist competing separately to attempt to achieve the fastest time. Each cyclist raced one kilometre from a standing start.\nRecords.\nThe following were the world and Olympic records prior to the competition.\nNo new world or Olympic records were set during the competition."

        "title": "Fast4 Tennis",
        "text": "Fast4 Tennis is a format for playing a tennis match, initiated by Tennis Australia, which leads to a shorter match, by the use of varied rules compared to the traditional rules of tennis.\nWhilst the majority of professional tournaments are still run using the traditional format, there have been some pilots of the format, or its variants, in professional tournaments (e.g. the Hopman Cup and the NextGen tournaments). However the 2018 NextGen tournament, for example, did not use the no-let serve, so was not strictly Fast4.\nThere is significant uptake of the format in some countries (such as the United Kingdom, encouraged by the UK governing body) in lower-level tournaments. The benefits of this include, shorter tournaments (hence less time commitment for players); shorter matches (less wear and tear especially on young players); typically more predictable court usage time. However some criticism exists, including, unpredictability of results in close matches due to the shorter format rules; reduction in on-court time per match (hence less match practice opportunity and effectively increased price per point); the encouragement of this shorter format whilst ignoring valid alternatives which do not have some of the features which are criticised in fast 4 (for example single-set matches, single tie break matches, traditional setting to 4 games).\nFast4 has been described as the tennis equivalent of the Twenty20 format of cricket.\nThe rules are similar to the traditional format, but are specifically targeted at shortening match time, including:-\nWith effect from September 2019, the UK governing body (the LTA) has harmonised to a single short match format for all short matches. It is still calling this Fast4, but has the following differences from the Australian Fast4 format:-\nThe following are retained from the Australian Fast4 format\nHistory.\nTrials of the format began in Melbourne in October 2014, with clubs around Australia trialing it.\nThe first major public match of Fast4 was on January 12, 2015, when Roger Federer and Lleyton Hewitt played in an exhibition match at Qantas Credit Union Arena in Sydney, Federer winning 4–3(5–3), 2–4, 3–4(3–5), 4–0, 4–2. The match was broadcast live nationally in Australia on Nine Network as well as some international networks.\nRafael Nadal also participated in the Fast4 promotion with an exhibition match on January 13, 2015 at Melbourne Park, site of the Australian Open. The match was played inside Hisense Arena. Fernando Verdasco was one of the participants in the exhibition.\nIn December 2016, it was announced that the 2017 Hopman Cup would be the first official tournament to feature the Fast4 format, being applied only in mixed doubles matches.\nIn 2020, amid the suspension of the international tennis season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, world men's no. 1 Novak Djokovic organized a series of exhibition tournaments using the Fast4 format known as the Adria Tour.\nRules.\nFast4 Tennis rules are a modification to the traditional rules of tennis, with the major significant changes as shown below. \nNote that from 1 Sept 2019, the rules are different for UK LTA governed short matches. See the introduction for details of this revised format.\nThe shortened format offers a \"fast\" alternative to tennis, with four points, four games and four rules: there are no advantage scores, lets are played, tie-breakers apply at three games all and the first to four games wins the set.\nSimilar to 12 point tiebreaker but with a few format changes especially on service order. First player to 5 points. Each player serves twice starting in deuce court switching sides after 4 points. At 4-all, a coin toss by the umpire (or racquet spin if none is present) determines who will serve the ninth point with the receiving player choosing sides on the final point.\nThe full explanation of the Fast4 format and rules is available at Tennis Australia.\nControversy.\nThe wide uptake of the Fast4 format in competitive tennis in the UK has led to some criticism of some aspects of the format.\nThis rule means that serves which hit the net and still land in the service box, must be played. This includes serves which hit the net hard, and trickle over, or get significantly slowed by the net contact. This can therefore lead to unplayable serves, sometimes at key points in a match. This approach to lets has also led to confusion when switching between different types of tournament (i.e. the service receiver does not return a legal no-let serve, because in the traditional format this would be treated as a “let”, and re-played).\nOne main argument in favour of no-let serves, is that it eliminates the possibility of cheating by the receiver on the serve, where the receiver claims a valid serve had touched the net.\nWhilst the format will normally result in a balanced result between highly differing standards of player, the use of short sets, sudden death deuce, played lets, and short tie break formats can also lead to a strong element of chance between closely matched players. There is often limited opportunity to recover from a poor start, or a chance event such as a 'Fast4 Ace' (Net cord).\nThere is also a concern that on-court time during tournaments can be reduced due to the shorter format, reducing participation time and effectively increasing the court time cost of tournaments, as some providers are keeping tournament prices and organisation the same for the faster format.\nAlternative shorter formats.\nIn Thirty30 tennis, every game starts at 30–30.\nFast4 is an emerging format, and as can be seen, has a number of variants. Some variants are used to reduce the likelihood of matches being influenced by chance events. these include:-\nThese address some of the features which are criticised in fast 4:-\nHence there is more time to recover from a mistake, dip in form, or chance event.\nExamples include:-"

There were 27 singles title events, three doubles title events, and two team events on the 2015 schedule.\nTournament schedule and recaps.\nFor the seventh year in a row, the PBA held multiple fall North American events in one location, at the GEICO PBA World Series of Bowling VII (WSOB VII). Preliminary rounds and match play took place December 8 through December 14 in Reno, NV, and included four \"animal\" oil pattern events (Cheetah, Viper, Chameleon, and Scorpion). The four pattern tournaments in WSOB VII served as initial qualifying for the PBA World Championship. The top 25% of players in total pinfall (from a field of up to 312 participants) over the 36 games of qualifying (nine games per pattern tournament) moved on to the PBA World Championship cashers round and bowled an additional six games of qualifying on the PBA World Championship oil pattern to determine the top 24. Three additional match play rounds of eight games each determined the field for the five-player stepladder finals, which aired live in primetime on December 17 on ESPN. The finals for the four animal pattern tournaments were taped on December 18, and aired on consecutive Sundays on ESPN, beginning December 20.\nSeveral international tour stops, which are part of the World Bowling Tour (WBT), were again part of the PBA schedule. As in 2014, a PBA title was awarded if any of these stops were won by a PBA member. In addition, some tournaments formerly consigned as PBA Regional tour stops qualified the winner to earn a PBA title. These are designated as \"Xtra Frame\" tournaments because they are broadcast exclusively (start-to-finish) on the PBA's Xtra Frame webcast service.\nReturning to the PBA schedule in 2015 was the U.S. Open major, which was not played in 2014. The BPAA and USBC secured Bowlmor AMF bowling centers as the title sponsor for the 2015 event, which took place November 2–8 in Garland, Texas.\nTournament summary.\nBelow is a schedule of events for the 2015 PBA Tour season. Major tournaments are in bold. Career PBA title numbers for winners are shown in parentheses (#).\n[+] Chris Barnes won an additional ¥5 million ($43,032) for rolling a 300 game in his semifinal match.&lt;br&gt;\n[F] Denotes female competitor. By tournament rules, female competitors receive 8 pins handicap per game in this tournament, and thus cannot be credited with a PBA title."

        "title": "2016 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2016 proceeded according to rules most recently amended in 2015. As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players, with results announced on January 6, 2016; Ken Griffey Jr. and Mike Piazza were elected to the Hall of Fame.\nThe Pre-Integration Era Committee, the last of three new voting committees established during an earlier rules change in 2010 to replace the more broadly defined Veterans Committee, convened in December 2015 to select from a ballot of players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the sport prior to 1947 – called the \"Pre-Integration Era\" by the Hall of Fame – but failed to select any inductees.\nThe Hall of Fame induction ceremonies was held on July 24, 2016, at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, with commissioner Rob Manfred presiding. On the day before the actual induction ceremony, the annual Hall of Fame Awards Presentation took place. At that event, two awards for media excellence were presented – the Hall's Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters and the BBWAA's J. G. Taylor Spink Award for writers. The other major Hall of Fame award, the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award, was not scheduled to be presented again until 2017.\nBBWAA election.\nOn July 26, 2014, the Hall announced changes to the rules for election for recently retired players, reducing the number of years a player will be eligible to be on the ballot from fifteen years to ten. Two candidates presently on the BBWAA ballot (Lee Smith and Alan Trammell) in years 10-15 were grandfathered into this system and retained their previous 15 years of eligibility. In addition, BBWAA members who were otherwise eligible to cast ballots were required to complete a registration form and sign a code of conduct before receiving their ballots, and the Hall will make public the names of all members who cast ballots (but not their individual votes) when it announces the election results. The code of conduct specifically states that the ballot is non-transferable, a direct reaction to Dan Le Batard turning his 2014 Hall of Fame ballot over to the sports website \"Deadspin\" and allowing the site's readers to make his Hall votes (an act that drew him a lifetime ban from future Hall voting). Violation of the code of conduct will result in a lifetime ban from BBWAA voting.\nThe most recent rules change, announced on July 28, 2015, tightened the qualifications for the BBWAA electorate. Beginning with the 2016 election, eligible voters must not only have 10 years of continuous BBWAA membership, but also be currently active members, or have held active status within the 10 years prior to the election. A BBWAA member who has not been active for more than 10 years can regain voting status by covering MLB in the year preceding the election. As a result of the new rule, the vote total in 2016 decreased by 109 from the previous year, to 440.\nThe BBWAA ballot was announced on November 9, 2015; ballots were submitted by December 21, and results were announced on January 6, 2016. The ballot included two categories of players:\nAll BBWAA members with at least 10 years of continuous membership and active membership status at any time in the preceding 10 years were eligible to vote.\nThere were 440 total ballots cast with 3496 individual votes for players, an average of 7.95 players named per ballot.\nAs in most recent elections, the controversy over use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) is likely to dominate the election. \"ESPN.com\" columnist Jim Caple noted in the days before the announcement of the 2012 results that the PED issue and the BBWAA's limit of 10 votes per ballot was likely to result in a major backlog in upcoming elections:\nCaple's predictions about the players on the 2015 ballot, as well as the players he expected to be elected before then, mostly proved accurate. Larkin was indeed elected in 2012, and Maddux, Glavine and Thomas were elected on their first ballot appearance in 2014. The main exceptions were Palmeiro and Williams, who got less than 5% of the vote in prior elections and failed to stay on, and Biggio, who fell short of election in both of his first two years on the ballot, missing out in 2014 by two votes. Biggio was finally elected in 2015.\nAnother \"ESPN.com\" writer, Tim Kurkjian, noted that the 2013 ballot would include several new candidates who either tested positive or were strongly linked to PEDs:\nIn his first year on the ballot, Ken Griffey Jr. received 99.3% of the vote, a BBWAA election record at the time (surpassing the 98.84% of Tom Seaver). Mike Piazza, in his fourth year, finished second at 83.0% and was the only other player elected. Griffey became the first number 1 pick elected to the Hall of Fame, having been selected first overall in the 1987 MLB Draft, while Piazza became the latest pick to be elected having been selected in the 62nd round of the 1988 MLB Draft.\nAlan Trammell and Mark McGwire were on the ballot for their final time. Neither were elected, meaning they will not be eligible for further consideration by the BBWAA. Following a July 2016 rule change, they will be considered eligible for consideration by the Veterans Committees, which has now been split into four eras. In , McGwire appeared on the post-1988 (Today's Game) committee ballot, authorised to consider all MLB figures whose greatest contributions occurred after 1987, with the restriction that the only players that can be considered are those whose BBWAA eligibility has been exhausted. McGwire received fewer than 5 votes. In , Trammell appeared on the Modern Baseball committees ballot, authorised to consider all MLB figures whose greatest contributions occurred from 1970 to 1987, with the restriction that the only players that can be considered are those whose BBWAA eligibility has been exhausted. Trammell was elected, receiving 81.3% of the vote. Other committees include pre-1949 (meeting decennially), 1950-69 (quintennially), and the two biennial committees that will skip when the quintennial and decennial committees vote, the 1980–87 and the aforementioned post-1988.\nResults.\nPlayers who were eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Ronnie Belliard, Eric Byrnes, Frank Catalanotto, Jesús Colomé, Elmer Dessens, Pedro Feliz, José Guillén, Cristian Guzmán, Bob Howry, Gabe Kapler, Mike Lamb, Jason LaRue, Ron Mahay, Dámaso Marte, Gary Matthews Jr., Gil Meche, Brian Moehler, Chad Moeller, Bengie Molina, Russ Ortiz, Chan Ho Park, Jay Payton, Mike Redmond, Juan Rincón, David Riske, Scott Schoeneweis, Scot Shields, Russ Springer, Fernando Tatís, Jeff Weaver and Gregg Zaun.\nPre-Integration Era Committee.\nIn keeping with the voting procedure by eras, the BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview Committee, made up of 11 BBWAA members, identified ten Pre-Integration candidates who were judged to have made their greatest contributions from the origins of the sport to the end of baseball's color line in 1947. This era was previously under consideration in the 2013 election, when three candidates were elected; Bill Dahlen was the only other candidate to receive more than three votes. Along with the era, these rules defined the consideration set:\nHowever, due to the passage of time, the only listed criteria that materially restricted the field from which the candidates were selected were years of service and presence on baseball's ineligible list.\nThe eleven BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview Committee members were Dave Van Dyck (\"Chicago Tribune\"); Bob Elliott (\"Toronto Sun\"); Jim Henneman (formerly \"Baltimore Sun\"); Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau); Rick Hummel (\"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"); Bill Madden (formerly New York \"Daily News\"); Jack O'Connell (BBWAA secretary/treasurer); Jim Reeves (formerly \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\"); Tracy Ringolsby (MLB.com); Glenn Schwarz (formerly \"San Francisco Chronicle\"); and Mark Whicker (Los Angeles News Group). All except Henneman and Reeves were members of the committee that selected the 2013 candidates.\nThe Pre-Integration ballot for election was released on October 5, 2015; final voting was conducted by the Pre-Integration Committee, a 16-member body which met at baseball's winter meetings in Nashville on December 6, with 75% (12 of 16 votes) required for election; results were announced the following morning. The committee's members, appointed by the Hall of Fame's board of directors, were announced later in fall 2015 and included members of the Hall, baseball executives, members of the media and historians:\nBlyleven, Gillick, Niekro, DeWitt, Hughes, Hirdt, Morris, Smith and T.R. Sullivan previously served on the committee which selected the 2013 inductees. For the second consecutive year, none of the candidates received enough votes for election; it marked the third consecutive year – and the fifth time in seven years – in which no former players were chosen by the Hall's special committees. Speaking on MLB Network's \"Hot Stove\" immediately after it broadcast the announcement, Major League Baseball's official historian John Thorn expressed surprise and disappointment at the results, noting that he had felt there were three particularly strong candidates (prior to the announcement, he had commented favorably on the candidacies of Doc Adams and Harry Stovey); he speculated that the number of good candidates may have deadlocked the voting once again, and suggested that the Hall may need to amend the voting process in the future.\nAt the time of the election, figures from this era were scheduled to be considered prior to the 2019 inductions. However, in July 2016, the Hall announced changes to its era-based committee system, replacing the three then-current committees with four new voting bodies. The Pre-Integration Era body was replaced by the newly created Early Baseball committee. The new committee will consider figures whose greatest contributions occurred before 1950 (a slightly broader time frame from its predecessor), but will not hold its first meeting until 2020 as part of the 2021 election process. Most significantly, this committee will meet only once a decade, specifically in years ending in 0.\nThe candidates for election were:\nBreadon, Dahlen, Ferrell, Marion and Walters were previously candidates on the 2013 ballot.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is now given the previous day at the Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum.\nOn December 8, 2015, \"Boston Globe\" columnist Dan Shaughnessy received 185 out of 417 of the votes cast, making him the 2016 recipient of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nThe Ford C. Frick Award, honoring excellence in baseball broadcasting, has been presented at the induction ceremonies since 1978. Through 2010, it had been presented at the main induction ceremony, but is now awarded at the Awards Presentation. Recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized in an exhibit at the museum. To be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two. The honor is based on four criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans.\nThis was the third and final Frick Award selection under a process similar to that instituted for Veterans Committee balloting in 2010. Under this process, candidates were considered every third year, based on the era in which they made their most significant contributions:\nAs part of the rules changes announced in July 2016, the Hall also announced changes to the Frick Award selection process, effective with the 2017 award. While the process will continue to involve three annually rotating voting bodies, the groups of candidates to be considered by each committee have changed. The newly established committees will rotate in the following order: \"Current Major League Markets\" (team-specific broadcasters), \"National Voices\" (national broadcasters), and \"Broadcasting Beginnings\" (early broadcasters). In addition, the number of finalists will be reduced from 10 to 8, and the three ballot slots that had been filled by fan voting on the Hall's Facebook page will now be chosen by a committee of baseball historians.\nTen finalists from the \"Broadcasting Dawn Era\" were announced on October 6, 2015. In accord with the current guidelines, seven were chosen by a Hall of Fame research committee, while the other three were selected (for the final time) from a list of candidates by fan voting at the Hall's Facebook page from September 14 to October 2.\nAll of the candidates were deceased, with the most recently living among them being Laux, who died in November 1978. Heilmann is a Hall of Fame member as a player.\nOn December 9, McNamee was announced as the recipient. The Hall's official announcement called him \"quite possibly the first celebrity sportscaster... renowned as the most recognized personality during radio’s formative years.\" He began his broadcasting career in 1923 with WEAF (now known as WNBC) in New York City, and called 12 World Series, countless other baseball games, and 10 other sports until his death in 1942."

        "title": "Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse",
        "text": "The Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse is a heritage-listed former club house at 309 Herston Road, Herston, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Reyburn Jameson and built in 1931 and extended in 1939 and 1948. It is also known as the Pink Palace, after a nightclub which operated out of the building in the late 1970s and 1980s. The building now serves as offices for the Mental Illness Fellowship of Queensland. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 December 1999.\nHistory.\nThe Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse was constructed in two stages, 1931 and 1939, as the clubhouse for Brisbane's first municipal golf links, established in Victoria Park in 1930–1931.\nThe modern game of golf originated in Scotland in the 18th century. By the late 19th century it was popular throughout Britain, and in the 1880s and 1890s, British immigrants established golf clubs throughout the British Empire.\nGolf was introduced to Queensland in the 1880s by two Scots, Francis Ivory and his brother Alexander, who laid out a six-hole course on their Eidsvold cattle station, near Gayndah. Golf courses at Ravenshoe and Townsville (1893) are the first recorded Queensland courses. The Brisbane Golf Club, formed in 1890, was the first organised golf club in Queensland. It established a course at Chelmer in 1896 and subsequently relocated to Yeerongpilly in 1904. It was a private club, attracted the patronage of Lord Lamington (Governor of Queensland 1896–1901), and until 1920 was the only golf club in Brisbane. The City Golf Club Toowoomba was formed in 1896 with a nine-hole course on Drayton Road and the Ipswich City Golf Club was established in 1897.\nHowever, golfing was not widespread in Queensland by the turn of the century. The game was the preserve of the affluent, with founders and club members mostly from professional and business sectors. High membership fees and the cost of golfing equipment often excluded the less well-to-do from the sport.\nQueensland entered a period of prosperity in the 1920s, which engendered a new enthusiasm for public sport and recreation. Bowling and golfing in particularly became very popular. Many new players were women, who had gained a greater social freedom during World War I, although generally in golf clubs they were admitted as associates rather than as full members.\nSeveral new private golf clubs were established in Brisbane in the 1920s: the Royal Queensland Golf Club at Hamilton in 1920, followed by clubs at Sandgate (1921), Wynnum (1923), Goodna (now Gailes) (1924), Indooroopilly (1926), Oxley (1928) and Nudgee (1929). A round of golf was considered to be eighteen holes but by 1929 there were only three eighteen-hole courses in Brisbane: Brisbane, Royal Queensland and Indooroopilly. The other Brisbane courses were nine-hole courses played twice to achieve the stipulated round.\nIn the 1920s, municipal golf courses were established throughout Australia, enabling broader social access to the game. Successful municipal courses established in Sydney (1920) and Adelaide (1922), which provided the public with affordable facilities and at the same time generated municipal revenue, stimulated moves for the creation of Queensland municipal courses. The Queensland Golfing Association, eager to foster golf in Queensland, first approached the Mayor of Brisbane in 1922 with a proposal for a nine-hole municipal course at Victoria Park. In 1924 the Toowong Town Council investigated the possibility of establishing a municipal course on One Tree Hill (Mt Coot-tha) and Taringa Shire Council also investigated developing a course, but both proposals were abandoned. In 1923 the Ipswich City Council took over the Ipswich Golf Club and established the first municipal course in Queensland, with public play commencing in 1924.\nFollowing the formation of Greater Brisbane in 1925, the Brisbane City Council prioritised the provision of parks and public reserves, and the establishment of sport and recreation facilities within these areas. A large section of Victoria Park – established in York's Hollow in 1865 – had been reserved as the site for a new University of Queensland since , and had lain largely undeveloped. When the university announced in 1926 its decision to build at St Lucia instead, the Queensland Golf Association again raised the issue of establishing municipal golf links at Victoria Park. This time the proposal was greeted with enthusiasm by the council. Both the first Lord Mayor of Greater Brisbane, Alderman William Jolly, and the Town Clerk, Stanley Eldred Travill, were tireless supporters for the establishment and development of the municipal golf course at Victoria Park. Jolly became the inaugural president of the Victoria Park Golf Club and remained in this office until 1934. He was made a life member in 1935 in recognition of his services to the club. The proposal was supported also by Parks Superintendent Harry Moore, who estimated that the cost of developing the land as a park would be £50,000 to £60,000 – far in excess of the cost of establishing a golf links.\nSome delay in implementation was experienced due to the slow process of transferring much of Victoria Park back to the City Council. A course was designed by Stan Francis, who laid plans before the Council in February 1930 and who supervised the laying out. Much of the work on the course was completed under the Intermittent Relief Scheme, and was well in hand by September 1930 when the council put out tenders for the construction of the clubhouse. This building was situated at the northeast corner of the course because it allowed players to return in an easterly direction, as advised by Francis. It was also close to the tram along Bowen Bridge Road, which was convenient for players. The clubhouse was designed in the office of the City Architect, Alfred Herbert Foster, with plans drawn by Assistant Architect Reyburn Jameson. The building was in the Spanish Mission style, popular for recreational interwar buildings such as bathing pavilions and picture theatres, and which had been used in the design of the council's Moora Park Kiosk at Sandgate (erected 1928).\nWork on the clubhouse commenced early in 1931, and it was ready for occupation in September. The links were completed a couple of months later, and the Victoria Park Golf Course was opened officially on 20 November 1931. Final construction cost for the course and clubhouse was £13,919 (course £9,794; clubhouse £4,125).\nTo ensure the successful functioning of the new course, the Victoria Park Golf Club was formed at a public meeting on 20 March 1931, at which it was confirmed that the Council provided the course, clubhouse, the salaries of a Club Secretary and Club Professional, and assumed responsibility for the upkeep of the course, while the Club members were responsible for the operations of the club. Any casual player was entitled to play the course without joining the club, on payment of the appropriate green fees.\nThe Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse boasted every modern facility, but no bar, as many members of the council were not in favour of making alcohol available. There were protests about this lack, both as a facility to members and as a revenue-earner. The Council eventually gave permission for a bar, which was opened on New Year's Day, 1935.\nDuring the depression years of the 1930s many private golf clubs lost membership, but that of the Victoria Park Golf Club doubled between 1933 and 1937. In response to this expansion and to be able to continue to attract membership, the clubhouse was extended and remodelled in 1939 by City Architect, Harold Erwood. Wings were added to either side of the existing building, with the additions and alterations focussing on improved member and associate services and facilities, including new lounge and dining room areas with a timber dance floor upstairs; a doubling of locker space, toilet and shower facilities; private rooms; modern kitchen; independent access for women; and new exterior lighting. The upper floor also provided new living accommodation for the club secretary, in the eastern wing. The layout, incorporating facilities for women in the west wing and those for men in the east wing, reflected a marked social separation between the sexes. The extended building opened on 26 October 1939 and continued in use throughout the Second World War, despite the original 17th and 18th fairways being occupied as a military encampment. The lounge area of the clubhouse was extended in 1948 and the ground floor was refurbished in 1963.\nThe Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse was one of the larger public buildings erected by the Greater Brisbane Council, and the golf links remained the only municipal course in Brisbane until the establishment of the St Lucia Golf Course in 1985. Other civic work produced by the Brisbane City Architect's office during the interwar period included bandstand rotundas, kiosks, dressing sheds and toilet blocks. This work ranged across a number of styles and generally care was given to their design. Tramway substations and the New Farm Powerhouse were designed by engineers in the council's Tramways Department.\nThe course was considered to be one of the finest municipal golf courses in Australia and has been described as the cradle of golf in Brisbane. Under the tutelage of Arthur Everett Gazzard, foundation professional 1931–1972, some players went on to become professional golfers in the Queensland and Australian arenas. In the mid-1970s a new clubhouse was constructed on the brow of the hill between Herston Road and Gilchrist Avenue, and was opened on 14 December 1975. The links were altered so that the ninth and eighteenth holes were near the new clubhouse, changing Francis' orientation of the course. The 1930s clubhouse was vacated at this time.\nIt was tenanted from 1978 by the Lone Parent Club of Queensland, and through the 1980s operated as a disco venue for single parents known as \"The Pink Palace\", named for its then brightly painted facade. It was then abandoned for many years, during which time it was vandalised and inhabited by squatters. In 2009–2010, it was restored by its owners, the Brisbane City Council, in order to serve as office space for the Mental Illness Fellowship of Queensland.\nDescription.\nThe former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse is a large, freestanding, two-storeyed brick building rendered with a rough cast finish, located in the north-east corner of the Victoria Park Golf Course bounded by Gilchrist Avenue and Herston Road, Herston. The main entrance towards Gilchrist Avenue overlooks Victoria Park below and a bitumen carpark occupies the former putting green terrace between the building and the road.\nThe main elevation is symmetrical about a centrally projecting gabled entry porch which was the core of the 1931 building. The 1939 alterations and additions are in the non-identical wings flanking the central bay and the terminating pavilions to the east and west. The building conveys the impression of a Spanish-Mission or Mediterranean character established in the 1931 design but the overall impact is of thoughtful classicism within a restrained use of Spanish references.\nThe three bays of the main entrance porch, now glazed to form an enclosed entry vestibule, are punctuated by square columns with rounded concrete brackets. The balcony above the entrance porch has three round arched openings with decorative concrete balustrade panels. The glazing to these openings was a later addition. A gable vent of curved tiles sits below the low pitched gable roof clad with Marseilles tiles.\nWithin the west loggia, a stairtower sits between the formal entrance and the minor entry porch which has a decorative roof edge capping of round tiles. The upper loggia has two sets of paired open round arches screened with timber blinds.\nAt ground level in each of the end pavilions, a projecting central bay capped with round roof tiles is flanked by pairs of casement windows decorated with wrought-iron window grilles. Slender half columns in a stylised Corinthian order define the corners of the bay and casement windows with a scalloped fringed sill are recessed within the bay. At the upper level of each pavilion a continuous sill wraps around the corners below three generous window bays which in the west wing are filled with sets of casement windows and in the east with louvres. The wings have Marseilles-tiled hipped roofs with bracketed eaves.\nFrom Herston Road the tiled roof and upper level of the building peep through the vegetation around the perimeter of the property. This elevation is asymmetrical about a central gabled bay. Three separate pedestrian bridges cross from Herston Road to the upper level connecting with the latticed porch entrance to the living quarters and the dining room.\nThe south-west and south-east corners continue as wrap-arounds from the main elevation. A plain pilaster with a round tile decorative coping above the capital is located one-third the way along each side elevation and finishes the corner. To the west four bays of metal framed casement windows at the upper level afford views across the Golf Course.\nThe building plan accommodates access and vertical circulation within the loggias to the front of the building and services and storage along the rear. At ground level the pavilions contain the locker/changing areas. The upper level contains the large dining room, ancillary service areas, meeting spaces and the living quarters in the east pavilion.\nFrom the reception vestibule a metal staircase to the right arrives at the upper level loggia. The reception vestibule opens into the main bar area. Evidence suggests that later openings have been made in the wall between the main bar area and the west pavilion. The stair from here arrives at the upper loggia which connects to the dining area. At ground level, the east wing houses a billiard room and toilet/shower facilities. An acoustic tile ceiling has been inserted in the new reception and main bar areas. Plain plaster ceilings are found elsewhere throughout the ground floor. The toilets in the west wing retain original finishes and the former women's shower area has been altered to accommodate male toilets. The men's shower, change and toilet facilities in the east wing remain.\nThe upper floor contains a spacious lounge and dining area, kitchen, bar, storage, meeting room and living quarters. Windows to the west offer an extended view across the Golf Course. The low-ceiling of the dining space is punctuated by plain plaster rendered ceiling beams finished with decorative corbels at the wall junctions. An extensive hardwood dance floor survives. The dining area and the meeting room open to the front balcony and east loggia which offer a fine prospect to the old Exhibition Building, the RNA showgrounds and lower Victoria Park. The living quarters of the east pavilion are accessed from the east loggia and include a bathroom, kitchen, living room, bedroom, storage area, balcony and rear verandah entrance to Herston Road. In contrast to the restrained decoration of the public areas the living quarters has a number of decorative cornices in an Art Deco style.\nSome mature trees from the original landscaped setting remain around the former Clubhouse. A chain wire fence on a tuff base sits on the retaining wall to the rear. Housings in the tuff base suggest that this was formally a timber fence. Concrete steps and a buggy ramp from the tram/bus stop in Herston Road provide smooth access for golfers and buggies from the roadway to the Course. Access from Course to Clubhouse is provided by a similar set of concrete steps and buggy ramp adjacent to the former first tee. A low painted stone wall with two sets of steps to the old Clubhouse forms an edge to the carpark. Approximately half way along the former first fairway a substantial set of stairs arrives on the Course from Gilchrist Avenue. The stairs are of concrete and hammered tuff with a concrete plaque bearing the date 1936.\nHeritage listing.\nThe former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 December 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\nThe former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse, erected in the 1930s, is important for its association with the development of golf as a popular recreational sport in Queensland. The establishment of the Victoria Park Golf Course in 1930–1931 as Brisbane's first municipal golf links, along with the formation of the Victoria Park Golf Club and the construction of a purpose-designed clubhouse, illustrates the Greater Brisbane City Council's strong commitment to the development of public recreational facilities during the interwar period.\nThe former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse is an integral element within an historic precinct situated around York's Hollow and along Bowen Bridge Road between Gregory Terrace and Breakfast Creek, which has been important in the evolution of Brisbane's and Queensland's history. This area includes the residential, ecclesiastic and educational structures along Gregory Terrace overlooking Victoria Park, Bowen Park, an early tram shelter shed adjacent to Bowen Park along Bowen Bridge Road, the RNA Grounds, the former Exhibition Building (Old Museum Building) at the northeast corner of Gregory Terrace and Bowen Bridge Road, the Exhibition Railway, Victoria Park, Centenary Pool Complex, the Electricity Sub-station at the northwest corner of Bowen Bridge Road and Gregory Terrace, Victoria Park Golf Course, the former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse, Royal Brisbane Hospital, and the University of Queensland Mayne Medical School.\nThe place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.\nIt is both a good example of Brisbane City Council civic architecture of the period, and a rare interwar recreational building designed and constructed by the Brisbane City Council.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.\nThe former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse is a substantial interwar civic building in Brisbane. It is both a good example of Brisbane City Council civic architecture of the period, and a rare interwar recreational building designed and constructed by the Brisbane City Council. In its Spanish Mission references, the building embodies the then popular association of this style – often employed in designs for picture theatres and bathing pavilions – with recreational activity. The more formal neo-Georgian 1939 extensions are mindful of its civic presence, reflecting the success of the municipal golf links as a Council venture in the 1930s.\nThe former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an interwar clubhouse, accommodating the principal elements necessary to the successful functioning of a golf clubhouse of this era, including locker and associated ablutions areas for members and associates, segregated by gender; a separate entrance and lounge area for female players; an administrative station; living quarters for the Club Secretary; and clear physical and visual links with the golf course proper. The building retains clear evidence of the 1939 gender segregation in the arrangement of internal spaces and circulation patterns.\nThe place is important because of its aesthetic significance.\nDespite having lost much of its park setting, the building retains an aesthetic value: the exotic suggestion of the Spanish Mission references, tempered by the neo-Georgian restraint, combine to create a robust, elegant sports pavilion.\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\nThe place has social significance for its close association with the popularisation of golfing in Brisbane and in Queensland for over four decades. It also has one of the last large timber dance floors in Brisbane, and has been associated with Brisbane social functions such as balls, dinners, and receptions for many decades."

        "text": "The Atlantic City Seagulls were a professional basketball team based in Atlantic City, New Jersey. They played 6 seasons in the United States Basketball League (USBL), winning 3 consecutive league titles between 1997 and 1999.\nHistory.\nThe franchise was founded in early 1996 by a group of investors led by Philadelphia native Paul Lipschutz. The first coach was Mike Gatley. In their inaugural season, the team won the Northern Division title with a 22–7 record and reached the league finals, after defeating Connecticut Skyhawks in the quarterfinals and the Tampa Bay Windjammers in the semifinals; the Seagulls lost to the Florida Sharks in the USBL finals, 115–118. Former McDonald's All-American and Syracuse guard Michael Lloyd won the USBL Rookie of the Year award, and three players were named to all-league teams (Greg Grant to the All-USBL First Team and Mark Strickland and Ron Anderson to the Second Team).\nIn April 1997 the Seagulls signed R&amp;B singer R. Kelly to a professional basketball contract. The team ended the regular season with the best record in the league (20–6, .769), won their second division title in a row, and again reached the USBL finals, defeating the Philadelphia Power in the quarterfinals and the Raleigh Cougars in the semifinals. Facing the Long Island Surf in the USBL finals, the Seagulls won the game, 114–112, and obtained their first USBL title. The team could count on the league's top rebounder, Brent Scott, and the season assists leader Mark Baker: Scott and Baker were named Postseason co-MVPs, while coach Kevin Mackey received the Coach of the Year award.\nIn 1998 the Seagulls were moved to the newly created Mid-Atlantic Division: they finished the season with an 18–8 record (second in the league behind the Long Island Surf's 18–7) and qualified for the playoffs for the third consecutive season. In the second round the team defeated the Atlanta Trojans, 118–107, and in the Final Four they beat the Jacksonville Barracudas, 122–107. For the second season in a row, the Seagulls beat the Long Island Surf in the league finals (100–96) and won the USBL title. Adrian Griffin won the Postseason MVP award.\nIn 1999 the team won the Mid-Atlantic Division title again with a 23–6 record, the best in the league and also the best in franchise history (.793). They reached the finals after defeating the Tampa Bay Windjammers in the quarterfinals and the Pennsylvania Valleydawgs in the semifinals; in the USBL finals they beat the Connecticut Skyhawks, 83–77, and obtained their third consecutive championship. Adrian Griffin won both the Player of the Year and the Postseason MVP awards, while Kevin Mackey was named the league's Coach of the Year and Lloyd led the league in scoring at 27.3 points per game.\nIn 2000, the Seagulls' performance dropped: they were assigned to the Northern Division, and they ended with a 12–18 record, the first losing record in their history, and barely qualified for the postseason, where they lost to the Dodge City Legend, 107–122. In 2001 the team lost all 28 games and had the worst record in the history of league, finishing at the last spot of the Northern Division: on that same year, the team was disbanded. In their last season, the Seagulls had averaged less than 100 fans in attendance."

        "title": "IQA World Cup",
        "text": "The IQA World Cup is an international quidditch tournament contested by the national teams of the members of the International Quidditch Association, the sport's global governing organisation. The championship, which was named Summer Games and Global Games in its first two editions, has been awarded every two years since 2012. The current champions are the United States, who defeated Germany in 2023, after having also beaten Belgium back in 2018.\nHistory.\nThe World Cup was first held in July 2012. The tournament was named the \"Summer Games\" in accordance with its unofficial tie-in to the 2012 Summer Olympics, and because the name \"World Cup\" was already being used since 2007 for a club championship held in the United States. The tournament was held in Oxford, United Kingdom as the Olympic torch was passing through the city. Five teams participated: Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The event followed a round-robin format, with the lowest ranked team being eliminated and the others advancing to the bracket phase. The UK was defeated by all other competitors and did not make the bracket. The US took first place, defeating France in the final, and Australia claimed bronze by defeating Canada.\nIn 2014, the tournament was renamed \"Global Games\" and took place under an updated IQA which became an international sports federation. The Games were under the supervision of US Quidditch but were held in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. Seven teams came out to compete: Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Italy had planned to compete but had to pull out. The event was contested over a round-robin, with positions in a series of playoffs determined by each team's result in the first round. Due to limited media relations and improper planning, the tournament was relatively unknown and had a lacking medical staff which became evident when Belgium chose to forfeit after suffering multiple injuries. The United States defended their title by defeating Australia in the final, and Canada claimed bronze by defeating the United Kingdom.\nThe 2016 World Cup took place in Frankfurt, Germany. The initial tournament plan involved 24 competing teams, but because of the dropouts of five teams, the number of expected nations was reduced to 19. Later, Brazil and Slovakia were added to the roster of teams, resulting in a field of 21 nations. The tournament took place using a pool-play format, followed by a single-elimination bracket with all 21 teams. Ahead of the tournament, exhibition matches were held between Canada and the United Kingdom, Turkey and Mexico and Australia and Germany. After a pool-play and bracket tournament, Australia defeated the United States 150*–130 in the final. The United States had first made a snitch catch which was disallowed on the grounds of charging the snitch. When the Australian seeker caught the snitch, the catch was initially challenged due to the seeker having been hit by a bludger. However the beat was ruled out as the beater had himself been hit by a bludger. The catch was therefore called good and Australia won the match and the United States suffered their first defeat. In the third place match, the United Kingdom avenged their defeat in the 2014 third place playoff years prior by beating Canada 190*–60. Both the final and bronze playoff were therefore re-runs of the same games from the previous World Cup, both with the reverse result.\nThe 2018 World Cup was held in Florence, Italy with 29 teams competing. There has been much online controversy about the unexpected hike in tournament fees, which has forced some smaller nations to drop out, namely Denmark and Sweden, both of whom would have been attending for the first time.\nFormat.\nQualification.\nNone of the competitions so far have involved a qualification round. To be eligible, the team must be representing a region's national governing body.\nResults.\nThe following table shows a list of all World Cups to date. The team that caught the snitch is denoted with an asterisk. "

        "text": "The Memphis Open was a professional tennis tournament that ran from 1975 to 2017. From 1977 onwards, the event was held at the Racquet Club of Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee. The Memphis Open was the only ATP event in the United States which was played on indoor hard courts; it usually took place in February. For part of its history it was a combined men's and women's tournament, but for its final four years it was solely a men's tournament.\nThe event was previously known under various sponsored names including the \"Regions Morgan Keegan Championships\", the \"Kroger St. Jude Championship\", the \"Volvo Championships\", the \"Cellular South Cup,\" and the \"Federal Express International\" and was for a period time part of the now defunct \"U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships\".\nThe last singles champion of the Memphis Open was Ryan Harrison and the last doubles champions are Brian Baker and Nikola Mektić. The 2017 Memphis Open titles were the first career titles for all three men. As of 2018, the tournament has moved to New York as the new New York Open.\nHistory.\nIn 1974, Memphis cotton merchant William B. \"Billy\" Dunavant Jr. purchased the Memphis Athletic Club and began a $7 M expansion to transform the facility into what is now the Racquet Club of Memphis. What is now known as the Memphis Open was first played in 1975 on indoor carpet as part of the WCT. In 1977, the U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships moved to Memphis from Salisbury, Maryland and increased the event's prize money to $220,000. The Memphis Open had the distinction (until 2014) of being the only private indoor racquet club in the world to host a men's and women's professional tennis event. The tournament was played on indoor carpet into the 1980s, but the club eventually changed its surface to hard courts.\nIn November 2001, the Racquet Club of Memphis purchased the rights to the WTA event in Oklahoma City and moved it to Memphis, where the tournament hosted both men's and women's events for 12 years. In 2008, the event was elevated to ATP 500 Series status. In 2014, the men's and women's events moved to Rio de Janeiro. Memphis then purchased the ATP 250 event in San Jose to keep professional tennis in the city. In late 2014, Tennis Rendezvous LLC, owned by the USTA and Golden Set Holdings LLC, purchased the U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships and renamed it the Memphis Open. In 2015, the Memphis Open was sold again, purchased by New York-based financial management company GF Capital.\nOver the years, the Memphis Open has counted nine ATP year-end No. 1 players among its winners: Bjorn Borg, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Stefan Edberg, Andre Agassi, Ivan Lendl, Jim Courier, Pete Sampras, and Andy Roddick. In 2016, Kei Nishikori won the event for a fourth consecutive time, tying Connors' record for the most overall Memphis titles.\nIn April 2017 the ATP announced that the tournament will relocate to the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Long Island, New York in 2018 after the event failed to find a title sponsor in Memphis."

Despite pressure to switch to a hard court surface from the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and some leading players, in line with the surface change made that year by the US Open which directly followed the Boston event, the tournament organization elected to remain a clay court tournament in 1978. Several top players including Björn Borg, Guillermo Vilas and Jimmy Connors elected not to play the tournament. Fourth-seeded and defending champion Manuel Orantes won the singles title and the accompanying $32,000 first-prize money. The final was delayed until Tuesday, August 29 due to rain.\nFinals.\nSingles.\n Manuel Orantes defeated Harold Solomon 6–4, 6–3\nDoubles.\n Balázs Taróczy / Víctor Pecci defeated Heinz Günthardt / Van Winitsky 6–3, 3–6, 6–1"

        "text": "The 2015 Rafael Nadal tennis season officially began on 5 January 2015 with the start of the 2015 Qatar Open.\nYear in detail.\nAustralian Open Series.\nQatar Open.\nNadal began the year as the defending champion at the Qatar Open. However, he lost in the first round, suffering a shocking three set defeat to world number 127 Michael Berrer. He won the doubles title with Juan Mónaco.\nAustralian Open.\nNadal opened his 2015 Australian Open by defeating Mikhail Youzhny in straight sets. In the second round, he prevailed in a tough five-setter against American Tim Smyczek, despite being visibly unwell at times during the match. He then beat Dudi Sela and Kevin Anderson in straight sets to advance to his 28th career Grand Slam quarterfinal. He was defeated there by Tomáš Berdych, thus ending his 17-match win streak against the Czech. This resulted in Berdych becoming only the second player to defeat all four members of the Big Four at a Grand Slam, after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.\nSouth American clay court season.\nRio Open.\nNadal reached the semifinals of the Rio Open after defeating Thomaz Bellucci, Pablo Carreño Busta and Pablo Cuevas. However, he lost to Fabio Fognini in three sets in the semifinals, despite winning the first set and being a break up in the second. This was the first loss in his career against the Italian.\nArgentina Open.\nNadal played in the ATP Buenos Aires tournament, in Argentina, reaching the final without losing a set. He won his first singles title of 2015 and his 46th career clay-court title with a straight-sets victory over Juan Mónaco.\nThe March Masters.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nNadal reached the quarterfinals of the Indian Wells Masters after beating his first three opponents in straight sets. However, his run was ended by Milos Raonic who beat him in three tight sets after Nadal squandered three match points in the second set tiebreak.\nMiami Open.\nHe next competed at the Miami Open, hoping to reach the final for the fifth time and win the tournament for the first time. He had a bye in the first round and proceeded by beating Nicolás Almagro in straight sets but he lost to Fernando Verdasco in the next round in three sets, failing to reach the fourth round of the Miami Open for the first time since 2006 (absent in 2013).\nEuropean clay court season.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nNadal began his favourite part of the season in the clay courts of Monte-Carlo. After a first round bye, he defeated Lucas Pouille in a straight sets match before working hard to pass through big-serving John Isner in three tough sets to book his quarterfinal spot. He defeated David Ferrer in another tight, three set match to proceed to the semifinals, and record his first win over a top 10 player since the final of the 2014 French Open. However, he was defeated by world No.1 Novak Djokovic in the semifinals in straight sets.\nBarcelona Open.\nNadal received a bye in the first round of the 2015 Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell and faced Nicolás Almagro in the second round, completing his revenge for his only loss in Barcelona last year to him by beating him in straight sets. However, he was upset by Fabio Fognini in the next round in straight sets for the second time in the year. The loss made Fognini become the fifth man to beat Nadal on clay more than once after Gastón Gaudio, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, and David Ferrer. He also became the second man to beat Nadal on clay twice in a row in the same year after Djokovic in 2011.\nMadrid Open.\nAfter a first round bye, Nadal had wins over Steve Johnson and Simone Bolelli, each in two sets. He faced Grigor Dimitrov in the quarterfinals and also dispatched him in straight sets. In the semifinals, Nadal had a two set win over Tomáš Berdych to reach his seventh Madrid Open final and 41st Masters 1000 final. He lost to Andy Murray in the final in straight sets. The loss saw Nadal drop out of the Top 5 for the first time since 2005, falling to No. 7.\nItalian Open.\nNadal was granted a first round bye and faced qualifier Marsel İlhan, dominating him in straight sets. He next faced the big-serving John Isner again in the third round and defeated him in straight sets to advance to the quarterfinals. He was taken down by Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals in straight sets, squandering a 6–2 lead in the first set tiebreak and four set points, marking the first time since 2008 that he did not reach the final at the tournament. This also marked the first time since 2004 that Nadal failed to win a single European clay court title before the French Open.\nFrench Open.\nNadal opened his campaign for a 10th French Open title by facing off against wildcard Quentin Halys, beating him in straight sets. He then defeated compatriot Nicolás Almagro and Andrey Kuznetsov, again both in straight sets. In the fourth round he defeated Jack Sock in four sets, but eventually lost to Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. The loss ended Nadal's 5 year winning streak at Roland Garros and was just his second loss ever at the tournament. This loss also marked the first time since 2004 that Nadal failed to win at least one of the first two Grand Slam events of the season. As a result, his ranking dropped to No. 10 in the ATP singles ranking, his lowest ranking since April 2005.\nThe grass season.\nStuttgart Open.\nNadal opened his grass-court season campaign by participating in the Stuttgart Open and survived his first match against Marcos Baghdatis by beating him in three tight sets. He next faces Bernard Tomic and booked his semifinal spot by beating him in another three tight sets. Nadal reached his first grass-court tournament final since reaching the 2011 Wimbledon final by beating Gaël Monfils in straight sets. Nadal won his third Stuttgart title and first grass-court title for the first time since winning the 2010 Wimbledon Championships by beating Viktor Troicki in straight sets in the final. It was only his 2nd title of 2015.\nQueen's Club Championships.\nNadal played at the Queen's Club for the first time since 2011 as the fifth seed. He was knocked out in the first round by Alexandr Dolgopolov, who had previously beaten him at the 2014 BNP Paribas Open.\nWimbledon.\nNadal played at the 2015 Wimbledon as tenth seed. After beating Thomaz Bellucci in the first round in straight sets, he was eliminated in the second round in four sets by Dustin Brown. By winning, Brown became the first ever qualifier to ever beat Nadal at a Grand Slam.\nUS Open Series.\nGerman Open.\nNadal decided to participate in the German Open for the first time since he defeated Roger Federer in the 2008 final in this tournament. He faced a tough opponent, Fernando Verdasco, in the first round but managed to defeat him in three sets. He next faced Jiří Veselý and easily dispatched him in straight sets followed by another straightforward quarterfinal victory against Pablo Cuevas to set a semifinal encounter with Andreas Seppi, which he won again in straight sets. Nadal extended his streak of winning at least one European clay-court title every year since winning in 2004 by beating Fabio Fognini in the Hamburg final in straight sets.\nCanadian Open.\nNadal opened his hard-court season campaign in Canada where he had won the title 3 times. He faced Sergiy Stakhovsky as his first opponent and defeated him in straight sets. He beat Mikhail Youzhny in the third round and advanced to QF, where he lost to Kei Nishikori in straight sets. This marked the first time in eight meetings that he lost a match against the Japanese player.\nCincinnati Masters.\nNadal participated in the Cincinnati Masters the following week, hoping to repeat his 2013 feat by winning this tournament. He opened his campaign against Frenchman Jérémy Chardy and successfully defeated the Rogers Cup semi-finalist in straight sets to book his third round clash with compatriot Feliciano López, which he lost in three sets.\nUS Open.\nIn the final major of the season, Nadal once again faced Fognini, and again was defeated by the player from Italy, losing in the third round. In that match, Nadal won the first two sets, and previously had been 151–0 in Grand Slam matches that he led two sets to love(0). However, Fognini still defeated Nadal in five sets. The upset loss ended Nadal's record 10-year streak of winning at least one major, and leaving him one year short of the record 11-year streak of reaching at least one major final (shared by Lendl and Sampras). This remained the only time he had lost a Grand Slam tournament singles match after starting with a 2-0 lead until the quarterfinals of the 2021 Australian Open where he lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas.\nAsian Fall &amp; Indoor Hard Court Season.\nDavis Cup.\nNadal and many of his Spanish compatriots made a comeback to the Spanish Davis Cup team after the captain of the Spanish Davis Cup team, Gala Leon, was fired due to several critics and rebellions from the Spanish tennis players like Nadal and Ferrer. Spain was now at the Europe Africa Zone due to several consecutive losses. Spain meets Denmark in the 1st round play-offs and easily defeated Denmark with a dominant 5–0 score with Rafa winning in both doubles and singles. He won against Mikael Torpegaard in straight sets.\nChina Open.\nNadal started the Asian Fall by participating in the China Open where he managed to reach the quarterfinals after beating home hope Wu Di and Vasek Pospisil both in straight sets. He survived a quarterfinal test against Jack Sock after comebacking from a set down to set a fifth meeting this year with his nemesis Fabio Fognini. He succeeded in exacting revenge against Fognini by beating him in straight sets to reach his first hard-court tournament final for more than a year. Nadal lost to World No.1 Novak Djokovic in the final 2-6, 2-6.\nShanghai Masters.\nNadal received a first round bye into this ATP Masters 1000 event and faced Ivo Karlović in the second round. Nadal won the first set 7-5 after initially trailing 3-5 but Karlovic forced the second set to a decider which he won 6-7(4). After 2 hours and 44 minutes, Nadal prevailed in the third and final set decider 7-6(4) and won the match. Nadal then avenged his Indian Wells quarterfinals lost against Milos Raonic by beating him in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals. He defeated World No.4 and 2015 French Open Champion Stan Wawrinka in straight sets to reach his first semifinal of a Masters 1000 hard-court tournament in more than a year and with this win, Nadal qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals. Despite sporting an 8-3 head-to-head winning record against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Nadal fell to the Frenchman in the semi-finals in three sets 4–6, 6–0, 5–7.\nSwiss Indoors.\nNadal participated in the Swiss Indoors ATP 500 at Basel and survived a scare in the first round against Lukáš Rosol by beating him in a comeback three-setter where Rosol was 2 points away from winning at the 2nd set at 5-4 on his own serve. In Nadal's next match against Grigor Dimitrov, Rafa battled back from a break down in the final set to defeat Dimitrov 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 to reach the Swiss Indoors quarter-finals. Nadal came back from a set and a break down to surpass big-serving Croatian Marin Čilić in three sets. Nadal reached the second final in a hard-court tournament of the season when he beat Frenchman Richard Gasquet in straight sets to set his first meeting for almost 2 years with long-time rival Roger Federer. However, in his first final at the Swiss Indoor, Nadal lost 3-6, 7-5, 3-6 to Federer.\nParis Masters.\nNadal, seeded 7th, received a bye into the Round of 32 of the Paris Masters in Paris, France. Rafa rolled into the Round of 16 with a 6-2, 6-2 win, his 2nd in back-to-back weeks, over Lukáš Rosol, the 66th-ranked Czech, in just over an hour. Nadal then took on the big hitting South African Kevin Anderson and made another comeback from a set down and 5-6 down in the second set tie-break, saving a match point and closing out the match by breaking twice in the third set. Nadal faced world No.4 Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals and despite pushing both sets to a tiebreaker, Rafa lost the match 6–7(8–10), 6–7(7–9).\nATP World Tour Finals.\nRafael Nadal was seeded fifth in the 2015 ATP World Tour Finals in London and was drawn in the Ilie Năstase Group alongside Andy Murray, David Ferrer and Stan Wawrinka.

        "title": "SummerSlam (2015)",
        "text": "The 2015 SummerSlam was the 28th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It took place on August 23, 2015, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York and would be the first of four consecutive SummerSlam events to take place at the arena. It was the first SummerSlam since 2008 to be held outside of Los Angeles as its Staples Center was the exclusive home for SummerSlam from 2009 to 2014. It was also the eighth SummerSlam to be held in the New York metropolitan area. The Izod Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey was originally supposed to host SummerSlam, but due to its closure in April 2015, the event was relocated. It was also the first SummerSlam to be four hours in length, a length previously reserved only for WrestleMania. This was also the last SummerSlam held before the reintroduction of the brand extension in July 2016. It was also the first major WWE event following the death of Roddy Piper.\nThe event was the second night of what was billed as a \"triple-header\" at the Barclays Center, with having taken place the previous night, and \"Raw\" the following night. Ten matches were contested at the event, with no match on the pre-show. In the main event, The Undertaker defeated Brock Lesnar in controversial fashion; Lesnar put Undertaker in his Kimura lock and the timekeeper rang the bell after seeing the Undertaker tap out, but since the referee did not see Undertaker submit, the match continued. The confusion allowed Undertaker to surprise Lesnar with a low blow before trapping him in the Hell's Gate submission hold, which caused Lesnar to pass out, giving Undertaker the win.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual professional wrestling event produced every August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. Announced on October 13, 2014, the 2015 event was the 28th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 23, 2015, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. In addition to airing on PPV, the event was available to livestream on the WWE Network.\nThe Izod Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey was originally supposed to host SummerSlam (which would have been the fourth SummerSlam held at this venue after the 1989, 1997, and 2007 events), but due to its closure in April 2015, the event was moved to the Barclays Center. Tickets went on sale on March 14 through Ticketmaster. Additionally, WWE increased SummerSlam's length to four hours, a length previously reserved only for WrestleMania. The event was also scheduled as the second night of what WWE billed as a \"triple-header\" at the Barclays Center, with having taken place the previous night, and \"Raw\" the following night.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised 10 matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nAt WrestleMania XXX in 2014, Brock Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to end his undefeated WrestleMania streak. Four months later, Lesnar defeated John Cena at SummerSlam to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, but lost it the following year at WrestleMania 31 in his match against Roman Reigns when Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and won the championship. Lesnar received his rematch against Rollins at Battleground, and was closing in on the win when The Undertaker returned and attacked Lesnar, causing Lesnar to win by disqualification, but not win the championship. The following night, a rematch between Lesnar and Undertaker was scheduled for SummerSlam. This would be Undertaker's first SummerSlam match since 2008, and his first pay-per-view match outside of WrestleMania since Bragging Rights in 2010.\nRyback won the Intercontinental Championship in an Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber. On the June 1 episode of \"Raw\", Ryback was scheduled to make his first title defense against The Miz, but Big Show attacked The Miz, preventing the match from occurring, and confronted Ryback. At Money in the Bank, Big Show defeated Ryback by disqualification after Miz attacked him; therefore, Ryback retained the championship. On June 22, Ryback was scheduled to defend the title against Big Show and Miz in a triple threat match at Battleground, but after Ryback sustained an injury, the match was postponed and, on August 6, rescheduled for SummerSlam.\nAt Money in the Bank, Bray Wyatt attacked Roman Reigns during the Money in the Bank ladder match, preventing him from winning the match. At Battleground, Wyatt defeated Reigns after Luke Harper interfered and attacked Reigns, reuniting The Wyatt Family with Wyatt in the process.

On the July 13 episode of \"Raw\", Stardust defeated Neville. On the August 10 episode of \"Raw\", where Amell was again a special guest, Neville defeated King Barrett, but was then attacked by Stardust. Stardust then assaulted Amell, who entered the ring and attacked Stardust in return. Amell and Neville then persuaded Triple H backstage to make a tag team match at SummerSlam, with Amell and Neville facing Stardust and Barrett.\nOn the July 20 episode of \"Raw\", United States Champion John Cena challenged WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins to a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match, but Rollins refused. On the July 27 episode of \"Raw\", Cena again challenged Rollins, but The Authority instead forced him to defend the United States Championship against Rollins. Cena defeated Rollins, but sustained a broken nose during the match. On the August 3 episode of \"Raw\", Rollins challenged Cena to a \"Winner Takes All\" match at SummerSlam, for both the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and the United States Championship.

Sheamus then attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank contract on Rollins, but was stopped by Orton. On August 17, a match between Orton and Sheamus was scheduled for SummerSlam.\nOn the May 18 episode of \"Raw\", Lana ended her association with Rusev and started a relationship with Dolph Ziggler, turning face in the process (storyline). After making numerous unsuccessful attempts to sway Lana from Ziggler, Rusev started a relationship with Summer Rae (storyline). On the July 6 episode of \"Raw\", Rusev attacked Ziggler, resulting in Ziggler sustaining a throat injury. On the August 17 episode of \"Raw\", Ziggler returned and attacked Rusev. The same night, Ziggler was set to wrestle Rusev at SummerSlam.\nOn the August 17 episode of \"Raw\", Jon Stewart was announced as the special guest host for the event.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nIn the first match, Randy Orton faced Sheamus. The match ended when Orton attempted an \"RKO\" on Sheamus, however, Sheamus countered and executed two \"Brogue Kicks\" on Orton to win the match.\nNext, The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil) defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston), The Lucha Dragons (Kalisto and Sin Cara), and Los Matadores (Diego and Fernando) in a fatal four-way tag team match. The ending saw O'Neil executed the \"Clash of the Titus\" on Fernando but Big E pulled O'Neil out of the ring. Kingston pinned Fernando to win the titles.\nAfter that, Dolph Ziggler faced Rusev. In the climax, Rusev applied the \"Accolade\" on Ziggler but Lana attacked Summer Rae, distracting Rusev. Ziggler performed a Superkick on Rusev, knocking him onto a broadcast table. The match ended in a double countout.\nIn the fourth match, Stephen Amell and Neville faced Stardust and King Barrett. Neville executed a \"Red Arrow\" on Barrett to win the match.\nThe next match was a triple threat match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship between Big Show, The Miz, and defending champion Ryback. The end came when Big Show executed a \"KO Punch\" on Miz but Ryback knocked Big Show out of the ring with a Clothesline. Ryback pinned Miz to retain the title.\nIn the sixth match, Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose faced The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper). As Wyatt attempted \"Sister Abigail\" on Ambrose, Ambrose countered and executed \"Dirty Deeds\" on Wyatt. Reigns executed a Spear on Wyatt to win the match.\nThe seventh match was a Winner Takes All match for both the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and the WWE United States Championship between WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins and United States Champion John Cena. Cena executed an \"Attitude Adjustment\" on Rollins for a near-fall. Rollins executed an \"Attitude Adjustment\" on Cena for a near-fall. As Rollins attempted a \"Pedigree,\" Cena countered and applied the Figure Four Leglock on Rollins. Rollins countered but Cena reached the ropes, forcing Rollins to break the hold. Cena executed a second \"Attitude Adjustment\", but in the process, Rollins inadvertently kicked the referee. Jon Stewart, the host of SummerSlam, ran to the ring with a chair, assumingly helping Cena but struck Cena with the chair. Rollins took advantage and executed a \"Pedigree\" on Cena on the chair. Rollins then pinned Cena to win the match.\nThe next match was a three-team elimination match between The Bella Twins (Divas Champion Nikki Bella, Brie Bella, and Alicia Fox), Team B.A.D.

Lynch pinned Brie after a Pumphandle Uranage to win the match for Team PCB.\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Cesaro. Owens executed a Pop Up Powerbomb on Cesaro to win the match.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Brock Lesnar (with Paul Heyman) faced The Undertaker. During the match, Undertaker attempted a Chokeslam on Lesnar but Lesnar countered the attempt and executed three German Suplexes. Lesnar executed an \"F-5\" through a broadcast table on Undertaker. Undertaker executed a Chokeslam and a \"Tombstone Piledriver\" on Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar applied a \"Kimura lock\" on Undertaker but Undertaker touched the ropes, forcing Lesnar to break the hold. Undertaker performed a \"Last Ride\" on Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar executed two \"F-5s\" on Undertaker, both for near-falls. In the climax of the match, Undertaker applied \"Hell's Gate\" on Lesnar, who countered the move and put Undertaker in another \"Kimura Lock\". At that time, the timekeeper rang the bell after seeing the Undertaker supposedly indicating submission; since the referee hadn't seen a submission and never stopped the match, the match continued. Thinking himself the winner, Lesnar released the hold. Whilst the referee argued with the timekeeper, Undertaker surprised Lesnar with a low blow and applied \"Hell's Gate\" again; Lesnar refused to submit, giving Undertaker the middle finger before passing out to give Undertaker the win. After the match, Heyman rang the timekeeper's bell and declared Lesnar the winner.\nReception.\nThe event received positive reviews, with much of the criticism going to the endings of the \"Winner Take All\" and the Undertaker/Brock Lesnar matches. Will Purett from \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\" said the two main matches had bad endings. Purett was \"infuriated by the finish in Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar\" because \"wrestling finishes in 2015 based on incompetent refereeing are bad ideas.\" Also, he criticized the idea of the Undertaker as the first man who defeated Lesnar in a singles match since WrestleMania 29, saying that \"The Streak, [...] was sacrificed for a retirement tour\". Jason Powell of \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\" praised the Cena vs. Rollins and the Undertaker vs. Lesnar, but likewise criticized both finishes.\nBenjamin Tucker of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" attended in person both WWE SummerSlam and (a day earlier in the same venue). He gave TakeOver a 9.0 score, noting that it was \"met with near-universal praise\", higher than SummerSlam, which rated 6.5 and \"was met with ridicule and scorn by the night's end\". Tucker criticized SummerSlam in comparison to TakeOver, saying that \"the main show writing could learn something from NXT, not WCW 2000\", because \"NXT provided simple stories, but they were easy to follow and made the viewer root for the good guys to prevail\", in addition to \"no chicanery\". Yet SummerSlam had convoluted stories, \"confusingly-presented characters\" and \"terrible\" swerves. Tucker also felt that none of the SummerSlam matches reached the level of the NXT Women's Championship match the night before, \"but the main event was wrestled well, as was Owens-Cesaro, Sheamus-Orton, Rollins-Cena (the probable match of the night)\".\nAftermath.\nAfter winning the WWE United States Championship and retaining the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against John Cena, Seth Rollins was confronted and attacked on the following night's \"Raw\" by a returning Sting, who grabbed the WWE World Heavyweight Championship belt, signaling a challenge for the title. The match was set for Night of Champions. Jon Stewart also revealed that he had interfered on behalf of Rollins in order to prevent Cena from tying Ric Flair's record of World championships, who Stewart is a huge fan of. Stewart was confronted by Flair, who told him that he doesn't mind having his record tied or broken by someone who he respects, and John Cena hit Stewart with an Attitude Adjustment before leaving. A rematch for the United States Championship was granted by The Authority as they stated that all championship titles will be on the line, forcing Rollins to defend both titles back-to-back at Night of Champions.\nFollowing the controversial loss to The Undertaker, Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman called out The Undertaker for one last match that night but instead Bo Dallas appeared and attempted to convince Lesnar to start \"Bo-lieving\". Lesnar responded by delivering a number of German suplexes on Dallas, and ending the beatdown with an F-5 before leaving. At Night of Champions, a Hell in a Cell match to settle the feud between Lesnar and Undertaker was scheduled for Hell in a Cell.\nAfter Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose's victory over The Wyatt Family, a rematch was booked the following night on \"Raw\". Midway through the match, a mysterious man (later revealed to be Braun Strowman) interfered on behalf of The Wyatt Family. The new Wyatt Family challenged Reigns and Ambrose to a six-man tag match at Night of Champions. Reigns and Ambrose refused to reveal their partner until right before the match.\nOn the following night's \"Raw\", The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston, with Xavier Woods) defeated The Lucha Dragons (Sin Cara and Kalisto). After the match, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) made their return to WWE, performing a 3D on Woods through a table and confronting The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil). The New Day would go on to retain their titles through 2015 and 2016. On December 13, 2016, The New Day's reigns reached 479 days, officially breaking the record set by Demolition to become the longest single reign in WWE history. Five days later, at the pay-per-view , they lost the titles to Cesaro and Sheamus.\nKevin Owens started setting his sights on the WWE Intercontinental Championship, leading to a feud with champion Ryback. On the September 7 episode of \"Raw\", Owens interrupted Ryback's interview and then attacked him, costing him a lumberjack match against Seth Rollins on the September 10 episode of \"SmackDown\" while Owens was one of the Lumberjacks. On the September 14 episode of \"Raw\", Ryback was granted permission by The Authority to defend the Intercontinental Championship against Owens at Night of Champions.\nThe 2015 SummerSlam was the last SummerSlam to occur before the reintroduction of the brand extension in July 2016, which again split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown brands, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. As such, another world championship was introduced. After the WWE World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to SmackDown and renamed to WWE Championship, the WWE Universal Championship was introduced for Raw with its inaugural champion crowned at the 2016 SummerSlam."

        "text": "The Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League, also known as the Dhaka Premier League, is a club List A tournament in Bangladesh.\nHistory.\nSince its inauguration in 1973–74 the league has been the premier club cricket competition in Bangladesh. Occupying more than 200 players for two months each year, it is widely regarded as the \"finishing school\" for cricketers in Bangladesh. It gained List A status starting with the 2013–14 tournament, thus superseding the National Cricket League One-Day as Bangladesh's main List A competition.\nIn the years from 1973–74 to 2011–12, Abahani Limited won the championship 17 times. Other winners were Mohammedan Sporting Club nine times, Biman Bangladesh Airlines five times, Victoria Sporting Club four times, Old DOHS Sports Club twice and Brothers Union once. There was no tournament in 2012–13.\nTo commemorate the centenary of the birth of the founding father of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the 2019–20 season of the league was named \"Bangabandhu Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League 2019–20\". However, the competition was postponed shortly after starting and later abandoned, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next tournament, in 2021–22, was officially named the \"Bangabandhu Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League 2021–2022 sponsored by Walton\".\nList A winners.\nSince the tournament gained List A status, the winners have been:\nFormat.\nThe competition is played as a round-robin, followed by play-off rounds among the top six teams for the championship and among the lowest three teams to determine relegation.\nThe 2013–14 competition ran from September to November 2014; the 2014–15 competition ran from November 2014 to January 2015; the 2015–16 competition ran from April to June 2016; the 2016–17 competition ran from April to June 2017; the 2017–18 competition ran from February to April 2018; the 2018–19 competition ran from March to April 2019; the 2019–20 competition began in March 2020, but was almost immediately postponed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic; the next tournament, 2021–22, ran from March to April 2022, and the 2022–23 tournament ran from March to May 2023.\nAll matches are played on neutral grounds in the Dhaka area. In 2016–17 only three grounds were used: Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium in Fatullah, and Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan No 3 and No 4 Grounds in Savar. The same three grounds were used in 2017–18 and 2018–19, as well as Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur.\nPlayers.\nThe system of allocating players to clubs varies from season to season, but has elements of lottery. Players frequently change clubs between seasons. Imrul Kayes, for example, played for Victoria Sporting Club in 2006–07 and 2014–15, Mohammedan Sporting Club in 2007–08, 2011–12, 2022–23 and 2023–24, Gazi Tank Cricketers in 2008–09 and 2013–14, Abahani Limited in 2009–10 and 2010–11, Brothers Union in 2015–16, Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club in 2016–17 and 2021–22, and Gazi Group Cricketers in 2017–18 and 2018–19. Of the 22 players who appeared for Brothers Union in 2013–14, only two were among the 20 Brothers Union players in 2014–15.\nFrom the 1980s to the 2019–20 competition most teams included players from outside Bangladesh. In 2013–14 82 foreign players played in the competition. Beginning with the 2015–16 competition, only one foreign player has been allowed in any playing eleven, although clubs are allowed to have several foreign players on their list; in 2015–16 36 foreign players took part, including 22 Indians and 10 Sri Lankans. Foreign players were excluded from the 2019–20 competition, but were allowed again for the 2021–22 competition, with no more than one foreign player per team per match.\nTeams.\nThere are 12 participating teams, changing each season with promotion and relegation. The two lowest-finishing teams are demoted to the second division, the Dhaka First Division Cricket League, for the next season and the top two teams in the second division are promoted.\n2013–14.\nCricket Coaching School played the first six matches but were demoted after failing to arrive at their seventh match in time to play.\n2014–15.\nGazi Tank Cricketers changed their name to Legends of Rupganj.\n2019–20.\nOwing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was abandoned shortly after it began. The pandemic also prevented the 2020–21 tournament from going ahead.\n2021–22.\nPrime Doleshwar Sporting Club were scheduled to take part, but withdrew shortly before the tournament began, leaving 11 teams.\nRecords.\nOther records.\nThe fastest century is by Brendan Taylor, who reached 100 off 46 balls for Prime Bank against Kalabagan Cricket Academy in 2013–14.\nThe highest team score is 393 for 4 by Abahani against Prime Doleshwar in 2017–18."

Each of the final three matches of the season were curtailed by at least a day because of rain, and ended in draws. Their performances were enough to rank them third among all counties in the standings, and in his history of Somerset cricket, David Foot describes it as the season that led to Somerset being taken seriously as a club. He praised the leadership of the club's captain, Herbie Hewett, who picked players on merit, rather than \"the strength of his social charm and ability to drink into the early hours.\" Despite their general success, the county did suffer a heavy defeat to Lancashire in early August. After no play on the first day due to rain, Somerset lost the match on the second day, being bowled out twice for fewer than 100 runs.

Playing a year above age for England Under-18's, Stephenson captained the side as they returned home from the FIRA/AER tournament in Madrid as champions.\nHe made his first senior appearance for Northampton Saints in 2012 against Harlequins and became a staple member of the senior team for the 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons. The 2013/14 saw Stephenson come off the bench in both the European Rugby Challenge Cup final and the Aviva Premiership final. Northampton won both games recording their first ever double winning season.\nHaving already travelled with England Under-20s in 2012/13, Stephenson then went to New Zealand, picking up a Junior World Championship winners' medal for the second year on the bounce.\nHis run in the senior team has been marred by injuries in recent seasons, Stephenson only featured in two games for the Saints in 2015/16 due to injury and sat out the entire 2016/17 season after a double leg break during a pre-season friendly against Rotherham Titans.\nIt was announced on 30 May 2017 that Stephenson would join fellow Saints teammate Tom Collins in travelling to Australia for the summer to progress his rugby after returning from injury late in the season. The pair linked up with Randwick in Sydney.\nOn 27 March 2018 it was confirmed that Stephenson would be leaving his childhood club Northampton Saints after 5 years. He joined London Irish where he remained until July 2020.\nHe signed for National League 1 side Rosslyn Park ahead of the 2020–21 season."

Eight teams participated in the tournament, which formed part of the 2012–18 World Cricket League and the qualification process for the 2019 World Cup. Three teams (the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, and Vanuatu) qualified based on their positions in earlier WCL tournaments, while the other five (Botswana, Fiji, Norway, Saudi Arabia, and Suriname) qualified after winning regional qualifiers.\nSaudi Arabia failed to arrive for the tournament after they were unable to secure visas for their team. As a result the ICC decided to cancel all of their matches in the tournament, with Group B being reduced to three teams, Cayman Islands, Vanuatu and Norway.\nThe competition's final was played at the County Ground in Chelmsford, with Suriname defeating Guernsey by six wickets. Both teams were promoted to the 2016 Division Five tournament. However, in March 2016, Suriname withdrew from the Division Five tournament due to an ICC investigation about the eligibility of some of their players.

        "text": "The 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 88th edition of the Major League Baseball All Star Game. The game was hosted by the Miami Marlins and was played at Marlins Park on July 11, 2017. It was televised nationally by Fox. The game was the first since 2002 whose outcome did not determine home-field advantage for the World Series; instead, the team with the better regular-season record will have home-field advantage. The Marlins were announced as the hosts on February 10, 2015, by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred; the game was the Marlins' first time hosting, leaving the Tampa Bay Rays as the only MLB franchise not to have hosted an All-Star game.\nThe Marlins initially were slated to host the 2000 All-Star Game, prior to having it revoked by then-National League president Len Coleman due to the concerns of both the franchise's long-term viability in the South Florida market, along with the habitually low attendance figures at Pro Player Stadium. That game was eventually moved to Turner Field in Atlanta. The Houston Astros led all of baseball in sending a record six All-Stars to the game.\nThe American League won, 2–1, in 10 innings. Robinson Canó, second baseman for the Seattle Mariners, hit the game-winning home run for the American League and was named the 2017 All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.\nFan balloting.\nStarters.\nBalloting for the 2017 All-Star Game starters began online May 1 and ended on June 29. The top vote-getters at each position (including the designated hitter for the American League) and the top three among outfielders, would be starters for their respective leagues. The results were announced on July 2. Bryce Harper was the leading vote-getter with 4,630,306 votes.\nFinal roster spot.\nAfter the rosters were finalized, a second ballot of five players per league was created for the All-Star Final Vote to determine the 33rd and final player of each roster. The online balloting was conducted from July 2 through July 6. The winners of the All-Star Final Vote were Mike Moustakas of the American League's Kansas City Royals and Justin Turner of the National League's Los Angeles Dodgers.\nGame summary.\nThe game was mostly pitching-dominated through the first four innings. After a two-out double by Jonathan Schoop, Miguel Sanó finally got the AL on the board with his fifth inning RBI bloop single. In the bottom of the sixth, Yadier Molina became the oldest catcher to hit a home run in an All-Star game, when he hit one off Ervin Santana in the sixth inning, tying the game at one. Reggie Smith was the last Cardinal to hit an All-Star Game home run in the 1974 game. Robinson Canó hit the game-winning home run in the tenth inning off Wade Davis, and was named the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player. He is the first second baseman since 1998 who was named All-Star Game MVP. Andrew Miller struck out Cody Bellinger swinging to end the night and earned his first career All-Star save.\nNational Anthems.\nJocelyn Alice sang the Canadian national anthem while Bebe Rexha sang the American national anthem.\nRatings.\nThe viewership ratings for the game on FOX were up slightly following the previous year's all-time low, with a 5.5 national rating, an 11 share, and an estimated 9.28 million viewers."

        "text": "The 2014 Philippine Basketball Marathon was the longest basketball match played according to the Guinness World Records from 2014 to 2021. The basketball game which was contested by Team Walang Iwanan and Team Bounce Back took place from March 24 to 29, 2014 at the Meralco Gym in Metro Manila. The match had a duration of 120 hours, one minute and 7.8 seconds. The marathon was a fund raising event to provide housing in an area in Negros Occidental which was devastated from Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda). The marathon broke the record set at the Missouri Athletic Club which took place in St. Louis, Missouri, on March 21–25, 2012 with the game duration of 112 hours and 13 seconds.\nThe World's Longest Basketball Game held from August 6 to 11, 2021, which doubles as a charity event for Western New York mental health organizations, surpassed the record set by the Philippine basketball game.\nBackground.\nThe Philippine Basketball Marathon was a Guinness world record attempt to beat the record set at the Missouri Athletic Club which took place in St. Louis, Missouri, from March 21–25, 2012 with the game duration of 112 hours and 13 seconds.\nThe Missouri match was between Team Joplin and Team St. Louis with the game ending 11,588–11,506 in favor of Team Joplin. Guinness laid provisions that 24 players in two teams were to participate in the Missouri attempt. Six players from each team played while six either rested, ate or receive medical attention.\nThe Philippine attempt also doubled as a charity event since it was also held as part of the \"Bounce Back Phl\" project which aimed to raise funds to construct a Basketball Marathon (BM) Village in an area in Negros Occidental which was left devastated following the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda). The funds raised will be transferred to the \"Operation Walang Iwanan\" () project of Gawad Kalinga for this purpose. The BM Village will contain 24 houses, a basketball court and a community hall where the beneficiaries of the project may participate in livelihood programs of the charity organization. Construction of the village was scheduled in mid-2014. Gawad Kalinga also partnered with Asian Cable Enterprises, Inc. to organize the match.\nSimilarly, the Missouri match was a fundraiser for the recovery process following the aftermath of the 2011 Joplin tornado. More than $100,000 was raised which was distributed by the Joplin Area Chamber of Commerce.\nPreparation.\nRoster selection.\nIn 2013, 300,000 online applicants vied to be included in the two teams of the 2014 Philippine Basketball Marathon. From these, 100 were shortlisted. The 100 were evaluated by coaches on their basketball playing skills and overall fitness and 30 players were selected for another shortlist of 30 players. 24 players were then selected for the final 24.\nAll in all the selection process included two try outs, extensive medical test and a panel interview held within two days.\nHead coach Johnedel Cardel who leads the basketball team of the Rizal Technological University remarked that a mix of young and more mature teams for the final 24 was deliberate and said that the basketball match was less than physical endurance and more on mental toughness and perseverance.\nThe selected players passed a series of medical tests and doctor consultations at The Medical City to ensure that they have the capability to play basketball for more than 112 hours.\nTraining.\nThe players involved in the match underwent training and physical conditioning at the Rizal Technological University. The focus of the training was to enhance the players' stamina by developing their legs and lower back. To build the players' endurance, the coaches introduced cardio workouts, plyometics, and physical conditioning exercises and routines from football. The players also had a high-protein diet.\nMatch day.\nDoctors and three ambulances were deployed in standby as a precautionary measure during the game.\nFormat.\nThe match was played under FIBA rules. There were no time outs and halftime break. Fouls of all players reverts to 0 every 2 hours.\nGuinness has set guidelines that players should \"play within the spirit of the rules of the sport\" and are not leave the court in the entire duration of the match.\nMatch details.\nThe match tip off was scheduled at 07:00 PST but the game started at some hours later than initially planned at 09:00. Pasig Mayor Bobby Eusebio and Samahang Basketball ng Pilipinas executive director Sonny Barrios were invited to kick off the event.\nAftermath.\nThe game that began around 09:00 PST on March 24 ended around the same time on March 29. By around 1:00 am on March 29, the world record set at the Missouri Athletics Club was broken. The whole game's duration was 120 hours, one minute and 7.8 seconds.\nVerification by Guinness.\nFollowing the end of the game, Guinness didn't immediately recognize the world record accomplished by the basketball match and underwent a review by a Guinness adjudicator if there were violations to the provisions laid by the world record organization.\nAccess Discovery Channel was concerned that Guinness won't recognize the feat due to technicality reasons. Jacque Ruby, chief operating officer of organization is cited two guidelines which states that participants “have to play within the spirit of the rules of the sport” and the other is the prohibition of players from leaving the court. Ruby noted that during the \"graveyard shift\" players are \"not running anymore, stays at the other end and just waits for the ball\" which he says that \"it's not an actual game anymore. He also noted that players also occasionally went to the toilet which is located outside the court.\nThe guidelines set for Guinness were reportedly strict compared to when it verified the Missouri Athletic Club match. Were a smaller board was used and there was no 24-second shot clock. The Missouri Athletic Club attempt was not recorded in videotape in whole and players were allowed to play barefoot.\nOn March 30, 2014, radio station DZBB-AM reported that Guinness has officially recognized the new world record set by the Philippine Basketball Marathon.\nRecognition.\nHouse Resolution 01487 was adopted in the Philippine House of Representatives on September 10, 2014, to congratulate and commend the two teams, along with the Samahang Basketball ng Pilipinas organizing committee for the world record feat. The resolution was authored by Eric Olivares and Anthony Del Rosario of the Committee on Youth and Sports Development. The Philippine Basketball Marathon received a citation at the 2015 PSA Annual Awards.\nNew record.\nThe World Longest Basketball Game, a charity event for Western New York mental health organization, was held from August 6 to 11, 2021. Following its conclusion, the basketball game was recognized as the longest by the Guinness World Records."

The selection was made at the 70th IOC Session in Amsterdam on 12 May 1970. In a 1972 referendum, voters in Colorado rejected funding for the Olympics, and for the only time a city awarded the Olympics rejected them. Denver officially withdrew on 15 November, and the IOC then offered the Olympics to Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, but they too declined owing to a change of government following elections. Whistler went on to be associated with neighbouring Vancouver's successful bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nSion, the runner-up, also declined. Salt Lake City, Utah offered to host the Olympics, but the IOC, still reeling from the Denver rejection, declined and selected Innsbruck to host the 1976 Winter Olympics, which had hosted the 1964 Winter Olympics twelve years earlier, on 5 February 1973.

The postseason tournament concluded with Super Bowl 50, on February 7, when the Denver Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\nFor this year only, the Super Bowl decided not to use a Roman numeral (\"L\") and instead used the standard numerals \"50.\" According to Jaime Weston, the league's vice president of brand and creative, the primary reason was that the league's graphic designers had difficulty designing a suitable, aesthetically pleasing logo with only the Roman numeral \"L\".\nNFL playoff schedule.\nIn a change from previous seasons, both AFC wild card games were played on the Saturday, and then both NFC Wild Card games were played on the Sunday (instead of having a game from each conference on the same day).\nTelevision coverage.\nAll playoff games aired on network television. This was the NFL's standard policy through the end of the previous television contract in 2013. After airing one game exclusively on cable on ESPN in 2014, the lone game which The Walt Disney Company owns the rights to was broadcast on both ESPN and ABC, a broadcast network with a much larger audience. From Disney's purchase of ESPN and ABC in 1996 through 2005, ABC had aired all of Disney's playoff games (the network also aired Monday Night Football at the time). The last such broadcast was Super Bowl XL after the 2005 season. Disney did not own any playoff rights from 2006 through 2013.\nThe ABC/ESPN simulcast was an AFC Wild Card game, while CBS broadcast the rest of the AFC playoff games. Coverage of the NFC Wild Card and Divisional rounds was split between NBC and Fox, with each network having coverage of one game in each of those two rounds. Fox had exclusive coverage of the NFC Championship Game while CBS had exclusive coverage of the AFC Championship Game and Super Bowl 50.\nESPN Deportes served as the league's Spanish-language broadcaster.\nSky Sports served as the UK's main NFL broadcaster with the BBC showing highlights.\nWild Card Playoffs.\nFor the first time since the wild card round expanded to four games in 1990–91, all four playoff games on wild card weekend were won by the visiting teams. It also marked the first time in that all of the wild card teams advanced past the first round of the playoffs (this was only possible from 1970–71 until 1977–78 and since 2002–03, because playoff formats between 1978–79 and 2001–02 included first-round games between two wild card teams).\nSaturday, January 9, 2016.\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 30, Houston Texans 0.\nKansas City, who started the season 1–5 before winning their next 10 games, forced five turnovers and held the Texans to 226 total yards as they earned their first postseason win since the 1993 season (a game also played at Houston, against the Oilers), and the first shutout victory in an NFL playoff game in 10 years. It is the first (and to date only) time the Texans have been shut out at home.\nChiefs running back Knile Davis gave his team a 7–0 lead just 11 seconds into the game by returning the opening kickoff 106 yards for a touchdown, making him the first player to score a touchdown on the first kickoff of an NFL postseason. The two teams went on to exchange punts, and then interceptions, as Texans quarterback Brian Hoyer was picked off by Eric Berry and Alex Smith returned the favor with a pass that bounced out of the hands of Jeremy Maclin and was intercepted by linebacker Brian Cushing.\nHouston then drove to the Chiefs' 30-yard line, but on 3rd-and-7, Hoyer lost a fumble while being sacked by Allen Bailey, and defensive tackle Dontari Poe recovered it on the Chiefs' 42-yard line. Kansas City subsequently drove 27 yards, including an 18-yard catch by tight end Travis Kelce, to go up 10–0 on a 49-yard Cairo Santos field goal. On the Chiefs' next possession, Kelce caught a 25-yard pass on a 40-yard drive that ended on another 49-yard field goal by Santos, making the score 13–0. Houston took the ball back and drove to the Kansas City 3-yard line, but linebacker Josh Mauga's interception kept them off the scoreboard going into halftime.\nHouston started the second half with a drive to the Chiefs' 40-yard line, but ended up punting. Shane Lechler managed to pin Kansas City back on their own 6-yard line with a 34-yard punt. But despite two holding penalties against the Chiefs, one of which nullified a 64-yard scramble by Smith, they still drove 94 yards in 11 plays for their first touchdown. Maclin was a key part of the drive, catching two passes for 23 yards, though on the second one he suffered a game-ending injury; Smith also completed a 16-yard pass to Kelce and finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to rookie receiver Chris Conley, give the Chiefs a 20–0 lead.\nOn their next drive, the Texans had to punt after three plays, and then saw Kansas City drive 71 yards in eight plays, featuring a 48-yard reception by Kelce, to score on 5-yard touchdown run by Spencer Ware. Houston managed to respond with a drive to the Chiefs' 24-yard line, only to lose the ball when Bailey again forced a fumble while sacking Hoyer on fourth down. The Texans' defense forced a punt, but Dustin Colquitt's 56-yard kick pinned them back on their 8-yard line. On the next play, Hoyer was intercepted by Sean Smith on the 20-yard line, leading to Santos' third field goal to make the final score 30–0.\nSmith completed 17 of 22 passes for 190 yards with a touchdown and an interception. His top target was Kelce, who caught eight passes for 128 yards, while Ware was the top rusher for the Chiefs with 67 yards and a touchdown. Bailey had four tackles, two sacks, and two forced fumbles. Hoyer was held to just 15 of 34 passes for 134 yards and was intercepted four times. Alfred Blue was the game's leading rusher with 99 yards on 17 carries. Cushing had 13 tackles and an interception, while linebacker Whitney Mercilus had five tackles and three sacks.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Texans.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 18, Cincinnati Bengals 16.\nThis game ended up being a rain-soaked vicious battle between two AFC North rivals, filled with injuries and personal fouls on both sides. After falling behind 15–0, the Bengals scored three times in the fourth quarter to take a 16–15 lead. But with less than a minute left in the game, two consecutive personal fouls against Cincinnati's defense got the Steelers close enough for Chris Boswell to make a 35-yard field goal with 18 seconds left on the clock.\nThe game started off as a defensive battle with both teams punting at the end of its first eight drives. With less than six minutes left in the second quarter, Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict forced a fumble from Markus Wheaton that safety George Iloka recovered on the Cincinnati 47-yard line. But a few plays later, Bengals quarterback A. J. McCarron threw an interception to Antwon Blake, who returned it 35 yards to the Bengals' 41-yard line. A 23-yard completion from Ben Roethlisberger to Antonio Brown on the ensuing drive set up Boswell's 39-yard field goal. Following a punt, Roethlisberger completed a 16-yard pass to running back Fitzgerald Toussaint and a 24-yard pass to Wheaton – with a personal foul penalty on safety Shawn Williams adding another 15 yards – to set up Boswell's 30-yard field goal just before halftime. Despite the Steelers' slim 6–0 lead, they had dominated the stat sheet, holding Cincinnati to just 56 yards and two first downs.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, the Bengals seemed primed to score when Jeremy Hill broke free for a 38-yard run to the Steelers' 29-yard line. But on the next play, McCarron lost a fumble due to a hit by linebacker Jarvis Jones. Defensive end Cam Thomas recovered the ball and ended up losing it while being tackled, then William Gay picked it up and returned it for a touchdown. However, replays showed that Thomas was down by contact before he lost the fumble, and a 15-yard penalty against Gay for excessive celebration moved the ball all the way back to Pittsburgh's 36-yard line. Receiver Martavis Bryant's 44-yard run on an end-around play then set up Boswell's 34-yard field goal that gave the Steelers a 9–0 lead. Following a punt, Roethlisberger completed a 60-yard pass to Brown on the Bengals' 10-yard line. Then he threw a pass in the back of the end zone to Bryant, who made a diving somersault catch and maintained possession for a touchdown by pinning the ball against one leg while falling to the ground. However, Pittsburgh's two-point conversion attempt failed, so the score remained 15–0. Cincinnati responded with a drive to the Steelers' 23-yard line, but committed another turnover when running back Giovani Bernard lost a fumble that was forced and recovered by linebacker Ryan Shazier, who leveled Bernard with a devastating helmet leading hit that knocked the running back out of the game and out of consciousness. Shazier was not penalized for the hit, much to the dismay of the home crowd.\nOn the last play of the third quarter, Burfict sacked Roethlisberger for a 12-yard loss, forcing a punt from the Steelers' 5-yard line and temporarily knocking Roethlisberger out of the game with a shoulder injury. After Jordan Berry's 41-yard punt gave the Bengals a first down on the Pittsburgh 46-yard line, Will Allen committed a 42-yard pass interference penalty while trying to cover A. J. Green. Hill then got the ball into the end zone with consecutive carries, the second a 1-yard touchdown run that made the score 15–7. The Steelers, now led by Landry Jones, started off their next drive well, as Jordan Todman rushed for a 25-yard gain on the second play. But an 11-yard sack by Carlos Dunlap and Pat Sims ultimately forced the Steelers to punt. McCarron started the Bengals' drive off with two completions to Hill for 24 total yards. Later on, he converted a 3rd-and-9 with an 18-yard completion to tight end Tyler Eifert, and eventually the Bengals got close enough for Mike Nugent to kick a 36-yard field goal, making the score 15–10 with 5:17 left. The Steelers had to punt after three plays on their ensuing possession, and Adam Jones' 24-yard return gave the Bengals the ball on the Pittsburgh 45-yard line. McCarron soon faced a 4th-and-2 situation, but converted with a 9-yard completion to Marvin Jones. Then when faced with 3rd-and-7, he launched a 25-yard touchdown pass to Green. After their two-point conversion failed, the Bengals held a 16–15 lead with 1:45 left. On the first play after the kickoff, Landry Jones threw an interception to Burfict on the Steelers' 26-yard line. He celebrated by running all the way through the tunnel. But with the game now seemingly in the Bengals' control, they gave the ball right back on the next play when Shazier forced a fumble from Hill that was recovered by Ross Cockrell.\nNow with the ball on his own 11-yard line with 1:23 left, Roethlisberger returned to lead his team 74 yards in nine plays for the game-winning score. After several short completions moved the ball to the 37-yard line, Pittsburgh faced a 4th-and-3, but overcame it on Brown's 12-yard reception. On the next play, with just 22 seconds left, Roethlisberger threw a pass intended for Brown. The pass was incomplete, but Burfict was flagged for a personal foul for contact with Brown's helmet. Brown was injured on the play, and as he was being attended and officials were dealing with both teams, Adam Jones was flagged for a personal foul after an altercation with Steelers linebackers coach Joey Porter, giving the Steelers another 15 yards and moving the ball to the Bengals' 17-yard line. On the next play, Boswell kicked a 35-yard field goal with 18 seconds left to win the game.\nRoethlisberger completed 18 of 31 passes for 221 yards and a touchdown, while Brown caught seven passes for 119 yards and Todman was the game's leading rusher with 65 yards. Shazier had 13 tackles – nine of which were solo tackles – a pair of forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery. McCarron completed 23 of 41 passes for 213 yards, with a touchdown and an interception. Hill rushed for 50 yards and a touchdown, while also catching three passes for 27 yards. Green caught five passes for 71 yards and a touchdown, while Burfict had six tackles, a sack, an interception, and a forced fumble.\nThis marked another round of playoff futility for the Bengals, who lost their fifth playoff game in a row after starting the season 8–0 and finishing with a franchise record tying 12–4 record, despite losing starting quarterback Andy Dalton to a broken thumb injury in week 14. Bengals coach Marvin Lewis' playoff record fell to 0–7, the most losses ever by a coach without a postseason win. After the game, Dalton stated that \"This locker room should feel a lot different right now. We won that game and then we didn't\".\nSportswriter Mike Freeman called this game \"one of the dirtiest and ugliest contests in the modern era of the sport\". Burfict received a 3-game suspension for his hit on Brown (including the Week 2 matchup between the two teams), while four players and two assistant coaches also received fines. Jones received the most severe fine at $28,000, while Steelers guard Ramon Foster was fined $17,000. Bengals defensive tackles Wallace Gilberry and Domata Peko each received an $8,600 fine, while Porter and fellow Steelers assistant coach Mike Munchak were fined $10,000 each. In the offseason, the league passed a rule banning any coaches except for the head coach from entering the field of play, and then only to check on an injured player, directly in response to the incident.\nOn January 16, the NFL Vice President of Officiating, Dean Blandino, stated that the Martavis Bryant catch was not an actual catch. \"I don't think this is a catch, if I just had a blank slate and I could say, do you think it's a catch or not a catch? I would say no catch.\" said Blandino. Unfortunately, that catch for a touchdown cost the game for the Bengals.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Steelers and Bengals. Pittsburgh won the previous meeting 31–17 in the 2005 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nSunday, January 10, 2016.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 10, Minnesota Vikings 9.\nIn their final game at TCF Bank Stadium – prior to the Vikings' move to U.S. Bank Stadium for the 2016 season – Minnesota kicker Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard field goal attempt with 22 seconds remaining as the Seahawks held on to win 10–9. The temperature at kickoff was , making this the third coldest game in NFL history.\nOn their first possession Seattle went three-and-out, but punter Jon Ryan bobbled a low snap and was unable to get off a punt, giving Minnesota possession at the Seattle 29-yard line. The Vikings drove to the 4-yard line but had to settle for a Walsh field goal to open the scoring. After both teams punted on their next possession, Seattle drove to the Vikings' 30-yard line and faced a 4th-and-13. Rather than attempt a field goal, Russell Wilson threw a pass to Fred Jackson who was tackled short of a first down after a 7-yard gain. Neither team could score for the rest of the half, and Minnesota went to halftime leading 3–0. Both teams combined for 185 total yards in the half, the lowest in a playoff game since 2005.\nOn the first possession of the second half Seattle drove into Minnesota territory and again went for it on fourth down, only for Wilson to be intercepted by Trae Waynes. Minnesota was then helped by a penalty for Cliff Avril roughing the passer, and Walsh kicked a 43-yard field goal to give them a 6–0 lead. Seattle went three-and-out on their next drive, and Minnesota began their drive in Seahawks territory after a horse collar tackle on the punt return. They settled for another Walsh field goal, this time from 47-yards out, to take a 9–0 lead into the fourth quarter. With the ball on the Vikings' 39-yard line on the ensuing drive, Wilson could not handle the snap and recovered it back at his own 45-yard line, but then found Tyler Lockett for a 35-yard completion. Two plays later Wilson threw a touchdown to Doug Baldwin, cutting the deficit to 9–7. On Minnesota's second play of the next drive Kam Chancellor forced an Adrian Peterson fumble which was recovered by Ahtyba Rubin at the Vikings' 40-yard line. Steven Hauschka converted on a 46-yard field goal to put Seattle ahead 10–9 with 8:04 remaining. Both teams punted on their next two drives, and Minnesota took possession with 1:42 left on their own 39-yard line. With a 19-yard pass interference call on Chancellor and a 24-yard pass from Teddy Bridgewater to Kyle Rudolph, Minnesota advanced to the Seattle 9-yard line with 26 seconds remaining. Walsh, however, kicked the 27-yard field goal wide left, allowing Seattle to kneel out the clock and preserve the victory.\nBridgewater finished as the leading passer with 146 yards, while Wilson recorded 142 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Seattle held Peterson, the league's leading rusher during the regular season, to just 45 yards on 23 carries. The win was Wilson's seventh playoff victory, the most by a quarterback within his first four seasons. Seattle became just the fifth team to win a playoff game despite scoring ten or fewer points, and the first since 1997.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Vikings.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 35, Washington Redskins 18.\nGreen Bay erased an early 11–0 deficit by scoring on five consecutive possessions on the way to a 35–18 victory over the Redskins.\nEarly in the first quarter, Tress Way's 57-yard punt and a 12-yard penalty against Green Bay pinned the Packers back at their own 8-yard line. A few plays later, Preston Smith sacked Aaron Rodgers in the end zone for a safety, giving Washington a 2–0 lead. On the ensuing drive the Redskins drove to the Green Bay 1-yard line with a 14-yard pass from Kirk Cousins to DeSean Jackson that was initially ruled a touchdown but reversed upon review. The Packers defense held the Redskins to a 25-yard Dustin Hopkins field goal, and Washington led 5–0 at the end of the first quarter.\nEarly in the second quarter, Washington drove 64 yards in seven plays, including a 20-yard reception by tight end Jordan Reed and a 13-yard catch by Pierre Garçon, to score on Cousins' 24-yard touchdown pass to Reed; Hopkins missed the extra point, therefore Washington took an 11–0 lead. Green Bay, however, responded by scoring 17 points by the end of the half. First, a 34-yard completion from Rodgers to James Jones set up a 12-yard touchdown pass to Randall Cobb. Then linebacker Mike Neal forced and recovered a fumble while sacking Cousins on the Packers' 46-yard line, resulting in a 30-yard drive that ended with Mason Crosby's 43-yard field goal. Washington had to punt on their next drive, and Micah Hyde returned the ball 17 yards to the Packers 40-yard line. Green Bay then drove 60 yards, including a 20-yard reception by Davante Adams on 3rd-and-2, to score on Rodgers' 10-yard touchdown toss to Adams, giving the team a 17–11 lead with 28 seconds left in the half.\nWashington regrouped on their first possession of the second half, scoring on a 9-play, 74-yard drive, starting off with a 21-yard reception by Garçon, and Alfred Morris had a 19-yard carry on the next play. Cousins later completed a 17-yard pass to Reed before finishing the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run, regaining the lead at 18–17.\nOn the Packers' ensuing drive, they faced a 4th-and-1 situation on the Redskins' 45-yard line. In what turned out to be a critical play, Eddie Lacy picked up the first down with an 11-yard run. Lacy added a 30-yard run on the next play, and James Starks finished the drive with a 4-yard rushing touchdown, giving the Packers a 24–18 lead. On their next drive the Packers scored for the fifth straight possession as a 22-yard carry by Starks set up Lacy's 2-yard touchdown run and Jared Abbrederis' 2-point conversion catch to make the score 32–18. Washington was unable to score again as Cousins was sacked twice on fourth down plays, once by linebacker Nick Perry and once by Neal. Perry's sack resulted in a turnover on the Redskins' 17-yard line, leading to Crosby's 29-yard field goal that made the final score 35–18.\nRodgers finished the game with 210 yards and a pair of touchdowns, while Cousins recorded 329 yards with a touchdown. Reed was the top receiver with nine receptions for 120 yards, becoming the first Redskins tight end with 100 receiving yards in a playoff game. This is now the last playoff game involving a team named, \"The Redskins\".\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Packers and Redskins. Both teams split their previous two meetings, the last of which Washington won 16–3 in the 1972 NFC Divisional playoffs.\nDivisional Playoffs.\nIn contrast to wild card weekend, all four of the home teams won their games this weekend.\nSaturday, January 16, 2016.\nAFC: New England Patriots 27, Kansas City Chiefs 20.\nPlaying in an NFL record-tying 30th postseason game, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady completed 28 of 42 passes for 302 yards and two touchdowns, without being sacked or throwing any interceptions, and also rushing for a score as he led the team to their fifth consecutive AFC championship game.\nNew England scored on their opening drive, moving the ball 80 yards in 11 plays. When faced with 3rd-and-13 on the Chiefs' 43-yard line, Brady completed a 32-yard pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski, and later found Gronkowski in the end zone for an 8-yard score. Kansas City responded with a 17-play, 64-yard drive, including quarterback Alex Smith's 15-yard run on 3rd-and-13. The Patriots defense managed to halt the drive on their own 16-yard line, forcing the Chiefs to settle for Cairo Santos' 34-yard field goal to make the score 7–3.\nIn the second quarter, Chiefs punter Dustin Colquitt's 33-yard kick pinned the Patriots back on their own 4-yard line, with a penalty against New England taking away another two yards. But it did not stop New England from driving 98 yards in 11 plays on a drive where they faced only two third downs. The key play of the drive was a 42-yard completion from Brady to receiver Keshawn Martin. Brady later ran the ball 10 yards to the Chiefs' 1-yard line on a scramble, and then took the ball into the end zone on the next play, giving the Patriots a 14–3 lead. Knile Davis returned the ensuing kickoff 34 yards, then Charcandrick West subsequently rushed for a 17-yard gain and Smith completed a 26-yard pass to Jason Avant; the team drove to a 32-yard Santos field goal that made the score 14–6 at halftime.\nKansas City started off the second half with a drive to the Patriots' 40-yard line. But linebacker Dont'a Hightower made a critical play, forcing and recovering a fumble from Davis after he caught a 9-yard pass. Taking the ball at the Chiefs' 31-yard line, Brady completed five consecutive passes for double-digit gains, the last one a 16-yard touchdown throw to Gronkowski that gave the team a 21–6 lead. Kansas City struck right back, converting two third downs and one fourth down on an 80-yard drive featuring a 26-yard reception by Avant. Smith finished the drive with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Albert Wilson, cutting their deficit to 21–13 with two minutes left in the third quarter.\nA few plays into the fourth quarter, Stephen Gostkowski gave the Patriots a 24–13 lead with a 40-yard field goal at the end of a drive that was sparked by Brady's 29-yard completion to running back James White. Kansas City had to punt on their next drive, and Danny Amendola returned the ball 22 yards to the Chiefs' 32-yard line, setting up another Gostkowski field goal that upped the New England lead to 27–13. Kansas City responded with a drive to the New England 49-yard line, but ended up turning the ball over on downs. Following a punt Kansas City got the ball back with 6:29 left. They proceeded to drive 80 yards in 16 plays for a score, including a 13-yard catch by Avant on 4th-and-8 and a 19-yard reception by Wilson. West finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run that made the score 27–20, with 1:13 remaining.\nKansas City attempted an onside kick, but failed to recover it. With all three of their timeouts left, they still had a chance to force a punt, but on the second play of New England's ensuing drive, Brady's 12-yard pass off a deflection to Julian Edelman sealed the victory for the Patriots, and ended Kansas City's 11-game winning streak.\nEdelman was the top receiver of the game with 10 receptions for 100 yards. Gronkowski caught seven passes for 83 yards and a pair of touchdowns; with eight career postseason touchdowns, Gronkowski – in his sixth season – set an all-time record for postseason touchdowns by a tight end. Smith completed 29 of a career-high 50 pass attempts for 246 yards and a touchdown. Avant, who caught just 15 passes during the season, was the Chiefs' leading receiver with four receptions for 69 yards. West was the leading rusher of the game with 61 yards and a touchdown, adding two receptions for 15 yards.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Patriots.\nNFC: Arizona Cardinals 26, Green Bay Packers 20 (OT).\nGreen Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers' 41-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Janis that tied the game on the last play of regulation was quickly answered by Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer, who threw a 75-yard completion to Larry Fitzgerald on the first play of overtime and then a 5-yard touchdown pass to him to win the game. This gave Palmer his first career playoff win at age 36, after 13 seasons in the NFL.\nAfter each team punted on their first possession, Patrick Peterson's 12-yard punt return gave the Cardinals a first down on the Packers' 42-yard line. Arizona then drove 42 yards in 11 plays, including a 2-yard run by David Johnson on 4th-and-1, to go up 7–0 on Palmer's 8-yard touchdown pass to receiver Michael Floyd. Following another exchange of punts, Green Bay drove 85 yards in 17 plays, featuring a 19-yard scramble by Rodgers, to cut the score to 7–3 on Mason Crosby's 28-yard field goal. This drive had two big plays nullified by penalties; one of which was a 51-yard one-handed catch by Randall Cobb that was wiped out by offsetting penalties on both teams. Not only did this eliminate the catch, but Cobb – the Packers' leading receiver during the season – was injured on the play and missed the rest of the game. Later on, Rodgers threw a pass that Peterson intercepted and returned 100 yards for a touchdown, but this was eliminated by an illegal use of hands penalty on defensive lineman Frostee Rucker. Following an Arizona punt, the Packers went on another long scoring drive, this one covering 71 yards in 17 plays and taking 7:55 off the clock. Receiver Jared Abbrederis had the drive's longest gain with an 18-yard reception, while Crosby added another field goal, making the score 7–6 with 55 seconds left in the half.\nFour plays into the third quarter, Cardinals safety Rashad Johnson intercepted a pass from Rodgers on the Packers' 47-yard line. A few plays later, Palmer also threw an interception, which was taken in by safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix. On the second play after the turnover, Eddie Lacy gained 14 yards. Then he stormed through the line for a 61-yard run to the Arizona 8-yard line. Rodgers eventually finished the drive with an 8-yard pass to Janis, giving Green Bay their first lead at 13–7. The Cardinals struck back with a 10-play, 74-yard drive, featuring a 32-yard reception by Fitzgerald, to cut the score to 13–10 with Chandler Catanzaro's 28-yard field goal. Following a Packers punt, Arizona drove to the Green Bay 10-yard line, but on the second play of the fourth quarter, cornerback Damarious Randall intercepted a pass from Palmer in the end zone. After Green Bay punted, Arizona got the ball on their own 20-yard line with 10:53 left. Palmer completed a 21-yard pass to John Brown on the second play of the drive, and later completed a 13-yarder to Fitzgerald. Eventually, the team got a first down on the Packers' 19-yard line. On the next play after that, Palmer threw a pass that bounced out of the hands of defensive back Sam Shields. After an incomplete pass, Palmer threw a pass to Johnson, who just barely managed to backpedal across the first down marker as he was falling to the ground. Then from the 9-yard line, Palmer threw a pass that was deflected by Randall, but fell right into the hands of Floyd for a touchdown, giving the Cardinals a 17–13 lead with 3:44 left.\nA few plays into their ensuing drive, Green Bay faced 4th-and-5 on their own 25-yard line. With only one timeout remaining, they decided to go for the first down, but Rodgers' pass was incomplete and the Cardinals took over with 2:38 left. Arizona was unable to get a first down on their drive, which included an incomplete pass that helped the Packers save some time. Catanzaro finished the drive with a 36-yard field goal, putting the Cardinals up 20–13, but the team had only managed to run 43 seconds off the clock, 1:55 remained. Green Bay got the ball back on their own 14-yard line with 1:50 left. Two incompletions and a 10-yard sack by Dwight Freeney brought up 4th-and-20, but Rodgers managed to overcome the situation by launching a 60-yard completion to Janis on the Arizona 36-yard line. With time ticking away, Rodgers rushed his team back to the line, appearing at first to want to spike the ball, but ran the play – the team could not get set before the snap, resulting in an illegal motion penalty that pushed them back five yards and cost them more time. After an incompletion, only five seconds remained in the game. Rodgers, took the snap, ran left and launched a Hail Mary pass to the end zone just before being leveled by linebacker Markus Golden. Janis then made a leaping catch in the end zone between two defenders for a 41-yard touchdown reception, sending the game into overtime. This was the first game-tying touchdown pass on the last play of regulation in postseason history and the second time that Rodgers threw a Hail Mary touchdown pass at the end of regulation in the season, after the \"Miracle in Motown\".\nArizona won the coin toss – which had to be redone after the coin did not flip in the air on the first attempt – and elected to receive. On their first play after the touchback, Palmer took the snap, evaded a tackle attempt by linebacker Mike Neal, ran right, and threw the ball to Fitzgerald on the left side the field just before being reached by defensive end Mike Daniels. Fitzgerald caught the ball wide open near the Arizona 35-yard line and broke three tackles as he took off for a 75-yard gain before he was dragged down by Casey Hayward on the Packers' 5-yard line. After an incompletion, Palmer flipped the ball to Fitzgerald on a shovel pass, and he took it into the end zone for the game winning score, giving the Cardinals their first playoff victory since  – also a home overtime win against the Packers they had won with a touchdown on the third play from scrimmage in overtime – and their first NFC Championship game since .\nPalmer completed 25 of 41 passes for 359 yards and three touchdowns, with two interceptions. Fitzgerald, who had a single reception for six yards in the first half, caught eight passes for 176 yards and a touchdown, his fifth consecutive 100-yard postseason game. Brown caught five passes for 82 yards. Rodgers finished the game 24 for 44 for 261 yards with a pair of touchdowns and an interception. Janis, who caught only two passes during the season, caught seven passes for 145 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Lacy was the top rusher of the game with 89 yards. The day after the game, the \"Arizona Republic\" celebrated the victory by titling the front page Hail Larry.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Packers and Cardinals. Both teams split the first two meetings, the last of which Arizona won 51–45 in OT in the 2009 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nSunday, January 17, 2016.\nNFC: Carolina Panthers 31, Seattle Seahawks 24.\nThe Panthers jumped out to a 31–0 halftime lead and held off a second half rally from the Seahawks to prevail 31–24 and advance to the NFC Championship for the first time since 2005.\nPanthers running back Jonathan Stewart ran for 59 yards to the Seahawks 16-yard line on the first offensive play of the game, then scored a touchdown from four yards out to give Carolina an early lead. Then, on the Seahawks' second play, Luke Kuechly intercepted a pass from Russell Wilson and returned it 14 yards for a touchdown, giving Carolina a 14–0 lead less than four minutes into the game. After forcing a Seahawks punt, Carolina mounted a 15-play, 86-yard drive which featured a 27-yard reception by tight end Greg Olsen and culminated in a Stewart 1-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter. Wilson then threw his second interception on the first play of the next drive, this time to Cortland Finnegan on the Seattle 29-yard line, and a Graham Gano 48-yard field goal put Carolina up 24–0. After a Seahawks three-and-out, Carolina drove 54 yards and scored another touchdown with a Cam Newton 19-yard pass Olsen. Now trailing 31–0, Seattle drove to the Carolina 18-yard line but turned the ball over on downs when Doug Baldwin was tackled a yard short of a first down on 4th-and-5. Seattle had another chance to cut the deficit at the end of the half, but Steven Hauschka missed a 55-yard field goal as time expired.\nSeattle got on the board on the first drive of the second half after Tyler Lockett returned the opening kickoff to 50 yards to midfield and Carolina was called for an unnecessary roughness penalty. Wilson found Jermaine Kearse for a 13-yard touchdown. After forcing a Panthers punt, Seattle drove 63 yards for another touchdown. Wilson rushed for 14 yards, completed a 16-yard pass to Kearse, and eventually finished the drive with 33-yard scoring pass to Lockett, cutting the deficit to 31–14. Seattle drove into Carolina territory again on their next drive which included a 17-yard first down run by DeShawn Shead on a fake punt, but Wilson was sacked for a 14-yard loss by Josh Norman and they were unable to score. On their next drive Wilson completed a 27-yard pass to Lockett that was originally ruled incomplete but overturned on review, then threw another touchdown to Kearse from three yards out to get to within 10 points with 6:11 remaining. Carolina was forced to punt again on their next possession, but Seattle was unable to find the end zone and settled for a 36-yard field goal. Now trailing by a touchdown with 1:12 remaining and only one timeout left, Seattle attempted an onside kick which was recovered by Carolina linebacker Thomas Davis, allowing the Panthers to run out the clock and preserve the victory.\nWilson finished with 366 yards on 31 of 48 passing with three touchdowns and two interceptions, while Newton had 161 yards and one touchdown. Stewart gained 106 yards on the ground, the first time in 27 games that Seattle had allowed a 100-yard rusher. Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch returned to the lineup after missing eight games but was held to just 20 yards on six carries. Kearse was the leading receiver with 11 receptions for 110 yards and two touchdowns. Their 31 points was a new Panthers franchise record in a playoff game. Seattle lost despite outgaining Carolina 280–72 in total yards during the second half.\nThis was the second consecutive postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Panthers and third overall. Seattle won both prior meetings, including 31–17 in the 2014 NFC Divisional playoffs.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 23, Pittsburgh Steelers 16.\nIn a tough defensive struggle in which both teams could only get the ball into the end zone once, Denver pulled ahead by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game.\nAt the end of the game's opening possession, Broncos safety Omar Bolden returned a punt 42 yards to the Pittsburgh 30-yard line, setting up Brandon McManus' 28-yard field goal. Later in the first quarter, Britton Colquitt's 57-yard punt pinned the Steelers back at their own 3-yard line. Pittsburgh was unable to get a first down with their ensuing drive, and Jordan Berry's 27-yard punt gave Denver a first down on the Steelers 31. Despite their excellent starting position, Denver could not get into the end zone and ended up with another McManus field goal to take a 6–0 lead. Pittsburgh took the ball back and stormed 80 yards in just five plays. First, Ben Roethlisberger completed a 23-yard pass to receiver Martavis Bryant. Then Bryant took a handoff on a reverse and raced 40 yards to the Broncos 16-yard line. Fitzgerald Toussaint finished the drive with two carries; the first for 15 yards and the second a 1-yard score that gave Pittsburgh a 7–6 lead with less than two minutes left in the first quarter.\nOn Pittsburgh's next possession, Roethlisberger's 58-yard completion to Darrius Heyward-Bey set up a 43-yard Chris Boswell field goal that increased their lead to 10–6. Denver had a chance to respond with a drive to the Steelers 37-yard line, but they turned the ball over with an incomplete pass on 4th-and-3. Late in the second quarter, Berry booted a 50-yard punt that gave the Broncos the ball at their own 5-yard line. But a 34-yard burst by running back C. J. Anderson sparked a 62-yard drive then ended with McManus' 51-yard field goal, cutting the score to 10–9 on the last play of the first half.\nAfter forcing Denver to punt of the first drive of the second half, Pittsburgh put together a 69-yard scoring drive featuring a 58-yard reception by Bryant. Boswell finished it with a 28-yard field goal, increasing the Steelers lead to 13–9. Denver had to punt again on their next drive, but Colquitt once again gave the team a big assist, this time with a 51-yard punt that put the ball on the Steelers 6-yard line. Pittsburgh could not get a first down, and Berry's 43-yard punt gave the ball back to Denver on their own 47-yard line. The Broncos were only able to move the ball 30 yards with their ensuing drive, but it was enough for McManus to make a 41-yard field goal, trimming their deficit to 13–12.\nPittsburgh took the ball back and drove to the Broncos 34-yard line, but were halted there and decided to punt instead of trying a long field goal. The Broncos also ended up punting, and Pittsburgh drove back to the Denver 34-yard line with three consecutive Roethlisberger completions for 39 total yards. But on the next play, the first turnover of the game occurred when safety Bradley Roby forced a fumble from Toussaint that was recovered by linebacker DeMarcus Ware.\nNow with 9:52 left in the game, 39-year old Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning took to the field and led the team 65 yards in 13 plays for the go-ahead score. The key play of the drive was a 31-yard completion from Manning to rookie receiver Bennie Fowler on 3rd-and-12 from the Broncos 33-yard line. Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact, with five carries for 18 yards. After Fowler's catch, the Broncos would not face another third down on the drive until the last play of the drive, when Anderson converted a 3rd-and-goal with a 1-yard touchdown run. Then Manning completed a pass to Demaryius Thomas for a 2-point conversion, giving the Broncos a 20–13 lead with three minutes left on the clock.\nPittsburgh started off their next drive with an 18-yard catch by Bryant, but ended up facing 4th-and-5 on their own 43-yard line with less than two minutes left. They tried to pick up a first down, but Ware sacked Roethlisberger for a 13-yard loss. Taking over at the Steelers 30-yard line, Denver forced Pittsburgh to use up all their timeouts with three consecutive running plays. Then McManus kicked a 45-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 23–13 lead with 53 seconds to go. A 20-yard pass interference penalty on safety T. J. Ward and a 22-yard reception by Bryant enabled Boswell to bring the deficit back to one score with a 47-yard field goal. But Anderson eliminated any chance of a comeback by recovering Boswell's ensuing onside kick.\nManning completed 22 of 37 passes for 222 yards. Emmanuel Sanders caught five of them for 85 yards. Anderson was the top rusher of the game with 72 yards and a touchdown, while also catching two passes for 11 yards. Ware had three tackles, a sack, and a fumble recovery. McManus tied a playoff record with five field goals. Roethlisberger finished the game 24 of 37 for 339 yards. Bryant caught nine passes for 154 yards and had two carries for 40 yards. Linebacker James Harrison had seven tackles and a sack.\nThis was the eighth postseason meeting between the Steelers and Broncos. Denver won four of the prior seven meetings, including the last meeting 29–23 in OT in the 2011 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 24, 2016.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 20, New England Patriots 18.\nDenver's defense sacked Patriots quarterback Tom Brady four times, knocked him down 20 times, intercepted two of his passes, forced a turnover on downs twice in the fourth quarter, and broke up a 2-point conversion attempt with 12 seconds left that enabled them to escape with a narrow 20–18 win, while the Patriots' defense sacked and knocked down Peyton Manning three times. With the win, the Broncos advanced to their second Super Bowl in three years and tied the Pittsburgh Steelers, Dallas Cowboys, and the Patriots for the most Super Bowl appearances with eight.\nOn Denver's first drive, quarterback Peyton Manning completed 4 of 6 passes for 60 yards on an 83-yard drive and then ended with his 21-yard touchdown pass to tight end Owen Daniels. Later in the quarter, Manning threw the ball on a screen pass to Ronnie Hillman that was broken up and then picked up by linebacker Jonathan Freeny. The play was initially ruled an incompletion, but a replay challenge from Bill Belichick changed the play to a New England fumble recovery on the Broncos 22-yard line, as officials ruled Manning's throw was a backwards pass instead of a forward pass. Brady completed a 20-yard pass to running back Brandon Bolden on the next play, with a penalty on Denver moving the ball up to the 1-yard line, and then Steven Jackson ran the ball into the end zone on the next play. However, Stephen Gostkowski, one of only five kickers to go through the regular season without missing an extra point, missed the extra point wide right, keeping the team behind with a score of 7–6.\nDenver had to punt on their next drive, but a few plays into the second quarter, Brady threw a pass that was intercepted by linebacker Von Miller and returned four yards to the Patriots 16-yard line. Manning then scored on another touchdown pass to Daniels, this one from 12 yards, to give the Broncos a 14–6 lead. New England responded with a 48-yard drive, with Brady completing a 19-yard pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski and later scrambling for an 11-yard gain on 3rd-and-10. But on 3rd-and-3 from the Broncos 22-yard line, Miller sacked Brady for a 6-yard loss, forcing the team to settle for 14–9 score on Gostkowski's 46-yard field goal. The next time New England got the ball, Brady was intercepted by safety Darian Stewart, who returned the ball eight yards to the Broncos 44-yard line. But a false start penalty and a sack by Alan Branch shut the drive down and Denver ended up punting. Britton Colquitt's 48-yard kick pinned the Pats back at their own 12-yard line, and following another punt, the Broncos got the ball back again on their 44-yard line. This time they managed to move the ball 23 yards and score on Brandon McManus' 52-yard field goal with 33 seconds left in the half, making the score 17–9 going into halftime.\nOn New England's first drive of the third quarter, Brady completed a 31-yard pass to Gronkowski that set up Gostkowski's 38-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 17–12. This would be the only score of the quarter as both teams punted on each of their next two drives. On the last play of the quarter, Denver receiver Jordan Norwood returned Ryan Allen's 43-yard punt six yards to the Broncos 39-yard line. Denver then drove 48 yards in 10 plays, including a 31-yard burst by running back C. J. Anderson, to score on McManus' 31-yard field goal, making the score 20–12 with 10:02 left on the clock. New England took the ball back and drove to the Broncos 16-yard line. But on 4th-and-1, Chris Harris tackled Julian Edelman for a 1-yard loss. Following a punt, New England got into the Broncos red zone again, this time driving all the way to the 14-yard line. This drive also ended with a turnover on downs, this time an incomplete pass on 4th-and-6.\nFollowing a three-and-out, Edelman returned Colquitt's 52-yard punt 16 yards to midfield with 1:52 left in the game. Brady threw three consecutive incompletions, but on 4th-and-10, he launched a 40-yard bomb to Gronkowski on the Broncos 10-yard line. A few plays later, the Patriots faced 4th-and-goal from the 4-yard line, but Brady proved up to the task again, throwing a 4-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski that made the score 20–18 with 12 seconds left on the clock. On the subsequent 2-point conversion attempt, Brady took a snap out of shotgun formation and threw a pass to Edelman, but the ball was deflected by Aqib Talib into the arms of defensive back Bradley Roby for an interception. Had New England converted the 2-point conversion, the game would have been sent to overtime for the first time in an AFC Championship in 29 years. New England then lost their last chance of the game when Gostkowski's onside kick attempt was recovered by Shiloh Keo.\nManning, who threw only one touchdown pass at home during the season, finished the game 17 of 32 for 176 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 11 yards. Anderson was the top rusher of the game with 72 yards on 16 carries, and also caught three passes for 18 yards. Miller had five tackles, 2½ sacks, and an interception. Brady finished his NFL record 31st postseason game 27 of 56 for 310 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions, while also leading the team in rushing with 13 yards. Gronkowski caught eight passes for 144 yards and a score. Linebacker Jamie Collins had eight tackles and two sacks.\nWith this win, Manning became the first quarterback to lead two different teams to the Super Bowl multiple times. Denver won despite being outgained in total yards 336 to 244. With the loss, the Patriots become the 11th consecutive team to surrender the Vince Lombardi Trophy to a new champion (the 2004 Patriots remain the last repeat World Champion).\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Patriots and Broncos. The home team had won all four prior meetings, in which Denver had won three of the prior four, including 26–16 in the 2013 AFC Championship Game. This was also the fifth and final postseason meeting between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning; all four were won by the home team, one of which was the 2007 AFC Championship Game in Indianapolis which Manning's Colts won en route to winning Super Bowl XLI.\nNFC: Carolina Panthers 49, Arizona Cardinals 15.\nCarolina dominated the game from start to finish, outgaining Arizona in total yards 476 to 287 and forcing seven turnovers in the first NFC Championship played at Bank of America Stadium. The Panthers accomplished this despite the loss of all-pro linebacker Thomas Davis and veteran safety Roman Harper, who both suffered game-ending injuries in the first half.\nOn the Panthers first drive, quarterback Cam Newton completed three passes for 32 yards and rushed for four yards on the way to a 45-yard Graham Gano field goal. Arizona had to punt on their next drive, and Ted Ginn Jr. returned it 32 yards to the Cardinals 49-yard line. Several plays later, he took a pitch on an end around play and raced 22 yards to the end zone, giving Carolina a 10–0 lead. At the end of Arizona's next drive, Drew Butler's 43-yard punt pinned the Panthers back at their own 12-yard line. On 3rd-and-8, Newton fired a pass to Corey Brown near the 40-yard line. Brown caught the ball, evaded a tackle attempt by Rashad Johnson, and took off for an 86-yard touchdown reception, making the score 17–0 with 49 seconds left in the first quarter. It was the longest play in Panthers postseason history.\nMeanwhile, the Cardinals offense continued to struggle, as quarterback Carson Palmer lost a fumble due to a hit by Kawann Short, which linebacker Luke Kuechly recovered on the Panthers 38-yard line. However, this time the Cardinals defense stepped up and forced a punt. Taking the ball back at their 21-yard line, Palmer completed four consecutive passes for 45 yards as the team drove 79 yards in 10 plays to score on David Johnson's 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the deficit to 17–7. Arizona's defense then forced another punt, but in what turned out to be a critical play, returner Patrick Peterson muffed the kick and defensive back Teddy Williams recovered it for Carolina on the Cardinals 46-yard line. Consecutive carries by Jonathan Stewart moved the ball 40 yards to the Arizona 1-yard line. Then on third down, Newton dove over the pile for a 1-yard touchdown that increased the Panthers lead to 24–7 with 1:56 left in the half.\nWhat followed was three turnovers over the span of the next four plays. First, Charles Johnson forced a fumble from Palmer that was recovered by safety Tre Boston on the Arizona 31-yard line. Then Newton returned the favor with a pass that was intercepted by Peterson, who returned it 72 yards. He appeared to be heading for the end zone, but Ginn managed to chase him down and tackle him on the Panthers 22-yard line. This turned out to be crucial, as on the next play, Palmer threw a pass that was intercepted in the end zone by safety Kurt Coleman with 49 seconds left until halftime.\nCarolina took the second half kickoff and drove 80 yards in 11 plays. Newton completed five consecutive passes for 76 yards on the drive, including two to tight end Greg Olsen for 43 total yards and a 14-yarder to fullback Mike Tolbert. Gano finished the drive with a 21-yard field goal that put the team up 27–7. After a punt, Newton completed a 39-yard pass to Ginn and a 17-yard strike to Devin Funchess. Then he finished the possession with consecutive carries, the first for 11 yards, and the second a 12-yard touchdown run that increased their lead to 34–7.\nArizona took the ball back and drove for a touchdown, as Palmer completed 7 of 8 passes for 80 yards, the last one a 21-yard scoring pass to tight end Darren Fells. Then J. J. Nelson ran the ball in for a 2-point conversion, cutting the score to 34–15 less than a minute into the fourth quarter. Following a punt, Arizona drove to the Panthers 44-yard line, but their last hope of a comeback slipped away when Palmer threw a pass that was picked off by Coleman for his second interception of the day. After that, Newton completed a 54-yard pass to Olsen, rushed for 14 yards, and finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Funchess. Then his 2-point conversion pass to Tolbert put the team up 42–15. After the ensuing kickoff, Kuechly intercepted Palmer's next pass and returned it 22 yards for the final score of the game. While the scoring was over, the turnovers were not, as Palmer was intercepted for the fourth time in the game on the next drive, this time by Boston.\nNewton completed 19 of 32 passes for 335 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, while also rushing for 47 yards and two scores. Brown caught four passes for 113 yards and a touchdown, while Olsen had six receptions for 113 yards. Stewart was the leading rusher of the game with 83 yards. Ginn rushed for 22 yards, caught two passes for 52 yards, and added 38 more yards on two punt returns. Coleman had four tackles and two interceptions, while Kuechly had eight tackles, an interception returned for a touchdown, and a fumble recovery. Boston had a fumble recovery and an interception. Meanwhile, Palmer was badly mauled by the Panthers defense, completing just 23 of 40 passes for 235 yards and a touchdown, while being intercepted four times and losing two fumbles. David Johnson was the team's leading rusher and receiver with 60 rushing yards and nine receptions for 68 yards.\nThis was the most lopsided NFC Championship game since the Giants shut out the Vikings 41–0 in the 2000 NFC Championship Game. Carolina's 49 points set a new record for most points in an NFC Championship Game.\nThis was the second consecutive postseason meeting between the Cardinals and Panthers, and third overall. Both teams have split the previous two meetings. Carolina won last year's meeting 27–16 in the 2014 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nSuper Bowl 50: Denver Broncos 24, Carolina Panthers 10.\nDenver took the opening kickoff and started out strongly. Peyton Manning completed an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina's defense dug in over the next three plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss. Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit.\nAfter each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line, linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton's hands while sacking him, and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown, giving the team a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season.\nAfter a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter. Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line. Despite Denver's excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.\nOn Carolina's next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line. But with 11 seconds left and no timeouts left, Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware causing time for the half to expire.\nThe Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but Trevathan was able to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession.\nThere would be no more scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning's hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano's 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would end in punts.\nWith 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player to attempt a recovery (following Demarcus Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while various angles appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery if he had dived in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and instead tried to drop on top of the ball, which failed. This split second decision later earned him heavy criticism. Meanwhile, Denver's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more drives and managed just one first down between them before the game ended.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Panthers and Broncos."

        "title": "East Asian Games (Japan)",
        "text": "The East Asian Games (, \"Tōa Kyōgi Taikai\"), also known as the Asian Development Games (, \"Kōa Kyōgi Taikai\") were multi-sport events organized by the Japan Association of Athletics Federations (JAAA). The games were meant to be a replacement to the cancelled 1938 Far Eastern Championship Games and 1940 Summer Olympics originally to be hosted by Japan, and also served as a propaganda tool for Japan.\nBackground.\nJapan had been a participant in the Far Eastern Championship Games since its inception and a member of its Far Eastern Athletic Association (FEAA) since 1917. While the aim of the organization was for every East Asian country to join, the attempts made by Japan for Manchukuo to join were rejected by China, who was also a member of the FEAA, leading to the organization's dissolution. Japan and the Philippines established the Oriental Sports Association (, \"Tōyō Taiiku Kyōkai\", OSA), which planned two tournaments, now known as the Oriental Games (, \"Tōyō Senshuken\"): one in Tokyo (1938) and Manila (1942). Both were cancelled as a result of the Second Sino–Japanese War.\nThe Philippines and Manchukuo were drawn back by these series of actions by Japan. Manchukuo formally joined the OSA and the Manchukuo Athletic Association () was created. The Philippines felt resentment for establishing the Oriental Association with the aim of \"peace in the East\". During negotiations with the government, which had promised independence by 1944, it was thought that getting involved in the Oriental Games, which was problematic from an international perspective, would be disadvantageous in future negotiations. On the other hand, Japan was aiming to bid for the 1940 Summer Olympics, and the existence of the OSA would have a disadvantageous effect on the bid for the Olympics. In addition, although there was a movement to allow China into the OSA, no specific offer was made.\nEven after the Tokyo Olympics were officially decided in July 1936, there was no progress toward holding the Olympic Games, such as the difference in interest among sports groups toward the Oriental Games in Japan, China's refusal to join the Oriental Association, and the Philippines' declaration of non-participation in the first Games. On top of this, Manchuria requested participation in the Tokyo Olympics, but was rejected by the Japanese side as it would develop into a political problem.\nWhen the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out on July 7, 1937, Ichirō Kōno, a member of the Imperial Diet, immediately requested that the Olympics be forfeited. Also cancelled were the 1938 Tokyo games, which led to the planning of a new competition. This would culminate in the 1939 tournament between Japan, Manchukuo and China (Nanjing).\nAt that time, Manchukuo and China had a positive view that sports could be effectively used as a diplomatic tool, thus showing enthusiasm for the idea, but since China could not organize a team that could participate in all competitions, it was decided that it would be held as an invitational tournament. The event was to be hosted in Xinjing, with various stadiums being built as part of a National Sports Complex as a result.\nJapan–Manchuria–China Friendship Games.\nThe Japan–Manchuria–China Friendship Games (, \"Nichiman Hana Kōkan Kyōgi Taikai\") began with an opening ceremony on August 31, although weather conditions meant that the competition began the next day. Despite this gesture, the event was marked by terrible weather conditions, as rain poured throughout the tournament.\nThere were four sports: track and field, basketball, volleyball, and soccer. Swimming, baseball, martial arts, gymnastics, and other sports which were popular in Japan, were not implemented. The Manchurian team was particularly excited over baseball, but due to the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League's refusal to participate, the sport did not take place. China did not participate in volleyball, leaving Japan and Manchukuo to play against each other, with the remaining three sports being the only ones to feature all three teams.\nThe focus of this tournament was how well Manchukuo and China could compete against Japan. Soccer was the highlight of the tournament due to North China being a place where soccer flourished. Not only had China won nine consecutive victories in the Far Eastern Championship Games, but in Manchukuo soccer was the national sport, and Japan had strengthened its team by defeating the Swedish team at the Berlin Olympics. As a result, a tough fight was expected.\nIn the end, Japan won both games (being the only scoring team), and there was a brawl in the match between Japan and China. Japan won all the basketball and volleyball games. In track and field, despite the unexpected performance of China, Japan finished first and Manchukuo finished second.\nManchuria was based on the founding principle of \"Five Races Under One Union\" (similar to the Chinese principle), but in this tournament, the Manchurian, Korean, and Caucasian groups were not harmonious as a team, and the Manchurian audience found itself rooting for the Chinese team instead of the Manchurian one. Despite the political use of this tournament, such as the fact that the team was made up of only Chinese players, the results revealed a different reality among the Mainland Chinese.\nIn addition, before and after this tournament, tournaments in which Korea participated in addition to Manchuria and China were held, and from the athletes' side, this tournament was just a part of a series of competitions.\nPrelude to the 1940 Games.\nIn November 1939, the OSA was dissolved and the \"Greater East Asia Athletic Association\" was newly established with the membership of Japan, Manchukuo, the Philippines, China, Thailand, and Burma. Then, in June 1940, it was decided that the \"East Asian Games\" would be held in Japan as a substitute for the cancelled Tokyo Olympics and as part of the celebrations commemorating the 2,600th anniversary of the ascension of Emperor Jimmu and thus, the establishment of the Japanese Empire. Japan is promoted as \"a new position in the East Asia sports system.\" Some sources suggest that this tournament is an advanced version of the 1939 games, being the \"de facto\" Second East Asian Games as a result. It was the first time in ten years since the 9th Far Eastern Championship Games that an international competition was held in Japan.\nOf all the countries that participated in this tournament, which was held twice, Manchukuo, China, and Mengjiang had strong ties with Japan. The Philippines and Hawaii were territories of the United States, but nevertheless Japanese immigrants in Hawaii participated in the tournament.\n1940 East Asian Games.\nThe 1940 East Asian Games (), officially the East Asian Games of the Year 2600 (), were held from 5 to 16 June 1940. 6 different countries participated in the event, with over 700 athletes attending. Besides the participating countries, foreigners residing in Japan (excluding Manchus, Koreans and Chinese) were allowed to participate as \"foreign residents.\"\nThe games were divided between two tournaments: one in Tokyo held from June 5 to 9, 1940, and a second one in Kansai Region, held from June 13 to 16. Besides the regular sports events, demonstrations of archery and Mongolian Sumo were also held. The games were officially declared open by Yasuhito, a younger brother of Hirohito, on June 9, 1940, during the opening ceremony in Meiji Jingu Gaien Stadium in Tokyo.\nSimilar to the games in Berlin, the event was reportedly used by Japan to strengthen inter-Asian relations and to promote its war effort, as seen in articles published at the time, such as one in Issue 121 of the \"Shashin Shūhō\", which referred to the Second Sino–Japanese War as a \"Holy War\" (, \"seisen\").\nAn emblem (and a flag which featured it) was designed for the event, which featured a figure with the numbers \"2600\" overlaid on top of it. The numbers represented the celebration of Emperor Jimmu, but also alluded to the cancelled Olympic event, as the digits' design was reminiscent of that of the Olympic rings.\nJapanese athletes won 10 out of 18 individual track and field events, and Japan took first place in most of the team events. Baseball was described as the most popular sport of the event by \"Asahi Sports\" and \"Sunday Mainichi\". Also highlighted was the rivalry between the Japanese and Philippine teams, who ended first and second place in the tournament, respectively.\nThe Japan national team featured one Korean player, Kim Won-Kwon (), and the Manchuria national team featured players of Japanese and Russian descent.\nSchedule.\nThe following table shows the original schedule, as the baseball and tennis competitions of the Kansai tournament were cancelled due to rain.\n1942 East Asian Games.\nThe 1942 East Asian Games (), officially the East Asian Games of the 10th Anniversary of Manchukuo Celebration (), were held in Xinjing from August 8–11, 1942 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of Manchukuo. Four countries and around 680 athletes participated in the event. A football match between Japan and Korea was played in Keijō on August 16, although this match's relation to the tournament is disputed.\nA winter tournament was also held on February 7–8, 1943, in which Japan and Manchukuo participated with over 70 athletes. A ski competition was held on February 20 and 21 of the same year and was combined with the Kwantung Army's Winter Training Tournament.\nCompared to past competitions, the Manchurian team (although actually Japanese) was more prominent in this competition. The opening ceremony was held in the presence of Emperor Kangde. This tournament was held after the outbreak of the Pacific War."

The national team success led to an increased level of interest in basketball throughout the country as the public eagerly awaited another showdown between the main title contenders — OKK Beograd led by twenty-four-year-old power forward Radivoj Korać and KK Olimpija whose on-court leader was twenty-five-year-old point guard Ivo Daneu.\nNotable events.\nEarly games.\nThe season opened at the outdoor court in Zadar in front of packed stands with 3,500 spectators as the home team, KK Zadar, took on visitors Lokomotiva Zagreb and won 88-78 behind Željko Troskot's 30 points who thus managed to overshadow the Yugoslav national team members on the floor — his Zadar teammate Pino Djerdja as well as Lokomotiva's Džimi Petričević (29 points) and Dragan Kovačić (19 points).\nKK Zadar continued the early part of the season in furious fashion, beating KK Partizan away in Belgrade followed by facing defending champion KK Olimpija away in front of 4,000 fans in Ljubljana — Olimpija (without their injured best player Ivo Daneu) led 51-37 at the half behind Matija Dermastija's scoring before Zadar managed a complete comeback in the second half for a 97-100 final with Djerdja recording 37 points while Dermastija ended up with 29 points.\nIn contrast to Zadar's red hot early form, defending champion Olimpija performed way below expectations due to Daneu's injury absence, recording three losses in their first four games of the season. Olimpija's early-season losses included a 99-90 defeat away at KK Partizan whose sharpshooter Miloš Bojović scored 35 points while Bata Radović added 12.\nClassification.\nThe winning roster of OKK Beograd:\nCoach: Aleksandar Nikolić\nQualification in 1963-64 season European competitions.\nFIBA European Champions Cup"

The original Wynnum club was one of the founding teams of the Brisbane Premiership (now Queensland Premier Rugby) that was formed by the revived Queensland Rugby Union in 1929.\nThe club now plays in the Sunshine Coast Rugby Union competition, after having been in the Brisbane-based QSRU competition for several decades. Wynnum's junior teams play in the Brisbane Junior Rugby Union (BJRU) competition.\nName and colours.\nThe Wynnum Bugs' nickname comes from the Moreton Bay Bug, a species of lobster found in Moreton Bay, near Wynnum. The team's colours are red, white and blue.\nHistory.\nThe original Wynnum Rugby Union Football Club was formed in 1929, and played in the Brisbane Premiership that year.\nIn 1979, the club was refounded when 7-year-old Evan Willis asked his father Jeff \"Willo\" if he could \"\"play the game that they play at Ballymore in Wynnum\".\" When Jeff discovered that there wasn't a rugby union club in Wynnum, his wife Pam and himself starting work to establish the Wynnum Junior Rugby Union Club. The club was based at an old rubbish dump, Elanora Park, on the Foreshore in the north of Wynnum.\nThe \"Wynnum Bugs\" were almost named the \"Wynnum Muddies\". But, the Redlands Rugby Club who were established at a similar time, claimed the \"Muddies\" nickname and the Wynnum club then became known as the \"Moreton Bay Bugs\". \nThe first team to play under the Wynnum Bugs name was an U8's fixture against Ascot-Clayfield on the 11th of April, 1979 and recorded a 20-16 win.\nSince 1979, where the club fielded only a couple junior teams, the Bugs gradually grew throughout the 1980's in teams and playing numbers. In 1989, club president Milton Lovell's efforts to field an under 16s in 1987, the Bugs would field their first ever senior (over 18) side, a Colts under 19s side.\nThe first open age Senior team was assembled in 1990. Wynnum was amongst the inaugural clubs to play in the restructured Queensland Suburban Rugby competition sponsored by Coca-Cola in 1994, and its junior teams played in the Brisbane Junior Rugby Union (BJRU) competition. In The QSRU competition, the Bugs won multiple 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and Colts premierships across this time period. However, the 1st grade was yet to win a premiership, after making multiple grand finals though the 1990s and early 2000s.\nWynnum won the Barber Cup for the QSRU Division I premiership in 2007. The team finished as runner up in 2012 and 2013, The Wynumm Bugs regained the Barber Cup in 2014, defeating Caboolture 45–42 in the grand final at Ballymore. The club also won the Sydney Cup for the QSRU club championship in 2014.\nIn 2018 they defeated Caboolture in the Barber Cup Grand Final before both clubs decided to join the Sunshine Coast Rugby Union competition for the 2019 season.\nThree Wynnum players were selected in the 2022 Sunshine Coast Stingrays squad."

        "text": "The Kayman Sankar Cricket Ground is a sporting venue in Hamptoncourtpolder, a village on the Atlantic coastline of Guyana's Pomeroon-Supenaam region. Its chief use has been as a cricket ground, though in recent years it has also hosted grasstrack motorcycle racing.\nThe ground was developed entirely by Kayman Sankar, a rice farmer who founded the Kayman Sankar Group of Companies and owned large amounts of land near Hampton Court, where his rice mill was located. At his own expense, Sankar \"flew entire teams and reporters to Hampton Court to play four-day and one-day matches\" at the ground, which, as the only major ground in Guyana west of the Essequibo River, was located a good distance from the capital Georgetown and the other major population centres in Demerara and Berbice. Sankar was the first president of the Essequibo Cricket Board (an affiliate of the Guyana Cricket Board), and the Essequibo cricket team first played at his ground during the 1977–78 edition of the inter-county Jones Cup, against Demerara. The ground served as a regular venue for Essequibo until the early 2000s, and the inaugural first-class match played there was the October 1980 final of the Jones Cup, between Essequibo and Berbice. Only the final of that tournament was accorded first-class status, and Essequibo, the weakest of the three counties, made the final only once.\nWith team and media expenses met by Sankar, the ground hosted Shell Shield matches for the Guyanese national side in 1985, 1986, and 1988, and matches in the limited overs Geddes Grant Shield in 1988 and 1989. The ground was used regularly for Guyana's one-day matches during the 1990s, with at least one match played there every year from 1994 to 1998 (two matches were played during both the 1994–95 and 1996–97 seasons). Its last major matches came during the 2004–05 season – a first-class match against the Leeward Islands and a one-day game against the Windward Islands. A number of well-known West Indies international players played for their respective national teams at the ground during the 1990s, including Ian Bishop, Brian Lara (both Trinidad and Tobago), Joel Garner (Barbados), Carl Hooper (Guyana), and Richie Richardson (Leeward Islands). Although the venue is no longer used for high-level cricket in Essequibo, with a ground in Anna Regina being preferred, it has more recently hosted several meets for the National Grasstrack Racing Club (NGRC)."

The cup had been damaged when the crowd invaded the pitch in the first \"test\".\nAftermath.\nThe 1909 side was the first to wear a kiwi emblem on their uniforms. The New Zealand national side is now called the Kiwis.\nSquad.\nOnly 19 players were involved in the squad, with a maximum of 18 available for selection at any one time. Seventeen travelled with the main party, however Nirai Whareure broke his collarbone after the first match. Tohe Herangi joined the touring party after the first match and Hone Tuki arrived in time for the first 'test' match.\nMākereti (Maggie) and Murai (Bella) Papakura and two Māori chiefs travelled with the side.

        "title": "Minnesota State Junior Boys' Golf Championship",
        "text": "The Minnesota State Junior Boys’ Golf Championship is an annual tournament conducted by the Minnesota Golf Association (MGA) to determine the state golf champion for boys less than 19 years of age. While the MGA traces the tournament back to 1924 (the 2014 event was billed as the 88th annual), the lineage to that first tournament is circuitous. Over the years, the state junior golf championship has encompassed four independently sponsored and differently named statewide tournaments with intervals during which two of the tournaments have overlapped.\nThe first iteration of the state junior championship was established by the MGA and conducted from 1924-1935. Known as the Minnesota Junior Golf Tournament, the first winner was Lester Bolstad. In 1931, the St. Paul Voiture of the American Legion Forty and Eight Veterans Organization sponsored a similar, if competing, statewide tournament called the Forty and Eight State Junior Golf Tournament. The two tournaments were played until 1935 after which the MGA discontinued its state championship.\nThe Forty and Eight State Junior Tournament distinguished itself from its MGA rival in that it saw greater participation – and success – among non-Minneapolis and St. Paul metro golfers. From 1934 to 1937, the tournament was won consecutively by out-state competitors. Except for the World War II years of 1943-1944 during which the tournament was not played, the Forty and Eight State Junior Tournament continued through 1945. However, in 1946, the Forty and Eight organization ended its sponsorship resulting in no state junior golf tournament for that year.\nAfter a one-year pause, the Minnesota Junior Chamber of Commerce assumed sponsorship of the tournament. The renamed Minnesota Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament was first played in 1947. The Minnesota Jaycee Junior was different from its predecessors in that players not only competed for the state title, but also to qualify for the International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament – one of the major junior golf tournaments at the time.\nAt the height of the Minnesota Jaycee Junior’s popularity and 25 years since ending the original Minnesota Junior Golf Tournament, the Minnesota Golf Association began the MGA Junior Golf Championship in 1961. The MGA Junior format included both individual and team competitions in which the best three of four scores of each round counted toward four-man team scoring. Four golfers - Ron Benson, Gary Rodin, Jon Chaffee, and Bill Israelson - won both the Minnesota Jaycee Junior and the MGA Junior.\nIn 1969, unable to find financial backing for the International Jaycee Junior Tournament, the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce ended the International. While state and local Jaycee Junior competitions continued in Minnesota, a significant draw for the state Jaycee Junior tournament was lost with the termination of the International. Consequently, by the mid-70s, the growth and expansion of the MGA Junior Golf Championship eclipsed that of the Minnesota Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament and, after the 1975 event, the state Jaycee Junior was abandoned. \nThe MGA Junior Golf Championship – the surviving tournament of the four state golf championships – continues to this day. In 2002, the MGA renamed the tournament to the Minnesota State Junior Boys’ Championship and its winner represents the state of Minnesota as its junior golf champion.\nWinners.\nMinnesota Junior Golf Tournament (1924-1935)\nForty and Eight State Junior Golf Tournament (1931-1945)\nMinnesota Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament (1947-1975)\nMGA Junior Golf Championships (1961-2001)\nMinnesota State Junior Boys' Golf Championship (2002-Present)"

        "title": "Willie Simmons (American football)",
        "text": "Willie Simmons (born October 12, 1980) is an American college football coach and former quarterback. He is the running backs coach at Duke University. He was the head football coach at Florida A&amp;M from 2018 to 2023 and Prairie View A&amp;M from 2014 to 2017. He has also served as offensive coordinator of the Alcorn State Braves as well as the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders football teams. Simmons played college football at Clemson and The Citadel as a quarterback.\nEarly life.\nWillie Román Simmons was born in Tallahassee, Florida, to Willie and Phyllis Simmons. He is the youngest of three children and the only son. He was an All-American quarterback (ranked #10 quarterback nationally) at James A. Shanks High School after leading the Tigers to their first district championship in 22 years and being named Big Bend Offensive Player of the Year after throwing for 2,505 yards and 32 touchdowns. He received over 25 scholarship offers, and after narrowing his college choices down to Florida State, Clemson, Georgia Tech, Syracuse, and Miami, he signed a National Letter of Intent to attend Clemson to play for former head coach Tommy Bowden. Simmons lettered three years at Clemson (2000–2002) and participated in four bowl games (Peach, Gator, Humanitarian, and Tangerine). Simmons earned his Bachelor of Science degree in services (sports) marketing from Clemson in the spring of 2002, just 3 years after he enrolled, which is the fastest any football player has ever graduated from the university. He initially transferred to Florida A&amp;M University in Tallahassee, FL for his senior season, but after being deemed ineligible to compete because FAMU was in provisional status as a Division I-A (now FBS) program, he enrolled at The Citadel, where he garnered All Southern Conference First Team honors after leading the Bulldogs to a 6–6 record (their first non-losing season in 10 years). The Bulldogs also accomplished a feat that had only been done by Marshall, which was defeat Furman, Appalachian State, and Georgia Southern in the same season. After Simmons' college career, he played one season of arena football in the United Indoor Football League for the Sioux City Bandits, where he played alongside future NFL running back Fred Jackson.\nCoaching career.\nSimmons began his coaching career in 2005 at Lincoln High School in Tallahassee, Florida, where he coached the quarterbacks and was also the pass game coordinator. There, he had the opportunity to coach former NFL and South Florida Bulls quarterback B.J. Daniels. After one season, he was brought back to his alma mater Clemson as a graduate assistant coach, working with the quarterbacks.\nMiddle Tennessee State.\nAfter one season at Clemson, Simmons was offered the position of running backs coach at Middle Tennessee State by head coach Rick Stockstill, who recruited Simmons to Clemson. Entering the 2010 season, after three seasons as the running backs coach, Simmons was promoted to Pass Game Coordinator. The following season, he was promoted to offensive coordinator. At the age of 30, he was one of the youngest coordinators at the FBS level. During his time as offensive coordinator, the Blue Raiders were ranked 20th nationally in total offense, while leading the Sun Belt Conference in total offense, rushing offense, and third-down conversion percentage, and ranking second in passing offense.\nAlcorn State.\nSimmons accepted a position on newly hired Jay Hopson's staff at Alcorn State in the summer of 2012. They inherited a program that had only won 2 games the previous season. Starting a true freshman quarterback and without spring practice, the Braves finished with a 4–7 record, highlighted by wins over previous Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) champion Grambling State and #1 ranked Alabama A&amp;M. The 2013 season saw the Braves and Simmons' offense finish 9–3 overall (7–2 in the SWAC) and ranked #5 in the final SBN Black College Football Poll (its highest ranking ever at the time). Simmons coached running back Arnold Walker to a career year as he led the conference in rushing (1,191 yards) and touchdowns (16), became the school's all-time leading rusher, and was voted SWAC Co-Offensive Player of the Year. Simmons' offense finished the season ranked in the Top 25 nationally in total offense, rushing offense, and scoring offense. 2014 was an even better year for Simmons and the Braves, as they won the Southwestern Athletic Conference Championship over Southern University, as well as being named Black College National Champions. The Braves' offense set many records that season, as they finished second nationally in scoring offense, 8th in total offense, and 4th in rushing offense. Quarterback John Gibbs, Jr, was selected as SWAC Co-Offensive Player of the Year and Black College Player of the Year, giving Simmons two consecutive Player of the Year selections.\nPrairie View A&amp;M.\nOn December 16, 2014, Simmons was named the 32nd head football coach at Prairie View A&amp;M University. The Panthers were picked to finish 3rd in the SWAC Western Division in the pre-season polls. Due to previous APR sanctions, the Panthers were not allowed to participate in spring practice. Despite this, Simmons' inaugural season saw Prairie View A&amp;M finish with an 8–2 overall record (their win over the University of Faith was vacated by the NCAA because Faith did not meet accreditation requirements) and 8–1 conference record. The Panthers finished the season with the top-scoring offense in the nation (44.9 points per game) and ranked 8th in total offense. They also finished the season ranked 3rd in the SBN Black College Football Poll. Simmons became the first first-year head football coach at Prairie View A&amp;M since 1966 to have a winning record in his inaugural season, and the Panthers' 9 wins were tied for the most at Prairie View A&amp;M since 1964. In 2016, Prairie View A&amp;M finished with a 7-4 record and followed up with a 6–5 record in 2017. The 2017 season marked the 3rd consecutive winning season under Simmons, only the second time in fifty years that the PVAMU Panthers had three consecutive winning seasons.\nFlorida A&amp;M.\nOn December 12, 2017, Simmons was named the 18th head football coach at Florida A&amp;M University. The storied Rattlers program had fallen on tough times, as it was fresh off a seven-year losing streak. In his first season at the helm, Simmons led FAMU to a second-place finish in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, finishing one win away from winning its first MEAC championship since 2011. The team's 6-5 overall record ended the losing streak, and their 22-21 come-from-behind victory on the road over the eventual conference and Black College National Champion North Carolina A&amp;T was the highlight of the season. The 2019 season was Simmons’ best to date as the Rattlers finished the season with a 9-2 overall record (7-1 conference) and ranked #21 in the final FCS polls. Quarterback Ryan Stanley was named MEAC Offensive Player of the Year and rewrote the FAMU record books, leaving as the school’s all-time leader in passing yards, passing attempts, completions, and passing touchdowns. Due to a self-imposed one-year postseason ban, Florida A&amp;M was not able to be named conference champions and was ineligible for the Air Force Reserves Celebration Bowl.\nFlorida A&amp;M opted out of competition for the 2020 season due to COVID-19. They resumed the 2021 season as the newest member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) after 35+ years in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC). That season saw FAMU finish with a 9-3 overall record (7-1 conference), ranked in the final FCS polls (#24) and the school's first FCS playoff appearance since 2001. Junior edge rusher Isaiah Land led the nation in sacks (19) and tackles for loss (25.5) and won the Buck Buchanan Award as the best defensive player in FCS. FAMU's defense finished the season ranked in the top 10 nationally in most statistical categories and four players earned All-American recognition, led by Land and All-American Safety Markquese Bell. Bell would later become the first FAMU football player in over 8 years to make an NFL roster (Dallas Cowboys). The 2022 season saw FAMU start the season 0-2, but then go on a 6-game winning streak. Simmons earned his 50th career win as a head coach when the Rattlers defeated Grambling St. on October 15, 2022. The Rattlers currently have the nation's second-longest home win streak at 19 games.\nPersonal life.\nSimmons is married to the former Shaia René Beckwith (also a Quincy native) who is a two time graduate of Florida A&amp;M University . They have six children (Louis III, Amerie, Raven, Shailoh, Wraylon, and Truth). Simmons' father was a well-respected mechanic in the small city of Quincy, Florida where they resided, until a work related accident took his life in 1987 when Willie was six years old. Simmons' mother was a staunch supporter of academic excellence and an accomplished math teacher in the Gadsden County School District for 28 years until chronic renal failure forced her to retire. Willie once earned a ‘C’ grade in middle school and his mother threatened to not let him touch a football again. She died in 2005. He was given the nickname \"Shotgun\" by his high school game announcer for his strong arm and quick release."

        "text": "Tom Bayley Sanders (born 5 February 1994) is a New Zealand rugby union player who currently plays as a loose forward for in New Zealand's domestic Mitre 10 Cup and the Crusaders in the international Super Rugby competition. He also plays as a Number 8 position.\nEarly career.\nBorn in Christchurch and raised in the small town of Little River, Sanders attended Lincoln High School in the city of his birth, where he played first XV rugby for 3 years and was a member of the New Zealand Schools academy during that time. He initially played his rugby as a midfielder, but later in his teens switched to loose forward.\nAfter graduating high school, he began studying for a Bachelor of Commerce in Agricultural Management at Lincoln University while also representing them in the local Canterbury club leagues.\nSenior career.\nSanders started out his senior career with Canterbury during the 2014 ITM Cup, making his debut against in Week 1 of the competition. He had to settle for a place on the replacements bench most weeks but did come on to good effect and scored 3 tries in 8 appearances during the season. He played 10 times in 2015, rotating the starting duties with Reed Prinsep as Canterbury lifted the Premiership title with a 25–23 victory over in the final. Injury held him back in the early part of 2016, but he bounced back to start 7 times and score 1 try to help Canterbury to their 8th national provincial championship title in 9 seasons.\nSuper Rugby.\nHis displays in his first year of provincial rugby didn't go unnoticed and he was named as a member of the wider training group for the 2015 Super Rugby season. It was largely a season of learning for Sanders, as the presence of All Black stalwarts such as Kieran Read and Richie McCaw in the Crusaders back row meant that he didn't see any game time.\nHis continued good work in New Zealand's domestic rugby competitions saw him named in the squad in 2016. He scored 3 tries in 13 appearances during his first year in Hamilton as his new side reached the tournament's semi-finals before going down to New Zealand rivals, and eventual champions the in Wellington.

        "title": "Tweener (tennis)",
        "text": "The tweener or between-the-legs shot (also known as a hotdog) is a difficult tennis shot where a player hits the ball between his or her legs. It is typically performed facing away from the opponent, when the player attempts to recover a lob and has no time to turn back around, and hits the ball backward between their legs. Forward-facing tweeners, sometimes called \"front tweeners\", are also occasionally employed. In competitive matches the tweener is a crowd-pleasing, seldom used last resort, but it is a common trick shot in exhibitions. Players who famously executed the backward shot include the pioneer Guillermo Vilas (whose version was called the \"Gran Willy\"), Yannick Noah, Ilie Năstase, Gabriela Sabatini (whose version became known as \"the Sabatweenie\"), Juan Carlos Ferrero, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Juan Martín del Potro, Nick Kyrgios, Daria Kasatkina, Agnieszka Radwańska, Simona Halep, Ons Jabeur, and Novak Djokovic.\nHistory.\nThe first tennis player to study and develop this shot was Argentine Guillermo Vilas. Vilas was inspired by an advertisement where Juan Carlos Harriot, a famous polo player during the '70s, hit a backwards shot between his horse's hind legs. He debuted his version in a 1974 exhibition match at the courts of Club Obras Sanitarias in Buenos Aires against the French player Wanaro N'Godrella. One year later, in 1975, he hit this shot for the very first time during an official ATP match in Indianapolis Championship against the Spaniard player Manuel Orantes; the shot became known as \"Gran Willy\" (\"the great willy\") after him. Romanian Ilie Năstase, who pioneered a backward over-the-shoulder shot known as the \"Bucharest Backfire\", also executed the backward tweener during the late '70s.\nIn the 1980s, players employing the backward tweener shot included the French player Yannick Noah, German player Boris Becker, the Swede Stefan Edberg, and Argentine Gabriela Sabatini, whose version became known as \"the Sabatweenie\". American Andre Agassi used it in the 1990s. In the 21st century, Swiss player Roger Federer hit tweeners on several notable occasions, further popularizing the shot. He successfully hit a backward tweener for a winner to give himself match point in the 2009 US Open semifinal, which he called \"the greatest shot I ever hit in my life.\" Federer has also used front-facing tweeners on several occasions. Hubert Hurkacz, who defeated Federer in the quarterfinals of the 2021 Wimbledon tournament, has had his tweener described as \"one of the flashiest on tour\" by Christopher Clarey of \"The New York Times\". A high jump front-facing tweener was also notably executed by Mary Pierce during the quarter-finals of the 2000 French Open."

They are not regulated by the Royal Dutch Cycling Union.\nThe Championships take place on the Oosterscheldekering storm barrier, which faces the North Sea, and have been held in fall or winter since 2013. Competitors must ride the 8.5 km course against the wind on upright single-speed bicycles, which are provided by the organization. The championships are announced three days before a storm is expected. Since 2014 there is also a team time trial. A total of 200 individual cyclists (300 cyclists in 2020) can participate, plus 25 teams of four cyclists. Participants start 30 seconds apart from each other and the one with the fastest time wins.\nIn 2020 both the male and female reigning champions (from 2018) successfully defended their titles. In 2023 the event was cancelled because of heavy storm."

        "title": "University of Oregon rowing team",
        "text": "The University of Oregon Rowing Team is located in Eugene, Oregon, and practices at Dexter Reservoir nearby. The team was founded in 1967 and has operated continuously under the guidance of the University. At Oregon, men's and women's teams practice together and compete against other teams regionally and nationally in a number of regattas each year. Even before the passage of Title IX in 1972, the team received national attention for Coach Don Costello's controversial use of female coxswain Victoria Brown in crew, in a previously all-male sport.\nSince 2011, the team has raced annually at the end of May in the American Collegiate Rowing Association (ACRA) National Championship.\nThe University of Oregon Boathouse is located next to the Oregon Association of Rowers (O.A.R.) at Dexter Reservoir. Each year, O.A.R. hosts the Covered Bridge Regatta which is the home regatta for both programs. In 2013, Dexter Lake was named one of the top racing venues in the United States by Row2k.\nHistory.\n1967–1972: The Founding Crew, Don McCarty, and Victoria Brown.\nEfforts to build a rowing program at Oregon reappeared in 1967 under the direction of university administrators Don McCarty and Ken Abbey and a founding crew of twenty-two oarsmen.\nOregon State Head Coach Karl Drlica loaned two rowing shells, and McCarty rented a number of shells from Stanford coach Conn Findlay, at cost of $1500 per year.\nBy 1969 the Oregon Rowers regularly competed in varsity races. The Register-Guard reported, \"the University of Oregon had officially elevated crew to varsity status on a one-year provisional basis making it the 10th intercollegiate sport at the school.\"\nInitially an all men's group, because of Oregon's mixed status it was exempt from the new regulations of Title IX in 1972. Despite this, the Oregon Women's Crew was founded in 1973 and the team received significant national attention surrounding coxswain Victoria Brown, one of the first female coxswains to compete in men's collegiate rowing. Traditionally, men's crews relied on male coxswains, and Brown's presence on the Oregon team stirred controversy.\n1973–1980: Oregon's First Women's Crew.\n1973 marked an important year for the Ducks because it was then University-sponsored women's rowing. Ralph Neils and Marti Abts had taken over for the men's and women's programs with Mike Napier and Bill Lioio as assistant coaches.\nAccording to the Register-Guard, \"The $350 spent on Oregon's first women's crew this year was apparently well spent. The U of O lightweights finished second to Washington in the recent Northwest championships in Seattle. And so did a heavyweight pair, Zanne Pratt and Debbie [Sprecher].\"\nIn the next season, Reed Adler took over as men's coach for the Ducks, and he was followed by Chuck Knoll in 1976. Coach Brian Cole entered the 1968 Long Beach Rowing Trials, finishing two spots shy of an Olympic berth and earning a bronze medal.\nBetween 1976 and 1980, the Oregon Women's Crew grew. Paul Schultz (Ithaca College '77) coached for two years, amazed at the strength, size and talent that showed up for rowing in the fall of '77. An over-six-foot Olympic-level skier whose career-ending injury on the slopes landed her at five and a woman reflecting her drive at six, there was a boat that won on Green Lake (tho- disqualified for a lane violation) and won in Corvallis. They were all novices, rowing against varsities and JVs, including were Carolyn McCloskey (rowed in high school) and Robin Riordan (rowed in the Pan-Am Games a few years later).\nThe Oregon Daily Emerald noted, \"The University of Oregon varsity crew came up with two surges to hand Oregon State University a defeat... on Dexter Lake Saturday. With Lance Baughman at stroke and Russ Ward at coxswain, the Ducks held the Beaver eight, composed entirely of heavyweights (160 pounds and up) at bay over the remainder of the estimated 2,200-meter course, crossing the finish line in 7 minutes flat to 7:05 for OSU.\"\n1980 to 1988: Our first owned shells, the emergence of the lightweight dominance and a National Championship.\nIn 1980, the men and women's crew was coached by Lance Baughman and competed in many of the traditional west coast races. The men competed at the Pac 10 championship at Redwood Shores in a Freshman 8, Lightweight 8 and an Open 4. Most notable, the men's Freshman 8 broke a rigger disabling the shell at about the exact same time MT. ST. Helens erupted.\nIn 1981, the women were not able to field a team and the men fielded a Lightweight 8 and an Open 4. Lee Wilder coached the men's team and was one of the 1st women coaches of a men's team in NCAA history. The men's Open 4 took 3rd at the Pac 10 Championship with Dane Nickerson at stroke, Joe Meier at 3, Ted Kraines at 2 and Jeff Levikow at Bow.\n1982 was a step change in the U of O Crew History. Based on a large contingent of new recruits, the crew was able to field both a women's and men's teams. Under the guidance of Lori Huseth as head coach and the rowers, 1982 brought many 1sts for the team. For spring break, the team traveled to LA to practice and scrimmage against UCLA and USC. The year started ominously when our old bus was T-boned by another car while on its 1st trip from the physical plant to the daily parking spot at Hayward Field. Being creative, the team took the insurance settlement along with fundraisers to purchase a new Pocock fiberglass 4 and 8 carbon graphite oars. The team did not have a trailer and used the top of the bus to transport the new shell. We later christened the shell the D.B. McCarty at Dexter with coach McCarty in attendance. With the new 4, a shell we were familiar with, victories started to pile up on each race. The team also realized that it was tough to compete in traditional 8 races but in the fours we were very competitive for both the men and women. Epic practice scrimmages were held between the Light 4 and the Open 4 with many times the light 4 winning. The team then would combine both 4s to make our varsity 8.\nAt the Portland Regatta, The Ducks won every race entered. This included a 2 shell open water deficit at the start of the men's varsity 8 when our 4 man lost his seat and caught a crab. He quickly got everything back in place and the crew powered back into the race with the coxswain calling out the deficit rather negative at start and then becoming more positive and screaming excitement as the crew powered by all crews to win going away. The Oregon Journal published the photo at the finish.\nAt the Northwest Regionals, the lightweight 4 (Jim Petrosich at stroke, Tim Meier at 3, Scott Chestnut at 2 and Kirk Krasheul at bow with Brenda Thornton at cox) and heavyweight 4 overtook \"all twelve of their competitors in the preliminary heats... to win the Championship in each of those events. For the first time in the crew team's history, they beat the Huskies in a varsity rowing event [!]\" The women took silver in their light 4. The men's Open 4 qualified to compete for a spot in the National Sports Festival. Despite the light 4's win and faster time at Regionals, there was not a Light 4 event at the Festival.\nThe men's Open 4 western race was set as a duel between UCLA to be held at Redwood Shores.\nLeading up to the final race of the season against a dominant and undefeated UCLA boat, the crew earned the nickname Cinderella.\nIn an article titled, \"It's an unlikely row to anywhere,\" the Register-Guard reported, \"The key to the success of the four seems to be Hugh Watson, the 32-year-old Australian... 'I was rowing before Sietske (Folkens) was born,' said [stroke seat] Watson. [In addition, Sietske Folkens] rows No. 2. The No. 3 man is John Bigelow... the bow is Bryan Andressen... and the coxswain is Brenda Thornton.\"\nHugh Watson sought out the help of graduate school dean and University vice-provost Dick Hersh. \"Hersh... was an old-timer in the world of competitive rowing. After four years on the Syracuse crew, Hersh had been coxswain on the U.S. team at the 1966 world championships in Yugoslavia. He then coached at Harvard and coached two of seven Olympic rowing teams at Mexico City in 1968.\" When Watson approached him, Hersh was skeptical, \"I think he thought that nobody in Oregon could be competitive on a national level. He came out for one row and was surprised at our standard. He's been out for every row since.\" Hersh explained, \"I told them that I felt I could make them six or seven seconds faster than they were, and that they needed to do 2,000 meters in six minutes, forty five seconds to beat UCLA. Well, they did six forty-six and won.\"\n\"Oregon crew out-rows UCLA,\" The Register-Guard reported, \"The University of Oregon crew team beat UCLA in a dual race Saturday to qualify for the National Sports Festival in Indianapolis, Ind., July 23–27\", adding, \"The Ducks completed the 2,000 meter course in 6:46.3. UCLA finished in 6:50.3\".\nHugh Watson said, \"They were a lot bigger than us, and certainly more experienced. It was quite an upset. It is the most remarkable thing the Oregon crew has ever won.\" The Ducks were just shy of a medal against \"five larger teams from schools that offer rowing scholarships, and four teams from the national Olympic camp.\"\nIn 1983, Mike Holcomb took over as coach for both the men's and women's team. Pursuing a loan from the Student Union, the team was able to purchase our 1st 8. Due to lack of trailer, the shell was able to be split into 2 halves and be transported on top of our bus. At the Northwest Regionals in Seattle, we were able to officially christen the shell the Victoria Brown. Victoria was the 1st woman coxswain of a men's crew in NCAA history. The team continued to win many races with our new equipment and had a heated rivalry with OSU's light men's 4 that heated up with the Oregon Crew being cut off by another OSU light 4 crew at the Corvallis regatta. Oregon protested and it was agreed by both coaches that the medals for both races would be settled at the Tri-Cities Regatta the following week. The Daily Barometer, which was OSU's student paper reported the OSU team was seeking their revenge on the Ducks. With 3 lengths of open water at the finish, Oregon smashed the Beavers at WSU.\nIn 1984, Mike Holcomb coached the men and Tim Meier Coached the women's team. The women's team had a great year in winning many races in both the novice 8 and 4, lightweight 8 and 4. At the Tri-Cities regatta, OSU only beat Oregon by 1 point in the team standings. The Lightweight women won the Pac 10's in Sacramento and came in second at the National Collegiate Championship in Seattle. 3 Oregon women (Gayle Johnson, Teresa Hukari and Marge Kuenne) from the lightweight 8 were invited to train all summer in Seattle for the World Championships in Montreal. Gayle Johnson's 4 took 6th in her event.\n1n 1985, Mike Holcomb coached the men and women's team. the lightweight women's team continued their dominance by winning the Pac 10's and placing second in the National Collegiate Rowing Championships.\nIn a June 4, 1985 article The Register-Guard reported: \"In the best finish ever for a University of Oregon crew team, the women's 'lightweight eight' team finished second Sunday in the Women's National Collegiate Rowing Championships. The Oregon unit, coached by Mike Holcomb, lost to Radcliffe, which covered the 1,750 meter course in 5:48.6. Oregon's team clocked 6:08.1... The Oregon crew was Robin Hendricks, Julie Martinson, Teresa Bujacich, Sasha Stone, Margie Bernards, Gayle Johnson, Cate Renfrew, Teresa Hukari and coxswain Lisa Woodworth.\"\nIn 1986, Dave Baugh coached the women's team and they again won the Pac 10s and took home the gold medal at the Women's National Collegiate Rowing Championship. The 1st NCAA championship for the Oregon. Teresa Hukari stroke, Kris Sternberg, Sasha Stone, Teresa Bujacich, Kitty O'Doherty, Marge Kuehn, Gayle Johnson, Robin Hendricks and Lisa Woodward - cox.\n1986–1991: Jeff Moag and Marty Billingsley.\nSasha Stone join the coaching staff in 1988.\nJeff Moag was the team's coach in 1990–1991. Coach Moag said Marty Billingsley's time was \"comparable to the times of rowers in other categories, not only the best in the master's division but among the world's top times.\" He added, \"It's probably a top 10 finish out of everybody in the world.\" She was Oregon's first World Champion (Indoor) Rower.\n1991–1996: Crews under Emerich, Borton, and Busse.\nMorgan Emrich coached from 1992 to 1993, Joe Borton coached from 1993 to 1994, and Phil Busse from 1994 to 1996. Susan Belcher and James Mcqueen were assistant coaches in these years.\nThe Oregon Daily Emerald reported in June 1993, \"The men's lightweight team of the crew will compete for the national championship June 11 and 12, in East Fork State Park in Cincinnati Ohio\", and added, \"Oregon defeated some of the top teams in the west, including California and Cal-Davis. Oregon must now face Ivy League powerhouses Harvard, Princeton and Dartmouth in the national competition.\" Despite defeat at the 1993 national championship, the lightweight four had a near perfect season in 1994 winning every race except for their last. The other strong boat in 1994 was the women's novice 8+. Their boat finished third out of sixteen competitors at the Northwest Regional Championship with a time of 7:19.5.\nThe Oregon Daily Emerald wrote, \"the Oregon men's and women's crew teams made a mockery of the competition on Saturday, taking home first place in all but one of their eight divisional races\".\nThe Oregon Daily Emerald also reported, \"Aided by a stiff tail wind, the men's novice four team upset the No. 1-ranked Washington squad by a half second in the day's closest race. It was a crushing defeat for the Huskies who had been undefeated much of the year. Coach Phil Busse remarked, 'It was just a great day for the whole Oregon team, the men's novice four race was very exciting and worked out well for us.' \"\n1997–2001: Crews under Holmes, Gerlach, and Neron.\nIn 1996-1997 two crews went to Opening Day Regatta at the University of Washington. The men's boat finished fourth of seven. The women's boat was disqualified after hitting a buoy and breaking a rigger. Holmes said, \"I had no idea what to expect from that race, but they were winning at that point.\"\nThe Oregon Daily Emerald reported in 1999 that the university was considering upgrading women's crew to intercollegiate status, in order to comply with Title IX. \"Such a move has generated mixed feelings in team members and coaches, who say varsity status can be as much a curse as it is a blessing\", and added, \"Many women on the team now wouldn't make the cut on varsity.\"\n2002–2007: Athletic Department Overlooks Rowing.\nIn the fall of 2002 Coach Chris Peters said he was attracted to the Oregon program because the university had, \"potential to be a good rowing school. It has a lot of students, it's a large school and it's in the Pac-10.\" Peters left after one season.\nIn February 2003 the Register-Guard reported on the potential for a varsity rowing program at Oregon, following an announcement by the University of Oregon that, \"lacrosse will be the school's new women's varsity sport\", which, \"sent waves crashing through the hopes and dreams of some members of the local rowing community.\"\nYasmin Farooq, a local volunteer coach for the O.A.R. master's program and a former NCAA Champion (1986), World Champion (1995), Olympian (1992, 1996) as a coxswain, said, \"It's so mind-blowing to me that Oregon failed to see the potential right in front of them. You put a great coach on that lake, with the athletes that are available in this area alone, and within five years you could have a national champion.\" Adding, \"When I moved out here (in 1996) and saw Dexter Lake, I had to pinch myself, I've raced on some of the best water in the world and I can tell you, Dexter is in the top five in the nation, and easily the best on the West Coast if you consider climate.\"\nAccording to Oregon associate athletic director Renee Mack Baumgartner, the senior women's administrator for the athletic department, many variables factored into the decision for women's lacrosse. Surveys of the team revealed \"women's crew team did not want to be separated from the men's crew team\". Additionally, Baumgartner said, \"Dexter Reservoir is 21½ miles from campus, while the lacrosse team will play on the field in front of the Casanova Center.\" Cost was also an issue: \"Oregon figures show a $270,000 difference in yearly budget estimates ($530,000 for a fully funded lacrosse program, $800,000 for crew), and estimate a $4.17 million start-up cost that would include construction of a boat house at Dexter Reservoir and the purchase of boats.\"\nBaumgartner said, \"Oregon wants to be competitive immediately. California, Stanford, Denver and Saint Mary's College are the only Division I women's lacrosse teams west of the Mississippi River... Crew, on the other hand, is already established at every Pac-10 school except Oregon, Arizona State and Arizona. [Adding] it would have taken a significant amount of time to be competitive.\" Baumgartner concluded, \"I think in the future we will look back and say that we were proactive, we had the big picture and picked the right sport.\" Farooq responded, \"They may win conference championships with lacrosse, but they would have won national championships with rowing.\"\nDespite these success the team began to decline. In 2006, The Emerald reported, \"Duck rowers race at Dexter Lake\", and \"membership in the Crew has declined going into the busy spring season despite starting the year with a large roster\".\n2008–2013: Carly Schmidt and ACRA.\nIn the fall of 2008, Athletics Director Sandy Vaughn discovered that the rowers had been practicing without a coach. The team found Carly Schmidt, who coached until the end of spring 2013. Under Schmdt, the program attended the American Collegiate Rowing Association (ACRA) National Championships for the first time in 2011. The 2011 team won two medals, a bronze in the women's varsity 4+ and a silver in the men's 1x. In the following two seasons, Schmidt's squads were able to place two more boats in the top 10 at the ACRA championships.\nThree articles, titled, \"All Aboard,\" \"Rowers respond,\" and \"Closer than They Appear,\" reported on the team over the 2010 season.\n2014–2017: Kindorf Leads the Ducks.\nIn the 2013–2014 season under Marlene Kindorf, the team made a number of equipment upgrades through $50,000 in fundraising and donation. That season, the team sent four boats to the ACRA national championships, including a women's novice 8 that placed second in the event. This was just the third medal the program had ever won at the ACRA championships, and the first in an 8+ event in any category.\nOver the next four years as head coach, Kindorf's boats would win four more medals, including the program's first ACRA gold medal in the women's novice 4 in 2016. In total, the team finished the four-year stretch with nine top-5 finishes at the ACRA national championships. Prior to Kindorf's tenure as head coach, the program had placed in the top 5 only twice.\nAfter six years with the team as an assistant and head coach, and significant national success, Marlene Kindorf abruptly stepped down from her role following the 2017 season.\nOregon Rowing celebrated its 50th anniversary in September 2017.\n2020: Pandemic Poses Challenges.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced a cancellation of the fall 2020 season, and the team was forced to practice with just one rower in each boat.\nCovered Bridge Regatta.\nThe Oregon Association of Rowers (O.A.R.) began working to construct a boathouse at Dexter Lake in 1984 with the support of a $3000 US Rowing Grant. After nine years the boathouse was completed in 1993. The group then organized and hosted its first Covered Bridge Regatta in 1995.\nThe event traditionally takes place in the middle of April and offers three levels of competition: Masters, Collegiate, and Juniors. The event's namesake, the Lowell Covered Bridge, sits approximately 100 meters from the starting line of a 2,000 meter course running down to a finish line adjacent to the UO/OAR Boathouses. There is a dock which extends out along the course allowing for spectators at the 1,500 meter mark. In 2008 the OAR Masters completed the construction of a $70,000 buoyed course at Dexter. In 2013, Dexter was named one of the ten best race courses in the country.\nIn 2014, for its 20th anniversary, the event hosted, \"Five hundred junior, collegiate and master rowers from 36 teams competed in 44 events\" over two days. In 2015, the event is separating into two weekends: Collegiate Covered Bridge on April 11, and Covered Bridge Regatta (Masters/Juniors) on April 18–19."

        "text": "Joseph Stuart Clements (July 14, 1936 – May 4, 2015) was an American football player and coach. As head football coach of at Huntsville High School in Huntsville, Texas from 1975 to 1994, he became the only person to lead a single Texas high school to the state championship as both a player and a coach. He was the starting quarterback for the University of Texas Longhorns from 1955 to 1956. Clements died on Monday, May 4, 2015.\nEarly life.\nAs a high school quarterback, Clements led Huntsville to the 1953 AA Texas State Championship. With him as quarterback, Huntsville went 28–1 over the 1952–53 seasons. He was a top recruit coming out of high school, and chose to go to Texas, where his father Otto had been a two-time all-Southwest Conference baseball player.\nCollege football.\nClements started his sophomore year at Texas as the back-up quarterback to Walter Fondren. But, in the second game of the year, he replaced an ineffective Fondren and had the best game of his career. He threw for 215 yards and three touchdowns in the game, becoming the second Longhorn to ever throw for more than 200 yards in a single game and tying the school record for touchdown passes in a game. Going into the next game, he was the nation's leading passer. He started every game for Texas for the next two years. Against USC the following week, he was knocked out in the first five minutes and replaced by Walter Fondren and third-string quarterback Dick Miller. Texas went on to post a 5–5 record with losses to number 8 USC, number 3 Oklahoma and number 7 TCU, but finished the season on an up-note when they upset rival number 8 Texas A&amp;M. That year, he led the Southwest Conference in interceptions.\nClements remained the starter in 1956 and he led the Southwest Conference in passes completed, completion percentage and interceptions. But the Longhorns had one of the program's worst seasons, going 1–9 for its worst record since 1938. For the rest of the 20th century, they would never fail to win at least four games in a year. With the exception of the first game against USC, when Vince Matthews replaced him after he suffered a concussion, Clements would be the primary quarterback all season. The team's only win was a 7–6 squeaker against Tulane – won by a blocked extra point. Furthermore, the team was shut out twice for the first time since 1938. They were beaten by number 1 Oklahoma in a 45–0 rout and later in the season by TCU, 46–0.\nAfter the 1956 season, Coach Ed Price was fired. Darrell Royal was hired to replace him and Royal replaced the pocket pass-oriented offense that Clements did well in with the split-T option that played more to the strengths of Fondren. Clements fell down the depth chart and as a result only saw limited action in four games during his senior season.\nHe finished with a 5–13 record as a starting quarterback at Texas.\nCoaching.\nClements became a high school football coach and in 1975 became the head coach at his alma mater, Huntsville. During his 19 years in Huntsville, he guided the Hornets to 14 playoff seasons and won the 1980 state title. He finished his 27-year head coaching career with a record of 221–77–6. Among others, Clements was the coach of filmmaker Richard Linklater and was the basis for the football coach in the 1993 movie \"Dazed and Confused\".\nHe was inducted into the Texas High School Sports Hall of Fame in 2010 for his contributions as a player.\nLater life.\nClements married a former University of Texas cheerleader and raised three sons, two of whom later played professional football.\nSteve was the starting quarterback at Huntsville, where he became Texas's high school player of the year, and the state's all-time leading high school passer, surpassing the record set by Ty Detmer. After originally attending Texas, he transferred to BYU when he was unhappy with his place on the depth chart. He played in the CFL and AFL before becoming a high school football coach.\nChuck went to the University of Houston and later played several years in the NFL."

In a T20I, the two teams play a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of 20 overs. The format was originally introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board for the county cricket competition with the first matches contested on 13 June 2003 between the English counties in the Twenty20 Cup. The first T20I took place on 17 February 2005 when Australia defeated New Zealand by 44 runs at Eden Park in Auckland.\nA century is a score of one hundred or more runs by a batsman in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. The first century in a T20I match was scored by Chris Gayle of the West Indies who made 117 against South Africa at the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007.\nIndia's Rohit Sharma and Australia's Glenn Maxwell jointly lead the list with five T20I centuries each. In July 2018, Australia's Aaron Finch scored 172 from 76 balls against Zimbabwe to break his own record for the highest score in a T20I match, eclipsing the 156 he set in August 2013. Namibia's Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton  holds the record for the fastest T20I century, reaching the milestone in 33 deliveries against Nepal during 2024 Nepal Tri-Nation T20I Series.\nFour players have scored a century on their T20I debuts. The oldest player to score a T20I century is Gibraltar's Avinash Pai who was aged 39 years and 272 days when he reached 107 not out runs against Bulgaria in October 2021. At the age of 18 years and 280 days, Gustav Mckeon of France became the youngest, scoring 109 runs in July 2022 against Switzerland.\n, 147 centuries have been scored by 110 different players. India lead the list with 17 centuries."

The season ended with Partizan winning the league championship; despite finishing the season with an identical 19-3 record as Cibona, Partizan was better in their seasonal head-to-head, winning both of their contests during the season.\nNotable events.\nPartizan vs. Cibona season series.\nThe season was decided in two Partizan-Cibona games. First one was played in Zagreb during the first part of the season. The visiting team jumped out to an early 20+ point lead carried by Dragan Kićanović, Miško Marić, and Boban Petrović. However, in the second half, led by its center line — consisting of 32-year-old veteran Krešimir Ćosić who returned to Yugoslav League after two years in Italy and promising young prospect Andro Knego — Cibona annulled Partizan's first half lead. Still, Partizan held their nerve at the end, winning the game 94-95. Kićanović led all scorers with 32 points while his teammates Marić and Petrović contributed with 25 and 22 points, respectively. On the other side, Cibona's veteran center Ćosić scored 28 points while Knego added 26.\nThe second Partizan-Cibona game of the season was played during spring 1981 in Belgrade. It turned out to be almost a carbon copy of the first one. Cheered on by a large and boisterous home crowd, Partizan jumped out to an early lead of over 20 points again before Cibona again came back in the second half. Partizan again proved calmer in a tense finish with Boban Petrović making a clutch bank jump shot that won the game for the Belgrade club 91-87. Petrović and Kićanović led Partizan in this key contest with 26 points each while Arsenije Pešić added 14. In Cibona, Knego and Željko Pavličević led the scoring with 27 and 24 points, respectively while its two best players Aco Petrović and Ćosić had a poor shooting night with only 7 and 4 points, respectively.\nClassification.\nThe winning roster of Partizan:\nCoach: Borislav Ćorković\nResults.\nOther sources:\nQualification in 1981-82 season European competitions.\nFIBA European Champions Cup\nFIBA Cup Winners' Cup\nFIBA Korać Cup"

        "title": "Duluth All-City Golf Tournament",
        "text": "The Duluth All-City Golf Tournament was conceived in 1941 as a demanding contest to determine annually the city golf champion of Duluth, Minnesota. To that end, tournament sponsors Duluth News-Tribune and Duluth Herald established a season-ending golf tournament of the best 32 golfers representing the city's two public (Enger Park Golf Course and Lester Park Golf Course) and three private (Northland Country Club, Ridgeview Country Club and Riverside Golf Club) golf courses.\nThe field of 32 players was determined by 36-hole medal play intramural tournaments conducted at each golf course - some doubling as club championships. Ridgeview and Northland both qualified six players for the tournament, Enger Park and Lester Park seven each and Riverside four. Golfers unattached to any of the Duluth golf courses could compete for two at-large spots (Riverside closed in 1943 and its four entries were divided among Enger Park and Lester Park). Having qualified for the tournament, the participants played 18-hole match play elimination rounds with the two finalists playing a 36-hole match. Each year, the tournament rotated among the Duluth courses.\nThe first All-City champion was 28 year-old Jim Koehler of Enger Park who defeated fellow club member Wally Johnson 2 and 1 in a rain and wind-swept 36-hole match. Medal scores were excellent considering the conditions with Koehler shooting 73-78 (151) and Johnson 76-75 (151) over the par 72 Northland County Club layout. The championship golf trophy - a large silver loving cup to be displayed at the home club of the champion - was presented to Koehler. Koehler would repeat as winner in 1944 and 1953.\nThe Duluth All-City Golf Tournament quickly became one of the most prestigious golf events and a major among local and regional tournaments. Sponsorship by the two Duluth newspapers assured lavish print promotion and detailed coverage of the event. The mayor of Duluth added to the trappings of pomp and ceremony by officiated the drawing of pairings during the early years of the tournament.\nOver the years, the structure of the tournament evolved. By 1943, the Northland and Ridgeview clubs determined their entries by selecting their lowest handicap players - a change adopted by Enger Park and Lester Park a few years later. A junior event was added in 1944. A substantial change occurred in 1955 when the tournament moved to 72-hole medal play. Under this format, a 36-hole cut eliminated all but eight players with a 54-hole cut further reducing the field to four players for the final 18 holes. A year later, the tournament was reduced to 36-holes all played on a single day to lessen the burden on the host course which had to close access to members or to the public to conduct the tournament.\nBecause of the competitive nature of the tournament, the All-City produced champions that also succeeded in competitions at both state and national levels. Among the junior champions, Bob Magie III and Gary Burton would subsequently win the Minnesota Golf Association's State Amateur Championship. At the senior level, John Jenswold was a two-time NCAA National Golf Tournament runner-up and 1944 Big Ten Conference champion. Tom Maas was the 1962 NAIA National Golf Tournament runner-up. Bob Fretland became a PGA touring professional and Jim Nordine lost 1-up to Jack Nicklaus in the quarterfinals of the 1959 Trans-Mississippi Amateur – one month before claiming his second Duluth All-City title. Duluthian Leo Spooner - one of the most successful amateur golfers from northern Minnesota and a member of the Minnesota Golf Hall of Fame - did not win the All-City; one of the very few area tournaments for which he did not have at least one victory.\nThe last Duluth All-City Golf Tournament was played in 1963. Prior to its demise, declining interest had caused some of the golf clubs to struggle filling their allocation of participants. Quotas were juggled among the clubs and at-large entrants became a larger percentage of the field. North Lakes Golf Association (NLGA) officials - who assumed promotion of the tournament from the Duluth News Tribune and Duluth Herald in 1954 - blamed the declining interest in the tournament on its timing. At its beginning in 1941, there were only a small number of golf tournaments available for area golfers. Over subsequent years, many other events such as the Reidar Lund Skyline Memorial Golf Tournament and Silver Bay Men's Invitational had been added to the summer tournament schedule so that by late September - when the All-City was conducted - players were no longer interested in tournament golf.\nIn early 1963, local golf officials decided to merge the Duluth City Public Links and the All-City golf tournaments into one large event to be known as the All-City Championship. At the time, the Public Links tournament was one of the oldest tournaments in Duluth having been conducted for 36 years. As with the All-City tournament, it had been one of the more popular events attracting most of the area's better golfers. However, it too had seen diminishing appeal in recent years. NLGA officials hoped that one big tournament would renew participant interest. The Public Links tournament was canceled as planned but the proposed All-City Championship didn't get off the ground because of other preoccupations by the NLGA. Consequently, the NLGA made a last-minute decision to play the All-City tournament for 1963 which was won by Rick Liljedahl. Jim Koehler, winner of the very first All-City tournament 22 years earlier, tied for second.\nHaving received a one-year reprieve, city golf pros and North Lakes Golf Association officials decided to end the All-City tournament in 1964 when it was concluded that they would have to increase the number of at-large entrants to more than six which no longer made it an \"All-City\" crown. Along with the discontinuance of the Duluth City Public Links Tournament the year before, two of the four local \"Grand Slam\" tournaments were no longer contested and a significant chapter in the history of competitive golf in Duluth was ended."

He was part of the team at the 1994 Asian Games, 1996 Summer Olympics, 1998 Asian Games and 2002 Asian Games.\nEarly years.\nLee enjoyed playing various sports from a young age and began focusing on basketball in high school. He attended Hongik University High School in Seoul.\nPlaying career.\nLee went on to Yonsei University and graduated with a degree in business. His time at Yonsei coincided with what is often retrospectively dubbed the \"golden era\" of domestic college basketball. He and his teammates, as well as their counterparts from traditional athletic rivals Korea University, enjoyed a level of popularity similar to that of idol singers and A-list actors/actresses due to their skills and good looks. Together with his Yonsei teammates Moon Kyung-eun and Woo Ji-won and Korea University's Hyun Joo-yup and Chun Hee-chul, among others, they were collectively dubbed \"Oppa Troupe\" (오빠부대) by the media.\nAfter graduating in February 1995, Lee signed with the Daejeon-based semi-professional team of Hyundai, which was later taken over by its affiliate KCC Corporation and is now Jeonju KCC Egis. Two months later, he chose to enlist for mandatory military service in order to \"get it over with\" and was assigned to the . While playing for the Sangmu team, he became the first domestic player to score a triple-double. He achieved it during a game against SBS in the National Basketball Festival, then the main basketball competition of the semi-professional era.\nBy the time Lee was discharged in 1997, the professional league had just been established. He played a pivotal role in Hyundai's dominance, winning the regular season title and KBL Championship in 1998 and 1999. During the early years of the KBL, he formed an offensive triumvirate with forward Choo Seung-gyun and swingman Cho Sung-won, known collectively as the \"Lee-Cho-Choo trio\"; Choo and Cho were known for their shooting skills and prowess around the perimeter while Lee provided the assists and passes. Later in his career, he developed the defensive facet of his game and gained a reputation as a \"dual threat\" point guard who contributed both offensively and defensively. By his last season as a player, he had recorded 173 blocks in over 500 games, the highest-ranked guard among domestic players in the category and despite being at least 10 cm shorter than the average forward and center.\nLee retired at the end of the 2009-10 season, along with Woo and Moon. Their jersey numbers were retired by their respective clubs. Lee's number 10 jersey was retired by Jeonju KCC Egis.\nNational team.\nLee was a member of the gold medal winning team at the 2002 Asian Games. During the semi-final against the Philippines, he attempted a three-pointer in the last minute of the game with the score at 66–68 and scored to win the game 69–68. South Korea won its first gold medal in basketball in twenty years.\nCoaching career.\nLee returned to Seoul Samsung Thunders in 2012 as a member of the coaching staff. He became head coach ahead of the 2014-15 season.\nIn January 2022, he announced his resignation and his assistant Lee Kyu-sup was named acting head coach for the remainder of the season. His resignation was announced in light of the team's poor results and two players being charged with drunk driving in the space of nine months."

The final tournament was held in Japan from 29 September to 20 October 2018.

This was the first all-European final in the Women's World Championship history and the first final since 1990 that not featured a team from the Americas. Reigning olympic champions China won the third place match, defeating Netherlands in straight sets. For the first time since the 1974 Championship in Mexico, no team from the Americas reached the final four. Tijana Bošković from Serbia was elected the MVP.\nHost selection.\nOn 25 August 2014, FIVB announced that the tournament would be held in Japan for the third time in twelve years and the fifth time overall. The tournament will take place in six cities: Hamamatsu, Kobe, Nagoya, Osaka, Sapporo, and Yokohama.\nJapan hosted the Women's World Championship on four previous occasions: 1967, 1998, 2006, and 2010. Moreover, Japan also hosted the Men's World Championship in 1998 and 2006. The country has also played hosts to other important volleyball competitions, including the Asian Women's Volleyball Championship and the World Grand Prix final round.\nQualification.\nThe qualification process was a series of tournaments organised by the five FIVB confederations to decide 22 of the 24 teams which would play in the final tournament, with Japan qualifying automatically as hosts and United States also qualifying automatically as the defending champions. All remaining FIVB member associations were eligible to enter the qualifying process.\nAt first, 160 associations registered teams to compete in the qualification process, but 46 associations withdrew from the qualifying process after they registered and India were suspended and then expelled from taking part in the process as a punishment for internal problems in the India Volleyball Federation.\nThe five regional governing bodies were allocated the remaining 22 spots; CAVB (Africa) was granted two, AVC (Asia and Oceania) four, NORCECA (North America) six, CSV (South America) two, and CEV (Europe) eight spots.\nOf the 24 nations qualified to play at the 2018 World Championship, 21 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014. Trinidad and Tobago qualified for the first time. Other teams returning after absences of the last tournament(s) include Kenya and South Korea, who both missed the 2014 edition.\nFormat.\nIn the first round, the 24 teams are spread across four pools of six teams playing in a round-robin system. The top four teams from each pool advance to the second round.\nIn the second round, the 16 teams are allocated in two pools of eight teams (top teams from first round pools A and D in one and top teams from pools B and C in the other). Once again a round-robin system is used in each pool, teams coming from the same first round pool (therefore already played each other) only play against opponents from a different first round pool.

        "text": "Graeme Swann, a right-arm off-spinner, represented the England cricket team in 60 Tests, 79 One Day Internationals (ODI), and 39 Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) between 2000 and 2013. He took eighteen five-wicket hauls in international cricket – seventeen in Tests and one in ODIs. In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and only 42 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers as of July 2015. The English cricket journalist Scyld Berry described Swann as \"the best off-break bowler that England have had for more than half a century\", and \"the most effective spinner that England’s limited-overs teams have ever had\". Swann claimed 255 wickets in Test cricket, second only to Derek Underwood (297) among English spin bowlers.\nSwann made his Test debut in December 2008, taking four wickets in a match which England lost against India. His first Test five-wicket haul came early the following year against the West Indies at the Antigua Recreation Ground, when he took five wickets for 57 runs. Once during his career, Swann took five wickets in each innings of a match, against Bangladesh in 2010. This was also the first of three occasions in which he took ten wickets in a match. His career-best figures for an innings were six wickets for 65 runs against Pakistan at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground in August 2010.\nIn ODI cricket, Swann made his debut in January 2000 against South Africa, but off-field misdemeanours resulted in him being dropped from the team after just one match, and he did not play international cricket again until 2007. His solitary five-wicket haul in ODIs was against Australia in September 2009, a match England won by four wickets. Swann took five wickets for 28 runs in the match, and was given the man of the match award. He took 104 wickets in ODIs at an average of 27.76. Swann took 51 wickets in T20I cricket, but did not claim any five-wicket hauls; his best bowling figures in the format were three wickets for 13 runs. As of July 2015, his combined tally of 17 five-wicket hauls is twenty-seventh in the all-time list, a position he shares with Lance Gibbs."

        "title": "Tuck rule (ice hockey)",
        "text": "The tuck rule is a rule by the National Hockey League (NHL) that stipulates how jerseys must be worn over protective equipment. Notable players who have previously tucked in their jerseys include Alexander Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin, Patrice Bergeron, Kris Letang, Pavel Datsyuk, Wayne Gretzky and Jaromir Jagr. However, the rule has not been strictly enforced since its introduction to the NHL, as some players, such as Connor McDavid, Evgeni Malkin and Wayne Simmonds have been seen with a slight tuck in their jersey. Detroit Red Wings winger Daniel Sprong continues to tuck his jersey during play.\nRule description.\nThe official rule by the National Hockey League is as follows:\nNHL Rule 9.5. All protective equipment, except gloves, headgear, and goaltenders' leg guards must be worn under the uniform. Should it be brought to the attention of the referee that a player is wearing, for example, an elbow pad that is not covered by his jersey, he shall instruct the player to cover up the pad and a second violation by the same player would result in a minor penalty being assessed. &lt;br&gt;\nRule 9.5 governs all protective equipment, including pants. Players are not permitted to tuck their jersey into their pants in such a manner where the top padding of the pant and/or additional body protection (affixed to the pant or affixed to the player's body) is exposed outside the jersey. The back uniform number must not be covered or obstructed in any fashion by protruding pads or other protective padding.\" \nThe NHL decided to newly enforce uniform policies starting with the 2013–14 season. As a result, players are not allowed to tuck their jerseys into their pants, expose their elbow pads, or make any other modifications to their jerseys.\nViolations of this rule (which is called the \"jersey tuck rule\") are as follows:\nIt is unclear if the minor penalty will be called for delay of game or an equipment violation. As of 2013, the NHL Department of Hockey Operations and referees are still determining how the penalty will be called.\nEnforcement.\nAlthough these policies have existed since 1964, they were not enforced until general managers voted to enforce it in the 2013–14 season. Some reporters suggested that enforcing uniform rules was the National Hockey League's attempt to reduce freak accidents where a player's body was cut by skate blade while others said the league was laying down rules for eventually selling advertising space that would display prominently on the entire jersey. In a September 2013 pre-season game between the Carolina Hurricanes and the Columbus Blue Jackets, Alexander Semin became the first player penalized for this infraction. After receiving an official's initial warning in that game, his jersey became tucked in again after scoring the second goal in that game. He received the minor penalty 15 minutes later for violating the tuck rule a second time in the game. In response, Semin later stitched his jersey to his pants. However, by early October in the same year, it was reported that the league's hockey operations department would relax on enforcing the tuck rule. The penalty would not be enforced if the jersey was tucked in while skating as long as the jersey was untucked at the beginning of a shift.\nThe rule brings the league in line with other hockey leagues and tournaments, such as the Olympics.\nReception.\nReactions to the tuck rule by NHL players and coaches were overwhelmingly negative. Alexander Ovechkin called the rule \"stupid\". Former Washington Capitals head coach Adam Oates also disagreed with the rule, citing that superstar players like Wayne Gretzky and Ovechkin tucking in their jerseys were part of their identity. Toronto Maple Leafs player Joffrey Lupul questioned the rule while Morgan Rielly said he was not aware of this rule until the Semin penalty. Boston Bruins centre Patrice Bergeron, often seen with his jersey tucked underneath his protective pants, said he did not do it intentionally but felt that it could become an issue during regular season games."

        "text": "The Masters of the Universe Role Playing Game is a licensed role-playing game published by FASA in 1985 that is based on the popular Mattel television media franchise.\nDescription.\n\"The Masters of the Universe Role Playing Game\" is a fantasy system based on the \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" cartoon series. It consists of a boardgame that includes simple role-playing rules. Players can take on the roles of popular characters like He-Man, Teela, and Orko, who are pitted against Skeletor and the forces of evil. The rules are presented in comic-book style by staff artists from First Comics. The set includes cardstock character cards, miniatures, and components.\nAlthough the game is billed as a role-playing game, there is no gamemaster; instead, players randomly determine monsters and other encounters every time they enter a new room.\nPublication history.\nIn 1981, Mattel released the first line of the \"Master of the Universe\" action figures and it rapidly gained in popularity, leading to a short-lived television series. In 1985, FASA acquired the game license for the \"Master of the Universe\" franchise and produced \"The Masters of the Universe Role Playing Game\", designed by Ross Babcock with Jack C. Harris. The game was published as a boxed set that included a 24-page book, a color board, two cardstock sheets, and dice with illustrations by Hilary Barta, Doug Rice, Willie Schubert, and Rick Taylor.\nHowever, by the time the game was released, the television series was coming to an end. The game was rushed out to the printers half-finished to release it to market before the show was cancelled. \nThe game failed to find an audience, and was quickly discontinued.\nReception.\nIn Issue 21 of \"Breakout!\", Nick Calder pointed out that although the game is designed to be played without a referee, it can be long and drawn out as the players must randomly determine an encounter every time they enter a new room. Calder suggested, \"With only a few minor rule changes, a referee can be added and speeds things up considerably if just a few moments are spent before the game (perhaps half an hour) to draw up a list of encounters.\" Calder concluded, \"Essentially this is a kid's game and hardened gamers who like to spend hours on character development should probably stay away.\"\nIn his 1990 book \"The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games\", game critic Rick Swan felt that this was more a board game than a role-playing game. Swan also found the idea of presenting the rules in comic form was \"more clever than practical — just try sorting through the word balloons to find the rule you need.\" Most importantly, Swan thought although the game was the game rules were too difficult for players under the age of 8, who were the target audience, and players older than 8 \"will probably find it beneath their dignity.\" Swan gave the game a very poor rating of only 1.5 out f 4. \nDaniel Mackay, in his 2001 book \"The Fantasy Role-Playing Game: A New Performing Art\", noted this game was an example of an unsuccessful licensed role-playing game."

Pépin had hired two riders, Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending the night in the best hotels they could find. Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists in the history of the Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for their team leader's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, Jean-Marie Teychenne, lying in a ditch. They helped him get up, fed him, and from that moment Teycheime was also helping Pépin.\nAs in the previous years, there were two classes of cyclists, the \"coureurs de vitesse\" and the \"coureurs sur machines poinçonnées\". Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant that they had to finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The \"coureurs de vitesse\" could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.\nAlthough the riders officially rode the Tour as individuals, some had the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams. At the start of the race, it was clear that the riders sponsored by Alcyon and the riders sponsored by Peugeot would compete for the overall victory. Alcyon started with three main contenders: Louis Trousselier, Marcel Cadolle and Léon Georget; Peugeot counted on Emile Georget."

The favourite for the victory was Lucien Mazan \"Petit-Breton\", the winner of the previous edition. He was supported by his Peugeot-team, which included the best cyclists; in the five previous editions of the Tour de France, they had won 20 stages. In addition, Petit-Breton was a skilled bicycle mechanic, which was important because the rules said that cyclists had to repair their bicycle without help. The strongest opposition was expected from the Alcyon team, led by Georges Passerieu and Gustave Garrigou.\nFrench athlete Marie Marvingt had tried to participate in the 1908 Tour de France, but was refused permission because the race was only open to men. She rode the route after the race, and managed to finish it."

Faber had transferred from the Peugeot team, that had dominated the 1908 edition, to the Alcyon team.\nA new record of 150 cyclists started the race. The previous Tours had been successful, and similar races were initiated in other countries (most notably the Tour of Belgium, which started in 1908 and the Giro d'Italia, which started in 1909). The Tour de France was still the major race where the best cyclists came, and it was the first large-scale invasion of foreign stars. In total, 19 Italians, 5 Belgians, 4 Swiss, 1 German and 1 Luxembourgian started the race.\nBecause cyclists could enter the race as sponsored cyclists, there were two classes of cyclists: cyclists with sponsors and cyclists without sponsors. There were seven different sponsors in the race (Nil-Supra, Alcyon, Biguet-Dunlop, Le Globe, Atala, Legnano and Felsina), with three to six cyclists. The majority of the cyclists, 112 in total, were not sponsored but were in the \"Isolé\" class, the class for cyclists without a sponsor."

The stages had checkpoints where riders had to sign, and on these checkpoints the sponsored riders were allowed to be given food and drinks. The other category consisted of 67 isolated riders; they were not allowed to be given food or drinks during these checkpoints.\nThe previous edition had been a close battle between teammates Octave Lapize and François Faber from the Alcyon team, won by Lapize. Lapize had changed teams to the La Française team, where he was joined by former winner Lucien Petit-Breton (winner in 1907 and 1908). Petit-Breton was a late replacement for Cyrille van Hauwaert, who was not feeling healthy enough to ride the Tour."

In 1913, this changed, and cyclists from the same team were allowed to work together. The organizers preferred riders to ride solo, so they added a rule that if a cyclist would win a stage with a margin of 20 minutes or more, he would not only get his own prize money, but also the half of all the other cyclists' prize money of that stage.\nThe first African cyclist took part in the Tour de France in 1913: Ali Neffati from Tunisia. Neffati had been discovered by Tour organizer Henri Desgrange, and would later become a driver at \"l'Auto\", the newspaper that organised the Tour de France."

The Albanian swimming federation is a member of the European Swimming League (LEN) and the International Swimming Federation (FINA). The Albanian Swimming Federation organizes aquatic sports competitions at national, European and international level in all categories for men and women; junior and adult age groups. The Albanian Swimming Federation works closely with its collaborative associate, the Kosovo swimming federation.\nHistory.\nSwimming in Albania has its roots in Durrës, where races began centuries ago. The swimming federation was formed in the late 1950s. Albanians more prominent in the sport included Jani Hondro and Spiro Koço.\nThe first person to represent Albania in the Olympics was an American born Albanian, Frank Leskaj. Leskaj represented Albania in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. It was not until the late 2000s where swimming began to flourish in Albania. It wasn't until 2004 that Albania would be represented again in the summer Olympics by Kreshnik Gjata. Four years later, a young swimmer at the age of 16 years represented Albania again in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The swimmers name was Sidni Hoxha and he became a record holder for Albania that year. Till date, Hoxha, is Albania's most successful swimmer. Hoxha has participated in two Olympics, holding more than 50% of the national records, countless European and world championships, two time NCAA swimming competitor, and former Balkan Champion. Hoxha is acclaimed and determined to represent Albania two more times in the Olympics, for a total of four times. Also, in 2008, Albania's first female swimmer was Rovena Marku. Marku, also broke the national record for 50m freestyle that year in Beijing.\nIn 2012, Sidni Hoxha and Noel Borshi represented Albania in the summer Olympics in London.\nMember clubs.\n there are more than a dozen member clubs.\nResults.\nAlbania has participated in three Mediterranean Games, three LCM European Championships, four LCM World Championships, and four Summer Olympics."

Due to naming rights the arena was known as the latter for the duration of the games. A total of thirteen boxing events will be held: ten for men and three for women.\nVenue.\nThe competitions will take place at the General Motors Centre (Oshawa Sports Centre) located about in the city of Oshawa, about 60 kilometers from the athletes village. The arena will have a reduced capacity (from its normal of about 5,500) of about 3,000 people per session. The venue will also host weightlifting competitions earlier during the games.\nNew rules.\nTo harmonise with the rules of amateur boxing decided by the Association Internationale de Boxe Amateur (AIBA), Pan Am Boxing will feature new rules. There will be an introduction of the \"10-point must\" scoring system used in the pro game, where the winner of each round must be awarded 10 points and the loser a lesser amount, and the elimination of the padded headgear. AIBA new rules want to take away the focus on the head as the key scoring location.\nThe AIBA, boxing's world body, said removing the headgear would actually make things safer by reducing concussions, and the jury is out on that. Now, the boxer will have to concentrate on the whole body and proper ring tactics. The International Olympic Committee has not as yet decided whether to permit boxing without headgear for Rio in 2016. How thing go in Toronto this year may go a long way to a final decision. AIBA officials are also waiting to see how things go in the men's game before making a decision to take headgear off women fighters.\nCompetition schedule.\nThe following is the competition schedule for the boxing competitions:\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 24 countries have qualified athletes. The number of athletes a nation has entered is in parentheses beside the name of the country. \nQualification.\nA total of 120 boxers (96 male and 24 women) will qualify to compete at the games. The top three boxers in each men's category at the 2015 World Series of Boxing will qualify. The rest of the quotas (including all the women's quotas) will be awarded at a qualification tournament in June 2015. Canada as host nation has an automatic berth in one women's and five men's categories, and will need to qualify in all other categories."

Anquetil announced before the race that he would take the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification on the first day, and wear it until the end of the race in Paris.\nGastone Nencini, who won the previous edition, did not enter in 1961, but Graziano Battistini, his teammate and runner-up of 1960, started the race as leader of the Italian team. If the French team would again have internal struggles, the Italian team could emerge as the winner.\nThe Spanish team had two outsiders, José Pérez Francés and Fernando Manzaneque. The last outsider was Charly Gaul, winner of the 1958 Tour de France, who rode in the mixed Luxembourg-Swiss team. He considered his teammates so weak that he did not seek their help, and rode the race on his own.\nRaymond Poulidor was convinced by his team manager Antonin Magne that it would be better to skip the Tour, because the national team format would undermine his commercial value."

The three-week race of 22 stages, including two split stages, started in Nancy on 24 June and finished at the Parc des Princes in Paris on 15 July.\nFrom 1930 to 1961, the Tour de France was contested by national teams, but in 1962 commercially sponsored international trade teams returned. From the late-1950s to 1962, the Tour had seen the absence of top riders who had bowed to pressure from their teams' \"extra-sportif\" (non-cycling industry) sponsors to ride other races that better suited their brands. This, and a demand for wider advertising from a declining bicycle industry, led to the reintroduction of the trade team format. In early February 1962, 22 teams submitted applications for the race, with the final list of 15 announced at the end of the month. The Spanish-based was the first choice reserve team.\nEach of the 15 teams consisted of 10 cyclists (150 total), an increase from the 1961 Tour, which had 11 teams of 12 cyclists (132 total). Each team was required to have a dominant nationality; at least six cyclists should have the same nationality, or only two nationalities should be present. For the first time, French cyclists were outnumbered; the largest number of riders from a nation came from Italy (52), with the next largest coming from France (50) and Belgium (28). Riders represented a further six nations, all European. Of the start list of 150, 66 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The total number of riders that finished the race was 94, a record high to that point. The average age of riders in the race was 27.5 years, ranging from the 21-year-old Tiziano Galvanin () to the 40-year-old Pino Cerami (). The cyclists had the youngest average age while cyclists had the oldest. The presentation of the teams – where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place outside the in Nancy before the start of the opening stage held in the city.\nRudi Altig of was the first rider to wear the general classification's yellow jersey after winning the first stage. Altig lost it the following day to André Darrigade of , who won stage 2a, before regaining it after winning stage three. The race lead was taken by Altig's teammate Albertus Geldermans after stage six. He held it for two stages, before Darrigade took it back for the next two. rider Willy Schroeders then led the race from the end of stage nine to the end of eleven, at which point Schroeder's teammate Rik Van Looy, a major pre-race favourite, abandoned the race with an injury. The following day, British rider Tom Simpson of Gitane–Leroux became the first from outside mainland Europe to wear the yellow jersey. He lost it after stage thirteen's individual time trial in the Pyrenees to Flandria's Jef Planckaert, who then held it for seven stages, which included the Alps. Jacques Anquetil of Saint-Raphaël won the individual time trial of stage twenty to put himself into the yellow jersey, which he held until the conclusion of the race; he defended his title, winning his third Tour de France. Planckaert finished second in the general classification, 4 min and 59 s in arrears, with rider Raymond Poulidor third, over ten minutes behind Anquetil. Altig won the points classification and Margnat's Federico Bahamontes won the mountains classification. Saint-Raphaël won the team classification. The overall awards for most combative and unluckiest were given to Eddy Pauwels of and Van Looy respectively.

While in his final junior season with the London Knights, Anderson was signed to a three-year entry-level contract with the Blue Jackets. He made his NHL debut on January 16, 2015, against the New York Rangers. During the 2015–16, Anderson underwent surgery to repair a small orbital fracture that had occurred during a preseason game, and was expected to miss up to four weeks to recover. Despite his setback, Anderson scored his first NHL goal on January 9, 2016, against Cam Ward of the Carolina Hurricanes. He was returned to the American Hockey League shortly afterwards where he helped lead the Monsters to the 2016 Calder Cup.\nDuring the 2017–18 season, Anderson injured his knee in a game against the Washington Capitals and was expected to be out for four weeks. The following season was a breakout one for Anderson. He played the entire 82-game season in the NHL and put up a career high 47 points as the Blue Jackets advanced to the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in franchise history.\nIn the 2019–20 season, Anderson was unable to replicate his offensive game, posting just 1 goal and 4 points in 26 games before suffering a posterior labral tear of his left shoulder against the Ottawa Senators on December 14, 2019. With the injury failing to respond to rehabilitation, Anderson had season-ending shoulder surgery on March 2, 2020, with an expected recovery period of 4–6 months.\nMontreal Canadiens.\nOn October 6, 2020, Anderson was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Max Domi and a third-round pick in the 2020 NHL Draft. On October 8, Anderson as a restricted free agent was signed to a seven-year, $38.5 million contract extension with the Canadiens. He made an immediate impression on arrival in Montreal, and was first dubbed a \"powerhorse\" by new teammate Tomáš Tatar, a nickname that was soonly widely adopted. Anderson recorded 17 goals and 7 assists during the pandemic-shortened regular season, and was widely regarded as one of the standouts during a tough season for the team. He was noted for his ability to deliver \"big game performances\". This was reinforced during the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs, where Anderson recorded five goals over the four rounds of the Canadiens' deep run to the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals. Four of those goals came in two games, the first a two-goal performance in Game 3 of the semifinal series against the Vegas Golden Knights that first gave Montreal the series lead, with Anderson first tying the game in the closing minutes thanks to a misplay by Knights goaltender Marc-André Fleury and then scoring the overtime winner. In Game 4 of the Cup Finals against the Tampa Bay Lightning, with the Canadiens facing elimination, Anderson scored the first goal of the game and then won it in overtime, notching the team's one win in the series.\nIn preparation for the 2021–22 season, Anderson began playing on a line with Jonathan Drouin and former London Knights teammate Christian Dvorak, who had just been traded to the Canadiens. Drouin, who had missed much of the previous season due to anxiety and cited Anderson as a close friend and support through his difficulties, would score the Canadiens' first goal of the season off of Anderson's feed. The Canadiens struggled greatly in the beginning of the season, while Anderson managed a team-leading seven goals (as well as six assists) through the first 24 games of the season before sustaining an upper body injury in a December 3 game against the Colorado Avalanche. It was announced that he would miss between two and four weeks as a result. Anderson ultimately returned to the lineup in mid-January. As the team continued to struggle coach Dominique Ducharme was sacked and replaced with Martin St-Louis, who revamped the lineup and created a new first line with Anderson, Nick Suzuki and Cole Caufield that immediately began producing results. On March 1, 2022, Anderson scored his first career hat trick in an 8–4 loss to the Winnipeg Jets. Anderson later spent some games away from the first line, as St-Louis expressed a desire to revise his style of play to emphasize more than being a \"physical guy.\"\nAfter notching three goals and two assists in the first twelve games of the 2022–23 season, Anderson was suspended for two games for boarding Golden Knights defenceman Alex Pietrangelo. He appeared in 69 games that season, scoring 21 goals and registering an additional 11 assists. His season ended prematurely when he sustained a high ankle sprain in a March 21 game against the Lightning, after being driven into the net by defenceman Mikhail Sergachev.\nThe beginning of Anderson's 2023–24 season was marked by a lengthy scoring drought that became a topic of widespread sports media discussion. He remarked that it was \"very tough,\" in that \"every day you think about when you're going to break out of that slump and start putting them in the back of the net.\" He scored an empty net goal in a December 4 game against the Seattle Kraken, the team's 25th game of the season, bringing a 27-game goalless streak to an end. Anderson scored two goals against goaltender Semyon Varlamov in a Canadiens victory over the New York Islanders on December 16, his first scored against a goaltender in 34 games dating back to March 13. Named the first star of the game, he received a standing ovation from the crowd. Anderson received the Molson Cup as the team's best player of the month of December, ultimately having scored six goals and nine points in that span.\nInternational play.\nOn December 2, 2013, Anderson and teammate Bo Horvat were invited to partake in Canada national junior ice hockey team's selection camp prior to the 2013 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He scored one goal in the course of seven games, where the Canadian team finished fourth.\nFollowing the 2021–22 NHL season, with the Canadiens not qualifying for the playoffs, Anderson accepted an invitation to join Canada national team at the 2022 IIHF World Championship in Tampere. Anderson registered an assist in his tournament debut, Canada's 5–3 victory over Germany. In his first nine games, Anderson scored a goal and six assists, including an assist in Canada's 6–1 semi-final victory over Czech Republic to reach the championship final. He registered another assist in a 4–3 loss to Finland in the final, earning a silver medal."

The cyclists were divided in two categories, this time named \"1ère class\" (first class), the professionals, and \"2ème classe\" (second class), the amateurs. This year, some of the second class cyclists would finish higher than some of the first class cyclists.\nThe 1921 Tour de France saw the introduction of foreign press.

The 80th annual edition of the tournament began on March 13, 2018, and concluded with the championship game on April 2, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas.\nDuring the first round, UMBC became the first 16-seed to defeat a 1-seed in the men's tournament by defeating Virginia 74–54. For the first time in tournament history, all four top-seeded teams in a single region (the South) failed to make the Sweet 16. The tournament also featured the first regional final matchup of a 9-seed (Kansas State) and an 11-seed (Loyola–Chicago).\nVillanova (returning after their 2016 national championship), Michigan (making their first appearance since their runner-up finish in 2013), Kansas (returning after their runner-up finish in 2012), and Loyola–Chicago (the \"Cinderella team\" of the tournament, and the fourth 11-seed to reach the Final Four, after VCU in 2011), all reached the Final Four. Villanova defeated Michigan in the championship game, 79–62.\nThe 2018 tournament was the first time since 1978 that none of the six Division I college basketball-playing schools based in the Washington, DC metropolitan area – American, Georgetown, George Mason, George Washington, Howard, and Maryland – made the NCAA tournament.\nAtlantic Sun Conference champion Lipscomb made its NCAA tournament debut.\nTournament procedure.\nA total of 68 teams entered the 2018 tournament. 32 automatic bids were awarded, one to each program that won their conference tournament. The remaining 36 bids were \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.\nEight teams (the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as \"play-in games\" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the main draw of the tournament.\nThe Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following sites were selected to host each round of the 2018 tournament:\nFirst Four\nFirst and second rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nThe state of North Carolina was threatened with a 2018-2022 championship venue boycott by the NCAA, due to the HB2 law passed in 2016. However, the law was repealed (but with provisos) days before the NCAA met to make decisions on venues in April 2017. At that time, the NCAA board of governors \"reluctantly voted to allow consideration of championship bids in North Carolina by our committees that are presently meeting\". Therefore, Charlotte was eligible and served as a first weekend venue for the 2018 tournament.\nQualification and selection.\nFour teams, out of 351 in Division I, were ineligible to participate in the 2018 tournament due to failing to meet APR requirements: Alabama A&amp;M, Grambling State, Savannah State, and Southeast Missouri State. However, the NCAA granted the Savannah State Tigers a waiver which would have allowed the team to participate in the tournament, but the team failed to qualify.\nAutomatic qualifiers.\nThe following 32 teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2018 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's automatic bid.\nTournament seeds.\nThe tournament seeds were determined through the NCAA basketball tournament selection process. The seeds and regions were determined as follows:\nRegional brackets.\nAll times are listed as Eastern Daylight Time ()\nFirst Four – Dayton, Ohio.\nThe First Four games involved eight teams: the four overall lowest-ranked teams, and the four lowest-ranked at-large teams.\nFinal Four.\nDuring the Final Four round, regardless of the seeds of the participating teams, the champion of the top overall top seed's region (Virginia's South Region) plays against the champion of the fourth-ranked top seed's region (Xavier's West Region), and the champion of the second overall top seed's region (Villanova's East Region) plays against the champion of the third-ranked top seed's region (Kansas' Midwest Region).\nGame summaries and tournament notes.\nUpsets.\nPer the NCAA, \"Upsets are defined as when the winner of the game was seeded five or more places lower than the team it defeated.\" The 2018 tournament saw a total of 11 upsets; 5 of them were in the first round, 5 of them were in the second round, and one of them was in the Sweet Sixteen.\nRecord by conference.\nThe Pac-12 lost all of its teams after the first day of the main tournament draw, marking the first time since the Big 12 began play in 1996 that one of the six major conferences—defined as the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC, and both versions of the Big East—failed to have a team advance to the tournament's round of 32.\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nCBS Sports and Turner Sports had U.S. television rights to the Tournament under the \"NCAA March Madness\" brand. As part of a cycle beginning in 2016, TBS held the rights to the Final Four and to the championship game.\nFor the first time, TBS held the rights to the Selection Show, which expanded into a two-hour format, was presented in front of a studio audience, and promoted that the entire field of the tournament would be unveiled within the first ten minutes of the broadcast. However, this entailed the 68-team field (beginning with automatic qualifiers, followed by at-large teams) being revealed in alphabetical order, and not by bracket matchups (which was done later in the show). The new format was criticized for lacking suspense, and the show also faced criticism for technical issues, as well as a segment containing product placement for Pizza Hut.\nRadio.\nWestwood One had exclusive radio rights to the entire tournament.\nInternet.\nVideo.\nLive video of games was available for streaming through the following means:\nAudio.\nLive audio of games was available for streaming through the following means:"

The three major cycling countries in 1950, Italy, Belgium and France, each sent a team of 10 cyclists. Other countries sent teams of 6 cyclists: Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Italy and Belgium also sent two extra teams of young riders of 6 cyclists each. The French regional cyclists were divided into five teams of 10 cyclists: Paris, Ile de France–North East, West, Centre–South West and South East. Originally, the plan was to have one extra international team of six cyclists with Spanish cyclists, but this extra team became a North African team, with Moroccan and Algerian cyclists, both being French colonies at the time. Altogether this made 116 cyclists. There were 60 French cyclists (of which 2 French-Moroccan and 4 French-Algerian), 22 Italian, 16 Belgian, 6 Dutch, 6 Luxembourg and 6 Swiss cyclists.\nThe winner of the previous Tour de France, Fausto Coppi, was injured during the 1950 Giro d'Italia, so he could not defend his title. Still the Italians were favourites, especially Gino Bartali, who had come second in the 1950 Giro d'Italia behind Hugo Koblet, who did not enter the 1950 Tour de France. Other candidates for the victory were Bobet, Kübler, Ockers and Geminiani. Two days before the Tour started, the organisation held a poll amongst 25 journalists, who each gave their eight favourites for the victory. Bartali was on the most lists, 23. Robic was written on 20 lists, Lauredi on 19, Bobet and Goldschmidt on 17. On the first day of the race, before the Tour had started, French cyclist Charles Coste was replaced by Paul Giguet."

Beginning with the 2023 season, these games are branded as MLB World Tour.\nList of games.\nTo date, major-league regular-season games have been contested in five countries outside of the United States and Canada: Australia (Sydney), Japan (Tokyo), Mexico (Mexico City and Monterrey), South Korea (Seoul), and the United Kingdom (London).\nThe first MLB World Tour games (as they are now known) were contested in Mexico in 1996 and 1999. From 2000 through 2012, eight such games were contested, all in Japan. Two games were played in Australia in 2014, followed by three games in Mexico in 2018. The 2019 season saw a total of eight games played in Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Following a three year pause, Mexico and the United Kingdom each hosted a two-game series in 2023. Six games, to be played in three different countries, have been scheduled for 2024.\nExhibition contests, such as preseason games or postseason all-star games, are not included in the list below. Several such contests can be found in the \"See also\" section.\nCanceled games.\nIn May 2019, MLB announced that the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals would play a two-game series in London in June 2020, to be known as the 2020 MLB London Series. Additionally, in December 2019, the league announced that the Arizona Diamondbacks and San Diego Padres would play a two-game series in Mexico City in April 2020. These would have been the first regular-season MLB games in Mexico City. Both of these series were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGames played in Puerto Rico.\nEstadio Hiram Bithorn in San Juan, Puerto Rico, has hosted 49 MLB games since 2001. As Puerto Rico is a United States commonwealth, these games are not included in the above table. \nThe Montreal Expos played 43 \"home\" games at Estadio Hiram Bithorn during 2003 and 2004.\nExcluding Expos games, below is a list of neutral-site games played in Puerto Rico:\nIn August 2019, MLB announced a three-game series between the New York Mets and Miami Marlins at Estadio Hiram Bithorn to be played in April 2020. This series was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMLB World Tour.\nAs part of the collective bargaining agreement to end the 2021–22 Major League Baseball lockout, MLB announced a plan to have additional games played internationally, including regular-season games in Tokyo, Seoul, Mexico City, London, and Paris between 2023 and 2026. Beginning with the 2023 season, games outside the U.S. and Canada are branded as \"MLB World Tour\".\nThe MLB Mexico City Series was first contested in 2023 at Estadio Alfredo Harp Helú. The San Diego Padres won both games against the San Francisco Giants.\nIn 2024, the Boston Red Sox and the Tampa Bay Rays played two games during spring training on March 9–10 at Estadio Quisqueya in Santo Domingo; the Red Sox won both games. The Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres opened the regular season at Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul, with each team winning one game. The MLB Seoul Series included the first regular season games to be played in Korea.\nAlso during 2024, the Houston Astros and the Colorado Rockies will play at Estadio Alfredo Harp Helú in Mexico City on April 27–28, and the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies will play at London Stadium in London, as part of the MLB London Series, on June 8–9.\nOn April 3, 2024, the commissioner of Japanese baseball, Sadayuki Sakakibara, told reporters that the 2025 MLB season would open in Japan on March 19–20, which would be the first MLB games played in the country since 2019 (and the first played under World Tour branding); teams and location have yet to be confirmed, and MLB has yet to confirm Sakakibara's statement.\nMLB plans to host games at the Stade de France, just outside Paris, starting in 2025. The games will be the first MLB regular-season games to be contested in mainland Europe. The new Stade de France series is intended to alternate with the London series, which began in 2019 and resumed in 2023 following a three-season pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic. MLB plans to hold games in London in 2024, followed by Paris in 2025, and then in London again in 2026. The Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees have informed MLB that they would like to participate in the 2025 Paris series."

        "title": "Paul Campbell (American football)",
        "text": "Paul Edward Campbell (March 11, 1926 – February 10, 2005) was a college athlete who was the starting quarterback for the Texas Longhorns football team in 1948 and 1949. He was the 22nd pick overall in the 1948 NFL Draft, selected by the Philadelphia Eagles.\nEarly life.\nCampbell was born in Olney, Texas, but shortly thereafter moved to Breckenridge, Texas, where he was an all-district fullback and kicker on the high school football team as well as playing tennis and basketball. He was originally playing in the school band, but after showing talent in a physical education class, his coach Eck Curtis asked him to switch to football. He alternated between halfback and fullback, though occasionally threw the ball, including a game-tying touchdown pass in his last game against Waco in the 1943 Texas 2A state playoffs (they lost the game on the penetrations tiebreaker). The previous year, Campbell and Breckenridge made it all the way to the state semi-finals before losing to eventual state champion Austin.\nCollege football.\nCampbell first enrolled at Texas A&amp;M in February 1944, where he played tennis and basketball, but left after one semester to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. That summer, stationed at South Plains Army Air Field he was selected to play for the Service All-Stars football team. Campbell was again coached by Curtis, who now utilized the newly popular T formation. The All-Stars played an exhibition game against the NFL's Brooklyn Tigers, at their training camp in Abilene. Though the All-Stars lost, Campbell played quarterback for the first time, and his two touchdown passes drew the attention of NFL scouts. He continued to play quarterback and tailback for the base's football team, the Winged Commandos, which played games against other service teams and college teams such as Texas Tech, North Texas Agricultural College and TCU.\nWhen Campbell was discharged from the service in 1946, he decided not to return to A&amp;M and instead attended Rice, but while in Houston he took a weekend trip to Austin, where he ran into his old coach Eck Curtis, who had just been hired as an assistant coach at Texas. Campbell immediately enrolled at Texas, where his experience running the t-formation made him a valuable player. Because he had played tennis and basketball at Texas A&amp;M, and because A&amp;M refused to waive their claims to him, Campbell was ineligible to play those sports at Texas.\nIn his first season at Texas in 1946, Campbell played in only a few games. He intercepted a pass against Missouri and went 4–5 against Colorado for 145 yards.\nIn 1947, Campbell competed with future Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry to be the back up quarterback to another future NFL Hall of Famer, Bobby Layne. Landry broke his thumb three weeks into the season, making it impossible for him to take snaps and as a result was moved to fullback. The team went 10–1, missing out on a perfect record due to a one-point loss to #8 SMU, and won the 1948 Sugar Bowl. In December 1947, Campbell was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third Round of the 1948 NFL draft (22nd overall) based largely on his service play. Layne was drafted by the Chicago Bears that same year.\nCampbell chose not to play professional football and instead competed for the starting role in 1948, and that year, with Layne graduated and Landry at fullback, Campbell became the team's starter. Texas, under second year coach Blair Cherry, was projected to win the Southwest Conference in 1949 and started the season ranked #16. It took Campbell several games to develop as a consistent passer and the team suffered early losses to #2 North Carolina, Oklahoma and then to eventual conference champion SMU. Campbell played better as he gained more experience, including a game-winning pass against Baylor, but the team finished a disappointing 6–3–1, including a tie to Texas A&amp;M whom they were expected to beat. The Longhorns earned a surprise invitation to the Orange Bowl against one-loss and #8 ranked Georgia, where they pulled off an upset 41–28 win behind Landry's 107 yards rushing and Campbell's 66 yards passing and a touchdown.\nIn 1949, Campbell was again the starting quarterback for Texas. Though Texas posted a disappointing 6-4 record, finishing unranked and without a bowl game invitation, Campbell had a stellar season. He set the school record for most yards passing in a single game in a 27–14 defeat of Arkansas that took Texas to the #10 ranking; and set the record for most passing yards in a single season. He led Texas to a 20–0 upset of #6 Baylor. But the Longhorns lost all the close ones, dropping games to #9 Rice by two points, #11 SMU and unranked TCU by one point and #3 Oklahoma by six. Campbell earned Honorable Mention All-Southwest Conference recognition and was invited to the 1950 Senior Bowl.\nCampnell finished his career at Texas with a 13–7–1 record and with the second most career passing yards in school history, behind only Layne, a position he would hold until the early 1980s.\nTo cap off his college career, Campbell was the quarterback for the North team in the inaugural Senior Bowl. Campbell completed the most passes in the game, even more than MVP Travis Tidwell, going 18 of 37 for 147 yards, but it was not enough as the Yanks lost, 22–13. After the game, it was announced that three Southwest Conference schools, including Texas, would immediately cut off financial support to participants in the game because they accepted the $343 cash reward for playing. Though all of the players, including Doak Walker, had completed their eligibility, they were continuing to receive scholarships through the spring 1950 semester.\nProfessional football.\nIn May 1950, Campbell was signed by the Eagles and went to training camp, and that summer he participated in the Chicago College All-Star Game, which the defending NFL Champion Eagles surprisingly lost. By the start of the 1950 season he'd been cut, and was hired by the Paterson Panthers of the American Association. He played well, but the team went 4–4 and was forced to disband due to a financial dispute with one game remaining on the schedule. The league disbanded at the end of the year.\nLater life.\nIn January 1947, Campbell married his high school sweetheart, Doris Gracey and together they had four sons. In 1955, they moved to Odessa, Texas, where he worked as a salesman in the oil business. Campbell became a competitive golfer, becoming champion of the Odessa Country Club three times and entering several other local tournaments. He was divorced in 1995 in Odessa and he died Thursday, February 10, 2005, at Midland Memorial Hospital in Midland, Texas."

The first round winners advance in the winners' bracket to face regular season divisional champions in the second round, while first round losers play elimination games. The format means that one team from the North and two from the South will be left out of the field.\nSavannah State earned the tiebreaker for the S3 seed over North Carolina Central."

        "title": "Kenya at the Cricket World Cup",
        "text": "The Kenya national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Kenya in international cricket matches. Kenya was part of the East Africa cricket team which became an associate member of the ICC in 1966, and competed in the first World Cup. Kenya first competed as an independent nation at the 1996 Cricket World Cup, after which they were given full ODI status, which they held until 2014, when they finished fifth in the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. Kenya's best performance at the Cricket World Cup was in 2003, where they reached the semi-finals.\nCricket World Cup Record.\nWhite: Group/Round-Robin Stage\n1996 World Cup.\n1996 was Kenya's debut at the Cricket World Cup, and they were drawn against co-hosts Sri Lanka, and also Australia, India, West Indies and Zimbabwe. Kenya beat the West Indies, but lost their other 4 games, and were eliminated after the group stages.\n1999 World Cup.\nIn the 1999 World Cup itself, they were placed in the same first round group as hosts England, and India, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. They lost all five of their games in the tournament.\n2003 World Cup.\nThe 2003 Cricket World Cup was to be Kenya's finest moment in international cricket to date. The tournament was to be held in South Africa, with Kenya hosting their two matches against Sri Lanka and New Zealand.\nGroup stage.\nThe tournament started with a defeat to South Africa, but Kenya bounced back with a four wicket win over Canada in Cape Town. New Zealand forfeited their match against Kenya in Nairobi due to safety concerns, but Sri Lanka did visit Nairobi and lost by 53 runs. The tournament continued, back in South Africa, with a win over Bangladesh and a defeat to the West Indies. Kenya had done enough to qualify for the Super Six stage, becoming the first non-test nation to progress beyond the first round of the World Cup.\nSuper 6 Stage.\nIn the Super Six stage, they lost to India and Australia, but beat Zimbabwe by seven wickets, qualifying for the semi-final.\nSemi-final stage.\nIn the semi-final, Kenya lost to India by 91 runs.\nThe fairytale ended for the Kenyan team, the only non-Test-playing nation to ever make a World Cup semi-final. Sachin Tendulkar (83 from 101 balls, 5 fours, 1 six) and Sourav Ganguly (111 from 114 balls, 5 fours, 5 sixes), batted the Kenyans out of the game as India careered to a total of 270 (4 wickets, 50 overs). Under the Durban lights, the potent Indian seam attack of Zaheer Khan (3/14 in 9.2 overs), the experienced Javagal Srinath (1/11 in 7 overs) and Ashish Nehra (2/11 in 5 overs) careered through the Kenyan top order. Kenya were bowled out for 179 (all out, 46.2 overs), with only Steve Tikolo (56 from 83 balls, 5 fours, 2 sixes) putting up any significant resistance.\n2007 World Cup.\nKenya hosted Division One of the World Cricket League at three grounds in Nairobi, playing against Bermuda, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands and Scotland. Kenya also won this event, beating Scotland in the final. This was followed by the 2007 World Cup, Kenya's fourth World Cup. Kenya beat Canada in the first round, but lost to England and New Zealand, thus missing out on the Super Eight stage.\nKenya captain Steve Tikolo was named man of the match after playing all the way through the chase, coming in at 52 for two, with David Obuya and Ravindu Shah dismissed in single figures with a strike rate below 25. Nevertheless, only Canada's captain John Davison conceded less than 3.5 runs an over, as the three first Canadian bowlers, Umar Bhatti, Anderson Cummins and Henry Osinde conceded 16 wides among the 107 runs in 22.2 overs. The Kenyan spinners, on the other hand, took five for 78 from 29 overs, \"strangling the scoring rate.\" Cummins became the second man to play World Cup cricket for two different countries, having represented West Indies in 1992.\nEd Joyce's second fifty in as many matches helped England qualify for the Super Eights in what was essentially a play-off match, eliminating 2003 semi-finalists Kenya. Steve Tikolo came in at four after James Anderson had removed both openers, and though he made his 20th half-century, none of his team-mates passed 20. Extras were the second-highest contributor, with six wides and eight no-balls, most of the latter coming from Sajid Mahmood and Andrew Flintoff, who bowled three no-balls each. Flintoff did get Tikolo out with a yorker, while three of Kenya's players were run out as they were bowled out on the last ball of the rain-reduced innings.\nKenya's opening bowler Peter Ongondo extracted \"tennis-ball bounce\" to remove Michael Vaughan for one with the 19th ball of the game; however, despite Ian Bell getting caught for 16, England had reduced the equation to 126 off 34.2 overs after Joyce and Bell's partnership. With Kevin Pietersen also getting a fifty, England made it through with ten overs to spare.\n2011 World Cup.\nKenya qualified for the 2011 Cricket World Cup, but failed to win a single match, being eliminated in the group stages.\nThe first match of Group A saw Kenya taking on the New Zealanders. Kenya won the toss and elected to bat first on a pitch which seemed to have a lot of runs. However, the New Zealanders started very well, restricting the Kenyans for runs throughout the first 6 overs. The pressure paid off as Tim Southee trapped Alex Obanda in front with the score at 16 after 7 overs. Fellow opener Seren Waters and Collins Obuya tried to rebuild but Hamish Bennett came into the attack and got Waters lbw to make the score 40/2. Bennett then ripped through the Kenyan batting and got 3 more wickets in double-quick time to reduce the Kenyans to 49/5. The shattered Kenyans then folded, with only Rakep Patel offering resistance with 16 not out as Southee and Jacob Oram finished off the tail to get Kenya all out for 69 in 23.5 overs.\nThe New Zealand openers started off quickly in their small chase, with Martin Guptill doing most of the early scoring. Brendon McCullum was bowled off a free hit but got into his stride and finished off the game with two successive boundaries, as New Zealand reached their target in just eight overs without losing any wicket, to complete a ten-wicket win.\nPakistan, who were on a poor run of form before this World Cup faced off against Kenya. Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi won the toss and elected to bat first but it was the Kenyan bowlers who struck early, getting opens Mohammad Hafeez and Ahmed Shehzad out early on, leaving Pakistan at 12/2 at the end of 7 overs. Kamran Akmal and Younis Khan then began a rebuilding partnership of 98, until Kamran fell shortly after reaching his half-century. Younis also reached a half-century and fell immediately, before Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal hit a rapid 118-run partnership, with the latter especially being severe on the bowlers in his 71 off 52 balls. Both men fell towards the end of the innings as Pakistan reached 317/7, helped quite substantially by the Kenyan bowling which conceded 46 extras.\nKenya started off solidly in their big chase, with openers Morris Ouma and Seren Waters adding 37 for the first wicket until a direct hit from Umar Akmal had the latter run out. The Kenyans fought during the first half of their innings, getting to 73/2 before Shahid Afridi bowled Steve Tikolo. He then ran through the lower middle order and the tail with ease, and ended up with figures of 5/16 from 8 overs as Kenya collapsed to 112 all out, with the only resistance offered by Collins Obuya's 47.\nAfridi took the best figures for a Pakistan bowler in the World Cup, with 5/16. Kenya bowled 37 wides, equaling the record set by the West Indies, also against Pakistan, in 1989.\nSri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga took a hat-trick, the second in his career. He became the first bowler to take two World Cup hat-tricks, and the fourth bowler to take two career ODI hat-tricks.\nCanada's win was their third-successive victory against Kenya and their second win in World Cup matches. They had previously beaten Bangladesh in the 2003 Cricket World Cup.\nKenya's total of 264 is their highest score in World Cup matches, beating their previous best of 254 against Sri Lanka in the 1996 Cricket World Cup."

        "text": "Kevin Michael Greene (born 31 December 1949) is a former New Zealand rugby union player and coach. He was the first coach of Glasgow Warriors, when the Glasgow District side professionalised in 1996.\nRugby Union career.\nProvincial career.\nA halfback, Greene represented Waikato at a provincial level.\nInternational career.\nHe was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, in 1976 and 1977. He played eight games for the All Blacks, but did not appear in any test matches.\nCoaching career.\nGreene was the coach of Waikato before finding himself in Scotland coaching amateur side Glasgow Academicals. During this time he also helped out coaching with Glasgow Academy, Greenock Wanderers and Clydebank Rugby Club.\nHe was to take charge of the fledgling professional side Glasgow Rugby, now Glasgow Warriors, as head coach.\nThis was a dual role with his coaching of Glasgow Academicals. He also was the last coach of Cities District, the combined Glasgow-Edinburgh district side, for the match against Australia in November 1996. The match was organised before the Scottish districts turned professional for the 1996-97 season; and this was the last time - and only incidence of the two professional teams - that Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby shared their players in a combined team outwith international squads; although some players also made the Combined Scottish Districts squad in Australia's next match.\nDuring his time managing Glasgow they entered the Heineken Cup for the first time in the 1997–98 season. Glasgow qualified out of the group stage but lost to Leicester in the quarterfinals, 19 points to 90 points.\nThe dual coaching role that Greene had between Glasgow Academicals and the professional side Glasgow Rugby caused friction with other amateur clubs. It was announced prior to the European Cup quarter final match that Greene would leave the Glasgow Rugby post after the Leicester match and that Keith Robertson would take over the Glasgow side in November 1997.\nGlasgow's flyhalf Calum MacGregor once gave this tribute of his boss: \"Kevin Greene, the Glasgow coach, is the kind of man who makes the players think for themselves, like Ian McGeechan, and I prefer that to the blood-and-thunder approach. I have enjoyed playing for Glasgow this year more than any other. I look around at the young guys in the team and they are keen and excited and that makes me feel good about the game. The players have a belief in it and a desire to win and I like that.\"\nGreene was noted for his eye for detail in coaching. He would even change the way players ran: 'He demands they run upright, elbows in to the waist, when they give and take the ball, and they are to pass high. The reason? An upright player doesn't need to break his stride pattern as he receives a ball, unlike one that has been taught to give and take a ball at waist height and whose hands will interfere with his lifting knees. And the eyes can remain on the opposition.'\nEven when leaving Glasgow to go home to New Zealand he still remained helpful to the Scottish professional side. He was to organise a training trip to New Zealand for the Glasgow Thistles; 22 players in the Glasgow District's age grades. Included in the 22 were Euan Murray and the long-term Warriors development coach Iain Monaghan.\nIn Super Rugby, he was assistant coach of the in 2001, and coach in 2002 and 2003."

        "text": "The 2014–15 NCAA Division I women's basketball season began in November and ended with the Final Four in Tampa, Florida, April 5–7. Practices officially began on October 3.\nThis was the final season in which NCAA women's basketball games were played in 20-minute halves. Beginning with the 2015–16 season, the women's game switched to 10-minute quarters, the standard for FIBA and WNBA play.\nConference membership changes.\nThe 2014–15 season saw the final wave of membership changes resulting from a major realignment of NCAA Division I conferences. The cycle began in 2010 with the Big Ten and the then-Pac-10 publicly announcing their intentions to expand. The fallout from these conferences' moves later affected a majority of D-I conferences.\nSeason outlook.\nPre-season polls.\nThe top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaches Polls.\nRegular season.\nConference winners and tournaments.\nThirty-one athletic conferences each end their regular seasons with a single-elimination tournament. The teams in each conference that win their regular season title are given the number one seed in each tournament. The winners of these tournaments receive automatic invitations to the 2015 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament. The Ivy League does not have a conference tournament, instead giving their automatic invitation to their regular season champion.\nPostseason tournaments.\nNCAA tournament.\nTournament upsets.\nFor this list, a \"major upset\" is defined as a win by a team seeded 7 or more spots below its defeated opponent.\nWomen's National Invitation tournament.\nAfter the NCAA Tournament field is announced, 64 teams were invited to participate in the Women's National Invitation Tournament. The tournament began on March 20, 2013, and ended with the final on April 6. Unlike the men's National Invitation Tournament, whose semifinals and finals are held at Madison Square Garden, the WNIT holds all of its games at campus sites.\nWNIT Semifinals and Final.\nPlayed at campus sites\nWomen's Invitational tournament.\nThe sixth Women's Basketball Invitational (WBI) Tournament began in March 2015 and will end with a best-of-three final scheduled for March 31, April 2, and April 5; the final went the full three games. This tournament featured 16 teams who were left out of the NCAA Tournament and NIT.\nWBI Semifinals and Final.\nPlayed at campus sites\nAward winners.\nAll-America teams.\nThe NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the Associated Press (AP), the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), the \"Sporting News\", and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nHowever, of the major selectors in women's basketball, only the AP divides its selections into separate teams. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), selects a single 10-member (plus ties) team, as does the USBWA. The NCAA does not recognize \"Sporting News\" as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\nWith that in mind, the following players were named to at least two of the three major teams:\nCoaching changes.\nA number of teams changed coaches during and after the season."

        "text": "The 1981–82 Yugoslav First Basketball League season was the 38th season of the Yugoslav First Basketball League, the highest professional basketball league in SFR Yugoslavia. The season ended with Cibona winning the league championship by beating Partizan two games to none in the playoffs final best-of-three series.\nThe season was another milestone for club basketball in Yugoslavia as the sport began to be played with playoffs at the end of the regular league season, meaning that postseason would determine the league champion rather than regular season as was the case prior to the 1981–82 campaign.\nKK Partizan finished the regular season on top with an 18–4 record just ahead of Cibona's 17–5; additionally, Partizan won both regular season games against Cibona. The same two teams made the playoff finals, having the home court advantage at every stage of the playoffs. Heading into the final series, Partizan had the home court advantage, but lost it after game 1 at Belgrade's Hala sportova in front of a packed crowd of 4,000—a hard-fought contest that visiting Cibona won 108–112 after triple overtime. Game 2 was played in Zagreb on Cibona's home court and Cibona won it assuredly to claim its first-ever Yugoslav title.\nNotable events.\nIntroduction of playoffs.\nThe season saw the playoffs introduced as a way of determining the Yugoslav First Federal Basketball League champion at the end of the regular season. The decision came on the heels of great debate within the country's basketball federation, KSJ, and Yugoslav coaching circles, and was initially somewhat controversial with many considering it jarring and/or unfair that an eight-placed team or even a Second League team could potentially become the season's champion through playoffs.\nAs for the European spots for FIBA Europe's competitions, the playoffs champion automatically qualified for a spot in the top-tier FIBA European Champions Cup while the Yugoslav Cup winner got a second-tier FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup spot. If the league and cup were won by the same team, the FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup went to the cup finalist. For the third-tier FIBA Korać Cup spots, the top four placed teams at the end of the regular season (excluding the champion and cup winner) received FIBA Korać Cup spots, meaning that qualification for the FIBA Korać Cup was still determined via the regular season and not the playoffs.\nPraja Dalipagić back in Partizan, Moka Slavnić in Partizan jersey.\nThe 1981–82 season featured the unusual sight of thirty-two-year-old Red Star Belgrade legendary point guard Moka Slavnić suiting up for their bitter crosstown rivals Partizan. Ever since leaving Red Star in acrimony four years earlier, Slavnić had been on such bad terms with the club's management that when he decided to return to his hometown in the twilight of his playing career, he controversially joined heated rivals Partizan instead of the club he made his name with and achieved legendary status in.\nSlavnić's Partizan debut took place in week 7 versus Budućnost due to administrative issues with his player registration. He immediately proved valuable, assisting and organizing on offense on a roster that also featured another legendary veteran—thirty-year-old Dražen Dalipagić, himself returning to Belgrade following a season abroad with Reyer Venezia. In the first six games of the season that Partizan played without Slavnić, the team had a 3–3 record while with Slavnić they recorded only one loss in the next 16 league games until the end of the regular season, grabbing top spot ahead of the playoffs with an 18–4 record.\nResults.\nOther source:\nPlayoff.\nThe first ever Yugoslav First League playoffs were played in the following format: \nThe top two teams from the 1981–82 Yugoslav Second League were KK Jugoplastika from Split and KK Kvarner from Rijeka. They thus faced Yugoslav First League clubs—8th placed KK Budućnost from Titograd and 7th placed KK Bosna from Sarajevo, respectively—with the winner of each game clinching a playoff spot.\nWinning roster.\nThe winning roster of Cibona:\nCoach: Mirko Novosel\nRelegation playoffs.\nSince teams from 9th to 11th place ended up with the same number of points, it was decided that relegation tournament in Kumanovo should have been played.\nSloboda Dita had finished last and was therefore relegated.\nQualification in 1982–83 season European competitions.\nFIBA European Champions Cup\nFIBA Cup Winner's Cup\nFIBA Korać Cup"

Since being in the act of shooting, Petrović got two free throws and proceeded to score both, winning the game and championship for his team. Next morning, the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia (KSJ) presidency reviewed the game on account the time expired prior to the foul being called and on account of refereeing irregularities. They decided to void the result, ordering a single-game title playoff at a neutral venue in Novi Sad. Šibenka decided to boycott the decision.

        "text": "The 1985–86 Yugoslav First Basketball League season was the 42nd season of the Yugoslav First Basketball League, the highest professional basketball league in SFR Yugoslavia.\nNotable events.\nDražen Petrović's 112-point game.\nThe first week of fixtures on 5 October 1985 included a game in Zagreb at Dom Sportova's small hall between Cibona and visiting Smelt Olimpija—a contest that would go down in history for Dražen Petrović's Yugoslav Basketball League single-game scoring record as well as the strange circumstance that allowed it to happen.\nDue to Olimpija general manager Radovan Lorbek reportedly being late with submitting a registration letter to the Yugoslav Basketball Federation (KSJ) headquarters in Belgrade, the visiting team failed to fulfill their player-registration administrative obligations in time, rendering their entire first team roster ineligible for the regular season opening game. Olimpija were thus forced to field players from their youth system. Sending out juniors (age 18 and under) would've normally been the first option; however, since Olimpija had no junior team within their youth system that year, they had to go to an even younger age group—making do with cadets (16 and under). In the end, the team they took to Zagreb consisted of players born in 1968 and younger, including Igor Đurović, Matjaž Strmole, Jože Maček, Dag Kralj, Tine Erjavec, Jure Zorčič, Gregor Stražiščar, Andrej Novina, and Tine Merzelj.\nCibona for their part decided to send out a mixed roster consisting of players from their youth system plus their twenty-one-year-old superstar Dražen Petrović who used the opportunity of playing against inferior opposition to shatter Radivoj Korać's single-game Yugoslav League scoring record from 1962 when Korać scored 74 points for OKK Beograd versus Mladost Zagreb. In a 158–77 blowout in front of 2,000 people against the hapless Ljubljana team, Petrović scored 112 points on 40 for 60 field goal shooting that included 10 for 20 three-point shooting. He did so despite reportedly announcing, before the game, his intention of leaving the floor once he reached Korać's 74 points. Petrović was one of only five Cibona players to get on the score sheet that day, the other four were eighteen-year-old Dražen Anzulović with 16 points, eighteen-year-old Vladimir Rizman with 14, nineteen-year-old Ivo Nakić with 12, and Ivan Šoštarec with 4.\nCibona's 20-game winning streak.\nCibona dominated the regular season with only a single loss in the entire campaign, thus equaling the feat that had previously been managed only twice in Yugoslav League history — Zadar in 1974–75 and Crvena Zvezda in 1949. Behind young Dražen Petrović's scoring exploits (his regular-season scoring average was 43.3 points per game), the Zagreb club opened the league campaign with twenty straight wins before finally losing, 102–100, away to Šibenka (Petrović's old team) in the second last game of the regular season — a contest in which Petrović recorded 52 points, but Šibenka still eked out a win led by Predrag Šarić who scored 36 points.\nBudućnost's surprise success.\nBudućnost was the season's biggest surprise package. Playing only its 6th season in the country's top-flight basketball league, the unfancied side from Titograd that had never had a positive season record (more wins than losses) in its previous five seasons was now nearly unbeatable at home, losing only one game in front of its home fans — against powerful Cibona. Led by veterans Duško Ivanović (28.5 ppg season average), Dragan Ivanović, , Milatović, and Jadran Vujačić, the team also received a great contribution from its rising star Žarko Paspalj who turned 20 years of age over the course of the season.\nRegular season.\nClassification.\nNOTE: KK Smelt Olimpija was sanctioned by the board of Yugoslav Basketball Association (KSJ) because club's fans were causing incidents on the game against KK Zadar in Tivoli Hall on October 14. The match was cancelled by the referee. Final decisions were deduction of one point from Olimpija, the game was registered as a 2-0 win for Zadar and Olimpija had to play three home matches in another town. \nWith the same amount of points, KK Rabotnički had better head-to-head score against KK Olimpija, thus Olimpija was relegated. \nResults.\nOther source:\nPlayoffs.\nOnly the top four placed league table teams qualified for the playoffs quarterfinal automatically.\nTeams placed fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth were joined by the top two Second League teams for an 8-team play-in round. The winner of each best-of-three series advanced to the playoffs quarterfinal round.\nFinals.\nGame 1: Cibona vs Zadar 84-70.\nCibona dominated the opening game of the final series on its home court with strong outside shooting — behind Dražen Petrović's 28 points, Danko Cvjetićanin's 22, and Sven Ušić's 16.\nStill, the visitors from Zadar could find some comfort in their defensive play due to managing to limit Cibona to 84 points — well below 116.8 points per game Cibona had been scoring in their prior six games of the 1986 Yugoslav League playoffs.\nGame 2: Zadar vs Cibona 84-73.\nZadar won game two on its home court at Jazine, having led comfortably throughout the entire contest (halftime score was 42-30). Receiving balanced scoring from its roster — Petar Popović and Veljko Petranović with 15 points each, Ante Matulović with 14, Draženko Blažević 12, Darko Pahlić 11, and Ivica Obad 10 — Zadar's win was never in question.\nCibona's best player Dražen Petrović didn't appear in game two somewhat controversially with the official reason provided by the club that he got injured during warm-up right before the game. There has been rife speculation after the game as well as in the years and decades since in the Yugoslav press and public that—having been so convinced of their superiority over Zadar as well as their dominance on their Dom Sportova home court in Zagreb where at that point they hadn't lost a competitive game for more than three years since March 1983—Cibona essentially tanked game two because they wanted to celebrate the Yugoslav league title in front of their fans at home in game three.\nGame 3: Cibona vs Zadar 110-111 2OT.\nWith the best-of-three series tied at one apiece, the deciding game 3 was played on Cibona's home court, Dom Sportova, on Saturday, 26 April 1986.\nSupported by over 10,000 fans, despite plenty of nervy play from the home team (Dražen Petrović getting a technical for accosting the referee and Franjo Arapović getting ejected for striking Darko Pahlić), Cibona had the early lead behind Cvjetićanin's scoring (got 22 of Cibona's 42 first half points) while Dražen Petrović, who returned to the squad after controversially sitting out game two, also scored actively. Still, Zadar kept chasing with most of its first half points coming from their twenty-six-year-old captain Veljko Petranović and twenty-two-year-old center Stojko Vranković. The team's leading scorer, shooting guard Petar Popović, on the other hand, was completely out of the shooting rhythm — missing his first three shots, getting benched seven minutes into the game by head coach Vlade Đurović, and ending up scoreless at halftime. Cibona was up 42-37 at halftime.\nPopović finally managed to get on the scoresheet five minutes into the second half, which led to him starting to score in bunches. Still, Cibona led continuously and midway through the second half, with ten minutes to go, they were up by eleven points — 71-60 — its highest lead of the game. Zadar made one last push and managed to catch up with three-point shooting to tie up the score 85-85 at the end of regulation. The visiting team even had the last possession, but failed to score.\nMidway through the overtime, Cibona's leader Dražen Petrović fouled out with his fifth personal foul; leaving the contest with 39 points. At the end of overtime, the score was tied again, 96-96. In the second overtime, with Dražen Petrović no longer on the court, the game turned into a shooting duel between Cvjetićanin and Popović before eventually being decided by Popović's two three-pointers as Zadar pulled out a famous 110-111 victory on the road. Zadar's scoring was led by Popović who scored 35 points (all of them in the second half and two overtimes), while on Cibona's side, beside Dražen Petrović's 39 points (7 three-pointers), Cvjetićanin added 37 points (5 three-pointers).\nIt was Cibona's first home loss in a competitive game in over three years in all competitions — with their previous home loss occurring on 16 March 1983 in the Yugoslav League versus Red Star Belgrade. And it was a costly loss for Cibona because it meant that despite winning the FIBA European Champions Cup that season, the club didn't get to compete in the next season's edition of the competition.\nThe winning roster of Zadar:\nCoach: Vlade Đurović\nQualification in 1986-87 season European competitions.\nFIBA European Champions Cup\nFIBA Cup Winners' Cup\nFIBA Korać Cup"

Initially 35 teams were allocated vacancies to enter the competition at the 'Qualification phase', with another 14 teams (after 2 teams withdraw) joining from the Women's CEV Cup entering the competition at the 'Main phase' stage (as per 'Round composition' below).\nOn 12 June 2014, a drawing of lots in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, determined the team's pairing for each match. Each team played a home and an away match with result points awarded for each leg (3 points for 3–0 or 3–1 wins, 2 points for 3–2 win, 1 point for 2–3 loss). After two legs, the team with the most result points advanced to the next round. In case the teams were tied after two legs, a was played immediately at the completion of the second leg. The Golden Set winner is the team that first obtains 15 points, provided that the points difference between the two teams is at least 2 points (thus, the Golden Set is similar to a tiebreak set in a normal match).\nMain phase.\nIn this stage of the competition, the sixteen qualified teams of the Qualification phase were joined by the losing teams from the 2014–15 Women's CEV Cup. From the 16 teams expected to join from the CEV Cup, 14 teams entered the competition, after the withdraw of 2 teams. That meant two teams received a 16th Final bye."

The society established Cuba's first free public library, first children's library, and first course of instruction for librarians.\nEarly history.\nModeled after similar Spanish women's social organizations, the Lyceum was founded in Havana by Berta Arocena, Carmen Castellanos, Dulce María Castellanos, Carmelina Guanche, Rebeca Gutiérrez, Matilde Martínez Márquez, Lillian Mederos, Reneé Méndez Capote, Sarah Méndez Capote, María Teresa Moré, Alicia Santamaría, Ofelia Tomé, and María Josefa Vidaurreta in 1929. Arocena served as the first president. Similar liberal and cultural societies of the period included the Union Club and the Vedado Tennis Club, which likewise predominantly consisted of Cuban members.\nMerger.\nIn 1939, Lyceum merged with \"Tennis de Señoritas\" and was renamed the Lyceum and Lawn Tennis Club. The organization's concentration included \"education, public service, art, music, and democratic organization\". It published a monthly magazine, \"Revista Lyceum\", of which Mirta Aguirre served as assistant editor-in-chief. University of Havana professor Piedad Maza served as the magazine's editor-in-chief from 1949 until its final issue in 1955. The Lyceum founded the country's first free public library and Cuba's first children's library, as well as offering the first librarian training class. The Lyceum also hosted notable art events in its exhibition hall, such as those of Pablo Picasso (in 1942) and Lourdes Gomez Franca (1957, 1960).\nDissolution and legacy.\nThe government of Fidel Castro disbanded the society in 1968 and many of its members were exiled to other countries. The Cuban Women's Club (1968-), formed in Miami, Florida, US, is modeled after the Lyceum and Lawn Tennis Club."

The four most important cycling nations of the time, Spain, Belgium, France and Italy, each sent a national team with fourteen cyclists. There were also five smaller national teams: a combined Luxembourg/Swiss team, a Dutch team, a German team, a British team, and a team of international cyclists, all with eight cyclists. Finally, there were five regional teams, also of eight cyclists each. Altogether, 128 cyclists started the race.\nJacques Anquetil, the winner of the 1957 Tour de France, had won the 1960 Giro d'Italia earlier that year. Anquetil was tired, and skipped the Tour. This made Roger Rivière the French team leader, and the big favourite for the Tour victory."

During the game, he completed 13 of 25 passes for 281 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. Rudolph remained the starter for the final two games, including the 2015 Cactus Bowl victory against Washington.

On March 15, 2018, he participated at Oklahoma State's pro day and completed the three-cone drill, short shuttle, broad jump, and ran passing drills. He met with scouts and team representatives from the Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Giants, and Los Angeles Chargers privately after completing his pro day. He attended private workout and visits with the New England Patriots, Buffalo Bills, New Orleans Saints, Cincinnati Bengals, Steelers, New York Giants, and Chargers. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Rudolph was projected to be a second round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the sixth best quarterback prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com, Scouts Inc., and \"Sports Illustrated\".\nPittsburgh Steelers.\n2018 season.\nThe Steelers selected Rudolph in the third round (76th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Steelers traded their third-round (79th overall) and seventh-round (220th overall) picks to the Seattle Seahawks in order to move up three spots and select Rudolph with the 76th overall pick. Rudolph was the sixth quarterback selected in 2018.\nOn May 23, 2018, the Steelers signed Rudolph to a four-year, $3.92 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $932,264.\nThroughout training camp, Rudolph competed against Landry Jones and Joshua Dobbs for the backup spot behind Ben Roethlisberger. Head coach Mike Tomlin ultimately named Rudolph the third quarterback, as Jones was released. Rudolph did not receive a single snap in the 2018 season.\n2019 season.\nDuring the preseason, Rudolph was named the second quarterback behind Roethlisberger, eclipsing Dobbs after multiple successful preseason performances.\nDuring Week 2 against the Seahawks, Rudolph relieved an injured Roethlisberger in the second half and threw for 112 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the Steelers narrowly lost 28-26. Following the announcement that Roethlisberger would miss the rest of the season due to season-ending elbow surgery, Rudolph became the Steelers' starting quarterback. Rudolph made his first NFL start in Week 3 against the San Francisco 49ers. He threw for 174 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the 24–20 road loss. In the next game against the Bengals, Rudolph recorded his first win as a starter with 229 passing yards and two touchdowns in the 27–3 victory. The following week against the Baltimore Ravens, he suffered a concussion after being hit by Ravens safety Earl Thomas and was temporarily knocked unconscious, being relieved by Steelers third-string quarterback Devlin Hodges. Rudolph was cleared from concussion protocol on October 16, 2019. He returned to face the Miami Dolphins and threw for 251 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the 27–14 victory.\nIn Week 11 against the Cleveland Browns, with eight seconds left in regulation, Rudolph was involved in a brawl with several players from both teams. Rudolph completed a pass to running back Trey Edmunds. Myles Garrett of the Browns then tackled Rudolph late, after the pass had been completed. While the two were entangled on the ground, Rudolph pushed down and away on Garrett's helmet to get him off. Garrett then grabbed at Rudolph's helmet and removed it. When Rudolph ran after Garrett, Garrett struck Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's own helmet.\n During and after this altercation, additional players came into the fray and further fighting occurred. Rudolph finished with 221 passing yards, a touchdown, and four interceptions as the Steelers lost 21–7. Three players were ejected and later suspended for the incident, particularly Garrett who was suspended for the remainder of the 2019 season. For his role in the scuffle, Rudolph was fined $50,000 by the league. Rudolph later declined to file criminal charges, calling the situation an NFL matter. Garrett claimed that Rudolph used a racial slur in the build-up to the altercation, but the NFL investigation found no evidence to support Garrett's claim.\nIn the following week against the still-winless Bengals, Rudolph struggled again, throwing for 85 yards and an interception before being benched for Devlin Hodges in the third quarter who led the Steelers to a 16–10 comeback victory. Two days later, Mike Tomlin announced that Hodges would remain the starting quarterback for the following week's game against Cleveland. During Week 16 against the New York Jets, Rudolph came into the game after struggles from Hodges in the second quarter, but later suffered a shoulder injury and left the game in the fourth quarter. During the game, Rudolph threw for 129 yards and a touchdown. Without Rudolph, the Steelers lost 10–16. It was revealed that he suffered a sternoclavicular joint dislocation in the shoulder and was placed on injured reserve on December 24, 2019.

Rudolph also made appearances in relief of Roethlisberger in the 4th quarter of blowout wins against the Browns, Bengals, and Jacksonville Jaguars.\nOn December 29, 2020, with the Steelers already locking up the AFC North, head coach Mike Tomlin announced that Rudolph would start the season finale against the Browns in order to rest Roethlisberger. In that game, Rudolph threw for 315 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the 24–22 road loss.\n2021 season.\nRudolph signed a one-year contract extension with the Steelers on April 29, 2021.

Rudolph started again the following week, completing 18 of 24 passes for 274 yards in a 30–23 victory over the Seahawks.\nAlthough Pickett recovered from his injury, the Steelers opted to start Rudolph in a must-win scenario against the Baltimore Ravens. In the game, he completed 18 of 20 passes for 152 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions in a 17–10 victory and set a single-game Steelers record for completion percentage.

The first round was played during the FIFA international dates of 23–31 March 2015. CONCACAF announced the full format details on 12 January 2015.\nThe United States failed to qualify for the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986 after a surprise defeat by Trinidad and Tobago. As a result, Panama reached the World Cup for the first time in their history.\nFormat.\nThe qualification structure was as follows:\nEntrants.\nAll 35 FIFA-affiliated national teams from CONCACAF entered qualification. The seeding – used to draw the first four rounds of the qualifiers – was based on the FIFA World Rankings of August 2014 (shown in parentheses).\nSchedule.\nThe schedule of the competition was as follows.\nThe inter-confederation play-offs were scheduled to be played between 6–14 November 2017.\nFirst round.\nThe draw for the first round was held on 15 January 2015, 19:40 EST (), at the W Hotel at Miami Beach, Florida, United States.\nSecond round.\nThe draw for the second round was held on 15 January 2015, 19:40 EST (), at the W Hotel at Miami Beach, Florida, United States.\nThird round.\nThe draw for the third round was held as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw on 25 July 2015, starting 18:00 MSK (), at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nFourth round.\nThe draw for the fourth round was held as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw on 25 July 2015, starting 18:00 MSK (), at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nFifth round.\nAs with every World Cup qualification campaign since 1998, CONCACAF held a six-team, home-and-away round-robin group known as the 'Hexagonal', or 'Hex', as its final and decisive round.

        "text": "The men's sprint cycling event at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place from 21 to 24 September and was one of the nine cycling events at the 1988 Olympics. There were 25 competitors from 25 nations. After the 1984 Games had featured a humongously bloated 34-cyclist, 11-round, 63-match competition, the competition size was cut down by restricting nations to one cyclist yet again (the rule in place from 1928 to 1956 and in 1976 and 1980) and instituting a qualifying round: this reduced the format to 25 cyclists, 8 rounds (including the qualifying round), and 29 matches (not included the time trials in the qualifying round). The event was won by Lutz Heßlich of East Germany, the 1980 gold medalist who was unable to compete in 1984 due to the Soviet-led boycott. Soviet cyclist Nikolai Kovsh took silver, the best result to date for the Soviets. Gary Neiwand of Australia earned bronze; for both the Soviets and Australians, it was the first medal in the event since 1972.\nBackground.\nThis was the 19th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. None of the quarterfinalists from 1984 returned. The East German team was in the height of its dominance of the event, rising in the 1970s, peaking in the late 1980s, and continuing into the 1990s. The last nine medalists at the World Championships (gold, silver, and bronze in 1985, 1986, and 1987) had all been East German. Lutz Heßlich had won in 1985 and 1987 and finished second in 1986; he had also won the Olympic gold medal in 1980 (not competed in 1984 due to the Soviet-led boycott). When he was chosen to represent East Germany, he was an overwhelming favorite—everyone who had challenged him in the last few years was unable to compete due to the one-cyclist-per-nation rule that had been resurrected after the 1984 Games had allowed two per nation.\nBolivia and Ecuador each made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its 19th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis sprint competition involved a series of head-to-head matches along with the new qualifying round of time trials. There were five main match rounds, with two repechages. Only one-round repechages were used.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nLutz Heßlich set a new record with 10.395 seconds in the qualifying round."

        "text": "In 1909, although cyclists were able to register for the Tour with a sponsor, they were still considered to be riding as individuals. In the 1910 Tour de France, they competed for the first time in teams.\nThe cyclists were not so enthusiastic about the inclusion of the Pyrenées, and there were less participants: 110 instead of 150 in 1909. There were three teams with 10 cyclists each, including all the favourites for the overall victory: Alcyon, Le Globe and Legnano. The French team \"La Française\" decided not to join, but allowed their cyclists to ride for the Italian Legnano team. The other 80 cyclists rode as individuals, this was called the \"isolés\" category."

Additionally, 60 cyclists started as \"touriste-routiers\", most of them French. Some of them were grouped in regional teams.\nOne of the notable cyclists was Alfredo Binda, riding in the Italian national team. He had dominated the Giro d'Italia in the recent years, winning the 1925, 1927, 1928 and 1929 editions; in 1929 he had done so by winning eight consecutive stages. For the 1930 Giro d'Italia, he was paid money not to compete, so he started in the Tour de France that year. The French team was captained by Victor Fontan, who had been leading the 1929 Tour de France until he had to abandon the race due to mechanical problems. The Belgian team had Jef Demuysere as the favourite."

Then there were the individuals: each country also sent four cyclists who rode as individuals, but could take over the place of another cyclists if they dropped out. Spain only sent three cyclists, and Swiss sent four individual cyclists even though they did not have a national team, so 23 individual cyclists were racing. Finally, there was the touriste-routiers category, in which 30 cyclists participated. In total this made 93 cyclists. Split up by nationality, there were 41 French, 13 Italian, 12 Belgian, 12 German, 11 Spanish and 4 Swiss cyclists.\nThe French team looked very strong, as it contained the three winners of the last five Tours, Antonin Magne, Georges Speicher and André Leducq, in addition to climber René Vietto and Maurice Archambaud, who had led the general classification for a long time in 1933. In addition, they had Roger Lapébie and Charles Pélissier riding as individuals, which meant that they could take the place of a French team member dropping out.\nOf the other teams, the Belgian and Italian teams seemed most likely to challenge the French."

Time-slots varied from 15 minutes to 30 minutes, and it aired without commercials, as United States television was still an experimental service. According to the section \"Radio Dial Log\" in the August 20, 1931 edition of \"The New York Sun\", one of the episodes featured a description by Harry Von Zell and Bill Schudt Jr, with Jimmie deForrest as the referee. None of the episodes still exist, as it aired live, and practical methods to record live television did not exist until late 1947.

He then won his next two matches in straight sets against Adrian Mannarino and Feliciano López (overtaking Tim Henman's record of 496 career wins to have the most career wins in the Open Era for a British man) but lost in the semifinal stage to Djokovic in straight sets.\nMurray also participated in the doubles alongside Thanasi Kokkinakis and they both won their opening match against the fourth seeds Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecău but lost their next match against Marcin Matkowski and Nenad Zimonjić.\nMiami Open.\nMurray again faced Donald Young in his opening match and defeated him in straight sets before beating Santiago Giraldo in straight sets to avenge his defeat in the 2014 Madrid Open. He then defeated Kevin Anderson in three sets to record his 500th career win in the ATP World Tour, becoming the first British man in the Open Era to do so. He then reached the final after defeating Dominic Thiem in three sets and Tomáš Berdych in straight sets. He then lost the final to Djokovic in three sets (who won a record fifth Miami title) and was again broken to love in the third and deciding set, having received a bagel during his defeat to Djokovic in the Australian Open final.\nSpring Clay Court season and French Open.\nBavarian International Tennis Championships.\nMurray did not participate in the Monte-Carlo Masters due to his marriage to his longtime girlfriend Kim Sears, so he began his Clay Court season in the Bavarian International Tennis Championships at Munich. He defeated Mischa Zverev in straight sets and then reached his first ever Clay Court final after defeating Lukáš Rosol in three sets and Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets, completing both matches in a single day after his match with Rosol was suspended by rain in the previous day. He then won his first title on Clay by defeating Philipp Kohlschreiber in three sets, requiring tiebreakers to win both the first and third sets. This made him the first British player to win a tour level Clay Court title since Buster Mottram in 1976.\nMurray paired up with Jean-Julien Rojer in the doubles and they both upset the third seeds Lukáš Rosol and Raven Klaasen and then beat Rameez Junaid and Adil Shamasdin to reach the semifinals where they lost to the top seeds Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares, in what was Murray's third match of the day after his singles victories over Rosol and Bautista Agut.\nMadrid Open.\nHe then took his newfound form on Clay to the Madrid Open, beating Kohlschreiber again in three sets in his opening match after breaking to love in the third set during an early morning match finishing at 3:00am. He then thrashed Marcel Granollers in straight sets, losing only two games, and then beat Milos Raonic (who was struggling with a foot injury) and Kei Nishikori both in straight sets to face Rafael Nadal in the final. He won his second straight Clay court title and his first Masters 1000 title on Clay by defeating Nadal in straight sets, his first victory over Nadal since the 2011 Japan Open and his first victory against Nadal on Clay after six previous defeats. By winning, he became only the fourth player to defeat Nadal in a clay court final, following Roger Federer, Djokovic and Horacio Zeballos.\nRome Masters.\nMurray beat Jérémy Chardy in straight sets but withdrew due to fatigue from the tournament before his next match against David Goffin, after playing nine matches in the space of ten days and his early morning match against Kohlschreiber in the Madrid Open.\nFrench Open.\nMurray then entered the French Open with a 10 match winning streak on Clay, extending that streak by beating Facundo Argüello in straight sets and João Sousa in four sets in his opening round matches. He next defeated Nick Kyrgios again in straight sets and then beat Jerémy Chardy and David Ferrer both in four sets to reach his third semifinal in the French Open. He faced Djokovic again and lost the first two sets, but won the next two sets to take the match into a deciding set during a two-day match delayed by a thunderstorm. However, he ultimately lost the match in five sets, putting an end to his 15 match winning streak on Clay.\nGrass Court season and Wimbledon.\nQueens Club Championships.\nMurray began his grass court season at Queen's Club. He won his first two matches in straight sets against Lu Yen-hsun and Fernando Verdasco before defeating Gilles Müller in three sets to reach the semifinals. Murray went on to win his 34th career title by defeating Victor Troicki and Kevin Anderson in straight sets both in a single day after his match with Troicki was suspended by rain. This was his fourth Queen's Club title, equalling the number of titles which John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick had won in the Open Era.\nIn the doubles, Murray paired up with Dominic Inglot but they both lost in the first round to Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares.\nWimbledon Championships.\nMurray drew Kazakh Mikhail Kukushkin in the opening round of the Wimbledon Championships. He won in straight sets, and also defeated Robin Haase in straight sets to reach the third round, where he played Andreas Seppi. Murray went two sets up but then lost six games in a row after Seppi had taken an injury timeout, before Murray had shoulder treatment and came back to win the final six games and the match.\nMurray reached the quarter-finals after a four-set victory over Ivo Karlović, and there beat Vasek Pospisil in straight sets to reach his sixth Wimbledon semi-final and set up a match against Roger Federer. However, after missing a break point opportunity against the Federer serve in the first game, Federer never faced another break point and managed to break Murray at the end of each set to win 7–5, 7–5, 6–4.\nDavis Cup World Group Quarterfinals.\nWith the Davis Cup Quarterfinals taking place at the Queen's Club, Murray won his first match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in straight sets. He then paired up with his elder brother and doubles specialist Jamie Murray in the doubles against Tsonga and Nicolas Mahut and despite losing the first set along with Murray sustaining a fall during the match, the two brothers eventually won the match in four sets. He then faced Gilles Simon in his next singles match and after initially being a set and a break down, he suddenly found his form again towards the end of the second set and eventually won in four sets, winning 12 of the last 15 games in the process (with Simon struggling from an ankle injury). With a 3–1 lead over France, this resulted in Great Britain reaching their first Davis Cup semifinal since 1981.\nUS Open Series.\nWashington Open.\nMurray was the top seed in the tournament and drew Teymuraz Gabashvili in the second round. Both players split the first two sets with Gabashvili winning the first set and Murray winning the second set. However, despite serving for the match at 5–4 in the third set, Murray was broken back and lost the match in three sets after a deciding tiebreaker. Murray also paired up with Daniel Nester in the doubles but they lost in the first round to the third seeds Rohan Bopanna and Florin Mergea in three sets.\nCanadian Open.\nMurray responded well from his shock defeat in the Washington Open by defeating Tommy Robredo in straight sets despite Robredo being a break up in the second set. This was then followed by straight sets victories over Gilles Müller in the third round and the defending champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (who had defeated Murray in the same stage the previous year en route to claiming the title) in the quarterfinals. He then faced Kei Nishikori again in the semifinals but despite the first set having three breaks in a row, Murray won the second set comfortably with a bagel, winning 12 of the last 13 points in the process, advancing to the final without dropping a set. This therefore ensured that he would overtake Roger Federer as the world number 2, returning to that ranking for the first time since 2013. He faced Djokovic again and both players split the opening two sets after three breaks of serve in each set, with Murray winning the first set and Djokovic taking the second set. Murray then broke for an early lead in the third set and despite saving 6 break points along with Djokovic saving 5 match points, Murray won the match in three sets, ending an eight-match losing streak against the world number 1. This was Murray's first victory over Djokovic since his Wimbledon victory in 2013, and the first time he had defeated Djokovic in the deciding set of a three-set match.\nIn the doubles, Murray paired up with 16-time doubles Grand Slam champion Leander Paes, and they beat Kevin Anderson and Jérémy Chardy in straight sets to set up a meeting with John Peers and Murray's elder brother Jamie Murray, marking the first time the two brothers had faced against each other in a professional match. However, despite having set points in the second-set tiebreaker, the elder Murray and Peers won the match in straight sets.\nCincinnati Masters.\nIn the second Master Series tournament of the US Hard Court season, Murray defeated Mardy Fish in the second round, and then beat both Grigor Dimitrov and Richard Gasquet in three-set matches, having to come from a set down on both occasions, while Dimitrov had served for the match in the deciding set. In the semi-final he lost to defending champion Roger Federer in straight sets, and after Federer went on to win the tournament this result saw Murray drop back to number 3 in the rankings.\nUS Open.\nMurray drew Nick Kyrgios in the first round and while he won the first two sets, Kyrgios won the third set, his first against Murray having lost their last three meetings in straight sets, before losing in four sets. Murray then faced Adrian Mannarino in the second round and unexpectedly dropped the first two sets before finding his form and winning the next three sets to prevail in five sets, matching Roger Federer for winning 8 matches from 2 sets down. Murray then beat Thomaz Bellucci in straight sets, dropping his serve only once in the match, to face Kevin Anderson in the fourth round. However, while Murray easily won their last meeting in the Queens Club final, Anderson's serve this time proved too much for Murray as he took the first set in a tiebreaker and then broke Murray in the second set for a two set to love lead. While Murray battled back to take the third set in a tiebreaker, Anderson won the match in four sets to reach his first Grand Slam quarterfinal without dropping a point in the last tiebreaker. This ended Murray's five-year run of 18 consecutive Grand Slam Quarterfinals (not counting his withdrawal from the 2013 French Open) since his third round loss to Stan Wawrinka in the 2010 US Open.\nDavis Cup and End of Season.\nDavis Cup World Group Semifinals.\nPlaying against Australia in the semifinals of the Davis Cup World Group in Glasgow, Andy Murray won both his singles rubbers in straight sets, against Thanasi Kokkinakis and Bernard Tomic. \nHe also partnered his brother Jamie, and they won in five sets against the pairing of Sam Groth and Lleyton Hewitt, the results guiding Great Britain to the Davis Cup final for the first time since 1978.\nShanghai Masters.\nAndy Murray reached the semifinals after victories against Steve Johnson and John Isner, before defeating Tomáš Berdych in straight sets including a run of nine games in a row. In the semifinals he lost to Novak Djokovic for the fifth time in the season, but the result along with Federer's early exit from the tournament ensured that Murray returned to the No. 2 ranking.\nParis Masters.\nMurray reached the quarter-finals for the loss of just four games, with victories against Borna Ćorić and David Goffin, before defeating Richard Gasquet in three sets to reach his first semi-final at the Paris Masters, becoming only the fourth person to reach the semi-finals or better at least once at all nine Masters tournaments. He then beat David Ferrer in straight sets, including a run of the last five games, but lost to Novak Djokovic in the final for the sixth time in the season.\nATP World Tour Finals.\nMurray had qualified for the Tour Finals and was seeded second, drawn in the same group as Stanislas Wawrinka, Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer. He beat Ferrer in his opening match, but lost both his other matches and was eliminated from the tournament at the group stage. However, Roger Federer lost in the final, ensuring that Murray finished the year as World No. 2 for the first time in his career.\nDavis Cup World Group Final.\nAfter Kyle Edmund had lost the first singles rubber, Murray's victory over Ruben Bemelmans in straight sets pulled Great Britain level in the final, played on indoor clay courts at Ghent. He then partnered his brother Jamie in a four-set victory over the pairing of Steve Darcis and David Goffin, before defeating Goffin again in the reverse singles on Sunday, thus ensuring a 3-1 victory for Great Britain, their first Davis Cup title since 1936. Murray also became only the third person since the current Davis Cup format was introduced to win all eight of his singles rubbers in a Davis Cup season, after John McEnroe and Mats Wilander.\nAll matches.\nSingles matches.\n \nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nMurray's 2015 singles tournament schedule was as follows:\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\n\"Ordered by number of wins\""

        "text": "The Mount Rainier Professional Baseball League was an independent, professional baseball league located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Operating in cities not served by Major League Baseball or their minor-league affiliates, the MRPBL had six franchise teams spread throughout the states of Washington, Oregon, and Montana.\nFounded in 2014, the league was divided into an Eastern and Western Division, with each team playing a 68-game regular-season schedule lasting from May through August.\nPlay ceased early on in the inaugural, 2015 season because the league was experiencing substantial financial difficulty. Owner and commissioner Mike Greene admitted that he was unprepared for the challenges of running the league. According to a press release, the league required an average of 300 fans per game in order to remain solvent. The league had trouble finding host families for players. Some teams' uniforms were not ready by the start of the season and they resorted to wearing other team's uniforms. Greene offered to grant free franchise rights to any potential owners and estimated that it would require an investment of approximately $70,000 in order to get a new team off the ground.\nOn June 1, 2015, the league issued a press release announcing that it would contract from six to four teams. Players from the remaining teams would be granted release from their contracts upon request and players on eliminated teams would be reassigned to the remaining teams, which would potentially require expanding the roster sizes. However, in the same press release, the league announced that the remaining teams' rosters would feature 24 players as opposed to the 25-man rosters the league had previously employed.\nThe teams folded soon afterwards as the league fell apart amid reports of players not being paid and teams not having gas money to travel to games. Only eight games were played during the abbreviated season."

Once again, the limit on cyclists per nation was raised to 2 (it had been 1 from 1928 to 1956, 2 from 1960 to 1972, and 1 again in 1976 and 1980). The event was won by Mark Gorski of the United States, the nation's first victory in the men's sprint and first medal in the event since John Henry Lake took bronze in 1900. The final was all-American, as Nelson Vails took silver, becoming the first Olympic cycling medalist of African descent. Japan earned its first medal in the men's sprint with Tsutomu Sakamoto's bronze. France's five-Games podium streak in the event ended.\nBackground.\nThis was the 18th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. The two returning quarterfinalists from 1980 were sixth-place finisher Heinz Isler of Switzerland and seventh-place finisher Kenrick Tucker of Australia. The Soviet-led boycott was particularly disruptive in this event, with the East German team dominant at the time. In particular, Lutz Heßlich was the best sprinter in the world for most of the 1980s and would have had a strong opportunity for three straight gold medals if not for the boycott; he had won the 1979 and 1983 World Championships and the 1980 Olympic gold, and would go on to win the 1985 and 1987 World Championships and the 1988 Olympic gold. The 1981 and 1982 World Champion and 1980 Olympic bronze medalist, Soviet Sergei Kopylov, was also kept out due to the boycott. Of the nations that were competing in Los Angeles, the host Americans were favored. Mark Gorski had beaten Kopylov multiple times in 1983. Nelson Vails was also a top contender.\nThe Cayman Islands and Chinese Taipei each made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its 18th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis sprint competition involved a series of head-to-head matches. With a larger field due to allowing two cyclists per nation instead of just one, the competition ballooned to 11 rounds: six main rounds and three repechages, two of which were two-round repechages.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nNo new world or Olympic records were set during the competition.\nResults.\n1/8 finals.\n1/8 final 2.\nThe second resulted in an appeal that determined all three riders were at fault.

        "text": "The 2015 Survivor Series was the 29th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It took place on November 22, 2015, at Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, which was the first time the state hosted the event. The event celebrated The Undertaker's 25th anniversary in WWE, his debut occurring at the 1990 Survivor Series. This was also the last Survivor Series event to be held before the reintroduction of the brand extension in July 2016, and the final Survivor Series event until to not carry the brand supremacy theme.\nNine matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Dean Ambrose to win the vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship; however, immediately after the match, Sheamus cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated Reigns to win the title. In another prominent match, The Undertaker teamed with Kane, thus reuniting The Brothers of Destruction, and defeated The Wyatt Family (represented by Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper).\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick event produced every November by WWE since 1987. The second longest running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four PPVs, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. Announced on July 13, 2015, the 2015 event was the 29th event in the Survivor Series chronology and was scheduled to be held on November 22, 2015, at Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, which was the first time the state hosted the event. In addition to airing on traditional PPV, the event was livestreamed on the WWE Network.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised nine matches, including one of the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nAfter Seth Rollins retained the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Hell in a Cell, a number one contender was determined the next night on \"Raw\". Eight wrestlers that were victorious at Hell in a Cell competed in singles matches, with the winners advancing to a fatal four-way match. Roman Reigns emerged victorious and was named the number one contender. However, on November 4, Rollins suffered multiple legitimate knee injuries at a live event in Dublin, Ireland; therefore, the title was vacated and a tournament was set up to crown a new champion. The tournament began on the November 9 episode of \"Raw\", with the semifinals and the final match scheduled for Survivor Series. Since Reigns was already the number one contender, Triple H offered him to pass directly into the finals if he would join The Authority. Reigns refused, preferring to go through the tournament. On the November 16 episode of \"Raw\", Reigns, Dean Ambrose, Intercontinental Champion Kevin Owens, and United States Champion Alberto Del Rio advanced to the semifinals with victories over Cesaro, Dolph Ziggler, Neville, and Kalisto respectively, setting up Reigns vs. Del Rio and Ambrose vs. Owens in the semifinals at the event.\nOn the November 2 episode of \"Raw\", Paige defeated Becky Lynch, Brie Bella, and Sasha Banks in a fatal four-way match to earn a Divas Championship match against Charlotte at Survivor Series.\nAt Hell in a Cell, The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper, Erick Rowan, and Braun Strowman) attacked The Undertaker after he had lost to Brock Lesnar in a Hell in a Cell match and carried him out of the arena. The following night on \"Raw\", Undertaker's brother Kane confronted The Wyatt Family but was also overpowered and carried out. On the November 9 episode of \"Raw\", The Undertaker and Kane returned and attacked The Wyatt Family. On the November 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", Wyatt challenged the brothers to a tag team match at Survivor Series against two handpicked members of The Wyatt Family, which they accepted.\nOn the October 22 episode of \"SmackDown\", Tyler Breeze made his WWE debut and attacked Dolph Ziggler. On the October 29 episode, after Ziggler defeated The Miz, Breeze attacked Ziggler. On the November 2 episode of \"Raw\", Breeze distracted Ziggler during a match with Kevin Owens, allowing Owens to get the victory. On the November 19 episode of \"SmackDown\", after Breeze defeated Zack Ryder, Ziggler attacked Breeze. Later in the show, a match between Ziggler and Breeze was scheduled for the event.\nISIS threat.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated an alleged threat by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) at the event. On November 21, 2015, the FBI released the statement, \"The FBI is aware of reports of an alleged threat that includes an Atlanta, Georgia venue and event. While we take all threats seriously, we do not have specific or credible information of an attack at this time. We have, however, made the proper notifications as we continue to work closely with our law enforcement and private sector partners to keep our community safe.\" \"International Business Times\" reported that the hacker group Anonymous were responsible for uncovering the information. WWE released a statement stating that the show would go on as scheduled. The show went on with no attack from ISIS.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley), Goldust, Neville, and Titus O'Neil faced The Cosmic Wasteland (Stardust, Konnor, and Viktor), The Miz, and Bo Dallas in a Survivor Series elimination tag team match. Viktor was eliminated by Goldust after a snap scoop powerslam. Konnor was eliminated by Bubba Ray after a side slam. Neville was eliminated by The Miz after a Bo-Dog by Dallas, followed by a Skull Crushing Finale by The Miz. The Miz was eliminated by Goldust with a schoolboy pin. Dallas was eliminated by O'Neil after a Clash of the Titus. Stardust was eliminated by D-Von after a 3-D by the Dudleyz, leaving Goldust, The Dudleyz, and Titus O'Neil as the survivors.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the semifinals in the tournament for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. In the first semifinal, Roman Reigns faced Alberto Del Rio (accompanied by Zeb Colter). In the end, as Del Rio leapt off the top rope, Reigns avoided Del Rio and executed a Spear on Del Rio to win the match and advance to the finals.\nNext, Dean Ambrose and Kevin Owens competed in the second semifinal match. In the end, as Owens attempted a Pop Up Powerbomb, Ambrose countered with a Hurricanrana and executed Dirty Deeds on Owens to win the match and advance to the finals.\nAfter that, The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods), Sheamus, and King Barrett faced The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), The Lucha Dragons (Kalisto and Sin Cara), and Ryback in a Survivor Series Elimination Tag Team match. Barrett was eliminated by Sin Cara after a Springboard Senton Bomb. Jimmy Uso was eliminated by Xavier Woods after a Backbreaker/Diving Double Foot Stomp combination with Kingston. Sin Cara was eliminated by Sheamus after a Brogue Kick. Big E was eliminated by Jey Uso after a Samoan Splash. After Big E was eliminated, Kingston and Woods left with Big E, eliminating Kingston and Woods. In the end, Sheamus received a Superkick from Jey Uso, a Hurricanrana from Kalisto and was eliminated by Ryback after Shellshocked, leaving Ryback, Kalisto and Jey as the survivors.\nIn the fourth match, Charlotte defended the WWE Divas Championship against Paige. During the match, Charlotte executed a Natural Selection on Paige, causing Paige to roll outside the ring. Paige climbed onto the barricade and taunted Charlotte, who also climbed up and executed a Spear on Paige. Charlotte, with her arms under the bottom rope, forced Paige to submit to the Figure Eight Leglock to retain.\nIn the fifth match, Tyler Breeze faced Dolph Ziggler. Breeze executed an Unprettier on Ziggler to win the match.\nIn the penultimate match, The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) fought Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper of The Wyatt Family, with Erick Rowan and Braun Strowman at ringside. Before the match, Undertaker and Kane performed a Double Chokeslam on Rowan. During the match, Undertaker and Kane performed a double Chokeslam on Strowman through a broadcast table. In the climax, Wyatt performed a Spider Walk to taunt his opponents, however, the Undertaker and Kane sat up simultaneously. Undertaker and Kane performed a Double Chokeslam on Wyatt and Harper before Undertaker pinned Harper after a Tombstone Piledriver to win the match.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose fought in the tournament final for the vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Ambrose leapt off the top rope but was intercepted by Reigns with a Superman Punch for a near-fall. Reigns performed a Spear on Ambrose for a near-fall. When Reigns attempted another Spear, Ambrose shoved him into the ring post and rolled him up for a near-fall. Ambrose executed Dirty Deeds on Reigns for a near-fall. Reigns performed another Spear on Ambrose to win the championship.\nAfter the match, Reigns celebrated in the ring with his newly won belt as pyrotechnics went off and confetti started falling in the arena. Triple H then came in the ring to congratulate Reigns, and offered him a handshake, but Reigns attacked him with a Spear. Sheamus then surprised Reigns with a Brogue Kick and cashed in his Money in the Bank contract. After Reigns kicked out of a pinfall attempt, Sheamus executed another Brogue Kick on Reigns to win the championship.\nReception.\nThe entire event and also \"particularly the event's finish, was widely met with negative reviews and utter disappointment from observers\", as described by Adam Silverstein of \"CBS Sports\". This was due to \"mundane matches that failed to captivate the audience\" and \"replicated a clunky finish from a pay-per-view just one year earlier\", resulting in \"a new World Heavyweight Champion in Sheamus that no one desires to see as part of the main event picture\". Silverstein highlighted the negative reaction of former WWE Champion Mick Foley, who was \"on the verge of becoming a former WWE fan\" after seeing how \"WWE has completely failed to capitalize not only on the male wrestlers drawing positive reactions from the crowd\" like \"Ziggler to Cesaro to Kevin Owens\", but also the \"female performers who are promoted well on the company's NXT developmental show but hardly given any time to 'get over'\" on the WWE main roster.\nAaron Oster of \"Rolling Stone\" declared that Survivor Series was \"a night that started with much promise, but ended in disappointment\". While the event was not \"awful\" due to a \"phenomenal\" entrance for the Undertaker on his 25th anniversary and three \"solid\" matches: the tournament semi-finals and the traditional Survivor Series tag match, \"the main event ... never connected and concluded in a way that cast a pall over the rest of the show – and quite possibly the company, too.\" This was because \"Sheamus cannot be the guy at the top of your card every night ... When a bad guy's biggest heel quality is his facial hair, it doesn't bode well.\" Also, it was \"hard to buy\" Roman Reigns as \"a plucky underdog being screwed over by the Authority\", when leading into the event Reigns \"still seemed like Vince McMahon's handpicked guy\". For other topics, Oster said the \"whole night was a tribute to the Undertaker\", who revived the \"dead\" crowd. Tyler Breeze's character was enhanced by using the Unprettier move, while Dolph Ziggler, in copying Shawn Michaels' dressing and mannerisms, \"just needs to figure out who he is, and quickly.\" Lastly, Oster questioned, \"If they are going to go completely random with the Survivor Series matches, are they really worth having?\"\nJames Cadwell of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" rated the Del Rio-Reigns semi-final three-and-a-half stars out of five, \"really good\" in spite of the \"outcome was never in doubt, removing some of the drama\". The Ambrose-Owens semi-final was rated three-and-a-quarter stars, due to both wrestlers being \"really good in the ring and they had strong chemistry building to the finish\". For the women's match, Caldwell wrote that it \"didn't generate enough of a reaction for a supposed grudge match\", and that \"it's so difficult for Charlotte’s character, like Reigns, to get sympathy in the babyface role when she towers over everyone and carries herself like she’s arrived\". The Undertaker participated in a \"fine nostalgic match\" that would be \"satisfying\" for fans of his, but for others an \"exhibition match victory over heels who were defined-down as henchmen\". The tournament final was too short to be rated over two-and-three-quarters stars, where \"WWE was just not going to waver from the plan to have Reigns win\" despite Ambrose enjoying a more favorable reaction. Lastly, Caldwell wrote that \"Lame Sheamus as champ\" was \"foreshadowed ... earlier in the show by having Sheamus act like an idiot so 'they'll never see it coming!'\"\nJohn Powell of \"Canadian Online Explorer\" wrote that Survivor Series was \"one of, if not \"the\", worst WWE pay-per-view of 2015\". It \"exposed all of the WWE's weaknesses\" and \"epitomized the existing WWE product. It is musty, tedious and worst of all, predictable.\" Powell singled out three main areas for criticism. Firstly, a \"slipshod, bumbling interview\" involving Dean Ambrose and a \"rambling\" Roman Reigns. Secondly, WWE keeping \"fans in the dark\" after \"Network streaming issues\". Thirdly, \"questionable booking\": the world champion heading out of the PPV was earlier \"portrayed as an out-of-step idiot, easily pinned and losing the match for his team after being abandoned by The New Day\"; \"claiming to have a 'Divas Revolution' then pushing nobody but Paige, The Bellas and Charlotte\"; the tournament final being a \"mediocre rush job\" at 9 minutes while the traditional Survivor Series match which was unhyped and had unannounced participants was given almost 20 minutes.\nWill Pruett of \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\" wrote that \"WWE produced an evening filled with flaws, ranging from giant to minor\" resulting in a \"broken universe\". \"The largest logical fallacy of Survivor Series was assuming anything being done on this show was being done for any reason other than 'it'll shock everyone' or 'that's how we've always done it'.\" Commenting on individual wrestlers, Pruett said that Roman Reigns, the 'supposed sympathetic star', 'lost all sympathy' by attacking Triple H, who \"hadn't been very evil when it came to Reigns\"; \"Alberto Del Rio has been noticeably disconnected in his matches since his return last month\"; and Sheamus \"could be a legitimate WWE Champion at some point\", but \"WWE seems to abuse his character.\" Lastly, Pruett felt that the Undertaker's entrance and match was \"a life raft of heartfelt joy\", \"in the sea of negativity and sadness WWE lead me to\" at the event.\nAftermath.\nThe post-Survivor Series \"Raw\" was the lowest rated non-holiday episode since 1997 and the first time \"Raw\" averaged less than three million viewers since then. On that episode, Roman Reigns confronted The Authority and demanded a rematch against Sheamus for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship that night. Triple H scheduled a rematch for in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match before leaving Reigns to face Rusev that night, which Reigns won by disqualification after King Barrett interfered. On the November 30 episode of \"Raw\", Reigns attacked Sheamus during his WWE World Heavyweight Championship celebrations before taking the belt with him. This prompted Sheamus to give Reigns a title match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship that night, but with the stipulation that Reigns must beat him in 5:15 (the amount of time that Reigns' short-lived title reign lasted) in order to win the title. Reigns defeated Sheamus by disqualification after Rusev interfered, which prevented Reigns from winning the title. After the match, Sheamus was helped by Rusev, King Barrett, and Alberto Del Rio, and introduced themselves as The League of Nations.\nOn the November 26 episode of \"SmackDown\", Dean Ambrose won a triple threat match against Dolph Ziggler and Tyler Breeze to become the number one contender to Kevin Owens' Intercontinental Championship.\nOn the November 23 episode of \"Raw\", to celebrate one year as a tag team, The New Day (Kofi Kingston, Big E, and Xavier Woods) decided to issue an open challenge to anyone who wants to have a shot at winning their WWE Tag Team Championship, but when The Lucha Dragons (Kalisto and Sin Cara) and The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) got involved, they decided to cancel the challenge. On the November 30 episode of \"Raw\", the match to determine the #1 contender between The Usos and The Lucha Dragons ended in a double disqualification after The New Day interfered. The Authority decided to make the WWE Tag Team Championship match a Triple Threat Tag Team Ladder match in which The Lucha Dragons were immediately inserted, but that The Usos would only participate if Roman Reigns defeated Sheamus that night. As Reigns won by disqualification, The Usos were inserted into the title match.\nOn the November 23 episode of \"Raw\", The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper) (with Erick Rowan and Braun Strowman) defeated The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) before repeatedly attacking them. On the November 26 episode of \"SmackDown\", The Dudley Boyz defeated Strowman and Rowan by disqualification after Wyatt Family member Harper interfered in the match. Afterwards, The Wyatt Family put Bubba Ray through a table. On the November 30 episode of \"Raw\", The Dudley Boyz introduced Tommy Dreamer, making his return to WWE in over 5 years, to join them in their ongoing fight against The Wyatt Family. After Rhyno made his return, an eight-man elimination tables match pitting The Dudley Boyz, Dreamer, and Rhyno against The Wyatt Family was scheduled for TLC.\nAfter failing to defeat Charlotte for the WWE Divas Championship at the event, Paige accused her of cheating similar to that of her father Ric Flair on the November 23 episode of \"Raw\". The two faced each other that night in a rematch for the WWE Divas Championship which ended in a double count-out after Paige failed to get back in the ring in time after preventing Charlotte from getting back in first. After the match, Paige continued to attack Charlotte which ended with Paige trapping Charlotte in the \"PTO\" on top of the broadcast table. On the November 30 episode of \"Raw\", Charlotte defeated her friend Becky Lynch after she faked a leg injury and her father distracted Lynch to allow her to roll Lynch for the win. Their friendship was further strained on the December 3 episode of \"SmackDown\", when Charlotte attacked Lynch's opponent Brie Bella while locked in the \"Dis-arm-her\" after Bella hit her by accident, giving Bella a disqualification win. Afterwards, another title match between Paige and Charlotte was scheduled for TLC.\nThe 2015 Survivor Series was the last Survivor Series held before the reintroduction of the brand extension in July 2016, which again split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. Additionally, the 2016 event was the genesis of the 2016-2021 events, in which Survivor Series became themed around brand supremacy, featuring the brands competing against each other. However, the 2022 event carried the WarGames concept instead of the brand supremacy theme, and was known as .\nResults.\nWWE World Heavyweight Championship tournament.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "title": "2016 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 2016 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game that was played on January 1, 2016 at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California. This 102nd Rose Bowl Game matched the Big Ten Conference West Division champion Iowa Hawkeyes against the Pac-12 Conference champion Stanford Cardinal. It was one of the 2015–16 bowl games that concluded the 2015 FBS football season. Sponsored by the Northwestern Mutual financial services organization, the game is officially known as the Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual. Stanford defeated Iowa 45–16 to win the championship and the Lathrop K. Leishman trophy.\nThe contest was televised on ESPN with a radio broadcast on ESPN Radio and XM Satellite Radio, which began at 1:30 PM (PST) with kickoff at 2:10 PM (PST). The Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association was the organizer of the game.\nThe Rose Bowl Game was a contractual sell-out, with 64,500 tickets allocated to the participating teams and conferences. The remaining tickets are distributed to the Tournament of Roses members, sponsors, City of Pasadena residents, and the general public. Ticket prices were $150 and $185.\nPre-game activities.\nThe game was presided over by the 2016 Rose Queen, the Royal Court, Tournament of Roses President Mike Matthiessen, and Ken Burns, the Grand Marshal. The theme of the parade and game was \"Find Your Adventure\".\nAfter the teams' arrival in Southern California, the teams participated in the traditional Lawry's Beef Bowl in Beverly Hills and the Disney Media Day at the Disneyland Resort in nearby Anaheim. The Rose Bowl Hall of Fame ceremony luncheon was held prior to the game at the Pasadena Convention Center, where outstanding former players and participants were inducted into the hall. They were Mark Brunell, Washington; Jim Muldoon, Pac-10 Conference; Fritz Pollard, Brown; and Tyrone Wheatley, Michigan.\nThe bands and cheerleaders from both schools participated in the pre-game Rose Parade on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California along with the floats.\nTeams.\nThe teams playing in the Rose Bowl game were the highest ranking teams from the Pac-12 Conference and Big Ten Conference that were not selected to play in a College Football Playoff semifinal game. The teams were officially selected by the football committee of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association on Selection Sunday on December 6, 2015, based on the final rankings by the CFP committee. The Stanford Cardinal and the Iowa Hawkeyes met for the first time in this game.\nIowa.\nThe Iowa Hawkeyes, as the Big Ten West Division Champions, were back in the Rose Bowl after 25 years, last appearing in the 1991 Rose Bowl. Their last win in Pasadena was against the California Bears, 38–12 in the 1959 Rose Bowl. Prior to the 2016 Rose Bowl, they were 2–3 in Rose Bowl games. In the 2015 season, the team was nearly undefeated before the Rose Bowl, losing only the Big Ten Championship Game to Michigan State 13–16. Iowa wore its black jerseys and used the west bench on game day.\nStanford.\nThe Stanford Cardinal, 11-2 (8-1 in conference), were playing their fifteenth Rose Bowl game (and their third Rose Bowl Game in four years) by winning the Pac-12 Championship Game over USC 41–22. Prior to the 2016 Rose Bowl, they were 6–7–1 in Rose Bowl games, last winning over Wisconsin 20–14 in 2013. They lost the 2014 Rose Bowl to Michigan State 20–24. Stanford wore its white jerseys and used the east bench on game day.\nGame summary.\nSports analysts had anticipated the contest to be exciting, due mainly to the matchup between Iowa's strong run defense and Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey, the Heisman Trophy runner-up. McCaffrey led the FBS in the 2015 season with 3,864 all-purpose yards, which came from punt/kick returns, runs from scrimmage, and passes out of the backfield. In contrast, Iowa's run defense finished the season ranked 14th, allowing only 121 yards per game and having defeated historically rushing teams like Wisconsin, Indiana, and Nebraska.\nMcCaffrey caught a short pass and turned it into a 75-yard touchdown on the first play from scrimmage. The Hawkeyes were unable to stop him, as he averaged 9.6 YPC (172 yards on 18 carries), returned a punt for a touchdown, and converted many third downs. Though he did not rush for any touchdowns from scrimmage, he proved to be the primary playmaker for Stanford, catching a third of Kevin Hogan's twelve passes. McCaffrey was such an offensive threat that Hogan was able to make large gains with the read option, including a wide-open first-quarter option TD run.\nIowa was unable to get their run game going, rushing as a team for 1.3 YPC (48 yards on 38 carries). The longest Iowa runs came from LeShun Daniels, Jr. and Akrum Wadley (14 and 12 yards, respectively), as well as a 14-yard scramble by Quarterback C.J. Beathard. Iowa's inability to establish a run game closed up Iowa's potential for play-action passing, which had been Beathard's bread and butter all season. Jordan Canzeri, Iowa's power halfback, was unable to churn significant yardage, and 3rd-team halfback Akrum Wadley (who had a 200-yard game at Northwestern, when Daniels and Canzeri were both injured) split ballcarrying duties with Daniels in the second half. Iowa's halfbacks, their biggest threat all season, were overall unable to garner any significant yardage on the ground; Derek Mitchell, Jr., Iowa's 4th-team halfback, saw significant action lining up in the backfield and caught 4 passes for 41 yards, and Wadley also contributed to the pass game by catching 3 for 60.\nStanford shut Iowa out in the first half 35–0, with Stanford's 35 points the most scored in the first half of a Rose Bowl in its entire 102-year history. Stanford's 21-0 first-quarter lead was also the most first-quarter points scored by one team in Rose Bowl history. McCaffrey gained a total of 368 all-purpose yards, setting another Rose Bowl record.\nBy the second half, Stanford's explosive offense slowed down, scoring just 10 second-half points versus their 35 first-half points. Iowa did not score until the 3rd quarter when placekicker Marshall Koehn kicked a field goal after converting on 4th down earlier in the drive; Beathard threw two touchdowns in the 4th quarter, with Koehn missing one of the two PATs.\nIowa had a slight advantage in time of possession, possessing the ball for almost 33 minutes, though they were simply unable to make meaning out of their possessions. Iowa also outgained Stanford through the air by a slim margin, with 239 yards to Stanford's 223.\nScoring summary.\nSource:"

        "title": "2015 Maria Sharapova tennis season",
        "text": "The 2015 Maria Sharapova tennis season officially began on 4 January 2015 with the start of the 2015 WTA Tour. Sharapova entered the season ranked as world number 2 behind Serena Williams following the completion of the 2014 season.\nYear in detail.\nEarly hard court season and Australian Open.\nBrisbane International.\nFor the second consecutive year, Sharapova began her season at the Brisbane International, a Premier level tournament on the WTA Tour. As the top seed, Sharapova was given a bye in the first round. Her first match of the 2015 season came against qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova, with Sharapova winning the first nine games on her way to an easy victory. Sharapova's quarterfinal match pitted her against number one Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro, with the Russian winning comfortably in straight sets. She then repeated her quarterfinal scoreline in her semifinal match, beating Elina Svitolina to advance to her first final of 2015. In the final, Sharapova faced world number 7 and second seed Ana Ivanovic. Sharapova took an early break, but failed to convert two set points and eventually lost the tie-break to Ivanovic. She then rebounded to claim the second and third sets to claim her 34th WTA Tour title, and first in Brisbane.\nAustralian Open.\nSharapova's next tournament was the first major of the year, the Australian Open. She was seeded second in the draw, defending fourth round points after losing in 2014 to Dominika Cibulková. In the first round, Sharapova drew Croatian qualifier Petra Martić and won in straight sets. In the second round, Sharapova beat qualifier and fellow countrywoman Alexandra Panova in three sets, despite being down two breaks and saving two match points in the final set. Following her close call with elimination, Sharapova rebounded to win her next two matches in straight sets over Zarina Diyas and Peng Shuai. In the quarterfinals, Sharapova continued her strong form by seeing off world No. 7 Eugenie Bouchard in two sets. Playing in her third Australian Open semifinal in four years, Sharapova made short work of her compatriot and 10th seed Ekaterina Makarova, setting up a final with world number one Serena Williams. The final was a tight contest between the top 2 players in the world, but Sharapova failed to recover from being broken in the opening game, and lost the first set. Sharapova stepped up her play in the second set, and saved two match points to force a tie-break, but in the end, Williams closed the match with an ace, sealing a two set victory. The defeat was Sharapova's third in a Grand Slam final to Williams, and the first of her 2015 season.\nFed Cup World Group – Quarterfinals.\nOne week following her disappointment in the Australian Open final, Sharapova returned to play at the Fed Cup, being selected as part of the Russia team in their quarterfinal tie with Poland in Kraków. It was the first time Sharapova had participated in a Fed Cup tie since Russia's 2012 victory over Spain. Following Svetlana Kuznetsova's first rubber victory, Sharapova played the second rubber against Urszula Radwańska and made short work of her opponent, winning in straight sets to give Russia a 2–0 advantage. The following day, Sharapova returned to play the third rubber against Urszula's sister Agnieszka Radwańska, and defeated the world #8 in straight sets, sealing victory for the Russian team.\nMexican Open.\nSharapova's next activity came at the tournament in Acapulco. It was the first time she had competed in an International tournament since losing to Gréta Arn at the Auckland event in early 2011. Sharapova entered the draw as top seed, and faced American Shelby Rogers in the first round, winning in straight sets. Next, she faced lucky loser Mariana Duque Mariño and won in 68 minutes. In the quarterfinals, Sharapova faced Magdaléna Rybáriková for the first time. She won in three sets, despite struggling with a stomach virus. Sharapova was expected to face Caroline Garcia in the semifinals, but withdrew on the morning of the match due to the virus, giving Garcia a walkover into the final.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nSharapova returned to action in March, competing in Indian Wells. She was seeded second, only defending third rounds after a surprise loss to Camila Giorgi in 2014. After receiving a bye in the first round, Sharapova faced Yanina Wickmayer and won in straight sets. In the third round, she faced former world #1 Victoria Azarenka for the first time since the 2013 French Open. After two close sets and five missed match points, Sharapova prevailed, tying her career record against Azarenka to seven wins each. She failed to progress deeper into the tournament when she lost to defending champion Flavia Pennetta in the fourth round in three sets.\nMiami Open.\nSharapova's next tournament was in Miami. She was seeded second, defending semifinalist points after losing to eventual champion Serena Williams in 2014. After receiving a bye in the first round, Sharapova faced Daria Gavrilova and lost in straight sets. This marked the first time that Sharapova did not make it to the third round since her first appearance at the tournament back in 2003.\nEuropean clay court season and French Open.\nStuttgart Open.\nAs she had done in the previous three years, Sharapova began her clay-court season at Stuttgart, an event she had won on all three occasions that she had entered. She was seeded first, and received a first round bye. In the second round, she drew Angelique Kerber, and despite winning the first set, fell to her third consecutive defeat. The loss also snapped a 64 match win streak on clay where Sharapova won the first set and went on to win the match. The last time Sharapova lost a match on clay after winning the first set was against Dinara Safina in the fourth round at the 2008 French Open. Following the defeat, Sharapova dropped to third in the WTA rankings behind Simona Halep.\nMadrid Open.\nHaving lost her last three matches, Sharapova next entered the 2015 Mutua Madrid Open, where she was the defending champion. Seeded third, she faced a potentially tricky first round tie against Timea Bacsinszky, but won comfortably in straight sets, snapping her losing streak and avenging a defeat to Bacsinszky in Wuhan in late 2014. Sharapova followed up her first round win by claiming victory over Mariana Duque Mariño for the second time in 2015, and then reached the quarterfinals by defeating Caroline Garcia in a tough three set match. In the quarterfinals, Sharapova faced world No. 5 Caroline Wozniacki having lost both of her meetings with the Dane in 2014, but this time emerged victorious in three-sets to set up a semifinal showdown with Svetlana Kuznetsova. In the semifinal Sharapova's return to form came to an abrupt end, losing to Kuznetsova in straight sets. It was her first defeat to Kuznetsova in over seven years.\nItalian Open.\nImmediately following her defeat in Madrid, Sharapova travelled to Italy to compete in the WTA Premier Five tournament in Rome. She was seeded third, defending third round points following an early defeat to Ana Ivanovic in 2014. After a first round bye, Sharapova was leading her second round match when her opponent Jarmila Gajdošová retired with a shoulder injury. She then proceeded to the quarterfinals with a straight sets win over Bojana Jovanovski, setting up a meeting with former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka. Sharapova prevailed in two sets, earning her second win of the season over Azarenka, and taking the lead 8–7 in their overall head-to-head record. In the semifinals, Sharapova faced a rematch with Daria Gavrilova, having suffered a surprise defeat to her earlier in the year in Miami. This time however, Sharapova took revenge on the Russian qualifier, winning a close two-set match to advance to her third Rome final in five years. There, she faced Carla Suárez Navarro for the title, and despite dropping the first set, rebounded to claim the title, winning the last six games. The title was her eleventh on clay courts (tying her with Serena Williams for the most clay court titles of active players.) In addition, by virtue of reaching the final, coupled with Simona Halep's defeat in the semifinals, Sharapova returned to #2 in the WTA rankings, ensuring her position as the second seed at the French Open.\nFrench Open.\nSharapova concluded her clay-court season at the French Open, returning as the defending champion following her victory over Simona Halep in the 2014 final. Seeded second, she faced a potentially tricky first round tie against Kaia Kanepi, but in spite of suffering from an illness, emerged with a straight sets victory. She followed up by defeating compatriot Vitalia Diatchenko in the second round, again in straight sets, setting up a third round clash with Samantha Stosur – a rematch following their three-set fourth round clash in 2014. Sharapova prevailed in straight sets. In the fourth round, Sharapova met 13th seed Lucie Šafářová and was upset in straight sets. The defeat saw the end of her title defence, and was her earliest loss in the French Open since a third round exit against Justine Henin in 2010.\nGrasscourt Season.\nWimbledon.\nAfter opting not to play in any warm-up events, Sharapova made her only appearance of the grasscourt season at Wimbledon, where she was seeded fourth. She began her campaign in straightforward fashion, defeating local Wildcard Johanna Konta and qualifier Richèl Hogenkamp in the first and second rounds respectively. Sharapova's run continued with victory over Irina-Camelia Begu in the third round, defending her points earned in the 2014 tournament. Following the traditional Sunday rest day, Sharapova returned by defeating Zarina Diyas in straight sets in the fourth round, and advanced to the semifinals with a three set victory over American CoCo Vandeweghe in the quarterfinals. In her first Wimbledon semifinal since 2011, Sharapova faced top seed Serena Williams, but lost in straight sets. It was her 17th consecutive loss to the American, and second of the year at Grand Slam level.\nSummer US Open series.\nSharapova was scheduled to play three events during the Summer US Open series – the Rogers Cup in Toronto, the Western &amp; Southern Open in Cincinnati and the US Open. However, she announced her withdrawal from both warm-up events with a right leg injury. Sharapova was drawn to face Daria Gavrilova for the third time in 2015 at the US Open, however she announced her withdrawal from the event one night before the tournament began. Her place in the main draw was given to lucky loser Daria Kasatkina.\nFall Asian hardcourt season.\nWuhan Open.\nHaving not competed since her Wimbledon semifinal defeat, Sharapova made her return to the tour in late September, accepting a wildcard into the main draw at the Wuhan Open. Seeded second, Sharapova received a bye into the second round where she met Barbora Strýcová. However, while leading 2–1 in the final set, Sharapova retired from the match, citing a left forearm injury.\nChina Open.\nFollowing her retirement in Wuhan, Sharapova announced her withdrawal from the following weeks China Open. She had been the defending champion at the event, but opted to withdraw to improve her chances of competing in the 2015 WTA Finals in Singapore and the Fed Cup Final in Prague.\nWTA Finals.\nDespite her lack of activity, Sharapova officially qualified for the 2015 WTA Finals in Singapore on September 10. She was seeded third behind Simona Halep and Garbiñe Muguruza, and was placed in the red group alongside Halep, Agnieszka Radwańska and US Open champion, Flavia Pennetta. Despite playing down her chances before the tournament began, Sharapova began the group stage with a three set win over Radwańska to earn her first tour win since July. She then continued her head-to-head dominance over Halep with a straight sets victory, leaving qualification for the semifinals in her own hands going into the final match of the group stage. Following Radwańska's victory over Halep, Sharapova entered final group match against Pennetta assured of qualification regardless of the result, but nevertheless she recorded a straight sets victory, completing the group stage with a 3–0 record and pushing Pennetta into retirement. Sharapova had lost their last three encounters; it was her first win over the Italian since 2006 as well as their first match up decided in straight sets. The victory tied Sharapova's career record against Pennetta to 3–3. Prior to this, Pennetta had been the only player present at the event to hold a winning record over Sharapova. In the semifinal, Sharapova looked to avenge a 2014 group stage defeat to Petra Kvitová at the same venue, but lost in straight sets, despite taking a big lead in the second set. Following her semifinal defeat, Sharapova finished the year ranked #4, a drop of two places from 2014.\nFed Cup Final.\nSharapova concluded her season by leading Russia in the Fed Cup final against the Czech Republic away in Prague. Though she had participated in the Russian team's 2008 title winning run, Sharapova had missed the final through injury, thus making this her first appearance in a Fed Cup final. Following her teammate Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova's three set defeat to Petra Kvitová, Sharapova competed in the second rubber against world #11 Karolína Plíšková. In her first career meeting with her opponent, Sharapova claimed a straight set victories, levelling the tie at 1–1 at the end of the first day. Sharapova returned for the third rubber the following morning, looking to avenge her recent Year End Championships defeat to Kvitová. This time, Sharapova prevailed, coming back from a set down to clinch a three set victory. The win gave Russia a 2–1 lead in the tie, and signalled the end of Sharapova's 2015 season. Unfortunately for the Russian team, Sharapova's victories would be the only ones for the team, with Pavlyuchenkova losing in singles to Plíšková, then losing to Plíšková and Barbora Strýcová in the decisive doubles tie with Elena Vesnina\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nSharapova's 2015 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\n\"Ordered by number of wins"

        "text": "The Lancashire Cup was an English Rugby Football Union competition founded in 1971. It was organized by the Lancashire Rugby Football Union and was open to all eligible clubs in the Lancashire region including a number of clubs in Cheshire and Merseyside. The men's competition was discontinued at the end of 2013 as there were not enough teams willing to participate in the cup (partly due to the increased demands of league rugby).\nHistory.\nDespite the Lancashire RFU being established in 1881 and having the most successful county team in the country, club rugby union took a long time to catch on in Lancashire. While bitter rivals Yorkshire had an established county club competition (the Yorkshire Cup) which had been running since 1878, Lancashire did not have a similar competition until 1971. This lack of competitive rugby meant that Lancashire had a smaller membership of clubs when compared to its counterpart. Some of the current clubs competing seem to be based outside of Lancashire, such as Liverpool St Helens and Waterloo, but when the Lancashire RFU was founded, places like Merseyside and Liverpool were part of the county, and these teams have retained their membership."

The name returned when the Colorado Springs Millionaires moved to town and became the Indians in 1905, and they remained active until 1909. In 1911 the Wichita Jobbers moved to Pueblo and finished out the season as the Indians. This team moved to the Rocky Mountain League in 1912 but quickly moved to Trinidad during the season."

The Cavaliers played their home games at Davenport Field as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. They were led by head coach Brian O'Connor, in his 12th season at Virginia.\n2015 was a tough regular season for the 2014 NCAA runner-up. The Cavaliers slogged through a disappointing and injury-filled regular season. By winning 5 of its last 6 ACC games, the Cavs managed to cobble together a .500 ACC record, qualifying them for a play in game at the ACC tournament. At the tournament they won the play in game against Georgia Tech and then promptly lost the last three games.\nVirginia was given an NCAA tournament berth, as a No. 3 regional seed, and the Cavs took full advantage. They swept through the Lake Elsinore (Calif.) Regional, and because Maryland, also a #3 seed, had won its regional, were able to host a Super Regional, which the Cavaliers swept as well.\nIn Omaha the Cavaliers won the 2015 College World Series, highlighted by winning two of three games against Florida before ousting Vanderbilt in three games in the CWS Finals. Virginia's season was notable for the Cavaliers continuing to battle in spite of numerous setbacks. That never give up attitude was evident in its post season as well: UVA scored the go-ahead run in the fifth inning or later in each of their 10 postseason wins.\nPrevious season.\nIn 2014, the Cavaliers finished the season 2nd in the ACC's Coastal Division with a record of 47–14, 22–8 in conference play. They qualified for the 2014 Atlantic Coast Conference baseball tournament and were eliminated in pool play. They qualified for the 2014 NCAA Division I baseball tournament as the #3 overall national seed, and were placed in the Charlottesville Regional, of which they were hosts. Also, in the regional were Bucknell, Liberty, and Arkansas. The Cavaliers defeated Bucknell, 10–1, in the opening game, and then shut out Arkansas, 3–0, to advance to the regional final. There, they again defeated Arkansas, this time by a score of 9–2. In the Super Regional, the Cavaliers fell in the opening game to ACC foe Maryland, 4–5. However, they rebounded and defeated the Terrapins in the next two games, 7–3 and 11–2, to advance to the College World Series.\nIn the College World Series, Virginia's first game was against Ole Miss, whom the Cavaliers defeated, 2–1. In the second round, Virginia defeated #7 national seed TCU, 3–2, in 15 innings. In the semifinals, the Cavaliers again defeated Ole Miss, this time by a score of 4–1. The Cavaliers advanced to the College World Series finals to play Vanderbilt. In the first game of the finals, the Commodores won by a score of 9–8. Virginia then rebounded to defeat Vanderbilt, 7–2, in game two. In a winner-take-all game three, Vanderbilt prevailed, 3–2, to be crowned national champions.\nSchedule.\n! style=\"background:#00214E;color:white;\"| Regular season\n! style=\"background:#00214E;color:white;\"| Post-season"

The 2015 Cricket World Cup Final took place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and was won by Australia, who defeated New Zealand by 7 wickets in the final.\nThe fourteen teams that competed at the 2015 World Cup were all required to submit a final 15-man squad to the ICC headquarters in Dubai on or before 7 January 2015, although the squads did not have to be publicly that date. In order to assist this process, many teams chose to name larger probable squads in November or December, with the understanding that the final squad would be picked from within these players. Changes to the squad were allowed after this deadline at the discretion of the ICC's Technical Committee in necessary cases, such as due to player injury, and so some teams also chose to name standby players alongside their 15-man squad.\nSri Lanka chose to name veteran players Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara in their squad- they were the two most experienced ODI players at the tournament, as Jayawardene has played over 400 ODIs for Sri Lanka, and Sangakkara played his 400th ODI during the tournament. Jayawardene was also the most experienced World Cup player at the tournament, with 33 previous appearances. UAE's Khurram Khan was the oldest player at the tournament, whilst fellow Emirati Mohammad Tauqir became the oldest ever World Cup captain; both players were 43 years old. Afghanistan's Usman Ghani was the youngest player at the tournament, at the age of 18.\nBelow is a list of the squads chosen for the 2015 Cricket World Cup.\nGroup A.\nAfghanistan.\nAfghanistan named their 15-man squad on 29 December 2014.

Michael Clarke's selection was provisional on his fitness, but on 18 February, Clarke was declared fit to play against Bangladesh. As this match was abandoned without a ball being bowled, Clarke's first game of the World Cup was against co-hosts New Zealand on 28 February. George Bailey captained the side in their opening game against England, but was then dropped from the team when Clarke returned.\nCoach: Darren Lehmann\nBangladesh.\nBangladesh announced their 15-member squad on 4 January 2015. The squad was initially scheduled to be announced at 1300 local time (). However, it was delayed by two hours as a result of a last minute discussion between the selection committee, the board of directors of the BCB, and BCB President Nazmul Hassan. Two standby players were also announced, with Shafiul Islam, Abul Hasan named. After receiving a 40% match fee fine and a warning for slow over rate, captain Mashrafe Mortaza sat out of the last Group Stage match against New Zealand, to avoid being suspended for their quarter-final with India; Shakib Al Hasan captained the team for this match.\nCoach: Chandika Hathurusingha\n1 On 23 February, Al-Amin Hossain was sent home from the tournament after breaking a team curfew.

The initial focus was on silk-screening and advertising support work for automotive companies.\nIn 1938 Fred Bear hired Nels Grumley, a woodworker and bowyer, and the company expanded to offer hand-made bows.\nFred Bear sold the advertising side of the Bear Products Company in 1940. The archery business was named Bear Archery.\nIn 1947 the company moved to a new facility in Grayling, Michigan. The Grayling plant focused on making and marketing recurve bows and longbows in a growing archery market. Bow manufacturing changed from hand-made bows to mass production using fiberglass and other modern materials.\nFred Bear sold the company to Victor Comptometer in 1968, but remained the president of Bear Archery. The company was not one of the first compound bow manufacturers, but eventually found success with early models like the Whitetail Hunter.\nBear Archery moved manufacturing from Michigan to Gainesville, Florida in 1978.\nOver the next three decades Bear Archery changed hands in a series of mergers, acquisitions, and spin-offs from Victor Comptometer to Walter Kidde &amp; Co, Hanson PLC, U.S. Industries, Fenway Partners and the North American Archery Group.\nIn 2003 Escalade Sports acquired the North American Archery Group and currently does business as Bear Archery Inc."

        "text": "The 2016 Pro Bowl (branded as the 2016 Pro Bowl presented by USAA for sponsorship reasons) was the National Football League's all-star game for the 2015 season, which was played at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii on January 31, 2016. As of 2023, this was the last time the Pro Bowl was held in Hawaii.\nAndy Reid of the Kansas City Chiefs and Mike McCarthy of the Green Bay Packers were selected to coach the teams due to their teams being the highest seeded teams from each conference to lose in the Divisional Round of 2015–16 NFL playoffs, which has been the convention since the 2010 Pro Bowl. On January 27, Mike McCarthy announced that he would not be coaching the Pro Bowl due to an illness and also announced that assistant head coach Winston Moss would take over head coaching duties. This was also the sixth consecutive year that the Pro Bowl took place prior to the Super Bowl. At the Pro Bowl Draft, the Chiefs' coaching staff was assigned to Team Rice, and the Packers' coaching staff was assigned to Team Irvin.\nThe game continued the fantasy draft format that debuted with the 2014 Pro Bowl. The two teams were to be drafted and captained by two Hall of Famers, Jerry Rice (winning 2014 Pro Bowl captain) and Michael Irvin (winning 2015 Pro Bowl captain). Darren Woodson and Eric Davis served as defensive co-captains for Irvin and Rice respectively, in both cases reuniting two former teammates (Irvin and Woodson were teammates on the Dallas Cowboys from 1992 to 1999, while Rice and Davis played together with the San Francisco 49ers from 1990 to 1995). The Fantasy draft was held January 27 at 7:30 P.M. EST on ESPN2 at Wheeler Army Airfield in Wahiawa, Hawaii as part of an extension to the NFL's military appreciation campaign.\nGame format.\nThe game format was nearly the same for 2016 as it had been in 2015. The previous year's experimental rule of kicking the point after touchdown from the 15-yard line became a permanent rule. The goal posts remained at their normal 18-foot width in 2016, as compared to the narrower 14-foot width from the 2015 Pro Bowl.\nRosters.\nSelected but did not participate.\nNotes:\nPlayers must have accepted their invitations as alternates to be listed; those who declined, such as Philip Rivers, are not considered Pro Bowlers.\nBroadcasting.\nThe game was televised nationally by ESPN, which has the exclusive broadcast rights to the Pro Bowl through to 2022.\nWestwood One radio broadcast the game nationally, with Kevin Kugler on play-by-play, Tony Boselli on color commentary, and Laura Okmin on the sidelines."

        "text": "The 1971–72 Yugoslav First Basketball League season was the 28th season of the Yugoslav First Basketball League, the top-tier professional basketball league in SFR Yugoslavia.\nNotable events.\nEarly pacesetters: Zvezda, Jugoplastika, and Lokomotiva.\nThe season began on 6 November 1971 with Crvena zvezda, defending champion Jugoplastika, Lokomotiva, and Olimpija tipped as main title contenders by the observers.\nOlimpija fell out of the title contention almost immediately, recording several losses in their first few games of the season while Crvena zvezda and Lokomotiva jumped to the top of the standings early on. Jugoplastika also kept pace with the standings leaders while Borac Čačak, finding success behind Radmilo Mišović's scoring exploits, and Radnički Belgrade became the early season's surprise packages.\nIn week 4 of the season, Crvena zvezda and Jugoplastika played a hard-fought game in Belgrade's Hala sportova with Zvezda coming out on top 98–86. In addition to highly competitive basketball and Zoran Slavnić's exceptional performance, the game is also remembered for the bench-clearing brawl that occurred with four minutes to go in the contest after Jugoplastika's point guard Rato Tvrdić punched Zvezda's shooting guard Duci Simonović.\nZadar vs Zvezda on Catholic Christmas 1971.\nOn Saturday, 25 December 1971, as part of the season's week 8, KK Zadar and Crvena zvezda faced off at KK Zadar's Jazine home court—a tense and incident-filled contest remembered for the extremely hostile atmosphere with nationalist and sectarian overtones directed towards the visiting team by the home fans. Scheduled to be played on Catholic Christmas—a holiday not officially celebrated in communist SFR Yugoslavia—the game featured tensions even before tip off as the visiting Crvena zvezda players and personnel had to be escorted by police from the moment of their arrival in Zadar.\nAs the teams entered the Jazine court before the game, the hosts decided to power off the arena lights while the only light in the hall was provided from the thousands of candles distributed out to the gathered spectators. Following the tip off, Zadar fans began throwing the said candles onto the court, continuing to do so throughout the game while the referees — brothers Janko and Petar Kavčić from Ljubljana — didn't stop the contest out of fear of enraging the crowd even more. Among the verbal abuse hurled at Zvezda players were hate speech chants \"Srbe na vrbe\". With five minutes to go in the close game, Zadar's best player and leading scorer Josip Gjergja twisted his ankle after stepping on one of the candles littering the court and had to leave the contest. Zvezda ended up winning 60–61.\nAs soon as the game ended, Zvezda players were surrounded by police mid-court as the angry Zadar fans tried to physically accost the visiting team. Shortly, even the army had to be called in as re-enforcement in order to escort the visiting team out of the arena. In the chaos and confusion while the Zvezda players were surrounded by army recruits out on the court, a young female Zadar fan got in-between two of the soldiers guarding Zvezda players and stabbed Zvezda's shooting guard Ivan Sarjanović in the upper thigh with a compass.\nLeague table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSingle-game title playoff.\nDue to Crvena Zvezda and Jugoplastika being tied for the top spot with identical 17–5 records at the end of the season, the champion was decided in a one-game playoff between the two teams since, as stipulated by the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia regulations, points difference wasn't legitimate criteria to determine a league champion in case of a tie at the top. The regulations further stated that the deciding game's venue had to be neutral and mutually agreed upon between the two teams. Crvena Zvezda requested Sarajevo while Jugoplastika wanted Ljubljana. Due to the teams' inability to agree, the venue was decided by coin toss that was won by Jugoplastika.\nAccordingly, the game ended up being played in Ljubljana's Tivoli Hall on Thursday, 27 April 1972. In a close game (Jugoplastika was up by four 35–39 at halftime), Zvezda's playmaker Zoran Slavnić hit a shot within final thirty seconds for a 67–67 tie at the end of regulation. Zvezda ended up winning 75–70 largely behind Zoran Lazarević's 12 points, all of which he scored towards the end of regulation and in overtime.\nWinning Roster.\nThe winning roster of Crvena Zvezda:\nCoach: Bratislav Đorđević\nQualification in 1972-73 season European competitions.\nFIBA European Champions Cup\nFIBA Cup Winner's Cup\nFIBA Korać Cup"

The change enabled the league to switch to a seasonal schedule that begins during autumn and ends in spring as opposed to the previous practice of playing within the same calendar year, usually between April and October.\nNotable events.\nYugoslav basketball moves indoors.\nSince most Yugoslav basketball clubs didn't yet possess basketball-specific indoor facilities of their own, they had to make do with hosting their home games in community-owned makeshift venues or in case of three clubs–playing outside of their home city.\nThe four Belgrade clubs–Red Star, Partizan, OKK, and Radnički–played their home games at the various Belgrade Fair halls (including the biggest one: Hall 1), Zagreb's Lokomotiva played at the Zagreb Police's Fire Hall, while certain clubs had to play in altogether different cities: defending champions KK Zadar played most of their home games of the season in Split, Čačak's Borac played their home games in Zrenjanin, and Sarajevo's newly-promoted Mlada Bosna played in Zenica.\nOpening day.\nThe season began on Saturday, 11 November 1967–only six days after the previous season ended on 5 November 1967–with the opening game in Ljubljana's Topniška Street Hall pitting the home team KD Slovan versus the visiting Red Star Belgrade.

It would later come out that his injury likely occurred jumping out of a hotel window while leaving, without permission, the pre-finals team quarantine to meet with his girlfriend. As a result of missing their best player, Partizan struggled mightily in game one away in Split, getting blown out by 22 points, 101–79, with Jugoplastika's young center Dino Rađa scoring 23 points, Željko Poljak adding 16, and young Toni Kukoč scoring 15. On the other hand, hapless Partizan's best contribution was from their young point guard Saša Đorđević who scored 22 points.\nGame 2: Partizan vs. Jugoplastika 86–80.\nSeeing that without Divac's inside presence they stand no chance versus Jugoplastika, Partizan hustled their injured young center back on the court. Playing on one leg with a heavily bandaged knee, Divac still led the game two scoring with 18 points as Partizan pulled out an 86–80 victory at home. It was only Jugoplastika's second loss of the entire season.\nGame 3: Jugoplastika vs. Partizan 88–67.\nStill-injured Divac appeared in the deciding game three back in Split but was no match for the rampant home team looking for their first league title since 1977. The fact that Partizan played with virtually no inside presence under the basket was heavily exploited by Jugoplastika's center line of Rađa and , as their backup center Sobin posted his season-high 28 points.

With less than two minutes to go and Jugoplastika up by one, Partizan played the ball down in the low post to Vlade Divac who quickly got double-teamed and kicked the ball out to the open teammate on the three-point line, young shooting guard Predrag Danilović. Nineteen-year-old Danilović air-balled the wide open three and Jugoplastika's Toni Kukoč, who grabbed Danilović's air ball, ran a quick counterattack with Partizan's defence out of position, passing off to wide open who scored for 71-74. By the end, Partizan only managed to get closer to 73-74 via Divac drawing a foul then hitting two free throws. After successfully defending Jugoplastika's following possession, Partizan then had the game's last possession with 23 seconds left. The ball once again went to Divac who drove right from the left side of the half court, getting into traffic of defensive Jugoplastika bodies under the basket and missing his half-hook shot. Jugoplastika won away, 73-74, behind Sobin's game-high 21 points, thus taking the home-court advantage from Partizan.\nGame 2: Jugoplastika vs. Partizan 75-70.\nPlayed in front packed Gripe Hall with 8,000 spectators, visitors Partizan were up 43-44 at the half.\nIn the second half, the lead kept changing throughout the period. Entering the last minute of play, with Jugoplastika up by 3, Partizan point guard Saša Đorđević's three-point attempt was blocked by Luka Pavićević who then grabbed the ball and ran it the other way for a layup and 75-70 Jugoplastika lead. In Partizan's following possession, Žarko Paspalj got fouled in the act of shooting with 28 seconds left in the game. During the timeout before Paspalj's free throws, already incensed with some of the prior decisions by the two refs—Zdravko Kurilić (from Tuzla) and Ljupče Ristovski (from Skopje)—Partizan's head coach Duško Vujošević began intensely going at Kurilić verbally and was assessed a technical foul. With Vujošević continually raging at referee Kurilić and Partizan bench pelted with coins and other objects by the Split crowd, Vujošević decided to take his team off the court and not return. The score at the time of Partizan's walk-out, 75-70, was registered as the final score of the game.\nGame 3: Jugoplastika vs. Partizan 2-0.\nThe Yugoslav Basketball Federation's (KSJ) competition commission headed by Radomir Šaper looked into the case of Partizan walking off the court in game two and decided to register game three administratively as a 2-0 Jugoplastika home win.

        "text": "The 1989–90 Yugoslav First Basketball League season was the 46th season of the Yugoslav First Basketball League, the highest professional basketball league in SFR Yugoslavia.\nNotable events.\nStar players going abroad before turning 28.\nThe season saw new developments in the business aspect of basketball in Yugoslavia as a result of the Yugoslav First Basketball League's basketball talent becoming interesting to rich NBA teams. With the country's still-formally-enforced strict sporting exit rules—stipulating that no player is allowed to transfer abroad before turning 28 years of age—already being bent and occasionally loosened (superstar Dražen Petrović going to Real Madrid at the age of 24 one year earlier), summer 1989 saw two more high-profile star players leaving the league way before turning 28: twenty-one-year-old Vlade Divac joining the Los Angeles Lakers and twenty-three-year-old Žarko Paspalj heading to the San Antonio Spurs.\nAttracted by superior financial compensation in the NBA, the summer 1989 offseason saw yet another newly drafted young Yugoslav star player, Dino Rađa, even resort to unilaterally travelling to the United States and signing with the Boston Celtics despite having a valid contract with KK Jugoplastika; he would eventually be forced to return to Yugoslavia following a Jugoplastika-initiated legal process before U.S. courts. With NBA scouts closely following a number of other Yugoslav League young players—such as Jugoplastika's Toni Kukoč and Žan Tabak, KK Partizan's Predrag Danilović, Saša Đorđević, and Miroslav Pecarski, KK Crvena zvezda's Rastko Cvetković, KK Cibona's Franjo Arapović, KK Zadar's Stojko Vranković and Arijan Komazec, KK Olimpija's Radisav Ćurčić, etc. not to mention a slew of even younger juniors coming up such as Dejan Bodiroga and Željko Rebrača—it was becoming clear that the decades-long system of keeping players in the country until the age of 28 was about to become impossible to keep maintaining.\n\"Koš\" magazine.\nFrom October 1989, the country also got its first-ever basketball specific periodical publication. A magazine named \"Koš\" with Vladimir Stanković as its editor-in-chief—devoted entirely to coverage of Yugoslav basketball league, Yugoslav national teams (men's and women's), and Yugoslav players abroad—was launched by the Borba publishing house, thus further indicating the level of popularity the sport had grown to in the country. The first issue of \"Koš\" featured Lakers rookie Vlade Divac on the cover, standing in front of The Forum in Los Angeles while wearing his number 12 Lakers jersey.\nNBA broadcasts begin on Yugoslav television.\nFurthermore, with Petrović moving to the Portland Trail Blazers—along with Divac and Paspalj joining the Lakers and Spurs, respectively—the entire Yugoslav basketball media ecosystem began to change as well. Yugoslav Radio Television (JRT), country's public broadcasting system, bought television rights to an NBA package consisting of 26 NBA games (18 regular season games and 8 playoff games) from the 1989-90 season—mostly involving Lakers, Blazers, and Spurs—for US$28,000. The US$28,000 price tag (US$67,000 in 2022) was reportedly split between JRT's two biggest television affiliates—TV Beograd and TV Zagreb—with each one paying US$14,000. Carried in Yugoslavia starting from 19 November 1989, on tape delay, the NBA broadcasts marked the first time that games from a foreign basketball league games were shown on Yugoslav television.\nPlayoff.\nThe winning roster of Jugoplastika:\nCoach: Božidar Maljković\nPlay-out.\nSix teams competed to qualify for the 1990-91 Yugoslav basketball league (9th-placed IMT and 10th-placed Novi Zagreb from the A league; second-placed Rabotnički and third-placed Radnički from the IB league (East division), second-placed Spartak Subotica and third-placed Čelik Zenica from the IB league (West division).\nQualifying round.\nRabotnički - Čelik 71-68, 72-82, 71-72\nSpartak Subotica - Radnički Belgrade 85-82, 69-106, 72-67\nFinal round.\nIMT - Spartak 94-85, Novi Zagreb- Čelik 72-69,\nSpartak - Novi Zagreb 93-87, Čelik - IMT 57-67,\nNovi Zagreb - IMT 81-69, Spartak- Čelik 55-62,\nSpartak - IMT 68-82, Čelik - Novi Zagreb 78-65,\nIMT - Čelik 91-80, Novi Zagreb - Spartak 85-70,\nIMT - Novi Zagreb 82-80, Čelik - Spartak 98-83.\nQualification in 1990-91 season European competitions.\nFIBA European Champions Cup\nFIBA Cup Winners' Cup\nFIBA Korać Cup"

        "text": "The 1990–91 Yugoslav First Basketball League season was the 47th season of the Yugoslav First Basketball League, the highest professional basketball league in SFR Yugoslavia.\nPlayoff.\nThe winning roster of POP 84:\nCoach: Željko Pavličević\nAll-Star Game.\nThe season saw the first ever Yugoslav Basketball League All-Star Game take place in Sarajevo's Skenderija Hall on Tuesday, 7 May 1991 after the league playoffs ended. The event was not organized by the Yugoslav Basketball Federation (KSJ), but rather as an exhibition showcase put together by the host club KK Bosna and Sarajevo-based \"Večernje novine\" daily newspaper.\nDue to not being sanctioned by the KSJ and FIBA, the organizers decided to time the game in accordance with the NBA rules: four quarters of twelve minutes each rather than the then FIBA customary two halves of twenty minutes each. Divided among the arbitrarily created Red team coached by Duško Vujošević and the White team coached by Željko Pavličević, the 1990-91 Yugoslav League twenty-four best players contested a game that ended 125-114 for the White team.\nThe Reds (Crveni) consisted of: 4. Željko Obradović, 5. Zdravko Radulović, 6. Velimir Perasović, 7. Jure Zdovc, 8. Radisav Ćurčić, 9. Danko Cvjetićanin, 10. Mario Primorac, 11. Samir_Avdić 12. Andro Knego, 13. Zoran Savić, 14. Žarko Paspalj, and Ivica Marić.\nThe Whites (Bijeli) consisted of: 4. Aleksandar Đorđević, 5. Predrag Danilović, 6. Zoran Sretenović, 7. Toni Kukoč, 8. Zoran Čutura, 9. , 10. Zoran Jovanović, 11. Miroslav Pecarski, 12. , 13. Arijan Komazec, Žan Tabak, and 15. Ivo Nakić.\nIn addition to the All-Star game, a three-point shootout competition and a dunk contest were held during the game's halftime.\n3-point shootout.\nTotal of 19 players signed up for the shootout that consisted of 25 shots from five different positions in 60 seconds — five racks of five balls each — with each regular ball made worth one point and the last ball in each rack (moneyball) worth two points. In the preliminary qualification, the best five were chosen for the final that took place during the All-Star Game halftime.\nThe 3-point shootout finalists were:\nThe final's first elimination stage was played in two rounds with each player's best score taken for classification. The two best scores posted were Komazec's and Cvjetićanin's — Komazec had 25 points in his second round while Cvjetićanin had 20 points in his first.\nThe two thus went head-to-head for the title in an additional two rounds. In the first additional round, Cvjetićanin had 19 points while Komazec had 14. In the second additional round, Cvjetićanin posted 23 points while Komazec also had 23.\nKomazec won due to the better first additional round. In addition to the trophy, he received a money prize of YUD30,000.\nDunk contest.\nFour players made the final: \nFive judges for the dunk competition were: Žarko Varajić, Mirza Delibašić, , , and Vinko Jelovac.\nIn the first round, Avdić's dunk earned 41 points, Kukoč's 48, Bacalja's 44, and Pecarski's 43. In the second round, Avdić had 46 points, Kukoč 46, Bacalja 50 (behind the back dunk on the second try), and Pecarski 45. In the third round, Avdić had 46 points, Kukoč 50 (one-handed dunk from the free-throw line), Bacalja 50 (behind the back dunk after a bounce), and Pecarski 46.\nKukoč and Bacalja made the two-man final. In the first round, Kukoč had 47 while Bacalja also had 47. In the second round, Kukoč had 50 (dunked with two balls) while Bacalja had 48. In the third round, Kukoč had 50 (another one-handed dunk from the free-throw line) while Bacalja had 47."

He also earned Most Valuable Player honors in 1977.\nProfessional career.\nCarpio joined the Crispa Redmanizers and learned from the team's resident stars like Atoy Co, Freddie Hubalde, Abet Guidaben and Philip Cezar. He was a reliable off-the-bench player as Crispa constantly battled Toyota for PBA trophies. In 1983, he would join a powerhouse offensive team in Great Taste, which boasted of a very promising center in Manny Victorino, 3-time MVP Bogs Adornado (acquired from the disbanded U/tex team) and sensational Fil-Am rookie Ricardo Brown. Carpio faced his former team in two straight championship series (the Reinforced and the Open), losing both to the Grand Slam-winning Redmanizers. Great Taste, however, exacted sweet revenge against Crispa in the Third Conference of the following year, en route to three straight titles extending all the way to the 1985 season. While playing for the Coffee Makers, he earned the moniker \"The Scavenger\" from commentator Pinggoy Pengson for his penchant for collaring offensive rebounds and following up on missed shots as well as recovering loose balls. After spending the tailend of his career with Seven-Up, he was forced to end his playing days after nagging knee injuries could no longer be repaired. He spent 13 seasons in the PBA.\nLife after Basketball.\nCarpio currently works as a public relations officer in the Commission on Elections."
