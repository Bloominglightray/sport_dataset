        "title": "Ivory Coast national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Ivory Coast national rugby union team, nicknamed \"Les Éléphants\", participates in the annual Africa Cup and are considered a third tier rugby team.\nFormed in 1990, the team's most significant achievement to date was their success in qualifying for the Rugby World Cup for their first and so far only time in 1995. They have not qualified since, though they did reach the semi-finals of the African qualifying competition for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, achieving a home draw against eventual qualifiers Namibia before being defeated in their away match.\nRugby union in Côte d'Ivoire is popular among school children, but the rugby union playing population in Côte d'Ivoire is still relatively small with only 14 clubs and 470 registered senior players.\nThe national side is ranked 43rd in the world (as of 29 July 2019).\nHistory.\nThe Fédération Ivoirienne de Rugby, the national rugby union federation, was formed in March 1990, the same month that it joined the International Rugby Board. They qualified for the World Cup the first time in 1995 and suffered defeats by Scotland, France and Tonga.\nWith a small player base, and starved of strong competition, the team has deteriorated in recent years. Recent defeats to Morocco mean they are ranked below the North African side. Their record in the World Cup has been poor, and they have not managed a win. Their record defeat, 89–0 against Scotland in the 1995 tournament, led to some questioning the presence of the minor teams at the tournament. Ivory Coast, however, played much better in the following match, losing to France by 54–18, with 2 tries scored. The final match with Tonga, lost by 29–11, in the 1995 World Cup saw a major tragedy, as Max Brito suffered a cervical spine injury that left him a quadriplegic.\nAfter the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Ivory Coast took a three years break from international competition, only returning for the 1999 Rugby World Cup qualifyings, in September 1998. Ivory Coast was very unfortunate, losing all the three matches, to Namibia (10–22), Zimbabwe (0–32), and Morocco (3–6), in a tournament held in Casablanca, Morocco.\nAfter another hiatus of two years and a half, the Elephants returned for the Africa Championship, in 2001, losing both matches with Morocco, 11–18 at home and 18–20 away, and achieving an 11–11 draw with Tunisia, abroad, and a 46–0 win at home.\nIvory Coast missed the 2003 Rugby World Cup qualification, after losses to Tunisia (8–13) and Morocco (21–23). In the 2007 Rugby World Cup qualifyings, they started promisingly with two wins with Senegal (20–6) and Zimbabwe (33–3), but had mixed results with Morocco, a 9–9 draw at home and a 7–23 loss abroad, and Uganda, with a 7–32 loss abroad and an 18–9 win at home, and were subsequently eliminated.\nThe Ivorians advanced of the semi-final stage of the 2011 Rugby World Cup qualifiers, after a 21–9 win over Morocco, in Casablanca. They faced Namibia afterwards, reaching a 13–13 draw at Abidjan, but losing by 14–54 in Windhoek, being unable to qualify once again.\nIn the 2015 World Cup qualifying campaign the Ivory Coast were eliminated at the group stage after coming second in a five team group. Each team only played two matches so despite winning both their matches they finished behind Botswana who also won both their matches.\nResults summary.\nAs of 12 July 2021 their record against all nations is as follows:\nCurrent squad.\nSquad for the 2011 World Cup qualifiers against Namibia. Ivory Coast squad for the Africa Cup match Morocco (3-60) is available here."

        "text": "The Italian Baseball League (IBL, ), officially known as the Serie A (), is the top-level baseball league in Italy. Founded in 1948, it is governed by the Italian Baseball &amp; Softball Federation (FIBS), which has its headquarters in Rome.\nMany of the teams are based in the northern Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, which has historically been the hotbed of baseball in the country; a team from the Republic of San Marino also plays in Serie A.\nLike most professional sports leagues in Europe, and unlike professional baseball leagues in North America and Asia, the IBL uses a promotion and relegation system; the bottom five clubs are relegated to the Serie B minor league. Winners of the league are awarded a \"scudetto\", and earn the right to represent Italy in the European Champions Cup.\nHistory.\nUntil 2010, the IBL featured a promotion-and-relegation league format that demoted the last place finisher to the minor leagues (Series A2), while the Serie A2 (baseball) champion would be promoted into the IBL. This was changed in late 2009, when FIBS approved the decision to introduce a fixed-team franchise format (similar to that found in Major League Baseball) starting with the 2010 season. \nHowever, in 2018, the promotion-and-relegation system was reintroduced.\nIn 2021, the Italian Baseball League was rebranded as Serie A, bringing together the previous eight-team Serie A1 and the second-tier Serie A2. The new league was structured into 33 participating teams in 8 divisions, or \"gironi\" ( \"groups\"). The 8 \"gironi\" winners compete for the league championship (the \"scudetto\"), while the remaining 25 will fight to avoid being among the five relegated to Serie B. In 2023, the league size was reduced to 30 teams, divided into five \"gironi\"; the top two in each group of the first phase (\"prima face\") advance to the \"poule scudetto\" (and then to the playoffs), while those not qualified fight to avoid relegation.\nTeams.\nAs is the practice in Asian baseball leagues like Japan's NPB and South Korea's KBO, many of the official team names in the Serie A include the team's corporate sponsor — though unlike Asian baseball, a sponsorship name does not necessarily indicate ownership.\n2023 \"poule scudetto\" teams.\nOf the 33 teams participating in the 2023 Serie A season, ten qualified for the \"poule scudetto\" (the championship pool). The top eight teams in the \"poule scudetto\" qualify for the postseason."

And that's not necessarily a bad idea -- having the entire tournament set up from the get-go -- but the execution isn't worth your download dollars.\"\nThe game sold 2.8 million copies."

The team represents the Otago, Southland and North Otago regions of New Zealand's South Island. Their main governing board is the Otago Cricket Association which is one of six major associations that make up New Zealand Cricket.\nCricket was first played in Otago in 1849, the year after the province was settled by Europeans, and the Otago Cricket Association was founded in 1876. The Otago representative team played in the first match which is considered to have first-class status to have been played in New Zealand, a January 1864 fixture with Canterbury which was part of a four team tournament which also included Southland and an English team led by George Parr which was touring Australia.\nThe modern Otago team plays most of its home games at the University Oval in Dunedin, but occasionally plays games at the Queenstown Events Centre, Queen's Park Ground in Invercargill and Molyneux Park in Alexandra.

        "text": "The 1979 NBA World Championship Series was the championship series played at the conclusion of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1978–79 season. The Western Conference champion Seattle SuperSonics played the Eastern Conference champion Washington Bullets, with the Bullets holding home-court advantage, due to a better regular season record. The SuperSonics defeated the Bullets 4 games to 1. The series was a rematch of the 1978 NBA Finals, which the Washington Bullets had won 4–3.\nDennis Johnson of the SuperSonics was named as the NBA Finals MVP, while Gus Williams of the SuperSonics was the top scorer, averaging 28.6 points per game.\nThis was Seattle's second men's professional sports championship, following the Seattle Metropolitans' victory in the 1917 Stanley Cup Finals. The city's next title wouldn't be until 2014 when the Seahawks won Super Bowl XLVIII.\nBoth the 1978 and 1979 NBA Finals were informally dubbed the \"George Washington series\", because both teams were playing in places named after the first President of the United States (the SuperSonics represented Seattle, Washington while the Bullets represented Washington, D.C., albeit playing in nearby Landover, Maryland).\nUntil 2023, this was the most recent time that a Western Conference team not based in Texas or California has won an NBA title, and the last of only two occasions alongside the 1976–77 Portland Trail Blazers when a team from the present-day Northwest Division has won the league title, which is by 27 years the longest league championship drought for any division of the four major North American sports leagues. Since then, the following Western teams have gone on to win an NBA title: the Los Angeles Lakers (eleven times), the San Antonio Spurs (five times), the Golden State Warriors (four times), the Houston Rockets (twice), and the Dallas Mavericks (once). The remaining twenty-one titles since 1980 have been won by Eastern Conference teams.\nBackground.\nThis was a rematch of the 1978 NBA Finals, which the Bullets won 4–3. Seattle lost Marvin Webster to the New York Knicks but acquired Lonnie Shelton in exchange. Other than that, both teams' rosters stayed virtually intact. Unlike the previous year, both teams finished 1–2 in the NBA, with the Bullets topping the league at 54 wins; the Sonics with 52 wins. In the playoffs, Seattle defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 4–1 and the Phoenix Suns 4–3, while Washington had a much tougher road, eliminating the Atlanta Hawks in an unexpectedly tough seven-game series and coming back from a 3–1 deficit to eliminate the San Antonio Spurs in seven. Both earned a first-round bye.\nTelevision.\nThe Finals were carried by CBS television (the network's NBA on CBS aired league games from 1973 to 1990), with Brent Musburger as the lead announcer. The 1979 Finals has been preserved in full, unlike the previous year's, in which Games 2, 3 and 4 are missing. (Except for 1978, all NBA Finals since 1975 have been completely preserved.)\nRegular season series.\nThe teams split the four-game series in the regular season:\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe Bullets controlled the game and led by 18 in the fourth, but Seattle mounted a furious comeback to tie it at 97. Larry Wright, who had 26 points off the bench, drove to the basket as time ran down and had his shot blocked by Dennis Johnson, but the referees called a foul on Johnson. Wright went to the line with one second left and hit two of three foul shots (NBA rules at the time awarded an extra free throw attempt when a team was in the penalty foul situation) to win the game.\nGame 2.\nElvin Hayes had 11 points in the first quarter, but only nine the rest of the way as Seattle turned its defense up a notch, holding the Bullets to 30 points in the second half.\nOutside of the two metropolitan areas of the competing teams, as well as Baltimore and Portland, the game was shown on tape delay beginning at 11:35 Eastern and Pacific/10:35 p.m. Central and Mountain. This was the first of six championship series games shown by CBS on tape delay over a three-season span. Four of the six games in the championship series two years later were shown on tape delay outside of the markets of the competing clubs.\nGame 3.\nSeattle dominated this game, which wasn't as close as the final margin indicated. Gus Williams scored 31 points, Jack Sikma had 21 and 17 rebounds, and Dennis Johnson had a fine all-around game with 17 points, 9 rebounds, and two blocked shots.\nGame 4.\nThe Sonics won a close one in OT 114–112, staving off a late Bullets comeback behind 36 points by Gus Williams and 32 by Dennis Johnson. Williams and Johnson dominated the Bullets' guards all series, as they were plagued by poor shooting. Johnson also had four blocks in the game, the last on Kevin Grevey with 4 seconds left to ensure the Seattle victory.\nGame 5.\nBack home, Elvin Hayes had a hot first half, scoring 20, but injuries to starting guards Tom Henderson, Kevin Grevey and prolonged poor shooting by their replacements took their toll. Hayes had only nine points in the second half as Seattle closed out the series."

        "text": "The 1978 NBA World Championship Series was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1977–78 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. The series featured the Western Conference champion Seattle SuperSonics against the Eastern Conference champion Washington Bullets. The Bullets defeated the SuperSonics in seven games to win their first NBA championship. Bullets power forward/center Wes Unseld was named MVP of the series. Before the Cleveland Cavaliers' Game 7 win at Golden State in the 2016 NBA Finals, this was the last time a road team had won Game 7 in the NBA Finals. The 1978 World Championship Series was the first NBA Finals series since the 1958 World Championship Series in which both teams had under 50 wins, and is the only NBA Finals to feature two teams with under 50 wins in an 82-game season.\nBackground.\nSeattle SuperSonics.\nThe Seattle SuperSonics had a disappointing start to the season, going 5–17 to begin with. Bob Hopkins, who replaced former Boston Celtics center Bill Russell as coach, was fired and Lenny Wilkens returned for a second tour of duty. The Sonics were led by rookie forward Jack Sikma, center Marvin Webster, forwards, Paul Silas and John Johnson, and guards Dennis Johnson and Gus Williams and Fred Brown. With Wilkens' experience being a key factor, the Sonics turned their season around, finishing with 47 wins and the fourth seed in the West. In the playoffs, they defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in a three-game miniseries, then upset the top-seeded and defending champion Portland Trail Blazers (who lost center Bill Walton in the second game of the series) in six games, before a six-game win over the Denver Nuggets in the Conference Finals sent them to their first of back-to-back NBA Finals appearances.\nWashington Bullets.\nThe Washington Bullets franchise made the Finals twice before in the 1970s, but were swept on both occasions, first by the Milwaukee Bucks in when they were still in Baltimore, and then by the Cinderella Golden State Warriors in . The Bullets kept some of the personnel from that 1975 team, including All-Stars Wes Unseld and Elvin Hayes, but Dick Motta was now in his second year of coaching duty. The Bullets struggled with injuries during the season, but managed to finish with 44 wins, good for the third seed in the East. In the playoffs, the Bullets disposed the Atlanta Hawks in a two-game first round series, then ousted the San Antonio Spurs in six games, before making the finals again with a six-game win over the defending Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers.\nFrom a KENS-TV Spurs broadcast in the San Antonio series after Washington took a 3–1 lead, Motta adopted the expression \"The 'opera' isn't over 'til the fat lady sings\" to warn Bullets fans against braggadocio. Motta also used an upbeat ostinato, \"Wait for the fat lady!\", to encourage the fans.\nRegular season series.\nWashington won the regular season series 3–1.\nSeries summary.\n\"Bullets win series 4–3\"\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe Bullets, behind Kevin Grevey's 27 and Elvin Hayes's 21 points, held a 19-point lead in the fourth quarter at the Seattle Center Coliseum. But, the Sonics staged a comeback in front of the home crowd, led by \"instant offense\" guard Fred Brown. Brown scored 16 points in the last nine minutes to finish with 30 and give the SuperSonics the win.\nGame 2.\nIn an unusual 1–2–2–1–1 scheduling format, the next two games were played at the Capital Centre, the Bullets' home floor. Wes Unseld defended inside on Marvin Webster and Jack Sikma, pulled down 15 rebounds, and handed out five assists. This work enabled Bob Dandridge to score 34 points and Elvin Hayes 25 as the Bullets evened the series, winning their first NBA Finals game following nine consecutive losses.\nGame 3.\nDennis Johnson was superb on defense, blocking seven shots and holding Kevin Grevey to 1-for-14 shooting. Paul Silas, the SuperSonics' veteran leader off the bench, helped shut down the Bullets' big men.\nWith 10 seconds remaining and the SuperSonics leading 93–90, Johnson's inbounds pass was stolen by Tom Henderson, who scored to make it 93–92 with five seconds left. Silas then stepped on the baseline trying to make the subsequent inbounds pass, turning the ball over to the Bullets. Bob Dandridge missed at the buzzer, however, and the SuperSonics picked up a victory on the road.\nGame 4.\nGame 4 was held in the Seattle Kingdome because the Seattle Center Coliseum was tied up with a mobile-home show. As a result, the Bullets had to contend with a then-record playoff crowd of over 39,000 fans.\nThe SuperSonics led by 15 with two minutes left in the third quarter. At this point, the Bullet guards, who had been victimized all series by Gus Williams and emerging star Dennis Johnson, started to assert themselves, especially reserves Charles Johnson and Larry Wright.\nAt the start of the final period, Dennis Johnson was elbowed hard in the ribs and left the game for a short time. With Charles Johnson, Wright, Mitch Kupchak and Bob Dandridge in the lineup, the Bullets stormed back and took a 103–101 lead with about 3.5 minutes left in the game. Dennis Johnson then returned and went on a barrage, scoring first to tie the game, blocking a Dandridge shot, getting an offensive rebound, and pushing the Sonics to a 104–103 lead with a foul shot. Johnson would finish with 33 points, seven rebounds and three blocks.\nDandridge answered with a three-point play that returned the lead to Washington, 106–104. Seattle got the ball back and tied it with \"instant offense\" Fred Brown's jumper from \"downtown\". With two seconds left, Dandridge got a good shot in the lane, only to have Johnson block it, forcing overtime. But then, Charles Johnson became an instant hero by hitting three quick shots in overtime to give the Bullets a 120–116 win. The Bullets had tied the series at two wins apiece.\nGame 5.\nThe SuperSonics returned to the Seattle Center Coliseum and eked out a close win. \"Downtown\" Freddie Brown had 26 points and Dennis Johnson 24 to carry Seattle to a 98–94 win and the series lead. The Bullets lost it at the line, making only 9 of 20 free throws in the second half. Even so, they cut Seattle's 11-point lead to two with less than two minutes to go before Jack Sikma hit three free throws down the stretch.\nGame 6.\nGame 6, in Washington, was all Bullets, 117–82. With the Washington backcourt continuing to struggle, Bullets coach Dick Motta inserted Greg Ballard at forward and moved Bob Dandridge to guard, a risky move considering Dandridge had played very little guard. Ballard and Dandridge produced a run that gave the Bullets a 12-point lead at the half. Washington scored 70 points in the second half, and the SuperSonics weren't up to that pace. Mitch Kupchak added 19 points, and Ballard had 12 points and 12 rebounds. The 35-point margin of victory was an NBA Finals record that stood until the 1998 NBA Finals Game 3 (96–54, 42 points).\nGame 7.\nDennis Johnson, who before the 1977–78 playoffs was a relatively unknown guard from Pepperdine University, had grown into a star in this series in front of a national TV audience. However, DJ would miss every one of his 14 shots in this game. Fellow guard Gus Williams was a bit more accurate, shooting 4-for-12. SuperSonics big men Marvin Webster scored 27 points and Jack Sikma 21 to take up the slack, and that kept it close.\nWith 90 seconds left, Seattle whittled the lead from 11 points down to four, but Mitch Kupchak came up with a three-point play. Fred Brown, who finished with 21 points off the bench, hit a short jumper, then Paul Silas got a tip-in to cut it to 101–99. Silas then fouled Wes Unseld, a 55-percent shooter from the line during the playoffs. He hit two free throws, and moments later Washington sealed it with a Bob Dandridge dunk, 105–99.\nCharles Johnson and Dandridge each scored 19 points for the Bullets, while Elvin Hayes fouled out with 12 points, a development that brought a couple of needling questions from the writers about his past failures in the playoffs and Hayes' cheerful comeback \"Whatever else they can say about me, they also got to say E's a world champion. E wears the ring.\" Unseld would be named Finals MVP.\nAfter the climactic Game 7 victory, Motta celebrated with his team wearing a beer-soaked \"The Opera Isn't Over 'Til The Fat Lady Sings\" T-shirt. He said, \"What made the championship so great was that we weren't supposed to win it. We came a long way. Most people didn't give us a chance, but I felt all along we could. I really did.\"\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision coverage.\nNationwide TV coverage of the 1978 NBA finals was broadcast by CBS Sports, with Brent Musburger (All Games) on play-by-play and Rick Barry (All Games), Steve Jones (Game 1), recently retired John Havlicek (Games 2, 4 and 7), Gus Johnson (Game 3) and Keith Erickson (Games 4 and 5) on color commentary. Locally, the 1978 NBA Finals was broadcast by CBS affiliates: WTOP-TV in Washington, D.C., and KIRO-TV in Seattle, Washington.\nNational coverage.\nNationwide radio coverage of the 1978 NBA Finals was broadcast by Mutual, with Tony Roberts on play-by-play and Hubie Brown on color commentary.\nLocal market coverage.\nThe flagship stations of each station of each team carried their local play-by-play calls. In Washington, D.C., WTOP-AM carried the series, with Frank Herzog on play-by-play. In Seattle, KOMO, carried the series with Bob Blackburn on play-by-play.\nAftermath.\nThe NBA received much criticism over the fact that the seven-game series was stretched out over 18 days, presumably for television; it remains the longest playoff series (in total number of days) ever played in any sport. (Even the 1989 World Series, interrupted for ten days by an earthquake, lasted only 15 days. However, that series ended in a sweep and, had it gone the full seven games, would have lasted 19 days).\nBoth teams met again in the 1979 finals, which Seattle won four games to one."

        "text": "The 1975 NBA World Championship Series was the championship round of the 1974–75 NBA season of the National Basketball Association. The Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors (48–34) played against the Eastern Conference champion Washington Bullets (60–22) for the championship. The series was played under a best-of-seven format. The underdog Warriors won in four games, sweeping the heavily favored Bullets to take the title. Warriors small forward Rick Barry was named as the series MVP.\nThe Warriors' home games were played at the Cow Palace in Daly City (near San Francisco) due to scheduling conflicts at their normal home court of Oakland Arena during the week of May 19–26. In addition, an odd scheduling format had to be used because Golden State could not secure the Cow Palace for Memorial Day Weekend (May 24–26). A \"Sports Illustrated\" article about the series reported that Washington, which held home court advantage, was given the option of a 1-2-2-1-1 scheduling format due to Golden State's problems or, if they wished, opening on the road and then having Games 2, 3, and 4 at home. Washington opted for the 1-2-2-1-1 format not out of a sense of fairness, but because they wanted to open the series at home.\nThe series is notable as it was the first championship game or series in any of the major U.S. professional sports leagues to feature two black head coaches or managers, as Al Attles coached the Warriors and K. C. Jones coached the Bullets.\nBackground.\nGolden State Warriors.\nThe Golden State Warriors last made the NBA Finals in , when they were still in San Francisco. In the years since, they moved to Oakland, briefly lost Rick Barry to the American Basketball Association, and named Warriors great Al Attles as head coach. Before the start of the 1974–75 season they traded future Hall of Famer Nate Thurmond to the Chicago Bulls for young center Clifford Ray. They also drafted Jamaal Wilkes, then known as Keith Wilkes, out of UCLA. With Barry as the offensive leader, and with Attles using a team approach to coaching, the Warriors managed to finish the season atop the Western Conference with 48 wins. In the playoffs, they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in six games, then eliminated Thurmond and the Bulls in seven games to advance to the Finals.\nWashington Bullets.\nThe Washington Bullets were in their second season in the Washington Metropolitan Area, having moved from Baltimore prior to the 1973–74 season. The Bullets, led by Wes Unseld and Elvin Hayes, and coached by K. C. Jones, won 60 games that season, then overcame the Buffalo Braves and the defending champion Boston Celtics in seven and six games, respectively. The Bullets franchise headed to their second NBA Finals appearance, the last of which was a sweep by the Milwaukee Bucks in .\nRegular season series.\nWashington won the regular season series 3–1.\nSeries summary.\nGolden State wins the series, 4–0.\nThis was the first time in NBA Finals history in which the team who did not have home court advantage swept the series. This has happened only one time since, in 1995, when the Houston Rockets swept the Orlando Magic.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nOpting to open the series at home, the Bullets built a 14-point lead at the half over the Warriors at the Capital Centre. The Warriors began to storm back, with Phil Smith coming off the bench to score 20 points in 31 minutes of playing time, as Golden State took the first game, 101–95.\nGame 2.\nInstead of their familiar Oakland Coliseum Arena, the Warriors were forced to play their first two scheduled home games of the series at the nearby Cow Palace (the Oakland facility being unavailable due to the Ice Follies). The Bullets jumped to an early 13-point lead, but Golden State battled back, led by 36 points from Rick Barry, to take a 92–91 lead in the closing seconds. Washington got the ball back with six seconds left but missed two shots and now were down 2–0.\nGame 3.\nRick Barry poured in 38 points and backup center George Johnson had 10 points and nine rebounds off the bench to help the Warriors to a key Game 3 109–101 win.\nTwo major factors enabling the Warriors to take an insurmountable lead were the defensive play of the seemingly undersized Jamaal Wilkes on Bullets' power forward Elvin Hayes and the play of the Warrior bench. In three games, Hayes had only 29 points and the Warriors' bench players had outscored the Bullets' reserves 115–53.\nGame 4.\nBack at home, the Bullets seemed to be on their way to staving off an unexpected sweep by the underdog Warriors, leading by 14 points early on. Bullets forward Mike Riordan was assigned to guard Barry, who had killed the Bullets in the series up to that point by averaging 35 points a game. Riordan played Barry very physically, arousing the ire of Warriors' coach Al Attles. Midway through the first quarter, Barry went on a drive to the basket and was fouled hard from behind by Riordan. Barry reacted with a shove, but Attles bolted onto the court and initiated a fight of his own with Riordan, thereby protecting his star player from an ejection and getting ejected himself. The remainder of the game was directed by assistant coach Joe Roberts.\nThe Bullets controlled the game and led most of the way, leading by as many as eight in the fourth quarter at 90-82 after a Riordan drive and layup where he injured his ankle. Bullets coach K.C. Jones pulled Riordan and sent in little-used Dick Gibbs, with Nick Weatherspoon mired in a shooting slump. Barry and Hayes exchanged baskets, keeping the Bullets up by eight at 92–84. After a Jamaal Wilkes basket, Kevin Porter missed a pair of free throws and Butch Beard hit a jumper to cut the Bullet lead to four at 92–88. Porter then threw away an easy pass on the Bullets' next trip, and Wilkes canned a jumper to cut it to two at 92–90. Porter missed a layup, and then Wilkes hit a rebound basket to tie the score. Hayes, who had only 15 points, then hit one of two to give the lead back to the Bullets. Beard answered with a drive and basket to give the Warriors a 94–93 lead. Unseld then threw away an easy bounce pass to give the ball back to the Warriors with 1:26 left. With 1:08 left, Barry put up a jumper and missed, and Hayes hit a wide-open Gibbs with an outlet pass, but Gibbs blew the layup. The Warriors turned the ball over on a 24-second violation with 33 seconds left, but the Bullets gave it back to them after a timeout when Unseld fumbled an inbounds pass into the backcourt. Beard then hit one of two, then one of three to give the Warriors their final margin.\nTelevision coverage.\nCBS broadcast the 1975 NBA Finals in the United States, with Brent Musburger on play-by-play and Oscar Robertson on color commentary. With Rick Barry playing for the Warriors in this series, the recently retired Robertson filled his spot; Barry went on to cover the next six NBA Finals, five of which while still an active player. The 1975 Finals is also the oldest NBA championship series whose TV coverage still exists in its entirety, as do all subsequent Finals (except 1978, which has three of its seven contests missing).\nAftermath.\nThe Washington Bullets would re-appear in the NBA Finals in 1978 and 1979 against the Seattle SuperSonics, with a series win in seven games and a series loss in five games respectively.\nThe Golden State Warriors won their next championship 40 years later in against the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games, ending one of the longest droughts between championships in NBA history."

        "text": "The 1974 NBA World Championship Series was the championship round of the 1973–74 National Basketball Association (NBA) season. The Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics defeated the Western Conference champion Milwaukee Bucks 4 games to 3 to win the NBA championship. This would mark the last time the Celtics won a playoff game 7 on the road until 2022, when they defeated the Miami Heat in game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals in Miami.\nBackground.\nMilwaukee Bucks.\nThe Milwaukee Bucks returned to the NBA Finals after a three-year absence. Some of the cast from the 1971 championship team, such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then Lew Alcindor), Jon McGlocklin, Bob Dandridge and the retiring Oscar Robertson returned for another title run; however, starting guard Lucius Allen, who averaged 17.6 points and 5.2 assists per game, was injured and did not play in the series. The Bucks eliminated the Los Angeles Lakers and the Chicago Bulls in five and four games, respectively, to advance to the Finals.\nBoston Celtics.\nThe Boston Celtics won a franchise record 68 games in the 1972–73 season, but a shoulder injury to John Havlicek quashed their title hopes, as they lost in seven games to the New York Knicks in the conference finals. Havlicek returned healthier for the 1973–74 season, and with Dave Cowens, Paul Silas and Jo Jo White entering the prime of their careers, the Celtics appeared poised for another title run. The Celtics, though winning 12 fewer games than the previous season, made the Finals, defeating the Buffalo Braves in six games before ousting the defending champion New York Knicks in five games.\nRegular season series.\nThese teams split the four-game season series, each winning once at home and on the road. \nSeries summary.\n\"Celtics win series 4–3\"\nGame 1.\nBefore the series started, Bucks point guard Lucius Allen would be lost for the series with a knee injury. In Game 1, the Celtics took advantage, harassing a 35-year-old Oscar Robertson and Allen's replacement, Ron Williams, into frequent turnovers. The Celtics took a 35–19 lead in the first quarter and never looked back on the way to a 98–83 win in Milwaukee. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored 35 points for the Bucks.\nGame 2.\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar scored 36 points, but more importantly, he took more of a role in running the Bucks' offense from the post, given their backcourt issues. His passing enabled Bob Dandridge to score 24 points.\nOn the defensive end, Abdul-Jabbar forced Dave Cowens into shooting 8-of-22 from the floor, including a block of a Cowens shot at the end of regulation to force overtime. The Bucks won 105–96 to even the series at a game apiece as it headed to Boston.\nThis game, played on April 30, was the last NBA Championship Series game played in the month of April to date.\nGame 3.\nSensing he was no match for Abdul-Jabbar in the paint, Dave Cowens decided to shoot more from the outside and scored 30 points, despite foul trouble that reduced him to 32 minutes of playing time. The Celtics' press also turned up the heat, forcing 11 first-quarter turnovers and helping Boston to a 21-point lead. With Cowens in foul trouble, seldom-used 7-footer Henry Finkel did an admirable job of spot defense on Abdul-Jabbar, who finished with 26 points. At game's end, the Bucks had turned the ball over 27 times, enough for a 95–83 Boston win.\nThis would be the last time the home team won in the series.\nGame 4.\nWith Ron Williams unable to handle the Celtics' press and shooting guard Jon McGlocklin nursing a sprained ankle, Bucks coach Larry Costello turned to little-used forward Mickey Davis for help in the backcourt. Davis at 6'7\" presented matchup problems on offense for Jo Jo White, forcing Celtics coach Tom Heinsohn to assign Don Chaney to guard him. This enabled Oscar Robertson to more effectively set up the Bucks' offense.\nDavis contributed 15 points and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar shredded the Celtics for 34 points and six assists from the low post. Milwaukee got the lead and kept it down the stretch for a 97–89 win at Boston Garden, thereby regaining homecourt advantage.\nGame 5.\nThe Celtics stole the homecourt advantage back with a 96–87 win in Milwaukee. John Havlicek and Dave Cowens scored 28 points each and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored 37 points. They would have a chance to close it out at home in Game 6.\nGame 6.\nDave Cowens got into foul trouble early and watched from the bench as Milwaukee took a 12-point lead in the first half. The Celtics were down by six late in the game, but they came back to force overtime. John Havlicek hit a long jumper to tie it at 86–86 with a little over a minute left, then Oscar Robertson was caught in a 24-second violation as time expired. In the first overtime, Milwaukee led 90-88 when Don Chaney got a steal and passed to Havlicek. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was back on defense and forced Havlicek to take a pull-up jumper. Havlicek missed but got the long rebound and scored to send the game into a second overtime.\nThe second overtime was a furious nip-and-tuck affair, with the lead changing hands 11 times. After Bob Dandridge hit a pair of free throws, Havlicek, who had nine of his team's 11 points in the period, hit a short jumper from the baseline and was fouled by Dandridge. Havlicek hit the foul shot to put the Celtics up 93–92. Then, the frenzied exchange of baskets occurred with neither team leading by more than a point. Abdul-Jabbar hit a skyhook, then Havlicek hit a jumper. Oscar Robertson then scored the next two Bucks baskets, sandwiching a Jo Jo White jumper. Then, Havlicek scored again. On the next possession, Dave Cowens fouled Abdul-Jabbar in the lane, his sixth.\nMickey Davis put the Bucks up 100–99 with a basket with 24 seconds left. With the shot clock turned off, the Celtics worked for a final shot. Coach Tom Heinsohn screamed for a timeout, but with seven seconds left, Havlicek lofted a baseline rainbow over Abdul-Jabbar for a 101–100 lead.\nThe Bucks called for a timeout, and instead of setting up a play for Abdul-Jabbar, strangely decided to set up a play for a hobbled Jon McGlocklin where Abdul-Jabbar would set a pick from the high post. McGlocklin couldn't get free, however, and Davis was covered as he cut to the basket. Abdul-Jabbar, with the ball, moved to the right of the lane, dribbled to the baseline, and let fly a \"sky-hook\" from 17 feet which swished in with two seconds left. Jo Jo White put up a failed desperation heave, and that was it. The series was tied at three games apiece and going back to Milwaukee.\nHavlicek ended with a game-high 36 points and Abdul-Jabbar led the Bucks with 34 points, including the game-winner.\nGame 7.\nHome court advantage apparently meant very little in this series. The Celtics decided to abandon man-to-man defense and double and triple team Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who still scored 26 points. This freed Dave Cowens more on the offensive end, as he hit 8 of 13 shots in the first half on his way to 28 points and 14 rebounds. John Havlicek added 16 as the Celtics cruised to an easy 102–89 win and their first title in the \"post-Bill Russell era.\"\nAftermath.\nThis was the Bucks' last appearance in the NBA Finals until 2021, winning their 2nd title and the first in 50 years. The Celtics returned to the finals two years later, winning their 13th title. They would go on to win 3 more titles during the \"Larry Bird era\" and have won a total of 4 titles in 8 Finals appearances since 1981.\nTelevision.\nThis was the first of 16 consecutive NBA Finals to be televised by CBS. It was the only NBA Finals called by Pat Summerall, best known for his work on the Masters Tournament and the National Football League. His partners on color commentary were Rick Barry and Hot Rod Hundley."

        "text": "The 1973 NBA World Championship Series was the championship series of the 1972–73 National Basketball Association (NBA) season, and the culmination of that season's playoffs. The Eastern Conference champion New York Knicks defeated the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers 4 games to 1 to win their second championship. The series was an exact reversal of the prior year, this time with the Lakers winning Game 1 and the Knicks taking the next four games. Knicks center Willis Reed was named as the NBA Finals MVP.\nBackground.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers entered the 1973 NBA Playoffs as co-favorites in the West with the Milwaukee Bucks, but both teams faced inspired opponents in the first round. The Chicago Bulls gave the Lakers all they could handle before the Lakers came from behind in Game 7 to take the series. The Lakers next faced the Golden State Warriors for the Western Conference championship (the Warriors had upset the Bucks in six games). In Game 1, the Lakers won by 2, and in Game 2 the Lakers won by 10. In Game 3 at Oakland, the Lakers routed the Warriors 126–70, but the Warriors won Game 4 to send the series back to Los Angeles. In the Forum, the Lakers took Game 5 and advanced to their fifth NBA Finals series in six seasons.\nNew York Knicks.\nOne year after their NBA Finals loss, the Knicks were back in the playoffs. For some of the Knicks, including Jerry Lucas and Earl Monroe, this was probably their last shot at an NBA title. In the first round they paired against the Baltimore Bullets. The Knicks won games 1 and 2 in New York, but lost Game 3 at Baltimore (in that game, the Bullets used a strange lineup of two centers and three guards). New York would take Games 4 and 5 and Walt Frazier averaged 20 points per game in this series. In the Conference Finals, the Knicks faced the 68–14 Boston Celtics, who not only had the league's best record but also, to that point, the third-best won-lost record in NBA history. The Celtics routed New York, 134–108, Game 1 at the Boston Garden, but the Knicks returned the favor with a 129–96 rout in Game 2 at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks then beat the Celtics in Game 3 in Boston, and took a 3–1 series lead with a double overtime Easter Sunday win back in New York. Boston came back with two critical wins, winning 98–97 in Boston on two Paul Silas free throws, then regaining the home-court advantage with a 110–100 win at New York in Game 6. For Game 7, however, the Celtics were without their star John Havlicek, who was nursing an elbow injury. In that Game 7, played in Boston, the Celtics unbeaten record in seventh games played in Boston Garden was snapped when New York won easily, 94–78.\nSeries summary.\nAfter losing the first game, the Knicks reeled off four straight wins to reclaim the NBA title. This is the Knicks' most recent NBA Championship to date. New York would not make it back to the NBA Finals until 1994.\nThis would also be the last Finals appearance of the decade for the Lakers. Their next appearance would be in 1980, which would be the first of nine Finals appearances in 12 years for the franchise.\n\"Knicks win series 4-1\"\nThis was the only NBA Championship for Jerry Lucas and Earl Monroe.\nGame 5 of the series was Wilt Chamberlain's last game played in the NBA. Chamberlain scored the last points of the game, and of his career, on an uncontested fast break dunk with one second remaining.\nABC televised its last NBA Finals, until 2003. This is, to date, the last time a New York/Los Angeles NBA Finals of any combination has taken place, as well as the fifth-to-last championship series contested by both cities in any sport (the 1981 World Series is the last matchup in the 20th century, and the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals is the latest)."

        "text": "The 1972 NBA World Championship Series was the championship round played at the conclusion of the 1971–72 National Basketball Association (NBA) season. The Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference champion New York Knicks in five games to win their sixth title. The Lakers won their first NBA championship since the franchise moved to Los Angeles from Minneapolis, Minnesota. \nBackground.\nThe 1972 NBA Finals was a rematch of the 1970 NBA Finals that the Knicks had won in a full seven-game series.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe 1971-72 Lakers won a then NBA-record 69 regular season games, including 33 wins in a row—a record which still stands. The 69 wins would remain a record for the most wins in a season until the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls (who were coached by former Knicks player Phil Jackson) broke it in route to a 72-win season that also resulted in a championship. The Lakers were led by Wilt Chamberlain, the NBA's top rebounder that season. Guards Gail Goodrich and Jerry West were each among the NBA's top ten scorers. The Lakers were the league highest-scoring team, averaging 121 points per game. West also led the NBA in assists. \nLos Angeles swept a solid 57-win Chicago Bulls team in the playoffs' opening round, then defeated the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks (record of 63–19) in six games to win the Western Conference Finals. That historic series had matched Chamberlain against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and West against Oscar Robertson.\nNew York Knicks.\nNew York was a top defensive team that allowed just 98.2 points per game and made 47% of their shots as a team. They had defeated the 38-win Baltimore Bullets and then upset the 56-win Boston Celtics to win the Eastern Conference Finals.\nSeries summary.\n\"Lakers win series 4–1\"\nGame-by-game summary.\nGame 1.\nWillis Reed was out with a knee injury, but his replacement, Jerry Lucas, scored 26 points on 13 of 21 shooting to lead the Knicks to the win in the series opener. Lucas, a 6'9\" center, was an excellent outside shooter. Chamberlain would not pursue him far from the basket and preferred to position for rebounds instead. The intelligent Lucas exploited this fact.\nBut Lucas was not the only Knick who was red hot. Bill Bradley hit 11 of 12 shots from the field as New York shot 53 percent as a team for the game. The team took advantage of a nearly perfect first half to jump to a good lead and won easily, 114-92. New York hit 16 of their first 20 shots and led after each quarter. The win was considered a surprising upset.\nDave DeBusschere added 19 points and 18 rebounds. Walt Frazier triple-doubled with 14 points, 11 assists and 12 rebounds.\nThe high-scoring Lakers backcourt of Jerry West and Gail Goodrich shot a cold 11 of 37, and no Los Angeles players took up their slack.\nGame 2.\nHeavily criticized for their Game 1 loss in the home opener, the Lakers looked to avenge themselves on their home court again. But at halftime, the Lakers' lead was just 51-50.\nKnicks forward DeBusschere, straining in position battles against the gigantic Chamberlain, hurt his side and did not play after the first half. The loss of DeBusschere, a key New York rebounder and defender, would badly hurt the team's chances from this point forward. He had played 43 minutes in Game 1, and the Knicks relied on him heavily.\nAlso playing hurt was New York guard Earl Monroe. The Lakers' Gail Goodrich took advantage and netted 31 points. The still cold-shooting West simply passed and had 13 assists.\nChamberlain took advantage of DeBusschere's absence and pulled down 24 rebounds, controlling the middle at both ends of the court.\nLucas had foul trouble and sat much of the third quarter, with New York scoring just 11 points in the period. A New York rally in the fourth quarter could not stop a 106-92 Los Angeles win to even the series.\nBoth teams used short rotations during the series. Los Angeles played each of its starters 40 minutes or more in Game 2, with Chamberlain playing all 48. New York figured to do the same, but now had to deal with injury issues to DeBusschere and Monroe.\nGame 3.\nThe Knicks' Dave DeBusschere was listed as doubtful for Game Three. Despite injury issues, New York fans were optimistic as the series now headed to Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks went 5-0 vs. the Bullets and Celtics in route to the Finals. The Knicks had gotten their ' split ' in two games in Los Angeles, and now had a chance to take control of the series.\nDeBusschere gamely attempted to play in the first half, but simply could not overcome his injury. He missed all six of his field-goal attempts. He was hurting and elected not to play in the second half. DeBusschere explained: \"I didn't feel I was helping the team\".\nLucas, the star of Game 1, tried to take up DeBusschere's slack. He hit 11 of 21 shots for 23 total points and 14 rebounds in 47 minutes of play. He also added a team-high six assists.\nFrazier added 25 points himself. Bradley went a cold 5 of 17.\nThe Lakers led 52-47 at the half, and with DeBusschere out, took over the game again in the third quarter. Chamberlain and Laker forward Happy Hairston collected 20 rebounds apiece, with the Laker giant also adding 26 points on 9 of 10 shooting. West and Goodrich combined for 46 points, and Los Angeles danced out to a 22-point lead and took a 2-1 lead in the series with a 107-96 win.\nNineteen thousand five-hundred New York fans watched the contest.\nGame 4.\nThe Knicks felt that Game 4 was a must-win game. DeBusschere vowed to play, lasting 48 minutes and pulling down a team-high 13 rebounds. New York led 56-53 at the half. After an even third quarter, the Lakers rallied in the fourth. West made a clutch basket to give the Lakers the lead with seconds left, but a Frazier tip-in over Chamberlain evened the score. West missed at the buzzer, sending the game into overtime tied 101-101. The Lakers would outscore New York 15-10 in the extra frame to win 116-111 and take a commanding 3-1 series lead back to Los Angeles.\nAll five Los Angeles starters played at least 45 minutes in Game 4, with Lakers coach Bill Sharman using just seven players total. Chamberlain played all 53 minutes and had 24 rebounds. The Laker starting guards combined for 56 points to again key the team.\nIn the game New York had two players that played at least 50 minutes. Lucas played all 53 minutes, and had 25 points on 11-22 shooting, with 11 assists and eight rebounds. Frazier had 24 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in 50 minutes.\nGame 5.\nChamberlain was listed as doubtful for Game Five with a sprained right wrist.\nThe Lakers returned home looking to win their first title in Los Angeles. After playing to a 53-all tie at halftime, The Lakers finally pulled away from the tired Knicks in the second half.\nChamberlain dominated the middle, flirting with what would've been a quadruple-double with 24 points, 29 rebounds, eight blocks and eight assists in 47 minutes. Blocked shots were not an official NBA stat at that time, but ABC announcer Keith Jackson counted them up during the broadcast. West and Goodrich combined for 48 points.\nWalt Frazier had 27 points, 10 assists, and seven rebounds in 47 minutes for the Knicks.\nThe Lakers won 114-100 to claim their first NBA Championship in Los Angeles. For the series, Chamberlain averaged 19.4 points and 23.2 rebounds and was named Finals Most Valuable Player.\nWest had averaged 19.8 points and 8.8 assists, and Goodrich averaged 25.2 points for the series.\nAftermath.\nThe teams would meet again in the finals the following year, as the Knicks would get their revenge. In a reversal of the 1972 series, the Knicks would win four in a row after losing the opener to win their second NBA title in four years."

        "text": "The 1971 NBA Finals was the championship series played at the conclusion of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 25th anniversary season of 1970–71. The Western Conference champion Milwaukee Bucks, who were founded as an expansion team three years earlier, swept the Eastern Conference champion Baltimore Bullets in four games. Baltimore had dethroned the 1969–70 NBA champion New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference finals.\nThe Bucks were the first Western Conference champions to win the league's championship since the St. Louis Hawks did so in 1958, and were the first expansion team in the NBA to win a championship since the NBA held its first expansion draft.

It was also the first NBA title by a Western Conference team that has not since folded or relocated.\nThe Bullets were forced to play Game 1 on a Wednesday night, just 48 hours after having defeated New York in Game 7 of the 1971 Eastern Conference Finals, then had to wait four days before playing Game 2.\nThe series was the second (and last) time in NBA history that the teams alternated home games, the other being in . Most other series were held in the 2-2-1-1-1 or 2-3-2 format (a 1-2-2-1-1 format was used in 1975 and 1978). It was also the last NBA Championship Series completed before May 1.\nThe series was broadcast by ABC with Chris Schenkel and Jack Twyman providing the commentary. This was the last playoff series broadcast for both Schenkel and Twyman; they were replaced the next season as the lead announcing team by Keith Jackson and Bill Russell, who served two years before ABC lost the national television contract to CBS after the 1972-73 season.\nUntil 2021, it was the Bucks' only and the city's second championship (with the other being the Braves).

        "text": "The 1970 NBA World Championship Series was the championship series of the 1970 NBA Playoffs, which concluded the 1969–70 National Basketball Association (NBA) season. The Eastern Division champion New York Knicks defeated the Western Division champion Los Angeles Lakers in a best-of-seven series 4 games to 3 for their first NBA title.\nThe Knicks appeared to have a see-saw Game 3 won when Dave DeBusschere made a shot with three seconds left to give New York a 102–100 edge and the Lakers were stuck with no time outs. L.A. inbounded to Mr. Clutch, Jerry West, who launched and made a miracle shot from beyond midcourt. It counted only for two points, as only the ABA had a three-point shot at the time, so the game went to overtime, and the Knicks were able to win, 111–108.\nThe final game of the series was named by ESPN in 2010 as the greatest Game 7 in finals history, featuring a return from injury for Willis Reed. Reed's most famous performance took place on May 8, 1970 in Game 7 played at Madison Square Garden. Due to a severe thigh injury suffered in Game 5, a torn muscle that kept him out of Game 6, he was considered unlikely to play in Game 7. Yet Reed surprised the fans by walking onto the court during warmups, prompting widespread applause. Starting the game, he scored the Knicks' first two field goals on his first two shot attempts, his only points of the game. He then played defense on Wilt Chamberlain, limiting him to two shots made in nine attempts. When Reed left for good with 3:05 left in the first half, the Knicks led 61–37. Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier took it from there, finishing with 36 points and 19 assists as the Knicks won the championship, 113–99. Following the game in the winner's locker room, a moved Howard Cosell told Reed on national television, \"You exemplify the very best that the human spirit can offer.\"\nSeries summary.\n\"Knicks win series 4–3\"\nSource:\nTelevision.\nThe 1970 NBA Finals were the first to be nationally televised in full, with ABC providing the coverage. Chris Schenkel was the play-by-play man, with Jack Twyman serving as the color analyst. Howard Cosell provided interviews from the Knicks' locker room following Game 7 and was famously doused with champagne.\nHowever, the Knicks' victory in Game 7 was not seen live on broadcast TV in New York; ABC's coverage was blacked out on WABC-TV, causing a raft of angry fans to deluge the WABC switchboard. Schenkel made an announcement during the broadcast that the game would be aired in New York at 11:30 p.m. that night. The game \"was\" shown live on the premium-channel MSG Network in New York City, which was then only available in about 25,000 cable households in Manhattan.\nSince the 1970 finals, every NBA Finals game has been carried across the United States, though local blackouts would take some time to subside.\nPlayer statistics.\nSource:"

The best-of-seven series was played between the Western Division champion San Francisco Warriors and the Eastern Division champion Philadelphia 76ers. This was the first championship series in 11 years without the Boston Celtics, who were defeated in the Division Finals by Philadelphia, the first time since 1958 and the only time in the 1960s that the Boston Celtics did not win the NBA Finals. It matched two teams who had each relocated in the decade, as the Warriors had moved from Philadelphia to San Francisco in 1962 and the 76ers had been relocated from Syracuse, New York to replace the void left by the Warriors. Wilt Chamberlain had been the star of the Warriors since joining the team in 1959 (which included an MVP Award) but was traded to the 76ers in the middle of the 1965 season.\nUnder first-year head coach Alex Hannum (who had been fired by the Warriors the previous season) and an approach to have Chamberlain focus more on defense rather than scoring (which resulted in a shooting percentage of 68.3%), Philadelphia dominated the regular season with a 68–13 record, the most regular season wins in NBA history at the time as Chamberlain won his third MVP award. While they did win in six games, it was a tight affair that saw numerous records set (most notably by Rick Barry, who scored the second most amount of points by a player in a Finals at the time) as Game 1 required overtime and the decisive Game 6 saw the 76ers rally back from a six-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win the championship. With the win, Alex Hannum (who had led the St. Louis Hawks to the NBA title in 1958) became the first coach to win a championship with two different franchises, a mark that has since been matched by just two other head coaches in NBA history.\nSeries summary.\n\"76ers win series 4–2\"\n\"* denotes overtime\"\nGame summaries.\nGame 2.\nWilt Chamberlain set a record for rebounds in a half with 26 in the first half.\nGame 3.\nScoring a postseason career-high 55 points on 48 attempts, Rick Barry tied the record set by Wilt Chamberlain in the 1962 playoffs for field goal attempts in one postseason game.\nGame 6.\nThe two teams combined for 84 points in the first quarter, which set a new postseason record. It was matched in the 1994 playoffs and 2003 but has not been surpassed. The 76ers were trailing 106-102 early in the fourth quarter before Matt Guokas, a bench player for a majority of the season, took a quick pass off a rebound to throw in a 20-foot shot and quickly getting the ball again on a break and taking on Nate Thurmond when driving to the rim for a layup that tied the game along with knocking him out of the game when he crashed into the basket support. Chamberlain later exclaimed, \"Gook! Gook! The rook showed us how!\" In the final quarter, Chamberlain recorded eight rebounds and six blocks. The Warriors were trailing 123–122 with under 20 seconds remaining. An attempted pick and roll by Barry and Thurmond against Chamberlain saw a defensive struggle as Barry could not get a clean shot off when Chamberlain shifted his focus to Thurmond on an attempted pass, and a jump ball was forced on the rebound. Philadelphia scored a two-point shot to close out the scoring."

The Eastern Division champion Boston Celtics faced the Western Division champion Los Angeles Lakers in a best-of-seven series that the Celtics won 4 games to 3. For the Celtics this was their tenth straight finals appearance, which tied a North American professional sports record set by the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens from 1951 to 1960, and the National Football League's Cleveland Browns from 1946 to 1955.\nThus Boston won its eighth consecutive league title, which no other team has achieved in North American professional sports competition. Before Game 2, after the Los Angeles Lakers' comeback overtime win in Game 1, Red Auerbach, who had challenged the entire league to topple the Celtics from their reign by announcing he would retire after 1965–1966 before the season had started (thus giving his detractors \"one last shot\" at him), announced Bill Russell as the Celtics' coach for 1966–1967 and beyond. He would be the first African-American to coach in the NBA. Laker coach Fred Schaus privately fumed that Auerbach's hiring had taken away all of the accolades his Lakers should have received following their tremendous Game 1 win. The Celtics won the next three games and looked ready to close out L.A. in Game 5. However, the Lakers won the next two games, setting the stage for another classic Game 7 in the Boston Garden. The Celtics raced out to a huge lead, and held off a late Los Angeles rally to capture the NBA title and send Red Auerbach out a champion.\nThis was the last NBA championship series until 2016 in which a team trailing 3 games to 1 rallied to force a Game 7.\nSeries summary.\n\"Celtics win series 4–3\"\nTeam rosters.\nBoston Celtics.\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; ;\"|Boston Celtics 1965–66 Eastern Division Championship Roster\n!

This was the last Finals until 1967 that was not won by the Celtics, and the last until 1971 that was won by the Western Division or Conference.\nRecap.\nAfter being defeated by the Celtics in Game 7 of the 1957 NBA Finals, St. Louis survived a sometimes difficult 1957-58 NBA season en route to winning the Western Division crown with a 41-31 record. The Celtics, meanwhile, had dominated the Eastern Division with a 49-23 record.\nThe Hawks upset the Celtics (with a healthy Russell) in Game 1 at the Boston Garden, 104-102. Boston struck back with a wipeout in Game 2, 136-112. In St. Louis, the Hawks prevailed 111-108 in Game 3 when Russell severely sprained his ankle. Without Russell, the Celtics evened the series with a 109-98 surprise victory in Game 4. St. Louis forced a 102-100 win in Game 5 in Boston to take the series lead.\nBack home in Kiel Auditorium on April 12, the Hawks weren't about to miss their opportunity to defeat the defending champions. Pettit turned in a spectacular performance. He scored 31 points in the first three quarters, then zoomed off in the final period, nailing 19 of his team's last 21 points. His last two points, on a tip-in with 15 seconds remaining, put the Hawks ahead 110-107. The Celtics scored one final bucket but could do no more. The Hawks finally had a title, 110-109. Pettit had scored 50 points, including 18 of the Hawks' final 21 points in propelling the Hawks to the championship. Pettit's 50 points set a new Finals record for most scored by a player in a series-clinching game, a record that would finally be tied by Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2021\nMost observers figured that the Celtics probably would have won the 1958 title if Russell had not suffered his ankle injury in game 3. Auerbach, however, found no comfort in that opinion. \"You can always look for excuses,\" he said. \"We just got beat.\"\nSeries summary.\n\"Hawks win series 4–2\""

Because of the arena not believing Fort Wayne would make the NBA Finals, the arena was booked and not available, and the Fort Wayne home games were played in Indianapolis.\nIt has been alleged that some Fort Wayne players conspired with gamblers to throw the series to Syracuse. The suspicious nature of the seventh game in particular has raised concerns about the legitimacy of the series. Fort Wayne led Syracuse 41–24 early in the second quarter, then allowed the Nationals to rally to win the game. Andy Phillip, who turned the ball over with three seconds left in the game, was believed by at least one of his teammates, George Yardley, to have thrown the game. \"There were always unwholesome implications about that ball game\", Yardley told the author Charley Rosen. However, Phillip may not have acted alone. Other Pistons players were strongly believed to have thrown games during the 1954 and 1955 NBA seasons. In fact, Yardley himself turned the ball over to Syracuse with a palming violation with 18 seconds remaining in Game 7. The foul that gave Syracuse its winning free throw, meanwhile, was committed by Frankie Brian. The NBA did not return to the 2–3–2 format until 1985.

The Western Division champion Rochester Royals faced the Eastern Division champion New York Knicks in a best-of-seven series with Rochester having home-court advantage.\nRochester won the first three games, two at home, but New York won the next three, two at home. It was the first BAA or NBA Finals (spanning 1947 to 1951) that extended to a seventh-game conclusion, a 4-point win by Rochester at home on Saturday, April 21.\nThe seven games were played in fifteen days, beginning Saturday and Sunday, April 7 and 8, in Rochester and incorporating one game in Rochester on each following weekend. Three Wednesday or Friday games were played in New York City. The entire postseason tournament spanned 33 days in which both Rochester and New York played 14 games.\nThe Royals appeared in their first NBA finals by defeating the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals and the two-time defending champion Minneapolis Lakers in the division finals while the Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics in the semifinals and the Syracuse Nationals in the division finals.

The Royals would spend 15 years mired in mediocrity before moving to Kansas City in 1972, changing their name in the process to the Kings. One notable highlight was their appearance in the 1981 NBA Playoffs, in which their 40-42 team reached the Conference Finals before losing to the Houston Rockets who also had a 40–42 record. The Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985. The team reached the conference finals in the 2002 NBA Playoffs, their closest to reaching the NBA finals in recent years. The Royals/Kings have the longest NBA title drought, and also the longest Finals appearance drought in NBA history and actively in all of the American major four pro sports leagues.\nThis would be the Knicks first of three consecutive appearances in the Finals, but they would lose all three times. They would not return to the Finals until 1970, which they won."

        "title": "2007 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2007 proceeded according to revised rules enacted in 2001. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) held an election to select from among recent players, resulting in the induction of Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripken Jr.\nThe Veterans Committee held an election with two ballots: the biennial election for players retired over 20 years, and the quadrennial election for non-players (managers, umpires and executives), the first since 2003. The Committee did not elect anyone.\nInduction ceremonies in Cooperstown were held July 29 with Commissioner Bud Selig presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1987 or later, but not after 2001; the ballot announced on November 27, 2006, included candidates from the 2006 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 2001. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate who received votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2007 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 9. The ballot consisted of 32 players; a record 545 ballots were cast, with 409 votes required for election. A total of 3584 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.58 per ballot. Those candidates who received less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). There were 15 candidates returning from the 2006 ballot. The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nSteve Garvey was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly-eligible candidates included 26 All-Stars, eight of whom were selected at least five times, and ten of whom were not even included on the ballot. For only the second time (equalling 1982), three players with 400 home runs were among the new candidates; the five newly eligible players with 300 home runs were a new high (exceeding the 1980 total), and the twelve new candidates with 200 home runs shattered the previous high mark of eight, set in 1992. With the exception of the first balloting in 1936, it was the second time that two players with 3000 hits debuted on the ballot (Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripken Jr.), and also the second time that two players with 1500 RBI made their initial appearances (Ripken and Harold Baines). Again excepting 1936, the numbers of newly eligible candidates with 2000 hits (7), 2500 hits (3), 1000 RBI (9), 1200 RBI (5), 3000 total bases (11), 3500 total bases (5) or 4000 total bases (3) all tied or broke previous records. The field included three MVP Award Winners (Ken Caminiti, Jose Canseco, and Cal Ripken Jr., who won the award twice), one Cy Young Award winner (Bret Saberhagen, twice awarded), and four Rookie of the Year Award winners (Cal Ripken Jr., Mark McGwire, Jose Canseco, and Gregg Olson, who was not even on the ballot). As expected, Gwynn and Ripken were elected on the first ballot; the other first-time candidates were generally seeking simply enough votes to remain on the ballot for the 2008 election, when a much less crowded field was expected. However, of the first-timers who were not elected, only two—McGwire and Baines—received enough votes to make the 2008 ballot, and had Baines received two fewer votes, he also would have become ineligible for BBWAA consideration.\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Derek Bell, Willie Blair, Brian Bohanon, Ricky Bones, Jeff Brantley, Norm Charlton, Chad Curtis, Rob Ducey, Mark Gardner, Bernard Gilkey, Craig Grebeck, Darryl Hamilton, Pete Harnisch, Charlie Hayes, Doug Henry, Gil Heredia, Glenallen Hill, Ken Hill, John Jaha, Stan Javier, Randy Knorr, Mark Leiter, Mark Lewis, Dave Magadan, Dave Martinez, Ramón Martínez, Chuck McElroy, Alan Mills, Omar Olivares, Joe Oliver, Gregg Olson, Scott Radinsky, Pat Rapp, Pete Schourek, Scott Servais, Jeff Shaw, Bill Spiers, Ed Sprague, Kevin Tapani, Eddie Taubensee, Turner Ward, John Wehner, and Rick Wilkins.\nSteroid debate.\nPerformance-enhancing substances, which had made headlines in the sport for the past several years, became a factor in voting for the first time. Two MVP winners who later admitted to steroid use – José Canseco and Ken Caminiti – were both among the first-time candidates. More prominently, McGwire was appearing on the ballot for the first time; considered a highly likely first-ballot selection following his record-setting home run feats in the late 1990s, his candidacy was heavily debated more recently as observers of the sport considered both his admitted use of legal dietary supplements (particularly androstenedione, which he stopped using in 1998 and was banned in 2004), as well as suspicions in some quarters that he had also used steroids (which he ultimately admitted in 2010 to having used for much of his career, including 1998). The voters took these matters into consideration, individually determining how recent offensive totals should be regarded by the Hall, as the first players from the sport's offensive explosion in the late 1990s now began to appear on the ballot in significant numbers.\nIn November 2006, the Associated Press received responses from 125 baseball writers they had asked about their voting plans; about 3/4 of those who had decided were against electing McGwire, at least for the time being.\n\"New York Daily News\" sportswriter Bill Madden, who has also been part of the Veterans Committee selection process since 2003, said he will not vote for any player he even suspects of using steroids, citing the ballot guidelines which include a player's integrity as being among the five criteria voters should consider: \"I'm not voting for any of those guys – Bonds, McGwire, Sosa, Palmeiro, any of them. I draw the line at eyeball evidence and what I personally believe. I had three Hall of Famers come up to me at Cooperstown ... and they all said the same thing, 'We're looking to you guys to uphold the integrity of this place.'\" He added, \"If the Hall of Fame doesn't want me or any other writers to take a stand, then take that clause out of the ballot. I plan to invoke that clause.\"\n\"USA Today\" writer Bob Nightengale stated that even proof of steroid use would not cause him to withhold his vote, noting, \"So many other guys were taking them, including pitchers. So it's almost like a level playing field ... everybody was allowed to cheat, you still choose the best of that particular era.\" He nonetheless indicated that he would likely withhold his vote from McGwire for at least a year or two, saying, \"The biggest trouble I have with McGwire, he hit so many home runs in such a short period of time. It's not like he was a consistent Hall of Famer his whole career.\"\nIn contrast, Tony La Russa – McGwire's manager for all but one and a half years of his 16-season career – has said, \"Without question, I believe he belongs there on the first ballot. You're talking about a long and distinguished career.\" (McGwire was indeed an All-Star in all but two seasons from 1987 through 2000, and had already finished seventh or higher in the MVP voting three times before his 1998 record season.) La Russa also reiterated his belief that McGwire had never used steroids, saying, \"I know people are struggling with how to put it in perspective. I don't know where it goes. I don't know how people weigh. I don't know how the public feels. To me, the issue is the player that I saw for years and years. I believe in him. And that's where I leave it.\"\nMLB.com sportswriter Barry Bloom, noting that the supplements McGwire has admitted using were permitted in baseball at the time, stated that he would vote for McGwire and any other qualified candidate against whom there is no empirical evidence of steroid use, saying, \"They knew he was doing [androstenedione] and they didn't do anything at the time. Regardless of what happened since, I can't assume McGwire did anything.\"\nSt. Louis sportswriter Rob Rains said he will not vote for McGwire until he apologizes, saying, \"I want to hear that he's sorry for what he did. I still might not vote for him. But it would help.\".\"\nWriter and statistician John Thorn has cast a skeptical eye on writers who claim to be upholding a standard of integrity, observing that cheating for an advantage has always been a part of baseball, even among Hall of Famers such as Gaylord Perry and 19th-century star King Kelly: \"This whole thing about McGwire simply permits sportswriters to imagine themselves to be Woodward and Bernstein, people who see themselves as guardians of a sacred portal, the last best hope for truth and justice - and it's all hogwash and baloney.\"\nESPN sportswriter Jayson Stark, who stated that he would vote for McGwire, noting the earlier election of Perry, said, \"I think I'm stuck with evaluating what the sport allowed to happen on the field. Either the '90s happened or they didn't. Since they happened, and the hundreds of players using whatever they used leveled the playing field to some extent, I feel more comfortable voting for players like McGwire than I do trying to pick and choose who did what, and when, and why.\"\n\"Chicago Tribune\" writer Ron Rapoport stated, \"I'll vote for him. You can't rewrite the history of the game after the fact.\"\nHall of Famer Mike Schmidt offered his opinion in a commentary, saying of McGwire, \"The public wanted to see his giant biceps and long bombs, and could care less what he was putting in his milk. Now you want to vilify him because he doesn't want to own up, or admit, or even refute an involvement with steroids? Whoa! I'd ask the voters to look past the basic question -- did he or didn't he? -- and consider the era and what fueled it.\"\n\"Washington Post\" columnist Thomas Boswell, noted for his extensive writings on baseball, suggested that waiting a few years is the ideal solution, saying, \"Should we 'pardon' McGwire for accusations of steroid use that he has never actually admitted and for which no evidence exists?\" (In keeping with \"Post\" rules regarding writers voting on awards, Boswell previously gave up his BBWAA voting rights.) Observing that candidates initially have 15 years in which to be elected, Boswell added, \"McGwire's name will still be on the Hall of Fame ballot. But our perspective on him and the period in which he played may - for reasons we may not yet know - be far clearer than it is now.\"\nSome writers were sharply critical of McGwire for his remarks in Congressional hearings in March 2005, in which he stated: \"I will not participate in naming names and implicating my friends and teammates. Asking me, or any other player, to answer questions about who took steroids in front of television cameras will not solve this problem. If a player answers, 'No,' he simply will not be believed. If he answers, 'Yes,' he risks public scorn and endless government investigations.\" Many voters expressed concerns that his remarks constituted an implied confession. But Boswell defended McGwire's appearance, saying, \"He didn't make a non-confession confession. He simply said he refused to join a witch hunt. ... That's still a permissible position in America, right?\"\nSandy Alderson, general manager of the Oakland Athletics when McGwire starred for the team, and from 1998 to 2005 the executive vice president for baseball operations for Major League Baseball, has said he believes McGwire should be elected, adding that voters have a duty to bar steroid users; but he noted that \"it's not clear all the writers have to come up with the gold standard they're going to apply for all years.\" La Russa said, \"I can understand votes that are trying to send a message,\" but expressed his concern that \"I'm afraid that message is personal to a guy I think deserves the induction.\" All-Star second baseman Jeff Kent stated, \"I don't know where you draw the line,\" but added, \"I applaud the Hall of Fame voters for stressing over this, because it's worth it. Because it matters. And it should matter.\"\nThe day before the results were announced, Paul Ladewski of the Chicago-area \"Daily Southtown\" (now known as the \"SouthtownStar\") revealed that he had submitted a blank ballot (thus guaranteeing Gwynn and Ripken would not earn unanimous election), saying that he could not currently support any candidates who played primarily between 1993 and 2004, a period he termed the \"Steroids Era.\" He also added,\nAfter the results of the writers' balloting were announced, Stark was sharply critical of most of the writers who chose not to vote for Ripken or Gwynn, though he mildly defended Ladewski's decision. On Ripken, he noted:\nThe following day, Bill Shannon of Sports Press Service stated that he had not voted for Ripken or Gwynn, solely because he felt there were ten other worthy candidates who needed his vote more: \"I thought they were such obvious candidates they didn't need my vote. I wasn't thinking in terms of a 100 percent.\"\nAs for Gwynn, Stark added:\nLadewski responded,\nRegarding those who refused to vote for McGwire, \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" writer Bernie Miklasz stood by his vote for him, and criticized those he termed self-appointed \"morality police\": \"I saw what happened in 1998, I saw that it was good for the game, I saw the baseball establishment all approved of it, even though we all looked at McGwire and had some doubts about the source of his strength. I just don't believe a relatively short time later he should have to wear the scarlet letter.\"\nAnd Rick Hummel, who had earlier been announced as the year's recipient of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award, said in defense of his vote for McGwire, \"I don't have any evidence, and you are innocent until proven guilty. Are his stats worthy of the Hall? I think they are.\"\nBut some figures noted that McGwire's vote totals will likely increase with time, resulting in his eventual election. Pitcher Todd Jones wrote in his column in \"The Sporting News\" that failure to elect him would make the Hall look bad, rather than McGwire. Describing the voting writers as an angry mob, he agreed with McGwire's opinion that he would have drawn scorn and ridicule regardless of any testimony he had offered before Congress, and said, \"Now that mob thinks it is teaching him a lesson.\" And Hall of Famer Juan Marichal stated that McGwire belongs in the Hall on the basis of his home run total, and indicated that he will eventually be selected by the Veterans Committee if not by the writers, saying, \"Big Mac will be chosen for the Hall of Fame.\" However, the observers who said that McGwire's vote totals would increase with time have so far not been correct. McGwire's vote total has yet to increase beyond the 128 votes he received in this election; following his 2010 admission of steroid use, which came after the announcement of the 2010 election results, his support dropped from 128 that year to 115 in . McGwire's vote totals have continued to fall since then; he only received 63 votes in the most recent election in .\nVeterans Committee elections.\nRules enacted in August 2001 provided that the Veterans Committee would be expanded from its previous 15 members, elected to limited terms, to include the full living membership of the Hall, including recipients of the Ford C. Frick Award and J. G. Taylor Spink Award. Elections for players retired over 20 years would be held every other year, with elections of non-players (managers, umpires and executives) held every fourth year on a \"composite ballot\". No candidates were elected from either ballot in 2003, nor from the players' ballot in 2005, leading to criticism from the press and public that the voters were being too restrictive in evaluating candidates. The Committee voted in 2007 on players who were active no later than 1985. Candidates were eligible for the composite ballot if they had been retired from the sport for five years, or if they were at least 65 years of age and had been retired for at least six months.\nThe Committee voted on players again in preparation for the 2009 inductions, but that election was conducted under significantly different rules enacted in July 2007. The most important changes were:\nFor a more complete discussion of the changes, see the Veterans Committee article.\nThe Committee was scheduled to vote on non-players in 2011, but the July 2007 rules also dramatically affected the voting process for non-players. A 16-member panel of Hall of Famers, executives, and veteran media members voted on managers and umpires again prior to the 2008 inductions. A separate 12-member panel, drawn from the same sources as the managers/umpires panel but with a greater concentration of executives, simultaneously voted on executives. Both panels voted in the future for inductions in even-numbered years before further changes announced in 2010 that took effect with the 2011 elections.\nPreliminary phase.\nIn December 2005, a Historical Overview Committee of ten sportswriters appointed by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met at the Hall of Fame's library to develop a list of 200 former players who merited consideration for election but played no later than 1985, and a second list of 60 former managers, umpires and executives. They were provided with statistical information by the Elias Sports Bureau, official statistician for Major League Baseball since the 1920s, which also identified the 1,400 players with 10 or more years of play who were eligible.\nThe Historical Overview Committee comprised Dave Van Dyck (\"Chicago Tribune\"), Bob Elliott (\"Toronto Sun\"), Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau), Rick Hummel (\"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"), Moss Klein (Newark \"Star-Ledger\"), Bill Madden (\"New York Daily News\"), Ken Nigro (former \"Baltimore Sun\" writer), Jack O'Connell (BBWAA officer and writer for \"The Hartford Courant\"), Nick Peters (\"The Sacramento Bee\"), and Mark Whicker (\"Orange County Register\"). Their lists of 200 players and 60 other contributors were announced April 3, 2006.\nPlayers. († marks those newly eligible since 2005 (twelve).

As in previous years, the 200 players were almost evenly divided between players retired less than 50 years (98 players retired from 1957 to 1985) and those retired over 50 years (102 players retired 1956 or earlier).\nThe list of 200 was almost identical to the list prepared for the 2005 election; apart from the twelve players who were newly eligible, only three players from the 1910s were added: left fielder Sherry Magee, center fielder Clyde Milan, and pitcher Slim Sallee. Perhaps due to the reliance on \"official\" statistics – often incomplete in the sport's early years – provided by the Elias Sports Bureau, the committee included very few players from the sport's first half-century, which remains poorly represented in the Hall; only 14 players were included who made their debut before 1893 (one fewer than in 2005). Although the Hall's current membership includes fewer than a dozen non-pitchers of the 1870s and 1880s, compared to nearly 50 from the 1930s and 1940s, the committee included over 40 more players from the period between 1920 and 1945, but only 7 who played primarily in the 25 years before 1893: first baseman/outfielder Harry Stovey, shortstop Jack Glasscock, outfielder Pete Browning, and pitchers Charlie Buffinton, Bob Caruthers, Tony Mullane and Will White. For the third time, Will White was included even though his brother Deacon (who is to be inducted in ) is widely accepted as having been a far greater player. In addition to Deacon White, stars of the 19th century who were omitted included Paul Hines, Deacon McGuire, Cupid Childs, Bobby Lowe, George Gore, Hardy Richardson, Ezra Sutton, Arlie Latham, Fred Pfeffer and Joe Start.\nBy primary fielding position the nominees were starting pitchers (67), relief pitchers (10), catchers (10), first basemen (21), second basemen (5), third basemen (11), shortstops (18), left fielders (17), center fielders (22) and right fielders (19).\nOf the 15 players who were dropped from the 2005 list, nearly all were infielders (11) or pitchers (3), with Hank Sauer being the only outfielder; as had been true in earlier years, the list of preliminary candidates seemed to have been developed based on raw offensive totals, with less regard for defensive ability or considerations of era.\nContributors.

Davey Johnson, like Grimm, was dropped from the players' ballot after being included there in 2003 and 2005; evidently the review committee members regarded Johnson (age 63) as having been retired since 2000 even though he had managed the U.S. team in the 2005 Baseball World Cup, and served as a bench coach in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.\nSome people eligible for the first time but \"not\" nominated were umpires Larry Barnett, Jim Evans, Rich Garcia, Dave Phillips and Harry Wendelstedt, and managers Jim Fregosi, Tom Kelly and Johnny Oates (Fregosi was included on the players' list).\nPhase two.\nThe Historical Overview Committee nominations were forwarded to a 60-member BBWAA screening committee comprising two writers from each major league city. In summer 2006 they elected 25 players and 15 contributors who would appear on the final ballots. (Everyone voted for 25 and 15 candidates from the two preliminary ballots.) Meanwhile, a committee of six Hall of Fame members independently selected five of the 200 nominated players who would appear on the final ballot, so the final ballots would comprise 25 to 30 players and 15 contributors.\nEvidently the writers passed over two of the Hall of Fame members' five selections, for there were 27 on the final players ballot.\nFinal ballots.\nThe final ballots were announced on September 28, 2006. 23 of the 25 players on the 2005 ballot returned, with Lefty O'Doul, Cecil Travis, Mickey Vernon and one newly eligible player added as well, replacing Elston Howard and Smoky Joe Wood. Those selected played primarily from the 1950s onward, with only six of the candidates having retired before 1960, and only three – pitchers Carl Mays and Wes Ferrell, and left fielder/pitcher O'Doul – having retired before 1947. The BBWAA screening committee failed to include any candidates from the era before 1910. This likely reflected a tendency among the voting writers to vote only for those players they had seen themselves, and to withhold votes from earlier players.\nAll 61 living members of the Hall were eligible to cast ballots in the final election, along with the 8 living recipients of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award (including Jack Lang, who died on January 25 after voting had begun), the 14 living recipients of the Ford C. Frick Award, and the sole additional member of the pre-2001 Veterans Committee whose term had not yet expired (John McHale). Balloting was conducted by mail in January 2007, with voters permitted to vote for up to 10 candidates from each ballot; \"all\" candidates who received at least 75% of the vote would be elected. Results of the voting by the Veterans Committee were announced on February 27.\nThere were 84 eligible voters. 82 cast ballots in the players election, with 62 votes required for election; 81 cast ballots in the composite election, with 61 votes required for election. In all, 489 individual votes were cast on the players ballot, for an average of 5.96 votes per ballot, while 338 individual votes were cast on the composite ballot, an average of 4.17 votes per ballot. For the third consecutive Veterans Committee election, no one was elected. Of the 23 players who were also on the 2005 ballot, 14 received fewer votes in 2007, with only Jim Kaat (9), Don Newcombe (9), Maury Wills (7) and Ron Santo (5) increasing their totals by at least five votes. The 27 candidates on the players' ballot, with one player newly eligible since 2005 indicated with a † and candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections indicated in \"italics\", were:\nThere were 15 candidates on the composite ballot, all of whom had been previously eligible. Again reflecting an emphasis on recent figures, all 15 were active in the sport in 1976 or later. The candidates, with the ten executives designated (E), the four managers designated (M) and the sole umpire designated (U), and those who have since been selected in subsequent elections indicated in \"italics\", were:\nReaction.\nFollowing the third consecutive election in which there were no selections, and with only minimal gains by individual candidates over that period, Hall of Fame chairwoman Jane Forbes Clark suggested that the Hall's board of directors might make changes in the process before the next scheduled election in 2009, saying, \"We are disappointed that no one has been elected in the three voting cycles. We will be evaluating this process and its trends at our next meeting, which is March 13, and discussing whether there should be any changes.\" She added, \"The board may decide that the trends are not what we thought they were going to be. Perhaps this hasn't worked as well as some of the board members thought it would and maybe it needs a little bit of change.\" The board took no action at its March meeting, opting to continue discussions before its next meeting during induction weekend in July.\nHall of Fame member and vice chairman Joe Morgan tried to deflect criticism, saying, \"We're being blamed because something hasn't happened. If you're asking me, 'Do we lower our standards to get more people in?' my answer would be no.\" Noting that he voted for the maximum 10 players, he added, \"I feel there are some guys out there that belong in the Hall of Fame,\" but also said, \"The writers voted on these people for 15 years and they weren't elected. Why are we being criticized because we haven't elected someone?\"\nJoe Torre, who received less than half the required number of votes (but was later elected in his first year of eligibility as a manager), expressed disappointment that no one was selected and said, \"I'm not exactly sure what process they use. Don't forget, you've got the old guard and the young guard. People with different interests.\"\nAnd Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt noted his support for Jim Kaat and observed that other members also had \"their guys,\" admitting, \"Maybe that is the problem when you are trying to evaluate 'bubble' players on entrance. The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.\"\nTwo months after the results were announced, Commissioner Bud Selig expressed puzzlement that figures such as Ron Santo had not been elected, and indicated that after three unsuccessful elections he now favored a revision in the voting method. Coincidentally or not, the aforementioned rules changes for the Veterans Committee election process were announced almost exactly three months after Selig's remarks.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nRick Hummel received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. (The award was voted at the December 2006 meeting of the BBWAA, dated 2006, and conferred in the summer 2007 ceremonies.)\nThe Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame writers\" or words to that effect. Living recipients were members of the Veterans Committee for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\nThree final candidates, selected by a BBWAA committee, were named on July 11, 2006, in Pittsburgh in conjunction with All-Star Game activities: Rick Hummel of the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", Nick Peters of \"The Sacramento Bee\", and Morris Siegel, a writer for four Washington, D.C. newspapers. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to cast ballots in voting conducted by mail in November.\nOn December 6 at baseball's winter meetings, Rick Hummel was announced as the recipient , having received 233 votes out of the 411 ballots cast, with Siegel receiving 112 votes and Peters receiving 66 .\nFord C. Frick Award.\nDenny Matthews received the Ford C. Frick Award honoring a baseball broadcaster.\nThe Frick Award has been presented at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1978. It recognizes a broadcaster for \"major contributions to baseball\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame broadcaster\" or words to that effect. Living honorees were members of the Veterans Committee for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\nTo be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two; 195 candidates were eligible.\nOn December 5, 2006, the ten finalists were announced. In accordance with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a research committee at the museum: Tom Cheek, Dizzy Dean, Tony Kubek, France Laux, Denny Matthews, Graham McNamee and Dave Niehaus. Three additional candidates – Ken Harrelson, Bill King, and Joe Nuxhall – were selected through results of voting by fans conducted throughout November at the Hall's official website; more than 75,000 votes were cast .\nOn February 22, Denny Matthews was announced as the 2007 recipient ; a broadcaster of Kansas City Royals games since the franchise was established in 1969, he was selected in a January vote by a committee composed of the 14 living recipients, along with six additional broadcasting historians or columnists: Bob Costas (NBC), Barry Horn (\"The Dallas Morning News\"), Stan Isaacs (formerly of New York \"Newsday\"), Ted Patterson (historian), Curt Smith (historian) and Larry Stewart (\"Los Angeles Times\"). The committee members voted by mail, and based the selection on the following criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans."

India have won it twice in 1983 and 2011 while also finishing as runners-up in 2003 and 2023.\nOverall record.\n\"Red box indicates that the tournament was hosted or co-hosted by India\"\n1975 World Cup.\nThe 1975 Cricket World Cup was held in England in June 1975 and was the inaugural tournament. The format consisted of a group stage, in which each team played the other three teams in its group of four with India placed in Group B with England, New Zealand and East Africa. The Indian team was led by Srinivas Venkataraghavan and was relatively inexperienced at ODI cricket, having played their first match only a year earlier during the tour of England in 1974.\nIndia's first match was against England at Lord's where India scored 132/3 in 60 overs while chasing a score of 334, losing by 202 runs. India won the next match against East Africa at Headingley in Leeds by ten wickets, while chasing a modest target of 121 runs with medium pacer Madan Lal taking three wickets and Gavaskar top-scoring with 65 from 86 balls.

The format remained the same as the last edition and consisted of a group stage, in which each team played the other three teams in its group of four with India placed in Group B with West Indies, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. The Indian team was led by Srinivas Venkataraghavan for the second consecutive world cup.\nIndia's first match was against reigning world champions West Indies at Edgbaston in Birmingham which the West Indies won by nine wickets. India were bowled out for 190 with Vishwanath top scoring with 75 runs while Gordon Greenidge scored an unbeaten century for the West Indies. In their next match against New Zealand at Headingley, India were all out for 182 with Gavaskar top scoring with 55 runs and New Zealand chased the target to win by eight wickets with Bruce Edgar scoring an unbeaten 84.

Mohinder Amarnath was awarded the Man of the Match award in both the semi-finals and finals. Roger Binny finished as the highest wicket taker in the tournament with 18 wickets. India's upset victory in 1983 was a major turning point for Indian as well as world cricket as the win increased the popularity of cricket in India, leading to increased audience and revenues.\n1987 World Cup.\nThe 1987 Cricket World Cup was the first tournament to be held outside England and was co-hosted by India and Pakistan. The format remained the same as the last edition but the matches were reduced to 50 overs-a-side from 60 overs used in the earlier tournaments.

A new format was introduced for the 1992 World Cup, with the group format being scrapped in favour of a round-robin format, where each team would play all the other 8 teams in the tournament once, with the top 4 teams at the end of the Round-Robin stage progressing to the semifinals. It was also the first World Cup played with colored jerseys and which had day-night matches.\nIndia's first match in the tournament was against England at Perth which they lost by nine runs after being bowled out for 227 while chasing a target of 237. The second match against Sri Lanka at Mackay was abandoned due to rain after just two balls. Srikkanth holds the unusual record of scoring the only run ever scored in international cricket at the Ray Mitchell Oval, in Mackay as the ground did not host any other international matches. In the third match against co-hosts and defending champions Australia at The Gabba in Brisbane, India lost by one run in a repeat of the result from the previous World Cup. Chasing a revised target of 235 in a rain affected match, India were all out for 234 with Azharuddin top scoring with 93 runs.

In the semifinals at the Eden Gardens in Calcutta on 13 March 1996, India played Sri Lanka in a match which became notorious for poor crowd behavior. India asked Sri Lanka to bat first, who posted a total of 251/8 and in reply, India who were at one stage at 98/1, lost seven wickets for 22 runs to slump to 120/8 in the 35th over, with still 132 runs to win. At this point, sections of the crowd began rioting because of which the match referee Clive Lloyd decided to award the game to Sri Lanka. Tendulkar scored 523 runs at an average of 87.16 and was the leading run scorer in the tournament. Leg-spinner Kumble was the leading wicket taker in the tournament with 15 wickets at 18.73 apiece.\n1999 World Cup.\nThe 1999 Cricket World Cup was held in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Netherlands.

        "text": "John Emmett Brady (born September 17, 1954) is an American college basketball coach and the former head men's basketball coach at Arkansas State University.\nBrady was previously the head men's basketball coach at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. On February 8, 2008, LSU dismissed Brady, and named his assistant coach, Butch Pierre, the interim head coach for the remainder of the season. On March 21, 2008 John Brady was named the 15th head basketball coach at Arkansas State University.\nBrady had coached the Tigers to an unlikely Final Four run in the 2006 NCAA tournament, the fourth men's Final Four in LSU history.\nEarly life and education.\nBrady was born in McComb, Mississippi, about south of Jackson. He earned his BS from Belhaven College in 1976, where he played varsity basketball. He then received his master's in Education from Mississippi State University in 1977.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nAfter a year as a graduate assistant at Mississippi State, Brady began coaching in the high school ranks of Louisiana. In 1981 Brady was named the Louisiana Sports Writers Association Class AAA \"Coach of the Year.\" After returning to MSU to serve eight years as an assistant under Bob Boyd and Richard Williams, Brady was named head coach at Samford University in 1992. At the time of his departure, Brady was the winningest coach in Samford history, garnering an 89–77 record in six seasons.\nLSU.\nIn 1997, Brady replaced the legendary Dale Brown as head coach at LSU. When Brady arrived, the program was under probation and stinging from a recruiting scandal. Brady's first two years were rough.\nIn 2000 the Tigers broke through, posting a 28–6 record and an NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 appearance. However, due to the loss of Stromile Swift and Jabari Smith to the 2000 NBA draft, the Tigers could not carry their momentum to the next year, going 13–16 in 2001.\nBrady's team entered the 2005–06 season unranked, but were coming off a solid season in which they went 20–10 and made the NCAA tournament. Led by Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis and Tyrus Thomas, the Tigers won their first outright SEC regular season championship since 1985, and earned a #4 seed in the NCAA tournament. After wins over Iona and Texas A&amp;M, LSU defeated the #1 seed Duke and #2 seed Texas to make it to their first Final Four since 1986. Set at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana, the 2006 Final Four was the first since 1980 to feature no #1 seeds (LSU, #2 UCLA, #3 Florida and #11 George Mason). Facing the #2 seed Bruins in the national semifinals, the Tigers were unable to solve UCLA's defense, losing 59–45, dropping LSU to 0–6 all-time in the men's Final Four (and 0–10 in all Final Four games, including an 0–4 mark in the women's Final Four). Despite the loss, the 2005–06 season will be remembered as one of the most successful in LSU men's basketball history. John Brady was fired in the middle of his 11th season as LSU's head basketball coach and just two seasons after the Tigers' latest Final Four appearance.\nIn 10 seasons at LSU, Brady compiled a 184–126 record, including two SEC Regular Season Titles and four NCAA tournament appearances.\nOn February 8, 2008, Brady was fired from LSU. Earlier news reports stated that he would coach the Tennessee game on February 9, but LSU officials stated that his termination was immediate. Brady's assistant coach, Butch Pierre, took over as the interim head coach.\nBrady is now the color commentator for radio broadcasts of LSU games.\nArkansas State.\nOn March 18, 2008, Brady was hired by Arkansas State as head basketball coach.\nBrady won two division titles in the Sun Belt while the Red Wolves' coach, but was unable to ever get his team to the postseason and he announced at the beginning of the 2015–16 season that he would resign as coach, effective at the end of the season.\nBroadcasting career.\nBrady became the LSU Tigers basketball color analyst starting in the 2017–2018 season."

Its distance was the second longest of the individual event distances. Each nation could enter up to 12 cyclists.\nCompetition format.\nThe 20 kilometres in 1908 was a unique race in Olympic history. It was in some ways like a very long sprint but with elements of a points race. Each race consisted of slightly over 33 laps of the 660 yard track. The time limit for the race was 40 minutes. The competition was held in two rounds (semifinals and a final). There were 6 semifinals.

        "title": "Archery at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Men's double York round",
        "text": "The men's double York round was one of three archery events on the archery at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme. Arrows were shot in ends, or groups, of three. The archers shot a total of 288 arrows each over the two rounds of 144. The competition was held on Friday, 17 July and Saturday, 18 July, with one round each day. The archers had to contend with significant rain and wind on the first day and gusts of wind on the second.\nWilliam Dod won the competition to best his sister Lottie Dod's result; she won the silver medal in the women's competition. Dod's victory was \"pretty clear\" by the end of the 80-yard portion of the second round, with him having established a significant lead with only 24 arrows left at 60 yards. The United States' only archer won a bronze medal in this competition, preventing Great Britain from sweeping this event as they did the women's competition and France did the Continental-style event. Henry B. Richardson had the best single-round score of the competition (417 in the second round) but had been well behind the leaders after the first round. Despite starting the second day 50 points behind Reginald Brooks-King, Richardson nearly caught the other man for second place with 3 arrows remaining (down only 1 point, 749 to 748) before Brooks-King pulled away again on the last end, 19–12, for a \"close and exciting finish.\" Ten French archers competed in the York round, though none did better than 16th place.\nTwenty-seven archers from three nations competed. Five additional archers (4 from France, 1 from the United States) entered but did not start. NOCs were limited to 30 competitors each, though none came close to this maximum.\nBackground.\nThis was the second and final appearance of the event, which was previously held in 1904.\nDod was not favoured. Reginald Brooks-King had won five British national titles since 1900 (1900, 1902, 1903, 1906, and 1908), with John Penrose, John Bridges, Eyre Hussey (not competing at the London Games), and Hugh Nesham each taking one of the remaining four.\nCompetition format.\nEach round consisted of 72 arrows at , 48 arrows at , and 24 arrows at . Three arrows were shot per end. Each hit was worth 9, 7, 5, 3, or 1 points depending on which ring was hit; an arrow touching two rings would count as hitting the higher value. Ties were broken first by number of hits, then by score at the longest range (100 yards), then by hits at the longest range.\nSchedule.\nThe double York round event was held on the first two days of the archery schedule, along with the women's double National round."

NOCs were limited to 30 competitors each, though none came close to this maximum.\nJust as the British dominated the York round archery, the French dominated the Continental-style. The one Briton to formally enter placed 12th, while the American placed 15th. However, \"several\" of the British archers who had competed in the double York round event also joined in the shooting for this event without competing for medals. One, Robert Backhouse, shot a score of 260. He received a Diploma of Merit for the accomplishment, which would have earned a silver medal had he been shooting in competition.\nLouis Vernet and Henri Berton each hit the target with all 40 arrows. Eugène Grisot, Gustave Cabaret, Charles Aubras, and Louis Salingre each missed only once.\nCompetition format.\nEach archer shot 40 arrows, with the target 50 metres distant. Arrows were shot singly. Each hit was worth 9, 7, 5, 3, or 1 points depending on which ring was hit; an arrow touching two rings would count as hitting the higher value. Ties were broken first by number of hits, then by number of golds (hits in the 9-point ring)."

The competition was held on Friday, 17 July and Saturday, 18 July, with one round each day. The archers had to contend with significant rain and wind on the first day and gusts of wind on the second.\nGreat Britain was the only nation to enter female archers, ensuring that they swept this event. Queenie Newall, at 53 years of age, set a record for oldest female Olympic gold medalist. Lottie Dod took second place, not quite matching her brother William Dod's gold medal finish in the men's York round. Beatrice Hill-Lowe took bronze.\nNOCs were limited to 30 competitors each. Twenty-five archers only from Great Britain competed.\nBackground.\nThis was the second and final appearance of the event; it was previously held in 1904.\nAlice Legh won 23 national championships from 1886 to 1922 and \"almost certainly would have won\" this event had she competed; she chose not to. Among the archers who did compete, Lottie Dod was the most accomplished sportswoman, though she was best known for playing tennis. Dod had retired from tennis in 1893 and had successful careers in field hockey and golf before turning to archery in the Olympics.\nCompetition format.\nThe archers shot a total of 144 arrows each over the two rounds of 72. Each round consisted of 48 arrows at 60 yards (54.8 m) and 24 arrows at 50 yards (45.7 m). Three arrows were shot per end.

Dod and Newall had each hit 66 targets out of 72; Dod had a slight lead of 348 to 338. Newall was the best archer on day two, having the best round of the tournament with 350. Dod's second day was much worse, however, as she scored only 294 (the sixth-best score of the day). This gave Newall the gold medal, while Dod was able to hang on to second place. Hill-Lowe scored 343 on the second day, a vast improvement over her 275 first-day score and second-best behind Newall, to earn the bronze medal.\nAftermath.\nNewall would be defeated by Legh by 151 points the next week at the British national championships, though Newall would go on to win in 1911 and 1912.\nWomen's archery would not be held again until 1972. (Archery was not held in 1912, only men's events were held in 1920, and the sport was absent from the programme from 1924 to 1968.)"

Diaz was selected to receive the Futch–Condon Award for the 1999 Trainer of the Year by the Boxing Writers Association of America, and was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame on November 15, 2008.\nDiaz began boxing when he was eight years old, and experienced twenty-seven amateur outings, but had a very short career as a professional boxer, having only one fight and then retired from boxing as a fighter.\nDiaz moved to Los Angeles, California, where he established the Miguel Diaz boxing gym. One of his first world champions was Pedro Decima. He also trained Erik Morales who knocked Daniel Zaragoza out in eleven rounds at El Paso, Texas for the WBC world Bantamweight championship. Diaz then began traveling between Los Angeles and Tijuana to help train Morales. Miguel Diaz also worked as a cutman/co-trainer for Diego 'Chico' Corrales and Floyd 'Money' Mayweather. This created a conflict when they fought. Rather than stay with Mayweather, whom he had a longer relationship with he decided to work Corrales' corner. Mayweather was professional but let Diaz know he wouldn't work with Diaz again if he made this decision. Diaz was confident in Corrales' victory, had a bigger role with Corrales, and was getting a larger percentage of the fighters purse for working in this capacity. Mayweather dominated the fight and won. Since then Miguel Diaz no longer worked with Corrales nor Mayweather. This resulted in millions of dollars of lost income as Mayweather went on to be one of the highest-grossing fighters in boxing history.\nHe went on to help train Fernando Vargas for a number of fights and established a second Miguel Diaz boxing gym, located in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nDiaz later resided part-time in Puerto Rico, where he helped train brothers Miguel Angel and José Miguel Cotto as well as Daniel Jimenez, among others. Miguel Cotto reached world championship status, winning the WBO Junior Welterweight crown and later was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. He also coached Marcos Maidana."

It was the final ranking event of the 2002–03 snooker season. This was the 27th consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship had been held at the Crucible, marking the 26th anniversary of the first staging of the event at this venue. The championships were sponsored by cigarette manufacturer Embassy.\nMark Williams won his second World Championship title by defeating Ken Doherty 18–16 in the final. Having won the UK Championship and the Masters earlier in the season, Williams held all three Triple Crown titles simultaneously. The defending champion, Peter Ebdon, lost 12–13 to Paul Hunter in the quarter-finals and became another first-time champion to fall to the Crucible curse by failing to defend his first world title. A total prize fund of £1,682,900 was awarded at the event, with the winner receiving £270,000.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the sport was popular in the British Isles. However, in the modern era it has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nThe championship featured 32 professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single elimination format, each played over several . The 32 competitors in the main tournament were selected using a combination of the top players in the world snooker rankings and a pre-tournament qualification stage. Joe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, the final match being held in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held in the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England.\nFormat.\nThe championship was held from 19 April and 5 May 2003 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, the 27th consecutive time that the tournament was held at the venue. It was the ninth and last ranking event of the 2002–03 snooker season on the World Snooker Tour. There were a total of 120 entrants from the tour, and the competition's main draw had 32 participants.\nThe top 16 players in the latest world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. As defending champion, Peter Ebdon was seeded first for the event, with world number 1 Ronnie O'Sullivan seeded 2; the remaining seeds were allocated based on the players' world ranking positions. Matches in the first round of the main draw were played as best-of-19-frames. The number of frames needed to win a match increased to 13 in the second round and quarter-finals, and 17 in the semi-finals; the final match was played as best-of-35-frames.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nFirst round.\nThe opening round was played from 19 to 24 April as the best-of-19 frames, held over two sessions. Ronnie O'Sullivan compiled a maximum break in his first-round match against Marco Fu, making him the first player to have scored two 147s at the venue. This was the fifth maximum compiled at the world championships; the first since O'Sullivan at the 1997 World Championship. However, Fu won the match 10–6. Stephen Hendry made a 132 break in his first round match against Gary Wilkinson, and became the first player to compile 100 century breaks at the Crucible. Hendry won the match 10–7.\nThe number one seed Peter Ebdon won the opening match of the event, with a 10–3 victory over Gerard Greene. Ebdon lead 4–3 but then won six frames in a row to win. Ebdon thanked stronger contact lenses for his ability to stay in the match. Ken Doherty led qualifier Shaun Murphy 8–4, but Murphy won four frames to tie the match at 8–8. The next two frames were tied, sending the match to a , which was won on the final by Doherty.\nSecond round.\nThe second round was played from 24 to 28 April as the best-of-25 frames, held over three sessions. Mark Williams lost the opening two frames of his second-round match against Quinten Hann before winning 13 in a row – a record for a single match in the modern era of snooker – to triumph 13–2. Matthew Stevens played Paul Hunter, with Hunter compiling the 750th century at the Crucible in frame four. He led 12–4 after two sessions, and won 13–6. Ken Doherty had a second deciding frame in two matches as he defeated Graeme Dott. Doherty was 2–7 behind, but won 9 of the next 11 frames to lead 11–9. With the scores tied at 12–12, Doherty won a 42-minute final frame. In an all Scottish clash, Stephen Hendry defeated Drew Henry 13–10 from 9–10 behind.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-final was played on 29 and 30 April as the best-of-25 frames played over three sessions. Paul Hunter defeated the defending champion Peter Ebdon in a deciding frame 13–12. The pair were tied 8–8 after the first two sessions, with Ebdon leading 10–9 after breaks of 76 and 109. Hunter won the next three frames with breaks of 55, 106 and 71 to be one frame from victory. Ebdon won the next two frames to tie the match 12–12 before Hunter won the decider. Having not reached a single final during his year as champion, Ebdon commented that \"it has been a disappointing season\", whilst Hunter perhaps drew on his two Masters finals wins to motivate him in the deciding frame.\nIn his match against John Higgins, Ken Doherty won the first ten frames, before Higgins took the next seven. In seeing his lead shrink, Doherty referred to it as the \"biggest collapse since Wall Street in the 20s\". Doherty eventually won the match 13–8. Mark Williams defeated seven-time champion and close friend Stephen Hendry 13–7. Stephen Lee and Marco Fu were tied at 4–4 after the first session of their match, but Lee won the next five frames to lead 9–4 and eventually won 13–7.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played between 1 and 3 May, as the best-of-33 frames, held over four sessions. In the first semi-final, Ken Doherty trailed Paul Hunter 9–15 at the start of the final session with Hunter only requiring two more frames for victory. Doherty won five in a row to reduce the deficit to a single frame. Hunter took frame 30 to lead 16–14, but Doherty won all three remaining frames to win the match 17–16. After the match, Hunter commented that he was \"devastated\" by the result. A condensed version of the match was showcased on BBC Two on 28 April 2020 in place of the 2020 World Snooker Championship which was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe other semi-final was played between Mark Williams and Stephen Lee. Williams took an early 7–1 lead after the first session, but Lee won five of the eight frames in the second session to trail 10–6. Williams won the opening four frames of the third session, and lead 16–8 leading into the final session, and won the remaining frame to win 17–8. After the match, Lee called Williams \"dangerous\", whilst Williams suggested the opening session was when the match was won.\nFinal.\nThe final was held on 4 and 5 May between Ken Doherty and Mark Williams as a best-of-35 frames match. The final was officiated by the Netherlands' Jan Verhaas, the youngest referee at a world final. Williams took an early lead in the final, leading at 6–2 after the first session, and extended the lead to 10–2 in the second session. Doherty won three of the remaining four frames in the session to leave Williams with an 11–5 lead overnight. On the resumption in the third session, Doherty won six frames in-a-row to tie the match at 11–11. The pair shared the next six frames with the scores tied at 14–14, before Williams won the next two frames to lead 16–14. Doherty won the next two, before Williams won frame 33 and then frame 34 with a break of 77 to win the match 18–16.\nThe win was Williams' second world championship, having won the title in 2000. In winning the event, Williams completed the Triple Crown, having also won the UK Championship and Masters in the season. He was only the third player to win these three events in a single season and is the most recent player to have achieved this. The win allowed Williams to become world number one again, the first player to regain the position under the current ranking system and only the second overall after Ray Reardon. Williams had only lost 19 frames through the first four rounds, winning 53. With three of his matches going to a deciding frame, Doherty played 132 out of a possible 137 frames in the tournament, a record for the modern era, with only his quarter final win over Higgins having been decided by more than two frames.\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for each round. The numbers in brackets represents players seeding, whilst those in bold denote match winners.\nCentury breaks.\nThere were 53 century breaks made in the tournament. The highest break was a maximum break of 147 made by Ronnie O'Sullivan in the opening round."

        "text": "The men's 100 kilometres was one of seven track cycling events on the Cycling at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme. Its distance was the longest of the individual event distances. A challenge cup was presented by the Prince of Wales to the winner. There were 43 competitors from 11 nations. Each nation could enter up to 12 cyclists. The event was won by Charles Henry Bartlett of Great Britain, with his countryman Charles Denny finishing second. Octave Lapize earned bronze, making France the only nation to have medalists at both appearances of the 100 kilometres race (Léon Flameng won in 1896).\nBackground.\nFrom 1896 to 1924 (excluding 1912, when no track events were held), the track cycling programme included events at a variety of distances that changed from Games to Games and ranged from the -mile to the 100 kilometres (and, even longer, the unique 12 hours race in 1896 that saw finishers exceed 300 kilometres). The 100 kilometres was held twice: in 1896 and again in 1908. The favorite in 1908 was Leon Meredith of Great Britain, who had won the world championship in 1904, 1905, and 1907 (and would win again in 1908, 1909, 1911, and 1913).\nFrance, Germany, Great Britain, and Greece made their second appearance in the event, having competed previously in 1896 (along with Austria). Belgium, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden, and the United States made their only appearance in 1908.\nCompetition format.\nThe 100 kilometres race was conducted in two rounds, semifinals and a final. Each race was approximately 165.7 laps of the 660 yard track. The time limit for the race was 3 hours and 15 minutes. There were two semifinals. The first 6 cyclists to finish, and the 2 cyclists who led for the most laps, in each semifinal advanced to the final.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nSemifinal 1.\nLutz and Hansson broke away to a 300 yard lead at lap 76. Bailey caught them shortly after the halfway mark. The three lapped the field at lap 96. Santorinaios retired at lap 96, McCarthy at lap 103, and Katzer a few minutes later. Lutz tried to break away from the group, but Hansson and Bailey stayed with him. The finish was a sprint among the top three, with Hansson making an inside move with half a lap to go and winning by half a wheel over Lutz. Bailey was two lengths behind.\nSemifinal 2.\nCunault and Madelaine were lapped at five miles, with Cunault retiring shortly after. Madelaine fell at lap 44 and needed an ambulance. Avrillon, leading for stretches, retired shortly after; along with the other non-finishers to that point, there were only 15 cyclists left of the 26 starters. A crash a little after the one-hour mark eliminated Noon and Weintz, with Meredith falling but able to resume the race. After an hour and a half, Coeckelberg crashed into an athletics judge who had wandered onto the track, hitting his head on the concrete curb and sustaining cuts on his thigh and head; he was able to continue, however. Zanzottera retired at lap 60 with cramps, and Parini retired shortly after. It started to rain two hours into the race, continuing for half an hour; only nine men remained at the end of it. Seven of them finished together, with Coeckelberg 100 yards behind at the end.\nIt is not clear how Young advanced to the final; the Official Report says in the results of this heat that Coeckelberg and Denny qualified as having led the most laps, and in the description of the final field says that Young was \"permitted to start, having satisfied the judges that he was not lapped in Heat 2.\"\nFinal.\nIt had rained before the start of the final and continued raining for most of the race. Meredith, Andrews, and Robertson crashed at 13 miles; they all continued but Meredith was behind the field and was lapped at lap 62, after which he retired. Bailey led at the halfway mark, but was lapped with 31 laps to go. The lead pack dwindled to seven riders at lap 115 and was down to four at the final lap. Three were British, allowing them to use teamwork to pace Bartlett for the final sprint. Denny led going into the final lap, with Lapize on the outside. Bartlett came down from the banking and sprinted to the finish, crossing the line a wheel ahead of Denny."

The quarter-final match-ups were determined by a draw including the AFC, CAF, CONCACAF and OFC champions, while the UEFA and CONMEBOL champions were given byes to the semi-finals. The losers of the quarter-finals would play for the fifth place, while the losers of the semi-finals were to play in a third-place play-off.\nDefending champions São Paulo were beaten in the 2006 Copa Libertadores Finals by fellow Brazilian side Internacional, who went on to win the Club World Cup for the first time, beating Al Ahly in the semi-finals before defeating Spanish club Barcelona 1–0 in the final.\nA team from the host nation did not participate, as was initially proposed. Following the departure of Australia from the OFC, the Oceanian representative, Auckland City, was fully amateur, so forcing them to play a play-off for a place in the quarter-finals against the J.

        "title": "World Series Formula V8 3.5",
        "text": "The World Series Formula V8 3.5, formerly the World Series by Nissan from 1998 to 2004, the Formula Renault 3.5 Series from 2005 to 2015 and the Formula V8 3.5 in 2016 and 2017, was a motor racing series promoted by RPM Racing (1998–2004) and Renault Sport (2005–2015).\nHistory.\nThe series came out of the Spanish Formula Renault Championship, which ran from 1991 to 1997. The World Series was founded as \"Open Fortuna by Nissan\" in 1998, and was mostly based in Spain, but visited other countries throughout its history, including France, Italy, Portugal and Brazil. The organization was handled by RPM Comunicacion, founded by Jaime Alguersuari Tortajada. The series changed name a number of times, usually adopting the name of its main sponsor, but was also known by other common names such as the unofficial \"Formula Nissan\".\nIn its early years, the series used chassis built by Coloni, with a 2.0 L Nissan SR20 engine. The series slotted in between Formula Three and Formula 3000. In 2002, it adopted a new format, with chassis supplied by Dallara and the engine upgraded to the VQ30. The series also became more international, with more than half of the race calendar held outside Spain.\nRenault started the Formula Renault V6 Eurocup in 2003, as a support series in Eurosport's Super Racing Weekends (European Touring Car Championship and FIA GT Championship). The series ran with Tatuus chassis and a Nissan 3.5 L V6 engine.\nIn 2005, Renault left the Super Racing Weekend and started the World Series by Renault and the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, merging both the World Series by Nissan (whose engine contract had finished) and Renault V6 Eurocup. The Dallara chassis was retained, while the Renault V6 was improved to 425 PS. Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup and the Eurocup Mégane Trophy also joined the series in 2005 to support the main FR3.5 series.\nAt the end of July 2015, Renault Sport announced it would be withdrawing its backing to the Formula Renault 3.5 from 2016 onwards, handing the control of the series to co-organiser RPM. However, Renault Sport also said it would continue the World Series by Renault with the Renault Sport Trophy and the Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup. As a result of this, RPM decided to change the series' name to Formula V8 3.5. In December 2016, the series' name was changed again to World Series Formula V8 3.5, giving extra recognition to the championship.\nOn 17 November 2017 was announced that due to lack of entries the series would not take place in 2018 with a possibility of relaunch in the near future.\nTechnical.\nFrom 2008 to 2011, the chassis for the Formula Renault 3.5 Series is the Dallara T08 and the engine a 3.5 litre V6 Nissan VQ35 unit producing 480 bhp with a rev limit of 8500 rpm. The gearbox is a 6 speed semi-automatic supplied by Ricardo with steering wheel paddle shift. Total weight of the car is 600 kg (dry).\nStarting from 2012 season, the Formula Renault 3.5 Series adopted a new chassis, the Dallara T12, powered by a 3.4 litre V8 engine producing 530 BHP at 9250 rpm developed by Zytek. The cars have 50 more horsepower than previous season and lost 15 kg (33 pounds) of weight. In addition, a Drag Reduction System is used, which operates in a similar way to the one in use in Formula One.\nChampions.\nWorld Series by Nissan.\nNOTE – 1998–2001, mainly Spanish-based series (also known as Formula Nissan) with 2.0L engine.\nNOTE – 2002–2004, international series with V6 engine.\nNotable drivers.\nFormula One drivers in the future and/or past\nChampions in other categories\nOther notable drivers\nTelevision broadcast.\nWorld Series by Renault races were broadcast live as part of a package of the combined open-wheel and touring car races on the pan-European Eurosport subscription channel or its sister stations Eurosport2 and British Eurosport. Eurosport is also on-sold to several non-European networks, extending World Series by Renault's international reach as far as South East Asia and Oceania. The races are also carried live by Estonia channel Kanal 12 and Spain channel Aragon TV. Abbreviated highlights packages were carried by several other television networks and stations, including the British channels Sky Sports and MotorsTV, the Dutch RTL 7 channel, ESPN Star Sports in Asia, Speed in South America and Esporte Interativo in Brazil."

        "title": "WrestleMania XXIV",
        "text": "WrestleMania XXIV was the 24th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on March 30, 2008, at the Florida Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Florida and was the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Florida. It was also the second WrestleMania to be held outdoors (the first was WrestleMania IX in April 1993). American socialite Kim Kardashian served as the hostess of the event.\nNine professional wrestling matches were scheduled for the event, which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. In the final match of the event, which was the main match from SmackDown, The Undertaker defeated Edge to win the World Heavyweight Championship. Raw's main match was a triple threat match, in which Randy Orton defeated Triple H and John Cena to retain the WWE Championship. The main match from the ECW brand was a singles match in which Kane defeated Chavo Guerrero to win the ECW Championship. From the six scheduled bouts on the undercard, three received more promotion than the others. In a No Disqualification match, professional boxer Floyd \"Money\" Mayweather defeated Big Show. The other featured undercard matches saw CM Punk win the inter-promotional Money in the Bank ladder match and a retirement match in which Shawn Michaels defeated Ric Flair, leading to Flair's departure from the WWE and a period of retirement from active wrestling.\nTickets for the event commenced sale to the public on November 3, 2007. WWE and the City of Orlando hosted festivities that spanned a five-day period within the central Florida region. For the second consecutive year, WrestleMania broke the record for the highest-grossing pay-per-view in WWE history. It also set a gate record for the Citrus Bowl, grossing US$5.85 million in ticket sales. According to a study by Enigma Research Corporation of Toronto, the Citrus Bowl's record-breaking attendance brought an estimated $51.5 million – surpassing the projected $25 million – into the local economy and generated $1.8 million in local tax revenue. The Central Florida Sports Commission reported that the event created jobs and brought approximately 60,000 visitors to the city. Over one million people ordered the event on pay-per-view, grossing $23.8 million in revenue. It was also the first WrestleMania PPV broadcast in high definition.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is considered World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". WrestleMania XXIV featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands.\nOn March 21, 2007, a press conference was held at City Hall in Orlando, Florida, formally announcing that WrestleMania XXIV would be held in Orlando at the Florida Citrus Bowl on March 30, 2008, which would be the first WrestleMania held in Florida. According to an interview with \"The Daytona Beach News-Journal\" at the press conference, WWE chairman Vince McMahon mentioned Orlando being one of three front-runners to host the event, the other two being Las Vegas and Paris. McMahon explained that Orlando was chosen as geographically, a WrestleMania was never held in the southeast before.\nAs the second WrestleMania to be held entirely outdoors (after WrestleMania IX), McMahon also announced that the event would have taken place regardless of the weather conditions. In the March 2008 issue of \"WWE Magazine\", WWE set designer Jason Robinson revealed that a steel rig with a tarpaulin roof would be built above the ring itself to prevent rain from falling on the ring; during the Money in the Bank ladder match, it rained briefly. In that same issue, an initial design of the ring setup was revealed showing a larger rig surrounding the tarpaulin rig, with lighting and two giant screens attached. The final design had the lighting and video screens on the tarpaulin rig, as well as the sound system. During an interview, WWE production manager Brian Petree mentioned that video reinforcement should prevent anyone's view from being obstructed by the steel structure. Up to seven generators were used to power up the event.\nThe set design for the entrance stage was at the north end of the stadium and consisted of another steel structure with various video screens hanging from it. The steel beams for the structure were custom built in Belgium and shipped over to Orlando. According to \"WWE Magazine\", the amount of pyrotechnics used would be ten times that of the amount used on \"Raw\". Without the restriction of a roof, the pyrotechnics for the show shot as high as as compared to WrestleMania 23's height of . The fireworks were set off from boats on one of the lakes nearby the stadium. WWE has been said to have spent an estimated $300,000 on the fireworks alone.\nWith the Citrus Bowl's locker rooms on the south side and the entrance set on the north side, a tented mini-city outside the north end served as the show's backstage area and included air conditioning, trailers, VIP areas, showers and restrooms. As a consequence, the road next to the north end zone, W. Church Street, was closed down until a day after the event. Numerous other roads were also closed to allow trucks and forklifts to move in mega equipment for the event. The ring itself was built on the 50-yard line of the Citrus Bowl to give the best view for fans. Heavy-duty plastic flooring had been put over the field, to protect the turf, provide seating, and serve as the steel structures' foundation.\nDevelopment on the set design began in the middle of 2007. The building of the actual set began in the middle of March 2008. 100 people worked 16 hours a day to construct the set for the event. The construction finished on March 29. WrestleMania XXIV was the first WrestleMania event to be filmed in high-definition. It was also the first WWE show and sports related title to be released on the Blu-ray Disc format by WWE Home Video. WrestleMania also led to an increase in sales for musical artists related to the event, including the Red Hot Chili Peppers' album \"Stadium Arcadium\", John Legend's album \"Live from Philadelphia\", Rev Theory's single \"Light It Up\", and Fuel's single \"Leave the Memories Alone\", which was used as part of a tribute to Ric Flair.\nStorylines.\nWrestleMania XXIV featured nine professional wrestling matches with wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or fan favorites as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. All wrestlers belonged to either the Raw, SmackDown, or ECW brand – storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs.\nThe predominant rivalry scripted into WrestleMania on the Raw brand was between Randy Orton, John Cena, and Triple H, over the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view event in January, Orton successfully defended the WWE Championship against Jeff Hardy and later that night, Cena returned from an injury and won the Royal Rumble match when he last eliminated Triple H. Instead of challenging Orton for the title at WrestleMania, Cena decided to challenge him at No Way Out, where Orton got himself intentionally disqualified by slapping the referee, thus retaining the WWE Championship. Later, Triple H also became a top contender to the WWE Championship by defeating five other men in an Elimination Chamber match. The next night on \"Raw\", Cena argued that he deserved another WWE Championship match. Raw general manager William Regal then announced that Cena would face Orton later in the night, where if Cena won, he would be added to the WrestleMania match between Triple H and Orton, making it a triple threat match. If Orton won, the main event would remain as Orton versus Triple H in a singles match. However, Cena won the match and was added to the bout at WrestleMania. After the match, Triple H, who was the special guest referee, executed a Pedigree on both Cena and Orton.\nThe predominant rivalry on the SmackDown brand was between Edge and The Undertaker, over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the February 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", assistant general manager Theodore Long announced that at No Way Out, an Elimination Chamber match would be held to determine the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania. The Undertaker won the match by last eliminating Batista. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Edge predicted that The Undertaker's 15–0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania would come to an end once he defeated him. Two weeks later on the March 7 episode of \"SmackDown\", the team of Edge and Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder defeated The Undertaker in a Handicap match after Edge pinned The Undertaker. The following week, La Familia (Chavo Guerrero, Edge, Hawkins and Ryder) defeated Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels in a steel cage match. During the match, Undertaker interfered and attacked La Familia. However, Edge escaped the cage to win the match for his team. Two weeks later on \"SmackDown\", Edge, along with Vickie Guerrero, Hawkins and Ryder, held a mock burial entitled \"Burial of The Undertaker's WrestleMania Undefeated Streak\", to celebrate Edge's early victory over The Undertaker. During the \"burial\", however, The Undertaker emerged from a casket, which was inside the ring, and attacked Edge, Hawkins, and Ryder, knocking Hawkins and Ryder outside the ring and chokeslamming Edge through the casket.\nAt No Way Out, Big Show made a return to the company after taking time off for injuries beginning in December 2006. In his return promotional interview, Big Show threatened to give Rey Mysterio a chokeslam. Professional boxer and WBC Welterweight Champion Floyd \"Money\" Mayweather, who was in attendance and a close friend of Mysterio's, came to his aid and confronted Big Show. After Big Show dropped to his knees, Mayweather attacked him with a combination of punches, which caused Big Show to bleed from the nose and mouth. The following night on \"Raw\", Big Show challenged Mayweather to a wrestling match, which Mayweather accepted. As part of the storyline, Big Show arranged an exhibition match with fighter Brandon Hill, who was similar in size and stature to Mayweather. Unimpressed with Big Show's display of dominance over Hill, Mayweather told Big Show that \"at WrestleMania, I'm going to break your jaw\". At their weigh-in for their WrestleMania match, Big Show threw Mayweather into a crowd of wrestlers to emphasise the disparity in size.\nOn the February 25 episode of \"Raw\", 2008 WWE Hall of Fame Inductee Ric Flair challenged Shawn Michaels to a match at WrestleMania. Michaels accepted after some reluctance, knowing that due to a previous announcement from WWE chairman Mr. McMahon the next match Flair lost would result in his forced retirement. Flair said that \"it would be an honor for [him] to retire at the hands of Shawn Michaels.\"\nOn February 18, WWE announced via its website that the fourth annual Money in the Bank ladder match would take place at WrestleMania XXIV, a match where the objective is to retrieve a briefcase suspended in the air using a ladder. The match involved wrestlers from all three WWE brands. The winner would earn a contract to challenge for any of the three WWE World Championships (the WWE Championship of Raw, the World Heavyweight Championship of SmackDown, or the ECW Championship of ECW) at any time and any place over a one-year period. Qualifying matches occurred to determine the participants in the match at WrestleMania, starting on that night's \"Raw\" with Jeff Hardy and Mr. Kennedy defeating Snitsky and Val Venis respectively to qualify. Shelton Benjamin became the third participant when he defeated Jimmy Wang Yang on the following episode of \"SmackDown\". During the next two weeks on \"Raw\", Chris Jericho defeated Hardy, and Carlito defeated Cody Rhodes to qualify. At a non-televised SmackDown/ECW house show held on March 8, Montel Vontavious Porter qualified when he defeated Jamie Noble. On the March 11 episode of \"ECW\", CM Punk became the seventh entrant when he defeated Big Daddy V. John Morrison was the final person to qualify when he beat The Miz on the March 14 episode of \"SmackDown\". Hardy was later removed from the match after a legitimate suspension by WWE for a drug violation of the company's Wellness Policy. WWE decided not to add another superstar in his place, making that year's Money in the Bank ladder match the first year to have seven participants.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nBefore the show aired live on pay-per-view, Kane won a 24-man Interpromotional Battle Royal, an elimination style match where the last person remaining was the winner, to win an ECW Championship match against Chavo Guerrero later that night. The event officially began with John Legend singing a rendition of \"America the Beautiful\".\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match was a Belfast Brawl between Finlay and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), a match in which there were no disqualifications or countouts and the match outcomes could have occurred anywhere. Finlay was accompanied to the ring by his storyline son, Hornswoggle, who was returning from a scripted injury suffered at the hands of JBL. During the match, JBL hit Finlay with a trash can lid when the latter was about to perform a suicide dive on him through the ropes on the outside. Later on, Finlay tossed JBL through a table that he had set up earlier on the turnbuckle. Hornswoggle also got involved during the match by hitting JBL with a kendo stick, while later on JBL threw a trash can at him. Attacking Finlay's knee with a kendo stick, JBL delivered a Clothesline from Hell to Finlay to score a successful pinfall. This was an interpromotional match.\nThe next match of the evening was the fourth-annual Money in the Bank ladder match, in which there were no disqualifications or countouts, and the only way to win the match was to climb a ladder in the ring and retrieve a contract briefcase hanging above. The match featured Chris Jericho, Mr. Kennedy, and Carlito from the Raw brand; CM Punk, Shelton Benjamin and John Morrison from the ECW brand; and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) from the SmackDown brand. Jeff Hardy was supposed to be in the match, but he violated the wellness program and was taken out of the match. Early in the match, Morrison climbed a turnbuckle and performed a moonsault onto other competitors outside the ring while holding a ladder against his chest. Later, while Kennedy and Morrison were battling on top of a ladder, Benjamin climbed another ladder placed adjacent to the first one and performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Kennedy, who in turn superplexed Morrison from the top of the ladder. Later, Carlito and Kennedy flipped Benjamin off a ladder in the ring, sending him crashing through another ladder set-up between the barricade and the ring apron. When MVP was close to retrieving the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy (returning to action after suffering a legitimate injury), entered the ring from the crowd, climbed the ladder, and delivered a Twist of Fate to MVP off that ladder. As soon as Morrison started to climb a ladder, see-sawing with another ladder, Jericho flipped the other one and Morrison landed on the ring-ropes groin-first. Jericho even performed a Codebreaker on Punk using a ladder. In the end, Jericho and Punk fought each other on a ladder, but Punk trapped Jericho's one leg in the ladder's steps and retrieved the briefcase to win the match. This was an interpromotional match.\nNext after that match, Howard Finkel introduced the 2008 WWE Hall of Fame class: Jack and Gerald Brisco, Gordon Solie (represented by his family), Rocky Johnson, High Chief Peter Maivia (represented by his wife Lia and daughter Ata), Eddie Graham (represented by his son Mike), Mae Young, and Ric Flair (represented by his family).\nThe next match, which was billed as a \"Battle for Brand Supremacy\", was between \"SmackDown's\" Batista and \"Raw's\" Umaga. Early in the match, both Batista and Umaga exchanged blows and Batista knocked Umaga outside with a shoulder block. Umaga later kicked Batista in the face, which caused him to fall back-first outside the ring from the ring-apron. As a result, Umaga started targeting Batista's injured back. In the end, however, when Umaga tried to perform his Samoan Spike, Batista countered the attempt and gave him a spinebuster. Batista won the match by pinning Umaga after a Batista Bomb.\nThe fourth match for the event featured Chavo Guerrero defending his ECW Championship against Kane. Kane surprised Chavo by emerging from underneath the ring instead of from the entrance stage during his ring entrance. Kane instantly pinned Chavo after a chokeslam and won the ECW Championship in eleven seconds.&lt;ref name=\"Guerrero/Kane\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only ECW match on the show and the only ECW Championship match in WrestleMania history.\nMain event matches.\nRic Flair's \"Career Threatening\" match against Shawn Michaels was next, which stipulated that Flair would have to retire from wrestling if he had lost. At the start of the match, both superstars engaged in a series of counters, and then Flair shoved Michaels in a corner, making \"Old Yeller\" comments to him. In retaliation, Michaels slapped Flair in the face, which caused him to start bleeding from the mouth. Later, Michaels attempted Sweet Chin Music, but stopped in the process and Flair capitalized by trapping him in his figure four leglock. Afterward, Michaels finally delivered the Sweet Chin Music to Flair for a near-fall. Michaels then trapped Flair in his modified figure four leglock, but Flair delivered a thumb to the eye to Michaels to break the submission. As Flair was delivering chops to Michaels' chest, Michaels executed a second Sweet Chin Music. After getting up on his feet with a worried face, Michaels said to Flair \"I'm sorry, I love you\", before nailing a final Sweet Chin Music and thus pinning Flair to end his 35-year-long wrestling career. After the match, Michaels left quickly and Flair got a standing ovation from the crowd. An emotional Flair embraced his family at ringside and then, as he proceeded to go backstage, he thanked the crowd for their support.\nThe sixth match was the \"Playboy\" BunnyMania Lumberjack match, in which Maria and Ashley (the latter who replaced Candice Michelle due to injury) faced Beth Phoenix and Melina, who were accompanied to the ring by Santino Marella. Rapper Snoop Dogg served as the official \"Master of Ceremonies\" for the match. In the match, several WWE Divas surrounded the ring and were able to interfere in the match without disqualifications. Due to some technical difficulties, the lights at Citrus Bowl temporarily went out during the match. Near the end, a pin attempt by Maria was prevented when Marella pulled Maria's leg. In response, Raw commentator Jerry Lawler approached and knocked Marella down with a punch. Phoenix executed a Fisherman Suplex and pinned Maria to win the match. After the match, Snoop Dogg executed a Clothesline on Marella and kissed Maria, before leaving with her and Ashley.\nNext was Randy Orton defending his WWE Championship against Triple H and John Cena in a triple threat match, which is a standard match involving three wrestlers with no disqualifications. For his entrance, Cena had the Jones High School Marching Tigers marching band perform an instrumental version of his theme song \"The Time Is Now\" live. During the match, when Triple H had held Orton in a sleeper hold, Cena picked up both Orton and Triple H for an FU, but Triple H dropped down and low blowed him. Orton then dominated the match for some time; one highlight of the match featured Orton performing a crossbody from the top rope on Cena, while the latter was held on Triple H's shoulders in a seating position. Orton also performed a DDT to both Cena and Triple H simultaneously. Orton then tried to perform an RKO on Cena, but he countered and threw Orton onto Triple H. Triple H then started targeting Orton's legs and using some submissions on him. The match came to an end when Cena had Triple H on his shoulders for the FU, but was countered into a Pedigree. As Triple H was in the pin, Orton punted Triple H and pinned Cena to win the match and retain the WWE Championship.\nThe next match was the No Disqualification match between Big Show and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Early in the match, Mayweather repeatedly escaped Big Show's grasp and delivered body shots to him. Mayweather and his accomplices tried to \"walk out\" of the match, but Big Show walked up the ramp and brought Mayweather back in the ring. As Big Show was about to chokeslam Mayweather, one of Mayweather's accomplices struck a steel chair on Big Show's back, and the latter chokeslammed him in retaliation. Capitalizing from this distraction, Mayweather grabbed that chair and hit Big Show multiple times on the head with it. Finally, Mayweather removed his right glove and put on a pair of brass knuckles to hit Big Show in the face. As a result, Big Show was knocked out as he could not answer the referee's ten count, and Mayweather was declared the winner.&lt;ref name=\"Mayweather/Show\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe main event of the night saw Edge putting his World Heavyweight Championship on the line against The Undertaker. This was The Undertaker's first WrestleMania main event in 11 years, last main eventing against Sycho Sid at WrestleMania 13. The early going of the match was slow-paced, in which both superstars countered each other's maneuvers. During the match, Undertaker ran and leapt over the top rope from the ring onto Edge on the outside. Then throughout the match, Edge was able to counter Undertaker's numerous signature moves, including the Chokeslam, Old School and the Last Ride, a variation of the powerbomb. Near the end, Edge hit Undertaker with a television camera while the referee was knocked down. When he proceeded to deliver a Tombstone Piledriver to Undertaker, Undertaker countered it into his own version and successfully delivered it to Edge for a two-count. Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder came to the ring for Edge's aid, but Undertaker took them out. Because of their distraction, Edge was able to execute a spear on Undertaker, but was unable to pin him. When Edge delivered another spear to Undertaker, Undertaker applied Hell's Gate and forced Edge to submit to win the World Heavyweight Championship, improving his WrestleMania record to 16–0.\nReception.\nApproximately 1,058,000 people ordered WrestleMania XXIV, grossing $23.8 million in revenue. This number was fewer than the 1,188,000 buys that WrestleMania 23 achieved. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section gave the entire event 9 out of 10 stars. The rating was higher than WrestleMania 23 which received 8 out of 10 stars. The main event between The Undertaker and Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship was rated a 9.5 out of 10 stars. The Career Threatening match between Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels was rated a perfect 10 out of 10. Big Show vs. Floyd \"Money\" Mayweather Jr. was rated 7 out of 10 stars, and the Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship between Randy Orton, Triple H and John Cena was rated 8.5 out of 10 stars.\nAftermath.\nAfter the show, WWE was criticized for a malfunction in the pyrotechnics during The Undertaker's victory celebration. During the celebration, a hot cable for pyrotechnics was sent flying into audience members in the upper seating bowl of the stadium, leaving 45 injured, with some hospitalized. The accident was apparently due to a cable which fireworks were traveling across snapping, thus resulting in the fireworks exploding into the top rows of the upper bowl of the stadium. WWE's corporate website released a statement afterward stating that they would investigate the incident, but the results of the investigation were never released.\nOn the following episode of \"Raw\", Ric Flair made his farewell speech, which led to Triple H introducing various people from Flair's past, such as the Four Horsemen, Ricky Steamboat, and others, each coming out to give an emotional farewell. Afterward, the entire WWE roster came out to say thank you to Flair (Including Undertaker, who came out after Raw went off the air and hugged Flair and did his kneeling stance). Shawn Michaels, who was clearly upset about retiring Flair, was forgiven by Flair. Despite Flair's forgiveness, his former protégé Batista later started a feud with Michaels, citing Michaels' \"selfishness\" at WrestleMania for not lying down for Flair. The two had a match booked at Backlash, and after a confrontation between Michaels and Chris Jericho, Jericho was later added into the match as a Special Guest Referee. Michaels won with a superkick.\nThe feud between Randy Orton, John Cena and Triple H continued after WrestleMania with the added involvement of John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) leading to a Fatal Four-Way Elimination match between all four at Backlash. At Backlash, Triple H won his seventh WWE Championship by last pinning Orton. With Matt Hardy's return at WrestleMania, his feud with Montel Vontavious Porter over the WWE United States Championship, that had started in July 2007, was revived with a match booked at Backlash, which Hardy won. The rivalries between The Undertaker and Edge and the one between Kane and Chavo Guerrero both continued with successful title defenses at Backlash. On the May 2 episode of \"SmackDown\", General Manager Vickie Guerrero stripped The Undertaker of the World Heavyweight Championship because of his continued use of his illegal chokehold, claiming she did it to protect the other wrestlers.\nDVD / Blu-ray release.\nThe event was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc by WWE Home Video in the U.S. on May 20, 2008, after it had completed broadcast on pay-per-view. It was also released on UMD on August 23 2008. It was the first WWE PPV event to be released via the Blu-ray and UMD format. As well as the event, the DVD/BD release features bonus material in the form of the 2008 Hall of Fame ceremony in its entirety and the battle royal that took place before the event."

        "title": "WWF WrestleMania (1989 video game)",
        "text": "WWF WrestleMania (named after the annual pay-per-view event) is a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) video game created by Rare and published by Acclaim Entertainment in 1989. It was the first WWF licensed NES game and the second WWF game overall, the first being \"MicroLeague Wrestling\". \"WrestleMania\" also marked the beginning of a long relationship between Acclaim and the WWF which lasted ten years. Released just months prior to WrestleMania V, it was intended to help build up to that event. The game's title screen features the tagline for WrestleMania III: \"Bigger. Better. Badder\".\nA Game Boy version started development in 1990 but was cancelled. It was developed by Zippo Games and designed by John Pickford. Rare later developed a follow-up game, \"WWF WrestleMania Challenge\". A contemporary VCR board game version, designed by Interactive VCR Games was also released around the same time, as well as a handheld version.\nGameplay.\nThe game features six wrestlers: Hulk Hogan, André the Giant, \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase, Bam Bam Bigelow and The Honky Tonk Man. All wrestlers possess a limited number of moves, which consist of basic standing punches and kicks, headbutts, a running attack, a move off the turnbuckle (which André the Giant and Bam Bam Bigelow cannot perform), and a bodyslam (which Bam Bam Bigelow and Honky Tonk Man cannot perform). All wrestlers also possess a \"back attack\" that they can use on an opponent standing behind them (usually a backwards punch). The moves themselves are somewhat tailored to each wrestler (Randy Savage, for example, uses elbow smashes instead of punches, while Bam Bam Bigelow has two running attacks instead of one, and Ted Dibiase uses eye gauges instead of kicks). It is also worth noting that only Hulk Hogan is able to bodyslam the massive André the Giant. The wrestlers cannot leave the ring and can only execute turnbuckle attacks from the bottom two corners. Sometimes, while a wrestler is taking punishment, he will turn red, indicating anger. An \"angry\" wrestler can inflict more damage than normal while in this state. Occasionally, during a match, an icon will come on screen that a wrestler can pick up to gain health. The icons are unique to each wrestler (for example, Honky Tonk Man's looks like a guitar, André's looks like a massive foot, while Hulk Hogan's looks like a crucifix) and cannot be used interchangeably (wrestlers can only pick up their own icons).\nPlayers can either play a single exhibition match (one player versus the computer or two players head-to-head) or a tournament. In a single player tournament, the player chooses one wrestler and must defeat the other five in a series of matches to win the championship. In a tournament with two or more player-controlled wrestlers (up to six can play), each wrestler faces every other wrestler once (fifteen total matches). At the end of the tournament, the wrestler with the best record wins the championship. In the event of a tie, the wrestler in the tie who achieved the single fastest victory during the tournament will be declared the winner.\nIn popular culture.\nA scene in the 2008 film \"The Wrestler\" features a fictional NES game entitled \"Wrestle Jam '88\". The fully functioning demo features a style inspired by \"WWF WrestleMania\"."

        "title": "History of the Rugby World Cup",
        "text": "The first Rugby Union World Cup was held in 1987, hosted by Australia and New Zealand who pushed for the tournament to be approved. Since the first tournament, 9 others have been held at four-year intervals.\nInternational competition prior to the World Cup.\nApart from regular test matches and touring sides, tournaments that resembled a world cup format – albeit not of its scale, but in terms of international nations competing, are competitions such as the Summer Olympics and the Home Nations Championship/Five Nations Championship.\nRugby union was played at the Summer Olympics on four occasions, 1900, 1908, 1920 and 1924. These competitions did not involve full national sides, and usually only had three or four participating nations at any individual event. The International Championship/Five Nations, now the Six Nations Championship, has been played since 1883. It is one of the oldest international rugby tournaments, involving only European nations.\nEarly attempts.\nThere are several stories that depict suggestions of staging a rugby union world cup before the 1980s. One of the earliest known pioneers was Harold Tolhurst, an Australian player who would later become a referee. It has been said that Tolhurst brought up the idea of such a tournament as early as the late 1950s. It has been said that in 1968, the International Rugby Board made it known that it did not want its unions to be a part of such a competition that resembled a world cup.\nSimilar ideas arose during the last years of the pre-WC era. Bill McLaughlin, who was the president of the Australian Rugby Union in 1979, suggested the idea of staging a World Cup in 1988, as the event would coincide with Australia's bicentenary celebrations.\nEarly 1980s.\nIn 1982, Neil Durden-Smith suggested that the world cup should be held in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s. The IRB discussed the proposal in March 1983, but the concept did not go ahead. Another meeting was held in June 1983, where Australia put forth a proposal that would see them host the first event – if it should happen. New Zealand joined the campaign, putting forth their own proposal in March of the next year. The IRB went on to conduct a feasibility study – Australia and New Zealand joined forces to bid for the hosting of an inaugural World Cup.\nA subsequent IRFB meeting was held in Paris in March 1985. It is known that originally, all four home nations were opposed to the idea, and the most vocal supporters were Australia, New Zealand and France. It is believed that South Africa's decision to vote in favour of the event was the turning point in the voting. South Africa voted in favour of the tournament going ahead, though they knew they would not be competing due to the sports boycott at the time. South Africa's vote saw England, followed by Wales, change to be in favour as well.\nThe first tournament.\nThe 1987 Rugby World Cup was hosted by both Australia and New Zealand. 32 matches were played from over a period of 22 May to 20 June. The tournament featured one African nation, three American nations, one Asian nation, seven European nations and four Oceanic nations. One notable omission was the Springboks who were not competing due to the international sports boycott.\nSeven places were automatically filled by the IRFB members, with invitations being sent out to fill remaining places. In total there were 16 nations in the competition. France played Australia in one of the semi-finals with New Zealand playing Wales in the other. New Zealand became the first ever Rugby World Cup Champions, defeating France 29-9 at Eden Park in Auckland.\n1990s.\nThe 1991 Rugby World Cup was hosted by Great Britain, Ireland and France, with the tournament final to be played at the home of English rugby, Twickenham. For the first time, a qualifying tournament replaced the previously used invitation format. The qualifying tournament involved 32 teams. England qualified for the final by defeating Scotland at Murrayfield, with Australia joining them by defeating New Zealand the day after. Australia won the final, defeating England 12–6, and became the first nation to win the cup away from home.\nThe 1995 Rugby World Cup was hosted by South Africa, and was the first time that all matches would be played in just a single country. It was the first time that South Africa participated in the tournament following the end of their international sports boycott due to the apartheid regime. South Africa won the tournament, defeating New Zealand 15–12 in the final. Joel Stransky kicked a drop-goal in extra time to grab the victory for South Africa. The All Blacks were mysteriously struck down with food poisoning just days before the final with many All Blacks still affected on the day of the final. Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok jersey and matching cap, famously presented the Webb Ellis Cup to South African captain Francois Pienaar. The tournament also saw the emergence of rugby's first global superstar, All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu. He and Marc Ellis finished the tournament as the top try scorers.\nThe 1999 Rugby World Cup was hosted by Wales with matches played in England, France, Scotland and Ireland. There were further changes to the rules of automatic qualification for this tournament, where only the top three places from 1995, along with the host nation, automatically qualified. Sixty-five rugby nations participated in qualifying competitions for the 1999 tournament, and the participating nations increased from 16 to 20. France's shock 43–31 semifinal win over the All Blacks is regarded as one of the biggest upsets and also one of the best games in the history of the World Cup. Australia defeated France in the final 35–12. They therefore became the first nation to win the World Cup twice.\n2000 – present.\nThe 2003 World Cup was hosted by Australia. It was originally to be co-hosted with New Zealand, but disagreements over scheduling and signage at venues led to Australia going it alone. England won the tournament, defeating Australia in the final 20 points to 17. With 21 seconds left before sudden death England's Jonny Wilkinson landed a drop goal to win the match. England became the first northern hemisphere nation to win a Rugby World Cup. Upon returning home, the English side was greeted by an estimated 750,000 people at a street parade celebrating their victory.\nThe 2007 World Cup was held in France, with matches also played in Wales and Scotland. The tournament was won by South Africa, who defeated England 15–6 in the final to become World Champions for the second time. Blowouts in scores in pool matches against minnow nations changed into a finals series dominated by defence. This tournament was notable for Argentina becoming the first team from outside the Six Nations and Tri-Nations to reach the semifinals. They ended up coming third in the tournament, which was the first time the top 3 slots were not dominated by either New Zealand, Australia, England, South Africa, France or Wales. This tournament was the first time that both Australia and New Zealand did not progress past the quarter-finals.\nThe 2011 tournament was hosted by New Zealand: it saw a repeat of the 1987 World Cup finale standings, as Australia took on Wales in the Bronze final and won 21–18, while New Zealand, by defeating France 8–7 in the final, became the first nation to win on home soil twice. This tournament was notable for the fact that France lost twice in the pool stages, to NZ and Tonga, and yet somehow managed to progress all the way to the Final to face off with NZ one more time.\nThe 2015 tournament was hosted by England. The tournament was won by New Zealand, who defeated Australia 34–17 to become the first nation to successfully defend their World Champion title and the first nation to win the tournament three times. This was the first time New Zealand had won the cup away from home. This tournament is notable for the controversial Pool of Death that occurred which saw Australia, England and Wales fight to get a place in the quarter-finals; the pool draw taking place in December 2012. Going into the tournament, England, Wales and Australia were all ranked in the top five in the world rankings. England became the second Host nation, after Wales in 1991, not to make it out of the Pools. This also became the first Rugby World Cup to have all Northern Hemisphere competition knocked out in the quarter-finals, with Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand progressing through to the semi-finals. This World Cup was also remembered for the biggest upset in Rugby history, when Japan beat South Africa 34 - 32 in the pool stages and came very close to making their first Quarter-finals.\nThe 2019 tournament was hosted in Japan, It was won by South Africa after they defeated England in the final. Some notable things that happened in this tournament were when Uruguay got their first RWC win since 2003, beating Fiji 30–27. Japan became the first quarter finalist from Asia, and the first Tier 2 nation to win a pool, with famous victories over Ireland (19-12) and Scotland (28-21). New Zealand lost their first RWC game since 2007 when England defeated them in the semi-finals 19–7.\nOn 15 November 2017 France was announced as host of the 2023 Rugby World Cup.The tournament was won by South Africa, who defeated New Zealand 12–11 to become the second nation to successfully defend their World Champion title and the first nation to win the tournament four times. This was the second time and only nation that South Africa had won the cup after they lost a match in pool stage.\nOverall team performance records.\nThe following table shows the overall performance records of the teams from the Six Nations and The Rugby Championship, plus the teams that made the knock-out stages (the quarter-finals) in at least one of the World Cups played so far. If they played in the tournament, the entries in the table show the stage at which they were knocked out, or whether they won the tournament. The second part of the table shows the number of times a team has reached that stage of the competition. For a more comprehensive table of the performance records of all the teams over the history of the World Cup, see National team appearances in the Rugby World Cup. Only Italy have played in all 9 world cups without getting past the group stages. For the all-time table of national teams that have featured in the Rugby World Cup by a number of criteria including matches, wins, losses, draws, total points for, total points against, etc., see Rugby World Cup Overall Record.\nDefending champions.\nOnly New Zealand, in 2015, and South Africa, in 2023 have successfully defended their title in the World Cup. The stage at which the defending champions were knocked out has been: 1991 – SF – New Zealand knocked out by Australia; 1995 – QF – Australia knocked out by England; 1999 – SF – South Africa knocked out by Australia; 2003 – F – Australia knocked out by England; 2007 – F – England knocked out by South Africa; 2011 - QF - South Africa knocked out by Australia; 2019 - SF - New Zealand knocked out by England. Australia's loss in the quarter-finals in 1995, and South Africa's loss in the quarter-finals in 2011 are the worst performances by the defending champions.\nKnockout statistics.\nFor the teams that made the knock-out stages (quarter-finals) of the World Cup, the following table shows which team knocked them out of the competition, unless they won. England have knocked out Australia four times, including in the 2003 final. In the same time, England have been knocked out four times by South Africa, including in the 2007 final and the 2019 final. France have been knocked out three times by both New Zealand and England, while the All Blacks have also eliminated Scotland three times.\nAll-time qualified teams.\nThis table shows all teams to ever qualify for the final tournament, ranked by last participation."

The format included nine direct qualifiers and a further fifteen qualifiers from all six regions defined by the IRB. A women's version of the world cup was also held alongside the men's tournament for the first time and featured sixteen teams. The men's cup was won by Wales, with the women's cup going to Australia.\nThe men's teams of Fiji, New Zealand and Australia, who entered the semi-finals in the two previous editions, failed to do so in 2009: the former were defeated by quarter-finals Kenya and Wales respectively, whereas Australia lost two of the three matches in the pool stage and did not advance to quarter-finals.\nWales, which had never reached quarter-finals in the previous editions of the World Cup, beat Samoa in semi-finals and Argentina in the final to win the tournament. Kenya had never reached the Cup or Plate stages before, but shared 3rd place in 2009.\nBids.\nA record seven countries originally expressed interest in hosting the tournament however, only five officially submitted bids for hosting rights after Kenya and South Africa withdrew from the bidding process. The United Arab Emirates, Australia, the Netherlands, Russia and the United States were the five candidates. The voting process consisted of two rounds. No clear majority was reached in the first round and therefore the top two, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Australia, progressed to a second round, with the IRB subsequently selecting the UAE as the host union. The IRB cited the provision of a new purpose built stadium, the recent success of the Dubai Sevens tournament and the Under 19 Rugby World Championship as strong factors in their decision to select the Arabian Gulf RFU as the host union.

        "title": "Graham James (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Graham Michael James (born February 7, 1952) is a former Canadian junior ice hockey coach who was convicted of sexually abusing players on his teams.\nAfter coaching the Swift Current Broncos to the 1989 Memorial Cup championship, he was named \"Man of the Year\" by \"The Hockey News\", an honour which was later revoked. In 1994, James became the general manager and coach of the Calgary Hitmen.\nJames attracted national attention two years later when NHL player Sheldon Kennedy came forward to accuse him of sexually abusing him over a period of years as his junior league coach. Kennedy also mentioned that another NHL player had endured the same abuse, but refused to name him. James pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. After completing his sentence, James obtained a federal pardon and left the country, settling in Spain and Mexico. However, in 2009, Theoren Fleury published a book alleging he too had been abused by James in the 1980s, which James again acknowledged as true. In March 2012, he was sentenced to another two years in prison.\nOn May 25, 2015, it was reported that James was facing additional sexual assault charges in Swift Current, Saskatchewan. The case was adjourned by Judge Violet Meekma until June 19, when the case was to be heard in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe disgraced former junior hockey coach was granted full parole in September 2016.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, on February 7, 1952, he played hockey until about the age of 18, when he stopped due to asthma attacks. He then allegedly graduated from university, and worked as a substitute teacher in St. James-Assiniboia School Division 2, Winnipeg, Manitoba. It wasn't until after he began his hockey coaching career that it became known that he hadn't graduated from university until after he completed the necessary courses for his B.A. while serving one of his prison sentences.\nBetween 1979 and 1983, he coached Junior A Hockey, winning the Manitoba provincial title with the Fort Garry Blues. In 1984, he was head scout for the Winnipeg Warriors of the Western Hockey League, and recruited two future National Hockey League players to the team, Theoren Fleury and Sheldon Kennedy. The team later relocated to Moose Jaw as the Moose Jaw Warriors, and in 1985 James was hired as head coach for the team.\nHe was the coach and general manager of the Swift Current Broncos from 1986 to 1994, leading them to WHL titles in 1989 and 1993. The team also won the Memorial Cup in 1989, and in the same year James was named Man of the Year by \"The Hockey News\", the award subsequently being revoked by the magazine. He was coach of the Broncos when four of their players were killed after the team bus overturned on December 30, 1986. In 1994, James became the part owner, head coach and general manager of the expansion Calgary Hitmen, a new WHL franchise. He resigned during the 1996–97 season and was replaced by Dean Clark.\nSexual abuse.\nIn 1996, Sheldon Kennedy and another unnamed player came forward with complaints about sexual abuse they had suffered between 1984 and 1995, and on November 22, 1996, Calgary Police Service charged James with sexual assault. On January 2, 1997, James pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault involving more than 350 encounters with two underage players over a span of 10 years, and was sentenced to three and a half years in jail. He was paroled in 2001. The players referred to whomever James targeted as \"Graham's new favourite\". James was charismatic and consistently successful as a coach. Even during his investigation, he was able to secure character references from respected hockey people and former players. He claimed that his relationship with Sheldon Kennedy was consensual and it was not illegal or immoral. James noted that he was attracted to males, primarily between the ages of 15 and 25, but kept these feelings closeted.\nIn 1999, a civil lawsuit against James, the Canadian Hockey Association, the Western Hockey League and other hockey organizations was filed by an unnamed victim of James and his parents. It was settled out of court in 2003.\nJames was given a lifetime ban from coaching by the Canadian Hockey Association. When the CHA learned that James was coaching in Spain, it complained to European ice hockey officials, and he was fired. His subsequent whereabouts were unclear, though there were some rumours that he was living in Montreal. In May 2010, he was located by a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation investigative reporter, living in Guadalajara, Mexico.\nIn a memoir entitled \"Playing with Fire: The Theo Fleury Story\", retired NHL player Theo Fleury alleged that from the age of 14 James had molested him for years during his time on the Moose Jaw Warrior team. On January 6, 2010, Fleury filed a criminal complaint with the City of Winnipeg police. \"I have been reflecting on this a long time\", said Fleury. \"I wanted to make the biggest impact on preventing this kind of thing from happening in the future.\" James pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting Fleury's cousin Todd Holt and Fleury, saying he had assaulted both of his former players hundreds of times over the course of many years while they were teenagers. A third victim, Greg Gilhooly, also filed a complaint with the police. James refused to plead guilty to the charges relating to Gilhooly's assault and, consequently, the Gilhooly charges were stayed. James was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for these crimes.\nNew charges.\nOn December 7, 2011, James pleaded guilty to sexual assaults involving two of his former players, former NHL star Theoren Fleury and Todd Holt, a cousin of Fleury's.\nOn March 20, 2012, he was sentenced to two years in prison, submitting DNA sample to national sex offender registry, and a lifetime ban on \"volunteering in a position of trust to children\". The new charges arose from Theoren Fleury's autobiography in which he describes the abuse.\nPardon.\nOn April 4, 2010, it was revealed in the media that James had been issued a pardon by the Canadian National Parole Board in 2007. News of the pardon came to light only when an unidentified Winnipeg man brought an allegation of abuse against him. The situation surrounding the pardon provoked outrage, and has led to proposed changes to the Canadian pardon system.\nOn October 25, 2010, James was taken into custody at Pearson International Airport in Toronto. He was wanted in Winnipeg on nine counts of sexual assault, and was released on bail in December of that same year.\nCrown appeal.\nOn February 15, 2013, the Manitoba Court of Appeal revised James' sentence from two years to five years, after the Crown successfully argued Judge Catherine Carlson erred in sentencing principles on March 20, 2012, by putting too much weight into James' previous sentence of 3 1/2 years served in 1997."

        "text": "Michael Devin Griffin (born January 4, 1985) is an American former professional football player who was a safety for 10 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Texas Longhorns. He was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the first round of the 2007 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nA native of Austin, Texas, Griffin attended Bowie High School, where he was a two-year starter at running back and also started at defensive back as a senior. He earned honorable mention All-State Class 5A honors on offense and was also named Academic All-District and All-Central Texas as a two-way performer that year. He was also the District 25-5A Offensive MVP, as he rushed for 1,181 yards and 11 touchdowns on 132 carries (8.9 average) and caught six passes for 112 yards, including a score in 2002. He also added 46 tackles, three pass deflections and a forced fumble on defense. His top games of the 2002 season were in wins against Hays Consolidated (226 yards and three scores) and Austin (207 yards and three touchdowns). Griffin earned All-District honors as a junior after rushing for 946 yards and 14 touchdowns on 126 attempts (7.5 avg). He also had 11 receptions for 286 yards and four scores. During his final two seasons at Bowie, Griffin rushed for 2,127 yards and 25 touchdowns on the ground along with averaging 23.4 yards per catch.\nIn addition to football, Griffin also earned two letters in basketball as a guard and forward and three in track &amp; field, competing in the sprints and mile relays. He qualified for the Regional track and field meet after posting personal-bests of 10.64 seconds in the 100-meter dash and 22.10 seconds in the 200-meter dash in his senior year.\nRegarded as a four-star recruit, Griffin was the 9th-ranked cornerback recruit in the nation and the 60th player overall according to Rivals.com in a 2003 class that was highlighted by Antonio Cromartie and Donte Whitner. Griffin committed to play college football for the Texas Longhorns on December 13, 2002. He chose the Longhorns over scholarship offers from Baylor, Oklahoma and Texas A&amp;M.\nCollege career.\nGriffin attended the University of Texas in Austin, where he started his college football career in 2003 as a true freshman for the Texas Longhorns football team. In 50 career games at Texas, Griffin started 28 times. He ranks eighth in school history with 368 tackles (234 of them solo). He produced four sacks for a loss of 46 yards, 14.5 stops for losses of 78 yards and 13 quarterback pressures. He recovered seven fumbles and caused nine others. His eight blocked kicks set a school career record and rank second in NCAA Division I-A history. He deflected 23 passes and intercepted eight others for 41 yards (5.1 average) in returns. He also totaled 124 yards on six blocked punt returns (20.7 average). On special teams, he posted 49 tackles.\nGriffin was immediately thrust into the action in 2003, appearing in all 12 games at strong safety and starting at nickel back against Washington State and Texas Tech. He finished seventh on the team with 65 tackles (51 of them solo), adding two sacks, five stops for losses and three pressures. In addition, he recovered a fumble and caused three others while also batting down two passes.\nIn Griffin's sophomore season, 2004, he played behind Michael Huff at strong safety, earning his only start against Michigan in the 2005 Rose Bowl. He produced 49 tackles (37 of them solo) with a sack, two stops behind the line of scrimmage and a pair of pressures. He blocked two punts, picked off a pass and deflected three others. He also caused and recovered a fumble.\nWith Michael Huff entrenched at strong safety, Texas' coaches shifted Griffin to free safety for his junior season in 2005. A starter in 12 of 13 games, he was a second-team All-Big 12 Conference choice, as he led the team with 124 tackles (67 of them solo), including four stops for losses and five pressures. He tied the school single-season record with four blocked kicks and had three interceptions with eight pass break-ups. He recovered three fumbles and caused another. Griffin intercepted a pass at the goal line in Texas' 41-38 Rose Bowl win against USC for the national championship.\nAs a senior in 2006, Griffin earned second-team All-American and first-team All-Big 12 accolades. He again led the team from his free safety position, collecting a career-high 126 tackles (79 of them solo) with a sack, 3.5 stops for losses and three pressures. He caused four fumbles, recovered two others and blocked two kicks. He deflected 10 passes and had four interceptions.\nProfessional career.\nTennessee Titans.\nOn May 4, 2007, head coach Jeff Fisher stated that Griffin would be moved from safety to cornerback due to Adam Pacman Jones year long suspension, however later on in the season Griffin was moved back to safety after depth at the cornerback position developed better than expected and starting free safety Calvin Lowry was unable to prevent big plays. Griffin finished the season with three interceptions and one forced fumble (all of which came at the safety position), as well as fifty-four total tackles.\nIn Griffin's second NFL season in 2008 he finished with 75 tackles, 1 forced fumble, 7 interceptions and 11 pass deflections while playing all 16 games.

        "title": "Philippine Basketball League",
        "text": "The Philippine Basketball League (PBL) was a commercial semi-professional basketball league in the Philippines. The league was composed of several commercial teams with several collegiate and provincial stars.\nHistory.\nThe PBL was formed on May 6, 1983, a brainchild of San Miguel Corporation chairman Danding Cojuangco, under its original name the Philippine Amateur Basketball League (PABL). It was the successor of the defunct Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA), which folded during the early-1980s. During the inaugural PABL tournament, 37 teams divided into four divisions from collegiate and commercial ranks participated in the tournament that was played in the historic Rizal Memorial Coliseum. De La Salle University emerged champion in the league's dry-run.\nTowards the end of 1983, 16 teams founded the PABL and the league held its first official tourney, the Founder's Cup. Arellano University was the champion of the tournament. During their second year in 1984, three PABL tournaments were held: the Ambassador's Cup won by Development Bank of Rizal, the President's Cup and the Invitationals, the two latter won by ESQ Marketing.\nIn 1985, the PABL scored a big breakthrough. Faced with an economic crisis, the league was able to get the sponsorship of San Miguel Corporation. Eighteen teams joined the 1st SMC-sponsored Invitationals with ESQ Marketing winning its third straight title against a strong Lagerlite crew. With the tremendous success of the tournament, San Miguel again agreed to be the sole sponsor of the second PABL conference that year, won by Army Jungle Fighters, dubbed as the \"Challenge to Champions\", Sixteen teams saw action. The cast included 12 commercial teams and 4 collegiate squads especially the NCAA and UAAP champions, San Sebastian College and University of the East.\nIn the 1990s, the league was renamed as the Philippine Basketball League under Andy Jao, who would later return to the broadcasting panel of the PBA coverage on Vintage Sports. Jao's replacement, Charlie Favis later adopted a new theme, calling the PBL as the \"faster league\". Yeng Guiao replaced Favis, when Guiao left the coaching ranks. The league gained early success with the dominance of the Tanduay Rhum Masters, the arrival of Eric Menk and Asi Taulava, and the holding PBL games at the air-conditioned Makati Coliseum.\nIn 2000, former Vintage Sports commentator Chino Trinidad replaced Guiao, when the commissioner resigned to coach Red Bull in the Philippine Basketball Association, the country's premier professional basketball league. The PBL's popularity grew, inviting commercial teams bannered by single collegiate teams, and the league also gained a stable broadcast partner in Studio 23 (now S+A). In 2007, PBL broke away from Studio 23 and signed an agreement with cable channel Basketball TV to broadcast the games. Chino Trinidad announced in March 2010 that he would be retiring as commissioner of the PBL and said he would be focusing his career as correspondent of GMA Network. \nThrough an agreement between the PBL and the Liga Pilipinas, a joint tournament was held in June 2010. The agreement was made as dry-run of a proposed \"Developmental League\", which was initiated by the Philippine Basketball Association, just like NBA's D-League. The tournament was to be named \"Tournament of the Philippines\". Tournament of the Philippines started June 9, 2010, and used the Liga Pilipinas' home-and-away leg format with 9 teams involved, 3 from the PBL and 6 from Liga Pilipinas. M.Lhuillier Kwarta Padala-Cebu Ninos became the 1st (and last) TOP champions by defeating Misamis Oriental Meteors, 3–2. After the tournament, merger talks between the 2 leagues went sour and were put off for good. The Philippine Basketball Association then announced that they would organize instead the \"PBA Developmental League\", or the PBA D-League, on their own after merger talks between PBL and Liga Pilipinas failed.\nIn 2011, the PBL's board of governors named Nolan Bernardino, son of former PBA commissioner Emilio \"Jun\" Bernardino, as the new PBL commissioner, while Sports Vision, the company behind the success of Shakey's V-League, was named as the group that would handle PBL's day-to-day operations. However, the league experienced great difficulty finding six teams for the 2011 opening tournament when four of the teams that had earlier confirmed their participation jumped ship to the PBA D-League, namely Pharex, Agri Nurture-FCA, Cafe France and Cobra Energy Drink. PBL Commissioner Nolan Bernardino said he had already been informed of the matter and that he respected the transferring teams' decisions. This resulted in the PBL being disbanded.\nMedia.\nBeginning the 2007 season, the PBL games were seen on Basketball TV (a channel of the Solar family of cable networks) after several years of being shown on UHF television station Studio 23. Games were televised every Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays from 5-9 pm Philippine time plus rebroadcasts on BTV in the wee hours of the morning. RPN also had a delayed telecast of Tuesday's second game, but this was moved to IBC-13 on Saturdays, until the season-ending 2008 Lipovitan Amino Sports Cup. The coverage eventually returned to RPN named as C/S 9. The telecast of the games were live but the other games were delayed subject to prior coverage of the games until 2010.\nPrior to BTV, previous broadcasters included ABS-CBN, People's Television Network, Silverstar Sports, Solar Sports and Vintage Television, as the games were usually put on airtime slots. With ABS-CBN, the league initially forged a deal in 2003 as a blocktimer, then in 2004 renewed ties to make ABS-CBN Sports its official TV producer/coverer and Studio 23 its official carrying station of the games.\nDZSR Sports Radio 918 kHz, a government station, had been airing the PBL games on radio since the start of the PABL back in the mid-1980s.\nIn 2002, the league opened its official website, myPBL.com, powered by E-Highway. In 2007, the website transferred to a new address at PhilippineBasketballLeague.org with the alternate address, PBL.org.ph. These sites are now defunct.\nThe PBL and the Philippine Basketball Association.\nThe Philippine Basketball Association, the premier basketball league in the country, has a special relationship with the PBL; several teams in the PBL are owned by companies also having PBA teams (such as San Miguel Corporation's PBL team is San Mig Coffee, with SMC also owning 3 PBA teams). The PBL is also one of the leagues where the PBA gets their players. Even quite a few successful PBL teams transferred to the PBA (although a system of promotion and relegation is not practiced in the Philippines), such as Purefoods, Sta. Lucia, Red Bull, and Welcoat."

        "text": "James Goodwin Bowden IV (born May 18, 1961) is an American baseball analyst. He is a co-host of SiriusXM's \"Inside Pitch\" on MLB Network Radio and a columnist for The Athletic. He previously worked for ESPN, writing a blog for ESPN.com titled \"The GM's Office\". He used to be a host and co-host on Fox Sports Radio, a baseball analyst for FoxSports.com and a Baseball Insider for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels for Fox Sports West. He has held positions of senior vice president and general manager for both the Cincinnati Reds and Washington Nationals. On October 16, 1992 he became the youngest general manager in baseball history. He was named MLB Executive of the Year by \"Baseball America\" in 1999. Bowden's teams finished in first place in 1994 and 1995. Bowden has also worked in television for ESPN and Fox Sports West as well as local television and radio stations in both Cincinnati and Washington, D.C.\nEarly life and career.\nBowden was born in Boston, Massachusetts and raised in Weston, Massachusetts and Boothbay Harbor, Maine. He graduated from Rollins College in 1983 with a B.A. degree in communications and business administration. He was the sports director at the college radio station as well doing the play by play for both the baseball and soccer teams. His broadcast partners included Chris \"Mad Dog\" Russo (Class of 1982). His entry to professional baseball came as an assistant in the Pittsburgh Pirates media relations department in 1985. He was a former college roommate of Squire Galbreath, whose father Dan and grandfather John were the principal owners of the Pirates. General manager Syd Thrift was impressed with Bowden and asked him to join the Pirates' baseball operations department as an administrator. Bowden computerized the Pirates' scouting files, and became a protégé to Thrift. He followed Thrift to the New York Yankees, and eventually moved to the Cincinnati Reds where he was later promoted by the Reds Owner, Marge Schott, to general manager. He also served as team president during her suspension in 1993.\nGeneral manager.\nHis first role as a general manager was with the Cincinnati Reds at age 31 in 1992. When he took this position, he was the youngest general manager in the history of Major League Baseball. Bowden was named Major League Executive of the Year in 1999 by \"The Sporting News\" after leading one of the lowest payroll teams in baseball to 96 wins. In 1993 Bowden fired rookie manager Tony Pérez after only 44 games. Perez was a star player in Cincinnati and immensely popular with Reds fans. At the time, it was the earliest firing of a first-year manager in 65 years. The firing drew significant criticism from Cincinnati fans. However, he replaced Perez with Davey Johnson, who went on to lead the Reds to a division title in 1995. In 1998 Bowden traded Jeff Shaw to the Los Angeles Dodgers for infielder Paul Konerko and left-hander Dennys Reyes. This move was met with shock in the Cincinnati area as Shaw, an all-star and Cincinnati native, signed with the Reds at a discounted rate prior to the season. At the time Shaw was quoted as saying \"We had a handshake deal that he wasn't going to trade me. Three months later, he traded me ... If I had been in the room with him, I would have killed him.\" However, the Shaw-Konerko trade turned out to be a lopsided one, with Konerko making six All-Star teams in his career (later with the White Sox). He continued with the Reds until being fired in 2003. Bowden is perhaps best known for his drafting of Joey Votto, Adam Dunn, and Aaron Boone, and his trades for Ken Griffey Jr. Denny Neagle, John Smiley, Kevin Mitchell, Deion Sanders, José Guillén and Alfonso Soriano. He was the first GM to propose the use of Instant Replay in 1992 and also has supported the concept of trading amateur draft picks.\nAfter he was fired by Cincinnati, Bowden worked as a commentator on ESPN before being hired by Major League Baseball to serve as GM of the Montreal Expos, who were soon to become the Washington Nationals, in November 2004. The team acquired players such as Ryan Zimmermann, Alfonso Soriano, Adam Dunn, Josh Willingham, José Guillén, Danny Espinosa, Tyler Clippard, Luis Atilano, Jordan Zimmermann, Chris Marrero and Derek Norris during his tenure.\nIn 2006, Bowden traded Gary Majewski from the Nationals to the Reds along with Bill Bray, Royce Clayton, and Brendan Harris for Austin Kearns, Felipe López, and Ryan Wagner. The trade caused some controversy, as the Reds front office was apparently unaware of cortisone shots that had been given to Majewski because of arm pain before the trade. It was alleged that Majewski was known to be injured by Bowden and the trade was an attempt to dump him for some value to some unsuspecting team. In his time with the Nationals Majewski was an effective pitcher, with a 2.93 ERA in 2005 and a 3.58 ERA with Washington up until he was traded. With the Reds he had very little success, with a 7.28 ERA in parts of three seasons. He was not re-signed after the 2008 season and to date has not pitched in the major leagues again. A grievance was filed with MLB alleging misconduct by Jim Bowden and the Washington Nationals. MLB has never revealed their findings and no punishment is on record.\nIn February 2009, it was reported that Bowden along with former special assistant José Rijo were part of an FBI federal investigation into the skimming of signing bonus money from Latin American baseball players. He resigned from the Nationals on March 1, 2009.\nBroadcasting.\nBowden is a co-host of the Sirius XM Radio show \"Inside Pitch\", which airs on the MLB Network Radio channel. He also is a baseball analyst and insider for ESPN, participating in video shoots and podcasts on ESPN.com, and serves as a substitute analyst for \"Sunday Night Baseball\" broadcasts on ESPN Radio.\nHe has been a host on Fox Sports Radio, a baseball analyst for FoxSports.com, and a baseball insider for both the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for Fox Sports West. His broadcasting career has also included appearances for ESPN's \"Cold Pizza\", \"SportsCenter\", ESPNEWS, and \"Baseball Tonight\". He also worked for local television and radio stations in both Cincinnati, Ohio and Washington, D.C., while he was a Major League senior VP and general manager in each respective city for a combined 15 years."

        "title": "Commissaire (cycling)",
        "text": "In competitive cycling, a commissaire is an official approximately equivalent to an umpire or referee in other sports. The vast majority of cycling events require two or more commissaries to fulfil a variety of roles, including supervising pre-and post-race formalities, briefing riders and race officials, checking the compliance of equipment, monitoring compliance with the rules and maintaining safety during racing, resolving disputes and judging results. Sitting as a panel they serve as a \"race jury\" chaired by the Chief Commissaire to resolve contentious decisions, although this term is now deprecated. The Chief Commissaire or President of the Commissaires' Panel is the holder of ultimate authority over the event.\nCommissaires' administrative duties include checking riders' eligibility to compete and filing results and reports on race organisation, incidents and penalties.\nWithin the areas of the sport governed by the Union Cycliste Internationale, commissaires hold licences issued by their national federations. They qualify at various levels nationally, with the highest level, UCI International Commissaire, being assessed and awarded by the UCI itself. The UCI appoints the chief commissaires for international events on its calendar and the whole commissaires' panel for the most major events.\nIn the English-speaking world there have been sporadic efforts to rename commissaires in line with terms used in more locally familiar sports, although this can cause some confusion as some commissairing roles already use terms like \"judge\" and \"referee\". The British Cycling cycle speedway commission and The International Cycle Speedway Federation currently use the word 'referee'. There is no standard international uniform although some countries provide clothing; in the USA commissaires often wear the traditional black and white stripes worn by officials in American sports.\nDisciplines.\nRoad cycling.\nIn road racing, a tite of commissaires travel by car and sometimes motorcycle in the race convoy to supervise the riders and perform traffic management duties over team cars, neutral service vehicles, press and media vehicles and other vehicles in the race convoy. The chief commissaire – generally positioned in a car immediately behind the main bunch – decides when team cars can go up to the riders and which groups of riders need to have a commissaire with them when the race splits up. A separate judging team observe finishing sprints and intermediate primes and adjudicate the results with the assistance of photofinish and electronic timing equipment where available. A motorcycle commissaire may serve as a time-board official (\"ardoisier\") responsible for identifying the composition of groups and time gaps between them and keeping the riders and officials informed. In races on short circuits the commissaires may perform their duties from the side of the road rather than in the convoy. In areas where races are run on the open road or with minimal closures, commissaires may need to liaise with law enforcement.\nTrack cycling.\nAt a track meeting the main commissairing team will check machines, organise selection for heats, ensure riders are ready to take the track for their events, keep track of laps lost and gained in distance events and judge the results where required. A single commissaire in the role of commissaire-referee makes rapid decisions on breaches of the rules in relation to dangerous riding or irregular sprinting; their decisions are not subject to appeal.\nCyclo-cross.\nA commissaires role in the cyclo-cross is quite the same as in mountain biking. Making sure the track is safe. Checking equipment, and regulations up to that, keeping track of laps, and short-cutters.\nGrades.\nInternational commissaires.\nInternational commissaires must have at least two years of experience as a national commissaire, and are proposed to the UCI by their national governing body.\nNational commissaires can operate in other countries as 'observer commissaires' as long as they have the permission of both their own and the foreign governing bodies.\nWith effect from 01 Jan 2014 passing UCI Elite National Commissaire course is mandatory for appearing in an International commissaire examination.\nNational grades.\nCommissaire grades below this level are governed by the relevant national cycling sport organisation such as USA Cycling or British Cycling. Some split grades into A and B divisions in the same way as the UCI. Award of a commissaire's licence is generally dependent on passing a written exam on the rules and race operation.\nRetired commissaires can sometimes continue in a mentoring role as a 'senior commissaire'."

        "text": "Lester J. Harrison (August 20, 1904 – December 23, 1997) was an American professional basketball player, coach, and team owner and is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nCareer.\nHarrison was born in Rochester, New York. He attended East High School and led the high school to the championship over West High. The victory inspired him to get in the basketball business. In 1923, Harrison began playing, coaching, and organizing semi-professional basketball, working for the Rochester Seagrams, which were later known as the Rochester Ebers in order to appease the newspapers (resistant to liquor advertising).\nIn 1945, with his brother Joseph (Jack), Harrison founded his own semi-pro team, the Rochester Pros; in 1946, the franchise changed its name to Royals and began play in the National Basketball League (NBL). Harrison oversaw the NBL iteration of his team for three years, with head coach Eddie Malanowicz leading the Royals to three straight NBL finals (of which the team won one, over the Sheboygan Red Skins in 1946) and amassing a record of 99 wins and 43 losses. In 1946, Harrison, as team owner, signed Long Island University standout Dolly King; King became the first African American to have played in the league since 1943 and the first to see substantial playing time for his team. King received taunts from crowds at times, particularly in the playoff series on the road in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Fueled by their indignation of the insults directed at King, the Royals won the series at home in Rochester.\nAfter the 1947–48 season, Harrison moved his team to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and, after his team spent one year in the BAA, served on the committee that brokered the merger of the BAA and NBL and produced the National Basketball Association (NBA). He became coach of the team in 1948 while Malanowicz stayed as an assistant coach. Harrison was on the sideline for a historic game on January 6, 1951 when the Royals played the Indianapolis Olympians to a game that lasted six overtimes that saw the Royals lose 75-73, which saw eighteen combined points in the overtime periods as a total in a game that encapsulated the pre-shot clock era when it came to stalling with the ball. Harrison collected several talented players for the Royals that included Arnie Risen, nicknamed \"Stilts\" with his 6'9 frame to go with 6'5 Arnie Johnson and 6'7 Jack Coleman and a backcourt of Bob Davies and Bobby Wanzer. In the 1950-51 season, Royals went 41-27, second behind the perennial threat in the Minneapolis Lakers, who had won the last two championships. The two teams met for a best-of-five Division Finals that saw Rochester pull off three straight wins (including the last two in Rochester) to reach their first NBA Finals. As it turned out, the Royals were the only team to defeat the Lakers in their dynasty era (1948-1954), as the Lakers rebounded to win the next three NBA Finals. In the 1951 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks, the Royals won the first three games before the Knicks won the next three to force Game 7 in Rochester. The Knicks led 74-72 with under three minutes later but Risen and Davies (who combined for 44 points scored in the game) managed to draw quick shots and free throws in the final minutes to give the Royals a 79-75 victory. Harrison noted later that in those days, the NBA did not even have a trophy to give to the team for their championship and there was no parade for the team in the city. Harrison coached the Royals through the 1954–55 season and would retire having led his team to five NBA divisional titles and the 1951 NBA championship. \nHe remained owner of the Royals to the end of their tenure in Rochester. The 1956 NBA draft was the last for the Royals before their move, and they had the first pick of the draft. Owing to a variety of circumstances (Harrison had stated the team's need for a guard to go with Maurice Stokes), the Royals drafted Si Green over Bill Russell, who was selected by the St. Louis Hawks before being traded to the Boston Celtics for Ed Macauley and Cliff Hagan. After the season, the team moved to Cincinnati, Ohio prior to the 1957 season, with Harrison selling not long after. He noted his feeling on the matter in a 1993 interview, stating “I couldn’t help it. I lacked a five-letter word — I had no money. What happened to basketball is what I envisioned would happen. I thought even from the start that one day it would become big, real big, and it has.”\nHarrison coached many Naismith Basketball Hall of Famers, including Bob Davies, Red Holzman, Bobby Wanzer, Al Cervi, Arnie Risen, Pop Gates and Alex Hannum. He also coached Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Otto Graham, Chuck \"The Rifleman\" Connors and Del Rice, an MLB player and the manager of the California Angels in 1972.\nDeath.\nHarrison died at Highland Hospital in Rochester on December 23, 1997 at the age of 93. In light of having no wife or children (as was the case with his brother and sister) to leave his belongings to, he bequeathed his Hall of Fame ring, jacket, and artifacts to David and Wendy Dworkin (her mother Barabara was the cousin of Harrison).\nLegacy.\nIn view of his having been a member of the boards of directors of the NBL, BAA, and NBA, having helped broker the merger of the NBL and BAA, and having been a proponent of the introduction of the 24-second shot clock, Harrison was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor in 1980. His induction class included Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Jerry Lucas, Dallas Shirley and Everett Shelton. In 1990, he was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. For his part, Harrison in his later years stated the importance of Syracuse owner Danny Biasone (inducted into the Hall of Fame after his death in 2000) in getting the \"fans' interest\" with the shot clock that he was responsible for lobbying for the NBA to adopt in 1954; Harrison put his full support behind the idea done by Biasone along with Leo Ferris, which still is in use today.\nThe basketball court at the Blue Cross Arena in Rochester is named in his honor and plays host to the Section V high school basketball tournament each year. It also serves as home court for the Rochester Razorsharks of the Premier Basketball League."

        "title": "Ryan Johnson (ice hockey, born 1976)",
        "text": "Ryan M. Johnson (born June 14, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. He currently works as assistant general manager for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) and as the general manager for their American Hockey League (AHL) development team, the Abbotsford Canucks. \nPlaying career.\nPanthers and Lightning.\nJohnson was drafted by the Florida Panthers in the second round, 36th overall, of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He subsequently played two seasons of college hockey with the University of North Dakota. He scored 19 points in 21 games, splitting the 1995–96 season with the Canadian national team.\nIn his first three seasons with the Panthers, Johnson played with Florida's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliates, the Carolina Monarchs and the Beast of New Haven. In 1999–2000, he earned a full-time roster spot with the Panthers, but was traded during that season to the Tampa Bay Lightning with Dwayne Hay in exchange for Mike Sillinger on March 14, 2000.\nJohnson spent one full season with the Lightning, scoring 21 points in 2000–01. On July 10, 2001, he was traded back to the Panthers with a sixth-round draft pick (later traded back to Tampa Bay) in 2003 in exchange for Václav Prospal. However, he missed the majority of his first season back in Florida from a head injury suffered on December 22, 2001, against the St. Louis Blues.\nSt. Louis Blues.\nNear the trade deadline of the next season, he was placed on waivers and acquired by the St. Louis Blues on February 19, 2003. Johnson spent four full seasons with the Blues, playing with the Missouri River Otters of the United Hockey League (UHL) during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. After posting 18 points and leading all forwards in the league in shot blocks with 105 in 2007–08, Johnson became an unrestricted free agent in the off-season; he signed a two-year, $2.3 million contract with the Vancouver Canucks.\nVancouver Canucks.\nPlaying his first season in Vancouver, Johnson broke a finger on his right hand while blocking a shot in November against the Minnesota Wild. He played with the injury for two games before being pulled from the lineup. It was then revealed that Johnson had also suffered a broken bone in his left foot in the third game of the season, which he had played through for six weeks. After missing 20 games, Johnson returned to the lineup on January 9, 2009, despite still feeling considerable pain in his fractured finger. After completing his first season in Vancouver with 2 goals and 9 points in 62 games, it was revealed that off-season surgery was required for the injured finger.\nNearly a month into the 2009–10 season, Johnson was involved in a head-first collision into the end boards in a game against the Detroit Red Wings on October 27, 2009. After chipping the puck into the offensive zone, Johnson lost his balance trying to skate around Detroit defenceman Nicklas Lidström and slid heavily into the boards with his shoulder and neck. He was taken off the ice in a stretcher after laying motionless on the ice for several moments. After missing five games with a concussion, he was later sidelined for 12 games in January 2010 with a broken foot. He played through lingering injuries on both feet until suffering another broken foot while blocking a shot in early April. Limited to 58 games, Johnson scored one goal and five points along with six playoff games in the Blackhawks first round exit in seven games to Johnson's former team, the Presidents' Trophy-winning Vancouver Canucks.\nChicago Blackhawks.\nAfter not receiving a contract extension from the Canucks, Johnson became an unrestricted free agent. Unsigned to start the 2010–11 season, he was given a professional tryout with the Chicago Blackhawks' AHL affiliate, the Rockford Icehogs, in December 2010. He played one game for the Icehogs before signing a one-year deal with the Blackhawks. Immediately recalled after the deal, Johnson played his first game with the Blackhawks on December 17, 2010. He played 34 games for the Blackhawks in 2010–11 with 1 goal, 5 assists and 6 points\nPersonal life.\nJohnson was born to Jim and Judy Johnson in Thunder Bay, Ontario, on June 14, 1976. He has a sister, Sarah, and two older brothers: Greg, who played with the Detroit Red Wings, Pittsburgh Penguins, Chicago Blackhawks, and Nashville Predators; and Corey. After his father lost a battle with cancer on June 7, 2008, at age 63, Johnson completed a 42.2-kilometre marathon the following year on June 20, 2009, in Duluth, Minnesota, as a tribute. He finished the run in just under four hours at three hours, 59 minutes and 52 seconds."

Barr played junior hockey for the Billings Bighorns, Edmonton Oil Kings, Great Falls Americans, Portland Winter Hawks and Lethbridge Broncos of the Western Hockey League.\nCareer.\nPlaying career.\nBarr turned pro and played a total of 614 regular season games in the National Hockey League, notching 128 goals and 204 assists, for a total of 332 points, along with 520 PIM over his thirteen seasons. Because of his skill, work ethic and grit, Barr also became a valuable journeyman in the NHL – playing with seven different teams – including stops in Boston, New York (NYR), St. Louis, Hartford Detroit, New Jersey and Dallas. Following the NHL, he closed out his playing career with the IHL's Kalamazoo Wings and Orlando Solar Bears (where he was a player/assistant coach).\nCoaching.\nAfter his retirement as an active player, he continued with coaching, first as an assistant and then becoming the head coach of the Houston Aeros of the International Hockey League in the 2000–2001 season. He also served as general manager for the Aeros for two seasons (2001–2003), including winning the Calder Cup in 2003, as the Aeros were one of six IHL teams to join the American Hockey League (AHL) in 2001 when the IHL folded. Following his AHL success, he was the general manager and then general manager/head coach of the Guelph Storm of the OHL from 2003–2008, where his team won the OHL Championship in 2003–04 and Barr collected the Matt Leyden Trophy, emblematic of the league's Coach of the Year, in 2005–2006. Barr was also named as the head coach of Canada's National Men's Summer Under-18 Team for the Under-18 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament from August 14–18, 2007, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Barr left the OHL to become an assistant coach for the Colorado Avalanche of the NHL during the 2008–2009 NHL season but following a disappointing year in which they finished last overall in the NHL's Western Conference, the Avalanche fired their entire coaching staff. \nOn July 3, 2009, the Minnesota Wild hired Barr as an assistant coach. He was dismissed, along with head coach Todd Richards, by the Wild on April 11, 2011, in a Minnesota coaching staff restructuring. On July 29, 2011, Barr was named assistant coach of the New Jersey Devils, joining new coach Peter DeBoer on the staff. Barr was subsequently dismissed, along with head coach DeBoer, by the Devils on December 27, 2014, in a New Jersey coaching staff restructuring. On June 18, 2015, Dan Bylsma named him, along with Terry Murray, as assistant coaches of the Buffalo Sabres. On July 25, 2017, he was hired as an assistant coach for the San Jose Sharks to once again work under head coach Peter DeBoer, until he was fired along with the rest of the Sharks' coaching staff on December 11, 2019."

Connolly played eight seasons for the New England Patriots, winning Super Bowl XLIX over the Seattle Seahawks in his final season.\nEarly years.\nConnolly was born in Chesterfield, Missouri. He attended Marquette High School in Chesterfield, Missouri and was a letterman in Football and track. In football, he was a two-time All-District selection and a two-time All-Conference selection. In track and field, he threw the shot put.\nCollege career.\nHe was a four-year starting offensive tackle for Southeast Missouri State, and was in All-Conference teams for four consecutive seasons, and finished his collegiate career with 46 consecutive starts.\nProfessional career.\nJacksonville Jaguars (2005–2007).\nConnolly was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars as an undrafted free agent on April 24, 2005. He made the team's 53-man roster and spent the rest of the season on it. He was placed on injured reserve by the Jaguars on September 2, 2006. Connolly was waived by the Jaguars on September 1, 2007.\nNew England Patriots (2007–2014).\nConnolly was signed to the New England Patriots' practice squad on September 13, 2007, where he spent the remainder of the season before being re-signed to a future contract on February 5, 2008. He was then waived by the Patriots on October 20, 2008. He was re-signed to the team's practice squad on October 22. He was promoted to the active roster on December 13, 2008.\nConnolly made the 53-man roster in 2009 and started four games at right guard in place of an injured Stephen Neal.

Walton states he felt Scottish and that the English players called him 'Jock'.\nHe was then selected by Scotland on the basis that his 7 years schooling in Scotland gave him a genuine and credible link to the nation. At the time he was living in England but he was available to capped as the clauses above do not mention immediacy.\nThe Home Nations have since agreed that 5 years schooling is enough to provide a genuine and credible link to allow international selection in international football and this has been approved by FIFA. World Rugby still assess each case on their individual merits and the demonstration of a genuine, close, credible and established national link is key."

        "text": " \nChile's Nicolás Massú defeated the United States' Mardy Fish in the final, 6–3, 3–6, 2–6, 6–3, 6–4 to win the gold medal in Men's Singles tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics. In the bronze-medal match, Chile's Fernando González defeated the United States' Taylor Dent, 6–4, 2–6, 16–14. Massú became the only man to win both the singles and men's doubles gold medals at the same Olympic Games. The two medals were Chile's first in men's singles, and Massú's gold plus the Chileans' doubles gold remain the only two gold medals for Chile at the Olympics.\nThe tournament was held at the Olympic Tennis Centre in Athens, Greece. There were 64 players from 32 nations. The limit on players per nation had been four since the 2000 Games. Only the final match was best-of-five-sets; all others were best-of-three-sets.\nYevgeny Kafelnikov was the reigning gold medalist from 2000, but he retired from the sport in 2003.\nSwitzerland's Roger Federer was the world No. 1, but he lost to world No. 74 Tomáš Berdych of the Czech Republic in the second round.\nBackground.\nThe men's singles tournament of the 2004 Summer Olympics was held at the Athens Olympic Tennis Centre in Athens, Greece from 15 to 22 August 2004. Tennis was one of the original sports of the 1896 Summer Olympics. It was withdrawn after the 1924 Summer Olympics due to disagreements between the sport's governing body, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and the independent Olympic organisation, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) over how to define amateur athletes. The IOC reinstated Tennis to the Olympic programme as a demonstration sport at the 1968 Games and the 1984 Olympics before returning as a full medal sport open to all players at the 1988 Games. The 2004 tournament was the 12th official medal event in men's singles.\nFive of the eight quarterfinalists from the 2000 tournament returned: silver medalist Tommy Haas of Germany, fourth-place finisher Roger Federer of Switzerland, and three men eliminated in the quarterfinals: Max Mirnyi of Belarus, Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain, and Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil.\nAlgeria, Chinese Taipei, and Cyprus each made their debut in the event. France made its 11th appearance, most among all nations, having missed only the 1904 event.\nQualification.\nQualification for the single tournament was restricted to four players per National Olympic Committee (NOC), an organisation representing a country at the Olympics. National Tennis Associations who were members of the ITF before 1 January 2004 were allowed to nominate players for entry into the competition. The tournament featured a total of 64 players with 48 qualifying on their ITF World Ranking on 14 June and two received invitations from the Tripartite Commission. Any NOC who had more than four players able to qualify by this method were encouraged to choose their highest ranked players eligible to compete in the tournament. The remaining 14 qualified via wild card places: eight were selected on their world ranking and the remaining six were chosen on the basis of his world ranking, whether his country has representation in tennis, the number of players who were in Athens and his geographical location.\nPlayers who earned automatic entry into the draw and who withdrew from the competition due to illness, injury or bereavement before midnight on 7 August were replaced by one from his own country or the next highest ranking entry. Had this not been the case, then the ITF selected the highest ranked nominated player or eligible competitor if a country had more than four players to the tournament.\nPreview.\nSixteen players were seeded according to their final position in the ITF world rankings by the referee of the competition. The 2003 Wimbledon champion Roger Federer was seeded first, Andy Roddick was the second seed, Carlos Moyá was seed third and Tim Henman was seeded fourth. Martin Verkerk, the 2003 French Open runner-up, sustained a chest muscle injury that required him to withdraw from the tournament. Verkerk was replaced in the draw by Wayne Arthurs. World number three Guillermo Coria had a right shoulder tendinitis injury that made it sore and withdrew from the competition with his place taken by world number 40 Mariano Zabaleta. World number five and 2004 French Open champion Gastón Gaudio aggravated a post-traumatic right heel injury and right shoulder pain playing in the 2004 Cincinnati Masters and became the second Argentine to withdraw from the competition. His compatriot and world number 50 Agustín Calleri replaced him. David Nalbandian, the 2002 Wimbledon runner-up, withdrew with a strained left thigh and he was the third Argentine player to leave the event. Frédéric Niemeyer replaced him in the draw. A right wrist injury caused Irakli Labadze to withdraw from the tournament and Vladimir Voltchkov, a 2000 Wimbledon semi-finalist, replaced him.\nFederer was considered by the press as the strong favourite before the tournament. Henman, who had played in two previous Olympic Games, commented on his chances of victory, \"Federer goes into the event favourite, there's no doubt about that. And [Andy] Roddick will fancy his chances on a hard court. But I've beaten both of them this year so, if I can stay healthy and execute my intended game-plan, then there's a chance for me too. I'd be lying if I said I haven't dreamed of winning the gold medal.\" Roddick used his pre-tournament press conference to state that he wanted to medal at the Olympics and was concerned about his opponent in the first round.\nRanking points.\nThe breakdown of ranking points towards the ATP rankings is shown below:\nATP Entry Ranking points\nATP Champions Race points\nTournament summary.\nThe tournament was a single elimination competition with a bronze-medal match. The competition was played on hard courts as the best-of-three sets in every match until the gold medal game, which was held to the best-of-five sets.\nRound 1.\nThe draw for the first round of the championship was made on 12 August in Building H of the Athens 2004 Conference Room at ATHOC Headquarters. The first round of the competition, in which 64 players participated, took place from 15 to 16 August. Roddick took a 6–3, 7–6 straight sets victory over Flávio Saretta as wild card entrant Arthurs defeated Victor Hănescu 6–4, 7–6. Marcos Baghdatis, the 2003 ITF Junior World champion and a player who received funding from Olympic Solidarity, recovered from one set behind to win 5–7, 7–6, 7–5 over Grégory Carraz.A 6–3, 6–1 triumph came for the fifth seed Juan Carlos Ferrero against Hicham Arazi before Max Mirnyi caused an upset over the 11th seed Juan Ignacio Chela by taking a 3–6, 7–6, 6–4 win. Henman, a silver medallist in the 1996 Olympic doubles event, was the highest placed seed to lose in the first round when he lost to world number 27 Jiří Novák 6–3, 6–3 due to an inconsistent and error-prone play in a 68-minute match that took place in blustery weather.\nMarat Safin, a seeded player regarded as one who was in danger of elimination, won the first set of his match against Karol Kučera within 20 minutes. After Kučera played less cautiously in the second set, a break in the fifth game saw Safin claim a 6–0, 6–4 victory. Moyá, the 1998 French Open champion, took almost three hours and a total of five match points in the final two sets of his game against Thomas Enqvist to win 7–6, 6–7, 9–7. Paradorn Srichaphan, the 12th seed, was upset by Joachim Johansson in a 6–3, 6–3 straight sets defeat, and another upset victory occurred when the 13th seed Andrei Pavel lost to Ivo Karlović. Olivier Rochus came from a set behind Mark Philippoussis, who played in his first match in four weeks since after receiving artificial cartilage injections into his left knee, to claim a 3–6, 6–0, 6–1 victory. Philippoussis had tendinitis in his left knee that caused discomfort during the match and affected his movement. Federer took 1¾ hours to defeat Nikolay Davydenko 6–3, 5–7, 6–1. He received an official warning for ball abuse when he struck the ball onto the roof of the centre court in frustration over his play in the second set.\nRound 2.\nThe second round occurred on 17 August. Calleri withdrew at this stage of the tournament because of strain to his left abdominal, giving his opponent Igor Andreev a walkover into the third round and no players from Argentina left in the competition. Unseeded player and world number 49 Mardy Fish came from one set and a break point behind to claim a 4–6, 7–6 , 6–4 victory over former world number one Juan Carlos Ferrero. Fish said of his win, \"There were a lot of Spanish people out there cheering for him. So whoever was cheering for me, I was pointing at them.\" Another second round winner from the United States came in the form of Taylor Dent, who recovered from a slow start to defeat Dominik Hrbatý 7–6, 6–4.\nRoddick made 17 aces, 30 winners and 57 unforced errors in coming back from two match points behind and defeating the 2000 silver medallist Tommy Haas 6–4, 3–6, 9–7 in a 2-hour and 19 minute match. Federer was the highest ranked player to lose in the second round when world number 74 Tomáš Berdych beat him 4–6, 7–5, 7–5 due to a poor serve and a series of unforced errors. Berdych said of the victory, \"It was everything. This guy won Wimbledon and the Australian Open and now you are the player who beats him. Unbelievable.\" Moyá defeated Olivier Rochus 6–0, 7–6 and tenth seed Nicolás Massú won 7–6, 6–2 over Vince Spadea.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule was condensed compared to previous Games, taking only 8 days rather than 11 to complete."

It was Chile's first ever Olympic gold medal. Massú and González also won gold and bronze, respectively, in the singles competition. Germany won its third medal in four Games in the event. In the bronze medal match, Croatia's Mario Ančić and Ivan Ljubičić defeated India's Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes, 7–6(7–5), 4–6, 16–14. It was Croatia's first medal in men's doubles since 1992.\nThe tournament held between 15 and 21 August at the Olympic Tennis Centre in Athens, Greece. There were 30 pairs from 24 nations, with the Belarusian pair and one of the Swedish pairs not starting. For the first time since tennis returned in 1988, nations could enter more than one pair; the limit was now two pairs (four players).\nWorld No. 1 team Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan of the United States were the favorites for the title, but they were upset in the quarterfinals by González and Massú.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of men's doubles tennis. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program.

Woodbridge played in his fourth Games, with partner Wayne Arthurs (tennis)—still a formidable pairing, and the number two seed in Athens. The new top team, however, was the American pair of Bryan brothers, Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan. 2000 gold medalist Daniel Nestor of Canada returned with a new partner, Frédéric Niemeyer.\nPoland made its debut in the event. France made its ninth appearance in the event, matching the absent Great Britain for most of all nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. All matches except the final were best-of-three sets; the final was best-of-five. Tiebreaks were used for any set before the third (fifth in the final) that reached 6–6."

In the bronze medal match, Australia's Alicia Molik defeated Myskina, 6–3, 6–4. The medals were the first in women's singles for Belgium and Australia, and the first for France since 1924.

A women's event was held only once during the first three Games (only men's tennis was played in 1896 and 1904), but has been held at every Olympics for which there was a tennis tournament since 1908.

Williams had struggled with injuries before the Games, and came in as the #6 seed. Justine Henin of Belgium was the #1, with Amélie Mauresmo of France #2. Three Russian players rounded out the top 5: Anastasia Myskina, Dementieva, and Svetlana Kuznetsova.\nFormer World No. 1 Serena Williams had committed to playing this event, but withdrew one week before the tournament began due to a left knee injury.\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Puerto Rico, Serbia and Montenegro, and Ukraine each made their debut in the event.

        "text": "George Foreman's KO Boxing is a sports video game produced by Acclaim, featuring boxer George Foreman, released in 1992. Three years later, Acclaim released another game with Foreman: \"Foreman For Real\".\nGameplay.\nIn the 16-bit and Nintendo 8-bit versions, the player assumes the role of George Foreman, who, at 43 years old, is pursuing a quest to become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world by uniting the title belts of three fictional boxing circuits. Gameplay is almost identical to Beam's previous boxing game, Power Punch II: players are given the option to block the opponent's attempted punches, evade in two different directions, and throwing a wide variety of punches. Victory in a match can be won by knockout, technical knockout or by decision. A knockout requires a boxer to knock his opponent down four times in a three-round match; on the fourth knockdown, the downed boxer will fail to answer the 10-count. A technical knockout is awarded if a boxer is knocked down three times in a single round. If neither of these occur by the end of the third and final round, one boxer is declared the winner by a judge's decision, which is determined by each boxer's punches thrown and landed, knockdowns and total damage done.\nIn the 16-bit versions, a portrait of each boxer accompanies their energy meters. These portraits become progressively battered and bloody as the fighters take damage. A password system is used in career mode to save progress in the game in lieu of battery backup.\nVersions.\nThe two 16-bit versions of \"KO Boxing\" were developed by Beam Software for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Mega Drive, in 1992. Beam Software also developed the Game Boy and the Nintendo Entertainment System versions. The versions for Master System and Game Gear are different, and are based on the Master System version of \"Heavyweight Champ\".\nReception.\nThe game was poorly received. \"Mega\" said that \"the dire gameplay and abysmal graphics make this a game to avoid.\" \"Total!\" reviewer James Beaven went as so far to call it \"worse than wrestling games,\" panning its \"jerky\" animation and overwhelming difficulty: \"the only reason this scored anything was because you can move George a bit.\" Super Gamer magazine gave the game a review score of 46% stating \"George looks the business in the ring restrained beat-'em-up, but not enough moves.\" Super Play gave an overall score of 18%, they criticized the gameplay saying there is little opportunity to dodge the opponent's punches and the limited movement from the main character, they also gave criticism to the graphics calling it annoying and ropy concluding: \"Useless boxing game that’s a strong contender for the worst SNES release of all time.\" Nintendo Game Zone reviewed the SNES version and gave a score of 60%, they criticized the game's graphics being poor, the inability to move in the ring, lack luster gameplay and the lack of different moves concluding: \"Fun, Laughter, and great games play. All these things aren’t to be found in George Foreman's KO Boxing.\""

        "text": "The IIHF World Championship Division III are an annual sports event organized by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). It was the lowest level of the IIHF World Championships until the formation of Division IV for 2020.\nOrganization.\nWhen the IIHF reorganized its World Championships hierarchy in 2001, which included replacing \"pools\" with \"divisions\", nations outside of the top 40 were placed in Division II Qualification, trying to qualify for participation in the following year's Division II championship. This qualifier was not deemed a championship tournament by the IIHF, but was simply used to determine the teams that would replace the two teams relegated out of the Division II championship. The bottom two nations from the 2000 Pool D championship, Luxembourg and Turkey, had been relegated and were slated to compete in the 2001 Division II Qualification, against other nations attempting to reach the 2002 Division II championship. When no other nations submitted their names to enter the 2001 qualifier, there was no need for Luxembourg and Turkey to meet, and both were promoted to Division II for 2002. Three teams met in the last, 2002, Division II Qualification.\nIn 2003, the Division II Qualification was officially replaced by the Division III Championship, with the winner of the tournament now being declared a champion, and the top two finishers still earning promotion to the following year's Division II Championship, to be replaced in Division III by the two teams relegated down from Division II.\nIn 2011, the IIHF allowed eight teams, rather than the previous year's six, to compete. The teams were divided into two groups, with the winner of each group declared co-champion and promoted to the following year's Division II tournament. While Division III returned to a six team competition in 2012, reorganization of the Division II system meant that only the champion of Division III was promoted, replacing the single team from Division II Group B that was relegated.\nIn 2013, the IIHF again had eight teams interested in contesting the Division III Championship. The decision was made to hold a four team qualifier, with the bottom two teams from 2012 plus two new invitees, to determine two teams to qualify for that year's Division III Championship. As with the earlier Division II Qualifications, the 2013 Division III Qualification was not a championship. The Division III Championship did not have this preliminary qualifier after the 2013 event.\nIn 2018, the IIHF reintroduced the Division III Qualification, but used it to determine a single team that would be invited to compete in the following year's Division III Championship, replacing the team relegated out of Division III – a variation from the 2013 Division III Qualification. This process was repeated in 2019.\nResults.\nFrom 2003 until 2011, the Division III champion and the second-place finisher were promoted to Division II, replacing the two teams from Division II that were relegated to the Division III. From 2012 until 2017, only the Division III champion was promoted, to Division II Group B. From 2003 to 2010, and again from 2012 to 2016, no teams were relegated from Division III; the 2012 exception, noted above, was the IIHF holding a four team qualifier with the previous year's bottom two teams and two new invitees. By 2017, the demand from teams wishing to compete had grown to the point where the bottom team of 2017 was relegated to the newly introduced 2018 Division III Qualification, where the top qualifier earned a spot in the following year's Division III championship. The Division III Qualification was expanded in 2019, and interest had grown enough that a new Division IV Championship, rather than qualifiers, was added for 2020. In addition, the Division III Championship was expanded to two groups for 2020.\nPool D.\nChampions (1987–2000).\n^ – In 1992, 1994, and 1995, there was no Pool D. However, Pool C was divided in two tiers where the winner of 'C2' was promoted to 'C1', essentially making C2 the same as D. Accordingly, the winners (Spain, Estonia and Croatia) are listed here."

He reached the second world semi-final of his career at the 2023 World Snooker Championship, but lost 15–17 to Mark Selby.\nA prolific break-builder, Allen has compiled more than 600 century breaks in professional competition. He has also made three maximum breaks, achieving his first in the 2016 UK Championship, the second in the 2021 Northern Ireland Open qualifying round, and the third during the 2024 Masters.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nAt a young age, Allen considered a career in football, having trials with Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest before concentrating on snooker. Playing out of the Fountain Club in Antrim, he was Northern Ireland U14 champion in 2000, the U16 champion in 2001, before winning the Irish U16, U18 and U19 titles in one weekend in 2002, becoming the first player to win all three tournaments. By the age of 16 he had recorded his first maximum break and was a winner of the Golden Waistcoat, a tournament for the best U19 players from around the world.\nHe began his professional career by playing Challenge Tour in 2003, at the time the second-level professional tour. Before entering the Main Tour for the 2005–06 season, Allen won the European Championship and the IBSF World Championship, plus Northern Ireland Championship at under-14, under-16, and under-19 levels. His early career was aided by National Lottery funding.\nBy chance, an invitational Northern Ireland Trophy was staged shortly after Allen turned professional. As a local player, he was invited and made an immediate impact, defeating Steve Davis and John Higgins to reach the quarter-finals, before losing to Stephen Hendry. In his first year on the tour, he reached the last 32 of the 2005 UK Championship and the 2006 Welsh Open, losing 2–5 to the then World Champion Shaun Murphy after leading 2–0. He also got to the final qualifying round of the 2006 World Championship, losing 7–10 to Andy Hicks, after leading 7–4.\nIn March 2007 he qualified for the World Championship for the first time, winning three matches, culminating in a 10–4 win over Robert Milkins. In April 2007 he beat former world champion Ken Doherty 10–7 in the first round held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, but lost to Matthew Stevens 9–13 in the second round. This was his first run to the last 16 of a tournament and helped him into the top 32 of the rankings (at no. 29).\nIn the 2007 Grand Prix, in a match with Ken Doherty, he was involved in an incident that led to his opponent branding him \"a disgrace\". Unhappy that the black would not go back on its spot after potting it, Allen struck the side cushion of the table with his fist. The referee told him that he would be warned if he did that again. Allen was not warned, and ended up winning the match. Doherty said, \"He was a disgrace. For such a relative newcomer to the pro game, he's got a serious attitude problem\". Allen later commented: \"It was entirely my own fault and if there are going to be any repercussions then so be it.\" Allen did not reach the knockout stage of the tournament.\nIn the 2007 Northern Ireland Trophy he beat Graeme Dott and Ryan Day, 5–3 in each case, to reach his first ever quarter-final. There he defeated Gerard Greene 5–3 to reach the semi-final, where he lost 3–6 to Fergal O'Brien. In the following UK Championship he defeated Stephen Hendry in the last 32. He opened his last-16 match against Mark Williams with two centuries in the first three frames, building a 5–1 lead, but Williams fought back and he lost 5–9. He then reached the quarter-finals in the 2008 China Open before losing to Shaun Murphy. At the 2008 World Championship he led Stephen Hendry 6–3, 7–4 and 9–7 before losing 9–10. However, first-round defeats for all his rivals for a top-16 place ensured that he finished the season at number 16 in the rankings.\n2009–2011 seasons.\nAfter a consistent season, Allen was back at the Crucible the following year where he beat Martin Gould in his opening match. He faced Ronnie O'Sullivan in the second round; confident and unaffected by his opponent's reputation, Allen beat the defending champion 13–11 for a quarter-final place in the 2009 World Championship. He then defeated Ryan Day by the same scoreline to reach the semi-finals, where he lost 13–17 to John Higgins, despite making a determined fightback from 3–13 down. Soon after his run in the World Championship, Allen won his first professional tournament, the 2009 Jiangsu Classic beating home favourite Ding Junhui 6–0 in the final.\nDuring the 2010 Masters, Allen beat the World Champion, John Higgins, by 6–3 in the last 16, but lost 5–6 to eventual champion Mark Selby in the quarter-finals.\nOn the first day of the 2010 World Championship on 17 April 2010, Allen came close to recording his first ever maximum break in his first round match against Tom Ford after potting 15 reds with blacks, and the yellow, before breaking down on the green. Five days later, Allen made the first 146 break in World Championship history, and the second of his career after defeating Mark Davis 13–5 in the second round. He was defeated 12–13 in the quarter-final by Graeme Dott, having led 12–10.\nAt the 2010 UK Championship, Allen reached the semi-finals for the first time, where he was beaten 9–5 by eventual champion John Higgins. In the Masters, Allen again reached the semi-finals, and led Marco Fu 4–1 before Fu reeled off five frames in a row to win 6–4. At the 2011 World Championship, Allen entered as the 11th seed and played Matthew Stevens in the first round, recovering from 9–6 down and seeing Stevens miss a pot on the final pink to win the match 10–7, before winning 10–9. In the second round, Allen defeated Barry Hawkins 13–12. He reached the quarter-finals for the second year in a row but lost to Mark Williams 5–13.\n2011/2012 season.\nThe season began with Allen ranked world number 12 and he began it at the inaugural Australian Goldfields Open, where he beat Ryan Day and Marcus Campbell. Into the quarter finals, Allen was beaten by his rival Stuart Bingham 5–3. The next ranking event was the Shanghai Masters where Allen reached the second round and held a 4–2 advantage over Shaun Murphy before losing the next 3 frames and being edged out of the match 5–4. His steady start to the season meant that he maintained his world ranking of 12 after the first cut-off point.\nAllen made it to his first ranking event final at the 2011 UK Championship by beating Adrian Gunnell, Ali Carter, Marco Fu and Ricky Walden.&lt;ref name=\"2011/12\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was his first success in a ranking event semi-final, after having lost in all five prior attempts. In the final he played Judd Trump with whom he held a 2–1 advantage in the previous meetings between the pair. Allen opened up a 3–1 lead early in the best of 19 frames match, but subsequently lost the next seven frames to trail 3–8. However, such a deficit brought out the best in Allen as he won five of the next six frames, which included three centuries. The comeback was not quite completed though, as Trump secured the frame he required to take an 8–10 victory. Allen said after the final, \"I knew it was going to be hard the way he was playing, he scores so heavy and so quickly and I didn't feel I was playing too bad but Judd played so well and it was hard to compete.\" Allen made five centuries during the tournament, the most of anyone in the event.\nAllen lost the last four frames in the first round of the Masters to Neil Robertson having led 3–2 and stated afterwards that he had \"completely lost interest\" in the match. He accused the Australian of employing slow tactics and said that at times he didn't want to watch him play. He then exited the German Masters in the second round and lost to Shaun Murphy in the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open.\nIn March, Allen won his first ever ranking event as he captured the World Open title in Haikou, China. He beat qualifier Jimmy Robertson in the first round, before exacting revenge over Judd Trump for his defeat in York, by coming back from 0–3 down to triumph 5–4. He comfortably beat Mark King 5–1 in the quarter-finals, before producing another comeback from 2–5 down against world number 1 Mark Selby to win 6–5 and reach his second ranking final of the season. Allen played Stephen Lee in the final and dominated the encounter from start to finish as he won by 10 frames to 1. His season finished in disappointment, however, as he exited both the China Open and World Championship in the first round, to end the year where he started it, ranked world number 12.\n2012/2013 season.\nAllen began the season with second round losses to Mark Williams at the Wuxi Classic and Judd Trump in the Shanghai Masters.&lt;ref name=\"2012/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His first title of the year soon followed at the minor-ranking Antwerp Open, by making three centuries in a 4–1 win over Mark Selby in the final. Allen then beat Robert Milkins and Cao Yupeng both 6–2 in the inaugural International Championship, before being edged out 5–6 by Trump in the quarter-finals. Marco Fu at the UK Championship beat Allen 6–3. At the Masters Allen came past Mark Davis 6–2, but was then narrowly beaten 5–6 by Neil Robertson in a high-quality encounter in the quarter-finals. At the Snooker Shoot-Out, the tournament where each match is decided by a 10-minute frame, Allen won through to the final where he lost to Martin Gould. He suffered successive second round defeats at the German Masters and the Welsh Open to Barry Hawkins and Ding Junhui respectively, before he travelled to China in an attempt to defend his World Open title from 2012. Allen comfortably won every match he played at the event as he beat Ryan Day 5–2, Robert Milkins 5–2, Ricky Walden 5–1, John Higgins 6–2 and Matthew Stevens 10–4 in the final to capture his second ranking title. Allen's Antwerp Open win from earlier in the season helped him finish eighth on the Players Tour Championship Order of Merit to qualify for the Finals where he lost 3–4 in the quarter-finals to Ding, who made a 147 and two further centuries during the match. Robertson beat Allen 5–1 in the second round of the China Open, and then Allen was the victim of a first round shock at the World Championship for a second year in a row as he lost to world number 30 Mark King 8–10, having led 8–6. Despite this, he climbed five spots in the rankings during the year to finish it ranked world number seven.\n2013/2014 season.\nAfter losing in the first round of the opening two ranking events of the year, Allen won the minor-ranking Ruhr Open in Mülheim, Germany, by beating Ding Junhui 4–1 in the final.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also won the next European Tour event, the Kay Suzanne Memorial Cup by battling past former world champions Neil Robertson and Graeme Dott in the quarter-finals and semis respectively. He beat Judd Trump 4–1 in the final to become the first player to win back-to-back events since they were introduced in 2010. In the last 16 of the UK Championship, Allen and Judd Trump both struggled for consistency during their match, with Allen giving Trump a hug when the pair missed a succession of easy balls. Allen went on to win 6–4 to reach his first major quarter-final of the season, where he lost 6–2 to Ricky Walden. Allen came close to recording a hat-trick of World Open titles as he won through to the semi-finals, but was beaten 6–4 by Shaun Murphy. His two titles earlier in the season meant Allen was the number one seed for the PTC Finals where he lost in the quarter-finals 4–2 against Gerard Greene. Allen was 9–7 behind against Neil Robertson after the second session of his last 16 match at the World Championship and lost all four frames in the next session to be defeated 13–7. Afterwards, Allen tipped Robertson for the title saying he had faced perfect snooker from the Australian.\n2014/2015 season.\nIn August 2014, he reached the final of the Riga Open but lost 4–3 to Mark Selby. Two weeks later Allen won the Paul Hunter Classic defeating Judd Trump 4–2 in the final. He advanced to the final of the Shanghai Masters where he was beaten 10–3 by Stuart Bingham. At the International Championship, Allen led Mark Williams 7–4 by producing some of his best snooker which included a total of eight breaks above 50. However, Williams fought back to lead 8–7 before Allen came from 71–0 down and requiring two snookers to steal the next frame 73–71. Williams missed a tricky final red in the decider to allow Allen in to reach the final. In this match with Ricky Walden, there were never more than two frames between the players until from 7–7 Walden raced away to take the last three frames and condemn Allen to a second ranking event final defeat of the season. Despite taking a 3–0 lead over Rod Lawler with two centuries, Allen was knocked out 6–4 in the third round of the UK Championship.\nHe eliminated John Higgins and Joe Perry both 6–4 to play in the semi-finals of the Masters for the second time. Allen won the opening two frames against Shaun Murphy, but then lost six frames in a row. The rest of the season would prove to be disappointing for Allen as he couldn't advance beyond the last 16 of any event and after he lost the last five frames against Barry Hawkins in the second round of the World Championship to be beaten 13–11, he stated that the match had summed up his year as he was great in patches but overall came up short. He had not been coached by Terry Griffiths this season and Allen said that he was hopeful his form would improve next year by working with him again.\n2015/2016 season.\nAllen reached the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters with a 5–1 victory over Mark Davis, but was beaten 6–1 by Kyren Wilson. In the quarter-finals of the International Championship he compiled a 118 break to send the match into a deciding frame, but Thepchaiya Un-Nooh won it. Allen swept to the final of the Bulgarian Open by whitewashing Mark Williams 4–0 and did not drop a frame against Ryan Day either as he took home the title, his first in 15 months. The win qualified Allen for the Champion of Champions and he knocked out Barry Hawkins, Stephen Maguire and Wilson to reach another final, where he lost 10–5 to Neil Robertson. Robertson was also the victor when the pair met in the semi-finals of the Welsh Open, this time 6–4.\nAllen came from 4–2 down against Shaun Murphy to win 6–4 and reach his first ranking event final of the season at the PTC Finals. He was 3–1 down to Ricky Walden, but a crucial run of six successive frames would be key as Allen won 10–6. He became the first Northern Irishman to win a ranking event in the UK since Dennis Taylor won the world title in 1985. Allen lost the opening seven frames against Kyren Wilson in the second round of the World Championship and was also 11–5 behind. He closed the gap to 11–9, but had left himself too much to do as he lost 13–9. Allen called the season a waste as he had not become the world champion.\n2016/2017 season.\nAllen lost in the last 16 of the Paul Hunter Classic and the European Masters 4–3 to Thepchaiya Un-Nooh and 4–2 to Ronnie O'Sullivan respectively. He made three centuries to eliminate Mark Selby 6–5 at the inaugural China Championship 5–4, but was then heavily beaten 9–3 by John Higgins. A week later he defeated Selby by the same scoreline and stage at the Champion of Champions, before losing 6–2 to O'Sullivan.\nAllen's only ranking event quarter-final this season came at his home event the Northern Ireland Open, but he lost 5–2 to Anthony Hamilton. He made the first 147 of his career during his 6–4 win over Rod Lawler in the second round of the UK Championship and then recovered from 4–0 down to eliminate Ryan Day 6–5. Allen was knocked out 6–3 by John Higgins in the fourth round, losing the final four frames of the match. He exacted some revenge by edging out Higgins 6–5 in the opening round of the Masters, before being defeated 6–2 by Marco Fu. He met Higgins again in the second round of the World Championship and, though Allen made four centuries and seven other breaks above 50, he was beaten 13–9.\n2017/2018 season.\nAllen´s first tournament where he played was International Championship. He´s got to final on first try, but lost to Mark Selby 7-10. This was his first and last participation in a ranking final at the same time in this season. Later he added a semi-final in World open and other quarter-final in European Masters.\nHowever, Allen succeeded in the Masters beating Luca Brecel, Ronnie O'Sullivan, John Higgins and runner-up Kyren Wilson 10-7. This was the only tournament victory for Allen in this season. In World championship, he finished in last 8. His opponent in quarter-final was Kyren Wilson again, but this time Allen was beaten 6-13 by him.\n2018/2019 season.\nAlthough Allen didn't succeed in the final of International championship in previous season, this time he did. In the final, he met with Neil Robertson and beat him comfortably 10-5 and also made a highest break (146). But after this triumph followed a few unsatisfactory results. Despite this, Allen reached UK Championship final after a won decider in semi-final against Stuart Bingham at the start of December. His opponent was a defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan, who won over Allen 10-6.\nJust after UK championship Allen added his 5th ranking victory by winning last tournament in year 2018 Scottish open by defeating Shaun Murphy in the final.\nBut in the second half of the season, Allen wasn't able to get further than semi-final. Allen suffered a failure in World championship, because he lost in first round against Zhou Yuelong.\nDespite the negative outcomes, he won more than one ranking tournament in his career for the first time and reached his highest ranking, fifth, in March 2019.\n2019/2020 season.\nAllen could not reach a final in the first half of the season, he lost in all six semi-finals which he reached. In International Championship and Shanghai Masters Allen lost against Shaun Murphy, in English open against Mark Selby and in Champion of champions lost to Judd Trump. In the UK Championship, he suffered a whitewash from Stephen Maguire. Allen's attempt to regain his Scottish open title in 2018 ended in the decider of the semi-final match against Jack Lisowski. At the World Championship Allen equalled the record of making 5 centuries in a first round match against qualifier Jamie Clarke; however, he went on to lose the match against the Welsh number 89 - the lowest ranked player in the tournament- 8-10. He ended the season where he finished the last one, ranked number 5.\n2020/2021 season.\nAllen's most notable achievement during the 2020/2021 season was winning the 2020 Champion of Champions. He defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan in a contentious quarter-final that saw O'Sullivan accusing Allen of deliberately standing in his line of sight and Allen accusing O'Sullivan of being a 'bully'. Allen went on to defeat Judd Trump in the semi-finals and Neil Robertson 10–6 in the final.\n2021/2022 season.\nIn the 2021/2022 season, Allen won his first Northern Ireland Open title, coming from 6–8 behind in the final to defeat John Higgins 9–8. Earlier in the tournament, in his qualifying round match against Si Jiahui, he made the second maximum break of his professional career.\n2022/2023 season.\nIn this phenomenal season for Allen, he won three ranking events and also reached a further final and a semifinal.\nHe won the UK Championship 2022 10–7 against Ding Junhui, coming back from 1–6 behind.\nRivalry.\nAllen has had a rivalry with Stuart Bingham. After Bingham squandered a 12–9 lead in the second round of the 2011 World Snooker Championship to lose 13–12 against Ding Junhui, Allen stated that Bingham had \"no bottle\" and admitted that there was history between the players and that they did not get on. Bingham responded by calling Allen an idiot and the tension between the two was clearly high as they were drawn to play each other in the second round of the 2011 Australian Goldfields Open. Before the match, Bingham said that he couldn't wait to play and that he had been waiting for it for a long time. He also stated that he didn't care what Allen thought and it would give him more pleasure to beat him. Bingham fulfilled his pre-match words by defeating Allen 5–3 and also went on to win the tournament by coming back from 8–5 down to beat Mark Williams 9–8 in the final.\nWhen the draw for the 2011 UK Championship was made it revealed that there was a potential quarter-final clash between the two. Anticipating the meeting, Bingham said that the \"feud was not over\" and that he would be staying away from Allen and not be speaking to him until they next played. The match-up was avoided, however, when Bingham lost in the first round to Marco Fu. Allen announced before the start of the 2013 World Championship that there was no problem between himself and Bingham since Bingham had proved him wrong by winning tournaments, and the two have had drinks and dinner together. After Bingham won the 2015 World Championship he said \"Thanks to Mark Allen. He said I had no bottle and since then things have changed\".\nAllen also has a rivalry with Mark Joyce and has made no secret of his dislike for him, stating that: \"I don't like Mark Joyce, basically he is a dick, on and off the table, I doubt even his mum likes him.\" He went on to accuse Joyce of gamesmanship during their match at the 2016 Northern Irish Open.\nControversy.\nIn a post-match press conference after his first round win in the 2011 UK Championship, Allen called for the chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), Barry Hearn, to resign. Allen's reasoning for this was based upon his belief that Hearn had promised not to alter the structure of any of the major snooker tournaments in the calendar (the World Snooker Championships, the UK Championships and the Masters) when he was appointed chairman in June 2010, whereas in fact the UK Championship had seen matches decided on a best-of-11-frames basis, rather than the best-of-17-frames used in previous years. Allen also stated his perception that the crowd atmosphere within snooker was turning into that of one usually associated with darts and that the tradition of snooker was \"going to pot\". Allen then swore when talking about Hearn at a press conference.\nThe WPBSA announced that Allen would be facing a disciplinary committee for swearing when talking about Hearn and that he could be charged with bringing the game into disrepute. Hearn himself responded by saying he was \"far too busy to worry about silly little boys making silly little comments\". Upon learning that Hearn had been on holiday for the entirety of the event, Allen said it was a \"joke\" and only confirmed the views which he had expressed earlier in the week. The pair held a meeting in January 2012, to settle their differences ahead of the forthcoming Masters tournament. Hearn said after the meeting that the way he was running the game may not suit everyone, but his concern was the game of snooker in general. Hearn added: \"Mark's prize money this year is probably double what he's earned in the last couple of years so I must be doing something right. We had a very frank and friendly exchange of views and in the end I think he saw my point of view, but time will tell.\" Allen was fined £250 for his actions by the WPBSA later in the month.\nJust two months later while playing in the World Open in Haikou, China, Allen described the conditions on his Twitter page as \"horrendous\", following up with: \"Journey a nightmare. People are ignorant. Place stinks. Arena's rubbish, tables poor, food is horrendous. Other than that I love China\", although this tweet was later deleted. Answering critics of that particular tweet, he said they should \"get a life\". World Snooker described his remarks as very disappointing. It was later revealed that Allen was fined £1,000 for his criticism and he went on to close his Twitter account in April. He later reopened it and used it for some time but proceeded to close it again for most of 2020, citing repeat issues of abuse and trolling that have disrupted his game. As of late 2020, it has since been reopened.\nFollowing his defeat at the 2012 World Snooker Championship to Chinese qualifier Cao Yupeng, he openly accused his opponent of cheating and unsporting behaviour for not owning up to what he perceived to be a foul. Allen attributed the deception to his perceived cultural differences between British and Chinese players, purportedly with incidents involving Chinese professional Liang Wenbo and Hong Kong's Marco Fu. Barry Hearn confirmed that Allen would once again face a disciplinary process and said that the player's actions had left him \"speechless\". Allen was fined a total of £11,000 and warned he would be suspended from the tour for three months if he breached the rules again in the following six months. He was also required to undergo media training.\nPrior to the commencement of the 2013 World Snooker Championship, Allen renewed his criticisms of Barry Hearn. Allen voiced concerns that the World Snooker Tour's increasing emphasis on events in China was pricing players out of competing, pointing out that since Hearn took over the running of the game players now have to pay for their own flights, which can incur extra expenses of £10,000–£15,000 per season. Allen, who earned £278,000 over the course of the previous two years, further added he did not believe he was being fairly compensated for his services.\nAt the 2019 World Grand Prix, he conceded the match against Ali Carter in the fifth frame with 11 reds on the table after missing the yellow.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2005, Allen began a relationship with women's world snooker champion Reanne Evans. They had a daughter, Lauren Sophie, born in May 2006, when both parents were 20 years old. Evans and Allen ended their relationship in 2008. Following his breakup with Evans, Allen fell into a deep depression and had periods where he did not leave his home. Allen and Evans have continued to be involved in legal disputes over child maintenance payments. In 2022, Allen noted that he no longer sees Lauren, but said \"I still think about her all the time\".\nAllen met Kyla McGuigan in 2011 and the couple married on 10 May 2013. Kyla McGuigan's son from a previous relationship, Robbie McGuigan, became a noted amateur snooker player, winning under-16 and under-21 tournaments at an early age and achieving a 147 break in 2018 at age 13. Robbie McGuigan subsequently won the Northern Ireland Amateur Snooker Championship for three consecutive years from 2021–23. Allen and Kyla McGuigan had a daughter, Harleigh, born in 2017, but by May 2020 they had separated and were in the process of divorcing. In May 2021, Allen declared himself bankrupt. In 2022, after his divorce had been finalised, he became engaged to Aideen Cassidy, whom he met through mutual friends and got to know on long walks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAllen is partially colour blind and sometimes has difficulty distinguishing between the red and brown balls. As his career progressed, he gained significant weight. By the 2022 World Snooker Championship, he weighed 19 stone (approx. 120 kg). Following an hour-long conversation with Ronnie O'Sullivan in a Sheffield hotel room after O'Sullivan had defeated him 13–4 in the second round of the tournament, Allen lost five stone (approx. 32 kg) in under five months. \nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Allen spent three to four hours a day delivering groceries and prescription medications to vulnerable people in Antrim. In 2024, he launched the Mark Allen Foundation, a charity organisation helping local people in need through fundraisers."

The Cup is the most famous and most prestigious regatta and \"Match Race\" in the sport of sailing.\nAs per the Deed of Gift of the America's Cup the yacht club that holds the Cup is the one that chooses the location for the next challenge to take place. \"Alinghi\", the syndicate representing the Société Nautique de Genève, the winners of the thirty-first edition, are based in Switzerland which is a landlocked country, so \"Alinghi\" put the hosting rights out to a competitive bid process. During a preliminary selection the bids of Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Porto Cervo and Elba were eliminated. The four finalists were Cascais (near Lisbon), Marseille, Naples (ITA) and Valencia. On November 27, 2003, it was announced that the venue would be Valencia, Spain. A new building, \"Veles e Vents\" designed by David Chipperfield, was built in the harbour of Valencia to house the central base for all the America's Cup teams.\nBy winning the 32nd America's Cup, \"Alinghi\" changed what seemed to have become a tradition: that the winner of race three goes on to win the match. Emirates Team New Zealand, despite winning the third heat, was not able to capture the Cup. The score of the 32nd America's Cup has also differentiated the match from previous editions.

These events featured fleet and match racing between America's Cup class yachts representing the syndicates that were vying for selection as challenger for the America's Cup in 2007. Points were awarded for each Act, and the team with the highest score at the end of the year is declared the ACC (America's Cup Class) Champion for that year. In 2004, Emirates Team New Zealand narrowly won over second place American challenger BMW Oracle Racing and third place Swiss defender Team Alinghi.\nThe schedule of Acts in 2005 included Acts 4 and 5 in Valencia (June 16-June 26), Acts 6 and 7 in Malmö, Sweden (August 25-September 4) and Acts 8 and 9 in Trapani, Italy (September 29-October 9).\n2007 America's Cup program and results.\nAll races were run on a windward-leeward course consisting of four legs with legs 1 and 4 being in length, and legs 2 and 3 being for a total of .\nIn the results table below, the team entering the starting area from the side (i.e. entering from the right-hand side on starboard tack) has a slight advantage.

It has since regularly competed in European Cricket Council tournaments, usually in the lower divisions, and also often plays bilateral series against other European sides.\nHistory.\nHaving been played by English gardeners, tradesmen and the expat staff of banks working in Vienna at the end of the 19th century - at which time the Vienna Cricket and Football-Club was founded, cricket disappeared in Austria until after the Second World War, when it was played by British occupying troops on a recreational basis.\nThe modern era as such began in May 1975, when the Australian Kerry Tattersall introduced the game to his pupils at the Vienna Handelsakademie (commercial academy) where he was teaching English, and formed the Vienna Cricket Club. Early opponents came from the United Nations (United Nations CC) and diplomatic services (Five Continents CC) and these founder clubs survive to this day.\nCricket remains predominantly Viennese-based with eleven of the 18 member clubs being based in Vienna.

        "text": "Brett Steven Maher (born 17 April 1973) is an Australian retired professional basketball player. He played his entire seventeen-year career for his hometown Adelaide 36ers in the National Basketball League (NBL) from 1992 to 2009. Maher also represented Australia at the 1996, 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympic Games, as well as at the 1998 FIBA World Championship.\nMaher gained his highest international basketball honour when he captained the Boomers at the 2001 Goodwill Games in Brisbane.\nProfessional career.\nBorn in Adelaide, South Australia, Maher was spotted playing for the Sturt Sabres in the Australian Basketball Association where his outstanding form saw him earn a contract with the Adelaide 36ers. He took up an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship between 1989 and 1991. Maher played 526 games for the 36ers between 1992 and 2009, averaging 16.9 points, 4.2 assists and 4.3 rebounds per game.\nBy 1994, Maher was regarded as one of the NBL's best guards and the 36ers would make its first Grand Final in eight years. Unfortunately for Maher and the 36ers they were defeated 2–0 in the Grand Final series by the North Melbourne Giants. He averaged 16.5 points, 5.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists over the series while averaging 13.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists over the season.\nBrett Maher took over from Mark Davis as captain of the 36ers at the start of the 1997 NBL season. Maher played an integral role in three of the four Adelaide 36ers NBL championships (1998, 1998–99 and 2001–02) and has also been the 36ers club MVP on six occasions. He was selected in 4 NBL All-Star Games (1996, 1997, 2005 and 2006) and he has been named in the All-NBL First Team in 2000 and 2003, All-NBL Second Team in 1997, 1998 and All-NBL Third Team in 1999, 2002. He also won the Larry Sengstock Medal for being the Grand Final MVP in 1999 and 2002. Maher is one of only two players to ever win the NBL Grand Final MVP twice, the other being Ricky Grace of the Perth Wildcats who won the award in 1990 and 1993.\nOn 7 February 2009 in front of a sellout crowd in excess of 8,000, the main court of The Dome was renamed The Brett Maher Court in honor of Maher who was playing his last home game before retiring from the NBL at the end of the 2008-09 season. The court that now bears his name is the only home court that Maher ever played on during his NBL career as the 36ers had moved to the then named Clipsal Powerhouse from their former home at the Apollo Stadium the same year that Maher started with the club. Maher has also been honored as one of only four players to have their number retired by the Adelaide 36ers.\nBrett Maher retired as the Adelaide 36ers all-time leader in: games played (525), points (8,941), field goals (3,140), field goals attempted (7,072), three points made (1,162), three-point attempts (2,835), assists (2,267) and steals (703). He is one of only four players to have won 3 or more NBL championships with the 36ers alongside Mark Davis, Paul Rees and Rupert Sapwell, and one of only two 36ers championship winning captains along with American import Bill Jones who captained the club to its first title in 1986.\nInternational career.\nDuring his career Maher also won selection for the Australian Boomers at the 1998 FIBA World Championship where the team finished in 9th place. He also represented Australia at the 1996, 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympic Games helping the Boomers to 4th in Atlanta and Sydney and 9th place in Athens. In all, Maher played over 100 games for the Boomers and had the honor of captaining his country at the 2001 Goodwill Games.\nMedia work.\nSince retiring, Maher also co-hosted an Internet Television show on Australia Live TV about basketball with former 36ers championship winning teammate Kevin Brooks called Inside the Game. He also served as the expert local analyst for 36ers home games televised on One HD and Network Ten.\nMaher was named as the Adelaide 36ers Community Services Manager before the start of the 2013–14 NBL season."

        "text": "The 2006 World Snooker Championship (officially the 2006 888.com World Snooker Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that was held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, the 38th consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship was staged at the venue. It started on 15 April 2006 and was scheduled to finish on 1 May 2006, but continued into the early hours of 2 May. The sixth and final ranking tournament of the 2005–06 snooker season, it was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association and sponsored for the first time by online casino 888.com. The total prize fund was £896,240, of which the winner received £200,000.\nThe qualifying rounds took place from 8 to 13 January and from 14 to 15 March 2006 at Pontin's, in Prestatyn, Wales. The top 16 players from the snooker world rankings and the 16 successful qualifiers reached the tournament's main stage at the Crucible. Shaun Murphy was the defending champion, having defeated Matthew Stevens 18–16 in the 2005 final. He lost in the quarter-finals against eventual runner-up Peter Ebdon and became another world champion who fell to the Crucible curse and could not defend his first world title.\nBarry Hawkins featured at the main stage for the first time, meaning it was the first time there was only one debutant at the Crucible. Graeme Dott defeated Ebdon 18–14 in the final, which surpassed the 1985 final between Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis as the latest finish ending at 12:52 a.m. BST, although it was not the longest-lasting ever. A total of 46 century breaks were compiled during the event's main stage. Another 52 century breaks were made during the qualifying rounds.\nOverview.\nThe first World Snooker Championship final took place in 1927 at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England, and was won by Joe Davis. Since 1977 the tournament has been held annually at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The 2006 event marked the 30th consecutive year that the tournament was held at the Crucible, and the 38th successive year that the World Championship was contested through the modern knockout format. Scottish player Stephen Hendry had been the most successful participant at the World Championship in the modern era, having won the title seven times. English player Shaun Murphy won his first world title at the 2005 championship, defeating Welsh player Matthew Stevens 18–16 in the final, for which he received a £250,000 top prize from a total prize fund of £1,121,800.\nOrganised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the 2006 tournament was sponsored by online casino 888.com. Following new EU and UK legislation banning tobacco advertising, it could not be sponsored by Embassy as had been the case for the previous three decades. In January 2006 World Snooker – the sport's governing body – announced that the online casino 888.com would be the new sponsors of the event in the next five years. However, this decision led to conflict with some players who lost income from their own personal sponsors (seen on their waistcoats), who are rival firms of 888.com. Concerns were expressed among the sport's elite at the decrease in prize money and also in the number of ranking events (down to six for the 2005/06 season) since the loss of tobacco sponsorship. For the 2006 World Championship the winner's cheque was down 20% on what it was in 2005.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played between 15 and 20 April as the best of 19 frames. The defending champion, Shaun Murphy, was afflicted with a chest infection, but managed to defeat Thai player James Wattana 10–4. Three former world champions lost their first round matches. In his match against seven-time champion Stephen Hendry, Nigel Bond the for what would have been a win in the , but the dropped in the right-hand , which meant that the frame was tied at 48–48 due to the seven . Bond still won the match on the . This was the first time in the history of the World Championship that a match was decided on a re-spotted black. John Parrott, the 1991 champion, faced Graeme Dott, 2004 runner-up. Dott gained a 5–0 advantage, with breaks of 98, 50, 56, 80 and 57 giving him a 7–2 lead at the end of the first , and Parrott only managed to put another one on the board after the ressumption, meaning that Dott advanced into the second round with a 10–3 result. \"These days I can't sustain my concentration for long periods and if I'm on a break of 40 or 50 I know a bad is coming up. I just throw people a lifeline\", said Parrott afterwards. John Higgins, winner in 1998 and champion of the 2005 Grand Prix and 2006 Masters during the season, lost 4–10 against qualifier Mark Selby, in a repeat of a previous year first-round match which had gone the other way. Selby, playing at the Crucible only for the second time in his career, clinched victory with a 110, his second century break of the match.\nNeil Robertson also won at the Crucible for the first time. His rival, Paul Hunter, was playing in pain from chemotherapy treatment for a rare form of stomach cancer. \"I didn't think I would make it here because I was in a pretty bad way\", said Hunter. The first four frames were shared, but Robertson managed to put himself 7–2 ahead at the end of the first session. The encounter, which ended with a 10–5 victory for him, would turn out to be the last professional match for Hunter, who died later that year aged 27. Six-time runner-up Jimmy White went into the second session with a three-frame deficit against David Gray, and lost two of the first three frames of the last session on the black ball. Gray won the match 10–5, and it was White's last appearance in the televised stage of the World Championship. Six-time champion Steve Davis, who was 48, built in the first session a four-frame cushion against qualifier and 1995 semi-finalist Andy Hicks. Although Hicks managed to cut the deficit by half when the match resumed, Davis then won four frames on the trot to secure victory. \"I was even able to laugh at some of the shots I missed and the crowd were laughing too\", he commented after the game. Peter Ebdon, the 2002 champion, faced qualifier Michael Holt, who had made his debut at the Crucible the previous year. Breaks of 94, 87 and 66 helped Ebdon to a 4–0 lead, but Holt then reduced the disadvantage to only one frame with three on the trot, making a 102 century break in the process. Ebdon, who complained about the table being \"very heavy\" and playing \"like a club table\", went on to win 10–8, with two breaks of 79 and others of 84 and 72 along the way. Other players also made complaints about the tables, and organizers agreed to re- them later on.\nBarry Hawkins was the only player to make his debut at the main stage of the World Championship in this edition, meaning it was the first time that just one player was new at the Crucible. In his first-round match against Ken Doherty, the 1997 champion, he took the first frame with a 66 break, but then lost ten in a row, with Doherty compiling four half-centuries. \"Ken had nobody to beat and I'm gutted after such a good season to have played like that\", regretted Hawkins, who had, nonetheless, secured a place amongst the top 10 for the following season. In a repeat of one of the 2000 semi-finals, two-time runner-up Matthew Stevens compiled two century breaks in the first session against Joe Swail, who was \"absolutely disgusted\" with the table and fell 3–6 behind in the scoreboard. In the last session, Stevens made another century, this time of 112, and clinched victory with a result of 10–5. 1992 and 1993 semi-finalist Alan McManus faced Marco Fu, quarter-finalist in 2003. Fu went into the final session with a 4–3 lead and won six out of the six frames that were played to seal victory, leaving McManus out of the top 16 for the following season. Stephen Maguire, who had not made it past the first round up to that point, defeated Mark King 10–6, producing breaks of 78 and 77 in the final session.\nTwo-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan made a century break of 106 in the first frame, in which he was helped by an \"outrageous \", according to his rival Dave Harold, and took a 7–0 lead with further breaks of 67, 139 and 70. Harold responded with an 80 break and won another one to edge closer and end the first session 2–7. O'Sullivan won the match in the final session with a century of 100 and then half-centuries of 54 and 88 in the last two frames, for a 10–4 result. Mark Williams, the 2000 and 2003 champion, won the first four frames of his match against Anthony Hamilton, who then replied with a 115, but who would end up losing 1–10. \"John Higgins has gone out, and now I hope Ronnie O'Sullivan, Stephen Hendry and Matthew Stevens go out and Willie Thorne (now retired) comes in!\", said Williams afterwards. Stephen Lee, winner of the 2006 Welsh Open during the season, took a 6–3 lead against Ali Carter into the final session, but then fell one frame behind at 7–8 after Carter won five frames in a row, the last of them with a century of 135. Lee then produced breaks of 61 and 62 to move to one away from victory and also took the final one after Carter failed to a long-distance to win 10–8. 2004 quarter-finalist Joe Perry won the first frame against Ryan Day with a break of 97, but then lost seven on the trot. Going into the final session with a 7–2 lead, Day compiled breaks of 55 and 58 for a 10–3 victory. \"I don't know if you can practice too hard but I left all my form on the practice table\", said Perry.\nSecond round.\nThe second round of the event was played as the best of 25 frames, held over three sessions, between 20 and 24 April. Robertson opened a three-frame gap against Lee with a 109 century and, although Lee replied with two centuries of his own, the Australian was 10–6 ahead going into the final session. Robertson won 13–9 after the last six frames of the match were shared, with each player making another century. Murphy began his match against Davis with a century of 106 and had an 8–3 lead when the Crucible had to be evacuated due to a fire alarm. On the other table, Selby was playing Williams and was on a break of 26 when they were required to leave. Murphy edged out Davis with a 13–7 result. Williams went into the final session with an 11–5 lead, then compiled an 85 break to put himself one away from victory and clinched a 13–8 win. Maguire, playing in the second round for the first time, lost six of the eight frames of the second session against Fu, who compiled centuries of 125, 118 and 101 for a 13–4 victory. Fu thanked Terry Griffiths, the 1979 champion and 1988 runner-up, for his coaching: \"He's been helping me with a few things: , the way I the , the approach to the shot, angles and it all seems to be working quite well\".\nIn a repeat of the 2000 Masters final, Doherty and Stevens were tied at eight frames each, but Doherty won five on the trot, featuring breaks of 83, 63, 69 and 67 and a three-ball in the last one, to advance into the quarter-finals. Dott had a four-frame lead going into the final session against Bond, whom he regarded as having a \"similar style based on tactics rather than potting\", and managed to preserve it and won 13–9. 2004 quarter-finalist Gray took on Ebdon, who opened the match with a century of 107. Ebdon won the last nine frames of the match to seal a 13–2 victory. O'Sullivan, runner-up of the 2006 Masters during the season, faced Day, who had never made it to this stage of the World Championship before. O'Sullivan compiled in the sixth frame the highest break of the tournament with a 140, but Day, who on various occasions during the match, took a 9–7 lead into the final session. O'Sullivan turned the match around with breaks of up to 68 and 75, and won over Day 13–10.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals of the event were played as the best of 25 frames, held over three sessions, between 25 and 26 April. Ebdon took a 7–0 lead against Murphy with breaks of 116, 64, 52 and 96, although Murphy managed to put one on the board before the end of the first session. The next morning, aided by breaks of 77, twice of 83 and of 113, Murphy managed to pull back to 10–6. Each player went on to make a century as, for the second year in a row, Ebdon ousted the defending champion in the quarter-finals, having won over O'Sullivan in the previous edition. This also made Murphy the 13th first-time champion who failed to defend his title since the tournament moved to the Crucible in 1977, succumbing to what has become known as the 'Crucible curse'. Fu, who compiled two centuries, and Doherty were tied at 8–8 at the beginning of the last session. The first four frames of the final session were shared, with Fu making a further century of 135, but the Hongkongese player won the last three on the spin, including breaks of 60 and 75, to clinch victory. \"I blew it. I can't grumble because I had my chances\", said Doherty afterwards. In winning, Fu became the first player from Asia since Wattana in 1997 to reach the semi-finals.\nDott was 10–6 and also 12–8 ahead of Robertson, with only one more frame required to reach the semi-final. However, first time quarter-finalist Robertson then won the next four frames, including a 103 century, to level the match at 12–12 and take it to a deciding frame, which Dott won, after Robertson was left needing a with only the and remaining on the table and ended up accidentally potting the pink instead of laying a snooker. Robertson said afterwards that he thought he was \"one of the best players in the world\" at the moment: \"Obviously I have to start winning tournaments to prove that, but I don't think anyone can out-play me long-potting wise\". Going into the evening session, O'Sullivan had a four-frame lead at 10–6 against Williams, who then took five of the next six frames, until O'Sullivan stopped the rot with a 90 break and put himself only one away from victory, which he clinched in the following one. Williams foresaw that O'Sullivan would go on to win the tournament, pointing out he looked \"so confident\".\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played as the best of 33 frames, held over four sessions, between 27 and 29 April. Fu, playing in his first ever World Championship semi-final, faced Ebdon. The first session, which at the end was shared between the players at four frames each, took over four hours of playing time. Members of the audience even complained and shouted it was \"like watching paint dry\". Clive Everton, writing for \"The Guardian\", predicted \"TV viewing figures would soon slump dramatically\" if the same \"funereal pace\" were to affect every game, with one frame lasting 52 minutes and another one 46. Century breaks of 107, 101 and 122 put Ebdon 15–9 ahead, only two frames away from a place in the final. Fu, however, produced two centuries and further breaks of 68, 52 and 75 as he took six frames on the trot to level the match at 15–15. The match went into a decider, which Ebdon won for a 17–16 result, playing the final balls with tears in his eyes. \"In all honesty, Marco deserved to win it was such a gutsy comeback from him\", he said afterwards.\nDott kicked off his semi-final against O'Sullivan with a 121 century break, but fell 3–5 behind at the conclusion of the first session. During the second session, with the scores tied at seven frames each, there was an incident with O'Sullivan's , which he seemed to take off himself. Despite this, he was awarded a 15-minute break for emergency repairs, after which he compiled a 124 break. Dott won all eight frames of the third session, including half-centuries of 92, 86 and 53, and went from 8–8 to 16–8. O'Sullivan narrowed the deficit winning three frames on the trot and making two 60 breaks along the way, but in the 28th frame, he left the final black hanging close to the and Dott potted it to clinch the frame by one point and the match 17–11 to advance into the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was played as a best-of-35-frames, held over four sessions on 30 April and 1 and 2 May, between Ebdon and Dott. Ebdon, competing in his third World Championship final, having lost one and won the other one, became the first player to reach the final without meeting a top 16 player, given that Murphy, albeit the top seed as the reigning champion, was not within the top 16. Meanwhile, it was Dott's second appearance in the final, after being runner-up to O'Sullivan in 2004. Jan Verhaas, who had officiated the 2003 final between Williams and Doherty, took charge of his second world final. Ebdon took the first frame despite suffering a , and Dott's 62 break in the second was enough to beat the 53 made by Ebdon. With intense tactical play from both players, the first session saw only six frames played, with a 4–2 lead for Dott. After the break, Dott increased his lead with four consecutive frames, but Ebdon stopped the rot by taking the fifth of the second session and also compiled a 89 break in the following one to narrow the deficit to four at 4–8. The first day's play continued until 12:45 am, and Dott, whose highest break of the first two sessions was of 62, had an 11–5 lead at the end of it.\nA break of 56 at the beginning of the third session put Dott seven frames clear of his rival. Ebdon replied with a break of 78, but Dott took the following one for a 13–6 lead. In the twentieth frame, Dott compiled a break of 62, but Ebdon then managed to snooker him. Although Dott could not at first, he fluked the snooker back and took the frame. In the following frame, Ebdon missed a black ball that allowed Dott to make a 65-point clearance. Dott also took the last frame of the third session for a 15–7 lead, three away from the title. The third session on the second day also finished after only six frames.\nThe fourth and final session of the final began with a century of 117—the first and only one of the final—for Ebdon, who started it with a plant to pot the first red. In the 24th frame, Dott missed the black off its when he was on a 51 break trying to counteract Ebdon's 34, and allowed him to get back to the table. When clearing up the colours, Ebdon was attempting to pot the green ball and got a kick. The green, however, potted after hitting the of the pocket. Ebdon reacted by doing a little pirouette movement and said jokingly to the Crucible crowd \"Now you know why I get them wiped so often!\" The 27th frame was the longest in Crucible history and the longest televised frame on record, lasting 74 minutes. It was won by Ebdon 66–59, reducing his deficit to 12–15. The following frame was won by Ebdon with a break of 84 in 11 minutes, the quickest of the final, which allowed him to move to only two frames away from Dott. Dott then took his first frame of the final session with a break of 66, but Ebdon replied and reduced the deficit to two once again at 14–16. The 31st frame featured breaks of 51 by Ebdon and 68 by Dott, who took it with a clearance to move to one away from victory and celebrated loudly. The score became 17–14 at 12:22 am, thus surpassing by fifty minutes the 1985 final between Davis and Dennis Taylor as the latest finish for a final at the Crucible.\nBoth players had chances to take the 32nd frame, but Dott, who went over to kiss the trophy before potting his last ball, clinched victory. It was the first time he won a ranking event, having already been a runner-up on four occasions. Dott said afterwards that he \"kept twitching\" when Ebdon was coming back at him. \"I knew I was playing too slowly and too negatively, so I decided to change something. I washed my face. I sped up my play. I was doing anything to give myself a chance\", he added.\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for each round.

        "text": "Derek Ervin Smith (November 1, 1961 – August 9, 1996) was an American professional basketball player. He won a national championship with the Louisville Cardinals in 1980, and spent nine years in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in a career shortened by a knee injury. He would later become an assistant coach for the Washington Bullets from 1994 until his death.\nCareer.\nSmith attended the University of Louisville from 1979 to 1982. He was a member of the 1980 University of Louisville Cardinals basketball team which won the NCAA championship, defeating UCLA 59–54.\nSmith is sometimes credited with popularizing the term \"high five\" during the 1979–80 basketball season.\nSmith was selected 35th overall, 13th in the second round, by the Golden State Warriors in the 1982 NBA draft. After his rookie season, he was waived by the Warriors and became a free agent. At the request of Portland Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman, Smith received a try out with the . After impressing Clippers head coach Jim Lynam, Smith was offered a contract for the 1983–84 season. He would play for the San Diego / Los Angeles Clippers from 1983 to 1986. He averaged 22 points per game in 1984–85. In the next season, he averaged 23.5 points per game, but he was limited to 11 games because of a knee injury followed by mononucleosis. He played for the Sacramento Kings from 1986 to 1989, for the Philadelphia 76ers in 1989 and 1990, and for the Boston Celtics in 1991. Despite only playing in 2 regular season games for the Celtics, he is still remembered by Boston fans for his heroic game 5 performance against the Pacers in the first round of the 1991 playoffs. In this decisive game, Smith came off the bench to score 12 key points and provide rugged defense against Chuck Person. During his NBA career, he scored over 5,000 points.\nSmith became an assistant coach for the Washington Bullets in 1994.\nSmith was widely renowned as a \"great guess\" on hoopgrids.com on September 7, 2023.\nDeath.\nIn August 1996, Smith went on a cruise on the Norwegian Cruise Line ship MS \"Dreamward\" for season ticketholders of the Bullets and the Washington Capitals. He took his family along. Smith and then-Bullets player Tim Legler volunteered to hold basketball clinics during the cruise.\nOn August 9, 1996, while the ship was near Bermuda and returning to New York City, Smith suddenly suffered an apparent massive heart attack during a farewell cocktail party in the presence of members of his team. Ship medics attempted to resuscitate him for 25 minutes before declaring him dead.\nSmith was buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. His funeral was attended by the Bullets team and several former teammates.\nFamily.\nDerek was married to Monica, with whom he had two children: a daughter, Sydney, and a son, Nolan. Nolan played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils and was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers. In 2010, like his father 30 years before him, Nolan made it to the NCAA D-I tournament; Nolan and his Duke Blue Devils won the National Championship, just as Derek and his Louisville Cardinals had done in 1980. Nolan has a tattoo of his father on his right arm.\nIn April 2022, Nolan joined the coaching staff at his father's alma mater."

        "title": "List of NCAA Philippines basketball champions",
        "text": "The National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) (NCAA) holds its annual basketball tournaments for the Seniors' and Juniors' divisions from June to October of the academic year. The tournament started in 1924, the NCAA's inaugural year, and has been held continuously since then, only interrupted by World War II from 1942 to 1946, suspension of play from 1961 to 1965 due to the proliferation of ineligible players, and the 1980 riot between supporters of La Salle and Letran which wrecked the Rizal Memorial Coliseum which forced the association to suspend the rest of the season.\nFor much of the NCAA's history, the team at the top of the standings during the first half of the season faced the team that won the latter half of the season for the championship; in 1960 if a third team had a better cumulative record than either champion, that team played the champion of the latter half of the season to face the champion of the first half for the NCAA championship.\nIn 1998, the \"Final Four\" format used in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) was first applied: in a modified Shaughnessy playoff system, the two teams with the best records possess the \"twice to beat advantage\" in which they only have to win once to advance to the best-of-three finals while their opponents have to win twice. Prior to the introduction of the \"Final Four\" format, if a team managed to win all of the group stage games (or at least won both halves of the season), the team were named outright champions. At the introduction of the \"Final Four\" format the unbeaten team had an outright finals berth with the twice to beat advantage while the remaining three teams played in a single-elimination tournament; in 2008, the unbeaten team still qualified outright for the finals but the finals was a best-of-three series. Starting in 2010, the unbeaten team possesses the \"thrice to beat\" advantage where they only have to win twice while their opponent has to win thrice to win the championship. In 2017, the NCAA reverted to a rule where an unbeaten team still had a bye to the finals but the finals was a best-of-three series and the number 2 team in the stepladder series will not have twice to beat advantage.\nList of champions per year.\nEarly years (1924–1935).\nThe NCAA was founded by the Ateneo de Manila, De La Salle College, the Institute of Accounts (known today as Far Eastern University), National University, San Beda College, the University of Manila, the University of the Philippines Manila and the University of Santo Tomas. Membership was fluid, and the composition of the association changed frequently. To this date, San Beda is the only founding member left in the association.\nThe old-timer six (1936–68).\nAfter National University, University of the Philippines Manila, and University of Santo Tomas left the NCAA in 1932, the Ateneo de Manila, Colegio de San Juan de Letran, De La Salle College, José Rizal College, Mapúa Institute of Technology and San Beda College continued the association and its membership remained unchanged for several decades.\nWorld War II interrupted the NCAA's activities in 1941, but the association resumed operations after the war in 1947.\nFirst expansion (1969–78).\nSan Sebastian College–Recoletos was admitted in 1969, marking the first change in the NCAA's membership since 1936. This increased the association's membership to seven colleges. Trinity College of Quezon City was also admitted in 1974, the association's golden anniversary, according to publications of the day.\nFirst contraction (1978–84).\nThe Ateneo de Manila University left the association in 1978 after the championship series against San Beda College where the final game was held behind closed doors. In September 1980, De La Salle University withdrew from the association after an August 17 game against Colegio de San Juan Letran turned into a full-blown riot which led to the game being called off. The association ordered the game to be replayed behind closed doors but the then-FIBA recognized basketball association, the Basketball Association of the Philippines, ordered the association to cancel the rest of the season.\nSan Beda College left in 1984 to concentrate on intramural events.\nSecond expansion (1984–95).\nAfter the Ateneo de Manila, La Salle, and San Beda left, the NCAA opened its doors to new members. In 1984, Perpetual Help College of Rizal was accepted as a new member, while Trinity College of Quezon City became a full member in 1985, after the Stallions were admitted earlier provisionally, in 1974). San Beda rejoined the association in 1986, while Trinity left in the same year.\nThird expansion (1996–2009).\nIn 1996, Philippine Christian University became the seventh member of the NCAA. Two years later, De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde was admitted as the eighth member.\nThe Final Four format as used in the UAAP was first applied in 1998.\nFourth expansion (2009–present).\nIn 2009, Angeles University Foundation (AUF), Arellano University, Emilio Aguinaldo College (EAC) participated as guest members for the 2009–10 season; only Arellano and EAC were accepted as members on probation starting on the 2010–11 season. In 2011, Lyceum of the Philippines University was invited as a guest team that would play on the 2011–12 season. Arellano was elevated to regular membership after all the association requirements were met. EAC and Lyceum remained on probation; their status and performances were evaluated at the end of the 2014–15 season. Weeks before the start of NCAA Season 91, EAC and Lyceum were elevated to regular membership.\nStatistics.\nNotes:"

        "text": "The 2006 international cricket season started with controversial ICC members Zimbabwe touring the West Indies for a series of seven One Day International matches. Because Zimbabwe recently pulled out of playing Test matches, the tour had to be rescheduled which meant the two Test matches were turned into limited overs games, bumping them up from the original five. After Zimbabwe's decision to leave Test cricket at the start of 2006, the West Indies Cricket Board had reconsidered the tour, but without any other team to play they had to appease both sponsors and fans. Although the teams lie next to each other in the ICC ODI Championship, West Indies holds 89 points in eighth place, 47 more than the tourists' 42 in ninth.\nOne-Day Matches.\nFirst ODI (29 April).\nBrian Lara's first match in his third spell as captain ended in victory, as Zimbabwe mustered 151 in their 50 overs, and four West Indian bowlers got two wickets each. Despite Runako Morton recording a duck, West Indies made it to the target with five wickets and 11.4 overs to spare, as Lara top scored with 40, the second highest total of the match. However, according to Cricinfo reporter Will Luke, West Indies \"rarely looked in complete control\". For Zimbabwe, Blessing Mahwire bowled seven overs and conceded 14 runs with six wides, while Prosper Utseya picked up a career best three for 35. In the first innings, Justice Chibhabha hit a half-century in his second ODI.\nSecond ODI (30 April).\nDespite another half-century from Justice Chibhabha, this time worth 12 runs more than in the first ODI, Zimbabwe's total of 144 was seven lower than in the first ODI. West Indies had batted first, making 242 for 9 after Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul all passed 40, while five Zimbabwean bowlers got at least one wicket each. Jerome Taylor then took four wickets as Zimbabwe fell for 144, with Elton Chigumbura (13) and Tawanda Mupariwa (16) joining Chibhabha with double figure scores.\nTour Match: Zimbabwe v University of West Indies Vice Chancellor's XI (3 May).\nUniversity of West Indies Vice Chancellor's XI won by 5 wickets\nPiet Rinke hit 113 for the Zimbabweans in the 13-a-side match, and Brendan Taylor and Charles Coventry also took half-centuries. For the University of West Indies' XI, Ryan Hinds and Xavier Marshall, who had both played internationals for West Indies before, made scores of 117 not out and 54 respectively, and C. Walton anchored the chase with 67 as the hosts won with 23 balls to spare.\nFourth ODI (7 May).\nWest Indies sealed at least a draw in the series after a convincing 82-run victory over Zimbabwe in Georgetown. The West Indies handed a debut to 25-year-old opener Sewnarine Chattergoon but he disappointed in front of his home crowd scoring only 9. But a few players did play a part in the massive total of 333/6 set by the West Indies. Shivnarine Chanderpaul top scored with 93 off 82 balls (7 fours &amp; 4 sixes), and there were also half-centuries from Runako Morton (79 off 90) and captain Brian Lara (56 off 45). This set Zimbabwe an unlikely 334 target, and sure enough struggled. Fidel Edwards bowled Piet Rinke with the first ball of the innings, and also took the scalp of Zimbabwean captain Terry Duffin with the 4th ball of that over, leaving Zimbabwe at one run for two wickets, but steady knocks from Justice Chibhabha, Vusi Sibanda and Elton Chigumbura got the Zimbabweans past 100. But they weren't scoring quickly enough, and after their allotted 50 overs, came up 82 runs short, with Edwards the pick of the bowlers. This was also the last international match at the Bourda ground:"

It is located close to Pir Meher Ali Shah University and Rawalpindi Arts Council. The first international match at the stadium was played on 19 January 1992, when Sri Lanka faced Pakistan in an ODI. The stadium hosted its first Test match in 1993, when Zimbabwe toured Pakistan. \nTest cricket returned to Pakistan at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium during the 2019 two-match Test series against Sri Lanka. The first test match was held from 11–15 December 2019 in Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.\nHistory.\nRawalpindi Cricket Stadium was established in 1992 and replaced Pindi Club Ground as an international stadium. It is the home ground of Islamabad United and Northern cricket team. Before the construction of Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Rawalpindi Club Cricket Ground had been used as a venue for international matches, including one Test match against New Zealand that was held in March 1965.\nRawalpindi Cricket Stadium was a prime spot in the 1995–96 Cricket World Cup. With an eye on the that World Cup, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) unveiled a new Test venue for the second Test against Zimbabwe in Rawalpindi, becoming the country's 14th Test ground. The floodlights were added in late 2001 when the Australians were set to tour the region. The stadium is just 20 minutes from the capital Islamabad and is the only international cricket stadium in the Islamabad Capital territory.\nThis stadium is the home ground and international debut ground of world's fastest bowler Shoaib Akhtar who is called with the nickname of Rawalpindi Express.\nIn the 2nd ODI of 2004 Samsung ODI series, while other Indian batters are getting struggling with the pace and spin attack of Pakistan, Sachin Tendulkar played a courageous knock of 141 (135) in this ground.\nRevival of cricket in Pakistan.\nIn April 2018, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced that the venue, along with several others in the country, would get a makeover to get them ready for future international matches and fixtures in the Pakistan Super League.\nPakistan vs Sri Lanka Test match.\nIn October 2019, the PCB proposed hosting the two Test matches in Pakistan, instead of the UAE, at venues in Rawalpindi and Karachi. Sri Lanka Cricket said that they were \"very positive\" with regards to the progress of playing Test cricket in Pakistan. In November 2019, the PCB confirmed the dates and venues for the Test series, with the first test match taking place in Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium from 11 to 15 December. It was the first test match played at this venue after 15 years and first International match after 13 years.\nCricket World Cup.\nThis Stadium hosted three ODI matches during the 1996 Cricket World Cup.\nList of five wicket hauls.\nTests.\nTwelve five-wicket hauls have been taken in Test matches at the ground. \nOne Day Internationals.\nFive five-wicket hauls have been taken in One Day Internationals at the ground.

        "title": "Indian cricket team in the West Indies in 2006",
        "text": "India toured the West Indies during the 2006 international cricket season. India were ranked highly above the West Indies in both the ICC Test Championship as well as the ICC ODI Championship but the latter team had the favour of beating Zimbabwe 5–0 in a series of One Day International matches earlier in the month. West Indies eventually emerged as winners of this ODI series, taking it 4–1 after losing the first match in the final over.\nIndia had not won a Test series in the West Indies for 35 years, but India defeated the West Indies 1–0 in the Test series. Rahul Dravid, the Indian squad captain, was awarded the Man of the Series award for his performance.\nFormer West Indian fast bowler and commentator, Michael Holding, said between the ODIs and Tests that the West Indies ODI series win was an event that \"nobody had foreseen\".\nSquads.\nPlayers were selected for both ODIs and Tests unless otherwise specified.\nOne-Day Matches.\nTour Match (16 May).\nIndians 7/289 (50) def Jamaica 173 (45) by 116 runs. \nFirst ODI.\nIndia won the toss and captain Rahul Dravid elected to field first, after five overs were cut off each side's innings due to heavy overnight rain. West Indies hit 251 runs for 6 wickets, with Chris Gayle contributing nearly half the total, 123, before he was out with five overs remaining to Ajit Agarkar, who got the most wickets for India, claiming two for 38. However, India also had an opener contributing a century, with Rahul Dravid bringing up his hundred in 99 balls, eventually ending with 105 off 102. Dravid paired up with Mohammad Kaif to add 123 for the fourth wicket, before Dwayne Bravo had Dravid caught, leaving India with 43 to get from the last 37 balls; with two fours and a six from Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and Kaif hitting 16 off his last 16 deliveries, India made it to the target with a ball to spare.\nSecond ODI.\nIndia won the toss and captain Rahul Dravid elected to field first, looking for his 18th continuous win batting second, but it was not to be his day as Dwayne Bravo delivered a \"clever slower ball\" which went through Yuvraj Singh's wicket, leaving him bowled and India all out for 197 needing 199 to win.\nWest Indies lost both openers with one run, sending Brian Lara in to bat with Ramnaresh Sarwan. Captain Lara was caught off Pathan for 14, however, which was to be the fourth-highest total of West Indies' innings. The second-highest was 21, from Carlton Baugh, but due to an unbeaten 98 from Ramnaresh Sarwan, which later resulted in Man of the Match honours, the West Indies' total read 198 for nine, with Sarwan and Jerome Taylor adding 34 off 20 balls for the ninth wicket before Fidel Edwards scored the final run of the innings.\nIn reply, India started better than West Indies, making 37 for the first two wickets, which were catches off Ian Bradshaw's bowling. Two more wickets followed, with Fidel Edwards and Jerome Taylor picking up one each, but at 60 for four in the 17th over, India were still 17 ahead of West Indies' score for the same number of wickets. Then, like in the West Indian innings, the fifth-wicket stand was the highest of the game. However, the 64 runs came at a rate of 3.49 an over, somewhat short of the required four to win, and after Suresh Raina's dismissal Dhoni and Agarkar followed within the next three overs.\nIndia now had three wickets in hand and 64 to get, but Ramesh Powar batted for eight overs together with Yuvraj Singh, as the pair cut 43 off the total, Powar contributing 12. Powar was caught off Marlon Samuels' bowling, however, as the spinner picked up his second wicket, and Chris Gayle then held a return catch off Harbhajan Singh two overs later. That left India with 12 runs to get off 10 balls; the remainder of Gayle's over went for one run, and India needed eleven off the last over, which was to be bowled by Dwayne Bravo (who had only bowled three of the 49 previous overs). Munaf Patel faced the first ball, got it away for a single, before Yuvraj Singh hit two fours to leave himself with two runs to get off three balls, only to be clean bowled off the last delivery."

        "title": "Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 2006",
        "text": "Sri Lanka toured England for cricket matches during the 2006 international cricket season. England were back home for the first time since September and looked to maintain their Test standards, which saw them keep their second place in the ICC Test Championship in India, and the teams were also competing for sixth place in the ICC ODI Championship as both England and Sri Lanka were coming off the back of two lost ODI tours on the Asian sub-continent, against India and Pakistan respectively. To add to problems, both teams were likely to be missing some key members of the team as England were without some of their squad for their previous tour and, two days before Sri Lanka departed for England, it was revealed that skipper Marvan Atapattu would stay at home for the tour due to back problems that had forced him to skip his previous tour too. Jehan Mubarak was brought in as his replacement.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nDay One.\nEngland won the toss and decided to bat. Flintoff handed Sajid Mahmood his first Test cap, while Chamara Kapugedera made his Test debut for Sri Lanka. Marcus Trescothick opened for England for the first time since last year, alongside Andrew Strauss. 20 minutes before lunch Muttiah Muralitharan was brought in for his first over at Lord's, the 23rd of the England innings, with the seamers not having taken a wicket. However, in the fourth over of Muralitharan's innings Jayawardene had Strauss caught off Muralitharan, putting the English at 86 for one at lunch. The afternoon session started with Alastair Cook, playing in his first home Test, coming in to face his first ball in home Test cricket; after leaving that one alone, he proceeded to 44 not out by tea, while Trescothick was on 95 not out. Trescothick got his hundred by \"slogging\" Muralitharan for a single, but in the next over he, too, perished through being caught by Jayawardene. England batted through to stumps and lost only one further wicket, with Cook caught behind off Farveez Maharoof's bowling for 89, and England closed with nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard at the crease and the overnight total 318 for three. Sri Lanka, however, had taken a catch off a no-ball, a close lbw against Kevin Pietersen turned down off Chaminda Vaas, and Alastair Cook a couple of inches from being run out.\nDay Two.\nThe day began with Hoggard staying in the crease opposite Pietersen for 37 balls before being bowled by Vaas. This gave way to Paul Collingwood, who had made his first Test century in the first Test of the 2005–06 India tour. Collingwood contributed 57 to a partnership of 173 between the two before Pietersen fell at 158 trapped lbw by Vaas, and Collingwood a few balls later fell in the same fashion by Muralitharan. With England six down, Andrew Flintoff and Geraint Jones were the new batsmen, and the two made scores 33 and 11 respectively before Flintoff declared following his second six, off Muralitharan. The umpires called tea time early due to the declaration and the touring team came back out with their openers Mubarak and Tharanga. However, Mubarak quickly went back, after he was bowled by Hoggard without a run scored by any of the batsmen. Tharanga went five overs later, though with a more successful partnership of 21, the same number of runs the third Sri Lankan, Kumar Sangakkara, managed to make before caught off Sajid Mahmood, his first Test dismissal. At this time, they were 81 for two: fifteen minutes later, the scoreboard read 85 for six, with three batsmen out for ducks including debutante Kapugedera who fell on his first Test ball. The day's play was curtailed by bad light, which left Sri Lanka at 91 for six, fourteen of which came off English extras, while Mahmood's debut figures read three for nine.\nDay Three.\nIt started with the clement weather of the last few days overshadowed by clouds and the forecast of rain. With Mahmood unable to add to his tally from yesterday, conceding 41 runs on the day. Sri Lanka batted through ten overs, but Farveez Maharoof gave a return catch to Hoggard, and two overs later Flintoff makes a breakthrough, getting Jayawardene out with a catch by wicket-keeper Geraint Jones. However, the ninth-wicket stand between Vaas and Nuwan Kulasekara gave the most runs of the entire innings, as the two add 62 in just over an hour. After lunch, however, they were out in the space of three deliveries, and Sri Lanka were all out for 192.\nFlintoff enforced the follow on, and once again Mubarak was out in single figures to Hoggard, the total 10 for one. However, Tharanga and Sangakkara built Sri Lanka's largest partnership of the match thus far, both making half-centuries and sharing a stand of 109. Eventually both batsmen were caught by Jones off spinner Monty Panesar, with Sangakkara's innings lasting four and a half hours for 65 runs, but at this point England required seven wickets and had two days to do it in.\nDay Four.\nNightwatchman Farveez Maharoof frustrated the England bowlers. He was dropped on 30 by Paul Collingwood, and went on to bat through 40 overs and 166 minutes, as Sri Lanka went through the entire morning session without loss. England then got two wickets in five overs, both courtesy of Sajid Mahmood, but that only brought in Tillakaratne Dilshan. Another 20 overs followed without a wicket, with Mahela Jayawardene completing his century, before being caught behind for 119 four overs before the close of play on day four, as 24 overs were cut due to bad light.\nDay Five.\nSri Lanka then lost both their last specialist batsmen, Kapugedera and Dilshan, but were leading by 62 runs at that time. The ninth-wicket partners Vaas and Kulasekara, however, had already showed their batting skills by having the highest partnership of the first innings, and they were eight runs away from achieving that again in the second. Batting through 189 minutes, the pair secured the draw for Sri Lanka, with Kulasekara even hitting a couple of sixes as he ended with 64 when Pietersen held a catch off Hoggard's bowling. However, by then it was too late, as Sri Lanka led by 167 runs and there was only half an hour left to score those runs in. Indeed, the tenth-wicket stand frustrated England until stumps: Muralitharan faced out that half-hour, scoring one run, while Vaas got his half-century before the close of play.\n2nd Test.\nDay One.\nSri Lanka won the toss and skipper Mahela Jayawardene chose to bat; it seemed that they made the wrong choice as England crippled them to 82/8 with the help of a swinging wicket, before Chaminda Vaas and Lasith Malinga put up a half century partnership and the team were all out for 141. Matthew Hoggard's swinging and cult-hero Monty Panesar put on impressive shows but regular ODI player, Liam Plunkett, was the real boon of the side. Before the end of the first day, England had all but closed the deficit as stumps was called at 138/3, Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss putting on a 56 partnership before Alastair Cook came out, soon followed by big-hitter Kevin Pietersen who was 30 at stumps aided by a 6, and went on to score another Test century the next day - the only batsmen in the first innings to hit more than 30. Despite the hot-headed player's skills, England were not fully confident at the slip, Cook being saved by a dropped ball by the Sri Lanka skipper and Muttiah Muralitharan proved quite a threat.\nDay Two.\nPietersen opened the second day, 80 minutes late thanks to rain, with nightwatchmen Hoggard, the latter putting on his normal single figures, this time 3 runs, but holding the line for 36 balls. Once normal play resumed with Paul Collingwood England continued to dominate, setting their targets high with a 69 partnership before Collingwood gloved Murali to short leg for 238/5 and was replaced by skipper Andrew Flintoff who was surprisingly tame. Pietersen went on to hit three 4s in as many balls before hitting a reverse-sweeper 6 but then being bowled lbw by Murali, achieving three Test centuries in consecutive Tests. After the departure of their number four, England crumbled hopelessly from 290/6 to 295 all out just before tea. The mood in the English camp was swiftly revitalised by the hot drinks as Hoggard bowled Upul Tharanga for a golden duck, having been bowled for nothing in the first innings. Two more men went to see the tourists at 43/3 with a 111 run deficit and before the close of play Geraint Jones redeemed his missed catch to Thilan Samaraweera by stumping soon after, unbeaten opener Michael Vandort remained at the crease for 30 when play closed at 7:30 due to the missed play earlier.\nDay Three.\nAfter persistent rain over Birmingham, play was started at 4:45 and the fifth wicket held up for 125, helping them take the lead. Both batsmen fought off good efforts by Panesar and Plunkett but eventually it was Hoggard who made the only breakthrough on a day where Sri Lanka stood tall for a short day at 194/5.\nDay Four.\nWith the new ball due six overs into the fourth day Sri Lankan wickets fell thick and fast, half the team falling before lunch, the last of which being opener Michael Vandort who narrowly missed out on being the fifth batsmen ever to hold his wicket throughout an entire innings. England took to the crease just before lunch with a very slow run rate that came only from Strauss - Trescothick fell after nine runs, none of them contributed by him. The third man, Alastair Cook held out for the rest of the innings though achieving 34 not out; during this time Strauss fell to a controversial catch, replays showed it popped off his pads. Pietersen, wanting to end the Test quickly, took the wicket with his usual speed, taking 13 runs off 25 balls his confidence assured by a catch by the tourists' skipper to be called a no ball, and a further two no balls which he took boundaries off. However, his cockiness proved his downfall as he lashed out at a ball from Murali, the only bowler to take wickets in the second innings, and was caught plumb. Collingwood soon fell for 3 and it seemed as if the easy target of 78 was going to be more of a struggle but Cook, remaining from the second partnership, took two runs and two byes and skipper Flintoff, who done nothing with his first three balls, drove Murali down the ground to long on for four on his fourth ball to win the match, and his third in a row as English skipper.\n3rd Test.\nDay One.\nSri Lanka came into the third Test looking to level the series, and Mahela Jayawardene won the toss and again chose to bat. Nuwan Kulasekara and Thilan Samaraweera were dropped from the side, and Sanath Jayasuriya and Chamara Kapugedera came in. This was a return to test cricket for Jayasuriya following a previously announced retirement.\nAs at Edgbaston, Sri Lanka struggled batting first and Andrew Flintoff and Jon Lewis (who was in the side on debut replacing Sajid Mahmood) took 5 wickets between them to leave Sri Lanka on 139/8. However, England were unable to finish things off and Chaminda Vaas, who had shown resistance batting throughout the series, added 92 runs with the last two wickets. Muttiah Muralitharan hit 3 fours and 1 six in a very useful cameo, which included some remarkable shots. This late flurry of runs would prove critical in the match.\nEngland's openers began the reply tentatively, and by the end of the first day, England were 53/2 in reply to Sri Lanka's 231.\nDay Two.\nSri Lanka came out on the second day with a very positive approach, which was noticeable from the start of the day's play. Their body language was positive, and Mahela Jayawardene displayed good strategic application with the field placings he set, and frustrated England's batsmen in the process. A key point was the dismissal of Kevin Pietersen for 41, given that he had scored big centuries in the first innings of the previous two tests. Andrew Flintoff was dismissed cheaply and Sri Lanka had gained momentum in reducing England to 118/5.\nThe remaining batsmen struggled, with Paul Collingwood taking nearly 4 hours to score the innings highest score of 48. Jon Lewis hit a quickfire 20 to boost the score to almost parity with Sri Lanka as England were bowled out for 229. Although Sri Lanka lost Michael Vandort in the first over of their second innings, they reached 45/1 by the close of play on the second day.\nDay Three.\nSri Lanka showed application in their approach to batting, knowing that they did not need to score at a quick rate given the amount of time remaining in the match. Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Kapugedera both scored 50s, and Jayawardene and Upul Tharanga scored 45 and 46 respectively. By the end of the day, their score had progressed to 286/7, a lead of 288.\nDay Four.\nEngland took the final three Sri Lankan wickets, but not without their score progressing to 322 – thanks to the efforts of Lasith Malinga, who scored 22, and Chaminda Vaas who was unbeaten on 34. England had only managed to dismiss him twice in the entire series.\nFor England, Monty Panesar took his first five wicket haul, recording figures of 5/78. This left England needing 325 to win, a record for Trent Bridge.\nEngland started their chase confidently, albeit with some slices of luck. Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss progressed the score to 84 before the first wicket fell, to Muttiah Muralitharan. From that point on, Muralitharan assumed total control of the match, and of England's batsman.\nHe proceeded to take the next 6 wickets, reducing England to 132/7, and at that point, would have harboured hopes of capturing all 10 wickets. However, the next wicket to fall was to a run out. But this did not deter him, and he took a further wicket – that of Jon Lewis to leave the score at 153/9. England were on the verge of defeat, still needing 172 to win with one wicket remaining.\nAll was left to do was for Monty Panesar to dispel the popular belief that he was incapable of batting – he proceeded to attack Muralitharan's bowling – hitting 3 fours and one remarkable swept six on the way to a career best 26. In the end, Muralitharan did not claim his wicket – with Jayasuriya being the one to dismiss him lbw.\nEngland had been bowled out for 190 – pretty much by one man. Muralitharan's figures of 8/70 earned him man of the match, and were his second best bowling figures recorded. Sri Lanka won the match by 134 runs and squared the series. They would go on to carry this momentum into the one day series that followed.\nLimited Over Matches.\nTour Match: Sri Lanka v Essex (9 June).\nEssex 174-4 (38) beat Sri Lanka 172 (43.3) by 6 wickets.\nTour Match: Sri Lanka v Somerset (11 June).\nSomerset 332-6 (50) beat Sri Lanka 281 (46.3) by 51 runs\nFifth ODI.\nSri Lanka completed their 5-0 rout of England's underperforming one day side in a dramatic and brutal fashion. Although England had recorded their highest score of the series batting first - 321/7, the Sri Lankans were enjoying such a rich streak of success that this normally challenging total posed no real threat.\nEngland batted first having won the toss, and looked to be putting themselves in a strong position, guided by a century from Marcus Trescothick. Alastair Cook and Vikram Solanki also had scores in the 40s, and 321/7 seemed a reasonable total at the halfway stage.\nHowever, any hopes that the 5-0 whitewash would be averted were quickly dispelled by Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga, who both launched into the bowling attack which they knew had had its confidence already battered from the previous encounters of the series.\nThe first ten overs of the Sri Lankan reply yielded an amazing 133 runs. Andrew Strauss kept turning to different bowlers, even calling on the spin of Jamie Dalrymple as early as the 8th over in a futile attempt to stem the flow of runs. But Jayasuriya and Tharanga were unstoppable, and although their scoring rates tapered off slightly when fielding restrictions were lifted, they continued on their merry way and racked up an enormous partnership of 286, which was broken in the 32nd over - with only 36 more needed to win at this point.\nJayasuriya brought up his century in 72 balls, and Tharanga in 82. Tharanga was caught and bowled by Dalrymple for 109 with the score on 286/1, and Jayasuriya went 4 balls later for an outstanding 152 off just 99 balls.\nKumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene had over 17 overs left to score the remaining 33 runs, and the victory was completed soon after. The target of 322 was chased down with 12.3 overs to spare, and the whitewash complete."

        "title": "Freestyle skateboarding tricks",
        "text": "A freestyle skateboarding trick is a trick performed with a skateboard while freestyle skateboarding. Some of these tricks are done in a stationary position, unlike many other skateboarding tricks. The keys to a good freestyle contest run are variety, difficulty, fluidity, and creativity. This is an incomplete list, which includes most notable tricks.\nStanding tricks.\nThese tricks involve stationary balancing.\n50/50 Truckstand/pogo.\nA 50/50 truckstand is when the board is balanced nearly vertical with the back foot standing on the truck and the front hand holding the nose. The typical way to perform a 50/50 truckstand is to put the board into nosestop, grasp the board with the back hand, jump and toss it to the front hand and land with the back foot on the truck, then execute a half-finger flip to land it.\nCasper.\nA freestyle stance where the skateboard is upside down and balanced on the point of the tail. The skater's back foot is on the underside of the tail and the front foot is hooked under the deck (touching the front foot to the ground is not a proper Casper). Named for inventor Bobby \"Casper\" Boyden.\nWhile performing this trick, some skateboarders will drop the front part of the board and repeatedly catch it with the front foot, which grabs the attention of spectators due to the rhythm and noise.\nRailstand.\nIn a Railstand, the skateboard is balanced on one edge with the rider standing on the opposite edge, usually with the feet also on the wheels. This position can be used as a set-up for many other tricks, and was invented in the 1970s by Bobby \"Casper\" Boyden.\nA Heelside Railstand is to stand on the board in railstand, with the griptape facing the rider's back, and a Toeside Railstand is the reverse. A common variation is a Cooperstand, which is a Railstand with one foot on a wheel and the other on the nose. \nHandstand.\nA handstand on a skateboard. Many variations evolved from this, including One-Handed Handstands, Headstands, Frogstands, Handstand Wheelies, Handstand Pivots, Handstand Handflips and Fingerflips, Railstand Handstands, etc. Also TV Stands, which are Handstands done in a 50/50.\nStreet Plant.\nA hand-plant trick in which the rider holds the board in one hand, does a one-handed handstand, puts the board under the feet, then comes down on top of the board. It is used as a fancy way to get onto one's board. This is like an Invert on Vert, but done on flatground.\nA difficult variation is the YoYo Plant, done without the feet touching the ground. It is usually done by rolling fakie with one hand planted on the ground as the other grabs the board. This is one of numerous variations developed by Joachim \"YoYo\" Schulz.\nThe HoHo Plant involves a handstand with both hands on the ground and the board resting on the feet. The YoHo Plant begins with a YoYo Plant then places the free hand on the ground to take the HoHo stance. The trick is often seen performed by Terry Synnott.\nSpins.\n360 Spin.\n1970s skate competitions such as the ones shown in \"Lords of Dogtown\" would often have an event to see who could do the most consecutive 360 spins on a skateboard. Variations include one-foot spins (on the nose or tail, or grabbing the foot while spinning), two-foot spins (on the nose or tail), crossfoot spins, two-board spins, etc.\nBigspin.\nA trick in which the board rotates 360-degrees while the skateboarder turns 180 degrees in the same direction above it. If the skateboarder rotates in the opposite direction of the skateboard it is called Anti-Bigspin. This can be done in any direction from any position, and in freestyle is often done following a Casper.\nHigher rotations are possible, with the rotation of the board noted before the name of the trick; e.g.: a 540 Bigspin combines a 540 Shove-It and a 180 turn of the body.\nGazelle.\nA Gazelle is a 540-degree rotation of the board while the rider spins 360 degrees in the same direction above it. It is usually done off the front end of the board and spun backside while travelling forwards, but can be done in any direction and combined with flips. Effectively, this is the next step up from a Bigspin.\nShove-it.\nA Shove-it is a 180-degree spin (instead of a flip) of the board. The name may have qualifiers added to describe the direction of spin (frontside or backside) or a higher amount of spin. In freestyle, the trick is usually performed off the front of the board while riding forwards, which helps ensure flat and fast spins. In streetstyle, Shove-Its are often popped (called a Pop Shuvit) from either end of the board. Frontside or backside rotations are possible. A Shove-it should spin totally flat, in contrast to an Impossible which should spin totally vertical.\nWalk The Dog.\nA footwork trick which spins the board. The front foot is positioned in the middle of the board while the back foot steps to the nose and brings it backwards, spinning the board 180 degrees. With practice, this trick can be done in quick repetition – or backwards – though a slow performance can create an illusion of speed.\nPivots.\nEnd-Over.\nAn End-Over is a series of 180-degree pivots, beginning on the nose (or the tail when rolling fakie). Pressure is placed on the nose to lift the back wheels, then the rider quickly turns 180 degrees (frontside or backside), pivoting on the nose while maintaining speed and direction of travel. One pilot is immediately followed by another in the opposite rotation; when these pivots are done in consecutive lines, they are considered End-Overs (end-over-end). It is not uncommon to mix more difficult pivots in to a sequence of End-Overs, such as a 360 pivot or one-foot pivot.\nA Jaywalk is an advanced version of the End-Over, in which the foot not performing the pivot is lifted clear of the board and brought to step down at the location the board will be after completing the pivot. This was invented by Brian Remmer.\nIn the Monster Walk version, instead of alternating pivots, the rider pivots frontside and frontside or backside and backside (fakie), giving the appearance of taking very large steps forward or backward.\nFlips.\nFlip tricks impart momentum to the unweighted board while the skater jumps, and may be used to reorient the board to a desirable position for landing.\nButter Flip.\nThe Butter Flip is executed following a Heelside Railstand. Both feet hop to one side of the board, side by side with no more than a gap. The rider puts pressure onto the end of the board, using the foot that is not on the wheel. This pops the board up, allowing it to be grasped with the hand opposite the foot which applied pressure. This trick is used to transition from Heelside Railstand to a Pogo or 50/50. The board can also be caught with the foot, making it a Butter Flip to a No Handed 50/50. The trick is named for its inventor, Keith Butterfield.\nFingerflip.\nA Fingerflip uses a flick of the fingers to flip the skateboard. Typically, the rider rolls forward, grabs the nose of the board with the front hand, then simultaneously jumps and flips the unweighted board with their hand. The rider will then come down on the board or catch the board in mid-air. There are numerous variations including the Double Fingerflip, Varial Fingerflip, Backhand Fingerflip, and 360 Fingerflip, and Fakie versions of these. Ollie Fingerflip variations are considered to be more difficult because the rider must Ollie before initiating the Fingerflip. Professional freestyler Darryl Grogan is known for his Ollie 360 Fingerflip, and Rodney Mullen is known to use an Ollie Varial Fingerflip in many of his runs and videos.\nNote that fingerflips are different from handflips, which involve grabbing the edge of the board and use the full hand to throw the board into a flip.\nKickflip.\nThis trick begins with the rider positioned with feet side-by-side pointed toward the nose; one foot (typically the back foot) is hooked around the edge of the board. The opposite foot pushes down and the hooked foot kicks sideways as the rider jumps, the rider's body turning to land in a normal riding position. Invented by Curt Lindgren. \nThe feet should never touch the ground in the trick, and turning the hooked foot so that it points directly at the other foot is technically an underflip and considered bad form. Variations include Doubleflips, Varial Flips, 360 Flips and M-80s.\nKickback.\nA trick involving a half flip backwards followed by one half or one-and-a-half flips forwards. From a stance with the front foot on the front bolts and the toes of the back foot along the heelside edge in the middle of the board, it can be accomplished by pushing down on the toes of the back foot, then jumping, kicking the board forwards, and catching it on the grip tape.\nHops and jumps.\nOllie.\nThe Ollie is a trick in which the rider and board leap into the air without use of the rider's hands. The rider stomps on the tail of the board to bring it mostly vertical, jumps, bends the knees as the skateboard springs up, and slides the front foot forward to level the skateboard at the peak of the jump. It was originally developed by Alan \"Ollie\" Gelfand in a bowl, and brought to flat ground by Rodney Mullen. It is considered a fundamental skill in skateboarding, needed to leap onto, over, or off of obstacles.\nA Nollie (short for \"nose ollie\") is the most common variation of an Ollie, reversing the roles of the two legs so that the front foot pops the nose to the ground and the rear foot guides the board.\nPogo.\nA trick in which the skateboard is used like a pogo stick. The board is held vertical against the boarder's legs, with one foot on the bottom truck and one or both hands holding the nose to lift the board up as the rider hops. It can also be done by squeezing the board between both legs in a no-handed variant, or stood with one foot on the truck and the other crossed over behind it with the toes of that foot pushing against the griptape for a cross-footed pogo.\nA Switchfoot Pogo is performed by alternating the foot on the truck with each of a series of continuous Pogo hops, so that it looks like the skater is walking on the truck.\nSlides and grinds.\nSlides and grinds involve riding the skateboard as it moves across a ledge or rail on its board (slides) or trucks (grinds). \nPrimo Slide.\nThis trick requires balancing like a Railstand but is done while moving, with the side of the board sliding along the ground. Invented by Primo Desiderio, the original version involved sliding backside 180 degrees, but many skaters now hold them in a straight line, flipping into and out of them.\nCoconut Wheelie, Coco Slide.\nA Coconut Wheelie or Coco Slide is like a Primo Slide but the deck never touches the ground, instead being held in a Wheelie on the side. This trick was invented by coach Vince W. Variations include handstands, grabs, transfer to spacewalk, etc.\nOther transitions.\nCalf Wrap (Flamingo/Figure Four).\nA trick in which the skater uses one foot to wrap the board around the calf of their opposite leg, which is planted on the ground, then unwraps it to land in a riding position. An earlier version of this trick was called \"Flamingo\" or \"Figure Four\" for the stance of the legs in mid-trick, with the board touching the inside knee or thigh. This was not often used until the faster calf-wrap version was developed to accommodate a backside 180 re-entry on banks and ramps. The trick was invented by Derek Belen, and developed and popularized by Mike Vallely, Rey Gregorio, Dorian Tucker and Kris Markovich.\nManual.\nA Manual is a trick similar to a bicycle wheelie where the skateboarder balances with only the front or the back wheels touching the ground. Manuals can be done with either or both feet or on a single wheel. A Manual in which both feet are straight on the nose is called a Hang Ten; its tail counterpart is called a Heelie. English Manuals place the back foot at the back bolts and the front foot underneath the nose, hooking the board up until balance is achieved. The Swedish Manual (likely named after Stefan \"Lillis\" Akesson) places the front foot on the nose pointing forward and the back toes are used to hook the tail up in a Nose Manual.\nA G-Turn is a Nose Manual, but without facing the riding direction. The rider increases speed, then places the front foot on the nose while keeping the back foot over the back wheels. While riding, the board tends to turn frontside or backside, ending with a spin.\nVariations: One-Wheeled, Backward, Hang Ten (two feet on the nose)\nCurrently, the world record for the longest manual is held by Jacob Taylor - performed in 2015. \nImpossible.\nIn an Impossible, the board wraps vertically over the back foot in a 360-degree rotation. An early version of the trick (now called a Nosehook Impossible) involved hooking the front foot under the nose to lift the board before the back foot began its scoop; later, Rodney Mullen developed the technique by popping in an Ollie from a regular riding position. There are many variations of both the Nosehook Impossible and the Ollie Impossible. Darryl Grogan was the first to land Impossibles Crossfooted, Halfcab, and to make a one-foot landing, while Mullen has done many variations off the nose, known as Nollie Impossibles.\nCombination tricks.\nBroken Fingers.\nThis is a Half Truckhook Impossible caught in a 50/50. The rider stands on the tail, puts the front foot under the board, and jumps backwards while scooping the board in front. This will cause the board to flip upside-down. The rider catches the tail of the board with the front hand and lands with the foot which was under the board on the truck. This trick got the name \"Broken Fingers\" due to the danger involved: failing to jump high enough or lean back sufficiently on the landing can result in crushed fingers. A no-handed version of this trick is referred to as a crossfooted Half Truckhook Impossible caught into a No-Handed 50/50.\nCasper Disaster.\nAlso invented by Bobby \"Casper\" Boyden, this trick has no relation to the Casper stance. While rolling fakie or nollie, the skater enters a Heelside Railstand one footed. The foot that is not touching the wheel will point down and nudge the griptape side of the skateboard while the rider spins 180 degrees towards the direction of the trucks. After the board and rider have rotated 180 degrees, the feet work together to nudge the skateboard down into a rolling position.\nCarousel.\nThis is a specific truck-to-truck transfer, which may be considered as a half Impossible from a 50/50 to a switch 50/50 – still standing on the back foot. The rider starts from a 50/50, \"throws\" the board over the foot that stands on the truck and jumps up. When the board has done the \"half wrap\", the rider lands on the truck and catches the nose of the board with the same hand used to flip it. In 2014, Marco Sassi became the first person to do a 360 Carousel, completing a full impossible around the foot to land back in the original 50/50 position. (By July 2015 only two other freestylers have accomplished this.)\nFan Flip.\nA Fan Flip begins from a Pogo stance. The rider jumps up, fingerflips (typically with the front hand), and kicks to the side, landing on the truck in a Pogo stance (usually on the same side).\nA no-handed fan flip begins from a no-handed pogo or no-handed 50/50, uses a fingerflip and ends in a no-handed 50/50.\nGingersnap.\nWhile in a Hang Ten (Manual) position, the skater pops down on the nose, causing the board to do a Nollie Hardflip motion, traveling vertically between the riders legs and landing back in normal position. If the half flip is done with a Nosegrab, the trick is referred to as a Bebop, named for Hazze Lindgren.\nGodzilla Flip.\nThis trick involves standing with one foot on the board in Tailstop and spinning the board in an Impossible around that foot with a hand. Either foot and either hand can be used, but neither foot should touch the ground. Not to be confused with the Godzilla Railflip, which is a Triple Varial Railflip with a Body Varial.\nHelipop.\nA backside 360 Nollie, performed by beginning a pivot just before initiating a Nollie, with the front foot on the nose of the board and the back foot in Nollie Heelflip position. Invented by Rodney Mullen. If a full 360 cannot be achieved, the rider may recover by landing in a 270 and pivoting the rest of the way on the back wheels. Variations: grabs, frontside, flips out.\nM-80.\nThis trick begins with a Kickflip, turning the rider's body in the air to catch the board with the back foot on the nose, pivoting 180 degrees on the front wheels before the back wheels hit the ground. It was invented by Matt Barden in 1980. Many variations have been developed, including a Nose M-80 (which omits the body varial and lands the front foot on the nose), fakie and double flip versions.\nNo Comply.\nIn this trick the front foot slides off the side of the board, with the body weight on the back foot over the tail; the board then snaps upwards and the rider jumps, guiding the board with the back leg or knee, and returns the front foot into contact with the board. This trick has many variations, including 180, 360, Varials, Flips, Fingerflips, Impossibles, etc. Ray Barbee is noted as a master of No Comply variations to many who have watched the earlier Powell videos.\nOllie Airwalk.\nThis trick is a combination of an Ollie with an Airwalk. The rider initiates an Ollie and grabs the board with the front hand, while kicking the front foot forward and the back foot backwards (diagonal to the riding direction). This trick was invented by Rodney Mullen, and has many variations, including fingerflips and 180 spins.\nPressure Flip.\nThis is a flip using only one foot (either), with the board launched into the air and flipped with one motion. Like Ollie Flips, Pressure Flips can be done nollie or fakie in any combination of flipping and rotational directions. The trick most commonly spins backside, flipping in a heelflip direction, resulting in something similar to an Inward Heelflip.\nSan Francisco Flip.\nThe San Francisco Flip is a type of a Truck-To-Transfer where the rider enters a No-Handed 50/50 and does a No-Handed Carousel to a Crossfoot No-Handed 50/50. Invented by Guenter Mokulys.\nSaran Wrap/Wrap Around.\nInvented by Rodney Mullen, and usually done from a Pogo or a 50/50, this trick involves the front leg tracing a circle around the nose of the board without touching the ground. Experienced skaters can do several Saran Wraps continuously.\nScarewalk.\nA scarewalk is a back-handed Airwalk, resulting in the board being held in close proximity to the rider's crotch (hence the name). It is sometimes erroneously thought to merely be an Airwalk with the legs kicked in the opposite direction.\nSidewinder.\nA truck-to-truck transfer where the rider switches from a pogo on one truck to a pogo on the other truck with the board upside-down throughout. During the trick, the board turns over about 90 degrees. Variations: switch foot, same foot and flips.\nSpacewalk.\nAnother kind of \"Walk\" in freestyle skateboarding. The rider enters a Manual on two wheels and swings the other end of the board from side-to-side; the other set of wheels should not touch the ground during the trick. The wider the swing, the better the Spacewalk looks. The Many variations exist including Nose Spacewalks, Hang Ten Spacewalks, Backward Spacewalks, One-Knee-Kneeled Spacewalks (invented by Günter Mokulys) and many more.\nTV Stand.\nA TV Stand is a handstand done in a 50/50. While in a 50/50 or Pogo, the rider grabs the bottom truck (the one with the back foot on) and performs a handstand with the other hand holding the nose of the board. The trick is landed by doing a half flip. A variation when grabbing the top truck is called a \"Jawbreaker\", invented by Primo Desiderio.\nVarial kickflip/heelflip.\nA kickflip or heelflip with a twist; the kickflip is combined with a backside shove-it, and a heelflip is combined with a frontside one.\nMultiple-board tricks.\nPlacing two, three, or more boards on top of each other can increase the rebound forces and expand the achievable jump height for novice skaters. It is also possible to increase the difficulty by making real tricks out of stacked boards: multiple-board handstands, multiple-board flipouts, ollie to multiple boards, rock'n'roll to multiple-board slide, multiple-board wheelie, etc.\nSpecific multiple-board tricks include:\nDaffy.\nThis trick is done with two boards, one foot in a tailwheelie on one board and the other foot on the second board in a nosewheelie. It is one of the oldest freestyle tricks and has been featured in the Girl Skateboards video \"Yeah Right!\", Gus Van Sant's film \"Paranoid Park\", and the \"Lords of Dogtown\" movie. The Tony Hawk's Underground game calls this a Yeah Right Manual.\nVariations include rollerskate-like double-board tailwheelies and double-board nosewheelies, crossfoot wheelies and spins, and a one-foot double-board daffy. It's also possible to \"lose\" one of the boards and continue with a one-foot wheelie."

Aerials usually combine rotation with different grabs. Most of the different types of grabs were originally aerial tricks that were performed in ditches, empty pools, and vert ramps before flatground aerials became common. Aerials can be executed by ollieing just as the front wheels reach the lip of a ramp, or can be executed simply by lifting the front wheels over the coping (or lip). The former is preferable on shallower ramps where the skateboarder has less speed to lift them above the ramp."

It has won the Brazilian Rugby Championship in three occasions: 1996, 2000 and 2005.\nHistory.\nDesterro's history began in 1994, when a group of young men got together with the Portuguese Miguel Caçote, who had many years of experience in rugby. The first practices took place at “Joaquina” Beach, as the group didn't have a place to practice, and this beach was the only one in the island at the time with illumination. Desterro's first game was played in Curitiba, and the local team won. Still in 1994, the first rugby game ever was played in Santa Catarina State, and it was also Desterro's first victory, by 32 x 29.\nIn 1995 Desterro was founded as a Rugby Club in legal terms, and had its first contacts with Brazilian Rugby Association. In the year of 1996, the First Floripa Beach Rugby Sevens took place in “Jurerê Internacional” Beach, played by most of the mayor Brazilian Clubs. In the next year, some clubs from Argentina and Uruguay also took part in the tournament, and Desterro was the champion. In July 1996 Desterro had its first International Tour, staying for ten days in the Argentine towns of Buenos Aires and La Plata, playing against traditional Clubs as SIC (San Isidro Club – Buenos Aires), Universitario, Los Tilos and San Luís (La Plata).\nIn the second semester Desterro played for the first time the Brazilian Rugby Championship and became for the first time the Brazilian Rugby Champion, beating the strong Bandeirantes side by 24 x21 in São Paulo. In the year 2000 Desterro was once again Brazilian Champion, this time beating the favorites São José in São José dos Campos, by 21 x 20. Desterro's third Brazilian Championship came in 2005, with another victory over São José (16x10), this time in São Paulo.\nIn 1998, Desterro's Junior side became Brazilian Rugby Junior's Champion and the women's side played for the first time a tournament at national level. It was in Campos do Jordão, and Desterro was the champion. Desterro is the organizer of the annual \"Floripa Rugby Sevens\", played in February, with teams from Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.\nMain titles.\nAdult Male:\nAdult Female:\nJuvenile Male:"

        "title": "Grind (skateboarding)",
        "text": "In skateboarding, grinds are tricks that involve the skateboarder sliding along a surface, making contact with the trucks of the skateboard. Grinds can be performed on any object narrow enough to fit between wheels and are performed on curbs, rails, the coping of a skate ramp, funboxes, ledges, and a variety of other surfaces.\nHistory.\nThe move likely originated in backyard pools in the early 1970s, as the early skaters gained in skill and confidence with their high speed carves around the top of the pool walls and one day went that \"little bit\" too high . The trucks of the time, often being merely 'borrowed' rollerskate trucks, didn't allow much contact due to their narrowness, but as skateboarding gained its own truck manufacturers who widened the hanger design, the possibilities for exploration became apparent, and all sorts of moves started popping up . There was a big leap in street skating starting in the 1990s . It has evolved ever since. Today, grinds are commonly performed on handrails, lips of benches, tables, hubbas (ledge on a slope), on a hard normal ledge, a flatbar, or just simply anything that is possible enough to grind on it.\nProperty damage.\nGrinding is damaging to materials which are not hardened for the specific purpose of the sport, as may be found in a skate park. The trucks are composed of a hard metal without lubricant or bearings on the grinding surface, so they literally do grind on the objects they slide across. Grinding can strip paint off of steel and wear down the edges of concrete, stone, aluminum, and wood building materials. Affected business owners and government buildings have put up anti-skate devices as a deterrent to grinding. Grinding in public places may be seen as a form of vandalism and may cause skateboarding to be banned by business owners and city ordinances.\nBack-side or front-side.\nWhether a grind is back-side (BS) or front-side (FS) depends on how rider approaches the rail or edge. If the skater approaches the rail with his back to it, the grind is a back-side grind. If the skater approaches the rail with the front of his body to the rail, the grind is a front-side grind."

        "text": "The Chicago Hounds were a minor professional ice hockey team in the United Hockey League (UHL) for the 2006–07 UHL season. They played their home games at the Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, Illinois.\nThe new UHL team was approved for a new arena in Hoffman Estates in early 2005 to be owned by Dr. Eric Margenau, a New York-based psychologist who also owned several other minor league teams including the Chicago Slaughter indoor football team. On January 31, 2006, Robbie Nichols was announced to be leaving his post as coach of the Richmond RiverDogs, which was also owned by Dr. Margenau, to start up the new UHL team in Chicago. The Hounds franchise was then officially a relocation of the RiverDogs after the owners did not renew their lease in Richmond.\nNichols left the Chicago franchise in April 2006 to become head coach and general manager of the Elmira Jackals and the manager of First Arena in Elmira, New York. The Hounds then hired former Fort Wayne Komets' coach Greg Puhalski, who came in as the head coach with the most wins in UHL history. The Hounds got off to an inauspicious start as their first home game was canceled due to bad ice at the brand new Sears Centre. The game was supposed to start at 7:30pm Central Time, but the decision to cancel was not announced until 9pm. Several fans were alleged to have thrown rubber pucks for the Chuck-A-Puck promotion in the direction of UHL commissioner Richard Brosal, who was the one that made the official announcement to the fans.\nLate in the 2006–07 season, the Hounds were sold to Craig Drecktrah, owner of the UHL's Rockford IceHogs. On June 6, 2007, Drecktrah ceased the team's operations citing his inability to negotiate a reasonable lease with the Sears Centre. Drecktrah stated the Sears Centre wanted him to take mostly weekdays, leaving the more desirable weekend dates for the other tenants. He also said the building management wanted to triple the cost of his lease. The team attempted to resume play in the UHL, which had rebranded International Hockey League, for the 2008–09 season, but Drecktrah was unable to secure a venue in the Chicago area.\nIn 2010, it was announced that Drecktrah would be bringing an ECHL team, the Chicago Express, to the Sears Centre, which competed in the 2011–12 season before ceasing operations."

        "text": "The International Volleyball Hall of Fame (IVHF) was founded to honor extraordinary players, coaches, officials, and leaders who have made significant contributions to the game of volleyball. The Hall of Fame is located in Holyoke, Massachusetts, where volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan at the local YMCA.\nHistory.\nIn 1971, the Greater Holyoke Chamber of Commerce established a committee to campaign for the founding of the Volleyball Hall of Fame in Holyoke, Massachusetts.\nBy 1977, the city of Holyoke installed signs declaring the location as the \"Home of the Volleyball Hall of Fame\". However, the advertised attraction was merely a small display case of memorabilia that alternated between being hosted by the Chamber of Commerce and Wistariahurst Museum. In 1978, the committee incorporated as Holyoke Volleyball Hall of Fame, The Volleyball Hall of Fame aims to preserve and promote the history, culture, and values of volleyball while honoring the outstanding athletes, coaches, referees, administrators, and other influential figures associated with the sport. \nA small exhibit dedicated to the history of volleyball and the hall of fame's inductees opened in a section of the renovated Skinner Mill Warehouse on June 6, 1987 - a building built in 1949 to store silk fabric produced by the famous Skinner Mill in Holyoke. The mill itself was destroyed by fire in 1980.\nIn 1998, the exhibit was expanded and moved to a permanent location in the Skinner Mill Warehouse in downtown Holyoke's Heritage State Park sharing the building with the Holyoke Children's Museum.\nThe IVHF museum now features exhibits honoring each year's inductees, a replica of a full-size volleyball court, sport timelines, photos, and unique and meaningful memorabilia of the sport along with an interactive video kiosk, a special inductee display area, and a gift shop.\nIn 1985, William G. Morgan (inventor of volleyball) was posthumously inducted into the hall as its first member. A total of 140 men and women from 25 countries around the world have since been inducted into the International Volleyball Hall of Fame.\nCurrent inductees (147 persons).\nThe following tables, pre-sorted chronologically, enumerate all of the inductees to the Volleyball Hall of Fame through 2019.\nInductees by country (26 countries).\nThe following table enumerates all of the inductees to the Volleyball Hall of Fame through 2018."

        "title": "Foul (basketball)",
        "text": "In basketball, a foul is an infraction of the rules more serious than a violation. Most fouls occur as a result of illegal personal contact with an opponent and/or unsportsmanlike behavior. Fouls can result in one or more of the following penalties:\nSome of the penalties listed above are assessed only if a player or a team commits a number of fouls above a specified limit.\nOrdinary fouls are routine because of the constant motion inherent in the sport and are not viewed as bad sportsmanship. The penalty imposes a cost on violating the rules but does not disparage the player committing the foul. A player intending never to commit a foul might play so cautiously as to be ineffective. More serious fouls are regarded as bad sportsmanship, and the penalties are designed to be disciplinary.\nThere are several classes of foul, each enumerated below and covered in greater detail in its own article.\nClasses.\nPersonal.\nA personal foul is the most common type of foul. It results from personal contact between two opposing players.\nBasketball features constant motion, and contact between opposing players is unavoidable, but significant contact that is the fault of illegal conduct by one opponent is a foul against that player. Most personal fouls are called against a defensive player. A personal foul that is committed by a player of the team in possession of the ball is called an offensive foul. When neither team is in clear possession of the ball, a foul is called a loose-ball foul.\nFlagrant.\nA flagrant foul is violent player contact that the official believes is not a legitimate attempt to directly play the ball within the rules.\nTechnical.\nA technical foul is a foul unrelated to physical contact during gameplay. The foul may be called on a player in the game, another player, a coach, or against the team in general. This class of foul applies to all of the following:\nIn the last two cases, the rules may call for the referee to give a warning rather than assess a technical foul on the first infraction.\nPlayer and team.\nA player foul is any foul, but typically personal and flagrant fouls, by reference to the count of fouls charged against a given player. A team foul is any foul by reference to the count against a given team.\nBonus situation.\nThe bonus (or penalty) situation occurs when one team accumulates a requisite number of fouls. When one team has committed the requisite number of fouls, each subsequent foul results in the opposing team's taking free throws regardless of the type of foul committed.\nCoach's challenge.\nBeginning in the 2019–20 season, the NBA introduced the \"coach's challenge\" rule, allowing teams one challenge per game. Teams may only challenge personal foul calls on its own players, and out-of-bounds and goaltending/basket interference calls during the first 46 minutes of the game and first 3 minutes of overtime play. Teams must call a legal timeout to challenge a call, which will be returned if the challenge is successful. When a call is challenged, instant replay footage is reviewed by game officials to determine whether the call should be overturned. Previously, teams were only allowed one challenge per game regardless of whether the challenge was successful. However, beginning in the 2023-2024 season teams are allowed one additional challenge provided that their first challenge is successful.\nStarting in the 2021–22 season, coaches in the Euroleague and EuroCup Basketball are given one challenge per game.\nOn October 1, 2022, FIBA published a revision of its official rules of basketball adding a \"head coach challenge\". Similar to the NBA and Euroleague, each coach is given one challenge per game."

        "text": "Warren H. Wolf (August 1, 1927 – November 22, 2019) was an American high school football head coach who coached at Brick Township High School in Brick Township, New Jersey. He was also a Republican politician who served as a Brick Township school board member, councilman, mayor, Ocean County freeholder, and New Jersey State Assemblyman.\nEarly life.\nWolf was born in Jersey City and grew up in West New York. While attending Memorial High School, he played on the school's football team. He served in the United States Navy in 1945 and 1946. Following his military service, he graduated from Seton Hall University in 1949 and received an M.A. degree from Columbia University in 1952.\nFootball coaching career.\nWolf's football career began in the 1940s coaching a semi-professional football team in West New York before moving to Memorial High School where he was an assistant coach for 10 years. With the upcoming birth of his second child, in 1958 Wolf moved to Brick Township where he began coaching their high school's fledgling football program, the Brick Green Dragons.\nAs head coach of the Green Dragons, Wolf achieved a career record of 361-122-11. Wolf has the most wins of any coach in the history of public high school football in New Jersey. Former coach Vic Paternostro of Pope John, a private school, became the state's all-time winningest coach in 2009 when he passed Wolf and retired with 373 wins. As of the start of the 2006 football season, Wolf ranked fourth in the nation of coaches by number of seasons coached and holds the New Jersey record for most years as a football coach.\nWolf began his coaching career in 1958 and had just three losing seasons. In his 51 seasons at Brick, he had won or shared 24 Shore Conference divisional championships as well 13 state sectional titles (seven of which were awarded before playoffs were instituted).\nOn December 1, 2008, after 51 seasons, Wolf officially retired as the head coach of the Brick Township High School Football Dragons.\nOn January 25, 2010, after one year away from coaching, Wolf was named head coach of Lakewood High School. Wolf was looking to resurrect what had been one of the worst teams in the Shore Conference for the last decade. Lakewood sits just to the west of Brick, and the two high schools are a few miles apart. The schools used to share a healthy football rivalry, but haven't played each other since Brick defeated Lakewood 65–6 in 2003. ESPN followed Wolf's one-year journey as Lakewood's head coach in a documentary series.\nGovernment.\nWolf has also been involved in local and state government, serving as the Mayor of Brick Township from 1971 to 1975, a member of the Ocean County Board of Chosen Freeholders from 1975 to 1981, a member of the New Jersey General Assembly from 1981 to 1983 from the 10th legislative district, a Brick Township Council member from 1982 to 1993, and a member of the Board of Education of the Brick Public Schools for one year in 2010.\nLegacy.\nIn 2019, he was voted by NJO as the 18th greatest coach in New Jersey history.\nIn 2008, Wolf was elected to the New Jersey Sports Writers Association (NJSWA) Hall of Fame.\nWolf died on November 22, 2019, at the Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune Township at the age of 92. Only one month after his death, his beloved wife Peggy died at the age of 89."

        "title": "History of the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The FIFA World Cup was first held in 1930, when FIFA, the world's football governing body, decided to stage an international men's football tournament under the era of FIFA president Jules Rimet who put this idea into place. Jules Rimet was the president of FIFA from 1921 to 1954. Rimet was appreciated so much for bringing the idea of FIFA to life that 1946 the trophy was named the Jules Rimet Cup instead of the World Cup Trophy. The inaugural edition, held in 1930, was contested as a final tournament of only thirteen teams invited by the organization. Since then, the World Cup has experienced successive expansions and format remodeling, with its current 48-team final tournament preceded by a two-year qualifying process, involving over 200 teams from around the world.\nInternational football before 1930.\nThe first official international football match was played in 1872 in Glasgow between Scotland and England, although at this stage the sport was rarely played outside Great Britain.\nAt the end of the 19th century, games that were considered the \"football world championship\" were meetings between leading English and Scottish clubs, like the 1895 game between Sunderland A.F.C. and the Heart of Midlothian F.C., which Sunderland won.\nBy the twentieth century, football had gained ground all around the world and national football associations were being founded. The first official international match outside the British Isles was played between Uruguay and Argentina in Montevideo in July 1902. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in Paris on 22 May 1904 – comprising football associations from France, Belgium (the preceding two teams having played their first national against each other earlier in the month), Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, with Germany pledging to join.\nAs football began to increase in popularity, it was contested as an IOC-recognized Olympic sport at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics, as well as at the 1906 Intercalated Games, before becoming an official FIFA-supervised Olympic competition at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Organised by England's Football Association, the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. The England national amateur football team won the event in both 1908 and 1912.\nThere was an attempt made by FIFA to organize an international football tournament between nations outside of the Olympic framework in 1906 and this took place in Switzerland. These were very early days for international football and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.\nWith the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, competitions involving professional teams also started to appear. The Torneo Internazionale Stampa Sportiva, held in Turin in 1908, was one of the first, and the following year; Sir Thomas Lipton organized the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, also held in Turin. Both tournaments were contested between individual clubs (not national teams), each one of which represented an entire nation. For this reason, neither was really a direct forerunner of the World Cup, but notwithstanding that, the Thomas Lipton Trophy is sometimes described as \"The First World Cup\", at the expense of its less well-known Italian predecessor.\nIn 1914, FIFA agreed to recognize the Olympic tournament as a \"world football championship for amateurs\", and took responsibility for organizing the event. This led the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, won by Belgium. Uruguay won the tournaments in 1924 and 1928.\nBeginning of the World Cup.\nIn 1930, FIFA made the decision to stage their own international tournament. The 1932 Summer Olympics, held in Los Angeles, did not plan to include football as part of the programme because the sport was not popular in the United States. FIFA and the IOC also disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the Games. FIFA president Jules Rimet thus set about organizing the inaugural World Cup tournament. With Uruguay now a two-time official world champion and due to celebrate its centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country. The national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for the European sides at the time of the Great Depression. No European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part – seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America.\nThe first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously and were won by France and the United States, who beat Mexico 4–1 and Belgium 3–0, respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France. Four days later, the first World Cup hat-trick was achieved by Bert Patenaude of the U.S. in the Americans' 3–0 win against Paraguay. In the final, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4–2 in front of a crowd of 93,000 people in Montevideo to become the first nation to win a World Cup.\nThe 1934 World Cup was hosted by Italy and was the first World Cup to include a qualification stage. Sixteen teams qualified for the tournament, a number which would be retained until the expansion of the finals tournament in 1982. Uruguay, the titleholders from 1930, still upset about the poor European attendance at their World Cup in 1930, boycotted the 1934 World Cup. Bolivia and Paraguay were also absent, allowing Argentina and Brazil to progress to the finals in Italy without having to play any qualifying matches. Egypt became the first African team to compete, but lost to Hungary in the first round. Italy won the tournament, becoming the first European team to do so.\nThe 1938 World Cup competition was also held in Europe (in France), much to the consternation of many South Americans, with Uruguay and Argentina boycotting. For the first time, the title holders and the host country were given automatic qualifications. Following a play-off match against Latvia, Austria had officially qualified for the final round, but because of the Anschluss in April 1938 with Germany, the Austrian national team withdrew, with some Austrian players being added to the German squad (which was eliminated in the first round). Austria's place was offered to England, but they declined. This left the finals with 15 nations competing. France hosted, but for the first time the hosts did not win the competition, as Italy retained their title, beating Hungary in the final. Polish striker Ernest Willimowski became the first player to score four goals in a World Cup game during Poland's 6–5 loss against Brazil; his record was later equalled by other players, but was not bettered until 56 years later in the 1994 World Cup.\nHiatus due to World War II.\nThe FIFA World Cup was planned to take place in 1942. Germany officially applied to host the 1942 FIFA World Cup at the 23rd FIFA Congress on 13 August 1936 in Berlin. In June 1939, Brazil also applied to host the tournament. The beginning of European hostilities in September 1939 prompted further plans for the 1942 World Cup to be cancelled, before a host country was selected. The FIFA tournament did not take place.\nDuring World War II, FIFA struggled to keep itself afloat, and it had no financial or personnel resources with which to plan a peacetime tournament for when hostilities ended. When the war ended in 1945, it was clear that FIFA would have no hope in a single year of planning and scheduling a 1946 World Cup. In fact, FIFA's first meeting was on 1 July 1946 – around the time the 1946 World Cup would ordinarily have been played – and when it planned the next World Cup for 1949 no country would host it. The only major international tournament in 1946 was the 1946 South American Championship in which Argentina beat Brazil 2–0 on 10 February 1946.\nPost-war years.\n1950s.\nCompetitions resumed with the 1950 World Cup in Brazil, which was the first to include British participants. British teams withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against a foreign influence to football, but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation. England's involvement, however, was not to be a success. The English failed to make the final group round in a campaign that included a surprise 1–0 loss to the United States.\nThe tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. For political reasons, Eastern European countries (such as Hungary, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia) did not enter. Title-holder Italy did take part, despite the Superga air disaster of 1949 in which the entire \"Grande Torino\" team (many of whom were national team players) were killed. The 1950 World Cup was the only tournament not to stage a final tie, replacing knockout rounds with two group phases. The last match of the second group phase, however, is sometimes referred to as a \"final\", as the group standings meant the winners would be the overall winners. Uruguay were surprise victors over hosts Brazil with a final score of 2–1 (the game would later be known as Maracanazo), and became champions for the second time. This game also held the record for the highest attendance at any sporting match, at roughly 200,000.\nThe 1954 World Cup, held in Switzerland, was the first to be televised. The Soviet Union did not participate because of their dismal performance at the 1952 Summer Olympics. Scotland made their first appearance in the tournament, but were unable to register a win, going out after the group stage. This tournament set a number of all-time goal-scoring records, including highest average goals per game and highest-scoring team (Hungary), and most goals in a single match (Austria's 7–5 quarter-final victory over Switzerland). West Germany were the tournament winners, defeating Olympic champions Hungary 3–2 in the final, overturning a 2–0 deficit in the process, with Helmut Rahn scoring the winner. The match is known as the Miracle of Bern in Germany.\nBrazil won the 1958 World Cup, held in Sweden, and became the first team to win a World Cup outside their home continent (only 4 teams have done this to date – Brazil in 1958, 1970, 1994 and 2002, Argentina in 1986 and 2022, Spain in 2010 and Germany in 2014). The Soviet Union participated this time, most likely due to their win at Melbourne 1956. For the first (and so far only) time, all four British teams qualified for the final round. Wales was able to take advantage of a situation in the Africa/Asia zone, where the number of withdrawals would give Israel qualification without having played a single qualifying match. This prompted FIFA to rule that qualification without playing was not allowed (despite allowing this to happen in earlier years of the Cup), and so Israel were ordered to play against one of the teams finishing second in the other groups. A tie was created, and Wales defeated Israel 2–0 twice in 1958. It was the first (and so far the only) time that a country played a World Cup final round after having been eliminated in the regular qualifiers. The tournament also saw the emergence of Pelé, who scored two goals in the final. French striker Just Fontaine became the top scorer of the tournament.\n1960s.\nChile hosted the 1962 World Cup. Two years before the tournament, an earthquake struck, the largest ever recorded at 9.5 magnitude, prompting officials to rebuild due to major damage to infrastructure. When the competition began, two of the best players were in poor form as Pelé was injured in Brazil's second group match against Czechoslovakia. Also, the Soviet Union saw their goalkeeper Lev Yashin show poor form including a 2–1 loss to hosts Chile as the hosts captured third place.\nThe competition was also marred by overly defensive and often violent tactics. This poisonous atmosphere culminated in what was known as the Battle of Santiago first round match between Italy and Chile in which Chile won 2–0. Prior to the match, two Italian journalists wrote unflattering articles about the host country. In the match, players on both sides made deliberate attempts to harm opponents though only two players from Italy were sent off by English referee Ken Aston. In the end, the Italian team needed police protection to leave the field in safety.\nWhen the final whistle blew, Brazil beat Czechoslovakia for the second World Cup in a row by a final of 3–1 led by Garrincha and Amarildo, in Pelé's absence, and retained the Jules Rimet trophy.\nColombia's Marcos Coll made World Cup history when he scored a goal direct from a corner kick (called an Olympic Goal in Latin America), the only one ever made in a World Cup, past legendary Soviet goalkeeper Lev Yashin.\nThe 1966 World Cup, hosted by England, was the first to embrace marketing, featuring a mascot and official logo for the first time. The trophy was stolen in the run-up to the tournament but was found a week later by a dog named \"Pickles\". South Africa was banned for violating the anti-discrimination charter (apartheid). The ban remained in effect until 1992 when the South Africa Football Association was finally accepted by FIFA. The qualifying rounds of the tournament saw a controversy when the African nations decided to withdraw in protest of only one qualifying place allocated by FIFA to the regions of Asia, Oceania and Africa. The eventual qualifiers from the zone, North Korea, became the first Asian team to reach the quarter-finals, eliminating Italy in the process. England won the tournament, although João Havelange (former FIFA president from 1974 to 1998) claimed that the 1966 and 1974 World Cups were fixed so that England and Germany would win respectively. Geoff Hurst became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup Final and Eusébio, whose team Portugal were taking part in their first World Cup, was the tournament top-scorer, with nine goals to his name.\n1970s.\nThe qualification stages of the 1970 World Cup were coincidental with the Football War between Honduras and El Salvador. The finals were held in Mexico. Israel had been with Europe, but due to political issues, it was becoming harder to place them adequately in the qualifying rounds. They were grouped in Asia/Oceania. Korea DPR then refused to meet them, even though this meant automatic disqualification. The group stage clash between defending champions England and Brazil lived up to its billing, and is still remembered for England goalkeeper Gordon Banks' save from a Pelé header on the six-yard line. The tournament is also remembered for the semi-final match between Italy and West Germany, in which five goals were scored in extra time, and Franz Beckenbauer played with a broken arm, since Germany had used up all their allowed substitutions. Italy were the eventual 4–3 winners, but were defeated 1–4 in the final by Brazil, who became the first nation to win three World Cups, and were awarded the Jules Rimet trophy permanently for their achievement.\nA new trophy was created for the 1974 edition, held in West Germany. After a draw in their first UEFA/CONMEBOL Intercontinental play-off match against Chile in the qualifiers, the Soviet Union refused to travel to the Chilean capital for the return fixture for political reasons, and in accordance with the regulations, Chile were awarded a victory. East Germany, Haiti, Australia and Zaire made their first finals. The tournament also saw a new format, where the two top teams from each of the earlier four groups were divided into two groups of four each again, the winner of either group playing each other in the final. The West German hosts won the competition by beating the Netherlands 2–1 in the final, but it was also the revolutionary Total Football system of the Dutch that captured the footballing world's imagination. The very well-playing Poland finished third, after defeating Brazil 1–0 (and after defeating Argentina 3–2 and eliminating Italy 2–1 in the initial group play), having barely lost in terrible rain in the semi-finals to West Germany 0–1.\nThe 1978 World Cup was held in Argentina, causing controversy as a military coup had taken place in the country two years earlier. Allegations that Dutch star Johan Cruyff refused to participate because of political convictions were refuted by him 30 years later. and none of the teams decided to stay away.\nThis was the hardest ever World Cup to qualify for. With 95 countries vying for 14 places (the holders and hosts qualified automatically), there were nearly seven teams competing for each place in Argentina. Hungary won their European group but still had to win a play-off against Bolivia to qualify, while England and Italy - the only former champions involved in European qualifying - were placed in the same group, with the result that England were eliminated on goal difference despite winning five of their six qualifying matches.\nIran and Tunisia were first-time participants. Tunisia won their first match against Mexico 3–1 and became the first African team to ever win a World Cup game. There was some on-field controversy as well. During the second round, Argentina had an advantage in their match against Peru since the kick off was several hours after Brazil's match with Poland. Brazil won their match 3–1, so Argentina knew that they had to beat Peru by four goals to advance to the final. Trailing 2–0 at half-time, Peru simply collapsed in the second half, and Argentina eventually won 6–0. Rumors suggested that Peru might have been bribed into allowing Argentina to win the match by such a large margin. Argentina went on to win the final 3–1, with the Dutch being runners-up for the second time in a row.\nLate 20th century.\n1980s.\nSpain hosted an expanded 1982 World Cup which featured 24 teams, the first expansion since 1934. The teams were divided into six groups of four, with the top two teams in each group advancing to the second round, where they split into four groups of three. The winners of each group advanced to the semi-finals. Cameroon, Algeria, Honduras, New Zealand and Kuwait were the debutants. The group match between Kuwait and France was stage of a farcical incident. As the French were leading 3–1, the Kuwaiti team stopped playing after hearing a whistle from the stands which they thought had come from referee, as French defender Maxime Bossis scored. As the Kuwaiti team were protesting the goal, Sheikh Fahid Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, president of the Kuwait Football Association, rushed onto the pitch and gave the referee a piece of his mind, who proceeded to disallow the goal. Bossis scored another valid goal a few minutes later and France won 4–1.\nAlso during the group stages, Hungary beat El Salvador 10–1, which has been the only occasion to this day that a team scored ten goals in a World Cup match. The group match between West Germany and Austria later resulted in a change of World Cup rules, after both teams visibly aimed to keep the qualification ensuring 1–0 scoreline over 80 minutes. The semi-final between West Germany and France saw another controversy when German keeper Harald Schumacher's challenge took out Patrick Battiston, with the score at 1–1. Schumacher escaped a red card, and Germany won in a penalty shoot-out, after coming back to level from having gone 1–3 down. The final was won by Italy, making Italian captain Dino Zoff the oldest player to win the World Cup. Italian striker Paolo Rossi, who was making his comeback after a match-fixing scandal and the ensuing ban, was the tournament top-scorer with six goals including a classic hat-trick against Brazil.\nBecause of Colombia's withdrawal to host the tournament, Mexico became the first nation to hold two World Cups by hosting the 1986 World Cup. The format changed again, with the second round being replaced by a pre-quarterfinal, knockout competition, for which 16 teams would qualify. It was also decided that the final two matches in all groups would kick off simultaneously, to ensure complete fairness. Canada, Denmark and Iraq made their first finals. José Batista of Uruguay set a World Cup record being sent off after a mere 56 seconds into the game against Scotland. The quarterfinal match between England and Argentina is remembered for two remarkable Diego Maradona goals, later regarded as player of the tournament, the first, the controversial handball goal, and the second, considered to be the Goal of the Century, in which he dribbled half the length of the field past five English players before scoring. In the final, Argentina beat West Germany 3–2, inspired by Diego Maradona, who set up Jorge Burruchaga for the winner.\n1990s.\nThe 1990 World Cup was held in Italy. Cameroon, participating in their second World Cup, made it to the quarter-finals after beating Argentina in the opening game. No African country had ever reached the quarter-finals before. Mexico was unable to compete in the 1990 World Cup preliminary competition as a result of a two-year ban for age fraud at a youth championship, an incident known as Los Cachirules. the United States qualified for the first time since 1950. An unpleasant episode marred the South American qualifiers: during the match between Brazil and Chile, a firework landed close to the Chilean goalkeeper Roberto Rojas, who then feigned injury by cutting his own face with a razor blade he had hidden in his glove. His team refused to continue the match (as they were down a goal at the time). The plot was discovered and resulted in a 12-year suspension for Rojas and to Chile being banned from the 1994 World Cup. The final featured the same teams as in 1986. After finishing runners-up in the two previous tournaments, West Germany beat Argentina 1–0 in the final to record their third title. The Republic of Ireland also made their first appearance in the tournament, reaching the quarter-finals without winning a single game (four draws, with a penalty shoot-out win over Romania in the second round). This is the furthest a team has ever advanced in the World Cup without winning a game.\nThe 1994 World Cup, held in the United States, saw the first World Cup final to be decided on penalties, with Brazil edging out Italy. FR Yugoslavia was excluded due to UN sanctions in connection with the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Colombia qualified unexpectedly defeating Argentina 5-0. Japan narrowly missed a ticket to the World Cup after drawing with Iraq in the final match of the qualification round, remembered by fans as the \"Agony of Doha\". As a result, South Korea qualified to the tournament. Russia (taking the place of the Soviet Union which had disintegrated over 1990 and 1991) played their first World Cup competition as a new country, with Greece, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia as the other first-timers. Diego Maradona was banned mid-tournament after testing positive for cocaine: without him, Argentina were eliminated in the last 16 by Romania. Despite soccer's relative lack of popularity in the host nation, the tournament was the most financially successful in World Cup history; it broke tournament records with overall attendance of 3,587,538 and an average of 68,991 per match, marks that stood unbroken as of 2018 despite the expansion of the competition from 24 to 32 teams starting with the 1998 World Cup.\nThe total attendance for the tournament of nearly 3.6 million remains the biggest in World Cup history. Oleg Salenko of Russia became the first player to score five goals in a single World Cup finals game in his country's 6–1 group stage win over Cameroon. In the same match, 42-year-old Roger Milla scored the only goal for Cameroon, becoming the oldest player ever to score in a World Cup match. Hristo Stoichkov shared the Golden Boot as the joint top goal scorer in the tournament with Oleg Salenko (six goals), as well as earning the Bronze Ball award. He led Bulgaria to a shock 2–1 win over defending champions Germany in the quarter-finals, before losing 2–1 to Italy and losing the third place play-off to Sweden, 4–0.\nThe 1998 World Cup was held in France, and had an expanded format featuring 32 teams. Iran beat the Maldives in qualification by the widest margin in World Cup history – 17–0. In the finals, the second round match between France and Paraguay witnessed the first golden goal in World Cup history, as Laurent Blanc scored to give the hosts a 1–0 victory. Hosts France won the tournament by beating Brazil 3–0 in the final, with Brazilian star player Ronaldo being controversially capped for the match after having had a seizure hours before kickoff. Debutants Croatia finished a commendable third.\n21st century.\n2000s.\nThe 2002 World Cup was the first to be held in Asia, and was hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan. Togolese Souleymane Mamam became the youngest player ever to take to a World Cup preliminary game field at 13 years, 310 days in Lomé in May 2001. Australia defeated American Samoa 31–0 in a preliminary match – a new record for the margin of victory, and the highest-scoring match ever. The tournament was a successful one for teams traditionally regarded as minnows, with South Korea, Senegal and the United States all reaching the last eight. Brazil beat Germany 2–0 in the final for their fifth title. The Turkish Hakan Sukur made history by scoring the earliest World Cup goal of all time against South Korea at only 11 seconds.\nThe 2006 World Cup was held in Germany. It was the first World Cup for which the previous winner had to qualify; the host nation(s) continue to receive an automatic berth. Four African teams also made their debut in the world cup finals: Togo, Ivory Coast, Angola and Ghana who impressively made it to last 16 by beating the Czech Republic, third ranked in the world, 2–1, along with the United States 2–0, before losing to the defending champions Brazil 0–3.\nFirst seed and holders Brazil and second seeded England were initially English bookmakers' favourites. A strong performance by Germany brought them as far as the semi-finals. However, the final match-up was between Italy and France, in which French captain Zinedine Zidane was sent off in the last ten minutes of extra time for a headbutt to the chest of Italian central defender Marco Materazzi. Italy went on to win 5–3 in a penalty shootout, the score having been 1–1 after 90 minutes and extra time.\n2010s.\nThe 2010 World Cup was held in South Africa. It was the first cup hosted on African soil, and the cup was won by Spain. The tournament was noted for its highly defensive opening matches, controversies surrounding goal-line technology, and the introduction of vuvuzelas. Though considered as one of the tournament favorites, the Spaniards won the cup despite scoring only eight goals in seven games and losing their opening match to Switzerland. David Villa led the squad in scoring with five goals. In a final which saw a record number of yellow cards distributed and what some considered violent play from the Dutch side, the ten-man Netherlands squad were defeated 1–0 in the 116th minute of extra time by an Andrés Iniesta goal.\nThe 2014 World Cup was held in Brazil, marking the second time that Brazil hosted the competition. The cup was won by Germany, who beat Argentina 1–0 in the final. The Netherlands defeated Brazil (who lost to the eventual winners, Germany, 7–1 in the semifinals) 3–0 in the bronze medal game.\nBecause of the relatively high ambient temperatures in Brazil, particularly at the northern venues, cooling breaks for the players were first introduced during these games. In this World Cup there was the debut of sensors to avoid phantom goals with the Goal-line technology, used to determine, in doubtful situations, whether the ball crossed the goal line.\nThe 2018 World Cup was held in Russia. It was the first cup to be held in Eastern Europe. The cup was won by France, who beat Croatia 4–2 in the final. Belgium defeated England 2–0 in the bronze medal game. It was also the first cup to use the video assistant referee (VAR) system.\n2020s.\nThe 2022 World Cup, hosted by Qatar, was the first tournament to not be held in summer time in which it is usually held, and the first to be held in the Middle East. The cup was won by Argentina, who prevailed over defending champions France 4–2 in the penalty shootout, after the final was drawn 3–3 after extra time, despite France's Kylian Mbappé netting a hat-trick, becoming only the second player to do so in a World Cup Final. Previous tournament runners-up Croatia won the bronze medal match, beating Morocco 2–1, whose fourth-place finish was the furthest of any African nation at the World Cup. It is also the last to feature 32 teams, as the next edition is scheduled to expand to 48 teams.\nThe 2026 World Cup is scheduled to be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, making it the first to be hosted by three nations.\n2030s.\nThe hosts for the 2030 will be Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay in South America for the opening matches to honor the centennial of the first FIFA World Cup, as well as Morocco in Africa, and Spain and Portugal in Europe.\nThe 2034 world cup will be hosted by Saudi Arabia, and the host for the 2038 World Cup is yet to be decided.\nEvolution of the format.\nThe number of teams and the format of each final tournament have varied considerably over the years. In most tournaments, the tournament consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.\nIn 1934 and 1938 draws in knockout matches were resolved via a replay. Later, drawing of lots was provided for, though never invoked. Since 1974, penalty shootouts are used.\nIn 1954 each group had two seeded and two unseeded teams; the seeded teams played only unseeded teams and vice versa.\nUp to 1958, ranking ties in groups were to be broken via a playoff; this only happened in 1954 and 1958.\nUntil the 1990 FIFA World Cup, 2 points were conceded for a win and 1 point was conceded for a draw. Since the 1994 FIFA World Cup, 3 points are conceded for a win and 1 point is conceded for a draw.\nEach group of four teams plays a round-robin schedule. As of the 1986 World Cup, all final group games must be held simultaneously, a rule instituted by FIFA to minimize collusion amongst teams requiring a certain result to advance. FIFA instituted a policy to award three points for a win in the 1994 World Cup. Although goals for was already a tiebreaker, FIFA hoped to create an additional incentive for teams to pursue victory. The first team affected by the rule was Paraguay in 1998, which would have won its group on goal differential over Nigeria under prior FIFA rules. Paraguay advanced to the knockout phase as group runner-up and was defeated by host nation and eventual champion France in the round of 16. It is not possible under the new point system to be eliminated from the group stage with a second place or higher winning percentage, however it is possible to finish behind a team with the same winning percentage yet a lower goal difference. This took place in the 2010 World Cup when New Zealand finished with three draws and Slovakia finished with one win, one draw, and one loss. Slovakia advanced in Group F by finishing second with four points, eliminating New Zealand with three points. Under the previous FIFA point allotment system, New Zealand would have advanced with a zero goal difference, while Slovakia would have been eliminated with a goal difference of −1.\nThe criteria for advancement to knockout phase is as follows:\nAs of the 2022 World Cup, lots have only been drawn once in tournament history. However, they were used to separate second and third place in a group (Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands in 1990) where both were already assured of qualification. Thus, a team has never been eliminated based upon drawn lots."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2005–06",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team ended the 2005–06 season by touring Bangladesh in April 2006. The series was seen as an uneventful way to end the season as Australia, who were twenty points clear of second place in the ICC Test Championship, played a Bangladeshi team who had won one Test match in their cricketing history and were ranked at the bottom, over 100 points behind Australia. Bangladesh, however, wanted to refute comments made by the tourists' captain, Ricky Ponting who told London's \"The Daily Telegraph\" in February \"What I would not have is the minnow nations in the World Cup and the Champions Trophy, and I would not have Bangladesh and Zimbabwe playing Tests at present.\" On arrival, Ponting pointed out, in support of the home side, that \"maybe Bangladesh having Test status will take the game forward\". On the back of a three-Test whitewash tour of South Africa, but a 3–2 loss in ODI matches (including the famous fifth ODI, in which Australia scored a world record of 4/434, only for South Africa to chase it down with a world record 9/438), Australia came to Bangladesh to play two Tests and three One-day International matches, without any warm-up touring matches.\nAustralia won the two-Test series 2–0. Australia won a close first Test by three wickets after Bangladesh nearly caused a massive upset; then, Australia comfortably won the second Test by an innings in a match well remembered after Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie, normally a number ten batsman, scored a double century after being sent in as nightwatchman. Australia went on to win the ODI series 3–0.\nTest series.\nFirst Test.\nAfter winning the toss, Habibul Bashar decided to bat and his team initially showed value to Bashar's promise that, despite losing by an innings in both Tests in Australia in 2003, his team would play with conviction. The morning session saw a run rate averaging almost six per over. Opener Javed Omar was caught lbw for 27 by veteran Aussie Jason Gillespie. However, Shahriar Nafees and Bashar then knocked up a partnership that even Shane Warne, who would eventually leave injured with bowling figures of no wickets for 112, could not dismantle - his only chance coming from Adam Gilchrist putting down Bashar for 36 behind the stumps. The pair lasted almost all of the afternoon session, Nafees scoring his first Test century off two consecutive boundaries from Warne, but Brett Lee caught a ball from Stuart MacGill one ball before tea to dismiss the captain. The evening session saw few runs but much wickets as stumps were called at 355 for 5.\nDay two began in similar fashion, Bangladesh losing only one wicket in the morning session as Rajin Saleh hit a half-century, but after lunch the team were out for 427 - their second highest total thus far in Test cricket. MacGill picked up a career best of eight for 108 as the last four wickets fell for just 29 runs. Australia took to the wicket with a disheartened spirit, conveyed by Matthew Hayden being lbw for six runs in the third over and Ricky Ponting was trapped the same way for 21. The rest of the team fell thick and fast if it had not been for Adam Gilchrist putting up a fight of 51* as the day closed on 145–6 with the Australians fighting to avoid the follow on. The third day was resumed with Gilchrist and Brett Lee (12) to bat, the latter being the only wicket to fall in the morning. The eighth wicket, aided by Gillespie helped avoid the follow on, with a partnership of 73 in which Gilchrist managed his first Test century for over a year. Stuart Clark came and went for a duck and Gilchrist was caught, leaving the Australians 269 all out and Bangladesh spin bowler Mohammad Rafique with figures of five for 62.\nBangladesh's scores were worse the second time around, as Nafees failed to live up to his previous innings century after making 33, and opener Omar edged to the wicket keeper Gilchrist for 18. Soon the captain was run out for seven and Aftab Ahmed lost his wicket in the final over to see Bangladesh positioned at 124 for 5 at stumps. The fourth day continued in the same vain as Khaled Mashud was bowled for a duck in the second over of the day and both Shane Warne and Jason Gillespie made up for their first innings oversight by bowling and trapping the last five wickets of Bangladeshi for 88 runs, the former improving his previous 0–112 to this innings' 3–28, despite Mohammad Rafique taking three fours off him. Australia started the final innings in the knowledge that they have only twice, in fifty years, managed to pull off a second innings score higher than the first, needing as they did 307 runs for victory. Taking no risks, Australia's openers made a calm 67 either side of the tea break before captain Ricky Ponting came out with seven boundaries and an unbeaten 72 at the close of play. The second wicket partnership stood for 106 before Australian wickets began to tumble with two removals from left-arm slow bowler Mohammad Rafique to leave the team at 212–4, with only their high-scoring skipper and Adam Gilchrist (6*) in the way of their five bowlers at the lower order.\nThe final morning began poorly for Australia with Mohammad Rafique picking up the wickets of Gilchrist (12) and Warne (5) cheaply to have Australia in trouble at 6-231 still requiring 76 for victory. However, Ponting remained resolute in defence as he uncharacteristically crawled his way towards a century. He was joined by Lee and together they put on 46 for the 7th wicket. But the new ball turned Bangladesh's fortunes and Lee's wicket in the lead up to lunch gave them some hope. Their biggest opportunity came when Ponting skied a pull shot on 98 only to be dropped by Mashrafe Mortaza at fine leg. He proceeded to his 31st test century in the final over before lunch with a cover drive to the fence. Now joined by Gillespie, victory was delayed only by the lunch break. Ponting remained not out on 118. Mohammad Rafique finished with match figures of 9–160. Adam Gilchrist was named man of the match.\nSecond Test.\nDay One started as Bangladesh won the toss and elected to bat. Jason Gillespie took three early wickets to reduce Bangladesh to 3/17 inside eight overs; he would finish with figures of 3/11 from 5 overs. Wickets fell regularly through the rest of the innings, and Bangladesh was dismissed for 197 after the tea break. Rajin Saleh top scored for Bangladesh with 71, and Test Debutant Dan Cullen took his first wicket, claiming the scalp of Mashrafe Mortaza. Ricky Ponting was fined 25% of his match fee for failing to respect an umpire's decision and showing dissent, after third umpire Mahbubur Rahman turned down an appeal for caught.\nThe Australians took to the crease with about 20 overs left in the day. Matthew Hayden was dismissed near stumps, and Jason Gillespie was sent in as nightwatchman. Only 18.4 overs were played on a rain-shortened Day Two, which saw opener Phil Jaques score his maiden Test half-century, before being dismissed for 66. Gillespie and Ricky Ponting were at the crease when play ended, with the score 2/151.\nDay Three continued with Ricky Ponting and Jason Gillespie still at the crease. Ponting cruised to his 34th Test half-century before being run out. Michael Hussey then batted with Jason Gillespie for the rest of the day. During the afternoon session, Gillespie reached a century, which was the first in his Test and First-Class career. It also made him the third nightwatchman to make a Test Century, and the longest innings by a nightwatchman, with his century coming from 296 balls. At tea, Gillespie was 102n.o. and Hussey was 93n.o., and play was called off due to persistent rain.\nDay Four was played with no disruptions from the weather and 100 overs to be played. Michael Hussey made his 4th Test Century in the fifth over of the day's play. Gillespie and Hussey pushed on to bat making great progress through the day with Hussey punishing the pacemen while Gillespie took on the spinners with great drives and a couple of magnificent sixes. Hussey and Gillespie both reached 150, and compiled a fourth wicket partnership of 320 runs, before Hussey was dismissed for 182 from only 203 deliveries before lunch. Then, shortly after the lunch break, Gillespie reached a double century. His 201 not out came from 425 balls, 574 minutes, and was spread across four days of batting. His second hundred was much faster than his first, coming from only 129 balls. His score is the highest ever by a nightwatchman, and the highest score by an Australian against Bangladesh. Ricky Ponting declared after Gillespie's double century, with the score 4/581, a lead of 384 runs.\nAfter Javed Omar was dismissed in the fifth over, Shahriar Nafees and Habibul Bashar put together a 102-run partnership, before Bashar was dismissed by Shane Warne just before drinks in the evening session. Warne took two more wickets in the day's play to reduce Bangladesh to 4/195 at stumps. Warne and Stuart MacGill then took the remaining six wickets inside the morning session on Day Five. Warne finished with 5/113 and MacGill with 4/95, while Nafees top scored for Bangladesh with 79.\nGillespie was named Man of the Match, with his double century and bowling figures 3/11 and 0/14. Gillespie bowled only nine overs in the match, the fewest of any completed match in his career. It was also the final test match of Gillespie's career after being overlooked for the 2006/07 Ashes series in Australia. Having completed his innings, he scored no more runs &amp; took no more wickets for his career tally."

        "title": "Freestyle motocross",
        "text": "Freestyle motocross (also known as FMX) is a variation on the sport of motocross in which motorcycle riders attempt to impress judges with jumps and stunts.\nThe two main types of freestyle events are:\nNotable freestyle motocross events include Red Bull X-Fighters, NIGHT of the JUMPs, the X Games, Gravity Games, Big-X, Moto-X Freestyle National Championship, and Dew Action Sports Tour.\nFreeriding is the original form of freestyle motocross which started in the hills of southern California; due to professional racers such as Jeremy McGrath and Phil Lawrence \"play riding\" in the hills of reche canyon. It has no structure, and is traditionally done on public land. Riders form natural jumps and drop-offs to execute their tricks on. Some freeriders prefer to jump on sand dunes. In many ways, freeriding requires more skill and mental ability. Notable freeriding locations include Ocotillo Wells, Glamis Dunes and Beaumont in California, and Caineville, in Utah.\nEvolution of the backflip.\nThe backflip was once considered all but impossible, the \"holy grail of FMX\". Freestyle riders began contemplating it after the 1998 film \"Children of a Metal God\" showed riders attempting the trick into water. Also it had been done many times on BMX bikes, and FMX riders were using tricks from BMX riders, such as when Travis Pastrana performed an Indian Air, originally from Mat Hoffman, a BMXer.\nIn 1991, Jose Yanez became the first person to backflip a motocross bike. He practiced for it by flipping his motorcycle into the Salt River, just as he had done with his BMX bike. He would kill the engine on his 80cc motorcycle just before he hit the water to prevent damage to the bike. Yanez performed the world's first ramp-to-ramp motocross backflip on an 80cc motorcycle in October 1991 on an 8' tall box jump he built himself in Pagosa Springs, Colorado. Jose's next motocross backflip attempt, this time for The National Enquirer, resulted in a crash that kept Jose off motorcycles and bicycles for two years due to an injured knee.\nIn 1993, Bob Kohl was the second person to perform the backflip on a motocross bike. The bike was a 1993 Honda Cr80. He was a professional BMX rider who had performed the trick regularly on a bicycle. He continued to exhibit the trick until a crash in 1995 left him with serious injuries.\nIn 2000, Carey Hart attempted the first backflip on a full-size motocross bike off a modified dirt landing ramp at the Gravity Games 2000. The landing was less than perfect, and Hart crashed immediately after. But Freestyle Motocross was forever changed. Many people started to attempt it, such as Travis Pastrana, who attempted the backflip off a Step Up jump at Summer X Games Freestyle. He bailed off mid-flight, breaking his foot. The trick was still not attempted on a normal FMX setup, off a ramp-to-dirt setup. Hart attempted the backflip again at Summer X Games in 2001, during the Moto X Best Trick competition, but bailed off the bike in the air, seriously injuring himself.\nIn 2002, Caleb Wyatt was the first person to land a backflip on a large motorcycle, on April 25, 2002, at the Rogue Valley Motocross track (RVMX). This backflip was performed over a mulch pile of grass clippings, leaves, and bark collected during maintenance of the RVMX track. Wyatt constructed a quarter-pipe ramp with the take-off completely vertical shoved into the pile of mulch.\n2002 brought the backflip to X Games glory. Travis Pastrana and Mike Metzger were both capable doing flips off ramps. Kenny Bartram was still learning flips, doing them off the backsides of dirt landings, much like Hart in the 2000 Gravity Games. The unthinkable had become reality; a backflip was now common in freestyle competition. Mike Metzger had achieved a back-to-back backflip, which won him Freestyle Gold at Summer X Games 8. When the Gravity Games came along, riders were doing variations in their backflips, wowing the crowd and the judges, who didn't know how to score the riders.\nIn 2003, regular tricks were being used in backflips such as 'No Footers', 'HeelClickers', and 'One Handed' Backflips.\n2003–2005: These years saw the development of variations including cliffhangers, cordovas etc. As well as the disputed 360s which some consider only off-axis flips. The backflip was perfected over large distances including over . In 2005 at the very first Dew Tour in Louisville, Kentucky, Travis Pastrana landed four backflips in a row. At the Denver Dew Tour in 2006, Kenny Bartram was the first to pull a one-handed takeoff backflip. In 2009 while filming for \"Nitro Circus\", Pastrana completed a backflip as part of a larger crossover jump, flipping over a number of riders below in the process.\n2006 brought footage of Travis Pastrana completing a double backflip on an uphill/sand setup on his popular \"Nitro Circus\" Freestyle Motocross movies. On August 4, 2006, at X Games 12 in Los Angeles, he became the first rider to land a double backflip in competition. Having landed another trick that many had considered impossible, he vowed never to do it again.\n2007 saw Scott Murray perform double backflips onto a large piece of foam placed over the end of a foam pit. Later that year, Murray attempted the double backflip at X Games but crashed upon landing. He landed the trick at a Supercross event in Italy.\nAt the 2008 Summer X games Jim Dechamp tried a front flip and crashed, breaking his back. Three months later during Nitro Circus season 1 on MTV, Dechamp landed the front flip during the Guinness World Record episode.\nIn early 2009, Metal Mulisha rider Jeremy Lusk attempted a Hart Attack Indian Air Backflip. He under-rotated, and crashed, hitting his head on the landing. On February 10, he was pronounced dead due to head and spinal cord injuries.\nAt X Games 17, Jackson Strong nailed the first front flip on a dirt bike during the best trick competition.\nIn early 2015, Nitro Circus rider Josh Sheehan landed the first triple backflip, yet another trick deemed impossible by many, on a custom ramp/dirt setup at Travis Pastrana's \"Pastranaland\" complex in Maryland. he had previously practiced the trick onto a large air cushion at the Maryland complex, using the same custom ramp built for the stunt.\nAt the Nitro World Games in 2016, Greg Duffy landed the first double front flip.\nEquipment.\nRider gear.\nFMX riders typically use much of the same riding gear as MX racers. This includes a helmet, goggles, gloves, boots, jersey, neck brace, chest protector, and MX pants. They may supplement this with elbow and knee pads. Riders may also choose to wear 'body armour' to protect the chest and legs when performing the most dangerous of tricks, as did Travis Pastrana when performing his double backflips.\nMotorcycle modifications.\nRiders use modified motocross bikes with aftermarket parts to lower weight and improve performance. Riders will often shave down the seat foam to give a wider range of motion and better grip on the seat. Steering stabilizers are also common and help keep the front tire running straight when tricks requiring the rider to let go of the handlebars are performed. Many riders will also shorten the width of the handlebars, to make it easier to put the legs on the bars, like such tricks as the 'heelclicker' or 'rodeo'. Excess cables, such as brakes and clutch cables are usually redirected away from the bars, to avoid riders getting their boots caught on the bike. The engine and mechanical details of an FMX bike are fairly stock, not needing the fine-tuning of a racing bike. Riders may also choose to have 'lever' on their handlebars to help then when performing 'Kiss Of Death Backflips.' A 'lever' is usually a metal plate or pipe coming off the handlebars, and going in front of the riders wrist or lower arm to stop the rider from rotating during the flips, but letting the bike continue to move. Bikes have aftermarket performance pipes that give more power. The bike must have very strong suspension and very high-quality tires."

        "text": "This article lists the confirmed national football squads for the 2006 FIFA World Cup tournament held in Germany, between 9 June and 9 July 2006.

        "text": "The USA Rugby Super League, usually known as the Super League, was a national rugby union competition which ran from 1997 to 2012, contested by nine clubs in the United States by its last year. In the 2013 season, it was replaced by the USA Rugby Elite Cup.\nThe Super League competition was sanctioned by USA Rugby, the sport's national governing body, and was the premier level of rugby union in the country until it was reformatted into the Elite Cup.\nCreated by the management of 14 of the best rugby organizations in the United States, the league's goal was to create a high level, national rugby competition in the country. The competition was contested annually starting in 2007, with the largest number of clubs to have competed in the league being 18, in 2007 and 2008. In the 2011 season, the 11 teams competing were divided into two conferences, Red and Blue. The league's 2012 and last season had 9 teams, again divided into Red and Blue conferences. Most of the remaining teams after the final Rugby Super League season in 2012 entered the USA Rugby Elite Cup competition.\nHistory.\nSeasons 1997 to 2000.\nThe Rugby Super League was created at a time when there was a need for expansion of the highest level of competitive rugby in the country. 1997 was subsequently the inaugural season of the competition. There were 14 teams competing, which were divided into two seven-team divisions, the Western-Pacific Conference and the Midwestern-East Conference.\nThe original competing sides in the 1997 season were; Belmont Shore RFC, the Chicago Lions, the Dallas Harlequins, the Denver Barbarians, the Gentlemen of Aspen, the Kansas City Blues, Life, Old Blue, Old Puget Sound Beach RFC, Old Mission Beach Athletic Club RFC, the Potomac Athletic Club RFC, Old Blues Rugby Club (CA), Golden Gate Rugby Club and Washington RFC. Aspen won the first championship, defeating Old Blue 22 points to eight in the final which was played in San Diego.\nThe following season in 1998, two more sides gained entry into the competition, Boston RFC and the Philadelphia Whitemarsh RFC. Both teams joined the eastern conference, which saw the Harlequins move to the Western conference. This expansion saw two fifteen-team conferences.\nSeasons 2001 to 2007.\nIn 2001 the competition became recognized as the premier club rugby union competition in the United States - becoming separated from USA Rugby Division 1. In 2002, the league expanded again, with the inclusion of New York Athletic Club, who gained entry through means of promotion and the Hayward Rugby, who formed a merger with the Old Blues Rugby Club (CA).\nThe 2002 season saw major changes to the competition, with the \"east and west divisions\" format being dissolved to form a national competition. The format reverted to the division-associated fixtures in 2005. Super League celebrated a decade of competition in 2006, with OMBAC defeating Belmont Shore 36 to 33 in the final which was held in Santa Clara, California. It was announced after the 2006 season that the Rugby Super League would be expanding from 15 teams to 18 for the 2007 season. Santa Monica Rugby and the Charlotte Rugby Club accepted invitations to join Super League, as did the Boston Irish Wolfhounds, who also finished runner-up in both Divisions I and III in 2006. The Chicago Griffins also joined to replace the Kansas City Blues, who self-relegated their club to the USA Rugby Division I men's club competition.\n2008 to 2012: Contraction and demise.\nIn the 2008 season ESPN Classic broadcast live the RSL final between NYAC and Belmont Shore. It was a hard-fought match that saw NYAC winning 31–28 in sudden death.\nIn the 2009 season the league shrank, featuring 16 teams in two conferences. Philadelphia Whitemarsh, Washington RFC, and the St. Louis Bombers did not return to the competition, while Life University returned after a six-season absence.\nBecause of the ongoing economic crisis, before the 2010 season longtime RSL powers Belmont Shore decided to only compete in Southern California's Division I competition. In response to this, Santa Monica also decided to self-relegate, dropping the number of teams to 14. Because of the uneven conferences, Dallas was shifted to the Red (West) Conference. In August 2010 the Boston Irish Wolfhounds, and Charlotte RFC also relegated themselves.\nIn the fall of 2011, PAC Rugby withdrew from the competition and the Utah Warriors, based in Salt Lake City, entered the competition. The Chicago Lions and Utah Warriors withdrew prior to the 2012 season. The Chicago Griffins announced their withdrawal following the 2012 season. With the exit of several teams over a number of years, the 2012 season was the last season for the Rugby Super League.\n2013: Relaunch as Elite Cup.\nWith eight teams remaining in two divisions, the RSL was relaunched as the USA Rugby Elite Cup for the 2013 season. The Elite Cup ran for one season before folding at the end of 2013."

        "text": "Wanderers Football Club is a senior rugby union club based in Dublin, Ireland, playing in Division 2B of the All-Ireland League. It is one of the oldest rugby clubs in Ireland, however its exact date of foundation is open to question. In 1860 a team by the name of Wanderers played against Dublin University. However the current team gives its foundation date as 1870. While the link between the two teams is unclear, they both seem to have been founded by former Dublin University players. In 1879 Wanderers were among the founding members of the Irish Rugby Football Union. They have also regularly provided international players for Ireland, including five captains. In 1959, Ronnie Dawson also went on to captain the British and Irish Lions. They have also provided one captain each for both England and Australia.\nSince 1880 Wanderers have shared Lansdowne Road with Lansdowne Football Club, with each club having their own clubhouse at opposite ends of the ground. However, since 1974 the ground itself has been owned by the IRFU.\nNotable players.\nIreland.\nAt least 87 Wanderers players have represented Ireland. These include the following:\nBritish and Irish Lions.\nAs well as representing Ireland, several Wanderers players have also represented the British and Irish Lions. These include:\nVictoria Cross.\nThree former Wanderers players and Ireland internationals have also been awarded the Victoria Cross. Crean and Johnston served with the British Army during the Second Boer War while Harvey served with the Canadian Army during the First World War."

        "text": "The featherweight was one of five boxing weight classes contested on the boxing at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme. Like all other boxing events, it was open only to men. The boxing competitions were held on October 27. The featherweight was the second-lightest class, allowing boxers of up to 126 pounds (57.2 kg). Eight boxers from two nations competed. Each NOC could enter up to 12 boxers. France entered 5 boxers, 3 of whom withdrew; Great Britain entered 8 boxers, 2 of whom withdrew.\nCompetition format.\nThere were three rounds in each bout, with the first two rounds being three minutes long and the last one going four minutes. Two judges scored the match, giving 5 points to the better boxer in each of the first two rounds and 7 to the better boxer in the third round. Marks were given to the other boxer in proportion to how well he did compared to the better. If the judges were not agreed on a winner at the end of the bout, the referee could either choose the winner or order a fourth round.\nResults.\nBracket.\nDid not start: R. Boudin, C. Hamel, and L. Lacombe of France; P.A. Jones and W.F. Norton of Great Britain\nQuarterfinals.\nPoillot gave Gunn strong competition in the first round, but Gunn knocked the Frenchman down shortly before the first bell. When Poillot went down again before the end of the second round, he did not get back up. Morris won relatively easily, hitting with both right and left. Constant, while never giving Ringer a serious chance of defeat, fought well throughout the bout. Roddin and Lloyd boxed a physical campaign, each taking a great deal of punishment before Roddin won by decision.\nSemifinals.\nGunn and Morris both won their bouts in the latter ends of the contests, with Roddin and Ringer giving stiff competition in the early rounds but not able to keep up with the winners the whole way through.\nThere was no bronze medal bout, the third place was attributed.\nFinal.\nGunn fought Morris back and forth, with the 38-year-old veteran coming out on top following a strong final round."

        "text": "International Cricket is a cricket video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was developed by Melbourne based Beam Software and published under their Laser Beam Entertainment publishing arm in 1992. \"Aussie Rules Footy\" shares the same presentation style as this game. Like Aussie Rules Footy, the game was distributed exclusively by Mattel's Australian operation.\nThere were no attempts to release a cricket video game to the North American, Japanese, or European markets. The reason is that baseball games dominated the North American and Japanese markets, while football dominated the European market during that era. Two buttons are used to control the action; one for hitting the cricket ball while the other allows the player to slog around.\nOne of the shortcomings in the game is the simple AI; the average player can bowl the computer out for totals not exceeding 20.\nNaming parodies.\nThe game featured all the major Test cricket–playing nations but no official team and player licensing in place. This meant that player names within the game, particularly for the Australian team, were parodies on the actual names of cricket players at the time. Following is a list of player names from the game and their respective actual names from Test-playing teams.\nVariations of player names for other countries do not appear to be as obvious; however, there is a player in the West Indies team called \"R. Marley\", possibly a reference to Jamaican reggae musician Bob Marley.\nHidden features.\nPlayers can activate a sound test mode that allows them to hear the 24 songs and four sound samples that appear in-game. A hidden squad known as the \"Beam Team\" can be accessed by the player with little effort, requiring the repetitive use of two buttons.\nSequels.\n\"International Cricket\" was followed by an updated sequel for the Super NES, \"Super International Cricket\", in 1994. Beam Software would also develop \"Cricket 96\" and \"Cricket 97\" for EA Sports."

Johnson won a tight bout with Holmes by referee's decision.\nSemifinals.\nGrace took a bye in the semifinals and Spiller's easy win made the round an uneventful one.\nFinal.\nEach boxer went to the mat in the second, but Grace piled on more hits than did Spiller to win the bout."

Doudelle went down the quickest, in the first round, while Dees and Morard were bested in the second rounds of their bouts. The one bout that did go all the way was between Philo and Murdoch, which was such a tight contest that the referee had to break the judges' tie.\nQuarterfinals.\nPhilo, Warnes, and Douglas all had byes in the second round. Baker and Childs had the only quarterfinal match. The Australian hit Childs with a powerful uppercut as well as managing to avoid a charge by Childs that caused the Briton to fall through the ropes. In a clear decision, Baker advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nBoth semifinal contests were knockouts, bringing the middleweight event to a total of 6 knockouts to 2 decisions. Baker defeated Philo quickly, while Douglas took two rounds to put Warnes away.\nFinal.\nIn a match that had the potential to break England's dominance of the boxing championships, Baker and Douglas went through a middleweight final that the Official Report described as the \"best boxing of the day\" (and therefore the entire 1908 Olympic boxing competition). The two fought well, with Douglas's knockdown of Baker in the second a major factor in the Briton's win."

It is organized by and named after the Pakistan Football Federation. Initially named as \"Inter Departmental Championship\", it was introduced in 1979 as a football tournament for departmental selections and armed forces teams excluded from the national football league of Pakistan\".\"\nKhan Research Laboratories have won the most titles (six). WAPDA are the current champions, winning the 2020 edition courtesy of a 1-0 win against SSGC F.C. in the final.\nBackground.\nIntroduced in 1979 to offer nationwide competition to departmental selections and armed forces teams excluded from the national football league then called the \"National Football Championship\", the event was named as \"Inter Departmental Championship\". However, due to internal conflicts within the PFF, the second edition occurred only in 1984 and was rebranded as the \"Inter Provincial Championship\". Although the four provincial teams were allowed to participate, they were not factored into the final ranking in both the 1984 and 1985 tournaments. Only since 1990 has the tournament been held regularly, albeit undergoing frequent name changes.\nAlthough it is an annual competition, it has not been held on a few occasions. The competition was not held from (1980–83, 1986, 1988–89, 1995, 1997, 2004, 2006–07, 2017, 2021–22).\nFinals.\nResults by team.\nSince its establishment, the National Challenge Cup has been won by 15 different teams. Teams shown in \"italics\" are no longer in existence.\nGiant killings.\nThe possibility of unlikely victories in the earlier rounds of the competition, where lower ranked teams beat higher placed opposition in what is known as a \"giant killing\", is much anticipated by the public. Such upsets are considered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition, and the attention gained by giant-killing teams can be as great as that for winners of the cup.\nIn 2009, non-league side Sindh Government Press defeated top-flight National Bank 3–2 in group stages. In 2011, second-division club Ashraf Sugar Mills defeated Pakistan Premier League winners WAPDA F.C. 1–0, and they repeated the feat again in the group stages, defeating National Bank from Pakistan Premier League 2–0, as they finished top of the group. In 2012, second-division side Pakistan Public Work Department defeated Pakistan Air Force 2–0 in group stages. In 2013, Pak Afghan Clearing defeated league winners and defending champions Khan Research Laboratories 2–1."

Smith was also head coach of the Great Britain national American football team. He later spent ten years as owner and general manager of professional American football teams, and two years as owner and general manager of English soccer club Chester City from 1999 to 2001, including a spell as manager during part of his ownership.\nCollegiate career.\nSmith attended Cornell University for two years, where he played football at wide receiver and free safety and baseball at shortstop and second base.\nHe then transferred to Furman University, where he played football, baseball, and ran track, becoming the only Furman athlete for the past 50 years to play and letter in three sports. In football, he started at free safety for two years on two Southern Conference Championship Furman teams, leading all defensive backs with more than 150 tackles in two seasons and being selected to the Academic All-Southern Conference and All-Region teams.\nHe was chosen as the State of South Carolina College Defensive Player of the Week for his outstanding performance in a game versus VMI in 1980, and he was also chosen as the Player of the Week for his performances in games versus both The University of North Carolina in 1980 and The University of Florida in 1981. In the three games combined, Smith totaled 59 tackles, 1 tackle for loss, 3 passes defended, 3 fumbles caused, 1 fumble recovered, and 1 pass interception.\nIn baseball, he started for two seasons in centerfield, hitting .414 in 1982, the 5th highest single season batting average in Furman history, and he was selected first-team All-Southern Conference and MVP. He finished his career with a .363 career batting average, which is still the second-highest career batting average in Furman history, and the highest career Furman average for the past sixty years. He also stole 29 bases out of 31 attempts, giving him the highest career success rate for steals in Furman history for any player who has attempted more than 10 attempts.\nIn track, he ran the 100 meter, 200 meter, and 400 meter, and he also ran the 4x100, 4x200, and 4x400 relays. Smith was nominated for the Southern Conference Athlete of the Year.\nAmerican football.\nProfessional career.\nSmith started his professional American football career in 1982. He was signed as a free agent by the New England Patriots. However, he injured his knee in a pre-season game against the Philadelphia Eagles, an injury that required major reconstructive surgery, and was placed on the injured reserve list. He stayed with the Patriots for two years before eventually having to retire because his injured knee would not pass the team physical at the time. He returned to the football field signing for the Arizona Wranglers in the USFL in 1984, and in professional baseball was invited to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds and signed with the Miami Marlins.\nIn 1988, Smith signed to play and coach for the Manchester Spartans American football team overseas in Great Britain British American Football Association. As a wide receiver and free safety from 1988-1998, Smith set playing records with the Spartans, including setting the then British National League record for pass interceptions in a season with 11 (according to http://www.britballnow.co.uk/), and the British record for pass receptions in a single game with 15 pass receptions for 245 yards on July 7, 1991. His career best receiving yards season was 1988 with 1020 yards. He was named to the All-Europe Team on several occasions as both a wide receiver and free safety.\nCoaching career.\nAfter coaching at U.S. colleges, Smith went to Great Britain after signing with the Manchester Spartans football club in the NFL-sponsored League. Due to his high level of success, which included turning around a 2-10 team before he arrived into an all-time British record 14-0 undefeated team in his first season in 1988, Smith was chosen by the Great Britain National Governing Body as the head coach of the Great Britain national American football team. \nAs the Manchester Spartans head coach, he won three straight Division Championships, three straight Conference Championships, two straight British National Championships, one Budweiser Bowl championship in 1989 at Crystal Palace in London, England, one Coca-Cola Bowl championship in 1990 at Crystal Palace in London, England, one Eurobowl championship with the Manchester Spartans in 1990 in Rimini, Italy, and one European Championship in Hamburg, Germany as the National team head coach with the Great Britain National Team in 1989.\nAs the head coach of the Great Britain national team, Smith and his British national team defeated France 35-6 in the European Quarter-Final in a game played in Birmingham, England, Germany 38-6 in the European Semi-Final in a game played in Hamburg, Germany, and Finland 26-0 in the European Nations Championship Final in Hamburg, Germany. \nAfter leading the Spartans to the Great Britain national championship in order to qualify for the European Football League European Championship competition, Smith led the Spartans to victories over the Dublin Celts from Ireland in a game played in Dublin, Ireland, the Amsterdam Crusaders from the Netherlands in the European Quarter-Final in a game played in Manchester, England, the Berlin Adler from Germany in the European Semi-Final in a game played in Rimini, Italy, and the Legnano Frogs from Italy in the European Championship Final in Rimini, Italy, to win the 1990 Eurobowl Championship. Smith and his Spartans also played in the Schweppes Cool Masters European Final in Hamburg, Germany in 1992.\nWith the Great Britain National Team, Smith led Great Britain to victories over France, Germany, and Finland by a combined score of 99-12 to win the 1989 European Nations Championship.\nPrior to Smith becoming head coach, no British team in history, club team or national team, had ever won a single game in European competition. However, Smith transformed the British game and went a perfect 7 wins and no losses in all European competitions with both of his two teams, the Spartans and the Great Britain national team, winning the first two European Championships in British American football history.\nAs a result of these successes, Smith was nominated by Queen Elizabeth II for national end-of-year awards.\nSmith was the first coach in European history to have won both the Club European Championship and the European Nation’s Championship. He won more than 100 games in total as a head coach, while losing only 15. Due to his coaching success, Smith was selected as the National Coach of the Year three straight times, and as the European Coach of the Year twice. In addition, due to his playing and coaching success, Smith was selected to the Great Britain American Football Hall of Fame in 2004, and to the Minor league football (gridiron) American Football Association (AFA) Hall of Fame in 1995.\nProfessional sports team ownership.\nSmith went on to become the owner of several professional sports teams, including the National Champion and European Champion Manchester Spartans. In July 1999, he bought financially struggling English League club Chester City, making him the first American owner, chairman, and chief executive in the history of European football. He declared his belief that the club could reach Division One (now the EFL Championship) within three years. The club was in administration when he took over, and close to folding with more than £1 million in debt. He was credited with rescuing Chester from the brink of bankruptcy by supporters at the time, and announced an intention to appoint three supporters to the club board of directors, which he did.\nAt the time of Smith's takeover, most veteran players had been sold and the remaining players were mostly young. He kept these young players and tried to develop them in order to keep the player wages low, so that the club could not only balance the budget for that season, but also so they could try to pay off the £1 million of debt that Smith inherited.\nUsing this low budget strategy, along with increasing revenue through good Cup runs in the FA Cup and the Worthington Cup, increased attendance and commercial advertising, and with Smith serving as both manager and general manager for free at no cost to the club, then Smith was able to get all the club's debts paid off within only five months, which was two and a half years earlier than the administration required. As a result, the club was out of debt for the first time in at least many decades. \nIn Smith's four months and 21 league matches in charge of team affairs, Chester managed wins against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Shrewsbury Town and others, but lost 5–1 and 4–1 to Leyton Orient and Carlisle United respectively, and required a replay to overcome non-league minnows Whyteleafe in the FA Cup. However, they did find success in the Worthington Cup, beating First Division Port Vale 6–5 on aggregate; they won 2–1 at the Deva Stadium in a game which saw both Marcus Bent and Martyn Lancaster sent off, and then drew 4–4 in the return leg at Vale Park.\nThey also had success in the FA Cup, as they made it to the third round for just the third time in the club's 100-year history. Drawn against Manchester City, they only lost in the final minutes after the score was tied at 1–1 with eleven minutes left. While scouting Man City ahead of the match, Smith, who came up with a very good strategy and team plan for the Man City match, found that when he could watch a match from up in the stands, then he was able to see the necessary tactical adjustments because of his many years of experience coaching American football, where coaches scout opponents by spending hundreds of hours every season watching game footage of their opponents that is filmed from high in the stands. This skill would benefit the team considerably the following season, when Smith would scout all of Chester's impending Cup opponents.\nHis methods included saying aloud the Lord's Prayer during his pre-match team talk, preparing lengthy written strategic game plans for each match that he went over in his pre-match team talk and gave copies of to each player, always staying positive no matter the current difficulties and circumstances, developing a school program where he went with players to speak with and coach schoolchildren, and to give out free tickets to each child for the upcoming matches, and appointing captains for the defence, midfield and attack.\nIn late December 1999, with Chester out of debt and on firm financial footing for the first time in decades thanks to Smith’s tight monetary policies, Smith chose to step down as manager. His decision came only one match after his team had pulled itself off the bottom of the Division following a 2-1 win over Halifax Town. Smith hired veteran manager Ian Atkins to the dual role of director of football and manager in a bid to avoid relegation, while Smith himself took on the role of goalkeeper coach for the remainder of the season.\nWith the excellent improvements in the club’s financial position, the club was able to sign twelve new players that Atkins wanted and chose, doubling the player wage bill compared with when Smith was manager. The club was also able to afford to pay for team travel by luxury coaches to away matches instead of the regular buses used during Smith's period, and was able to pay for the team to stay at top hotels with excellent pre-match meals for all away matches instead of traveling to matches by bus on match day as had occurred during Smith's time period. The club also paid for a proper training facility with two excellent training pitches for Atkins' team, while Smith's team had endured training on a free piece of unlined grass in the middle of a horse racetrack. However, despite these many financial investments in the team, the team began slowly under Atkins, losing seven of his first nine matches in charge, with only one win and one draw, and falling well adrift at the bottom of the Division table. Atkins' team lost his ninth match in charge by a 7-1 score at home to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, even though Smith's young team had defeated Brighton 3-2 away at Brighton earlier in the season.\nAfterwards, however, results began to improve, and a 5-0 home victory over Mansfield Town in April, where Smith signee Angus Eve, Trinidad &amp; Tobago's career leading goal scorer with 43 national team goals, scored two goals, put Chester in a better position.\nGoing into the final game of the season, Chester had pulled themselves up to 23rd in the 24-team division, and faced a three-way battle with Shrewsbury Town and Carlisle United to avoid the drop to the Conference. With fifteen minutes left in the season, Chester were above both Shrewsbury and Carlisle, but conceded a late goal against Peterborough United that was enough to see them relegated from the Football League on goal difference.\nAtkins left, and fan favourite Graham Barrow returned as manager. He completely rebuilt the team, and in the 2000–01 season, his side managed a respectable ninth place, reached the third round of the FA Cup for the second successive season (in a controversial loss to Blackburn Rovers), made it to the semi-finals of the FA Trophy, and won the Conference League Cup, the first silverware for the club in over 70 years. During the season, Smith served as Barrow's scout and set-piece strategist for all Cup opponents, travelling on his own to scout opponents at least once or twice before Chester played them. In this scouting role, Smith utilized his American football background, where every American Football play is planned and choreographed from a set position in intricate detail, to focus on the development of creative set pieces, both corners and free kicks, for all the Cup matches that were based upon the weaknesses he perceived in the opponents' defensive alignment.\nIn addition, Barrow approached Smith at the start of the season, and asked him to watch the first half of every Chester match from up in the stands as a scout would, and then report what he saw to Barrow at halftime while Barrow was walking from the pitch to the dressing room. This good working relationship between them continued throughout the season.\nIn spite of this success, ahead of the 2001–02 season, Smith appointed Gordon Hill, an ex-Manchester United and ex-England player who was a personal friend, to become the new manager. Chester made a dreadful start to the season under Hill, winning only one of their first twelve matches. Smith finally sold his interest in the club to Stephen Vaughan and left at the start of October 2001, with the club completely out of debt other than what it owed him.\nIn 2003, a British court ordered Chester City to repay £300,000 in unpaid loans to Smith and his family. However, Smith still wanted to help the club, and so he accepted a settlement of far less than half that amount.\nIn 2004, Chester City FC finished first in their division, and was promoted again into the English League Third Division, thereby at that time fully completing the financial and on-field renovation of the club that had begun when Smith first purchased the club in an effort to rescue it from being closed down in 1999.\n\"AppleMagazine.com\" wrote in its April 23, 2021 edition that \"Ted Lasso\" \"was actually inspired by the story of Terry Smith, an American gridiron football coach who took over the English association football team Chester City F.C. and subsequently installed himself as the first-team coach\".\nThe writers and actors of the Ted Lasso series often spoke about Terry Smith before the series began. In this interview and AppleTV+ video, Brendan Hunt, the outstanding co-creator of Ted Lasso, and actor who portrays assistant manager Coach Beard in the Ted Lasso series, discusses a 1999 FourFourTwo soccer magazine article about Terry Smith selling the American dream in a positive way, including a photo in the article of Smith wrapped in an American flag. This 22 year-old magazine article was published in England in September, 1999, when Smith was being the first American to ever manage and coach a professional English soccer team.\nPersonal life.\nSmith became a full-time professor at Lees-McRae College in North Carolina, teaching eight courses every semester in the School of Business and Management. He was promoted to become the Head of both the Sport Management Department and the Health and Fitness Department within the School of Business and Management. He was also promoted to become the Faculty Athletic Representative where he served in the President’s cabinet and reported directly to Dr. Barry Buxton, the outstanding Lees-McRae College President.\nSmith became a Director for Elizabethton High School in Tennessee. Under Smith's leadership, the Bartleby program and Elizabethton High School being selected as one of the 10 XQ Super Schools in the entire United States. Smith then wrote a grant document describing and outlining their program, school courses, and educational methods, a document that resulted in their program and school receiving a $2.3 million grant from the XQ Foundation.\nSmith was invited by the United States Congress, and by U.S. Congressman Phil Roe of Tennessee’s First District, to come to Washington, D.C. for Smith to speak on Capitol Hill to the United States Congress. Smith was one of only four public school educators in the entire United States to be honored with this invitation and achievement.\nSmith created a television show titled ‘The Veteran's Voice’. As the owner of Mountain Television Network, Smith worked with veteran and author Ken Wiley to air interviews with veterans on local television. He also provided DVD copies of these interviews to veterans' family members. A collection of these DVDs are stored at Watauga County Library."

        "title": "Rugby union in the United States",
        "text": "Rugby union in the United States is played at youth, high school, college, amateur, professional, and international levels and governed by USA Rugby. There were over 125,000 players registered with USA Rugby as of 2016. Over 2,500 rugby union clubs exist around the country, including those who are part of college rugby. Professional club competition has existed as Major League Rugby (MLR) since 2017.\nAn international competition, the USA Sevens, is held every February at Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas, draws over 60,000 fans and is broadcast on NBC. The U.S. national team hosts international matches every June, with an attendance of around 20,000. Collegiately, the Collegiate Rugby Championship (CRC) is held every June at Talen Energy Stadium in the Philadelphia suburb of Chester, Pennsylvania, draws around 20,000 fans and is broadcast on NBC.\nOverview.\nRugby union, usually referred to in the U.S. simply as \"rugby\", is played professionally (Major League Rugby), recreationally and in colleges, though it is not governed by the NCAA (see college rugby). An estimated 1.2 million people in the United States play rugby.\nRugby union participation in the U.S. has grown significantly in recent years, growing by 350% between 2004 and 2011. A 2010 survey by the National Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association ranked rugby union as the fastest-growing sport in the U.S.\nRugby union is the fastest growing college sport and sport in general in the United States.\nRugby union was first introduced to the United States in the mid nineteenth century and gained popularity throughout the late nineteenth century. However, it started to decline from the early 1900s after the formation of American football. The U.S. won the gold medal in rugby at the 1920 Olympics and again at the 1924 Olympics, but rugby collapsed in the country after the 1924 Olympics (except in certain hotbeds of rugby such as San Francisco, St. Louis, and New York, which saw continuous competition). Rugby union did not re-emerge in the US until its renaissance in the 1960s and 1970s. The United States of America Rugby Football Union (now known as USA Rugby) was formed in 1975.\nThe United States men's national team, the Eagles, has competed in all but one of the Rugby World Cup tournaments held every four years since 1987. The U.S. national team plays home matches every June, including international test matches. The United States is a Tier 2 rugby nation, which means that it is not currently competitive at the elite level of the sport, but is one of World Rugby's key development markets. The national team has competed in the six-nation Americas Rugby Championship every year since 2016.\nUSA Rugby fields other national teams. The men's national rugby sevens team has been a \"core team\" that has participated in every tournament since 2008 of the annual World Rugby Sevens Series. The women's national team has reached the quarterfinals of every Women's Rugby World Cup, and won the inaugural Women's Rugby World Cup in 1991. The women's national sevens team is one of the core teams in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series, which has included a tournament in the U.S. since its first season in 2012–13. The U.S. tournament was held in Houston in the 2012–13 season, and since then has been held in the Atlanta suburb of Kennesaw, Georgia.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded rugby union match between two North American schools occurred on May 14, 1874, between Harvard University and McGill University teams.\nRugby grew in the early 1900s, spurred in part by American football's crisis of 1905-06 due to the perception that American football was a violent sport. During this era, rugby was perceived as having the potential to challenge American football as the dominant football code on the west coast.\nAt the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, a United States rugby team composed largely of players from Stanford University defeated France to win the gold medal. Rugby union was again included in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, where the United States again defeated France for the gold. Despite this success, however, rugby in the United States largely faded away.\nRugby began its revival in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, as many colleges started club rugby teams. USA Rugby, the body that governs rugby in the U.S., was founded in 1975. On 31 January 1976, the U.S. national team played Australia—in its first official match since the 1924 Olympics—before 8,000 fans at Glover Field in Anaheim, California. Australia won the match 24–12.\nThe United States national team participated in the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup. Rugby in the U.S. received a significant boost in 2009 when the International Olympic Committee voted to reinstate rugby into the Summer Olympics beginning in 2016.\nGoverning bodies.\nRugby union played anywhere is governed by World Rugby, formerly known as the International Rugby Board, which is based in Dublin, Ireland. It is the governing and law-making body for rugby globally. World Rugby has over 100 member unions.\nUSA Rugby is the member union of the United States within World Rugby. USA Rugby is responsible for overseeing rugby union domestically and training the various national teams that they put on the pitch.\nRugby union started to grow in the United States in the 1960s. The United States of America Rugby Football Union formed in 1975, and joined World Rugby (then known as IRFB) in 1987.\nWithin USA Rugby, there are several Geographical Unions (GU's) that are charged with governing a specific region of the country. Within these GU's, there are also Local Area Unions (LAU's), which are responsible for governing a specific region within their respective GU's.\nGrowing participation.\nMore than 98,000 people are registered members of USA Rugby. The numbers of registered rugby members are highest in California, New York and Pennsylvania. On a per-person basis, rugby membership is highest in New England and in the Rocky Mountain states of Colorado and Utah.\nThere are 32,754 men and 11,790 women playing senior-level rugby. Over 34,000 high school athletes (26,212 boys and 8,706 girls) play rugby for their schools or U19 clubs. Over 2,200 pre-teens (1,988 boys and 228 girls) play organized rugby. With over 20,000 registered females in USA Rugby, the U.S. has more female rugby players than any other country in the world.\nThere are 1,582 referees within USA Rugby.\nA 2010 survey by the National Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association ranked rugby as the fastest growing sport in the U.S. \nIn 2014 the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported rugby as the fastest growing team sport in the U.S. during the previous five years. Rugby participation in the U.S. has grown significantly since 2000, growing by 350% between 2004 and 2011. Between 2006 and 2011, the number of high-school rugby players in the U.S. increased by 84%, with 28,000 players in 650 high school programs. By 2010, the number of registered players in the U.S. had grown to over 81,000, moving the U.S. ahead of traditional rugby powers Wales and Scotland in terms of playing numbers, although the \"percentage\" of the U.S. population playing is obviously much lower.\nCollege rugby is the fastest growing college sport in the USA. Rugby union is also the fastest growing sport in the USA.\nIncreasing popularity.\nRugby union's profile in the U.S. has increased as a result of the International Olympic Committee's announcement in 2009 that rugby union would return to the Olympics in 2016. USA Rugby has formally become a member of the US Olympic Committee, allowing rugby players and programs access to Olympic resources.\nAttendance at rugby union matches and tournaments has grown significantly in recent years. Attendance for the USA Sevens tournament has grown steadily from 15,800 in 2004, to 52,000 fans at Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas in 2011. The 2011 College Premier Division national championship match between Cal and BYU drew a crowd of 11,000 at Rio Tinto Stadium. A friendly match between the US and Ireland in 2009 drew 10,000 fans to Buck Shaw Stadium in Santa Clara, and a friendly match between the US and Italy in 2012 drew over 17,000 fans to BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston. This was followed by 20,000-strong crowds at BBVA Compass Stadium vs. Ireland in June 2013 and Scotland in June 2014; these records were smashed in November 2014 however when an historic sell-out crowd of 61,500 watched the match against New Zealand at Soldier Field; the match also drew an average TV audience of 927,000 on NBC.\nAnother significant development in the history of U.S. rugby union came at the 2015 London Sevens, the final tournament of the 2014–15 Sevens Series, when the US won its first-ever championship of a Sevens Series event.\nRugby on TV.\nThe announcement in 2009 that rugby union in its rugby sevens format would by admitted into the 2016 Summer Olympics has meant increased TV exposure. Rugby union came onto NBC's radar following the 2009 announcement. NBC has begun broadcasting several rugby tournaments on network TV, particularly rugby sevens tournaments, considered a television friendly format. NBC has shown the Collegiate Rugby Championship each year since 2010. NBC has also broadcast the USA Sevens tournament each year since 2011. Roughly 5.4 million viewers tuned in to watch the 2011 USA Sevens, helping increase awareness of the sport of rugby. Viewership for the 2012 USA Sevens on NBC earned successful ratings (0.7), beating the ratings for an NHL match (0.4) and five college basketball games (0.1–0.3) played that same weekend. The TV ratings on NBC for the USA Sevens and Collegiate Rugby Championships grew 14% from 2013 to 2014, with the 2014 USA Sevens drawing ratings of 0.7 on Saturday and 1.0 on Sunday.\nNBC, along with its Universal Sports affiliate network, broadcast ten matches of the 2011 Rugby World Cup — three on NBC and seven on Universal — marking the first time the Rugby World Cup was broadcast live on TV in the U.S. NBC broadcast a November 1, 2014 match between the United States and New Zealand, earning a 0.7 rating. NBC and Universal Sports Network broadcast nine matches (two on NBC, seven on Universal) from the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England. NBC Sports Group has broadcast matches from Premiership Rugby since spring 2016, and began broadcasting the European Six Nations Championship in 2018. The 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens held in San Francisco set U.S. rugby viewership records — the finals day coverage averaged 1.4 million viewers.\nIn addition, specialty cable channels have begun broadcasting an increasing amount of rugby. Select international matches and European club matches are shown on WatchESPN.\nBidding to host the Rugby World Cup.\nThe United States has been considered a likely candidate to host a Rugby World Cup, due to the recent growth and future growth potential of rugby in the U.S., which has been recognized by World Rugby. In 2010, Mike Miller, at the time the CEO of what was then known as the IRB, stated that the U.S. would host a Rugby World Cup, stating that \"it's a question of when, not if.\" USA Rugby CEO Nigel Melville revealed in November 2011 that the U.S. had been asked by the IRB to consider preparing a bid to host the Rugby World Cup, and that USA Rugby was considering bidding for the rights to host the 2023 or the 2027 Rugby World Cup. When the U.S. was then awarded the right to host the 2012 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy (a tournament now known as the World Rugby Under 20 Trophy), it was seen as the U.S. moving a step closer to hosting a Rugby World Cup. Nigel Melville stated that hosting the 2012 IRB JWRT was \"the first step to ... hosting a Rugby World Cup.\" IRB Chairman Bernard Lapasset has acknowledged that \"the USA is a very important and exciting market for Rugby.\"\nThe United States has several features that would make it a successful host of the Rugby World Cup:\nOn June 10, 2021, the United States formally accepted their bids for the 2027 or 2031 Rugby World Cup as well as the 2029 Women's Rugby World Cup, with their bid campaigns officially launched on October 20, 2021. The United States became the first country to bid on both Men's and Women's World Cups. On May 12, 2022, the United States was awarded the right to host the 2031 Rugby World Cup and 2033 Rugby World Cup (women's), becoming the first country in the Americas to host the Rugby Men's World Cup.\nRugby and popular culture.\nThe popularity of rugby was given a minor boost when it was featured in the of \"Friends\" in the episode \"The One with all the rugby\", broadcast February 26, 1998. Rugby was also featured prominently in the 2008 movie \"Forever Strong\". Rugby was also featured briefly in the film \"The Departed\", by virtue of being set in Boston's Irish community. Executive and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was a competitive rugby athlete during his college days.\nAt least three U.S. presidents have played the sport:\nNational teams.\nThe United States national rugby union team is nicknamed the Eagles. They played their first international in 1912, but did not begin playing regularly until 1976. The Eagles have qualified for six of the eight Rugby World Cups. The U.S. national team also hosts international matches every June, and generally tours against European teams each November.\nThe United States are currently a Tier-2 rugby nation. The U.S. has been consistently ranked as one of the top 20 teams in the world since the World Rugby Rankings were developed in 2003.\nIn recent years, Houston, TX has hosted U.S. men's national team matches with high attendance levels against countries such as Scotland, Italy and Ireland. In 2018 the U.S. men beat a Tier 1 national team for the first time in a test match when they defeated Scotland 30–29.\nRugby World Cup.\nThe U.S. national team has played in six of the seven Rugby World Cup tournaments held every four years since the inaugural 1987 tournament.\nIn the 1987 Rugby World Cup, the United States won one match, beating Japan 21–18 in the pool stage.\nAt the 1991 Rugby World Cup the United States went 0–3 with losses to New Zealand, England and Italy.\nThe U.S. failed to qualify for the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. At the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales, the U.S. failed to win a match, losing 25–27 to Romania.\nThe U.S. had one of its better performances at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, winning one game 39–26 against Japan, and narrowly losing to Fiji 18–19. U.S. fly-half Mike Hercus scored 51 points in the tournament, ranked seventh highest in the tournament, even though the U.S. did not advance to the knockout rounds.\nThe U.S. came away from the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France without a win. One of the team's high points, though, was the winger Takudzwa Ngwenya, who scored against South Africa by out-pacing Bryan Habana for a try, earning \"Try of the Year\".\nThe USA played in the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. The team's highlights included a 13–6 win against Russia, and a narrow 22–10 loss against tier-one opponent Ireland. The U.S. had a disappointing 2015 Rugby World Cup in England, losing all four matches, including losses to Tier 2 countries Samoa 16–25 and Japan 18–28.\nRegional competitions.\nThe North America 4 was an elite-level IRB-financed tournament that ran from 2006 until 2008. The tournament was contested between four teams, two from the United States and two from Canada.\nThe United States national team participated in the Pacific Nations Cup from 2013 to 2015. The tournament was intended to strengthen the Tier 2 rugby nations by providing competitive test matches in a tournament format. However, the United States and Canada ended their participation after the 2015 competition.\nIn 2009, World Rugby launched a new competition, the Americas Rugby Championship, with four teams. The teams included a \"USA Selects\", effectively the United States \"A\" (second-level) side; a Canadian team; the Argentina Jaguars, an Argentine developmental side; and an Uruguayan team. These matches between A-sides were not considered official international test matches. The competition was held annually from 2009 through 2014, except in the World Cup year of 2011.\nThe Americas Rugby Championship was relaunched in 2016 as a Western Hemisphere equivalent to Europe's Six Nations Championship. The new format involves the Argentina Jaguars and the full national teams of the US, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and Uruguay. All matches in the tournament, including those against Argentina Jaguars, are full international tests, and all count in the World Rugby Rankings except those involving Argentina Jaguars.\nTop-level domestic competitions.\nThe governing body for World Rugby lifted rugby union's ban on professional rugby following the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Since that time, as other nations have professionalized rugby within their countries, USA Rugby has struggled to transition to a sustainable professional rugby club competition.\nAmateur era (1997–2016).\nSuper League (1997–2012).\nThe Rugby Super League was the national premier Division 1 rugby amateur club competition that ran from 1997 to 2012. The Super League was created in 1996 by the major territorial unions within USA Rugby with the intention of creating a competitive national competition. The inaugural season of the competition saw 14 teams divided into two seven-team divisions: the Western-Pacific Conference and the Midwestern-East Conference.\nAspen won the first championship. Belmont Shore was the most successful club, appearing in the finals every year from 2002 to 2008, until the club left the competition. San Francisco Golden Gate then led the league, appearing in the finals every year from 2009 to 2011.\nThe size of the league fluctuated over the years. The inclusion of some sub-par clubs and the exclusion of top-performing clubs was controversial issue since the inception of the Super League, called into question whether it was really USA's \"premier\" competition.\nFollowing the demise of the Super League, USA Rugby formed the Elite Cup in 2013 among the top eight clubs from the previous season's National Division I Club Championship. The competition was divided into two pools of four teams: East, consisting of Boston, Life Running Eagles, New York Athletic Club, and Old Blue of New York; and West, consisting of Denver Barbarians, Glendale Raptors, San Francisco Golden Gate, and Seattle OPSB. However, the competition lasted only one year, as three of the four western members affiliated with the Pacific Rugby Premiership.\nRegional Premierships (2013–2016).\nRegional premierships of Division I clubs took the place of the top-level competition in the United States for several years. While this format lives on, it is not longer declared the top-level competition in the U.S, as 2016 saw the introduction of PRO Rugby.\nIn 2013, seven western clubs announced the formation of the Pacific Rugby Premiership, consisting of three teams from southern California, two from northern California, and two from Colorado. The PRP is a Division 1 competition that began play in spring 2014. The season runs from February to May, with a 12-game regular-season schedule in which teams play each other team twice, culminating in a one-game championship match in May. The teams competing are:\nIn July 2014, five eastern clubs announced the formation of the American Rugby Premiership, consisting of two teams from New York, two from Boston, and one from Atlanta. The competition schedule involves eight matches played in a split season, with the first half of the season during September–October, a winter break, and the remaining half of the season in April–May, culminating in a challenge match between the champions of the Pacific and the Atlantic competitions. In 2016, Mystic River Rugby Club became a full member of the ARP, replacing Life RFC in a reformatted competition. The teams competing are:\nIn 2015 eight Midwestern clubs announced the formation of the Midwest Rugby Premiership, consisting of two teams from Chicago, two from Ohio (Cincinnati and Columbus), and one each from Kansas City, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Davenport, IA. The MRP is a Division 1 competition that began play in fall of 2015. The season runs from September to May, with a 14-game regular-season schedule in which teams play each other twice, a playoff semi final, culminating in a one-game championship match in May. In November 2015, in conjunction with the Red River Premiership the Metropolis RFC, Kansas City RFC, Austin Blacks RFC and Dallas Reds RFC took part in the inaugural USA Rugby sanctioned first round of the Gold Cup. The teams competing are:\nProfessional era (2016–present).\nPRO Rugby (2016).\nThe development of a domestic professional rugby competition is seen as a key step in the growth of rugby in the United States. USA Rugby CEO Nigel Melville predicted in 2012 that professional rugby would come to the United States by 2015. Melville was quoted in 2014 as saying \"We can do it in two years, it will be city-driven and we will start with six [teams] and we will go from there.\" U.S. national team assistant coach Justin Fitzpatrick said in 2015 that by 2016 the U.S. will have resolved to create a professional domestic rugby competition.\nGriffins Rugby, based in Dallas, announced its goal of becoming a professional rugby club. Jake Abbott became the first professional player to join Griffins from English club Worcester Warriors, and by 2015 the club had signed four professional players.\nIn November 2015, the Professional Rugby Organization (PRO Rugby) announced that it was launching a USA Rugby-sanctioned professional competition in 2016. Teams played at medium-size venues, with a 12-match schedule from April to July 2016. The five teams were Denver, Ohio, Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco.\nOn December 21, 2016, the league announced that its investors has pulled funding and that league operations would be suspended indefinitely.\nMajor League Rugby (2018–present).\nMajor League Rugby is a North American professional rugby union competition that played its inaugural season in 2018. MLR is an initiative driven by existing USA Rugby-member teams, in partnership with private investors, who believe that American rugby can thrive at the highest levels: as a commercial enterprise; as an influential player on the international scene; and as a participation sport at the youth and senior level. MLR played the 2018 season with seven teams, expanding to nine teams for the 2019 season. While the 2020 season was cut short due to COVID-19, the 2021 season will consist of thirteen teams: twelve from the United States and one from Canada.\nMajor League Rugby implemented its first collegiate MLR Draft in 2020. Players are eligible for draft after 3 years in college at 21 years old. Free agents can try to join teams at 18 years old.\nClub Sevens Championship.\nThe USA Rugby Club 7s National Championship is the top annual American rugby sevens competition organized by USA Rugby. The best sixteen clubs in the country participate each year. The most successful club in the competition is San Diego based OMBAC, which has won six titles.\nCollege rugby.\nRugby union is played in universities throughout the United States. More than 1,000 colleges have rugby teams. College rugby is the largest section of USA Rugby's membership. For the 2010–11 season, there were over 32,000 college members and 854 college clubs registered with USA Rugby, roughly a 14% increase from 28,000 college members in August 2008. College rugby continues to grow in popularity, and rugby is one of the fastest growing sports across college campuses.\nWomen's college rugby is also experiencing significant growth. Rugby was designated as an “emerging varsity sport” by the NCAA in 2002. Initial growth was slow, with only four women's varsity programs in place as of 2008. The sport received a huge boost with the 2009 decision by the International Olympic Committeeee that rugby would return to the Olympics beginning in 2016. Since 2013, 2-4 colleges each year have added a women's varsity program, bringing the total number of programs up to 21 as of 2017.\nCollege rugby includes the National Collegiate Championship competition in fifteens rugby (since 1980). USA Rugby created a smaller Division 1-A competition in 2011 of roughly 30 schools with the intention of refining topflight collegiate rugby. In 2013 a number of top rugby schools formed the Varsity Cup postseason tournament, leading to the perceived existence of two national championships. The Varsity Cup final has been broadcast live on NBC Sports every spring since 2014.\nThe 2009 announcement that rugby sevens would return to the Olympics in 2016 has led to an increased emphasis in the collegiate ranks on the sevens game, and increasing interest from TV and other media. The highest profile collegiate 7s competition is the Collegiate Rugby Championship (CRC), which is held in June of every year at Talen Energy Stadium in suburban Philadelphia and is televised live by NBC. USA Rugby also operates a college sevens national championship, the USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships.\nOutstanding college rugby players are recognized as All-Americans by USA Rugby. Qualified All-Americans can represent the United States in international tournaments by playing on the United States national under-20 rugby union team.\nHigh school.\nRugby union has been growing in the United States at the high school level, both through high school athletic departments and school-sponsored activity clubs and through independent rugby clubs with no school affiliation:\nRugby became the 35th sport of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) in 2016, following a 2015 MIAA vote that passed by a wide majority. As of 2015, there were 19 boys’ teams and 5 girls’ teams in Massachusetts, with the majority of the Catholic Conference schools fielding rugby teams.\nIn 2017, 668 boys single-school and multi-school teams were active during the 15s season.\nRegional bodies.\nA list of the Geographical Unions (GU's) and their respective Local Area Unions are as follows:"

        "title": "1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens",
        "text": "The 1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens was held at Murrayfield in Edinburgh, Scotland, in April 1993. This tournament was the inaugural Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament. The International Rugby Board invited the established rugby union nations but also were keen to involve emerging nations in the event, recognising the fact that Sevens was providing the bridge between the developed rugby nations and those whose rugby union traditions were less well established.\nThe IRB situated the tournament in the spiritual home nation of rugby sevens, Scotland. The games were played at the home of Scottish rugby, Murrayfield Stadium.\nEngland defeated Australia 21–17 to become the first team to win the Melrose Cup.\nBackground.\nPrior to 1993, Rugby Sevens had already built up a substantial international presence. The relative ease with which the rules could be learnt and applied, combined with the ability to quickly organise teams due to fewer players, as well as providing a fast-paced game for spectators enticed many nations to set up domestic tournaments, and appealed to a large international audience outside of the established power houses of the traditional 15-a-side game. Such was the international popularity of the game that the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) were able to organise a well attended International Tournament in 1973 to celebrate the centenary of the SRU. England came away victorious from that first international event.\nSoon after, in early 1975 the Chairman of the Hong Kong Rugby Football Union, A.D.C. \"Tokkie\" Smith, was talking with tobacco company executive Ian Gow. Gow had been a spectator at the 1973 event and had proposed to Smith to sponsor a Rugby tournament with top teams from throughout the world competing. This gave rise to the inaugural Hong Kong Sevens on 28 March 1976. This tournament grew throughout the 1970s and 1980s in both supporter popularity and the number of participating teams. Sevens was proving to be the bridge between the established international rugby elite and those nations with less resources and less developed professional infrastructures.\nIn the early 1990s, The SRU made a proposal to the International Rugby Football Board for the creation of a Rugby Sevens World Cup. The World Cup for the 15-a-side game had been staged successfully in 1987 and 1991 and had proved the worth of such an event. The IRB, which had a duty to involve and help to develop the rugby of the new member unions, recognised the value of Sevens to further this end, and their chairman, Vernon Pugh, enthusiastically agreed. Thus, the IRB organised the first officially sanctioned Rugby World Cup Sevens to be held at Murrayfield in April 1993. The ultimate prize of the competition was to be called the Melrose Cup, named after the small Scottish town of Melrose where the Sevens format had been born in 1883. A butchers apprentice and Melrose 20-a-side quarterback, Ned Haig, suggested having a rugby tournament as part of a sports day to raise funds at the end of the rugby season and his boss David Sanderson proposed playing in a tournament that required reduced numbers of players in each team. On 28 April 1883, the Melrose seven-a-side tournament began, with the time of each match limited to 15 minutes. The first World Cup was held 12 days shy of the 110th anniversary of that first tournament.\nQualification.\nOf the twenty-four nations involved, nineteen were invited and five had to go through pre-tournament qualification. Four of the qualification places were won by Namibia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Spain who booked their places by reaching the semi-finals of one qualifying event in Sicily. Latvia won their place by beating Russia in the final of a mini-tournament staged in Moscow to decide who would replace the USSR, which had broken up since its invite to the world cup.\nThe invited participants were Argentina, Australia, Canada, England, Fiji, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Romania, Scotland, Tonga, South Africa, South Korea, USA, Wales and Western Samoa.\nFormat.\nThe 24 nations were drawn into four pools of six teams with the top two progressing to the Melrose Cup, the third to the Plate and the fourth-placed teams contesting the Bowl competition. The groups were arranged thus:\nSummary.\nFirst round.\nAs expected, the leading nations all made it through. However, only South Africa, New Zealand and Western Samoa could boast unbeaten records at this stage. Fiji, Australia, Tonga, Ireland and England all lost one match in their respective pools. In Pool A Wales, lost to South Africa but distinguished themselves against the powerhouse of sevens rugby, Fiji, coming back from 21–0 down to lose narrowly 21–17. South Africa managed to overcome Fiji in their pool match. In Pool B Ireland had an excellent first round, beating United States 38–0. They lost to New Zealand, who won the group, but finished second. Korea defeated France 14–0 and the French struggled to beat the Netherlands in an earlier tie. However, the French managed to qualify for the Bowl in fourth place, with the surprise being Korea making the Plate competition in third. In Pool C, the hosts Scotland finished fourth behind Argentina in third (although they ended with the same number of match points as the South Americans and had a better points difference they had lost to the Argentinians). The Scots managed to beat eventual group winners Tonga but lost to Australia and Argentina. Both Tonga and Australia lost one match each, and crucially Tonga beat the decider between the two sides meaning that Australia ended second in that group. In Pool D, eventual tournament winners England progressed well but were beaten by the Samoans but 28–10. Samoa went on to win the pool. Despite heavy defeats to England and Samoa, Spain managed to gain third spot just ahead of Canada.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe quarterfinals were not knockout but took the form of another round robin with the teams split into two groups. Fiji emerged as the only nation with an unbeaten record after overcoming Ireland, Tonga and Western Samoa in the first. The second group was more fiercely contested with each nation claiming at least one victory. Australia and England who progressed to the semifinals despite their respective defeats by New Zealand and Australia. England had assumed they would top their group and avoid Fiji, even with a defeat to Australia in the final pool game. They opted to rest some first team players but expressed dismay in finding themselves placed second in the group behind Australia. The England team had thought that table placings in the event of a tied points tally were decided on tries scored. However, tournament rules stated that the first differentiator was results between the tied teams.\nCup semifinals and finals.\nAlthough England lost to Australia in the quarters, they qualified for the semifinals against the favourites, Fiji. Dave Scully produced what was awarded the \"Moment of the Tournament\" prize with a tackle on Mesake Rasari that turned a certain Fiji try into an England score. England won 21–7. \nIn the other semifinal Ireland were narrowly beaten 21–19 by the Australians, setting up a final between teams that had already met in the quarterfinal pools.\nThe final was contested by England and Australia. Just before half time, England led 21–0 through tries from Andrew Harriman, Lawrence Dallaglio and Tim Rodber, all converted by Nick Beal. Michael Lynagh scored a try before half time, but failed to convert his own try. In the second half Australia hit back strongly and first David Campese and then Semi Taupeaafe scored further tries, the latter also converted by Michael Lynagh. However, time ran out on the Australians and it was England captain \"Prince\" Andrew Harriman who was presented with the Melrose Cup by the Princess Royal. Adedayo Adebayo, a member of that victorious side later recalled how surprising the victory had been to the players involved in it. He said \"We were basically a scratch side. We got together for the first time as a team the week before, played one practice match and went on to win! But there were a lot of quality players in that side and looking back that's why we were able to wing it slightly – the talent came through. Looking back though we had no expectations of winning at the start. We didn't know how far we would go. It just happened.\"\nPlate and Bowl.\nIn the Plate competition, Spain stunned Wales, winning 10–7. Argentina dominated South Korea and came through 24–0. They went on to win the final 19–12 against Spain.\nOf the four teams contesting the Bowl, Scotland and France met in the semi-final. Scotland overcame the lacklustre French side 14–7, and Japan posted 14 points to Canada's nil to reach the final. Japan beat the hosts in the final winning 33–19. Princess Anne awarded the prizes and Scotland received tankards.\nGroup stage.\nSource for the results below: \"www.imgmediaarchive.com\"\nAll times British time (UTC+1)"

        "title": "Brian Wilson (baseball)",
        "text": "Brian Patrick Wilson (born March 16, 1982), nicknamed \"the Beard\" and \"B-Weezy\", is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers. He stands tall and weighs . Wilson is known for his large black beard, which he began growing during the 2010 pennant race. Wilson's entrance at home games accompanied by the song \"Jump Around\" was popular with fans. Wilson also portrayed Peterson, a pitcher in the 2019 film \"Bottom of the 9th\".\nWilson pitched collegiately at Louisiana State University. His college career ended during his junior season, when he injured his elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery. The San Francisco Giants selected him in the 2003 draft. He reached the major leagues in 2006 and had become the Giants' regular closer by the end of 2007. In 2010, he led the Majors with 48 saves which tied the franchise single season record while posting a 1.81 ERA, and he saved clinching games at every level of the playoffs, including the 2010 World Series over the Texas Rangers.\nIn the first week of the 2012 season, Wilson injured his elbow and subsequently underwent his second Tommy John surgery. He completed his recovery midway through the 2013 season and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching effectively with them as a late-inning reliever through the playoffs. However, he was not able to continue his success in 2014, and the Dodgers released him after that season.\nEarly life.\nWilson was born in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his childhood except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, \"I think that's how you need to be raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, and you might not get that chance to say thanks or understand why you did those things. But when you become a man, you understand why.\"\nWhen Wilson was 12 years old, his father was diagnosed with cancer. His father fought the disease for five years before dying while Wilson was attending Londonderry High School; Wilson today says he had to become a man when his father was diagnosed. In a 2011 story, \"ESPN.com\" writer Elizabeth Merrill said about Wilson's high school years, \"He was an honor roll student at Londonderry, but clashed with various authority figures who didn't appreciate his occasional lack of a filter.\" In the same story, a number of Londonderry faculty speculated that some teachers didn't understand Wilson's life situation at the time. Art Psaledas, an assistant principal at the school, added, \"It happened at probably the worst time anybody could lose your dad. Watching his dad deteriorate over the years was probably the singular thing that formed his personality.\"\nBob Napolitano, Wilson's coach at Londonderry High School, noticed Wilson's ability to concentrate on baseball. Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, which happened shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up to see him pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely oblivious to their appearance; he ate and drank in the dugout, warmed up, and pitched a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract straight out of high school, but he did not sign, opting to attend college instead.\nCollege career.\nAfter a coach saw Wilson pitch well at a tournament in California, he was offered a scholarship to Louisiana State University (LSU), where he played for the LSU Tigers baseball team, eventually becoming their No. 2 starter. In his time at LSU, Wilson pitched in 51 games (22 starts) and accumulated 18 wins, 10 losses, and five saves. In 2002, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was in the middle of his third season on March 28, 2003, when he injured his elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery. He also played for the Keene Swamp Bats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, a summer league for collegiate prospects. Despite facing extensive rehabilitation, Wilson chose to enter the 2003 Major League Baseball draft.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nComing off his surgery, Wilson was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 24th round in 2003. He began his career with the Hagerstown Suns of the Class-A South Atlantic League in 2004. In 23 games, he had a 2–5 record, a 5.34 earned run average (ERA), 41 strikeouts, and 22 walks in innings pitched. He made three starts that year, the only time he ever started games professionally. The Giants switched single-A affiliates the next year and Wilson began pitching for the Augusta GreenJackets. In 26 games, he had a 5–1 record, a 0.82 ERA, 30 strikeouts, and seven walks in 33 innings pitched while notching 13 saves, good for second in the league behind Brett Campbell's 19. His performance with Augusta caused Mark Camps of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" to mention him in his \"Minor Report\" on May 15. He also pitched for the Norwich Navigators of the double-A Eastern League (posting no record, eight saves, a 0.57 ERA, 22 strikeouts, five walks, and innings pitched in 15 games) and the Fresno Grizzlies of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (posting a 1–1 record, no saves, a 3.97 ERA, 13 strikeouts, eight walks, and innings pitched in nine games).\nSan Francisco Giants (2006–2012).\n2006 season.\nWilson began 2006 with the Grizzlies before getting called up to the majors on April 23 to replace Tyler Walker, who was designated for assignment after struggling to begin the season. He made his major league debut that day in relief, pitching two innings, surrendering two hits and no runs while striking out three. He later revealed that he hurt himself during his first inning but continued pitching through the second without informing anyone of his injury. Afterward he was placed on the disabled list for a month. On May 23, he returned from the DL. He was optioned to Fresno on June 7 when Tim Worrell was activated from the DL; Giants' manager Felipe Alou said Wilson was not getting enough playing time. Wilson would go on to have three more stints with the Giants in 2006. On July 2, he got his first career save, stranding three inherited runners in the eighth inning and throwing scoreless innings in a 6–2 victory over the San Diego Padres. In 31 games, he had a 2–3 record, a 5.40 ERA, 23 strikeouts, and 21 walks in 30 innings pitched. In 24 games with Fresno, he had a 1–3 record, a 2.89 ERA, 30 strikeouts, and 14 walks in 28 innings pitched.\n2007 season.\nWilson competed for the closer role with Armando Benítez in 2007 spring training. After he struggled and posted a 7.71 ERA, the Giants optioned him to the minors to start the season. After building a 1–2 record, 2.10 ERA, 37 strikeouts, 24 walks, 11 saves, and innings pitched in 31 games with Fresno, Wilson was called up on August 11 when Jonathan Sánchez was demoted. He was initially used as the setup man for closer Brad Hennessey, but he took over as closer on September 11 when Hennessey lost the role due to ineffectiveness. He went on to pitch in 24 games, recording a 1–2 record, a 2.28 ERA, 18 strikeouts, six walks, innings pitched, and six saves.\n2008 season.\nWilson remained the Giants' closer in 2008 and kept the role all season. He recorded 24 consecutive saves from May 3 through August 17, the longest streak by a Giant since Robb Nen had 28 straight in 2000. Wilson was named to the All-Star Game after leading the NL in saves with 25 in the first half of the season. He gave up no hits and struck out one in innings in a 4–3 loss to the American League. He continued to lead the league in saves until José Valverde passed him at the end of August. Despite posting a 4.04 ERA through September 6, Wilson converted 37 of 40 save opportunities. In his final seven games of the year, however, he posted a 9.56 ERA while converting just four out of seven opportunities. In 63 games, he had a 3–2 record, a 4.62 ERA, 67 strikeouts, and 28 walks in innings pitched. He converted 41 saves in 47 attempts; his 41 saves were tied with Brad Lidge's total for second in the league behind Valverde's 44.\n2009 season.\nOn June 5, 2009, Wilson saved Randy Johnson's 300th win. Johnson, searching for his 300th win, gave up one unearned run in six innings in Game 1 of a doubleheader against the Washington Nationals; the Giants had a 2–1 lead in the eighth inning. With runners on first and second for the Nationals and two outs, Wilson was called on to get the save. He walked Ryan Zimmerman to load the bases and bring up Adam Dunn. He then loaded the count against Dunn before throwing a called strike three to end the inning. Wilson then pitched a scoreless ninth, preserving the victory for Johnson. On September 24, with two outs and two strikes in the ninth inning and the Giants leading the Chicago Cubs by a 2–1 score, Wilson gave up a two-run home run to Jeff Baker. The loss hurt the Giants' chances of reaching the playoffs. In 68 games, Wilson had a 5–6 record, a 2.74 ERA, 83 strikeouts, and 27 walks in innings pitched. He blew seven saves, but his 38 saves tied for third in the NL with Ryan Franklin's total behind Heath Bell's 42 and Francisco Cordero's 39. He led the league in saves requiring four outs or more, with eight.\n2010 season.\nIn 2010 spring training, Wilson was asked whether or not he thought himself one of baseball's elite closers. In what would turn out to be a very prophetic quote, he replied:\nOn March 25, Wilson agreed to a contract extension with the Giants. He struck out five batters in innings on May 9 while recording a save in a 6–5 victory over the New York Mets. On May 15, against the Houston Astros with the bases loaded, two outs, and the Giants leading 2–1 in the ninth inning, Wilson struck out Kazuo Matsui in a 15-pitch at bat to end the game. The next day, against Houston with runners on first and second, two outs, and the Giants leading 4–3 in the ninth, Wilson retired Matsui to end the game. On June 12, Wilson entered in the eighth inning with one out, the bases loaded, and the Giants leading the Oakland Athletics 5–4. Wilson struck out Adam Rosales and retired Rajai Davis to end the inning; he then pitched a scoreless ninth to earn the save. He recorded 22 saves in his first 24 chances and was named to the All-Star Game in which he threw a scoreless eighth inning in the contest, a 3–1 victory over the AL. On October 3 (the final day of the regular season), the Giants faced the Padres, whom they led by one game in the NL West. Wilson threw a scoreless inning to earn the save and clinch the division for the Giants. Wilson converted his 48th save that day, tying the Giants' single season save record of 48 held by Rod Beck. He finished the season with a 3–3 record, a 1.81 ERA, 93 strikeouts, 26 walks, and inning pitched in 70 games. He converted 48 of 53 save opportunities and led the majors in saves as well as leading the major leagues in saves of four outs or more (10). He was named the This Year in Baseball Closer of the Year after the season. He finished 13th in NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting.\n2010 postseason.\nWilson made his playoff debut in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Atlanta Braves; he blew a save, but that was partly because of an error by Pablo Sandoval. He earned saves in Games 3 and 4 as the Giants defeated the Braves in four games. In the NL Championship Series, the Giants faced the Philadelphia Phillies. In Game 4, Wilson threw a scoreless inning and earned the win in the 6–5 victory. In Game 6, Wilson entered with one out in the eighth inning, runners on first and second, and the Giants leading 3–2. He got Carlos Ruiz to line into a double play. He then pitched the ninth inning, striking out Ryan Howard with two runners on base, clinching the series for the Giants. He joined Dennis Eckersley, Mitch Williams, and John Wetteland as the only pitchers since 1969 to win or save four games in a postseason series. (In 2014 Greg Holland of Kansas City matched this feat.)\nThe Giants faced the Texas Rangers in the World Series. Wilson appeared in three games, allowing no runs. He recorded the save in the series-clinching Game 5 as the Giants won their first World Series since 1954.\n2011 season.\nWilson strained an oblique muscle in 2011 spring training and opened the season on the DL. He was activated from the DL on April 6. After posting a 3.75 ERA in his first two games, Wilson posted a 1.26 ERA in his next 35 outings. During a game against the Detroit Tigers on July 1, Wilson blew a save for a second straight game and was taken out of the game by Bruce Bochy. Upon entering the dugout, Wilson took out his frustrations by throwing a Gatorade cooler and smashing it with a bat. The Giants still won the game 4–3 as Jeremy Affeldt got the save. Wilson was elected to his third All-Star Game; he earned the save in a 5–1 victory over the AL.\nWilson was placed on the DL on August 21 due to inflammation in his right elbow. At the time of his injury, he was third in the NL in saves, behind Craig Kimbrel and John Axford. On September 18, the Giants reactivated him from the DL. After two games back, Bochy decided to shut down Wilson for the final two games of the season. In 57 games, he had a 6–4 record, a 3.11 ERA, 54 strikeouts, and 31 walks in 55 innings pitched. He converted 36 of his 41 save opportunities, which tied Juan Carlos Oviedo for eighth in the NL.\n2012 season.\nWilson's 2012 season would be short-lived. With the Giants leading the Colorado Rockies 4–1 entering the bottom of the ninth inning on April 12, he made his second appearance of the season to get the save for the Giants. He walked in a run to make it 4–2, but retired Marco Scutaro with the bases loaded to earn the save. He injured his elbow during the game and underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time in his career on April 19, causing him to miss the remainder of the season. During his injury shortened season, Wilson made only 2 appearances with an ERA of 9.00 and 1 save. The Giants went on to win their second World Series in three years. Wilson expressed confidence in an interview on April 15 that he would return to the Giants in 2013. However, because he was coming off an injury and would be owed at least $6.8 million for 2013, he was non-tendered after the season, which made him a free agent for the first time in his career. At the end of the 2012 season, he ranked third all-time in saves as a Giant with 171, behind only Robb Nen (206) and Rod Beck (199).\nLos Angeles Dodgers (2013–2014).\nWilson chose not to sign with any team before the 2013 season because he wanted to be fully recovered from surgery when he attempted his comeback. On July 25, he threw a bullpen session in front of various teams' scouts with the hope to sign with a contender.\nOn July 30, 2013, Wilson agreed to a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the remainder of the 2013 season. After a few weeks at the Dodgers training facility in Arizona, he began a minor league rehab assignment.\nWilson joined the Dodgers' active roster on August 19 and made his debut with the team on August 22 against the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park. He appeared in 18 games for the Dodgers with a 2-1 record and a 0.66 ERA. Regardless of signing for the team late in the season, Wilson made three relief appearances in the postseason without giving up an earned run until the Dodgers lost in the 2013 NLCS to the St. Louis Cardinals.\nOn December 5, 2013, Wilson agreed to a one-year, $10 million contract to return to the Dodgers. The deal also contained a player option for the 2015 season. His numbers were not as good in 2014, as he had a 4.66 ERA in 61 appearances. On October 8, 2014, Wilson announced that he would be exercising his player option for 2015. However, the Dodgers designated him for assignment on December 16, 2014. Wilson was released by the Dodgers on December 19 and became a free agent.\nWilson did not pitch in the major leagues in 2015 or 2016, but announced in early 2017 that he would be attempting a comeback as a knuckleball pitcher.\nScouting report.\nWilson was a power pitcher. He had a repertoire of four pitches. He threw a straight four-seam fastball around 92-95 mph; this was one of his main pitches. He also had a slider, a cut fastball, and a two-seam fastball. His slider traveled around 89 mph. His cut fastball allowed him to use fewer four-seam fastballs. In 2011, he started throwing the two-seam fastball as well. The two-seamer started away on a right-handed hitter (or in to a left-handed hitter) and had dramatic inward (or outward) movement over the plate. He also experimented with curveballs, screwballs, and knuckleballs.\nWilson has said that when pitching, players cannot be worried about the potential outcome. \nPersonal life.\nWilson is noted for his flamboyant personality.\nIn the 2010 MLB All-Star Game, Wilson debuted a pair of bright orange cleats and continued to wear them throughout the season. On July 27, Marlins' manager Edwin Rodríguez complained that the shoes were too bright. Wilson received a $1,000 fine from MLB the next day, and he responded by coloring half of the shoes black with a marker. He said afterwards, \"The fact that he (Rodríguez) thinks these shoes throw 97–100 with cut might be a little far-fetched. I guess we should probably have these checked for performance-enhancing cleats.\" He also stated that he was punished \"for having too much awesome on my feet.\"\nIn addition to his mohawk hairstyle, Wilson has a large black beard, which he began growing and presumably dyeing during the Giants' playoff run in 2010. He never admitted to dyeing it, saying in 2010, \"It's dark because we play a lot of day games. It's tanned. It's focused.\" He decided he would not shave until the Giants' season was over, and only if they failed to win the World Series. During the Giants' playoff run in 2010, Giants' fans began growing their own beards or wearing fake beards. Many fans chanted \"Fear the Beard\", and held up signs bearing the same motto. Teammate Sergio Romo also began growing a beard in 2010; he has had it intermittently ever since.\nWilson has a number of tattoos. On his left shoulder, he has a dragon to honor his father, which represents the \"protection from fear\" that Wilson's dad gave him. Across his chest, he has the words \"In nomine patris\" (\"In the name of the father\"), and on his right wrist he has a Celtic cross with lettering that says \"All Honor To Him\" in Gaelic; both of these tattoos symbolize his Christian faith. Finally, he has Japanese Kanji characters on his arm, which symbolize his faith; they say, \"Father. Son. Eternal Strength.\"\nWilson has enjoyed a great deal of media attention during his career. He once had a locally produced, self-filmed reality show called \"Life of Brian\". He has often been on \"The Cheap Seats\". Following the World Series in 2010, a photo of Wilson celebrating with teammate Buster Posey appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\". Wilson also appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" and \"Lopez Tonight\". He has frequently starred in commercials.\nWilson became a Christian at the age of 23. He has adopted a gesture of crossing his arms, with his left hand in his glove and his right hand underneath pointing with the index finger while looking at the sky, which both honors The Holy Trinity as well as his late father who died of cancer when Wilson was 17. He performs it when he records a save or closes out a game.\nOn May 30, 2011 (Memorial Day), Wilson announced that in memory of his father, an Air Force veteran, he would endow two scholarships for LSU Air Force ROTC cadets. The scholarship will be a need based scholarship available to any college junior or senior. Later that year, on July 7, Wilson gave away 1,000 baseball gloves to members of the Giants Community Fund's Junior Giants baseball program.\nFrequently, Wilson has made references to \"The Machine\", a character from the movie \"8mm\". In an episode of \"The Cheap Seats\", he had someone dressed as \"The Machine\" walk past in the background in full BDSM leather fetish apparel, supposedly unknown to him (but almost certainly teammate Pat Burrell). Another time, in an interview with Rome, Wilson appeared to receive a call from \"The Machine\" and pulled a leather mask (allegedly \"The Machine's\") out of his pocket to show to Rome."

        "title": "Steve Owen (American football)",
        "text": "Stephen Joseph Owen (April 21, 1898 – May 17, 1964) was an American professional football player and coach. He earned a place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame as head coach of the National Football League (NFL)'s New York Giants for 24 seasons, from 1930 to 1953.\nOwen's skill at designing defenses, his fundamentals-centered approach to the game and his innovative \"A formation,\" a variation on the single-wing, also helped his offenses thrive and were key to his success. His personal style was memorable for the odd congruence of gravelly voice and easy disposition to go with his perpetual tobacco chewing.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Cleo Springs in Oklahoma Territory, Owen was raised in an area known as the Cherokee Strip, where his original goal was to become a jockey, a dream denied by his , frame that earned him the nickname \"Stout Steve.\"\nWhile working on a cattle ranch, he attended Phillips University in Enid, where he was an all-around athlete in 1917-18. He supplemented his income at that time as a professional wrestler under the pseudonym \"Jack O'Brien,\" a ruse to preserve his amateur status.\nFootball career.\nOwen served in the U.S. Army training corps in World War I, then returned to coach for a year at Phillips before going to work in oil fields in various parts of the Southwest. He started to play pro football in 1924, at $50 a game, for the NFL's Kansas City Cowboys (who played all their games on the road). After playing for the Cowboys and then the Cleveland Bulldogs in 1925, he was sold to the New York Giants in 1926 for $500, joining his brother Bill. After a futile attempt to get a cut of the purchase price from Kansas City coach Leroy Andrews, he later said of the sale:\nHis leadership became clearly evident during the 1927 season as captain of a team that outscored opponents 197–20, went 11–1–1 and won the NFL title.\nIn 1930, he was promoted to co-player-coach for the final two games of the season with another future Hall of Famer, Benny Friedman. The 2–0 finish was a premonition of Owen's future long-term success as sole head coach starting the following season. In an unusual move for the time, he didn't sign a formal contract with owner Tim Mara. He would coach the next 23 years on a handshake. He retired as a player following the 1931 season, except for a brief comeback in 1933, helping the Giants go 11–3 and get to the title game, the first of eight appearances the Giants would make during his tenure.\nAfter football-playing career.\nThe team slipped to 8–5 in 1934, but still made the NFL championship game again. Facing the 13–0 Chicago Bears, the Giants came in as huge underdogs and trailed 10–3 at halftime. The icy conditions and weather led to an adjustment between halves that became a memorable part of National Football League lore. A friend of the Maras owned a nearby shoe warehouse, and opened it on that freezing Sunday afternoon to supply the entire team with new sneakers for better footing on the frozen turf than they had had with conventional cleats, enabling them to run off 27 unanswered points in the second half for a 30–13 win and the team's first title. More than seven decades later, the contest is still remembered as \"the sneakers game.\"\nDespite the institution of the NFL draft due to the continued dominance of the Bears and Giants, the Giants returned to the championship game in 1935 and won their second and last title under Owen in 1938, 23-17 over the Green Bay Packers despite being outgained in yardage 379–208, with nine points on two blocked punts the margin of victory. New York appeared in four more season-ending NFL title clashes under Owen, but lost them all. An early World War II Three Stooges short referred to them when Moe sarcastically asked a hulking adversary, \"Did you ever play footborl for da Giants?!\"\nIn 1950, the Giants faced a powerful new foe with the arrival of the All-America Football Conference champion Cleveland Browns. The Browns consigned them to runner-up finishes in each of the next three seasons, though Owen's \"umbrella defense\" shut down passing attacks and made life miserable for the first-place Browns. New York won four of their six regular-season meetings but dropped a defensive playoff struggle with them after finishing tied with the Browns for the Eastern Division title at the end of the 1950 season.\nOwen was the host of \"Pro Football Highlights\" on the DuMont Television Network from 1951 to 1953.\nAfter the Giants slipped to 3–8 in 1953, Owen announced his retirement as head coach days before the end of the regular season, ending his 28 years at field level with the Giants. As the final minutes ticked away in his last game as Giant coach, a late-game loss to eventual champion Detroit, television cameras showed him standing alone on the sidelines in tears. His record as head coach was 150–99–17 () and his 150 wins are still the most in franchise history.\nAfter the Giants.\nOwen remained with the Giants as head scout. During the 1954 season, he served as a collegiate spring practice assistant, first at South Carolina and then at Baylor. He returned to the collegiate ranks full-time in 1955 as an assistant coach at Baylor.\nJust weeks after the end of the 1955 season, the Philadelphia Eagles hired Hugh Devore as head coach and added Owen as his assistant soon after. But two seasons of struggling in Philadelphia led to the entire coaching staff's dismissal, and Owen eventually became a head coach yet again, this time on an interim basis with the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts on September 21, 1959.\nThe Argonauts declined Owen's offer to stay on as full-time head coach for 1960, but retained him as a scout and advisor before he moved to the CFL's Calgary Stampeders on August 23, 1960 as interim head coach, but as in Toronto Owen was replaced at the end of the season. On December 29 of the same year, he was named head coach of the Saskatchewan Roughriders, a CFL team that had won just once in 1960. Owen's 1961 team nearly reached the playoffs, then did so the following year and was voted CFL Coach of the Year. But after suffering a heart attack late in 1962, he resigned on January 6, 1963.\nUnable to stay away from the sport, however, he soon came back as head coach of the United Football League's Syracuse Stormers on March 20, 1963. After an 0–12 season, Owen returned to the New York Giants that November to scout for them.\nDeath.\nOwen was stricken with a terminal cerebral hemorrhage in May 1964. After eight days in critical care, Owens died at age 66 on May 17 in Oneida, New York. He was buried at St. Patrick's Cemetery in Oneida.\nOwen was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a member of its fourth class in 1966, enshrined on September 17.\nHead coaching record.\n\"*was an interim coach; co-coached the last two games of the 1930 season alongside Benny Friedman\""

        "title": "David Green (baseball)",
        "text": "David Alejandro Green Casaya (December 4, 1960 – January 25, 2022) was a Nicaraguan professional baseball player who was an outfielder and first baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB). Between 1981 and 1987, he spent parts of six seasons in the MLB. He was a member of the St. Louis Cardinals for five of those years, and he also spent one season with the San Francisco Giants.\nIn January 1995, Green was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in a car crash in suburban Country Club Hills, Mo. \nAccording to the Post-Dispatch, a passenger in the car Green struck, Gladys Yount, 85, of Jennings, Mo., suffered a fractured pelvis in the accident and died of a heart attack two hours later.\nGreen was charged with involuntary manslaughter and served six months in jail, the Post-Dispatch reported.\nEarly life.\nGreen was born in Managua, Nicaragua, on December 4, 1960. He was one of ten children of Edward Green Sinclair and Bertha Casaya. His father was a very successful baseball player in Nicaragua, as an outfielder for the Cinco Estrellas club of Managua and the Nicaragua national baseball team. Green was raised in a primarily Spanish-speaking home in the primarily Creole-speaking city of Bluefields. His sisters, Isabel and Carlota, were noted basketball players. Green is considered to have been born in 1960, although there has been some debate about his age.\nCareer.\nMilwaukee Brewers (1979–1980).\nAn amateur free agent, Green signed a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers on September 24, 1978. He made his professional debut the following year with the Class A Stockton Ports of the California League. He appeared in 136 games for Stockton, batting .262 with 8 home runs and 70 RBI. Green spent the 1980 season with the Class AA Holyoke Millers of the Eastern League. He batted .291 over 129 games, hitting 8 homers and driving in 67 runs. Green's 19 triples were the most in the Eastern League that season.\nSt. Louis Cardinals (1981–1984).\nGreen was part of a major trade between the Brewers and St. Louis Cardinals, who later went on to face each other in the 1982 World Series. On December 12, 1980, the Brewers traded Green, Dave LaPoint, Sixto Lezcano, and Lary Sorensen to the Cardinals in exchange for Rollie Fingers, Ted Simmons and Pete Vuckovich.\nFor the 1981 season, Green was promoted to the Class AAA level as a member of the Springfield Redbirds. In 106 games with Springfield, he tallied a .270 batting average, 10 home runs, and 67 RBI. He was called up by the Cardinals during the September roster expansion that year, and made his MLB debut on September 4, 1981, at the age of 20, entering as a pinch hitter and being held hitless in two plate appearances in a 7–2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Green was the youngest player in the major leagues that year, and batted only .147 during 21 appearances for the Cardinals. He earned his first MLB hit, an RBI single off Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Luis Tiant, on September 26.\nGreen split the 1982 season between St. Louis and the Louisville Redbirds, who had relocated from Springfield. He batted .345 in 46 games with Louisville, while recording a .283 average in 76 appearances with the Cardinals. While facing Pirates pitcher Randy Niemann on August 15, Green hit the first home run of his MLB career. The Cardinals would go on to defeat the Brewers in the World Series that season, with Green batting .200 during the Fall Classic.\nAfter splitting the 1981 and 1982 seasons between the Cardinals and their Class AAA affiliate, Green would not return to the minors until 1987. In 1983, he saw action in a career-high 146 games.

        "text": "William Leon Garrett (April 4, 1929 – August 7, 1974) was a basketball player, coach, educator, and a college administrator who is best known as the first African American to regularly play on a Big Ten Conference varsity basketball team. Prior to becoming a college player for Indiana University (1947–51), the Shelbyville, Indiana, native led his Shelbyville High School basketball team to its first state high school basketball championship in 1947 and he was named Indiana Mr. Basketball. In 1959 Garrett coached Indianapolis's Crispus Attucks High School boys' basketball team to the state high school basketball championship title, making him the only Indiana Mr. Basketball to win a state championship as a player and as a coach.\nThe Boston Celtics chose Garrett in the second round of the 1951 National Basketball Association draft, but he was drafted into the U.S. Army and released from the Celtics without playing in an NBA regular season or playoff game. After completing his military service in 1953, Garrett played exhibition games for the Harlem Globetrotters for less than two years before becoming a basketball coach and educator in Indianapolis. In his later years Garrett served as a coach and athletic director at Crispus Attucks High School, an instructor at Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana, and as assistant dean for student services at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. Garrett was inducted into Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1974.\nEarly life.\nGarrett was born on April 4, 1929, in Shelbyville, Indiana. the oldest of Laura Belle (O'Bannon) and William Leon Garrett Sr.'s three children. Bill Garrett's younger siblings included two sisters, Mildred, Laura, and a brother, James.\nGarrett attended Booker T. Washington Elementary School, a racially-segregated school in Shelbyville, and graduated from Shelbyville High School in 1947. He was one of only a few African American students in his high school graduating class.\nGarrett was one of three black starters who played on his high school's integrated basketball team. In 1947 he led the Shelbyville Golden Bears to its first state high school basketball championship, beating Terre Haute's Garfield High School, 68–58. Garrett also set a new tournament scoring record of 91 points, beating the 85-point record that Anderson High School's Jumping Johnny Wilson had set the previous year.\nGarrett was named Indiana Mr. Basketball for 1947, the same year that Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball. Garrett also led Indiana's high school All-star team to victory over its Kentucky counterparts. At a time when college basketball in the United States was segregated with only a few exceptions, no major college coach recruited Garrett to play basketball. Garrett had planned to attend Tennessee State, a historically black university in Nashville, Tennessee, until others interceded on his behalf to have him enroll and play basketball at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.\nMarriage and family.\nBill Garrett met Betty Guess, a native of Madison, Indiana, and a fellow physical education major at IU, during his sophomore year of college. They were married on August 2, 1952, in Madison, while Garrett was still serving in the military at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.\nBill and Betty Garrett were the parents of four children, which included three daughters, Tina, Judith, and Laurie, and a son, William \"Billy.\" The Garretts' daughters \"became the first African Americans to compete in open swimming competitions in Indianapolis and became nationally ranked swimmers.\" Billy Garrett Jr. is his grandson.\nBetty (Guess) Garrett became an educator and administrator, and died in January 2016. Her second husband was Herbert Inskeep.\nCareer.\nBetween 1947, when he began college, until his death in 1974, Garrett played and coached basketball, and served as an educator and school administrator.\nCollege basketball.\nGarrett began playing for head coach Branch McCracken at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1947.\nGarrett was the first African American to play on the IU basketball team and also the first to regularly start on a Big Ten Conference team. In 1944 Richard \"Dick\" Culbertson became the first African American to play in the Big Ten; however, he was a substitute player instead of a regular player on the University of Iowa team. Also, the conference was called the Big Nine between 1946, when the University of Chicago withdrew from the league, until 1950, when Michigan State joined it.\nEven though the states in which the Big Ten Conference teams were located had talented African American high school basketball players, Big Ten coaches did not recruit them. In addition, the Big Ten teams remained segregated into the late 1940s because all of the Big Ten coaches adhered to an unwritten \"gentlemen's agreement\" that barred black players from their teams. Basketball was not the only activity that remained segregated in the late 1940s. Hospitals, schools, restaurants, theaters, neighborhoods, pools, and recreation centers, among others, were segregated \"by law or by custom\" as well. IU also barred black students from living in most residence halls, eating in campus dining rooms, participating in university social events, and joining honorary societies and white fraternity and sororities. However, by the late 1940s African Americans began \"pressing for more substantial change.\"\nIn August 1947 civil rights activist Faburn DeFrantz, executive director of Indianapolis's Senate Avenue Young Men's Christian Association, and a few others, met with IU president Herman B Wells, who had made integration of the IU Bloomington campus among his top priorities. DeFrantz and his associates lobbied Wells on Garrett's behalf to give him a chance to play basketball at IU. Wells conferred with McCracken, who made the decision to let Garrett try out for the team and agreed to let Garrett play if he qualified.\nGarrett was admitted to IU in the fall of 1947, the same year that Jackie Robinson integrated professional baseball, and began practice on November 1, 1947, as a member of IU's freshman team (first-year IU students were not allowed to play on the varsity squad at that time). Garrett, who played the center position, made his debut on the varsity team in December 1948 when IU beat DePauw University 61–48, and he became the first African American player on IU's varsity basketball team. During his first season on the varsity team Garrett scored 220 points, the highest total for an individual on the team that season. Garrett played his final collegiate basketball game on March 5, 1951. During his final year at IU the team's overall record was 19–3 and ranked seventh in the country.\nDuring his career at IU, Garrett broke the school's four-year career scoring record with a total of 792 points. Garrett also broke the record during the 1950–51 season for scoring the highest number of points in Big Ten Conference games with a total of 193. In June 1951, a month after the Boston Celtics selected Garrett as a player in the second round of the National Basketball Association draft, he graduated from IU with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education.\nGarrett was the sole African American basketball player in the Big Ten Conference during all four years he played for IU. Pressure to perform well on the court was \"intense.\" He also \"endured taunts form opponents and their fans\" and had to overcome \"early hostility from some of his own teammates,\" as well as several incidents of racial discrimination at home and when the team was on the road. Despite the many challenges and obstacles, Garrett emerged as favorite among the IU fans in addition to setting new scoring and rebounding records for the school. In his senior season (1950–51) Garrett's IU teammates voted him most valuable player. Big Ten coaches and numerous sportswriters also acknowledged his talent, voting him to the All Big Ten first team. Garrett was named a consensus All-American in 1951, and coaches elected him as a write-in for the college all-star team after his name was left off the ballot.\nProfessional basketball and military service.\nOn May 5, 1951, the Boston Celtics chose Garrett in the second round of the NBA draft, making him the third black player ever selected for the NBA. However, Garrett's professional basketball career was quickly curtailed after he drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War and instructed to report for induction by September 7, 1951.\nGarrett was honorably discharged on August 8, 1953, after two year of military service, mostly in Japan, and returned home to the United States. Garrett intended to play professional basketball, but he learned that the Celtics had released him from the team. \"At that time NBA teams had quotas for African American players, and the Celtics already had two on their roster.\" The team's leadership may also have been concerned that Garrett's height (six foot, three inches) was not tall enough to play center and uncertain about his ability to switch to playing a guard or forward position.\nAfter Garrett's release from the Celtics, the Harlem Globetrotters founder and owner, Abe Saperstein, who had scouted Garrett since his playing days at IU, offered him a contract to play for the team. Garrett considered the team's comic acts and jokes more show-business entertainment rather than a competitive basketball game. He stayed with the Globetrotters for less than two years before leaving the organization in 1955. At the conclusion his playing career, Garrett took a job as a factory worker in Toledo, Ohio, where his wife found work as a teacher, until he took a job as a high school basketball coach and teacher in Indiana.\nHigh school basketball coach.\nFollowing his nearly two-year stint with the Globetrotters, and several months of factory work in Ohio, Garrett began teaching and coaching basketball at Wood High School in Indianapolis, Indiana, in September 1956, but his stay was only a brief one. In 1957 \nGarrett was hired to replace Ray Crowe as head coach of Indianapolis's Crispus Attucks High boys' basketball team. Crowe had coached the all-black high school team to back-to-back state championships in 1955 and 1956, led by Oscar Robertson. Two years later, Garrett coached the Crispus Attucks Tigers to another state high school basketball championship title in 1959, beating Kokomo High School in the title game, 92–54. The victory made Garrett the only Indiana Mr. Basketball to win a state championship as a player and as a coach. The Indiana Sportswriters and Broadcasters Association also named Garrett the Coach of the Year.\nGarrett remained coach of the Crispus Attucks boys' basketball team for ten years, stepping down from the post in 1968, the same year he earned a master's degree in education and a guidance certificate from Butler University. Garrett was named the school's athletic director in 1969, and remained at Attucks for two more years.\nLater years.\nIn 1971 Garrett became director of continuing education at Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana, but left the position two years later to begin work as assistant dean for student services at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis in 1973, a year before his untimely death.\nDeath and legacy.\nIn August 1974 Garrett suffered a sudden heart attack and died four days later on August 7, 1974, at the age of forty-five. He is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.\nAs a college basketball player for IU, Garrett was the first African American to regularly play on a Big Ten Conference team. In addition, Garrett's play as a starter on the IU varsity team is credited for breaking the unwritten agreement among Big Ten coaches that barred African Americans from playing on its conference teams. Garrett's actions on and off the court set an example and paved the way for other black players in the Big Ten to follow.\nDuring Garrett's years at IU (1947–1951), he was the only African American playing on a Big Ten varsity basketball team (1948–51). The University of Michigan's John Codwell and Michigan State's Rickey Ayala were freshmen players during Garrett's senior year (1950–51). In the season following Garrett's graduation from IU in 1951 \"at least seven black ballplayers made Big Ten teams,\" including Ernie Hall at Purdue University and Bob Jewell at Michigan. By 1952 others had joined the rosters of Big Ten varsity teams: Rickey Ayala at Michigan State, Walt Moore at the University of Illinois, and Deacon Davis at Iowa, following the path that Garrett had forged earlier at IU."

        "title": "Jack Gibson (rugby league)",
        "text": "Jack Gibson OAM (27 February 1929 – 9 May 2008) was an Australian rugby league coach, player, and commentator. He is widely considered one of the greatest coaches in the sport's history. Nicknamed 'Supercoach', he was highly regarded not only for his coaching record but also for his thirst for innovation, as he introduced new coaching and training methods into the sport in the 1970s, and 1980s, when first-grade rugby league was then still played and coached on a semi-professional basis.\nHe played and coached in Sydney's top grade competition, the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership, and coached Eastern Suburbs to premierships in 1974 and 1975 and later the Parramatta Eels to three successive premierships from 1981 to 1983.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Kiama, New South Wales of Irish descent, Gibson's family relocated to Sydney in his youth. He played third-grade rugby league at St. George in 1950 before joining a social side in the Eastern Suburbs A-grade competition called Taylor's Celebrity Club. Gibson worked as a bouncer for Joe Taylor at the sly drinking and gambling outlet Thommo's Two-Up School, as well as other Sydney nightclubs that Taylor owned. Gibson also fought as an amateur for the NSW boxing title.\nPlaying career.\nRoosters.\nGibson was graded with Eastern Suburbs in 1953. He debuted in first grade and represented for New South Wales that same year. In 1954 he also represented for Sydney but spent the second half of the season in the country at Grenfell, New South Wales following some work troubles. He returned to St. George Dragons in 1957, and played in the third grade grand final.\nReturning to Easts in 1955 Gibson went on to play 152 first grade games for the club primarily at prop or second-row. He made a further Sydney representative appearance in 1958 and captained the Roosters in the 1960 Grand final loss to St. George. He left Easts at the end of 1961.\nNewtown &amp; Wests.\nGibson spent the 1962 season with Newtown and was set for retirement until the club put him on open contract at the end of 1962. He was snapped up by Wests, playing out his career in the 1963 and 1964 seasons, including their 1963 Grand final loss.\nWests 1963 Grand Final loss to St George was controversial thanks to some perceived biased refereeing by Darcy Lawler. Prior to the game, one Wests player (later named to be Gibson by team captain Arthur Summons) entered the change room at the Sydney Cricket Ground and promptly told his teammates that if they had backed themselves to win they had better lay off their bets because he had been informed by his own SP Bookie that \"The ref has backed St George\". During the game, played on an extremely muddy ground thanks to heavy rain and lower grade games that had churned up the cricket pitch area, Lawler had made some questionable decisions against Wests. Just before half time, Wests had a try disallowed. With St George leading 5–3, centre Gil MacDougall had a chance to give Wests the lead when he won a race to the ball and looked to have grounded it for a try, but Lawler ruled that he did not ground it. Later with 15 minutes to go and the score still favouring Saints 5–3, St George winger Johnny King scored a controversial match winning try with Wests players claiming that King had been tackled and that they believed Lawler had called him to play the ball, only for King to get up and continue his run to the try line with Lawler then awarding the try giving St George an 8–3 win and their third straight Grand Final win over Wests. Both decisions fuelled the debate about Lawler's impartiality on the day. Lawler, who awarded St George the penalties 18–7, retired after the match.\nCricketer.\nGibson also played first-grade cricket for the Waverley club in Sydney, taking 92 wickets as a fast bowler.\nCoaching.\nEarly coaching years.\nJack Gibson began his first-grade NSWRL coaching career at Eastern Suburbs in 1967. In 1966 the club had not won a match, but Gibson took them to the semi-finals that first year. Gibson's tactics of having a mobile, hard-working forward pack combined with a fast-moving defensive line that stifled their opposition saw Easts build the best defensive record in the competition. In 1968 the team finished with a defensive record second only to eventual premiers South Sydney and again made the semi-finals, then were knocked out in week one by St. George.\nGibson then left Easts to join St George, taking all three grades at the club to the 1971 Grand Final. On leaving the Dragons he linked up with Newtown where he enjoyed immediate success, taking out the Wills Cup pre-season tournament, helping the foundation club to its only club championship and a berth in the preliminary final where they were knocked out by Cronulla. Tellingly, the following year after Gibson had left, the Jets slipped back and finished the season in 7th place.\nRoosters premierships.\nIn the 1973 the high-rolling Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club at Bondi Junction announced a phenomenal $600,000 profit. The club set about to regain premiership honours that they hadn't seen since 1945 and bought Souths Test hooker Elwyn Walters to add to their experienced forwards in Arthur Beetson and Ron Coote and made a headline-grabbing buy in rugby union international Russell Fairfax to add to their already strong and fast backline. Securing former club-captain and coach Gibson put all the pieces in place.\n1974.\nEasts dominated the 1974 season winning 19 of 22 matches to finish eight points ahead of their nearest rivals. When they were surprisingly beaten by Canterbury in the major semi-final, Gibson launched a scathing attack on referee Keith Page claiming \"if Page has the final I may as well not send a team out.\" Over the next ten years, Gibson would turn the highly popular coaching technique of blaming the referee for his side's losses into an art form.\nOn Grand Final day Eastern Suburbs thumped Canterbury 19-4, giving Gibson his first premiership as a coach and the Roosters their first in 29 years.\n1975.\nIn season 1975 after losing consecutive matches in rounds 2 and 3, the Roosters juggernaut rolled on and they posted 19 consecutive wins to close out the regular season; a streak that ran from round 4 to round 22 and remains the equal record for the most consecutive wins in premiership history with the 2021 Melbourne Storm team. The Roosters dominated St. George on Grand Final day with a punishing seven try haul in the second half and an emphatic 38–0 victory. In addition to the back-to-back premiership titles, Gibson also steered the club that season to victory in the mid-week Amco Cup and to a rightful claim as the best club team in the world in defeating English champions, St Helens R.F.C. in the inaugural World Club Challenge.\nBy 1976 a number of other clubs, notably Parramatta and Manly had caught up with the high standards that Gibson had fostered at Easts; the club's dominance ended and he moved to South Sydney. Gibson endured the leanest spell of his career there, failing to get as far as the semi-finals in his two seasons with the club of 1978 and 1979.\nParramatta premierships.\nGibson then linked with Parramatta leading them to the most successful era in their history taking out three consecutive premierships from 1981 to 1983.\n1981.\nIn club Chief-Executive Denis Fitzgerald Gibson found an ally in his remorseless approach to sledging referees and applying pressure via the media. On 5 April 1981, Gibson dared the Referees Appointments Board to give Greg Hartley another Eels match after they lost 12–8 to Canterbury. The following week Gibson sent a personal letter to Kevin Roberts complimenting him for his handling of the Parramatta-Souths match which the Eels won 39–5. Come finals time, Gibson continued to apply pressure when he publicly criticised the appointment of Hartley to control the Eels major semi-final clash with Eastern Suburbs. The tactic may have proved effective – Parramatta beat Easts 12–8 when Hartley awarded Parramatta two vital penalties in extra time which Mick Cronin converted. But nonetheless the better team still won on the day\nOn Grand final day 1981 Parramatta found themselves up against rank outsiders Newtown playing in their first premiership decider in 26 years. Parramatta were still looking for their first title ever and their old hands in Edge, Price, Hilditch and O'Reilly along with the explosive young backline of Kenny, Cronin, Sterling, Grothe and Ella all masterfully mentored by Gibson took the premiership glory. Later back at the packed Parramatta Leagues Club auditorium, Gibson had just six words for the club faithful: \"Ding, dong, the witch is dead,\" he said before the thunderous chants of the success-starved blue and gold army of fans who in their zeal later that night burned the old Cumberland Oval grandstand to the ground. After the win a more gracious Parramatta management submitted an official apology to the NSWRFL over the Gibson-Hartley feud.\n1982.\nUnder Gibson the nucleus of that side was kept together and the Eels went on to win the competition in the next two years – season 1982 and season 1983.\nManly were comfortable pre-match favourites for the 1982 Grand Final having demolished Parramatta three times that season including a 20–0 drubbing in a spiteful major semi-final. Gibson, Fitzgerald and lock-forward Ray Price again employed the tactic of publicly criticising referees and in the week leading up the match John Gocher was the target of the pressure. When the Sea-Eagles scored first in the second minute it looked like the game was playing to expectations but things changed from there. Parramatta's forward pack began to dominate Manly's all international six and before half-time Brett Kenny crossed for two tries and set-up another three for Sterling, Ella and Neil Hunt to ensure a second title for the Eels.\nThat Parramatta could come back from the semi-final loss and defeat Easts 33–0 in the Preliminary Final was testament to the skill of Gibson and the quality of the side. That they did the same to Manly the following week in the Grand Final is further evidence of the enormous self-belief that Gibson was able to generate in the team.\n1983.\nClaims that the week's rest for winning the major semi-final could work against a side surfaced again when Parramatta dismissed Manly 18–6 in the 1983 Grand Final. The Sea-Eagles trailed 12–0 after 29 minutes and didn't score a point until the 45th minute. The champion Eels and their coach Gibson were indisputedly at the top of the football tree.\nThe 1983 title took Gibson's personal Grand Final win tally to five, then sharing with Ken Kearney jointly the title of the most successful coach in Australian premiership history. It would be over twenty years before Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett, himself a great admirer of Gibson, beat that record with the Broncos' premiership win in National Rugby League season 2006.\nCronulla-Sutherland.\nGibson's last club coaching role was with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks from 1985 to 1987. He had few big-name players to work with but did an admirable job in developing a pool of local junior talent and the club eventually made the semi-finals in the two immediate years following his departure.\nState of Origin.\nGibson was given the New South Wales Blues to coach in the 1989 State of Origin series. The team had previously lost five successive games and Gibson was brought in along with a number of sweeping player changes. However the new squad did no better and Gibson had to suffer the ignominy of a 3–0 whitewash to a Maroons side coached by his friend and protégé Arthur Beetson. The following year in 1990 he had his revenge when his New South Wales side trumped Beetson's Queenslanders 2–1. Gibson quit while on top to take up a role back at the Roosters in 1991 as manager with former Test halfback Mark Murray as coach. He did this until 1994.\nCoaching influences.\nGibson studied coaching and training methods in other sports looking for innovations which could be incorporated into his rugby league coaching. In particular, he would often travel to the US to watch NFL teams play and train. Gibson was a fan of legendary Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi and was influenced by Lombardi's coaching and management style.\nThe Cadigan reference reports that rugby league identity Terry Fearnley first introduced Gibson to the sayings and attitudes of Vince Lombardi via a 1971 sales and motivational film called The Second Effort which contained a Lombardi segment. Gibson's charges at St George had at that stage of the 1971 season won only four of their first eight games. After embracing the film and its messages and showing it to the entire St George playing roster, all three Dragons sides were unbeaten for the next seven weeks; lost just two of the remaining 14 matches; and all three grades of the club made it to their respective Grand finals that year.\nHe befriended San Francisco 49ers coach Dick Nolan at an NFL annual conference in 1972 and was invited to study and observe the operations of the 49ers team. From these trips came a number of methodologies that changed the Australian game.\nLaconic wit.\nGibson was also known for his notable and laconic quotes. Players, coaches and journalists in Australia would hang on every word he said and many of Gibson's quotes showed his great wisdom on the sport. His sardonic one-liners were embraced by Australian press looking to colour their sports pages and many of his quotes are still referred to within rugby league circles.\nAccolades.\nGibson's esteem in Australian rugby league remained strong throughout his life. Up until he was incapacitated, past players, coaches and journalists still telephoned him for advice or a quote, even though he hadn't been actively involved in game for some time.\nIn 1988 Gibson was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia \"for service to rugby league as a coach\". In 2000 he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being a five-time premiership winning coach.\nOn 17 April 2008, Gibson was selected as Coach of Australian rugby league's \"Team of the Century\". Part of the code's centenary year celebrations in Australia, the elite team is the panel's majority choice for those considered to be the best of all time.\nThe Jack Gibson Cup has been contested each season since 2008 by the Sydney Roosters and Parramatta Eels clubs, whom Gibson coached to consecutive premierships in 1974–75 and 1981–83 respectively. The Roosters have won all but one of the matches played for the Jack Gibson Cup.\nPersonal tragedy.\nIn 1988 Gibson's eldest son Luke aged 25, who had struggled with schizophrenia, died of a heroin overdose. Gibson and his wife Judy became fervent in their support of charities assisting research into schizophrenia and he donated the proceeds of four books he co-wrote with Ian Heads to that cause.\nIllness and death.\nGibson was confined to a Sydney nursing home for two years before his death and required around-the-clock care as his condition deteriorated.\nGibson died at 6.32pm (AEST) on 9 May 2008, 90 minutes before rugby league's historic Centenary Test Match, after a two-year battle with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. His death was announced during the Centenary test by Peter Sterling on the Nine Network.\nAt all rugby league matches that weekend a minute's silence was held for him.\nFurther reading.\n \n \n \n "

        "text": "Oscar Joshua Boone (born November 21, 1984) is an American former professional basketball player. A 6'10\" power forward-center, he played three years of college basketball for UConn. He declared for the 2006 NBA draft after his junior season, forgoing his final year of college.\nHigh school.\nBorn in Mount Airy, Maryland, he attended South Carroll High School in Sykesville, Maryland, where he averaged 20 points, 14.4 rebounds and seven blocked shots per game. He teamed with Indiana-bound Marshall Strickland to lead South Carroll to a 20–6 record. In his junior year, the team tied Governor Thomas Johnson High School for the league championship. South Carroll then lost in the regional semi-finals to top-ranked Paint Branch High School. The next year, he helped lead the team to only the school's second ever state final four appearance, losing to Gwynn Park in the final four. After graduating, he attended West Nottingham Academy (a small college prep school) in Colora, Maryland, averaging 28 points, 16 rebounds and 9.7 blocks per game.\nCollege.\nFreshman.\nBoone played college basketball for UConn and was named to the Big East All-Rookie Team. Started 37 of 38 games at power forward. Averaged 5.9 points, 5.8 rebounds and 1.7 blocks, and shot .554 from the field, for NCAA Champion Huskies. Scored nine points in both Final Four games, and grabbed 14 rebounds in National Semifinal win over Duke. Averaged 8.0 points and 11.3 rebounds in three Big East Tournament games. Set a Big East Tourney record for rebounds in a game by a freshman with a career-high 16 boards in quarterfinal win at Notre Dame. In the Huskies season opener vs. Yale, became the 12th freshman under Jim Calhoun to start the season opener.\nSophomore.\nBig East Defensive Player of the Year and All-Big East Second Team selection.

Recorded 17 points and 15 rebounds in a 66–53 win at South Florida on March 1, 2006.\nProfessional career.\nNBA.\nBoone was picked 23rd overall in the 2006 NBA draft by the New Jersey Nets. He was picked right behind former UConn teammate, Marcus Williams who was also selected by the Nets. During the 2006 Pepsi Pro Summer League in Orlando he led the league in rebounding (9 rpg) and was 2nd in blocked shots (1.67 bpg).\nAfter the summer league he underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder and was expected to be out for 4–6 months, however he returned much earlier. Boone made his NBA debut December 2, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, playing 2 minutes. Suffering the effects of the injury and missing the pre-season training, Boone had an inconsistent but promising rookie season.\nBoone averaged 4.2 points per game, 2.80 rebounds per game and 0.3 blocks per game during his rookie season. On December 26, 2006, he had a season-high of 12 rebounds against the Detroit Pistons, a game in which he played 30 minutes, the most he had played hitherto. Boone had a then career-high 21 points on 10-for-10 shooting, while grabbing six rebounds on March 24, 2007, against the Charlotte Bobcats in Charlotte. The following game, on March 28 against the Indiana Pacers, Josh eclipsed his previous career-high by scoring 22 points on 11-for-13 shooting. He also posted his first double-double by grabbing 10 rebounds.\nIn late December 2007, Boone earned a spot in the starting lineup. He replaced Jason Collins as the starting center and contributed immediately, putting up a double-double almost every night. During the month of January, Boone was the target of a \"Hack-a-Shaq\" by Golden State Warriors coach Don Nelson, in which a player is intentionally fouled repeatedly to take advantage of his poor foul shooting. That season, Boone was second-worst in the NBA in free-throw percentage among players with at least one hundred attempts, at 45.6%\nBoone would see fewer minutes with the Nets, in part due to his free throw shooting. His accuracy at the line continued to deteriorate, as he hit 37.6% in 2008–09 and 32.8% in 2009–10. Only one player in the league with at least ten attempts had a lower percentage, Andris Biedrins, who made four of twenty-five attempts.\nPost-NBA.\nAfter not being re-signed by the Nets, Boone signed to play with the Zhejiang Golden Bulls of China, with whom he would play for parts of three seasons.\nOn January 17, 2013, Boone was acquired by the Iowa Energy of the NBA D-League. On January 26, after he had played in only two games, it was announced that Boone would miss the rest of the 2012–13 season with a knee injury.\nIn February 2014, Boone signed with the San Miguel Beermen as an import for the 2014 PBA Commissioner's Cup. He left the next month after just 2 games.\nOn March 22, 2014, Boone was re-acquired by the Iowa Energy.\nIn September 2014, Boone signed with Manama of the Bahraini Premier League. He went on to help Manama win their 19th championship in May 2015.\nOn September 9, 2015, Boone signed with BC Kalev/Cramo of Estonia.\nOn January 13, 2016, Boone signed with BC Khimki of Russia.

On October 24, 2016, he parted ways with Karşıyaka after appearing in only one game.\nOn December 24, 2016, Boone signed with Melbourne United of the Australian National Basketball League as an injury replacement player.\nOn February 21, 2017, Boone signed with the Hong Kong Eastern Long Lions of the ASEAN Basketball League. He helped the Long Lions win the championship after they defeated the Singapore Slingers in the ABL Finals.\nOn April 28, 2017, Boone re-signed with Melbourne United for the 2017–18 NBL season. On August 14, 2018, he re-signed with United for the 2018–19 NBL season.\nOn May 21, 2019, Boone signed with the Illawarra Hawks for 2019–20 NBL season.\nOn March 4, 2020, he has signed with Al Nasr of the UAE National Basketball League.

        "title": "Ken McMullen (baseball)",
        "text": "Kenneth Lee McMullen (born June 1, 1942) is an American former Major League Baseball third baseman. Born in Oxnard, California, he batted and threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nMcMullen signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers upon graduation from Oxnard High School. After two minor league seasons in which he batted .285 with 42 home runs and 177 runs batted in, McMullen made his major league debut as a September call-up in at just twenty years old. He collected three hits in eleven at-bats.\nHe was awarded the starting third base job out of Spring training , but after committing five errors while batting just .205 with one home run and three RBIs through April, he was optioned to triple A Spokane. After Manager Walter Alston shifted left fielder Tommy Davis to third, and tried several other players at third base, McMullen was brought back up from Spokane at the end of June. His first major league home run was a grand slam off the St. Louis Cardinals' Ernie Broglio on the Fourth of July. He raised his average to a far more respectable .236 by the end of the season while hitting five home runs with 28 RBIs. He pulled a hamstring on September 26 against the New York Mets and did not play in the World Series against the New York Yankees.\nHe started the season with the Dodgers, but poor fielding and a .209 batting average landed him back with the Spokane Indians by the middle of June. At the end of the season, he was traded with Frank Howard, Phil Ortega and Pete Richert to the Washington Senators for John Kennedy and Claude Osteen.\nWashington Senators.\nMcMullen won an everyday job batting second for Gil Hodges' Senators. Though he led the American League with 22 errors in , he soon earned a reputation as one of the slicker fielding third basemen in the AL. On August 13, 1965, he tied an AL record by starting four double plays against the Baltimore Orioles. On September 26, , he set an AL record with eleven assists from third against the Boston Red Sox (a mark later tied by Mike Ferraro). He led AL third basemen in total chances over three seasons from to , and led AL third basemen in double plays in 1967 and putouts in 1969.\nMcMullen had his first career multi-home run game on July 16, 1967. Later in the same month, he embarked on a career-high 19-game hit streak, which saw him hit a game-winning home run to end a twenty inning marathon with the Minnesota Twins on August 9. He batted a career-high .272 while driving in a career-high 87 runs in 1969. In all, he clubbed 86 home runs and drove in 327 during five plus seasons with the Senators. Shortly into the season, he was dealt to the California Angels for Rick Reichardt and Aurelio Rodríguez.\nCalifornia Angels.\nAfter a subpar first season in California, McMullen rebounded in to hit a career-high 21 home runs. On July 17, 1971, McMullen scored from third on a sacrifice bunt by Bruce Christensen, giving his rookie teammate his first major league RBI. He had a 17-game hit streak from July 23 to August 16, . On November 28, 1972, McMullen was part of a blockbuster trade, as he and Andy Messersmith were sent to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Billy Grabarkewitz, Frank Robinson, Bill Singer, Mike Strahler and Bobby Valentine.\nPinch hitter.\nMcMullen played the season opener at third base, but was soon displaced by rookie Ron Cey. From there, he served mostly as a pinch hitter, going six-for-nineteen with a walk, two home runs and nine RBIs in that role. He spent two more seasons backing up Cey and pinch hitting in Los Angeles, clubbing a pinch hit grand slam against the San Diego Padres on April 24, . He was released during Spring training , but soon after caught on with the Oakland Athletics. He spent one season in Oakland, serving primarily as a designated hitter and pinch hitter.\nHe spent his final season with the Milwaukee Brewers before retiring. He hit a pinch hit home run against the Seattle Mariners in his final career at bat.\nPersonal life.\nPrior to his 1973 season with the Dodgers, McMullen’s wife Bobbie (Goldie McMullen) was diagnosed with breast cancer. Three months pregnant at the time with the couple’s third child, she declined treatment that could have prematurely terminated her pregnancy. Her cancer treatment began after she gave birth to son Jonathan in November 1973. McMullen was able to continue with his baseball activities because of the insistence of his wife who died on April 6, . They had four children, Ryan, Tamara, Kenna and Jon.\nCareer.\nRobbed of the opportunity to play in the 1963 World Series by an injury, McMullen returned to the post-season in the twilight of his career with the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the 1974 National League Championship Series, he struck out against the Pittsburgh Pirates' Bruce Kison in his only post-season at-bat.\nExternal links.\n, or Baseball Almanac, or Baseball Biography, or Retrosheet"

        "title": "Rugby World Cup hosts",
        "text": "The Rugby World Cup host nation is selected by World Rugby at a meeting six years before each tournament. Each of the Rugby World Cups from 1987 to 2015 were hosted by countries that are considered the traditional powers in World Rugby. The first non Rugby Championship or Six Nations country to host a Rugby World Cup was Japan in 2019, after failed bids for the 2011 (awarded to New Zealand) and 2015 (awarded to England) tournaments.\nCurrent criteria.\nWorld Rugby requires for a country to host a Rugby World Cup, it must possess the necessary facilities. Stadiums must have a capacity at least 15,000, with the stadium for the final having a capacity of at least 60,000. The stadiums have other requirements, such as pitch size and floodlighting.\nWorld Rugby also looks for hosts that will either generate significant revenue or hosts that will spread the geographic reach of the sport. According to World Rugby Chairman Bernard Lapasset in 2008:\n\"As the revenue generation is vital to our ongoing development plans, we recognise that the World Cup has to be held in one of our senior core markets on a regular basis . . . However, the commercial success of the tournament also means we can now consider placing the tournament in new developing markets to assist the game's strategic growth.\"\nWorld Rugby also tends to rotate continents, with no continent to date hosting two consecutive World Cups.\nHosts by tournament.\n1987: New Zealand and Australia.\nThe first Rugby World Cup was hosted by Australia and New Zealand after the Australian Rugby Union and the New Zealand Rugby Union each independently wrote to the International Rugby Board seeking to conduct a World Cup tournament. The final was played in Auckland, New Zealand at Eden Park and won by New Zealand.\n1991: England, Ireland, Wales, France and Scotland.\nThe 1991 Rugby World Cup was jointly hosted by the Five Nations Championship countries (England, Ireland, Wales, France and Scotland), with games played all over these five European nations. Pool A, in which England played, saw half of the matches played in London, though games were also in Leicester, Gloucester and Otley. Pool B games involved European nations Scotland and Ireland, which had all their games in either Dublin or Edinburgh; one game was played in Belfast. Pool C included Wales, whose games were all played in Cardiff, with the other games in Pontypool, Pontypridd, and Llanelli. Pool D, of which France were a part, saw games played in Agen, Bayonne, Béziers Brive, Grenoble, and Toulouse. None of the quarter-finals or semi-finals was played in England. The final was played at the Rugby Football Union's Twickenham.\n1995: South Africa.\nThe 1995 World Cup was hosted and won by South Africa. The IRB broke new ground by awarding the tournament to an African nation, making it the first major sporting event ever held on the continent. This was also the first Rugby World Cup to be played entirely in one country.\nThe tournament is most remembered for two moments—the emergence of Jonah Lomu as a rugby superstar, and the trophy presentation. In one of the most emotional moments in sports history, President Nelson Mandela wore a Springbok jersey and matching baseball cap when presenting the trophy to the team's Afrikaner captain Francois Pienaar. Mandela's jersey had Pienaar's number 6 on the back. The presentation was widely seen as a sign of reconciliation between South Africa's black and white communities.\n1999: Wales.\nThe 1999 World Cup was hosted by Wales with some matches spread across Scotland, England, Ireland and France. The format of the pool games was similar to the 1991 World Cup in England. All Pool A games were held in Scotland, Pool B games in England, Pool C games in France, Pool D games were all held in Wales and Pool E games were all held in Ireland. Second round play-offs and the quarter-finals were held a variety of European venues, the semi-finals were held at Twickenham Stadium, London. The third place play-off and the final were held at the new Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\n2003: Australia.\nThe 2003 Cup was intended to be held jointly by Australia and New Zealand, but disagreements between the International Rugby Board and the NZRU, over sponsorship, advertising and ticketing, saw the competition played solely in Australia. This was the first and only tournament to date to be won by a team from the northern hemisphere. The 2003 World Cup saw matches played in eleven stadia in ten Australian cities.\n2007: France.\nUnlike the previous tournaments in 1991 and 1999 where five countries in Europe hosted matches, the IRB decided to award the right to host the 2007 tournament to one country.\nBoth England and France bid to host the tournament. England's bid included a two-tier tournament – a 16 team format, and a separate Nations Cup for emerging countries – and altering the structure of the qualifying tournament. France's bid had a traditional 20-team format to be held in September and October.\nThe IRB announced in April 2003 that France had won the right to host the tournament. The French bid won with 18 out of 21 votes, with IRB Chairman Syd Millar stating that \"The council was overwhelmingly of the view that the structure should remain as it is.\" The tournament was moved to the proposed September–October dates with the tournament structure remaining as it was. It was also announced that ten French cities would be hosting games, with the final at the Stade de France.\n2011: New Zealand.\nNew Zealand, Japan, and South Africa bid to host the tournament. South Africa was eliminated in the first round of IRB voting; in the second round, New Zealand won the vote 13 to 8, and the IRB Council awarded the hosting of the 2011 Rugby World Cup to New Zealand. The bidding occurred in November 2005, the first time that hosting rights had been awarded to a nation six years in advance. The voting procedure was managed by a team of independent auditors.\nSome bookmakers had initially made Japan the favourite to win the vote, reasoning that it was believed there was a desire to take the Rugby World Cup to a non-traditional rugby nation, and host the event in Asia for the first time. \nThere were also concerns about New Zealand's infrastructure, however an IRB fact-finding mission impressed the executives.\nSouth Africa had initially explored the possibility of inviting other African countries to stage some matches, and South Africa had also discussed with Argentina the possibility of hosting some matches in Buenos Aires. Ultimately, however, South Africa submitted a solo bid.\nAdditionally, the United States were discussed in the media as a country that might submit a bid, but the United States did not bid.\nJapan responded critically to the IRB's decision to award the 2011 World Cup to New Zealand, with the Japanese RFU chief Yoshiro Mori declaring:\n\"The established nations pass the ball around their friends . . . Only the interests of the bigger unions remain.\"\nDespite not winning the right to host the 2011 World Cup, Japan Rugby officials remained optimistic about future opportunities.\nJapan Rugby stated: \"We want to help with the spread of rugby fever . . . and we believe that dispersing rugby fever in the biggest continent on the planet will help the IRB in their mission of globalizing the game we all love.\"\nThe IRB defended its decision to award the 2011 World Cup to New Zealand instead of Japan, stating: \"New Zealand can guarantee packed stadiums and that can't be guaranteed in Japan.\"\n2015: England.\nThe host for the 2015 tournament was England, who won their bid on 28 July 2009. A record ten unions indicated formal interest in hosting the 2015 and/or the 2019 events: Australia, England, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Russia, Scotland, South Africa and Wales. Argentina had been reported in early 2008 as having given preliminary consideration to bidding, but did not ultimately formally indicate an interest in bidding.\n2019: Japan.\nThe host for the 2019 tournament was Japan, who won the right to host the tournament on 28 July 2009. Japan became the event's first-ever host outside of the sport's traditional top-tier nations.\n2023: France.\nSeveral countries declared their interest in hosting the 2023 Rugby World Cup, including ones that have already hosted RWC matches and countries looking to host a tournament for the first time.\nSouth Africa was considered one of the front runners to host the 2023 competition, having bid unsuccessfully for the right to host the 2011, 2015 and 2019 tournaments. Ireland submitted a formal bid, following the January 2014 establishment of a government taskforce to assess a bid to host the Rugby World Cup. Previous host nation France also submitted a bid to host again in 2023.\nThe United States, Argentina, and Italy had also expressed interest in hosting, but none of the three countries submitted a formal bid.\nOn 15 November 2017, it was announced that France had beaten rivals Ireland and South Africa, in its successful bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\n2027: Australia.\nAfter Argentina withdrew its bid, the Australian bid was the sole favourite for the 2027 Rugby World Cup host. During the annual meeting in Dublin on May 12 2022, the World Rugby Council unanimously approved Australia and the United States as the host tournament of the men's World Cup in 2027 and 2031, respectively.\n2031: United States.\nThe United States became the sole bid for the 2031 Rugby World Cup in November 2021. During the annual meeting in Dublin on May 12 2022, the World Rugby Council unanimously approved Australia and the United States as the host tournament of the men's World Cup in 2027 and 2031, respectively."

        "text": "David Moss (born December 28, 1981) is an American former professional ice hockey winger who last played for the EHC Biel of the NLA. He was a last round selection of the Calgary Flames, taken 220th overall, at the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. Moss has appeared in three outdoor games during his career: The 2001 Cold War while he was a member of the University of Michigan Wolverines, while a member of the United States National Team at the 2010 World Championship and at the 2011 Heritage Classic as a member of the Flames. Moss has been honored by his teams for his sportsmanship and dedication to the community on several occasions.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nMoss played a season of junior hockey with the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders of the United States Hockey League in 2000–01, scoring 20 goals and 38 points in 51 games. The Flames selected him in the seventh round of the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, 220th overall. He committed first to play for the University of Michigan Wolverines. In his freshman season of 2001–02, Moss played in the Cold War outdoor game before a then-world record crowd of 74,544.\nFollowing his 13-point freshman campaign, Moss scored 32 points in 2002–03 and was named the team's recipient of the Alton D. Simms Trophy as the Wolverine's most improved player. He was a two-time winner of the Howard Colby Award as Michigan's most sportsmanlike player, in 2002 and 2005. In four full seasons with the Wolverines, Moss scored 93 points in 163 games.\nProfessional.\nThe Flames assigned Moss to their top minor league affiliate, the Omaha Ak-Sar-Ben Knights of the American Hockey League (AHL), for the 2005–06 season. He led the team's rookies with 21 goals and 48 points. He remained with the Knights to begin the following season, but earned a recall to Calgary on December 19, 2006. Making his NHL debut that night, Moss scored his first goal, the game winning marker, in a 5–3 victory over the Los Angeles Kings. He added goals in his next two games, both against the Vancouver Canucks, to become the first player in Flames history to score in his first three NHL games. Moss finished the season with 18 points in 41 NHL games, and 21 points in 28 games with Omaha.\nMoss endured an injury-plagued season in 2007–08. He was unable to play the first two games of the season due to a shoulder injury while also losing time to head injuries and a leg injury that caused him to miss 19 games. He finished the season with only 4 goals in 41 games. Remaining healthy in 2008–09, Moss set career highs with 20 goals and 39 points in 81 games. He also scored his first career hat trick in a 6–3 win over the Ottawa Senators on March 3, 2009.\nAnother shoulder injury limited Moss early in the 2009–10 season. He scored only 17 points in 64 games for the Flames during the season. However, he made his debut with the United States National Team at the 2010 World Championship following the season. He appeared in six games for Team USA, scoring one goal and two assists, and played in the opening game against the host Germans at Veltins-Arena which set a new world attendance record of 77,803 (subsequently broken).\nDespite missing the first month of the season with another shoulder injury, Moss was on pace for a career season in 2010–11 when it was ended by a high-ankle sprain suffered after catching his skate in a rut during practice. Moss appeared in only 58 games, but scored 17 goals and 30 points. The Flames had moved Moss to center from his usual spot on right wing during the season, and he was centring the top line between Jarome Iginla and Alex Tanguay at the time of his latter injury. Prior to the end of his season, Moss played in his third outdoor game, the 2011 Heritage Classic between the Flames and Montreal Canadiens. Moss' injury problems continued into 2011–12 as an ankle injury that ultimately required surgery to repair kept him out of the lineup for 47 games.\nOn July 1, 2012 Moss signed a two-year contract with the Phoenix Coyotes.\nOn September 29, 2015 Moss signed a professional tryout contract with the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League. In November 2015, he inked a deal with EHC Biel of the Swiss NLA for the remainder of the 2015-16 season.\nOn October 19, 2016 Moss announced he was retiring from professional hockey.\nPersonal life.\nMoss, a native of Livonia, Michigan, attended and played high school hockey at Detroit Catholic Central High School. He earned a degree in sports management from the University of Michigan. His cousins Amanda, Blake and Phil Kessel are also hockey players.\nActive within the community, Moss donates $100 to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation for each assist scores and is a spokesman for the Reading... Give it a shot! program supporting literacy efforts in Calgary schools. The Flames recognized Moss for his charitable efforts in 2009, naming him that season's recipient of the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award, an annual team honor given to the player who \"best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, determination and leadership on the ice, combined with dedication to community service.\"\nMoss married \"\" contestant Erinn Lobdell on July 4, 2014. They currently have four children together."

        "text": "The 2005 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, Europe's primary club football competition. The showpiece event was contested between Liverpool of England and Milan of Italy at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey on 25 May 2005. Liverpool, who had won the competition four times, were appearing in their sixth final, and their first since 1985. Milan, who had won the competition six times, were appearing in their second final in three years and tenth overall.\nEach club needed to progress through the group stage and knockout rounds to reach the final, playing 12 matches in total. Liverpool finished second in their group behind 2004 runners-up AS Monaco and subsequently beat Bayer Leverkusen, Juventus and Chelsea to progress to the final. Milan won their group ahead of Barcelona and faced Manchester United, Inter Milan and PSV before reaching the final.\nMilan were regarded as favourites before the match and took the lead within the first minute through captain Paolo Maldini. Milan striker Hernán Crespo added two more goals before half-time to make it 3–0. In the second half Liverpool launched a comeback and scored three goals in a dramatic six-minute spell to level the scores at 3–3, with goals from Steven Gerrard, Vladimír Šmicer and Xabi Alonso. The scores remained the same during extra time, and a penalty shoot-out was required to decide the champions. The score was 3–2 to Liverpool when Andriy Shevchenko's penalty was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. It was Liverpool's fifth European Cup, which meant they were awarded the trophy permanently and the right to wear a multiple-winner badge. Liverpool's comeback gave rise to the final being known as the Miracle of Istanbul, and is regarded as one of the greatest finals in the history of the tournament.\nRoute to the final.\nTeams qualified for the Champions League group stage, either directly or through three preliminary rounds, based on both their position in the preceding domestic league and the strength of that league. Each club needed to progress through the group stage and knockout rounds to reach the final, playing 12 matches in total. Liverpool finished second in their group behind 2004 Champions League runners-up AS Monaco. In Liverpool's final group stage match against Olympiacos on 8 December, Steven Gerrard scored a 25-yard half volley in the 86th minute to send the club through to the knockout round. A strike that saw co-commentator Andy Gray exclaim, \"Oh, you beauty!! What a hit son! What a hit!\", Gerrard stated it was his most important, if not his best, goal for Liverpool to date. In the knockout rounds, Liverpool beat Bayer Leverkusen, Juventus and Chelsea to progress to the final. The winning goal in the semi-final scored by Luis García was dubbed a ghost goal by Chelsea manager José Mourinho. He did however recognise the atmosphere generated by Liverpool fans in the match: \"I felt the power of Anfield, it was magnificent.\"\nMilan won their group ahead of Barcelona and faced Manchester United, Inter Milan and PSV Eindhoven before reaching the final. Liverpool entered the competition in the third qualifying round after finishing fourth in the 2003–04 FA Premier League. They faced Austrian side Grazer AK and won the first leg 2–0 at Graz after two goals from captain Steven Gerrard. They lost the second leg 1–0 at Anfield but progressed to the group stage by virtue of winning the tie 2–1 on aggregate. Milan entered the competition in the group stage after winning Serie A. The group stages were contested as eight double round-robin groups of four teams, the top two qualifying for the knockout stages. Knockout ties were decided based on home and away matches.\nBuild-up.\nThe final was held at Atatürk Olympic Stadium, it was the first time a European final had been held in Turkey. There were reservations about holding the final in Turkey but UEFA chief executive, Lars-Christer Olsson was satisfied by the assurances of the Turkish authorities: \"The conditions there are the same, generally, as for all countries and they have given guarantees, this is important, especially since their experiences last autumn. We have also asked for additional investments in the infrastructure around the stadium and they have agreed to this, too.\" This was the Liverpool's sixth final and it was their first appearance since the 1985 European Cup final, when they lost 1–0 to Juventus and were subsequently banned from European competition for six years due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. They had previously won the European Cup on four occasions in 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1984. The match was Milan's tenth appearance in the final. They had won on six occasions (1963, 1969, 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003), and lost three times (1958, 1993, 1995). In total the teams had participated in 14 finals between them. Prior to the game, Milan were assured of entering the Champions League the following season after finishing second in Serie A. Liverpool meanwhile had failed to finish in the top four in the Premier League, and had to win the final to enter the competition the following season. Even if they did win the match, they were not assured of a place after UEFA failed to confirm whether they would allow Liverpool to defend the championship. The Football Association supported Liverpool, stating, \"We have already submitted a written request to have an additional place, should they win the Champions League\". Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti said \"I think a team that wins should have the right to defend it but we may just do the English federation a favour and solve this.\"\nEach team was allocated 20,000 tickets for the final, out of a total of 69,000. 14,400 tickets were made available to the general public, with half of those allocated through a ballot on UEFA's website, and the other half reserved for Turkish fans by the Turkish Football Federation. The final 14,600 tickets were distributed to UEFA's \"football family\", consisting of UEFA officials, national football associations, commercial partners and broadcasters. Hotel rooms in the city were scarce, with the 100,000 available quickly booked by travel agents and fans. At least 30,000 Liverpool fans made the trip to Istanbul, but only 20,000 were expected to have tickets. The BBC reported early arrivals were lively but there was no violence and the mood between the two fans was friendly.\nMilan were regarded as favourites and their team included many players who had experienced success in the competition. The most notable was captain Paolo Maldini, who had won the competition four times previously, all with Milan, and Clarence Seedorf who had won the competition three times with three clubs. Liverpool had been considered underdogs throughout the competition, but had beaten more favoured opposition, including Juventus and Chelsea, to reach the final. Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez acknowledged this: \"Maybe Milan are favourites, but we have confidence, and we can win\". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger felt Liverpool would win the match: \"I fancy Liverpool as Milan look jaded physically and certainly mentally, by losing the [Serie A] title, I think they have never had a better chance than now to beat Milan.\" Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was not so optimistic, stating that the Liverpool side were not as good as the one that had won the 2001 UEFA Cup Final: \"No disrespect to the squad we have got now but it is obvious we are not as strong as we were when we won the UEFA Cup in 2001. Back then we had a settled team and that season when we went into games against Barcelona and Roma, we always felt we were as good as them.\"\nMilan were expected to field a 4–4–2 formation, and there was much speculation about who would partner Andriy Shevchenko in attack. Filippo Inzaghi and Jon Dahl Tomasson were touted, but it was expected that on-loan striker Hernán Crespo would be chosen. This was echoed by Milan manager Ancelotti: \"I will not say if he will play from the start, but he will definitely play.\" Liverpool were also expected to adopt a 4–4–2 formation. Dietmar Hamann was expected to start ahead of Igor Bišćan, and when questioned over whether Djibril Cissé or Milan Baroš would start as main striker, Benítez replied, \"Both are good enough, maybe both can play, why not?\"\nThe referee for the final was Manuel Mejuto González, who led an all-Spanish crew of officials. His assistant referees were Oscar Martínez Samaniego and Clemente Ayete Plou, and the fourth official was Arturo Daudén Ibáñez. Mejuto González was only the third Spanish referee to officiate a European Cup final, following Manuel Díaz Vega in 1996 and José María Ortiz de Mendíbil in 1969.\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nLiverpool fielded a 4–4–1–1 formation, with the surprise inclusion in the squad being Harry Kewell, who played just behind Milan Baroš, who himself had been picked ahead of Djibril Cissé. The inclusion of Kewell meant Dietmar Hamann was left on the substitutes' bench and Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard started in the centre of midfield. Milan fielded a 4–4–2 diamond formation, with Hernán Crespo preferred to Jon Dahl Tomasson and Filippo Inzaghi, who was not included in the match day squad. Liverpool lined up in their red home kit, whilst Milan wore a changed strip of all white, which they historically used in European Cup finals. Liverpool won the coin toss and kicked off.\nMilan scored within the first minute of the match after captain Paolo Maldini volleyed in an Andrea Pirlo free kick that had been conceded by Djimi Traoré. The goal made Maldini the oldest scorer in the history of the competition. Liverpool responded almost immediately; John Arne Riise, who was picked out by a corner kick from Steven Gerrard, hit a volley from the edge of the penalty box. His shot was cleared only for Gerrard to cross in from the right wing, which Sami Hyypiä headed towards goal producing a save out of Dida. Milan almost extended their lead in the 13th minute, after Crespo's header was cleared off the goal line by Luis García. A few minutes later, Liverpool made a substitution after Harry Kewell picked up a groin injury; he was replaced by Vladimír Šmicer. Soon after, Kaká passed through to Andriy Shevchenko who put his shot past Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, but Shevchenko was adjudged to have been in an offside position and the goal did not stand. Shevchenko had another chance to score a few minutes later; after being played onside by Traore, his shot was saved by Dudek after he came under pressure from the Liverpool defence. Luis García had two chances to score following Shevchenko's shot; the first shot from the edge of the penalty area went well over the crossbar and after he was headed through by Baroš his next shot went wide. Straight after this attack, Crespo went through on goal only to be flagged for offside. Almost immediately after this, Liverpool had a penalty claim turned down after Alessandro Nesta allegedly handballed. Milan countered and scored; Kaka dribbled the ball into the Liverpool half and passed to Shevchenko, who passed to Crespo at the far post to score and make it 2–0. Minutes later, Crespo extended Milan's lead with a chip over Dudek after Kaka provided the assist to make it 3–0.\nSecond half.\nAt the start of the second half, Liverpool made a substitution with Dietmar Hamann replacing Steve Finnan and also changed to a 3–4–2–1 formation to reduce the deficit, with Riise and Šmicer on the flanks, Alonso and Hamann as holding midfielders and Gerrard playing as an attacking midfielder. Liverpool had the best chance early on with Xabi Alonso sending an effort from narrowly past Milan's right hand post. Two minutes later, Shevchenko forced a save from Dudek with a strong free-kick from just outside the Liverpool box.\nA minute after this, Liverpool scored through captain Gerrard, who connected with Riise's cross and lofted a header past Dida. Soon afterwards, Liverpool scored again as Šmicer beat Dida with a long-range shot into the bottom left-hand corner to leave Liverpool a goal behind. Three minutes after Šmicer's goal, Liverpool were awarded a penalty, after Gerrard made a run into the Milan box for Baros' lay-off and was brought down by Gennaro Gattuso. Alonso's penalty was saved, but he scored from the rebound to equalise for Liverpool. Milan and Liverpool had chances to take the lead after this, but Clarence Seedorf and Riise failed to score.\nMilan almost took the lead in the 70th minute, after Dudek dropped a low cross towards Shevchenko, whose effort was cleared off the line by Traoré. Gerrard then had a chance to score but he sent his shot over the crossbar. About ten minutes later García could not control a pass from Gerrard which led to a Milan attack, Crespo played the ball back to Kaka, whose subsequent shot was blocked by Jamie Carragher. A number of substitutions were made before the end of full-time with Liverpool replacing Milan Baroš with Djibril Cissé, while Milan replaced Hernán Crespo and Clarence Seedorf with Jon Dahl Tomasson and Serginho respectively. Milan had the last chance before full-time but Kaka failed to direct Jaap Stam's header towards goal, meaning the final would go to extra time for the 13th time in the competition's history.\nExtra time.\nLiverpool kicked off the first half of extra time. Pirlo had a chance in the early stages, but he put his shot over the crossbar. Tomasson came close in the later stages of the first period of extra time, but he could not make contact with the ball. Šmicer required treatment for cramp towards the end of the first period, as a number of Liverpool players felt fatigued. Liverpool had the most of the early exchanges after winning two corners, but could not score. Shortly afterwards, Milan made their final substitution, replacing Gennaro Gattuso with Rui Costa.\nThe best chance of the second half of extra time came in the 117th minute (three minutes from penalties) when Shevchenko shot at goal. Dudek saved, only for it to rebound back out to Shevchenko, who again shot from under , which Dudek saved again, pushing the shot over the bar. Liverpool had one last chance at the end of extra time, but John Arne Riise's free kick was blocked, and following this the referee signalled the end of extra time, which meant a penalty shoot-out would decide the championship.\nPenalties.\nLiverpool and Milan had each won their last European Cups after winning penalty shoot-outs, and it was also the second time in three years that the final would be decided this way; previously, in the 2003 all-Italian final at Old Trafford, Milan had defeated Juventus 3–2. Milan were first to take a penalty, but Serginho – who had taken Milan's first penalty in 2003 and scored – shot over the crossbar after attempts from Dudek to distract him, which mimicked Bruce Grobbelaar's \"spaghetti legs\" antics during the shootout in the 1984 final against Roma. Dietmar Hamann took Liverpool's first penalty and, despite having a broken toe, he scored to put Liverpool 1–0 up. Andrea Pirlo was next for Milan, and his penalty was saved by Dudek who dived low to his right. Cisse then scored his penalty to put Liverpool 2–0 up. Tomasson scored Milan's next penalty to make the score 2–1 in Liverpool's favour. Riise was next for Liverpool, but his penalty was saved by Dida. Kaká then scored the subsequent penalty to level the scores at 2–2. Šmicer took the next Liverpool penalty and scored with his eventual last competitive kick for Liverpool to put them on the brink of victory.\nShevchenko, who had scored the decisive penalty against Juventus' Gianluigi Buffon in 2003, then had to score to keep Milan in the shootout. He hit his penalty straight down the middle of the goal and Dudek went down to his right, but blocked the shot with his left hand to give Liverpool a 3–2 win in the shoot-out.\nPost-match events.\nLiverpool's triumph marked their fifth European Cup and the first by an English team since Manchester United had defeated Bayern Munich in the 1999 final in Barcelona. By winning the European Cup for a fifth time, Liverpool earned the privilege of wearing a multiple-winner badge and the right to keep the trophy (under normal competition rules, the winning club can keep the trophy for only 10 months, as they must deliver it to UEFA two months before the next year's final). Liverpool were given ownership of the trophy every winner had held aloft since 1995 (after Milan were permanently given the previous trophy after their fifth win in 1994). The 2005–06 participants competed for a new identical trophy. The rule to keep the trophy, which had been in effect since the 1968–69 season, was changed for the 2009–10 season so that the actual trophy remained with UEFA at all times. Liverpool became the fifth and final club to be given this honour after Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Milan – all of whom had either won at least five times (six in Real Madrid's case) or three times consecutively.\nLiverpool celebrated their victory by parading the trophy around Liverpool in an open-top double-decker bus the day after the final. They were cheered by approximately 1 million supporters, with an estimated 300,000 fans located around St George's Hall – the final destination of the parade. Business experts estimated that one in five workers took time off following the victory. It was also estimated that Liverpudlians drank around 10,000 bottles of champagne after the match, with supermarket chain Sainsbury's stating: \"We've never seen anything like it. We would usually expect to sell this much champagne at Christmas\".\nLiverpool manager Rafael Benítez admitted after the match that the manner of his side's victory had stunned him and he stated: \"My problem is that I don't have words to express the things that I feel at this moment\". Praise for Liverpool also came from outside England, including from Argentine legend Diego Maradona, who said, \"Even the Brazil team that won the 1970 World Cup could not have staged a comeback with Milan leading 3–0...The English club proved that miracles really do exist. I've now made Liverpool my English team. They showed that football is the most beautiful sport of all. You knew they could defend, but the team showed they could play too and wrote a page in the history books. The match will last forever. The Liverpool supporters didn't let me go to sleep the night before. There were 10 of them to every three Milan supporters. They showed their unconditional support at half-time when they were losing 3–0 and still they didn't stop singing.\"\nBenítez was also prepared to break up his winning side after the final with a number of players expected to leave the club to make way for new arrivals. One of those leaving was Vladimír Šmicer, who had scored Liverpool's second goal in Istanbul, and whose contract was known not to be renewed before the final, meaning he entered knowing the final was his last game for the club. Milan were similarly astonished at the manner in which they had lost the final. Manager Carlo Ancelotti said, \"We had six minutes of madness in which we threw away the position we had reached until then\". The result compounded Milan's failure to win Serie A a week before the match. Milan's vice-president, Adriano Galliani, played down the loss, asserting: \"Even if we come second in the league, and second in the Champions League, this is not a disastrous season for us\". Captain Paolo Maldini was less optimistic, stating that the reverse was a \"huge disappointment\", but he added that Milan would accept the defeat and \"go out with their heads high\".\nMuch discussion after the final centered on the future of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard who had been linked with a move to rivals Chelsea. Gerrard stated in the immediate aftermath of the victory, \"How can I think of leaving Liverpool after a night like this?\" Media reports then quoted Gerrard as saying he wished to leave Liverpool, citing events that had occurred in the month after the Champions League victory as the reason. On 6 July, however, Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry released a statement confirming that Gerrard would remain at the club, and Gerrard signed a new four-year contract on 8 July. He ultimately never played for another club in Europe, as he departed for the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer a decade later.\nDespite winning the competition, Liverpool's place in next season's Champions League was still in doubt. Prior to the 2005 Champions League final, The Football Association had decided on 5 May that only the top four finishers in the Premier League would qualify and Liverpool ended their domestic season in fifth place behind Everton. UEFA initially maintained that each country could only have four Champions League spots and suggested that the FA could nominate Liverpool instead of Everton. Liverpool faced a three-week wait to discover if they would be allowed to defend their title as all previous winners of the competition had done. UEFA came to a decision on 10 June, confirming that both Everton and Liverpool would be able to compete in the Champions League; however, Liverpool were entered into the first qualifying round, and were given no \"country protection\"; meaning they could face another English club at any stage of the competition. The UEFA Executive Committee also amended the regulations for future competitions so that the holders would have the right to defend their title and therefore qualify automatically, though at the expense of the lowest placed team in those countries that had more than one qualifier.\nAs champions, Liverpool faced CSKA Moscow (winners of the 2005 UEFA Cup Final) in the 2005 UEFA Super Cup, held on 26 August. Liverpool won the match 3–1 after extra time. Liverpool's victory in Istanbul also meant they qualified for the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship. Liverpool beat Deportivo Saprissa 3–0 in the semi-final, and played Copa Libertadores champions São Paulo in the final, losing 1–0.\nBoth teams retained a number of players who played in this final for the rematch in the 2007 final in Athens, which Milan won 2–1. Many players who played in this game also played for their clubs' legends teams, Liverpool Legends and Milan Glorie, in Liverpool's 2019 Legends Game at Anfield; Robbie Fowler and Cissé put Liverpool 2–0 up before Pirlo and Giuseppe Pancaro brought Milan level. Gerrard then scored in the final minute of play to give Liverpool a 3–2 win. The match raised an estimated £1 million for the LFC Foundation.\nIn a 2011 poll conducted by \"UEFA.com\", Dudek's double save from Shevchenko in the 117th minute was voted the greatest Champions League moment of all time, ahead of Zinedine Zidane's left-footed volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 final and Ole Gunnar Solskjær's injury-time winner against Bayern Munich in 1999 for Manchester United. On the second save from inside 3 yards, Dudek wrote in his autobiography: \"They called the 2005 Champions League final the 'Miracle of Istanbul'. Well, this was my miracle. The save of my career. Of my life.\" When asked to explain his saves after the game, an emotional Dudek said he took inspiration from Pope John Paul II (a fellow Pole and goalkeeper in his youth) who died in April, the month before the final. \"I'm dedicating this to the memory of John Paul. I had contact with him during his life and I've felt the inspiration since his death. I can't account for it.\" Dudek dubbed it the \"Hand of Pope\", an allusion to Diego Maradona dubbing his infamous first goal in the 1986 World Cup quarter final the \"Hand of God\".\nIn popular culture.\nThe 2014 British comedy movie \"One Night in Istanbul\" is set in Istanbul on the night of the final, and includes some footage from the match.\nThe 2011 British sports drama \"Will\" (starring Liverpool fan Damian Lewis) centres on the trials and tribulations in the lives of two main fictional characters: eleven-year-old Will Brennan and Bosnian footballer Alek, and their trek to see Liverpool play Milan in the 2005 Champions League final.\nThe final is discussed in author John Green's podcast \"The Anthropocene Reviewed,\" and the essay was later adapted for Green's book of the same name\".\""

Numerous more have been selected since then.\nIn the 1970s the PRC enjoyed the greatest successes, in 1974 Des Lock represented New Zealand at the World Rowing Championships, Bill Vine represented New Zealand as the New Zealand Colts Manager, and a young Viv Harr represented New Zealand as a New Zealand Colt. In the 1975 World Rowing Championships the selection of a Petone club member was repeated by Ian Boserio. Ruby Willis was selected for the World Rowing Junior Championships held in Rio in 2015.\nPetone club members have completed at the Henley Regatta. \nMany Petone rowers hold world records for time trails at indoor racing events that are held all over the world, including Izzy Ahearn who in 2016 obtained the world indoor rowing record across a marathon distance for girls aged between 15 and 16.\nNational achievements.\nPetone Rowing Club was named Rowing New Zealand's club of the year in 2014.\nUniform.\nWhen the club was first formed the uniform was very different from the one we see today. It consisted of white trousers, a white cap with red buttons, a white singlet with a broad red sash, and a boater hat with a red band. By the 1960s the uniform had changed to gold singlets and black shorts. Currently the Petone uniform is fluorescent yellow singlets and black shorts.\nRoll of Honour.\nWorld War I and World War II both had huge effects on most societies around the world. Petone Rowing Club was not excluded from this. Twenty one men fought in World War I from Petone rowing club. Four of these men lost their lives. Sixty-two men fought in World War II and seven of them lost their lives."

        "text": "Rowing New Zealand is the sports governing body for rowing in New Zealand. Its purpose is to provide leadership and support to enable an environment of success for the New Zealand rowing community. This includes secondary schools, clubs, masters, universities and high performance.\nRowing New Zealand was founded as the New Zealand Amateur Rowing Association on 16 March 1887. The New Zealand Amateur Rowing Association was formed by nine clubs in an effort to coordinate and regulate the sport of amateur rowing in New Zealand.\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Rowing New Zealand has had moderate success on the water, which has resulted in increased media interest in the sport of rowing and record participation at secondary school level. The aim is eventually to replicate the success of Great Britain and Australia on the water by the 2020 Olympics. This increase in the number of active rowers has been attributed in particular to Rob Waddell's gold medal victory at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. There have also been increases, particularly in the number of women rowers, since Georgina Evers-Swindell and Caroline Evers-Swindell won gold at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games.\nThe 2008 Olympic trials gained intense public and media interest as previous Olympic champion Rob Waddell challenged current world champion Mahé Drysdale for the sole men’s single sculls spot. In the final race, Waddell suffered a repeat of his atrial fibrillation condition, resulting in Drysdale claiming the victory and the sole 2008 Olympic single sculls spot.\nWaddell was then selected into the double sculls with the young Nathan Cohen, world champion at the 2006 World University Games in single sculls, in early 2008. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park, Shunyi, Beijing in August 2008, the two finished fourth in the double sculls final.\nCohen won the gold medal in double sculls at the next Olympic Games in 2012, with rowing partner Joseph Sullivan.\nCohen and Sullivan also won the World Championship in both 2010 and 2011.\nMembership.\nSixty-eight clubs are affiliated to Rowing New Zealand. Clubs within New Zealand are affiliated to their regional rowing associations, which include the Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Canterbury, East Coast, Marlborough, Otago, Southland, Waikato, Whanganui and Wellington Rowing Associations.\nOther members affiliated with Rowing New Zealand include the New Zealand Secondary Schools Rowing Association (NZSSRA), the New Zealand Universities Rowing Council, the New Zealand Rowing Race Officials Association, Regional Performance Centres (RPCs), Karapiro Rowing and Ruataniwha Rowing. RPCs provide a pathway for rowers to compete for selection in national representative crews as well as providing a high performance training environment for rowers. Karapiro Rowing and Ruataniwha Rowing operate and maintain the country's two main rowing venues: Lake Karapiro near Cambridge in the North Island, and Lake Ruataniwha near Twizel in the South Island.\nNational teams.\nRowing New Zealand selects Elite, Development, Under 23, Under 21, Junior and Under 18 National Teams through selection camps and trials process. The Elite National Team represents New Zealand at the highest level of competition, either at the Olympic Games, World Championships or the Rowing World Cup. While the Olympics are held once every four years, the World Championships are held every year. The Rowing World Cup comprises 3 regattas held each year and overall winners are determined by points that are awarded to the top finishing boats at each event.\nThe Under 23 National Team competes at the Under 23 World Championship regatta each year while the Under 21 National Team competes at the Youth Cup Regatta in Australia.\nThe Junior National Team competes at the Junior World Championships each year and the Under 18 crews from the North Island and the South Island are selected annually to compete against one another.\nResults.\n2010 World Championship Regatta.\nRowing New Zealand hosted the 2010 World Championship Regatta at Lake Karapiro, 12–19 September. New Zealand secured the rights to hold the 39th World Rowing Championship in 2006 and, in doing so, became one of only a handful of world rowing nations that have held more than one championship. At the official Closing Ceremony, FISA President Denis Oswald said: \"I praise the Organising Committee for having staged such an outstanding event and I include all members of the Organising Committee and volunteers who have been so helpful and friendly to us. It won't take 32 years until we come back. Karapiro 2010 brought the World Championships to new standards and set a new model.\"\nThe first time the event came to New Zealand was in 1978. The 2010 event joins the 1978 event as being considered by many of the rowing community worldwide as being amongst the greatest ever world championships.\n2005 World Championship Regatta.\nThe 2005 World Championship Regatta was one of the most successful event for Rowing New Zealand and New Zealand sport when four gold medals were won within 45 minutes, making New Zealand the most successful country at the regatta.\nThe four victories were:"

        "title": "Doping at the Tour de France",
        "text": "There have been allegations of doping in the Tour de France since the race began in 1903. Early Tour riders consumed alcohol and used ether, among other substances, as a means of dulling the pain of competing in endurance cycling. Riders began using substances as a means of increasing performance rather than dulling the senses, and organizing bodies such as the \"Tour\" and the International Cycling Union (UCI), as well as government bodies, enacted policies to combat the practice.\nUse of performance-enhancing drugs in cycling predates the Tour de France. Cycling, having been from the start a sport of extremes, whether of speed by being paced by tandems, motorcycles and even cars, or of distance, the suffering involved encouraged the means to alleviate it. Not until after World War II were sporting or even particularly health issues raised. Those came shortly before the death of Tom Simpson in the Tour de France of 1967. Max Novich referred to the Tour de France in a 1973 issue of \"New York State Journal of Medicine\" as \"a cycling nightmare\". Journalist Hans Halter wrote in 1998 that \"For as long as the Tour has existed, since 1903, its participants have been doping themselves. For 60 years doping was allowed. For the past 30 years it has been officially prohibited. Yet the fact remains; great cyclists have been doping themselves, then and now.\"\nEarly doping in cycling.\nDrug-taking in cycling predates the Tour de France. \"It existed, it has always existed\", said the French reporter and author, Pierre Chany, who followed 49 Tours before his death in 1996. The exhaustion of six-day races on the track was countered by the riders' soigneurs (the French word for \"carer\"), helpers akin to seconds in boxing. Among the treatments they supplied was nitroglycerine, a drug used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and which was credited with improving riders' breathing. Riders suffered hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs. The American champion Major Taylor refused to continue the New York race, saying: \"I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand.\"\nAlso used was strychnine, which in small doses tightened tired muscles. A track rider of the era said he had developed such a tolerance to the drug that he took doses large enough to kill smaller men. The use of strychnine, far from being banned, was thought necessary to survive demanding races, says the sports historian Alain Lunzenfichter.\nThe American specialist in doping, Max M. Novich, wrote: \"Trainers of the old school who supplied treatments which had cocaine as their base declared with assurance that a rider tired by a six-day race would get his second breath after absorbing these mixtures.\" John Hoberman, a professor at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas, said six-day races were \"de facto experiments investigating the physiology of stress as well as the substances that might alleviate exhaustion.\"\nThe first backers of races on the road were newspapers. Although \"Le Vélocipède Illustré\", which was behind the world's first long-distance road race in November 1869, said its purpose was \"to further the good cause of the bicycle\" because \"it must be determined that the bicycle can be raced over considerable distances with incomparably less fatigue than running\", backing the race would also boost the newspaper's sales. In an era before radio and television, newspapers could build the drama of a race for weeks, rely on customers buying a further copy on the day to prepare for the riders to pass and then another next day to see what had become of them. Few people had travelled 130 km, at least not often, and the idea of doing it by bicycle and at as high a speed as possible when the roads were potholed and bicycles had wooden wheels and metal tyres was exciting. The result was that newspapers outdid each other in promotions. In 1891 came a race from Bordeaux to Paris. In the same year, \"Le Petit Journal\" went twice as far by running Paris–Brest–Paris over 1,200 km.\nDuring a meeting at \"L'Auto\" in Paris, journalist Géo Lefèvre suggested a race right round France, not just one day but six, \"like the six-day races on the track.\" The idea of bringing the excess of the indoors to the roads of the outdoors was born. And with it came the practices which had seen riders through their suffering.\n1903–1940s: Doping as acceptable means.\nThe strongest drug in the early Tour de France was strychnine. Other than that, riders would take anything to survive the tedium, the pain and the exhaustion of stages that could last more than 300 km. That included alcohol, which was already strong in French culture and sometimes purer than water after World War I destroyed water pipes and polluted water tables, and ether. There are photographs of riders holding ether-soaked handkerchiefs to their mouths, or leaving them knotted under the chin so the fumes would deaden the pain in their legs. The smell, enough to turn a man's stomach said Pierre Chany, discouraged some but also showed the extent of suffering by others. Roger Lapébie, winner of the Tour in 1937, said he smelled ether \"in the bunch near the finish; it used to be taken in a little bottle called a \"topette\".\" Its use lasted decades; riders were caught using it as late as 1963.\nThe acceptance of drug-taking in the Tour de France was so complete by 1930, when the race changed to national teams that were to be paid for by the organisers, that the rule book distributed to riders by the organiser, Henri Desgrange, reminded them that drugs were not among items with which they would be provided. In a 1949 interview with Fausto Coppi, the 1949 and 1952 Tour winner, he admitted to amphetamine use and said \"those who claim [that cyclists do not take amphetamine], it's not worth talking to them about cycling\".\nThe Convicts of the Road.\nIn 1924 the journalist Albert Londres followed the Tour de France for the French newspaper, \"Le Petit Parisien\". At Coutances he heard that the previous year's winner, Henri Pélissier, his brother Francis and a third rider, Maurice Ville, had pulled out after a row with the organiser, Henri Desgrange. Henri Pélissier explained the problem – whether or not he had the right to take off a jersey – and went on to talk of drugs, reported in Londres' race diary, in which he coined the phrase \"Les Forçats de la Route\" (The Convicts of the Road):\nHenri spoke of being as white as shrouds once the dirt of the day had been washed off, then of their bodies being drained by diarrhoea, before continuing:\nFrancis Pélissier said much later: \"Londres was a famous reporter but he didn't know about cycling. We kidded him a bit with our cocaine and our pills. Even so, the Tour de France in 1924 was no picnic.\"\n1950s–1960s: Early anti-doping stance.\nPierre Dumas was the first doctor to campaign for the testing and suppression of doping, both within cycling and then at international level at the Olympic Games. Dumas came to the Tour de France in 1952 when the original doctor pulled out. Dumas was a judoka rather than a cyclist and had none of the preconceptions established in cycling. He discovered a world in which \"there were soigneurs, fakirs, who came from the six-days. Their value was in the contents of their case. Riders took anything they were given, even bee stings and toad extract.\" He spoke of \"medicine from the heart of Africa... healers laying on hands or giving out irradiating balms, feet plunged into unbelievable mixtures which could lead to eczema, so-called magnetised diets and everything else you could imagine. In 1953 and 1954 it was all magic, medicine and sorcery. After that, they started reading Vidal [the French medicine directory].\"\nSuch was the extent to which stronger drugs entered cycling that the French team manager, Marcel Bidot, was cited to an inquiry by the Council of Europe as saying: \"Three-quarters of riders were doped. I am well placed to know that since I visited their rooms each evening during the Tour. I always left frightened after these visits.\" At the 1956 Tour, it was evident how much drug-taking and the \"care\" of riders had changed. After stage 14, all members of the Belgian team chose to abandon the race following a \"mystery illness\". Insiders suspected doping usage as the real reason, while the team attributed the illness to a dinner of 'bad fish' they had eaten, an excuse which was reused in both 1962 and 1991.\nIn 1960, Pierre Dumas walked into a hotel bedroom on his nightly tour of teams to find eventual winner Gastone Nencini prone on his bed with a plastic tube running from each arm to a bottle containing hormones. However, the hormone injection was not illegal at the time, and indeed only few were disqualified or sanctioned whenever they were found out to use doping.\nMalléjac incident.\nOn stage 12 of the 1955 Tour, the riders went over Mount Ventoux. Ten kilometres from the summit, said the journalist Jacques Augendre, French rider Jean Malléjac was: \"Streaming with sweat, haggard and comatose, he was zigzagging and the road wasn't wide enough for him... He was already no longer in the real world, still less in the world of cyclists and the Tour de France.\" Malléjac collapsed, falling to the ground with one foot still trapped in a pedal. The other leg pedalled on in the air. He was, said Pierre Chany, \"completely unconscious, his face the colour of a corpse, a freezing sweat ran on his forehead.\nMalléjac was hauled to the side of the road by Sauveur Ducazeaux, an official of another team, and Dumas summoned. Georges Pahnoud of the \"Télégramme de Brest\" reported:\nDumas had to strap Malléjac down for the journey to hospital at Avignon. Mallejac insisted that he had been given a drugged bottle from a soigneur, whom he did not name, and said that while his other belongings had reached the hospital intact, the bottle had been emptied and could not be analysed. Malléjac insisted that he wanted to start legal proceedings, and Dumas said: \"I'm prepared to call for a charge of attempted murder.\" The incident was never resolved, however, with Mallejac returning for subsequent Tours and denying any wrongdoing for the rest of his life.\nToo drugged to pull on the brakes.\nIn the 1960 Tour, Roger Rivière was second to the Italian Gastone Nencini, a rider he planned to beat by tagging along with him in the mountains and then speeding away on the flat. The problem was that Nencini was lighter and a better climber and that he was such a fast descender that, in the view of another French rider, Raphaël Géminiani, \"the only reason to follow Nencini downhill is if you've got a death wish.\"\nRivière was able to stay with Nencini on the climb to the Col de Perjuret, as the pair crossed the summit together. Then came a series of descending zigzags. Nencini took the perfect line and Rivière, trying to match him, overshot a bend, fell into a ravine, and broke his back. There he was found by his teammate, Louis Rostollan.\nRivière quickly passed the blame for his fall and his broken back on the team mechanic, accusing him of leaving oil on the wheels and the brakes for not working. The mechanic was outraged, and the doctors soon found the real reason – that so much painkiller was in Rivière's blood that his hands were too slow to operate the brakes. He had taken a heavy dose of the opioid painkiller dextromoramide (Palfium), to help him stay with Nencini on Col de Perjuret. Rivière later admitted to being a drug addict, telling a newspaper how he had doped to beat the world hour record, and admitted downing thousands of tablets a year.\nWiel's affair.\nThe stage from Luchon to Carcassonne in 1962 set off 10 minutes later than scheduled because the German rider, Hans Junkermann, had been ill most of the night. At first he was not going to start. When he said that after all he felt well enough, the organisers gave him the extra time to get ready. Junkermann was leader of the Wiel's–Groene Leeuw team and was allowed his privilege because he was in eighth position.\nJunkermann soon dropped to the back of the field and after 50 km he lost contact. On the first hill he got off his bike and sat by the roadside. \"I ate bad fish at the hotel last night\", he told onlookers. The same complaint came all day. A total twenty riders fell ill, and eleven others abandoned the Tour that day, including the former leader, Willy Schroeders, the 1960 winner Gastone Nencini and a future leader, Karl-Heinz Kunde.\nJacques Goddet wrote that he suspected doping but nothing was proven – other than that none of the hotels the previous night had served fish, the hoteliers being anxious to clear their reputation. Pierre Dumas spoke of \"certain preparations\" and speculated the riders were given the same tainted drug by one of the soigneurs. Team managers grew angry at the several days of newspaper reporting that followed and came close to calling for a strike.\n1965: Criminalization of doping.\nIn 1960, the Danish rider Knud Enemark Jensen collapsed during the 100 km team time trial at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome and died later in hospital. The autopsy showed he had taken amphetamine and another drug, Ronicol, which dilates the blood vessels. Pierre Dumas then led a committee of doctors demanding tests at the following Games. A national anti-doping law entered French legislation in June 1965. Performance-enhancing drugs were now illegal in France, and the first anti-doping testing began at the 1966 Tour. That year, amphetamine use in France was running at almost a third of those tested.\nAlec Taylor, team manager of rider Tom Simpson who died following doping usage in the 1967 Tour, said officials treated controls in fear, knowing what was there, afraid of what they might find.\nFirst anti-doping test and a strike.\nTesters arrived at the Tour de France for the first time in 1966, in Bordeaux, although only after word had spread and many riders had left their hotels. The first competitor they found was Raymond Poulidor, who became the first rider to be tested in the Tour. He said:\nA few other riders were found, including Rik Van Looy; some obliged and others refused. Next morning, the race left the city on the way to the Pyrenees and stopped in the suburb of Gradignan, in the university area of La House. The riders climbed off and began walking, shouting protests in general and in particular abuse at Pierre Dumas, whom some demanded should also take a test to see if he had been drinking wine or taking aspirin to make his own job easier.\nDeath of Tom Simpson.\nTom Simpson was the leader of the British team in the 1967 Tour de France. At the start of stage 13 on Thursday 13 July, he was still suffering the effects of a stomach bug he had endured earlier in the race. It was a blisteringly hot day, and he was seen to drink brandy during the early parts of the stage. In those years, the organisers limited each rider to four bottles of water, about two litres – the effects of dehydration being poorly understood. During races, riders often raided roadside bars and cafes for drinks, and filled their bottles from fountains.\nAbout two kilometres from the summit of the day's main climb, Mont Ventoux, Simpson began to zig-zag across the road, eventually falling against an embankment. While his team-car helpers wanted him to retire from the race, Simpson insisted on being put back on his cycle and he continued for another 500 m or so before again beginning to falter; he toppled unconscious into the arms of his helpers, still gripping his handlebars. A motorcycle policeman summoned Pierre Dumas, who took over team officials' first attempts at saving Simpson, including mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Dumas massaged Simpson's heart and gave him oxygen. A race helicopter then took Simpson to hospital but Simpson was declared dead soon after his arrival.\nDrug usage was only hinted at in the news coverage, particularly by Jacques Goddet, who referred in L'Équipe to Simpson's \"errors in the way he looked after himself.\" Then a British reporter, J. L. Manning, broke the news that two empty tubes and a third full of amphetamines were found in the pocket of his jersey. Manning was a serious and well-respected journalist. His exposure, the first time a formal connection had been made between drugs and Simpson's death, set off a wave of similar reporting in Britain and elsewhere. The following month, Manning went further, in a piece headed \"Evidence in the case of Simpson who crossed the frontier of endurance without being able to know he had 'had enough'\":\nSteroids and allied drugs.\nDuring 1974, a number of riders failed tests for amphetamines, including Claude Tollet at the Tour. In 1977, a test for amphetamine-like drug Pemoline was perfected, catching five-time Tour de France winner Eddy Merckx among others. Far from abandoning drugs, riders and their helpers concentrated on finding alternatives that could not be detected. Five-time Tour de France winner Jacques Anquetil argued that stopping riders using amphetamine would not stop doping, but merely lead riders to use more dangerous drugs. In the 1970s, cycling moved into the steroid era. According to Dr Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, steroids were not used to build muscle bulk, but rather to improve recovery and thereby let competitors train harder and longer and with less rest. There is also a secondary stimulant effect.\nDe Mondenard argued that such was the acceptance of steroids and then of corticoids that only the cost – which he put in prices of the time as between 35,000 and 50,000 French francs – was likely to restrict use. Only the richest or the most ambitious riders could afford that. And the rewards could be high: Bernard Thévenet won the 1975 and 1977 Tour de France editions by using cortisone. \"I was doped with cortisone for three years and there were many like me\", he said. The experience had ruined his health, he said.\nSpanish rider Luis Ocaña failed tests in his last participation in the Tour de France in 1977 which was called the Tour of Doping.\nTesting took time to adapt, but in 1978 Belgian rider Jean-Luc van den Broucke failed tests for steroid use, and said:\nPollentier incident.\nRiders became adept at circumventing controls. Their advisers learned to calculate how long it would take a drug to move from blood into urine, and therefore how much time a rider could risk waiting before going to a drugs test. Sometimes, riders simply cheated, as was revealed to the world in 1978.\nThe rider was Michel Pollentier, who that year was the Belgian national champion and therefore wearing his national colours of red, yellow and black. By the end of the stage which finished on Alpe d'Huez he had taken the race lead and could change his champion's jersey for the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification.\nPollentier was called to the drugs test with José Nazabal and Antoine Gutierrez. Nazabal gave his sample but left the race that night. When Gutierrez went to provide his sample, the doctor – a man called Le Calvez spending his first day with the race – grew suspicious and tugged up his jersey, revealing a system of tubes and a bottle of urine. He then pulled down Pollentier's shorts and found him similarly equipped. Reports in the press called the supply of urine – somebody else's urine – as being in a bottle. Riders called it a \"pear\". In fact it was a condom. The tube ran from there to the riders' shorts so that pressure on the condom, held under the armpit, would give the impression of urinating.\nPollentier's manager, Fred De Bruyne, who was in the test caravan, told a news conference:\nThe doctor said that Pollentier had not actually used the tube and so the test would go ahead as normal. At 8pm, the organiser, Félix Lévitan, told the press that the UCI had ruled that Pollentier would be fined 5,000 Swiss francs and start an immediate suspension of two months. The question was obvious: if a rider was prepared to take drugs and win a stage, knowing he would be tested, how many times had the ruse been shown to work before?\nThe era of EPO (1990s – 2000s).\nWhen other drugs became detectable, riders began achieving the effects of transfusion more effectively by using erythropoietin, known as EPO, a drug to increase red-cell production in anaemia sufferers. EPO became widespread, as a flurry of exposures and confessions revealed in 2006 and 2007. \"When I saw riders with fat arses climbing cols like aeroplanes, I understood what was happening\", said the Colombian rider, Luis Herrera.\nEPO's problem for testers was that like testosterone and, before that, cortisone, they could not distinguish it from what the body produced naturally. For the first time, said Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, authorities had to settle not for the presence of a drug but its presence in unusual quantities. Testers set a haematocrit limit of 50 per cent and \"rested\" riders who exceeded it. Bjarne Riis, the Danish rider who won the Tour in 1996, was known as \"Mr 60 per cent\" among riders. On 25 May 2007, he admitted he had used EPO from 1993 to 1998, including 1996 when he won the Tour.\nCynicism set in among both riders and officials. Jacques Goddet, organiser of the Tour from 1936 to 1987, said in 1999:\nSince 1997, the Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses is the testing laboratory of the Tour de France.\n1998 Festina scandal.\nOn 8 July 1998, French Customs arrested Willy Voet, a soigneur for the Festina team, for the possession of illegal drugs, including narcotics, erythropoietin (EPO), growth hormones, testosterone, and amphetamines. Voet later described many common doping practices in his book, \"Massacre à la Chaîne\". On 23 July 1998, French police raided several teams' hotels and found drugs in the possession of the TVM team. As news spread, riders staged a sit-down strike during the 17th stage. After mediation by Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour, police agreed to limit the most heavy-handed tactics and riders agreed to continue. Many riders and teams had already abandoned the race and only 111 riders completed the stage. In a 2000 trial, it became clear that the management and health officials of Festina had organized drug-taking within the team. Richard Virenque, a top Festina rider, finally confessed after being ridiculed for maintaining that if he was doping he was somehow not consciously aware of it – as the satirical television programme, \"Les Guignols de l'Info\", put it: \"à l'insu de mon plein gré\" (\"of my own free will but without my knowing\").\nIn the years following the 1998 Festina affair, anti-doping measures were put into effect by race organizers and the UCI, including more frequent testing and new tests for blood doping transfusions and EPO use. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was also created to help governments in anti-doping.\nEvidence of drugs persisted and in 2004 came new allegations. In January, Philippe Gaumont, a rider with the Cofidis team, told investigators and the press that steroids, human growth hormone, EPO, and amphetamines were endemic to the team. In June, British cyclist David Millar, also of Cofidis, and time trial world champion, was detained by French police, his apartment searched and two used EPO syringes found. Jesús Manzano, a Spanish rider then recently dismissed by the Kelme team, told the Madrid sports newspaper \"AS\" he had been forced by his former team to take banned substances and that they had taught him to evade detection. The Kelme team itself was ultimately a casualty of the disclosures, which Manzano judged to be \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\"\nLance Armstrong.\nLance Armstrong has become a symbol for doping at the Tour de France. Suspicions arose initially over his association with Italian physician Michele Ferrari and his extraordinary achievements on the road. In 1999, Armstrong failed tests for a glucocorticosteroid hormone. Armstrong explained he had used an external cortisone ointment to treat a saddle sore and produced a prescription for it. The amount detected was below the threshold and said to be consistent with the amount used for a topical skin cream, but UCI rules required that prescriptions be shown to sports authorities in advance of use. Armstrong's former assistant, Mike Anderson, stated that Armstrong used a substance with a trade name similar to \"androstenine\". This resulted in a lawsuit against Anderson and a countersuit against Armstrong.\nIn late August 2005, one month after Lance Armstrong's seventh consecutive Tour victory, the French sports newspaper \"L'Équipe\" claimed evidence that Armstrong had used EPO in the 1999 Tour de France. The claim was based on urine samples archived by the French National Laboratory for Doping Detection (LNDD) for research. Armstrong denied using EPO and the UCI did not penalise him because of the lack of a duplicate sample. The UCI confirmed that its own doctor Mario Zorzoli leaked the 15 forms tying Armstrong to the failed tests to \"L'Équipe\".\nOn 22 October 2012, Armstrong was banned for life and stripped of all his titles since 1 August 1998, including all seven of his Tour de France victories, because an investigation by USADA concluded that he had been engaged in a massive doping scheme. He later admitted to doping in a 2013 interview with Oprah Winfrey.\nOf the cyclists who finished on the podium in the era in which Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times (1999–2005), Fernando Escartín is the sole rider not to be implicated in a doping scandal. Due to 20 of the 21 podium finishers \"directly tied to likely doping through admissions, sanctions, public investigations or exceeding the UCI hematocrit (a blood test to discover EPO use) threshold\", Escartin's third-place finish in the 1999 Tour de France stands as the lone of the 21 podium finishes that was untainted, during the years (1999–2005) in which Lance Armstrong finished the Tour de France in first place.\n2006 Tour de France.\nOperación Puerto investigation.\nIn 2006, several riders, including Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso, were barred from the eve of the race amid allegations by Spanish police as a result of their Operación Puerto investigation.\nThe Astana-Würth team could not start because, despite a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, five of its nine Tour riders were barred after being officially named in the Operacion Puerto affair. With only four riders remaining (Alexander Vinokourov, Andrey Kashechkin, Carlos Barredo and Luis León Sánchez) the team did not have the minimum number of riders demanded by the rules to enter.\nThe cyclists excluded from 2006 Tour de France were:\nFloyd Landis accusation.\nOn 27 July 2006, the Phonak team announced that Floyd Landis, winner of the 2006 Tour, failed a test after stage 17 for an abnormally high ratio of the hormone testosterone to epitestosterone. On the day the allegations were made public, Landis denied doping. Landis' personal doctor later revealed the test had found a ratio of 11:1 in Landis' blood; the permitted ratio is 4:1. On 31 July 2006, \"The New York Times\" reported that tests on Landis' sample revealed some synthetic testosterone. He was later stripped of his title and banned from cycling for two years.\n2007 Tour de France.\nThe 2007 Tour de France was dogged by controversies from the start. On 18 July, two German television companies pulled out of coverage after T-Mobile's German rider, Patrik Sinkewitz, failed a test for testosterone on 8 June at a pre-Tour training camp.\nAlessandro Petacchi, a sprint specialist, failed a test for salbutamol at Pinerolo on 23 May in the 2007 Giro d'Italia, the day of the third of his five-stage wins in the event. Petacchi, an asthma sufferer, was suspended by Milram and forced to miss the Tour de France. He was later cleared after the drug was deemed to be therapeutic use.\nOn 19 June it was revealed that the leader, Michael Rasmussen, was under suspicion for missing two out-of-competition doping tests. The Dane had been dropped by the Danish Cycling Union and his Olympic place was under review. However, with information available at the time, Rasmussen had not committed an offence under UCI rules and he remained in the yellow jersey. On 8 November Rasmussen admitted providing false information to the UCI.\nThen on 24 July it was revealed that Alexander Vinokourov had failed a test for blood doping after the time trial in Albi, which he won by more than a minute As a result, the Astana Team withdrew. Vinokourov's teammates Andreas Klöden and Andrey Kashechkin were fifth and seventh at the time. Vinokourov also failed tests for blood doping after winning Monday's stage 15.\nFollowing the Vinokourov announcement, Tour director Christian Prudhomme said professional cycling needed a \"complete overhaul\" to combat doping.\nA day later, after winning the 16th stage on the Col d'Aubisque—a victory that assured he would be the overall winner—it was alleged that Rasmussen had lied to his Rabobank team about his whereabouts on 13 and 14 June, prior to the Tour. For breaching team rules, he was removed from the race. It was later revealed that the Tour organiser, Amaury Sport Organisation, had pressed Rabobank to remove Rasmussen. On the same day, Team Cofidis pulled out following the failed test on their rider Cristian Moreni.\nThe Tour continued to be embroiled in doping controversies even after it finished. It emerged that Spanish cyclist (and 16th placed rider) Iban Mayo had failed a test for EPO on the second rest day, on 24 July. He was suspended by his team Saunier Duval–Prodir. Mayo had previously failed tests for synthetic testosterone during the 2007 Giro d'Italia, but the UCI found that he had not breached any doping regulation.\nTour winner Alberto Contador also continued to be linked to doping allegations, focussing on his relationship with Eufemiano Fuentes and his role in Operación Puerto, but without new revelations. Contador was tested in the Tour after stages 14, 17, and 18 and no discrepancies were reported. Several participants, such as Sébastien Hinault, implied that he is no better than Rasmussen.\nOn 30 July German doping expert Werner Franke accused him of having taken drugs in the past.\n2012 USADA report.\nIn October 2012, USADA released a report on the U.S. Postal Service cycling team and doping. The report contained affidavits from the following riders, each of whom described widespread use by Tour racers of banned substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO), transfused blood, and testosterone. The affidavits implicated Lance Armstrong, who was consequently banned for life and stripped of his seven Tour de France victories.\nTesting.\nAfter each stage, four riders are tested: the overall leader, the stage winner, and two riders at random. In addition, every rider is tested before the first day's stage, normally a short time-trial. Most teams are tested in their entirety at some point during the three-week race. Additional testing may take place during the off-season, and riders are expected to keep their national cycling federation informed of their whereabouts so they can be located.\nMany teams have their own drug testing programs to keep the team name clean. Teams, such as Quick-Step, have pulled riders before they compete in major competitions. Tom Boonen was pulled for cocaine before the 2008 Tour de France.\nStatus of Tour de France winners since 1961.\n14 of the 25 most recent winners (56%) have either failed tests or have confessed to have used doping. Together with those who failed tests but never sanctioned, 68% of the winners evidently used doping as detailed in the table below.\nDoping histories of Top-10 finishers, 1997–2015.\nAn overview of the top 10 finishers in the General classification in the Tour de France since 1998, along with their individual doping records.\nRiders' finishing positions are color-coded according to doping status, as explained in the legend below. Note that no distinction is made on whether a rider was doped before, during or after the particular race for which his name is listed, except if the rider was officially disqualified, such as Alberto Contador, Bernhard Kohl and Floyd Landis. Except in these circumstances, the color code for a rider is the same in all years, and does not imply or allege that the rider was doped during any particular edition of the Tour.\nLegend:"

In addition, there are some secondary classifications. The mountains classification, first calculated in 1933 and first associated with the polkadot jersey in 1975; \nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of the race in 1953, the points classification was reintroduced, having previously been the main classification from 1905 to 1912 inclusive. It rewarded the consistent finishers in individual stages by awarding points depending on the placing at the end of the stage and, from 1966 onwards, at any designated intermediate points along the route. From 1966 to 1989 inclusive, a separate classification was included solely for points awarded at these intermediate 'hot spots' or 'sprints' and from 1984 onward associated with the award of a red jersey. In 1975, the Tour organisers launched the young rider classification, replacing the 'combination' classification run since 1968 for 'overall best rider' based on points awarded from the general, mountain and points classification- although the combination classification was subsequently reintroduced from 1980 to 1989 inclusive. Eddy Merckx in 1969 is the only rider to win the King of the Mountains, the points and the overall title in the same year."

        "text": "The 2004 World Snooker Championship (officially the 2004 Embassy World Snooker Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 17 April to 3 May 2004 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, the 28th consecutive year the World Snooker Championship was held at the venue. The eighth and final ranking event of the 2003–04 snooker season, the tournament was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association and sponsored by cigarette company Embassy. The total prize fund was £1,378,920, of which the winner received £250,000.\nQualifying rounds for the tournament took place from 10 to 20 February 2004 at Pontins. The main stage of the tournament featured 32 players: the top 16 players from the snooker world rankings and another 16 players from the qualifying rounds. Ryan Day and Stephen Maguire were debutants at the Crucible. Mark Williams was the defending champion, having won the 2003 final against Ken Doherty. He lost to Joe Perry in the second round.\nRonnie O'Sullivan won his second world title by defeating Graeme Dott 18–8 in the final, despite having trailed Dott 0–5. This was the fourth biggest margin in a World final, subsequently equalled by O'Sullivan against Ali Carter in 2008, and Kyren Wilson in 2020.\nOverview.\nThe first World Snooker Championship final took place in 1927 at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England, and was won by Joe Davis. Since 1977 the tournament has been held annually at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The 2004 event marked the 28th consecutive year that the tournament was held at the Crucible, and the 36th successive year that the World Championship was contested through the modern knockout format. Scottish player Stephen Hendry had been the most successful participant at the World Championship in the modern era, having won the title seven times. Welsh player Mark Williams won his second world title at the 2003 championship, defeating Irish player Ken Doherty 18–16 in the final, for which he received a £270,000 top prize from a total prize fund of £1,682,900. Organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the 2004 tournament was sponsored by cigarette company Embassy, which sponsored the event from 1976 to 2005.\nFormat.\nThe 2004 World Snooker Championship took place from 17 April to 3 May 2004, as the last of eight ranking events in the 2003–04 snooker season. The event featured a 32-player main draw, preceded by a qualifying tournament that was held at Pontins between 10 and 20 February 2004. The qualifiers were played over six rounds, higher-ranked players being seeded and given byes to the later rounds. All of the rounds were played as the best of 19 .\nThe top 16 players in the latest snooker world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. Defending champion Williams was automatically seeded first overall. The remaining 15 seeds were allocated based on the latest world rankings. Matches in the first round of the main draw were played as the best of 19 frames, second-round matches and quarter-finals played as the best of 25 frames, and the semi-finals as the best of 33 frames. The final was played over two days as a best-of-35-frames match. Reaching the first round of the tournament's main stage were 17 players from England, six from Scotland, five from Wales, and one each from Ireland, Thailand, Australia and Northern Ireland.\nPrize fund.\nThe winner of the event received £250,000 from a total fund of £1,378,920. The breakdown of prize money is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nMain stage.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played between 17 and 22 April as the best of 19 frames. Williams faced Dominic Dale. The defending champion, who became a father the day before the match was played, earned a 6–3 lead in the first , with five over 50, including a of 105 in the second frame. Coming back for the second and final session, Dale responded and won three consecutive frames to draw level at 7–7. Williams, however, did the same and clinched victory with the last three frames, which included a . \"It's not the best preparation you can have, but if you're happy off the table you can carry that over,\" commented the two-time world champion after the match with regard to his fatherhood.\nSix seeded players – Stephen Lee, Quinten Hann, Steve Davis, Peter Ebdon, Ken Doherty and Jimmy White – lost in the first round. Although Lee fell 3–6 behind Lee Walker, he managed to win three of the first four frames of the evening session to reduce the gap to a single one. Walker, nonetheless, clinched the twelfth frame, which lasted 53 minutes, and ended up winning the match 10–7. Lee claimed afterwards that the defeat was the summary of \"a terrible season\" for him. Andy Hicks advanced into the second round by beating Hann 4–10. Having already been warned for his language by referee Lawrie Annandale in the eleventh frame, he confronted his rival once the match had ended and he admitted to having told him \"You're short, bald and always will be, and can have me outside whenever you want\". Hicks pointed out to him that he was likely to drop out of the top 16 as a result of the loss. Six-time champion Davis lost to Anthony Hamilton 7–10. Doherty, 1997 winner, was beaten by two-time semi-finalist Joe Swail 6–10. Doherty's defeat was the first time he had lost in round one since 1995, and had since been champion once, finalist twice and three times a quarter-finalist. Ebdon played Ian McCulloch, who was making his third-ever appearance at the Crucible, having previously qualified for the 1999 and 2003 events. The first session, which featured a 48-minutes-long frame, was shared at 4–4, and the balance was not broken after eight more frames, with a scoreboard of 8–8. McCulloch, whose and were praised by his rival, went on to win two frames on the trot and sealed the first Crucible victory in his career. In qualifying for this event, Barry Pinches, who had made his debut at the Crucible in 1991, set the record for the biggest gap between the first two Crucible appearances. He faced White – recent European Open runner-up and Players Championship winner – in a match which overran and had to be completed after other matches. A 10–8 victory meant that Pinches would be amongst the last 16 standing for the first time in his career.\nRyan Day and Stephen Maguire were the only debutants at the Crucible this year, and both lost in round one. Day, who became the first ever player to make three centuries on his debut at the World Championship, put himself 9–7 ahead with breaks of 111, 68, 54, 128, 60, 112, 71 and 57, but 1998 champion John Higgins forced a with a 68 and took it with a result of 68–50. Maguire, who was 23 and the youngest of the 32 players who made it to this stage of the tournament, reached the main draw after a season in which he had won his first ranking tournament defeating White in the European Open final, and had also been runner-up of the British Open and champion of the UK Championship, with a 10–1 victory against David Gray. Facing 2001 champion Ronnie O'Sullivan in the first round, he had a chance to take a 4–2 lead, but he would end up losing 6–10 in a match that featured a combined three centuries by both players. O'Sullivan conceded a frame while he could still mathematically win it and also made some obscene gestures throughout the match. Chris Small was 1–7 down to fellow Scotsman Alan McManus when he was forced to retire from the match due to pain from a degenerative spinal disease, a condition which would later force him to retire from the game permanently. McManus said after the match that he was \"dumbstruck\" by his rival pulling out. Ali Carter, taking part in his second consecutive first-round match of the World Championship after having made his debut the previous season, faced David Gray, who overcame a \"nightmare start\" and made two consecutive half-centuries in the last two frames to secure victory with a result of 10–7.\nJoe Perry and Robert Milkins, who were playing in the main stage for the fourth and third time respectively, faced each other. Although Perry came out 6–3 on top at the end of the first session, Milkins reduced the deficit to two frames. Perry managed then to secure three scrappy frames on the spin to put himself one away from victory at 9–4. Milkins, however, replied with breaks of up to 51 and 65, and Perry said he was beginning to \"worry\" when it got to 9–7, but managed to close out the match. In a tactical match, Matthew Stevens, finalist in 2000, overcame a two-frame deficit against Thai player James Wattana and won the last five frames to advance into the second round. Paul Hunter, who had lost the Players Championship final against White two weeks earlier, took a 5–4 lead against 1991 world champion John Parrott, who could have levelled the match at 7 each, but missed a . Seven-time champion Stephen Hendry raced into an 8–1 lead against Stuart Pettman in the first session, and wrapped up the match with two more frames once the match was resumed, with a 117 century. In a match that only featured six breaks over fifty, Graeme Dott defeated Mark King in the decider. \"It was actually getting embarrassing how bad the game was\", he said afterwards.\nSecond round.\nThe second round of the event was played as the best of 25 frames, held over three sessions, between 22 and 26 April. Pinches, playing in this stage of the tournament for the first time, led Hendry 11–9 before losing 12–13. Hendry regarded the match as one of the toughest \"battles\" he had had to endure at the Crucible. Hunter and Stevens met in the last 16 for the second consecutive year. Stevens avenged his 6–13 defeat the previous year, coming from behind in the final frames to win a close match. Hunter found himself two frames in front with only three to play at 12–10 before missing a in the 23rd frame which would have given him the match. Stevens took all three frames to win the match 13–12. Perry ousted defending champion Williams and made a break of 145, which would remain as the highest break of the tournament. Having manufactured a 10–6 lead, Perry lost five frames on the trot and let Williams in front for the first time in the match at 10–11. Perry put together breaks of 55, 53 and 82 to secure victory and advance into the quarter-finals of the World Championship for the first time in his career. The most one-sided match of the second round featured Walker and Gray, who took victory with a result of 13–5 and would also make his first appearance in the quarter-finals. \"It was not my greatest performance\", he highlighted despite the result and urged himself to score more heavily the next day.\nDott got off to a good start in his match against Higgins and established a 5–1 advantage that got reduced to 6–3 by the end of the first session. Going into the last session, Dott managed to put himself 12–7 up at one point, but Higgins fired back with breaks of 89 and 130 and won another one to reduce the deficit to only a couple of frames. Dott won the match with a 62 break, and said he had \"never seen John play as badly as that\". O'Sullivan faced 1995 semi-finalist Hicks, who had not managed to get past the first round of the event since that year. Scores were level going into the final session, but O'Sullivan managed to win a duel in which he compiled five century breaks. Both players conceded frames while the rival was still at the table. Hamilton, who was eyeing his third appearance in the quarter-finals after a year in which he had not managed to qualify for the Crucible, shared the first two sessions with Swail and went into the final one tied at 8–8. Swail had until that point scored half-centuries for every frame that had gone his way, but could not hold Hamilton, who sealed victory by 13–11 with breaks of 86 and 61. McManus won the first frame against McCulloch, who then took seven in a row with breaks of 106, 64, 76, 62, 113, 82 and 84, and moved within two of victory ahead of the evening session. He only needed to play three frames of that last session to wrap up the win and earn a place in the quarter-finals for the first time in his career.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played as the best of 25 frames, held over three sessions, on 27 and 28 April. In his match against O'Sullivan, Hamilton came from 0–2 down to level at 2–2, but eventually lost the match by 3–13. It was O'Sullivan's second consecutive win with a , having compiled centuries of 109, 106, 131 and 121 in the match, and was regarded by Clive Everton writing for \"The Guardian\" as a \"performance of stunning virtuosity\". Hendry edged out McCulloch also with a 13–3 result and a session to spare. In setting up a semi-final duel with O'Sullivan, he made two centuries and nine half-centuries.\nPerry, contesting his first ever quarter-final, was six frames behind Stevens at the beginning of the last session at 5–11, but managed to pull back to 10–12 and said he felt he could win it. He stated, however, he was \"mentally tired\" after his second-round match against Williams and that he had lost the match \"at the start\". \"It's difficult when you have a big lead like that and then someone fights back, because it really puts the pressure on you\", pointed out Stevens. Dott had never reached this stage of the tournament before either, and displayed what he thought was \"a rubbish game\", but defeated Gray 13–7, closing out the match with a break of 62. \"You watch the Crucible when it gets to one table as a kid, and wonder what it would be like to play there\", he said afterwards.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played as the best of 33 frames, held over four sessions, between 29 April and 1 May. Several breaks of over eighty and ninety points and a 117 century gave O'Sullivan a clear advantage over Hendry in the two first sessions, which meant that at the end of the second one, he was 13–3 ahead. The match ended 17–4 and with a session to spare, thanks to breaks of 93 and 79 by O'Sullivan, whose victory against Hendry was the biggest ever for a semi-final of the tournament, improving Hendry's 16–4 win over Terry Griffiths in 1992.\nIn the other semi-final Dott faced Stevens, who had already reached this stage of the tournament on four occasions. The Scotsman displayed good safety throughout the match and although Stevens won frames 28, 29 and 30 to move one away from victory, Dott then forced a decider, which he won on the final pink ball.\nFinal.\nThe final of the event was played on 2 and 3 May as a best-of-35-frames match, held over four sessions, between Dott and O'Sullivan. Welsh referee Paul Collier took charge of his first World Championship final. O'Sullivan (seeded third) was contesting his second World Championship final, having won his previous one in 2001 against Higgins, while it was the first one for Dott (seeded thirteenth), who had till that point reached two ranking finals – those of the 1999 Scottish Open and the 2001 British Open – but had come short to both Hendry and Higgins. Dott made a strong start to the match and compiled breaks of 71, 77, 64 and 60 to move 5–0 clear, but O'Sullivan responded with a 100-point century break and then won three more to put himself only one away from his rival at the end of the first session. In the second session, played over the afternoon, O'Sullivan won all frames save one – in which Dott compiled a 106 century – and only needed two frames and twenty minutes in the evening to seal his second world title.\nO'Sullivan won the match 18–8, the biggest margin in a World final since Hendry's 18–5 victory over White in 1993 and the fourth largest in the history of the tournament, subsequently equalled by himself against Carter in 2008, and Kyren Wilson in 2020. Afterwards, Dott conceded that the newly crowned champion could be regarded as \"the greatest of all time\" and expressed elation over having avoided losing the final with a session to spare. \"It could have been worse\", he stated in the post-match interview.

        "title": "Dixie Classic (basketball tournament)",
        "text": "The Dixie Classic was an annual college basketball tournament played from 1949 to 1960 in Reynolds Coliseum. The field consisted of the \"Big Four\" North Carolina schools, the host NC State Wolfpack, Duke Blue Devils, North Carolina Tar Heels, and Wake Forest Demon Deacons, and four teams from across the country.\nNorth Carolina State head coach Everett Case originated the idea of the Classic. His assistant, Carl \"Butter\" Anderson provided the name. The tournament was played over a three-day period every December, just after Christmas, on North Carolina State's home court.\nThe Classic consisted of three rounds. In the first round the four North Carolina schools would each play a visiting team. The winners of the first-round game would advance in the winners' bracket and the losers would advance in the losers' bracket. Each day would have four games played until the third and final day when a champion would be crowned. No team from outside North Carolina ever won the Classic.\nThe tournament came to an end after a point-shaving scandal in 1961 involving players from both North Carolina State and North Carolina. The Big Four schools later participated in the Big Four Tournament from 1971 to 1981.\nBackground and founding.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, NC State had been outperformed by Duke and North Carolina in football. The school made a decision to improve their basketball program because it was cheaper to do so. Their first move was to build a new, larger basketball venue to replace Thompson Gym. Construction started in 1941, but the United States' involvement in World War II forced the construction's cessation. NC State's then athletic council H. A. Fisher sought advice on who to hire to coach NC State from Chuck Taylor, who stated: \"The best basketball coach in the country is a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy. His name is Everett Case.\" Famed Indiana high school coach Case was hired after the war ended and first demanded they redesign their in construction arena. Case wanted the venue to be very large, larger than the recently constructed Duke Indoor Stadium. As the arena had a steel frame already built, to increase capacity, they extended the building to have larger end zones behind the baskets. The 12,400 seat building was completed in 1949 and officially called William Neal Reynolds Coliseum.\nAs the coliseum was being finished, football in the state was immensely successful with Duke Blue Devils football coach Wallace Wade leading the Blue Devils to success, multi–position Charlie Justice at North Carolina, and Wake Forest coach Peahead Walker leading the team to bowl games. Football's regular season in 1949 came to an end on November 19, when the Tar Heels played the Blue Devils in front of a state record crowd of 57,500. Weeks later, Case had planned for a basketball tournament to be held at Reynolds Coliseum across three days, with eight participants. The tournament was a joint idea between Case and \"The News and Observer\" writer Dick Herbert. The tournament was to be called the Dixie Classic, a name created by his assistant coach Carl \"Butter\" Anderson. Case desired to create the Christmas holiday tournament as he felt North Carolina was ignored in national sports coverage. The tournament would feature each of the four schools referred to as the Big Four or Tobacco Road: Duke University, North Carolina State College, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Wake Forest College. The remaining four entrants would be various talented teams from across the nation. Often the invited schools would be asked close to one or two years before the year of the tournament in question. In advance of the first edition, \"The News and Observer\" speculated that the event would increase statewide interest in basketball, along with showing how other areas teams play the sport.\nHistory.\nThe first edition of the Dixie Classic brought Georgia Tech, Penn State, Rhode Island State College, and West Virginia, along with the Big Four.\nPoint–shaving scandal.\nAs early as 1959, there were allegations of point shaving, but there was no evidence found. In 1961, an operation was discovered involving the tournament that could be traced back to gambling in New York City. On May 14, 1961, University of North Carolina system President William C. Friday was called to an emergency meeting in Chapel Hill, North Carolina with Wake County's district solicitor Lester Chalmers. At the meeting, it was disclosed that at least four NC State players and maybe two North Carolina players were involved in fixing the matches, one game which for sure happened at the Dixie Classic. During the meeting, it was revealed that a gambler had pulled a gun on an NC State player when the fix did not go as planned. At the behest of President Friday and chancellors from both NC State and North Carolina, the Dixie Classic was cancelled after twelve years. In addition, sanctions were placed on the NC State and North Carolina basketball programs. The two teams also had reduced schedules for the 1961–62 seasons where they could play the fourteen conference games, but only two non–conference games instead of the standard nine. Other penalties included the prevention of players participating in summer basketball leagues and limiting the number of recruits from outside the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) territory to two. By 1962, the point shaving scandal could be traced through 50 players at 25 different schools involving at least 54 games. Four Wolfpack players and one Tar Heel were charged with bribery and then granted immunity in the Wake County Superior Court because they testified against the conspirators. In Durham County, the same players were tried and convicted, but given suspended sentences. Of the eight conspirators who paid players, six pleaded guilty in North Carolina to bribery and conspiracy before serving prison sentences, while two went to trial and were found guilty.\nAftermath.\nThe event had such an impact that people put tickets to the Dixie Classic into their will. Friday stated that \"There was no Final Four in those days. It was our Final Four. There was enormous pressure on the thing from top to bottom.\" When interviewed close to 50 years later, Friday stated that the gun being pulled on a player still bothered him."

Krause signed Robinson to a 5-year, US$30 million contract in 2001. In 2004, John Paxson, who replaced Krause as Bulls' general manager in 2003, convinced Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf to buy out the last two years of Robinson's contract.

        "text": "Australia has competed in swimming at the Summer Olympics since the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, after only sending a runner, Edwin Flack, to the 1896 Summer Olympics. Frederick Lane was Australia's sole swimming representative at the 1900 Games, winning two individual gold medals. Women's events were added at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm; Fanny Durack and Mina Wylie, Australia's first female representatives, won gold and silver in the 100-metre freestyle, which was the first women's event on the program. At the 1908 Summer Olympics and the 1912 Summer Olympics, Australia competed as Australasia, sending a combined team with New Zealand. The table includes Malcolm Champion, a New Zealander who was part of the 4×200-metre freestyle relay team that captured gold in 1912.\nAustralia has won a total of 71 gold medals in the sport, second only to the United States, who have won 257. East Germany is in third place with 38 golds, although this is widely attributed to state-sponsored systematic doping programs.\nSwimming is Australia's most prolific Olympic sport, having been responsible for 71 of Australia's 167 Olympic gold medals. In addition, a list of the top 100 Australian Olympians of all time, compiled by the Australian Olympic Committee, named 35 swimmers in the top 100, more than any other sport. Swimmers have been given the honour of carrying the Australian flag six times in twelve at the closing ceremony, which is traditionally reserved for the most successful athlete of the delegation.\nAustralia's strongest-ever performance in swimming was at the 1956 Olympics on home soil in Melbourne. Australia claimed eight of the thirteen gold medals available, including both relays and a clean sweep of the medals in the 100-metre freestyle, considered the blue-riband event for both men and women. This is the only time that Australia has topped the medal tally in swimming, and the tally of gold medals was not surpassed until Australia won 9 at the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, when the swimming program had expanded to its current 35 events.\nAustralia has been most successful in the freestyle discipline, with 37 of the 58 golds coming in the stroke. Eight of the gold have come from the men's 1500-metre freestyle, the most victories in the event by any country, which has resulted in the event being dubbed \"Australia's race\" by Australian commentators. Australia's first medal outside of freestyle did not come until 1932 when Clare Dennis and Bonnie Mealing won gold and silver in the 200-metre breaststroke and 100-metre backstroke respectively. It was not until John Davies' victory in the 200-metre breaststroke in 1952 that a male swimmer had won a medal outside of freestyle. Backstroke is Australia's weakest discipline, with David Theile's two consecutive golds in the 100-metre backstroke being the only victories in the discipline until Kaylee McKeown's double golds in Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics.\nIndividual medallists.\nThe following table includes only medals won by Australian swimmers in individual events.\nAll medallists.\nThe following table includes all those who have won medals, including as part of relay teams. Since 1984, swimmers who participated in the preliminary heats but not in the final were awarded medals if the final team went on to claim a medal, whereas those prior to 1984 did not. Those who swam in the heats only are marked with an asterisk, multiple times if multiple medals were awarded for swimming in heats only. Malcolm Champion, a member of the 4×200-metre freestyle relay team in 1912, was a New Zealander, competing as part of the combined Australasia team. His teammates in the combined relay team were Cecil Healy, Les Boardman, and Harold Hardwick."

        "text": "Rugby World Cup qualification is a process that determines which nations will compete at the Rugby World Cup, a men's rugby union competition.\nUnlike previous tournaments (where eight teams, the quarter-finalists from the preceding World Cup, qualified automatically and twelve places were available through qualification) the 2011 World Cup would be the first to be contested by twelve automatic qualifiers / seeds (the teams who finished in the top three of the groups at the 2007 World Cup) and eight qualifiers; this format has been retained for future tournaments.\nThe qualification system for the remaining eight places will be region-based with Europe and the Americas allocated two qualifying places, Africa, Asia and Oceania one place each, with the last place determined by a play-off.\nHistory.\nThe first Rugby World Cup, the tournament of 1987 held no qualifying tournament. Instead, all the then members of the International Rugby Board (then, IFRB) were automatically included in the competition. These members accounted for seven of the 16 available positions. The remaining positions were filled by invitation.\nThe next tournament, the 1991 Rugby World Cup implemented a qualifying process. Eight of the 16 available positions were filled by nations automatically, however, the remaining positions would be determined by a 25 nation qualifying tournament. The following tournament, the 1995 Rugby World Cup, increased the qualifying tournament to 43 nations. In addition to the eight previous quarterfinalists, hosts South Africa were granted automatic entry.\nThe approach changed again for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, as only the hosts and the defending champions, the runners-up, the third place play-off winners from the 1995 cup were to gain automatic entry, as opposed to the elite eight nations. The 1999 world cup also saw the introduction of a repechage, a second chance for teams that had finished runners-up in each qualifying zone. Again, the number of nations participating in the qualifying events increased, from 43 to 63.\n81 teams entered qualifying for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. The eight quarter-finalists from the previous world cup gained automatic qualification with another twelve berths open to qualifiers. Teams from five continents, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe and the Americas gained entry to the competition. Qualification came through a mixture of round robin tournaments, knockout and repechage.\nA similar mixture of round robin tournaments, knockout and repechage was used for the qualification for the 2007 Rugby World Cup involving 86 teams, which together with the 8 teams which have qualified automatically brought to 94 the total number of teams participating in the 2007 tournament.\nIn addition to the eight quarterfinalists at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, the four teams finishing in third place in their respective pools qualified automatically for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Various existing regional tournaments were incorporated into the qualification process for the remaining eight berths. Including teams that failed to qualify for official qualifying tournaments, 88 teams participated in the qualification process, bringing the total number of teams participating in the 2011 tournament to 100.\nFirst appearance in qualification by team.\nTeams marked in italics had appeared in a previous world cup (by invitation in 1987 and automatically thereafter). France, New Zealand, and South Africa have never needed to take part in the qualifying tournaments, having been invited to their first tournament and always qualifying automatically thereafter.\nRepechage results.\nThe repechage, a second chance for teams that had finished runners-up in each qualifying zone, has been a feature of qualifying since it was introduced during qualifying for the 1999 Rugby World Cup. The following table shows which teams have participated in the repechage – both the teams that have qualified via the repechage, and the teams that have failed to qualify via the repechage.\nNote: All scores marked with an asterisk (*) are aggregate scores over two legs.\n2011 qualifying format.\nAutomatic qualification.\nUnlike recent tournaments (where all eight quarter-finalists from the previous tournament automatically qualified for the subsequent world cup) automatic qualification for the 2011 World Cup was awarded to the twelve teams which finished in the top three of each of the 2007 World Cup groups (pools).\nQualification for 2011.\nSeven of the eight qualifying berths were given out as follows: two berths each for Europe and Americas and one each for Asia, Africa and Oceania. The final spot was determined by the winner of a playoff, that included the third place teams from the American and European qualifying tournaments and the second place teams from the African and Asian qualifying tournaments."

        "title": "Singapore national cricket team",
        "text": "The Singapore national cricket team is the team that represents Singapore in international cricket. Singapore has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1974, and was a founding member of the Asian Cricket Council formed in 1983.\nThe Singapore Cricket Club was established in 1837 during the colonial period. Singapore played regular fixtures against other British colonies in Asia beginning in the late 19th century, notably participating in the interport matches. It later contributed players to combined teams representing the Straits Settlements and Malaya. After gaining ICC membership, Singapore played in six out of the first seven editions of the ICC Trophy, beginning in 1979. Post-independence, its greatest rivalry is with neighbouring Malaysia, in the annual Stan Nagaiah Trophy. Singapore reached as high as Division Three of the World Cricket League. The team made its Twenty20 International debut in 2019, following the granting of that status to associate members of the ICC, and in the same year participated in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier for the first time.\nHistory.\nBeginnings of cricket in Singapore.\nThe first recorded mention of cricket in Singapore was in 1837 when a \"Mr Z\" complained, in a letter to the Singapore Free Press, of cricket being played near a church on a Sunday in violation of the Christian Sabbath. This resulted in cricket being banned on Sundays, a prohibition that remained in place until the 1930s.\nCricket was an important recreational activity, with matches often played against the officers of visiting ships. The Singapore Cricket Club was formed in 1852 and played its first match amongst themselves the same year. The quality of cricket in these early years was quite poor, and it wasn't until 1865 before a team total of more than 100 was scored. Louis Glass became the first person in Singapore to record a century two years later.\nThe Singapore Cricket Club eventually began to play against teams from other parts of British Malaya such as Penang, Perak and Kuala Lumpur and this eventually led to an invitation from Hong Kong to send a team there, which saw the beginning of the long-running series of \"Interport matches\".\nStraits Settlements cricket team.\nThe 1890 invitation from Hong Kong led to the formation of the Straits Settlements cricket team, and they played Hong Kong in two two-day matches, both of which were lost. The series was the beginning of the \"Interport Matches\", which continued until 1987. Hong Kong and Ceylon came to Singapore the following year, and the Straits Settlements won both matches, also drawing against a combined Ceylon/Hong Kong team.\nThe Straits Settlements team beat Ceylon in Colombo in 1893, and played a match in Jakarta in 1895. Matches against the Federated Malay States began in 1896, and against Shanghai in 1897.\nThey played Burma in 1906, and their involvement in the Interport Matches ceased in 1909, when they were replaced by an All Malaya team. The Straits Settlements visited Bangkok in 1910, though from them their only matches came annually against the Federated Malay States until 1940. These fixtures continue in the modern era as the Saudara Cup matches between Singapore and Malaysia.\nSingapore team.\nFirst matches.\nThe Singapore team did play twice during the Straits Settlements team era, playing twice against WAS Oldfield's XI in 1927, losing both matches by an innings. They next played in 1957, drawing at home to Ceylon. Various teams visited Singapore in the 1960s, including Worcestershire.\nThe Interport Matches resumed in 1968 with Singapore drawing against Hong Kong. These matches were played occasionally until 1987. In 1970, the Saudara Cup match against Malaysia was played for the first time, this continues annually to the present day. Also that year, Singapore played an MCC side captain by Tony Lewis and featuring Geoff Boycott. The match was won by the MCC.\nICC membership.\nSingapore became an associate member of the ICC in 1974 and three years later won the Saudara Cup for the first time. In 1978, Singapore played India at home, the match ending in a draw. Singapore took part in the first ICC Trophy in England in 1979 but could only finish fourth in their first round group after only beating Argentina. They finished fourth out of eight teams in their first round group in the 1982 tournament and withdrew from the 1986 tournament when several of their players couldn't get leave from work.\nSingapore played in the South East Asian Tournament for the first time in 1984, playing in the event again in 1988 and 1992 (when they hosted), though they never reached the final as Bangladesh and Hong Kong finished first and second on each occasion. The final Interport Match took place in Singapore in 1987, with Hong Kong beating the home side. They returned to the ICC Trophy for the 1990 tournament in the Netherlands, beating Malaysia and Israel during the event, and failing to progress past the first round.\nSingapore began playing in the Tuanku Ja'afar Cup in 1991, an annual tournament against Malaysia, Hong Kong and Thailand. They won the event just once, in 1994, a year in which they finished 19th out of 20 teams in the ICC Trophy. The Stan Nagaiah Trophy, an annual three match series of one-day matches against Malaysia, began the following year. Singapore played in the first ACC Trophy in 1996, beating the Maldives and Thailand but failing to go past the first round. They finished 14th in the 1997 ICC Trophy and could only beat Papua New Guinea in the 1998 ACC Trophy, again failing to go past the first round.\n21st century.\n2000 - 2017.\nThe first two major tournaments of the 21st century for Singapore got them off to a bad start as they lost all their first round matches in both the 2000 ACC Trophy in the UAE and the 2001 ICC Trophy in Ontario, their final ICC Trophy to date. They hosted the ACC Trophy in 2002, beating the Maldives and Thailand (by 325 runs) but again failing to progress beyond the first round, a performance they repeated in 2004. The finished fourth in the ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament in 2004 and 2005.\nSingapore began to show an improvement in their form in 2006. That year they finished third in the ACC Premier League and finally passed the first round stage in the ACC Trophy, finishing fifth to qualify for Division Five of the World Cricket League in 2008. They didn't progress beyond the first round of the 2007 ACC Twenty20 Cup, beating only Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia, but captain Chaminda Ruwan did make the highest score of the tournament. In the World Cricket League Division Five tournament in Jersey, Singapore finished fifth after beating Botswana in a play-off, though they did beat Afghanistan during the first round, who went on to win the tournament.\nIn August 2009, Singapore hosted and won Division Six of the World Cricket League, going through the tournament undefeated and winning promotion back to Division Five. In November 2009, Singapore travelled to the UAE for the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup. During the tournament Singapore finished third in Group A, therefore failing to progress to the semi-finals and a chance to qualify for the 2010 Asian Games. In the fifth place playoff Singapore lost to Nepal by 9 wickets to finish to tournament in sixth place.\nIn the 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Five, they finished fourth to remain in Division Five. Hosting the 2012 tournament, they ran out winners, moving them up to Division Four and keeping their hopes of World Cup qualification alive. Singapore has decided to dedicate their strengths in to their SEA GAMES team, where Mohammad Yusof Bin Aslam (Captain) has chosen not to participate due to conflict of interest.\nIn August 2017, Singapore won two medals in cricket at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. They won the gold medal in the 20-over tournament and the silver medal in the 50-over tournament. On 26 April 2018, ICC released in a press conference that all the men's T20 matches will get T20I status starting from 1 January 2019.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Singapore and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.\nSingapore played their first T20I against Qatar on 22 July 2019.\nOn 28 July 2019, after their victory against Nepal in the regional finals of the 2018–19 ICC T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier; Singapore qualified for the ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier for the first time.\nAfter April 2019, Singapore will play in the 2019–21 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League.\nIn September 2019, Singapore beat Zimbabwe by four runs in the third T20I match of the 2019–20 Singapore Tri-Nation Series.

He played in the full back position.\nBackground.\nReilly was born in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England.\nCareer.\nReilly was not interested in rugby league as a child and only watched a few Huddersfield matches until a friend at school encouraged him to play for a local amateur side. Paul started playing for Moldgreen Under-14s and discovered a real talent for the game.\nHe was playing well at Moldgreen and as a result he attended trials at Halifax Blue Sox. They offered him a contract for 1997's Super League III, but as the 1996 season was only halfway through he was training at the Huddersfield Giants, after four or five weeks the then coach of the Huddersfield Giants, Darryl van der Velde had seen enough and offered him a deal. In 2001, he spent a month on loan at Batley Bulldogs.\nReilly established himself as the first choice at Huddersfield Giants, and he was a stand-out player in both the successful 2002 Northern Ford Premiership campaign and then later in the Super League, where his passionate, whole-hearted performances were a key factor in the Huddersfield Giants establishing themselves as a competitive club.\nHe played twice for England in the 2004 European Nations Cup, including a man of the match performance in the final against Ireland, in which he scored two tries in the first seventeen minutes.\nHe featured for his home town team in the 2006 Challenge Cup Final, where he performed a memorable try-saving tackle on Ade Gardner to keep his side in the game in the first half.\nTowards the end of 2006 Reilly released a testimonial booklet entitled \"The Life of Reilly\" which celebrated his 10-years with the Huddersfield Giants and featured contributions from many past players and coaching staff. Reilly had a joint testimonial match with Keith Senior of the Leeds Rhinos at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Friday 26 January 2007.\nReilly announced at the start of 2007's Super League XII that he had signed a one-year extension to his contract and intended to retire at the end of the season after 11 years with his hometown club. He scored 8 tries in the season and helped to steer the Huddersfield Giants to a memorable 5th-placed finish in Super League. It was announced in August 2007 that the Huddersfield Giants would not be renewing Reilly's contract, respecting his wish to retire, and he was proudly carried off the field by team-mates following the club's 16-22 play-off defeat by Hull F.C. at the end of 2007's Super League XII .\nDespite intending to retire, Reilly was offered a lucrative contract by Wakefield Trinity Wildcats in September 2007 and signed for the club. However, after only four appearances it was revealed that he had sustained a serious neck injury and it seemed likely he would never play again.\nHowever, he overcame this injury and played for Oldham in the Co-operative Championship 1."

        "text": "Sacred Heart Church is a Roman Catholic church and parish in Wimbledon, South West London initially run by the Jesuits, that serves the Catholic community of Wimbledon and surrounding areas. It is in the Archdiocese of Southwark and is situated next to Wimbledon College and Donhead Preparatory School. The main entrance to the church is on Edge Hill road, but the church can also be accessed from the adjacent Darlaston Road.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nThe church was founded by Edith Arendrup, a member of the wealthy Courtauld family who came to live in Wimbledon in 1877. At the time, there were few Catholics in the area, so she convinced the Jesuits at Roehampton to start a Mass-centre at her house in Cottenham Park. Seven years later, she commissioned the construction of a large church in a prominent position on the slopes of Edge Hill. The Grade II* listed building was designed by Frederick Walters, a young architect, who designed it in the late Decorated Gothic style.\nConstruction.\nThe nave of the newly built church opened on 17 June, the feast of the Sacred Heart, in 1887. Construction continued for fourteen years while the rest of the building was completed: first the sanctuary and south aisle in 1895, then the back chapels in 1896, the north aisle and sacristy in 1898, and finally the west front in 1901. The original plan called for a large tower on the west front, but money ran out and it was replaced by twin turrets and a massive, traceried window. A monument on the south wall of the church dedicated to Edith Arendrup is inscribed with the words: “It was through her Christian vision that this parish of the Sacred Heart came into being; it was through her generosity the church was built.”\nFrom 1898, the church had a new benefactor, Caroline Currie of Coombe Hill. She was the wealthy widow of the banker Bertram Wodehouse Currie, and paid for the north aisle, along with a chapel dedicated to the founder of the Jesuits, St. Ignatius, and the baptistery. The St. Ignatius chapel contains a medallion of Mrs. Currie who died in 1902.\nIn 1905, another church was built within the parish by the Jesuits, St Winefride Church. It was built to accommodate the congregation in South Wimbledon. In 1913, again the parish needed to expand and a Mass centre was set up in Wimbledon Park. In 1926, a church was built in the area by the Jesuits which became Christ the King Church and was finished in 1928.\n20th century.\nIn 1990 the church was re-ordered. A new high altar was installed, designed by David John who was also responsible for the bronze reliquary underneath containing relics of Roman and English martyrs, including Saints Thomas More and Saint Edmund Campion. The tiled floor was designed by Austin Winkley. The altar was dedicated by Bishop Tripp, an Auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Southwark, at a special ceremony on the feast of the Sacred Heart, 22 June 1990.\n21st century.\nIn 2007 and 2008 the church halls were refurbished, access improved and a new youth room added. On 17 November 2012, it was announced that the Jesuits would no longer be involved in the direct administration of the church after serving the parish for over 130 years. On 10 January 2014, it was handed over to the Archdiocese of Southwark who continue to administer the parish.\nParish.\nThe church is next door to Wimbledon College and Donhead School for boys (both of these schools are served by the Jesuits) and the Ursuline High School and Ursuline Preparatory School for girls (served by the Ursulines), which all enjoy a close relationship with the parish. The schools use the church for various masses throughout the school year.\nThe parish hosts many groups within its parish centre. It has a local Christian Life Community association which ministers to the spiritual needs of the parish, by garnering interest in Ignatian spirituality. Also, it has a social justice group which promotes fair trade products and raises awareness of social issues.\nJesuit Missions.\n\"Jesuit Missions\" is a development and mission-based charity of the Society of Jesus in Britain. It remains on the same street as the church after the Jesuits handed the parish over to the archdiocese. In 1961, it moved from Roehampton to Wimbledon and was led by Tony Montfort for 40 years. It organises fundraising initiatives, such as through the London Marathon, and distributes the money to developing countries. It distributes news about the activities of overseas Jesuits and other missionaries, such as the imprisonment of Stan Swamy, and the murders of La Salle laybrother Paul McAuley in Peru, and Fr Victor-Luke Odhiambo in Kenya. It with other charities and networks such as Global First Responder, Educate Magis, the Xavier Network, Justice in Mining group and within the Global Ignatian Advocacy Network."

        "title": "Split (bowling)",
        "text": "A split is a situation in ten pin bowling in which the first ball of a frame knocks down the headpin (\"number 1 bowling pin\") but leaves standing two or more non-adjacent groups of one or more pins. Scoring a spare in this situation is often referred to as a \"killer shot\".\nTypes.\n7–10 split.\nOne of the most infamous of splits is the 7–10 split, often called \"goal posts\", \"bedposts\", or \"snake eyes\", where the bowler is left with the leftmost and the rightmost pin in the back row (the \"number 7\" and \"number 10\") to knock down with a single ball to achieve a spare. This is also one of the most difficult splits to pick up.\nThere are three ways to convert this split. The first is to strike either pin and have it bounce out of the pit area and strike the remaining pin. This not only requires substantial ball speed but the pin must be struck in the right spot. Additionally, a pin flying out from the pit is a fairly rare occurrence. This is made more difficult by variation of the pit design according to the pinsetter system, with the Brunswick A-2 being more prone to bounce-outs than recent machines. Bouncing out on a Brunswick GS-series pinsetter is exceedingly difficult due to a moving curtain at the back of the pit which absorbs the impact, while AMF pinsetters have a higher chance of bouncing out the pin facing away from the ball return of a lane pair. The second method is to strike either pin on the inside with enough velocity to bounce it off the side wall (kickback plate) and rebound onto and across the deck into the other pin. The third way is to slide one of the pins into the other. This is incredibly rare, but pro bowler Sean Rash did it by sliding the 10-pin into the 7-pin in 2019 during qualifying at the Tournament of Champions.\nMark Roth was the first bowler to pick up the 7–10 split on television on January 5, 1980, at the ARC Alameda Open at Mel's Southshore Bowl in Alameda, California. The only other three professionals to convert this split on television are John Mazza and Jess Stayrook, both of whom did it in 1991, and Anthony Neuer, who accomplished it in April 2021. Roth and Mazza converted theirs on ABC broadcasts of the Professional Bowlers Tour, while Stayrook did his on an ESPN telecast. All three converted their splits by bouncing a pin out of the pit. Anthony Neuer converted the split during the U.S. Open Stepladder Finals when the 10 pin bounced off of his ball in the pit and kicked into the 7 pin.\nOther common splits.\nThis is similar to the 7–10, as they are both splits with pins on the back row of the deck. It is also just about as difficult to convert. However, it is possible to slide the 9 or 8-pin into the 7 or 10 pin, but there is only a 0.05 inch (1 mm) margin of error.\nSimilar to a 6–7 split, but since the pins are closer, the 5-pin does not need to be hit at such a fine angle to hit the 7-pin. Another rare method is to deflect an extremely light ball (under 10 lb) off the 5-pin.\nSimilar to above, one must use a light ball (under 10 lb) to deflect the 5-pin into either the 7- or 10-pin, deflecting the ball into the other back pin. It is also possible to slide the 5-pin into either back pin; with luck, either downed pin (depending on which side the bowler chooses to go) will slide or roll into the third pin. It is among the most difficult splits to convert.\nThe 5–7–10 is considered the most embarrassing split of all, because not only is it almost impossible to make, it is left by throwing a \"flat ball\", that is, a shot with no revolutions or action on it.\nSimilar to a 5–7 split, but since the 3-pin is two rows ahead of the further from the 7-pin, the ball must hit the right side of the 3-pin at a slight angle.\nThis is the easiest split to convert since there are two options: A) sliding the 2-pin into the 7-pin; B) deflecting the ball off the \"front\" pin. This can be achieved with a ball of any weight since the pins are close enough together.\nThis split is basically the Baby split with the opposite corner pin. The player should ignore the \"opposite\" pin and play the Baby split between the pins. With luck, the front pin will be able to slide over to get the other pin.\nThese splits are similar to the 7–10 split, but are easier to pick up because of the extra pin. Always aim for the side with the two pins to ensure a possibility of a pick-up. Note that these splits are identical to the 4-10 and 6–7.\nThese splits are a little easier to convert as opposed to the 4-10 (6-7). The 4-7-9 and 6-8-10 spilts are equivalent to these.\nThe Big four (also known as The \"Golden Gate split\", \"Big ears\" or \"Grandma's teeth\" split) consists of the two pins on either side of the pin deck. It is similar to the 4–7–10 and the 6–7–10, as a common attempt to make the split will consist of sliding the 4 or 6 pin into the remaining two pins on the other side (the ball will take out either the 7 or 10 pin). As with virtually all splits, it is possible to make by bouncing a pin out of the pit. An older nickname for this split is \"Double pinochle\".\nThe only professional to convert this split on television is Walter Ray Williams, Jr., doing so on an ESPN telecast in 2005, although there have been other bowlers to do so on camera.\nSimilar to baby splits because of their close distance from one another, the side-by-side split is almost always made by fitting the ball in between the two pins left standing. A much rarer conversion of the split involves sliding one pin into the other. A similar split (4–5–7 or 5–6–10) should be made the same way. Also called \"Fit splits;\" the 4–5 was referred to as the \"Steam fitter\" on \"Make That Spare\".\nThis split is similar to the Big four, except there is another pin included (either the 8 or 9 pin). This split is believed to be slightly easier to convert than the Big four, because sliding the 6-pin over (for right-handers) will sometimes cause the 6-pin to ricochet off the 9-pin and set a crash course for the 4 and 7 pins. Also \"shooting the two\" (4-7 for right-handers) can work if the bowler can get the 4 pin to glance/bounce off the front of the 9 pin. Statistical review, however, reveals this shot to be the least-converted in professional bowling.\nThis split is most easily converted by sliding either the 2-pin (for left-handers) or the 3-pin (for right-handers) into the two pins on the other side of the pin deck. The ball should take out either the 6–10 (for right-handers) or the 4–7 (for left-handers).\nThis split is similar to the Big five, but is made slightly harder because there is another pin in the back row, creating a split with two pins on one side and four pins on the other. The split should be made with a drastic curve on the back end of the lane, so that the ball can convert the four pins and have the frontmost pin take the two remaining pins out.\nAlthough not a split, as the headpin (1 pin) is still standing, washouts involve a setup of pins which are spaced out, including the headpin. Common examples of the washout include the 1–2–4–10, 1–2–8–10, 1–3–6–7, and 1–2–10. Washouts are easier than most splits, because the headpin is in the front of the pin deck and therefore gives the bowler more room for error. The type of washout one leaves largely depends on if the bowler is left-handed or right-handed. For example, a left-handed bowler would leave washouts such as the 1–3–6–7 and 1–3–7–9, while a right-handed bowler would leave the 1–2–4–10 and 1–2–8–10. Modern variants include the 1-2-4-6-10 and 1-3-4-6-7, where the bowler only picked a single pin out as opposed to the normal two (picked 3 pin for right-handers, 2 pin for left-handers).\nUncommon splits.\nWith the use of six-pound balls and/or very slow ball speeds, other splits not normally seen can be left due to that light-weight ball either deflecting into the gutter or stopping on the pin deck after contacting the pins. An example of this is the 6-7-8-9-10.\nEquivalent splits.\nSince the pins are set up as an equilateral triangle, identically spaced splits can occur on different parts of the lane. Converting them would be done in the same manner.\nSplits in candlepin bowling.\nAs in the tenpin game, splits can also occur in the New England and Canadian Maritimes-centered sport of candlepin bowling. As candlepin bowling uniquely \"allows\" the use of fallen \"dead wood\" pins to remain on the lane to be used in assisting the felling of standing pins for spare and split conversions, still the most notable split in the candlepin sport is the \"spread eagle\", the six-pin leave made up of the 2-3-4-6-7-10 combination, that due to the aforementioned \"fit split\" status of the 2–3 split in tenpins (but, with the smaller candlepin ball, the 2 and 3 pin can't be hit together with it) and the \"spread eagle\" almost never occurs in tenpins, with the closest split to it being the 2-(or 3-)4-6-7-10.\nIn contrast, even more difficult splits such as the infamous 7–10 split may be easier to convert in candlepin, since fallen pins are left on the lane after being knocked down; thus, if enough pins are spread across the lane, a strategically bowled ball could knock the fallen pins into both the 7 and 10 at the same time.\nExternal links.\nRecorded 7–10 split conversions\nRecorded 4–6–7–10 split conversions"

        "text": "World number 1 ranked male tennis players is a year-by-year listing of the male tennis players who were ranked as world No. 1 by various contemporary and modern sources. The annual source rankings from which the No. 1 players are drawn are cited for each player's name, with a summary of the most important tennis events of each year also included. If world rankings are not available, recent rankings by tennis writers for historical years are accessed, with the dates of the recent rankings identified. In the period 1948–1953, when contemporary professional world rankings were not created, the U.S. professional rankings are cited.\nHistory of rankings.\nBefore 1912.\nFor the period between the birth of lawn tennis to 1912, few contemporary worldwide rankings exist. Some national tennis federations such as the USLTA (USTA) in the United States did create national rankings, however. Also, British publications ranking British players are listed. Retrospective world rankings made by the International Tennis Hall of Fame are also listed.\nBetween 1912 and 1973: opinion-based rankings and professional series rankings.\nBefore the Open Era of tennis arrived in 1968, opinion-based rankings for amateur players were generally compiled either for a full year of play or in September following the U.S. Championships. Professional players were ranked by journalists, promoters, and players' associations in opinion-based rankings either at the end of the year or in the spring or summer when the world pro tours finished. There were also performance-based point ranking systems attached to professional tournament series in 1946, 1959, 1960, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1968, and performance-based pro rankings from the pro tours in 1942, 1954, 1961, and 1963. Even for amateurs, however, there was no single official overall ranking that encompassed the entire world. Instead, national rankings were compiled by the national tennis association of each country, with world rankings being the preserve of tennis journalists or newspaper reporters. The end-of-year amateur rankings issued by official organizations such as the United States Lawn Tennis Association were based on judgments and opinions and not on mathematical formulae assigning points for wins and losses.\nProfessional tennis in Europe before 1926.\nThomas Burke, tutor of the Tennis Club de Paris and former teacher of two-time Wimbledon champion Joshua Pim, was reportedly as good a player as the leading amateurs. Charles Haggett was the best English teaching professional during the early 20th century. In 1913, Haggett settled in the United States, having been invited by the West Side Tennis Club of Forest Hills, New York and became the coach of the American Davis Cup team. In practice matches, he beat the leading amateurs Anthony Wilding, Wimbledon winner and Maurice McLoughlin, Wimbledon All Comer's winner.\nIn the 1920s, Karel Koželuh, Albert Burke (son of Thomas Burke), and Roman Najuch were probably the most notable, as well as the best, of these players. The Bristol Cup, held at Beaulieu or at Cannes on the French Riviera and won seven consecutive times by Koželuh, was \"the world's only significant pro tennis tournament.\" Koželuh went on to become one of the best of the touring professionals in the 1930s. He and Burke, however, were not listed among the top players before 1928, as this was the first year when a retrospective ranking was published for all the top players, amateur and professional.\nMajor professional tournaments before 1968.\nThree major tournaments held a certain tradition and usually had the best of the leading players. The most prestigious of the three was generally the London Indoor Professional Championship. Played in most years between 1934 and 1990 at the Wembley Arena in the United Kingdom, the tournament was authorised by the Lawn Tennis Association from the 1950s onwards. The oldest of the three was the United States Professional Championship, played between 1927 and 1999 (except 1944 and 1996) with the approval and participation of the USPLTA from 1928 to 1954. In 1950, the USPLTA U.S. Pro was held in Cleveland. In 1951, the USPLTA U.S. Pro was held at Forest Hills, however there was also in 1951 the PTPA-approved U.S. Pro (under the billed name International Pro) held at Cleveland. Between 1952–53 and 1955–62 the PTPA version of the U.S. Pro was played in Cleveland (under the billed name International or World Professional Championships). The USPLTA U.S. Pro was held again at the L.A. Tennis Club in 1954 under Kramer's management, however the Cleveland version of the U.S. Pro was also held in 1954 under the billed name World Professional Championships. The third major tournament was the French Professional Championship, played at Roland Garros in the years 1930–1932, 1934–1939, 1956, 1958–62 and 1968, and at Stade Coubertin from 1963 to 1967. The British and American championships continued into the Open Era, but devolved to the status of minor tournaments.\nThese three tournaments (Wembley Pro, French Pro and U.S. Pro) through 1967 are often referred to retrospectively as the major pro events by tennis historians. However, in some years other tournaments had stronger fields and larger money prizes. The 1957 Forest Hills Tournament of Champions was broadcast live in its entirety on the CBS national television network in the U.S. The in 1966 boasted the largest prize money of the season, and a film was made of the final. The Wimbledon Pro in 1967 was broadcast complete in colour on BBC television in Britain and awarded the largest prize money of any pro tournament up to that time.\nBefore 1973, there were only a few rankings based on the points players obtained for achieving a certain level of performance in particular tournaments, but there were journalists or officials (on their personal behalf) or promoters or players themselves who listed their own subjective annual rankings. In 1946, 1959, 1960 and 1964–1968 there were point ranking systems and seeding lists applied to professional series of tournaments involving all of the best pros. In 1946, 1959 and 1960 there were also World Professional Championship tours with a small number of pros, which did not produce point rankings. The winners of the 1946, 1959 and 1960 World Professional Championship Tours were described as \"world champion\" in many reports, although the points ranking system in 1959 was also referred to in Kramer's brochure with the term \"World Championship Tennis\". In 1961 and 1963, the ITPTA World Championship Tour produced an official ranking order for the contract professionals. In some years, however, only a small number of professional promoters, players or journalists released opinion-based rankings at the end of the tennis year. Retrospective opinion-based-rankings by tennis historians or sports statisticians many years after the tennis year ended (e.g. in the 2000s for a year in the 1950s) are also listed.\nFrom 1973 onward: modern ATP rankings.\nIn August 1973, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) introduced its own rankings. These mathematical merit-based rankings were published 11 times that year and with increasing frequency the following years until they were published weekly from 1979 onward. In the 1970s and 1980s they did not take into account certain events, such as the Davis Cup, the WCT Finals and the year-end Masters (currently named the ATP Finals). Stan Smith, a leading player in the 1970s when ATP rankings started said \"there was a great deal of conversation and tweaking during the formative years as to the weight of the various tournaments and even the weight of the rounds in the tournaments. The prize money per round was also debated in conjunction with the ranking points.\" Since 1990 the ATP has awarded points for the ATP Finals.\nDisputed rankings.\nIn the early years after the ATP rankings were introduced, other rankings proposed by tennis experts or by the players themselves were possibly more accurate because they included those events and adjusted the rankings to reflect the actual importance of particular tournaments. In 1977, Connors was No. 1 in the ATP ranking but Borg and Vilas were the men that received most No. 1 rankings from other sources. Since the 1990s, the ATP rankings have generally been accepted as the official rankings. Since 1978 the ITF (represented initially by a panel of experts consisting of Don Budge, Lew Hoad and Fred Perry) designated the yearly ITF World Champions.\nSome recent tennis writers provide rankings for certain players in the distant past on the basis of periods, for example Kramer ranked as No. 1 for the period 1946 to 1953. Notations will be made for annual No. 1 rankings derived from a period ranking.\nList of No. 1 ranked players.\n1877–1911: National and world rankings.\nEarly tennis era rankings are more variable in nature due to limited sourcing. Few contemporary worldwide rankings exist for this period.\n1912–present: Annual and year-end rankings.\nFrom 1912 sources are more detailed and better documented. All players who received a world number one ranking citation during the year are listed in the number one column.\nOpen Era.\nProfessional players were allowed to compete with amateurs in one unified tour starting 1968 (all players in the Open Era are professional unless otherwise indicated)."

The tournament is now played over seventeen days in late April and early May, and is chronologically the third of the three Triple Crown events of the season. The event was not held from 1941 to 1945 because of World War II and between 1958 and 1963 due to declining interest from players.\n the governing body that organises this event is the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). Prior to the WPBSA assuming control of the professional game in 1968, the world championship was organised by the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC), except for between 1952 and 1957 when the Professional Billiards Players' Association (PBPA) staged their own event, the World Professional Match-play Championship, following a dispute with the BACC.\nAs of 2023, 27 players have won the World Snooker Championship. The most successful player at the World Snooker Championship is Joe Davis, who won fifteen consecutive titles between 1927 and 1946. The record in the modern era, usually dated from the reintroduction in 1969 of a knock-out tournament format, rather than a challenge format, is shared by Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan, both having won the title seven times."

He most recently played with the Quad City Mallards of the Central Hockey League during the 2011–12 season. McKee was formerly a star college goaltender at Cornell University.\nEarly life.\nMcKee was born in Midland, Texas. He started for three years at Cornell University. During his record-breaking college career, he had a career record of 65–24–13 with a .926 SV%, 1.71 GAA and 18 shutouts. During the 2003–04 season, he had a shutout streak of 159:27 from December 5 to December 28. Even though his rookie year was astounding, nothing could compare to the end of the 2004–05 season, where over his final 21 games, he allowed just 20 goals while posting a 0.93 goals against average and a .962 save percentage to go along with an 18–2–1 record to help lead his team to win the ECAC title. He led the Cornell Big Red to a season record 19-game unbeaten streak. During that season, McKee also recorded a record-breaking 10 shutouts.\nCareer.\nOn April 1, 2006, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim announced that they signed him with a two-year entry-level contract. Mighty Ducks executive vice president and general manager Brian Burke said, \"Over the past two seasons, David McKee has proven to be one of the premier players at the collegiate level. He is a great addition to the core of young talented players within our organization.”\nMcKee began the season playing for the Augusta Lynx, the ECHL affiliate of the Anaheim Ducks. He was briefly assigned to the Portland Pirates of the AHL, but was sent down to get playing experience. He quickly became starting goaltender for the Lynx, picking-up his first professional win came on October 21, 2006, against the Gwinnett Gladiators. He is currently on top of the ECHL standings, with the most shootout wins (3), the second most wins (8), the fourth most saves (355), and is fifth in minutes played (651).\nMcKee has been called up to the NHL several times during his first professional season. His first stint began on November 21, 2006, as backup for Jean-Sébastien Giguère while Ilya Bryzgalov was unavailable due to a lower body injury. He was dressed for three games, until Giguère sustained an injury and was scratched against the Calgary Flames on November 26. McKee backed up Mike Wall, who was called up from Portland on the same day. After his fourth game, McKee rejoined the Lynx. McKee also played in the 2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships."

The only things preserved were the accounts of 1858-59 signed by John Cowle, as the Honorary Secretary and Treasurer, and he goes down in history as the first officer on record. In these records it is noted that a six oared boat was purchased for Rs. 300 and the following year a ‘Four’ was imported from Hong Kong for a sum of Rs. 448. After the cyclone, a temporary thatched roof boat house was built in 1861, on the banks of the Hooghly near Chand pal Ghat, the Regatta course was 1 mile from Fort Point to Shalimar or from Shalimar to Botanical Gardens. In 1864 the Club colours of Blue and White were adopted.\nThe club competed at the Head of the Lake Regatta, an annual rowing competition that began in 1933. At the 1950 All-India Regatta, the CRC won trophies in all three events — sculls, pairs and fours. The feat was previously achieved only by the Royal Connaught Boat Club in 1936.\nPresent location.\nWith the construction of the Dhakuria Lake in 1928, the club moved to its present location- 15 Rabindra Sarobar, Calcutta-700029. CRC has maintained its outstanding position in the rowing scene and from 1979 won the ARAE, the WBRA and the Head of Lake trophies - a stream of unique successes which no rowing club in the East has yet been able to achieve.\nReciprocal clubs.\nThe club has reciprocal arrangements with more than 100 clubs throughout the world. Members can use the facilities of overseas reciprocal clubs with a card or letter of introduction issued by the Calcutta Rowing Club."

In 2015 it was closed to visitors for major restoration works.\nDuring the 17th century various improvements were made to the court. One of the first acts of Charles II after his restoration in 1660 was to order the extensive refitting of the Tudor tennis court. This included the laying of a new tile floor, the remodelling of the galleries and repairs to the roof. At the same time, new nets, curtains and velvet cushions for the spectators' seats were provided. The interlaced initials above the net on the wall opposite the corridors are, however, not those of Charles but of William III and Mary II (1689–1702). Since the end of the 17th century the court has undergone little alteration.

        "text": "The Williams Rugby Football Club (WRFC) and the Williams Women's Rugby Football Club (WWRFC) are intercollegiate club sports teams at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. The men's club was founded in the spring of 1959 by David Coughlin with support from J. Peter Pierson, the team's first coach. The men's and women's clubs play in NERFU Division II. Beyond the sport itself, the teams endeavor to foster a sense of community for participants and to provide a safe social environment not only for the players on the team but for the Williams community as a whole.\nOrigins.\nMen's team.\nThe Williams Rugby Football Club (WRFC) was founded by David Coughlin '61 in the spring of 1959 following spending a year studying abroad at Glenalmond College, Scotland. Starting with a handful of incoming freshmen with experience playing rugby while studying in England, the Club was formed and supported by Peter Pearson, the first Williams Rugby coach. The following fall, the WRFC entered the Eastern Rugby Union (ERU) and won the ERU Championship in 1960 with a 5-0-1 record. Following a 1962 tour in England, support and recognition from the College increased dramatically.\nThe distinctive Williams Rugby Football Club crest was designed by Coughlin and Pearson, and the team colors, claret and gold, were borrowed from Pearson's home team Huddersfield RFC. During the initial days of Williams Rugby, the college was reluctant to endorse and support the Club, so Pearson contacted his teammates at Huddersfield who provided the initial contributions of balls, equipment, and claret and gold uniforms. While the rest of Williams College's athletic teams sport purple and gold, the WRFC and WWRFC sport claret and gold to honor their comrades from Huddersfield.\nWomen's team.\nThe Williams Women's Rugby Football Club (WWRFC) was founded in 1976, six years following the decision to make Williams co-ed, by John Greer and Dave Libardi.\nTraditions.\nAmherst rivalry.\nLike other sports teams at Williams College, both the men's and women's teams have a long-standing rivalry with Amherst College. As a part of the WRFC's rivalry with Amherst, both teams' starting lineups bet their jerseys on the outcome of the game, with the losing team forfeiting his or her jerseys.\nThe WWRFC has a long-standing tradition of wearing their jerseys for the entire week prior to their annual game with Amherst. If the WWRFC were to lose to Amherst, Amherst would receive smelly and muddy jerseys.\nJohn Donovan Memorial Tournament.\nEvery year, the men's rugby team hosts the John Donovan Memorial Tournament in the springtime, a rugby tournament and fundraiser to support the mental health services at the Brien Center. The tournament is held in honor of John Donovan, a rugby alumnus of Williams College who committed suicide as a result of unresolved mental illness.\nMottos.\nThe men's and women's undergraduate teams are known as the White Dawgs (as opposed to \"ephs,\" the moniker of the rest of Williams College athletic teams). The men's alumni are known as the Olde Fartes. Their men's motto is \"Nihil in Moderato\", loosely-translated Latin for \"nothing in moderation\". The women's team alumnae are known as \"Used Bagges,\" and their team motto is \"\"Scite Terroris\",\" which translates from Latin as \"Know Fear.\"\nNotable alumni.\nThe Williams Rugby Football Club has a long-standing history of maintaining a tightly-knit alumni network with especially prominent alumni in the fields of politics, venture capital, and banking."

        "text": "David Rodney Lewis (born July 3, 1953) is a Canadian former National Hockey League (NHL) defenceman and coach. He was most recently an assistant coach of the Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL. He has both Canadian and U.S. citizenship.\nPlaying career.\nLewis began his playing career with the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Canada Hockey League. He was drafted by the New York Islanders in the 1973 NHL Entry Draft, third round, thirty-third overall. He played sixteen seasons with the New York Islanders, Los Angeles Kings, New Jersey Devils, and Detroit Red Wings, scoring 36 goals and 224 points in 1,008 games.\nCoaching career.\nAfter Lewis' playing career ended with the Red Wings in the 1987–88 season, he stayed with the team as an assistant coach. He helped Detroit win three Stanley Cups in 1997, 1998, and 2002. When Scotty Bowman retired in 2002, Lewis was named head coach of the Red Wings. In two seasons, he guided the Red Wings to two 48-win campaigns, including a Presidents' Trophy. In the playoffs, however, he had a record of 6–10. After the lockout ended, his contract was allowed to expire on June 30, 2005. He was re-hired by the Red Wings on August 9, 2005, as a scout.\nOn June 29, 2006, Lewis was named the 27th head coach of the Boston Bruins. His one and only season with the Bruins was not successful, as they finished with a 35–41–6 record, missing the playoffs for the second year in a row, and finishing in last place in the Northeast Division. In June 2007, Lewis was fired as coach of the Bruins by general manager Peter Chiarelli because of the team's highly inconsistent play throughout the season.\nLewis subsequently signed on as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Kings for the 2007–2008 season. On August 4, 2008, it was announced he would not return for the 2008–2009 season.\nOn November 5, 2010, Lewis, whose maternal grandparents were from Ukraine, was hired as the coach of the Ukraine national team, though his association with that team was short-lived.\nOn June 7, 2011, Lewis was hired as the assistant coach of the Carolina Hurricanes. Lewis was fired along with head coach Kirk Muller and assistant coach John MacLean on May 5, 2014.\nIn December 2014, Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Belarusian national team. The contract was for one year with the possibility of extension up to the 2018 Olympics. Lewis has been the head coach for Belarus at the 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 World Championships. However, the team fell just short of qualifying for the 2018 Olympics. Lewis was fired just three games into the 2018 World Championships after Belarus lost all three games."

        "title": "2006 English cricket season",
        "text": "The 2006 English cricket season was the 107th in which the County Championship had been an official competition. It included home international series for England against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. England came off a winter with more Test losses than wins, for the first time since 2002-03, but still attained their best series result in India since 1985. The One Day International series against Pakistan and India both ended in losses.\nIn domestic cricket, Nottinghamshire, holders of the County Championship, were relegated, and it was Sussex who took the Championship title as their Pakistani overseas player Mushtaq Ahmed ended with 102 wickets. Sussex pipped Lancashire to the title, as they did in the one-day C&amp;G Trophy, which was changed from a direct knock-out into two regional leagues of 10, from which two teams progressed to the final at Lord's, where Sussex won by 15 runs. \nEssex Eagles defended their National League title from last season, a league tournament that has been shortened from 16 to eight matches per side and officially named Pro40. They finished level with Northamptonshire Steelbacks in the table, though the Steelbacks lost by 109 runs in their meeting. The Twenty20 Cup completed its fourth instalment during 2006, and was won by Leicestershire Foxes, the first team to win the Twenty20 Cup twice.\nMonthly Reviews.\nApril.\nThe season's opening first class game, the Champion County match at Lord's, began on 14 April with a Marylebone Cricket Club team taking on Nottinghamshire. Nottinghamshire earned a lead of 23 on first innings after bowling MCC out for 168, and after centuries from Jason Gallian, Chris Read and Mark Ealham, they declared with a day to spare. Despite 94 from No. 8 Tim Bresnan, MCC lost by 142 runs. A day later, the six three-day university matches between county sides and university teams had begun: the matches were all drawn, though no county team failed to bowl out their opponents in the first innings, and all county teams declared their first innings closed.\nOn 18 April, the County Championship began, but the first matches were dominated by rain; at Old Trafford, Lancashire and Hampshire played out 169.3 overs, compared to the minimum of 408 set out in ECB regulations, in a drawn game, while Gloucestershire overcame Somerset in Division Two despite 36 and 172 from Australian overseas player Cameron White. Excluding extras, the other ten players contributed with 197 runs, eleven less than White. The other five matches began a day later: Durham's first outing in Division One ended with victory, as Gordon Muchall hit 219 in the first innings and Kent were bowled out for 340 and 179 to leave Durham with a win by an innings and 56 runs, while Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, Sussex and Warwickshire all recorded draws. In Division Two, Surrey's first match after relegation saw them save the draw after following on against last year's wooden spoon winners Derbyshire, and Essex and Northamptonshire also drew. Two of the three university matches that week had two days rained out; the third, between Middlesex and Oxford UCCE was drawn.\nThe first round of the league stage of the C&amp;G Trophy was played out on 23 April. In the South Conference, Essex (in a 10-over affair), Gloucestershire, Hampshire and Somerset (after Marcus Trescothick's 158) recorded wins, while Derbyshire, Lancashire and Worcestershire won in the North. Sri Lanka began their tour the following day, drawing with a British Universities XI at Fenner's, and the second round of the Championship took place from 26 April to 29 April with seven matches. Durham fell back to earth after their initial win, giving up 421 runs in the first innings to Lancashire and losing by 128 runs, while Pakistanis Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed claimed 14 of 20 wickets for Sussex in their win at Hampshire, who failed to pick up batting points for the second time this season. Kent chased down 354 for the loss of three wickets against Middlesex at Lord's, and Warwickshire, despite giving up 433 in the fourth innings, beat Yorkshire to go top of the table.\nIn Division Two, Essex made 639 with three centuries before declaring against Glamorgan, which was enough to win by an innings and 30. Essex thus topped the table, while Glamorgan was bottom. Surrey beat Leicestershire by 99 runs, and Somerset beat Worcestershire in a match where three of the innings totalled less than 170 runs, and Somerset's first was worth 406 and full batting points. Meanwhile, three counties played university matches, with Nottinghamshire and Gloucestershire recording innings victories while Northamptonshire came back from a four-run first innings deficit against Cambridge to win by 193 runs.\nThe last matches of the month were those of the second round of the C&amp;G Trophy, along with Derbyshire's tour match against Sri Lanka. Derbyshire got a first innings lead of 43 after Sri Lanka declared their first innings closed, and Australian Travis Birt hit 83 off 53 balls before Derbyshire declared overnight on 208 for 4. In the C&amp;G Trophy, Ireland bounced back from an early loss when they successfully defended 193 against Gloucestershire, while Warwickshire made 352 for two against Scotland to win by 114 runs, and Sussex converted seven for two into a successful chase of 273 against Surrey.\nMay.\nOn 1 May, nine matches were played in the C&amp;G Trophy, with only Derbyshire and Yorkshire resting. Five of the matches were affected by rain, though no team played fewer than 30 overs. In the North, Durham won their first one-day game of the season, Scotland suffered their second loss in as many days at the hands of Nottinghamshire, Lancashire were the only team with two wins after bowling Worcestershire out for 129, while Warwickshire's 128 for 9 in 33 overs led to loss against Leicestershire.\nIn the South, Hampshire toppled leaders Essex after Shane Warne, Shaun Udal and Dominic Thornely shared out the last six wickets for 34 runs, in what was called a \"collapse in spectacular fashion\", securing an eight-run win. England international Darren Gough strained a hamstring during the game. Glamorgan beat Ireland by 15 runs but had England Test bowler Simon Jones injured, Surrey beat Kent by one solitary run in a 30-over affair at St Lawrence Ground, and Gloucestershire beat neighbours Somerset on the back of 112 off 79 balls from Ian Harvey and five wickets from spinner Martyn Ball, which meant they led the South Division after this round. The final match saw Sussex beat Middlesex to go third in the table.\nEight County Championship matches began on 3 May, along with the University match between Worcestershire and Bradford/Leeds UCCE, which Worcestershire won by 250 runs after making 500 for 2 declared in the first innings. Thus, Durham were the only team without a game. In Division One, Warwickshire were passed by Lancashire on the table despite beating Nottinghamshire by 60 runs - their first innings total of 248 only gave them one bonus point. Nottinghamshire wicketkeeper David Alleyne made 109 not out in the second innings, but was deserted by his batting partners as they totalled 316 in chase of 377 to win. Lancashire took the Championship lead, chasing 89 in the fourth innings and succeeding with the loss of four wickets against Kent at Old Trafford, while Sussex beat Yorkshire at Headingley after 11 wickets from Naved-ul-Hasan and 124 and 55 not out from Matt Prior. The final match saw Middlesex get their second loss of the season, as they were bowled out for 98 after opting to bat and ended with a ten-wicket defeat to Hampshire. \nSurrey took over the lead in Division Two after beating Gloucestershire by an innings and 297 runs, with Mark Ramprakash hitting 292 for Surrey, while Essex went down at home to Leicestershire after being forced to follow on. Somerset failed to exploit the first-innings 154 from Marcus Trescothick, losing by an innings and 46 to Northamptonshire, whose top-scorer Lance Klusener made 147 not out, and Derbyshire successfully defended a target of 213 against Glamorgan to win by 28 runs, with Steffan Jones taking six for 25.\nEngland A also played the touring Sri Lankans while this round of county cricket was on, starting their game on 4 May. Jon Lewis grabbed nine wickets in England A's ten-wicket win, while Robert Key was the only batsman to hit a half-century. The Sunday saw seven C&amp;G Trophy games: in the South, there was little change at the top, but Essex went third after downing Ireland. Middlesex and Somerset also recorded wins. In the North, rain affected all four matches; Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire had to abandon their clash at Headingley, while Lancashire extended their lead with an eight-wicket win at Northamptonshire. Durham and Derbyshire were second and third after wins, and Scotland defended 188 in 25 overs to beat Worcestershire and record their first win of the season.\nThe next round of the Championship had a staggered start: three matches began on 9 May, and five on 10 May. Warwickshire lost sight of the leaders after a 193-run loss to Hampshire, while Lancashire had to give up their league lead while being on a bye. They played Durham UCCE, drawing the three-day game. Sussex seized the chance, beating defending champions Nottinghamshire inside three days at Hove despite going 86 down on first innings, which was enough to see them take the league lead. Middlesex lost their third successive Championship match, to Durham, while Kent and Yorkshire drew.\nGlamorgan stopped their run of defeats in Division Two of the Championship, batting through 108 overs to make 267 for five after following on, while Essex went top of the table after beating Somerset in a game where Essex declared 71 behind on first innings. Somerset responded by declaring overnight on 275 for five, setting Essex 347 to win, which they made in 90.4 overs after being at 125 for four. There were also wins for Gloucestershire and Derbyshire.\nThis week also staged the first Test match of the English season. England, once again led by Andrew Flintoff due to Michael Vaughan's knee injury, batted first against Sri Lanka, declared on 551 for six, then took 19 wickets over the remaining three and a half days of play as the game ended in a draw. During the Test, seven matches in the C&amp;G Trophy were played; Kent recorded their first win, beating Hampshire on the last ball, while the still unbeaten Sussex and Essex broke away from the rest with wins and Surrey and Ireland played out a no-result in Belfast. In the North, Lancashire totalled 307 for three against Durham to win by 125 runs and extend their streak of one-day victories to four in four games, while Derbyshire remained second, also unbeaten, after bowling Warwickshire out for 197 to win by nine runs. Yorkshire opened their account of wins by beating Northamptonshire by two runs despite 161 from Northamptonshire's David Sales, and Worcestershire beat Leicestershire.\nThe next week included four Championship and three UCCE matches, in addition to Sussex' tour match with the Sri Lankans. Despite not playing Championship cricket, Sussex remained Championship leaders for another week, but Lancashire closed the gap to one point after their draw in Yorkshire, and Durham went third after attaining the same result at Nottinghamshire. In Division Two, Derbyshire, as the only unbeaten team, took over the lead with a home draw against Leicestershire, while Phil Jaques took 69 balls to hit 107 as Worcestershire chased 287 despite rain shortening their chase to 32 overs. Jaques, who played his first match in the English season, could later read that his innings was named \"Innings of the Week\" by Cricinfo. In the UCCE matches, Kent, Hampshire and Somerset all drew, as did Sussex in their tour match with Sri Lanka, which included centuries from Upul Tharanga, Thilan Samaraweera and Chamara Kapugedera before the visitors declared on 521 for five. Sussex' number eight Oliver Rayner then hit a debut 101 after coming in at 98 for six, helping Sussex to avoid defeat. In the C&amp;G Trophy, six matches were scheduled in England, but all ended in abandonment or no results due to the weather conditions. Scotland did get to play at Edinburgh, however, beating Northamptonshire by 52 runs. The top sides in both divisions were not scheduled to play, however.\nThe fourth and final week once again included the full Championship round of eight matches, in addition to the second Test match between England and Sri Lanka. Again, most matches ended in draws, though Sussex increased their lead after Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed shared 19 wickets in Durham's efforts of 110 and 80. Sussex totalled 229 in their only innings to win by an innings and 39 runs. Middlesex avoided defeat for the first time this season, but were still bottom, while Lancashire went second and Warwickshire third. In Division Two, Essex drew level with Derbyshire in the table after gaining four more bonus points, while Glamorgan were one wicket away from their first win of the season after having Worcestershire at 117 for nine; however, they finished the game with fewer points than their opponents Worcestershire. The Test gave England their first win of the home summer, with Liam Plunkett taking three top-order wickets as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 141. England took a first innings lead of 156 after a hundred from Kevin Pietersen, and despite Michael Vandort's second-innings hundred, England made it to the target of 81 with six wickets to spare.\nThe double round of C&amp;G Trophy matches saw 15 games played, six on 28 May and nine on the following day. The first day saw Derbyshire get their first defeat all season when they went down to Scotland at home, with Ryan Watson hitting 108 for the Scots. Lancashire failed to take advantage of Derbyshire's defeat, however, failing to defend 288 against Yorkshire, but they remained on top ahead of Worcestershire, who beat Northamptonshire on the back of a hundred from Phil Jaques. In the South, Sussex remained undefeated after chasing 297 to win at The County Ground, Chelmsford. Essex' total was helped by 132 from Ronnie Irani, but Murray Goodwin responded by making 158 not out for Sussex. Gloucestershire went second after defeating Glamorgan, while Ireland fell to bottom after losing to Middlesex.\nLancashire remained on top of the North Division at the end of May, despite playing out a no-result with Nottinghamshire, as Derbyshire beat second-placed Worcestershire to go back into second place, followed by Yorkshire who defeated Scotland at Headingley. There were also wins for Durham and Warwickshire. In the South, Sussex stretched their runs of victories to five, which also saw them go three points clear of any challengers as Gloucestershire went down to Hampshire. Kent and Surrey also won matches in the South.\nJune.\nSix Championship matches began on 31 May, stretching into the first week of June. Sussex continued their winning ways, beating Middlesex at Horsham to win their fifth match out of six, while Kent and Hampshire also recorded wins in Division One. Surrey went top of Division Two after beating Essex at Whitgift School, while Glamorgan lost to Somerset inside two days at Swansea and Leicestershire played out a draw with Northamptonshire. The week also saw Durham beat Oxford UCCE by four wickets in the final University match, which included four centuries and in which no team were all out in any of their innings. \nOn 2 June, England began their chase of a series win against Sri Lanka, but chasing 325 on a fourth-day pitch against Muttiah Muralitharan proved too much; Muralitharan claimed eight wickets in the second innings as Sri Lanka won by 134 runs, bringing his tally for the series to 24. On the same day, Gloucestershire and Warwickshire finished their match, which ended in a draw after three innings exceeding 190 (from Vikram Solanki, Steven Davies and Craig Spearman). \nMeanwhile, eight matches were played in the C&amp;G Trophy: Derbyshire started early, losing to Nottinghamshire on 2 June after being bowled out for 194, but most games were played on 4 June. Durham beat Yorkshire on the last ball, England bowler Steve Harmison getting an \"inside edge...past wicket-keeper Gerard Brophy\" for four to secure a two-wicket win. Australian opener Jimmy Maher hit 124 not out for Durham, who still remained two points adrift of Lancashire after the Lancastrians won by five wickets against Scotland in Edinburgh. Northamptonshire got their seventh loss of the season, falling to Leicestershire, while in the South Sussex lost their first game of the season, Justin Kemp hitting seven sixes for Kent at Tunbridge Wells in a six-wicket win, while Hampshire, Middlesex and Somerset all won games.\nThe next week included seven Championship matches, with leaders Sussex taking on third-placed Lancashire at Old Trafford. Lancashire, with a game in hand, were trailing by 30 points before this, but closed the gap to 14 after taking advantage of a first-innings lead of 99. Sajid Mahmood then took five of Sussex' ten wickets as they were bowled out for 166, and Lancashire took a nine-wicket win inside two days. However, due to Hampshire's 299-run win over Nottinghamshire, Lancashire remained third, but still with a game in hand over the two teams ahead. Warwickshire came back from a 151-run first innings deficit against Durham, with Trevor Frost and Heath Streak putting on 119 for the ninth wicket and then Frost adding a further 20 with Lee Daggett. Those stands upped the target to 159, and Daggett then took six for 30 as Durham were bowled out for 141. The final game in Division One saw Middlesex get out of the relegation zone temporarily, as they bowled Yorkshire out for 130 in the third innings of the game and then chased down the target with eight wickets in hand.\nIn Division Two, Glamorgan got their first win after their Australian overseas player Mark Cosgrove hit 233 against Derbyshire, and Worcestershire beat Somerset with Ben Smith making a double hundred. Another double hundred came at The Oval, where Surrey made 668 for seven declared and Ali Brown 215 in their innings victory against Leicestershire. The win secured a substantial lead over second-placed Essex, who were playing the touring Sri Lankans in a one-day game and got a six-wicket win after half-centuries from Mark Pettini and Ryan ten Doeschate. \n11 June saw eight C&amp;G Trophy matches, and in the South, Sussex rebounded from their losses to take a three-point lead with two games to go, while Kent and Middlesex secured wins to stay in the hunt for the first place which would give a place in the final. In the North, Lancashire beat Derbyshire to eliminate the latter from contention, and the Northern spot was now purely between Lancashire and Durham with two weeks remaining of the competition. Somerset also played cricket, a tour match with Sri Lanka, which they won by 51 runs after posting 332 for six and then bowling Sri Lanka out for 281, with Charl Willoughby taking six for 43. \nEngland travelled to Ireland to play a one-off One Day International, where they beat their hosts by 38 runs after batting first and making 301 for seven, though they failed to bowl the Irish out in 50 overs. Two matches in Division One also started on that day, and were completed in three days, Kent beating Durham and Nottinghamshire escaping the relegation zone after beating Middlesex by an innings and 33 runs. Five matches started a day later, with Lancashire beating Warwickshire inside three days to take the Division One lead from Sussex, Somerset failing to defend 356 against Surrey at Bath with Ali Brown scoring 126 at faster than a run a ball, Worcestershire visiting Essex and scoring 650 for the second time in as many weeks to win by nine wickets, while Gloucestershire failed to convert their 750 runs into a victory over Derbyshire. The final match saw Glamorgan bowling Northamptonshire out for 178 and taking a first-innings lead, before a second-innings hundred from Usman Afzaal helped Northamptonshire total 400, setting Glamorgan 225 to win. Then, Matthew Nicholson took six wickets with the new ball, Monty Panesar three, and Glamorgan were bowled out for 56.\nMeanwhile, England were back playing Sri Lanka, this time for a Twenty20 International. After bowling Sri Lanka out for 163, England required 12 off the last eight balls, with opener Marcus Trescothick just run out for 72, and England could not quite score quickly enough, ending on 161 for five. In the C&amp;G Trophy, Sussex qualified for the final with a week to go when they chased 255 against Hampshire, in a match where Sussex captain Chris Adams claimed the hosts \"were dead and buried\" after 15 overs.\nThe One-day International series began on Saturday 17 June, and Sri Lanka batted first to win in both the first two matches: first defending 257 for nine after Upul Tharanga scored a career-best 120, then 319 for seven with Sanath Jayasuriya making a hundred.\nOn the weekend, five C&amp;G Trophy matches were played: Middlesex went second in the South Division after a three-run win at Somerset, taking over from Hampshire, while Essex and Gloucestershire also recorded wins. In the North, Northamptonshire won their first match of the season after Derbyshire lost their way from two to win and two wickets in hand, while Nottinghamshire beat Warwickshire.\nThe last County Championship round before the Twenty20 Cup began on 20 June. In Division One, both Lancashire and Sussex scored 22-point victories after piling on more than 500 runs in their first innings. Their victims, Middlesex and Yorkshire respectively, made up the foot of the table. Hampshire retained third place at the summer break despite going down to Durham; they were bowled out for 104 in chase of 332 on the third day, with Callum Thorp taking five wickets to complete his 11-wicket-haul in the match. In the final match of the division, Kent drew Nottinghamshire, in a match where 19 wickets fell for 1206 runs. In Division Two, Worcestershire closed the gap to Surrey to 18 points after an innings victory over Nottinghamshire, while Essex passed Derbyshire in the table with an eight-wicket win at Derby. Surrey drew with Glamorgan, surrendering a 72-run first innings lead to lose two points, and Gloucestershire won at Leicester. \nThe weekend began with Sri Lanka securing an unassailable 3–0 lead in the ODI series, chasing down 262 after a hundred from Mahela Jayawardene, before the final round of the C&amp;G Trophy on 25 June. In the North, Lancashire and Durham were neck-and-neck before the final round, with Lancashire heading the table on net run rate. And after chasing 250 at Warwickshire, they booked their place in the final, as Durham could not complete their part of the bargain; they failed to defend 274 after a hundred from Derbyshire's No. 5, Chris Taylor. The other matches in the North had Leicestershire, Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire as winners. In the South, Sussex bowled out Gloucestershire for 98 only to fall short by two runs in a match not affected by rain, Middlesex held on to second place after beating Kent, and Essex finished third after beating Surrey. There was also wins for Hampshire and Somerset.\nThe Twenty20 Cup began on 27 June with a full round of matches. In the North, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire recorded wins, Surrey won in the South along with Kent and Sussex after posting the highest score of the day with 218 for seven, including an opening stand of 148, before Tim Murtagh took three wickets and sent Middlesex to 13 for four, and in Midlands/Wales/West holders Somerset set a Twenty20 record total with 250 for three after Cameron White's unbeaten 116 and Justin Langer's 90, which saw them beat Gloucestershire by 117 runs. Warwickshire and Glamorgan also won.\nOn 28 June, Sri Lanka continued with their fourth successive ODI win, scoring 318 for seven with only Jamie Dalrymple conceding less than five an over, and bowling England out for 285 in the 49th over. Four Twenty20 matches were played in the evening: Essex and Surrey both bowled their opponents out for less than 110 in the South to achieve wins, Durham mustered 123 all out in a 52-run defeat at Nottinghamshire, and Glamorgan beat Warwickshire by six wickets after a 106-run stand between David Hemp and James Franklin. Four more games were played the following day, with three coming down to the last ball: Worcestershire needed three to win off three balls, but were limited by bowler Jon Lewis and Gloucestershire to a leg bye off the last ball, while Northants achieved a tie with Somerset after being 53 for five chasing 152 to win, and Lancashire hit the winning runs against Leicestershire on the final ball.\nIn the final match, Hampshire totalled 225 for two, and won by 59 runs.\nA full round of nine games was held on Friday 30 June, with Worcestershire getting bowled out for the lowest score of the competition this year, totalling 86 as Northamptonshire won their first game. In the other games in Midlands/Wales/West, Gloucestershire got their first win with a three-run win over Warwickshire, and Somerset were defeated by Glamorgan's last pair on the final ball. Surrey got their first loss of the year after Yasir Arafat of Sussex took four wickets in their five-wicket win, leaving Nottinghamshire (who beat Yorkshire by 21 runs) and Glamorgan as the only unbeaten teams in the competition. Leicestershire and Durham also won in the North.\nAugust.\nOn 12 August, Leicestershire became the first English county side to win the Twenty20 cup for a second time, in only its fourth year. The Foxes beat home side Nottinghamshire by 4 runs in a tense final at Trent Bridge. Man of the match Darren Maddy scored a record 86 not out in the final, and in doing so became the first man to score over 1000 runs in the format. On 20 August, the Fourth Test descended into chaos after the Pakistan team refused to come out after tea, in protest at having been penalised for ball tampering. The match subsequently became the first ever test to be forfeited and was awarded to England by the umpires."

He was a member of Don Shula's teams, which were often playoff contenders, and Green was a starter on those teams, racking up 7.5 sacks in 1989, to tie a career-high."

        "title": "Dodger (sailing)",
        "text": "A dodger (also known as a spray-hood) is a frame-supported canvas (usually with clear vinyl windows) structure partially protecting a helmsman and other occupants of a sailboat from harsh weather and seas. It covers part of the cockpit and the entrance (or \"companionway\") into the interior of the sailboat. One can usually stand under a dodger and be protected from rain, spray and snow travelling straight down or from the front/fore of the craft. There is little protection afforded from elements moving from aft to fore, but since the boat is usually moving forward or anchored by the bow and therefore facing into the wind this is seldom a problem. A similar type of shelter on a boat, without the forward and side protection, is called a Bimini top. Increased protection for the occupants of the cockpit is possible using a combination of dodgers/bimini tops and dodger extension."

        "text": "Bob Babich (born February 20, 1961) is an American football coach and former player, who was formerly the linebackers coach for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). Babich was the head football coach at North Dakota State University from 1997 to 2002, compiling a career record of 46–22. He played college football as a linebacker at the University of Tulsa in the early 1980s.\nEarly life and playing career.\nBabich was born and raised in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania and he is of Serbian descent. He attended Aliquippa High School, lettering in football and baseball. After graduating in 1979, he played two seasons as a linebacker at Mesa Community College in Mesa, Arizona, before transferring to the University of Tulsa, where he was a letterman on the Golden Hurricane football team from 1981 to 1982.\nCoaching career.\nBabich began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at his alma mater in 1984. The following year, he became a full-time assistant coach, tutoring the tight ends for new head coach Don Morton. Babich coached the team's offensive line and strong safeties the next two seasons, before following Morton to the University of Wisconsin. There he served as an offensive line coach from 1988 to 1989. He returned to Tulsa for one season as a volunteer offensive line coach, followed by another one-year stint at Bowling Green State University, where he coached the inside linebackers. In 1992, Babich joined Steve Logan's staff at East Carolina University in the same capacity. He held that position for two years until moving on to the University of Pittsburgh, serving as linebackers coach under Johnny Majors. During his final season at Pitt, he also handled the special teams. Babich earned his first head coaching position in January 1997, when he was named the head football coach at North Dakota State University.\nBabich entered the professional ranks in 2003 with the St. Louis Rams of the National Football League, serving as the team's linebackers coach. The next year, Rams defensive coordinator Lovie Smith was named head coach of the Chicago Bears and took Babich with him. After coaching linebackers during his first three years, he took over the role of defensive coordinator in February 2007, when the Bears decided not to renew the contract of Ron Rivera. Babich spent three seasons in that capacity, until he was returned to his prior position of linebackers coach. On January 17, 2013, Babich was among seven coaches released by new head coach Marc Trestman. In 2017, he was hired as Buffalo Bills linebackers coach. In 2022, Babich announced his retirement, with his son, Bobby Babich, replacing him on the Bills staff."

        "title": "Sean Marshall (baseball)",
        "text": "Sean Christopher Marshall (born August 30, 1982), nicknamed \"Big Smooth\", is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds.\nMarshall graduated from Manchester High School in Midlothian, Virginia, in 2000. He attended Virginia Commonwealth University, and was drafted by the Cubs in the sixth round of the Major League Baseball Draft. Marshall spent three years in the minor leagues before being promoted to play with the Cubs, and had 24 starts in his rookie season in . Marshall started the season on the disabled list, but returned to the Cubs' rotation in mid-May.\nMarshall's twin brother Brian also plays baseball, and was taken in the fifth round of the same draft by the Boston Red Sox.\nMinor league career.\nMarshall was drafted by the Cubs in the sixth round of the 2003 amateur draft after pitching for three seasons at VCU including a junior season where he went 7–2 with a 2.61 ERA recording 95 strikeouts in 86.1 innings. He signed with the Cubs on June 7, 2003, and was assigned to the Single-A Boise Hawks. Marshall was moved up a level each successive season, pitching in AA in and AAA in 2005. In 2006, Marshall spent the majority of the season with the major league team after starting the season at AAA. The following season he started in the minors, but as part of a rehab program healing from an arm injury.\nMajor League career.\nChicago Cubs.\nMarshall made his major league debut against the St. Louis Cardinals on April 9, 2006, recording a no-decision. In that game he yielded a two-run homer to Scott Rolen in the first inning before settling down to pitch solidly for 4+ innings. The Cubs trailed 4–3 in the late innings, but rallied to win on a Michael Barrett grand slam in the eighth inning. He earned his first major league win on April 14, 2006, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Marshall indicated his pleasure with the start. He stayed in the starting rotation for the first half of the year before suffering a strained left side muscle. Marshall left the rotation after a crushing loss on July 16 in which the Cubs gave up two grand slams in one inning, blowing a 5–2 lead in the 6th inning against the New York Mets. In 19 starts, Sean posted a 5–8 record with a 4.98 ERA. On September 2, Marshall returned to the Cubs' rotation, but posted a loss against the San Francisco Giants. During the game, he gave up career home run #728 to Barry Bonds in Chicago. In his remaining four starts, Marshall struggled, and completed six innings only once.\nMarshall was fighting for the fifth starting pitcher spot for the 2007 Chicago Cubs organization. After rehabbing from a sore shoulder he started the season in Des Moines, Iowa, with the AAA Iowa Cubs. On May 22, Marshall was promoted to the Cubs' starting rotation by manager Lou Piniella replacing Ángel Guzmán. Marshall struggled to get run support in his first two starts and fell to 0–2. On June 3, 2007, he claimed his first win of 2007 by matching a career high 8 strikeouts by leading the Cubs to a 10–1 victory over the Atlanta Braves.\nMarshall extended his string of quality starts with two additional wins against the Atlanta Braves and the Seattle Mariners, improving his record to 3–2. On June 13, 2007, Marshall pitched eight innings against Seattle, giving up seven hits and only two earned runs.\nMarshall continued his strong June, and was 4–0 with a 2.32 ERA, but was dealt a loss on June 30 by the Milwaukee Brewers lasting just two innings and giving up seven runs. In July, Marshall continued pitching well, giving up only six runs in his four starts; however, the Cubs did not provide much run support as he only gained one victory during the span.\nIn spring training in 2008, Marshall led the majors in wild pitches, with 5 in 14.2 innings. Marshall was not called up to the Cubs at the start of the season, however on April 9 he was recalled. That day, he collected his first major league save in a 15 inning Cubs victory against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Marshall pitched against the Baltimore Orioles on June 24. He pitched 4.2 innings gave up 7 hits 4 runs 1 walk but struck out 7.\nIn July 2009, he played in left field for one out.\nCincinnati Reds.\nMarshall was traded to the Cincinnati Reds on December 21, 2011, in exchange for Travis Wood, Dave Sappelt and Ronald Torreyes.\nOn February 27, 2012, Marshall signed a three-year, $16.5 million extension that runs through 2015. Each year of his contract has up to $2 million in bonuses, $1 million each for games started and games finished. He will earn $4.5 million in 2013, $5.5 million in 2014 and $6.5 million in 2015, excluding possible bonuses. The bonuses for games finished will be added to his current salary this year, as the starts bonus was already in his existing contract.\nAfter a season-ending injury to closer Ryan Madson, Marshall was named the Reds' closer for the 2012 season. However, due to Marshall's poor performance in the closing role, the Reds named phenom Aroldis Chapman the closer in late May 2012.\nPitching style.\nMarshall was unusual in that he threw breaking balls more than any other type of pitch; in 2011, almost 75 percent of his pitches were either curveballs or sliders. Marshall also possessed two fastballs, a four-seamer and a two-seamer, that he threw in the low 90s. In contrast to most pitchers, who get ahead in the count with a fastball and try to fool batters later with off-speed pitches, Marshall used his breaking balls early in the count and used his fastball most frequently when the count was 0–2. His curveball proved to be his best pitch at getting swings and misses, with a whiff rate of 40% in 2011. In 2012, Marshall revived an upper-80s cutter that he had not used since 2009.\nMarshall became successful in part through his propensity to get ground balls. His ground ball/fly ball ratio improved every season from 2008 to 2011, to the point that Marshall got more than two ground balls for every fly ball.\nPersonal life.\nMarshall is married to a woman named Sarah, with Ernie Banks performing the ceremony. In 2020, Marshall was hired as a pre- and post-game analyst for Cubs telecasts on Marquee Sports Network."

        "title": "Milwaukee Community Sailing Center",
        "text": "The Milwaukee Community Sailing Center is a private, non-profit 501(c)(3) agency. The Sailing Center provides educational and recreational sailing programs to those who wish to gain access to Lake Michigan and learn to sail; regardless of age, ability, or financial concerns. In 2004, MCSC celebrated its 25th year of sailing.\nMuch like a co-operative, the Sailing Center owns and maintains over 80 boats and provides members no-charge access to the fleet after they successfully demonstrate basic sailing skills and earn a rating. Membership is low cost, less than the cost of insurance on a privately owned sailboat, and works on a sliding scale based on age, experience and income. The Sailing Center also offers private boat owners 24-hour access to the lake, year-round boat and dinghy storage, mast stepping boat launching and haul out services.\nEach summer the Sailing Center partners with local organizations to provide sailing opportunities to thousands of at-risk and economically disadvantaged youth, the physically challenged and others. The Sailing Center also provides social activities and volunteer opportunities to members.\nMission.\nThe Milwaukee Community Sailing Center is a private, non-profit agency that works to strengthen the sport of sailing through an active and safe educational program and on-the-water experience.\nLocation/Sailing Area.\nThe Milwaukee Community Sailing Center () is located north of downtown in Veterans Park at McKinley Marina. The sailing area includes the McKinley mooring basin, the harbor behind Milwaukee's break wall, and for sailors who demonstrate proficiency and earn appropriate ratings and endorsements, Milwaukee Bay to one mile off the breakwall.\nFleet.\nThe fleet at the Milwaukee Community Sailing Center includes 35 Pearson Ensigns, 7 J-24s, 4 Solings and two larger cruising sailboats (a C&amp;C 29 and a Catalina 27). Youth and adults aspiring to centerboard sailing will experience a fleet of 10 Catalina 14.2s, 5 Club 420s, 6 RS-Touras, and 10 ILCA (formerly Laser) sailing dinghies. The MCSC support staff use a large fleet of safely boats, mostly Boston Whalers.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1977, the Milwaukee Community Sailing Center (MCSC) was created by a group of local sailors who sought to form a community organization to make sailing accessible to all in the Milwaukee area and dispel the myth that sailing is an elitist sport. With seed money from Ted Seaver, Doug Drake, and Milwaukee County, a maintenance facility was built. Completed in 1980, and the Sailing Center opened with lessons and boat rentals with a seasonal staff of 10 and a small fleet of Tech Dinghies, Volants and a safety boat.\nTwelve students graduated from sailing courses in the first year and gained access to sail the shared fleet. In the summer of 2023, MCSC offered over 1200 instructional sessions and members sailed almost 7000 times. In 1985, MCSC began \"Prams in the Park\", a program designed to bring sailing and water safety kids from 8-11 years old in Milwaukee County Park lagoons.\nToday, MCSC offers entry-level, intermediate and advanced sailing instruction, regattas, expeditions, volunteer instructor opportunities and open sailing seven days a week on a fleet of over 80 boats, one of the largest among sailing non-profits anywhere.\nA four person full-time, year-round staff, expands to 40 during the sailing season, and serves a base of over 700 members and 600 youth participants annually.\nMembership.\nMembers of the Milwaukee Community Sailing are able to participate in all programs the Sailing Center has to offer. Upon completion of appropriate courses and after successfully demonstrating basic sailing skills, individuals have no-charge access to the fleet during Open Sailing. Members are allowed to bring guests to sail and are able to participate in the Sailing Center's racing program. Members participate in social events, take advantage of the Sailing Center's grounds, which provide volleyball courts and a picnic area, meet new people and have a great time, which is what being a member of the Sailing Center is all about. For adults and youth, the Sailing Center offers three course levels; Basic, Intermediate and Advanced.\nOutreach Programs.\nThe Milwaukee Community Sailing Center has a variety of outreach programs that provide access to Lake Michigan through sailing and water safety training. Through coordinated efforts with many community service organizations, the Sailing Center is able to provide experiences to many individuals. The following are programs that the Sailing Center has put together to provide services for the needs of those interested in the joys and benefits of sailing."

        "text": "Ryan Day (born 23 March 1980) is a Welsh professional snooker player. He is a prolific break-builder, having compiled over 450 century breaks during his career, including four maximum breaks. He is a three-time World Championship quarter-finalist, has been ranked at no. 6 in the world and has won four ranking tournaments.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nDay was born in Pontycymer, Bridgend. A top amateur, he reached the final of the IBSF Championship in China in November 1998 but lost on the final black.\nDay began his professional career by playing UK Tour in 1998, at the time the second-level professional tour. He was named Young Player of Distinction of the season 2000/2001 by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). He won the 2001 Benson &amp; Hedges Championship. With this win, he qualified for the 2002 Masters, where he defeated Dave Harold, before losing 0–6 to Stephen Hendry. He also won the WPBSA Challenge Tour in the 2001/2002 season and was named WPBSA Newcomer of the Year in 2002. Due to problems with his liver in 2003, his results suffered badly.\nIn 2004, however, he qualified for the World Snooker Championship and he led John Higgins 9–7 in the first round, becoming the first player to score three in his first Crucible match, but missed a pink in the 17th frame that would have left Higgins needing a snooker to stay in the tournament. Higgins went on to win the frame and the next two for the match. As some consolation, Higgins commented that Day was \"going to be a top player for many years to come\".\n2005–2011.\nDay reached the quarter-finals of his home tournament, the 2005 Welsh Open defeating Ali Carter and Steve Davis along the way. He finished this season ranked 33, but as Quinten Hann did not participate in any events, Day was always among the top 32 seeds, meaning one less qualifying match than he would otherwise have faced.\nBack at the Crucible in 2006, he beat Joe Perry 10–3 in the first round and led Ronnie O'Sullivan 9–7 in the second round before losing 10–13. He narrowly missed reaching the top 16 of the rankings as a result.\nThe 2006/2007 season was the most successful of his career up till then. Day reached the quarter-finals of the 2006 Northern Ireland Trophy and was runner up in the 2007 Malta Cup, losing 4–9 to Shaun Murphy. That year's performance saw him ranked 16 in the world for the 2007/2008 season, one place higher than in the previous year. As a member of the Top 16, he automatically qualified for tournaments.\nDay's 2007/2008 season started with an appearance in the final of the Shanghai Masters; Day led his practise partner Dominic Dale 6–2 after the first session, but eventually succumbed to a 6–10 defeat. After failing to progress past the last 16 in the next three tournaments, he reached the semi-finals of the China Open, beating Matthew Stevens, Ken Doherty and Mark Williams before he was beaten by Stephen Maguire 5–6, denying him a place in the final. Day made it through to the quarter-finals of the World Championship for the first time in his career by beating Irishman Michael Judge 10–6 and the defending champion John Higgins 13–9 in one of the best wins of his career, before losing 7–13 to Stephen Hendry. His consistent performances took him up to 8th place in the rankings.\nDay reached the final of the 2008 Grand Prix where he lost to John Higgins, defeating Ricky Walden, Mark Selby, Jamie Cope and Ali Carter. The year ended on a disappointing note when he lost in the first round at the UK Championship to Matthew Stevens. He again reached the World Championship quarter-finals in 2009, before losing 11–13 to Mark Allen. However, he continued to move up the rankings, climbing two places to number 6, the highest ranked player not to have won a ranking event.\nA disappointing 2009–10 season in which he reached only one quarter-final (in the Welsh Open), culminated in an 8–10 first round defeat in the World Championship to Mark Davis. This continued into the next season where he made a number of early exits which meant that at the first revision under the new ranking system he dropped out of the top 16, down to number 20.\n2011/2012 season.\nDay qualified for five of the eight ranking tournaments during the 2011–12 season, but lost in the first round in four of them.&lt;ref name=\"2011/12\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His best performance came at the end of the season in the biggest event on the tournament calendar, the World Championship. He came back from 3–7 down in his qualifying match against Gerard Greene to win 10–8, to set up a first round match with China's number 1, Ding Junhui. Day produced another comeback, this time from trailing 6–9 to win the last four frames and advance to the second round. There he beat fellow qualifier Cao Yupeng 13–7 and held a 5–2 lead in the early stages of his quarter-final match against compatriot Matthew Stevens. However, he suffered a migraine at the start of the next session and went on to lose 11 consecutive frames to exit the tournament 5–13. Day finished the season ranked world number 30.\n2012/2013 season.\nDay lost in qualifying for the opening ranking event of the 2012–13 season the Wuxi Classic 0–5 to Robert Milkins.&lt;ref name=\"2012/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was then beaten in the second round of the Australian Goldfields Open and the Shanghai Masters, 3–5 to Matthew Selt and 0–5 to John Higgins respectively. Day was defeated 3–6 by Neil Robertson in the opening round of the International Championship, but then came perhaps the best result of his season at the UK Championship. He beat Ding Junhui 6–4 in a high quality first round encounter, before letting a 3–0 lead against world number two Mark Selby slip to lose 4–6. Day played in nine of the ten minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events during the season with his best results being two quarter-final defeats to be ranked 32nd on the Order of Merit, just outside the top 26 who qualified for the Finals. Day struggled in the second half of the season as he failed to qualify for four of the remaining five ranking events, losing 2–5 in the first round of the World Open to Mark Allen in the one he did reach. He failed to qualify for the World Championship for the first time since 2006, narrowly losing to Ben Woollaston 9–10 in the fourth and final qualifying round. He finished the season ranked world number 31.\n2013/2014 season.\nDay was beaten in the second round once and first round three times in the opening four ranking events of the 2013–14 season, but then reached the quarter-finals for the first time in over a year at the International Championship.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Day won the first frame against Joe Perry but was thrashed 6–1. He went a stage further at the German Masters and, in an attempt to play in his first ranking final since 2008, he came from 3–5 down against Ding Junhui to level the match, but lost the deciding frame. A trio of second round losses and a first round defeat in the China Open followed. At the World Championship, Stephen Maguire levelled the scores from 4–8 and 6–9 down in the first round, but Day won the final frame for a final score of 10–9, and advanced to the second round. His season then ended when he lost 7–13 to Judd Trump, but he did increase his ranking by 10 places to world number 21, his highest finish for four years.\n2014/2015 season.\nFor the second season in a row Day qualified for every ranking event. A pair of last 16 defeats at the Wuxi Classic and Shanghai Masters proved to be his best results in the first half of the year.&lt;ref name=\"2014/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the Haining City Open he achieved his first official maximum break in his last 32 match against Cao Yupeng. Day would go on to reach the quarter-finals, but lost 2–4 to Oliver Lines. After Day won the final two frames of his first round match against world number one Ding Junhui at the German Masters to eliminate him 5–4, he said that he was working on his consistency to get back into the highest echelons of the game. He then beat Alfie Burden 5–2 to face Liang Wenbo in Day's only quarter-final appearance of the season and was narrowly beaten 5–4. In Day's home event, he suffered a surprise 1–4 loss to amateur Oliver Brown in the second round of the Welsh Open. Day was 3–1 ahead of Mark Allen in the first round of the World Championship, but then lost nine successive frames to be knocked out 10–3.\n2015/2016 season.\nDay lost 4–5 to Ding Junhui in the second round of the Shanghai Masters, but turned the tables at the same stage of the International Championship by beating him 6–5. Day was defeated 4–6 by David Gilbert in the following round. However, in his next event he whitewashed Mark Selby 4–0 in the quarter-finals of the Bulgarian Open and beat Sam Baird 4–2 to play in the final of an event carrying ranking points for the first time since 2008, but he was thrashed 4–0 by Mark Allen. He lost 2–6 to Dechawat Poomjaeng in the second round of the UK Championship, but knocked out reigning world champion Stuart Bingham 5–3 to reach the quarter-finals of the German Masters. Day lost the final three frames against Kyren Wilson to be eliminated 4–5.&lt;ref name=\"2015/16\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He made two centuries and won the deciding frame on the final black against John Higgins to make another quarter-final at the World Grand Prix. He was defeated 2–4 by Bingham, losing the final frame from 56–0 points up, after Bingham made a 64 break. After being defeated 3–10 by Higgins in the opening round of the World Championship, Day said he would be working on his fitness in the off season in an attempt to improve his concentration during matches.\n2016/2017 season.\nDay advanced to the quarter-final stage of the Shanghai Masters by overcoming Neil Robertson and Mei Xiwen, both 5–2, before losing 3–5 to Mark Selby. He won the first four frames against Mark Allen in the third round of the UK Championship, but went on to lose 6–5. His second quarter-final of the season came at the German Masters and he was defeated 2–5 by Martin Gould. At the World Grand Prix, Day overcame Stuart Bingham, Michael White and Shaun Murphy all 4–2. In the semi-finals he was 3–4 down to Marco Fu, but recovered from needing four snookers in the eighth frame to level and went on to win 6–4. In Day's first ranking event final since 2008 he was 9–3 behind Barry Hawkins and, though he pulled it back to 9–7, he was defeated 7–10. Day lost in the final of the non-ranking Championship League 0–3 to John Higgins. A 4–2 win over Neil Robertson saw Day play in the semi-finals of the Gibraltar Open and he was beaten 4–2 by Judd Trump after leading 2–0. Day was a seeded player for the World Championship, but lost 4–10 Xiao Guodong in the first round and once again blamed his lack of concentration for the early exit.\n2017/2018 season.\nDay finally clinched his maiden ranking title in his fifth final appearance. The Welshman defeated Stephen Maguire 5–2 to claim the Riga Masters title. The Welshman sensationally stormed to consecutive titles at the 2018 Gibraltar Open and the 2018 Romanian Masters. He defeated Cao Yupeng and Stuart Bingham in the respective finals. Day reached the semi-final in the UK Championship, this was his first appearance in the semi-finals of a Triple Crown event, but he lost 3–6 to Shaun Murphy in the semi-final. Day also made a return to the Masters for the first time since 2010. He beat Ding Junhui 6–4 in the first round, but lost 1–6 to John Higgins in the quarter final.\n2018/2019 season.\nIn the Gibraltar Open, Day reached the final again by beating Lukas Kleckers, Noppon Saengkham, Elliot Slessor, David Grace, David Gilbert, and Lu Ning. But he was unable to defend the title as he lost 1–4 to Stuart Bingham in the final. Day qualified for the Masters again this season. He knocked John Higgins out in the first round, winning by 6–5. But he was defeated by Ronnie O'Sullivan in the next round, losing 3–6.\n2020/2021 season.\nDay secured his third ranking title by beating Mark Selby in the final of the Shoot Out. In April 2021, he failed to qualify for the World Snooker Championship after losing 5–10 to Ricky Walden in the final qualifying round.\nPersonal life.\nDay married his stepmother's sister, Lynsey, in the summer of 2008. The couple have two daughters, Francesca, born in 2006 and Lauren, in 2010. His younger brother Rhys has played football for Manchester City and the Welsh under-21 side."

        "title": "Stair climbing",
        "text": "Stair climbing is the climbing of a flight of stairs. It is often described as a \"low-impact\" exercise, often for people who have recently started trying to get in shape. \nA common exhortation in health pop culture is \"Take the stairs, not the elevator\".\nEnergy expenditure.\nIn one study based on mean oxygen uptake and heart rate, researchers estimated that ascending a 15 cm (5.9 inches) step expends 0.46 kJ (0.11 kcal) for the average person, and descending a step expends 0.21 kJ (0.05 kcal). The study concluded that stair-climbing met the minimum requirements for cardiorespiratory benefits, and considered stair-climbing suitable for promotion of physical activity.\nCompetitive sport.\nStair climbing has developed into the organized sport tower running. Every year several stair climbing races are held around the world with the competitors running up the stairs of some of the world's tallest buildings and towers (e.g., the Empire State Building, Gran Hotel Bali), or on outside stairs such as the Niesenbahn Stairway. World class athletes from the running and cycling worlds regularly compete in such events. Some have specialized exclusively in stair climbing races. Prizes, awards, and other accolades are given for the top performers by gender and age group. Stair climbing is one of the most grueling of sports, requiring competitors to move their entire body weight vertically, as well as horizontally.\nThe results of more than 160 races on all continents are evaluated each year for the Towerrunning World Cup. The most important - about 18 so called \"Masters Races\" - have a predefined factor of 1.5 to 2.5, whereas all other races are given 0.4, 0.7 or 1 depending on class and internationality of the participants. 2010 World Cup winners were Melissa Moon (NZL) and Thomas Dold (GER). 2011 winners are Dold (3rd time) and Cristina Bonacina (ITA). The World Cup Final 2012 was hosted on December 8 in Bogota (COL).\nAn annual competition, 'Girnar Arohan Spardha', is held in Junagadh, India, and involves a race to climb and descend the steps of the Girnar mountain.\nESPN8 The Ocho has a televised event called \"Slippery Stairs\".\nInfants and safe stair descent.\nFalling down a flight of stairs or just a couple of steps is very common during infants’ first exposure to stair descent. Infants are more likely to fall down stairs than any other age group. In the United States, approximately 73,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years have reported injury on stairs or steps in 2009.\nStair descent involves perceptual, cognitive and motor abilities. It relies heavily on visual information to enable balance and accuracy. Seeing obstacles ahead helps stair descent, but for infants the action of keeping their heavy head balanced enough to look down at their feet and the objective together, make the process very difficult. (Hurlke, 1998). Not seeing the task ahead causes confusion and disrupts concentration.\nInfants tend to adopt one of several strategies closely associated with stair descent:\nSome limited norms for stair climbing motor milestones have been established, but the process had historically been viewed like any other motor milestone - as a universal skill acquired through development.\nOne study looked at the typical age onset for stair ascent and descent, and compared them to other developmental milestones. It also looked at the stair climbing strategies that infants use. Consisting of 732 infants, and including parental assessment and documentation of motor skill achievements, along with in-depth interviews parents about the strategies involved and child assessment using laboratory stair apparatus. The results showed that children younger than 9 months of age were unable to go up or down stairs at all, or were only able to go up. By around 13 months, most infants could go upstairs and about half could ascend and descend stairs. Infants typically learned to descend stairs after they have already learned to ascend, with only about 12% achieved both stair-climbing skills at the same time.\nOn average in this study, infants learned to crawl and cruise before learning to ascend stairs independently. Infants were able to climb up the stairs before they could walk, but walking tended to come before independent stair descent. While most of the infants had prior stair experience, the presence or absence of stairs in the home did not influence the onsets of crawling, cruising or stair descent. However, lack of exposure to stairs resulted in a significant time-lag between first learning to ascend and to descend. Differences in housing types created a so-called 'suburban advantage' (i.e. houses with stairs versus flats/apartments without).\nSliding backwards feet first is the safest approach to descending stairs due to the fact that the midline of the body is closer to the staircase providing an even weight distribution on all four limbs. This might explain why it is exceptionally difficult for older people to descend stairs, because their midline is so far way due to longer arms and legs.\nOther research suggests that infants’ descent strategies may be related to their cognitive abilities. This is why most parents teach their children to back down stairs, even though it's the safest it is also the most cognitively difficult descent strategy."

        "title": "FIFA World Cup hosts",
        "text": "Eighteen countries have been FIFA World Cup hosts in the competition's twenty-two tournaments since the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The organization at first awarded hosting to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The choice of location was controversial in the earliest tournaments, given the three-week boat journey between South America and Europe, the two centers of strength in football at the time.\nThe decision to hold the first cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these, the 1938 FIFA World Cup, in France was controversial, as the South American countries had been led to understand that the World Cup would rotate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the tournament. The first tournament following World War II, held in Brazil in 1950, had three teams withdraw for either financial problems or disagreements with the organization.\nIn order to avoid any future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternation between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Asia. The system evolved so that the host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Congress. This is done under an exhaustive ballot system. The decision is currently made roughly seven years in advance of the tournament, though the hosts for the 2022 tournament were chosen at the same time as those for the 2018 tournament.\nOnly Mexico, Italy, France, Germany (West Germany until shortly after the 1990 World Cup) and Brazil have hosted the event on two occasions. Mexico City's Estadio Azteca is the only venue ever to have hosted two FIFA World Cup finals. Only the 2002 FIFA World Cup had more than one host, being split between Japan and South Korea, and in 2026 there will be three hosts: the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nUruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934, England in 1966, West Germany in 1974, Argentina in 1978 and France in 1998 are the countries which organized an edition of the World Cup and won it.\nUpon the selection of Canada–Mexico–United States bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the tournament will be the first to be hosted by more than two countries. Mexico becomes the first country to host three men's World Cups and its Estadio Azteca, should it be selected, will become the first stadium to stage three World Cup tournaments.\n1930 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nBefore the FIFA Congress could vote on the first-ever World Cup host, a series of withdrawals led to the election of Uruguay. The Netherlands and Hungary withdrew, followed by Sweden withdrawing in favour of Italy. Then both Italy and Spain withdrew, in favour of the only remaining candidate, Uruguay. The FIFA Congress met in Barcelona, Spain on 18 May 1929 to ratify the decision, and Uruguay was chosen without a vote.\nResults:\nNotice that the celebration of the first World Cup coincided with the centennial anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay. For that reason, the main stadium built in Montevideo for the World Cup was named Estadio Centenario.\n1934 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nSweden decided to withdraw before the vote, allowing the only remaining candidate Italy to take the hosting job for the 1934 World Cup. The decision was ratified by the FIFA Congress in Stockholm, Sweden and Zürich, Switzerland on 14 May 1932. The Italian Football Federation accepted the hosting duties on 9 October 1932.\nResults:\n1938 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nWithout any nations withdrawing their bids, the FIFA Congress convened in Berlin, Germany on 13 August 1936 to decide the next host. Electing France took only one ballot, as France had more than half of the votes in the first round.\nResults:\nCancelled FIFA World Cups 1942 and 1946.\nBids for 1942:\nCancelled FIFA election of the host due to outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939.\nBids for 1946:\n1950 and 1954 FIFA World Cups.\n1950 bid.\nBid:\nBrazil, Argentina, and Germany had officially bid for the 1942 World Cup, but the Cup was cancelled after the outbreak of World War II. The 1950 World Cup was originally scheduled for 1949, but the day after Brazil was selected by the FIFA Congress on 26 July 1946 in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, the World Cup was rescheduled for 1950.\nResult:\n1954 bid.\nBid:\nThe 1954 World Cup hosting duty was decided on 26 July 1946, the same day that Brazil was selected for the 1950 World Cup, in Luxembourg City. On 27 July, the FIFA Congress pushed back the 5th World Cup finals, deciding it should take place in 1954.\nResult:\n1958 FIFA World Cup.\nBid:\nArgentina, Chile, Mexico, and Sweden expressed interest in hosting the tournament. Swedish delegates lobbied other countries at the FIFA Congress held in Rio de Janeiro around the opening of the 1950 World Cup finals. Sweden was awarded the 1958 tournament unopposed on 23 June 1950.\nResult:\n1962 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nWest Germany withdrew before the vote, which took place in Lisbon, Portugal on 10 June 1956, leaving two remaining bids. In one round of voting, Chile won over Argentina.\nResults:\n1966 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nSpain withdrew from the bidding prior to voting by the FIFA Congress, held in Rome, Italy on 22 August 1960. Again, there was only one round of voting, with England defeating West Germany.\nResults:\n1970 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nThe FIFA Congress convened in Tokyo, Japan on 8 October 1964. One round of voting saw Mexico win the hosting duties over Argentina.\nResults:\n1974, 1978, 1982 FIFA World Cups.\nThree hosts for the 1974, 1978, and 1982 World Cups were chosen in London, England on 6 July 1966 by the FIFA Congress. Spain and West Germany, both facing each other in the running for hosting duties for the 1974 and 1982 World Cups, agreed to give one another a hosting job. Germany withdrew from the 1982 bidding process while Spain withdrew from the 1974 bidding process, essentially guaranteeing each a hosting spot. Mexico, who had won the 1970 hosting bid over Argentina just two years prior, agreed to withdraw and let Argentina take the 1978 hosting position.\n1986 FIFA World Cup.\nBid:\nHost voting, handled by the then-FIFA Executive Committee (or \"Exco\"), met in Stockholm, Sweden on 9 June 1974 and ratified the unopposed Colombian bid.\nResult:\nHowever, Colombia withdrew due to financial reasons on 5 November 1982, less than four years before the event was to start. \nA call for bids was sent out again, and FIFA received intent from three nations:\nIn Zürich on 20 May 1983, Mexico won the bidding unanimously as voted by the executive committee, for the first time in FIFA World Cup bidding history (excluding nations who bid unopposed).\nResults:\n1990 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nExcept Italy and the Soviet Union, all nations withdrew before the vote, which was to be conducted by Exco in Zürich on 19 May 1984. Once again, only one round of voting was required, as Italy won more votes than the Soviet Union.\nResults:\n1994 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nDespite having three nations bidding, voting only took one round. The vote was held in Zürich (for the third straight time) on 4 July 1988. The United States gained a majority of votes of the Exco members.\nResults:\n1998 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nThis vote was held in Zürich for the fourth straight time on 1 July 1992. Only one round of voting was required to have France assume the hosting job over Morocco.\nResult:\n2002 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nOn 31 May 1996, the hosting selection meeting was held in Zürich for the fifth straight time. A joint bid was formed between Japan and South Korea, and the bid was \"voted by acclamation\", an oral vote without ballots. The first joint bid of the World Cup was approved, edging out Mexico.\nResults:\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup was co-hosted in Asia for the first time by South Korea and Japan (the opening match was held in South Korea and the final was held in Japan). Initially, the two Asian countries were competitors in the bidding process. But just before the vote, they agreed with FIFA to co-host the event. However, the rivalry and distance between them led to organizational and logistical problems. FIFA has said that co-hosting is not likely to happen again, and in 2004 officially stated that its statutes did not allow co-hosting bids. This policy has since been overturned as the 2026 World Cup will be hosted jointly by the United States, Mexico, and Canada.\n2006 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nOn 6 July 2000, the host selection meeting was held for the sixth straight time in Zürich. On 4 July 2000, Brazil withdrew its bid before the vote, and the field was narrowed to four. This was the first selection in which more than one vote round was required. Three rounds of votes were eventually needed. Germany was at least tied for first in each of the three votes, and ended up defeating South Africa by only one vote after an abstention (see below).\nControversy.\nThe controversy over the decision to award the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany led to a further change in practice. The final tally was 12 votes to 11 in favour of Germany over the contenders South Africa, who had been favorites to win. New Zealand FIFA member Charlie Dempsey, who was instructed to vote for South Africa by the Oceania Football Confederation, abstained from voting at the last minute. If he had voted for the South African bid, the tally would have been 12–12, giving the decision to FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who, it was widely believed, would then have voted for South Africa.\nDempsey was among eight members of the executive committee to receive a fax by editors of the German satirical magazine \"Titanic\" on Wednesday, the night before the vote, promising a cuckoo clock and Black Forest ham in exchange for voting for Germany. He argued that the pressure from all sides including \"an attempt to bribe\" him had become too much for him.\nOn 4 August 2000, consequently, FIFA decided to rotate the hosting of the final tournaments between its constituent confederations. This was until October 2007, during the selection of the host for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, when they announced that they will no longer continue with their continental rotation policy (see below).\n2010 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nThe first World Cup bidding process under continental rotation (the process of rotating hosting of the World Cup to each confederation in turn) was the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the first World Cup to be held in Africa. On 7 July 2001, during the FIFA Congress in Buenos Aires, a decision was ratified, which was that the rotation will begin in Africa. On 23 September 2002, FIFA's executive committee confirmed that only African member associations, would be invited to submit bids to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn January 2003, Nigeria entered the bidding process, but withdrew their bid in September. In March 2003, Sepp Blatter initially said Nigeria's plan to co host the 2010 FIFA World Cup with four African countries would not work. Nigeria had originally hoped to bid jointly with West African neighbours Benin, Ghana, and Togo.\nAfter it was confirmed by FIFA that joint bidding would not be allowed in the future, Libya and Tunisia withdrew both of their bids on 8 May 2004. On 15 May 2004 in Zürich (the seventh consecutive time that a host selection has been made there), South Africa, after a narrow loss in the 2006 bidding, defeated perennial candidate Morocco to host, 14 votes to 10. Egypt received no votes.\nControversy.\nOn 28 May 2015, media covering the 2015 FIFA corruption case reported that high-ranking officials from the South African bid committee had secured the right to host the World Cup by paying US$10 million in bribes to then-FIFA Vice President Jack Warner and to other FIFA Executive Committee members.\nOn 4 June 2015, FIFA executive Chuck Blazer, having co-operated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Swiss authorities, confirmed that he and the other members of FIFA's executive committee were bribed in order to promote the South African 1998 and 2010 World Cups. Blazer stated, \"I and others on the FIFA executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup.\"\nOn 6 June 2015, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that Morocco had received the most votes, but South Africa was awarded the tournament instead.\n2014 FIFA World Cup.\nBids:\nFIFA continued its continental rotation procedure by earmarking the 2014 World Cup for South America. FIFA initially indicated that it might back out of the rotation concept, but later decided to continue it through the 2014 host decision, after which it was dropped.\nColombia had expressed interest in hosting the 2014 World Cup, but withdrew, undertaking the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Brazil also expressed interest in hosting the World Cup. CONMEBOL, the South American Football Federation, indicated their preference for Brazil as a host. Brazil was the only nation to submit a formal bid when the official bidding procedure for CONMEBOL member associations was opened in December 2006, as by that time, Colombia, Chile and Argentina had already withdrawn, and Venezuela was not allowed to bid.\nBrazil made the first unopposed bid since the initial selection of the 1986 FIFA World Cup (when Colombia was selected as host, but later withdrew for financial problems). The FIFA Executive Committee confirmed it as the host country on 30 October 2007 by a unanimous decision.\nResult:\n2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups.\n2018 Bids:\n2022 Bids:\nFIFA announced on 29 October 2007 that it will no longer continue with its continental rotation policy, implemented after the 2006 World Cup host selection. The newest host selection policy is that any country may bid for a World Cup, provided that their continental confederation has not hosted either of the past two World Cups. For the 2018 World Cup bidding process, this meant that bids from Africa and South America were not allowed.\nFor the 2022 World Cup bidding process, this meant that bids from South America and Europe were not allowed. Also, FIFA formally allowed joint bids once more (after they were banned in 2002), because there was only one organizing committee per joint bid, unlike Korea–Japan, which had two different organizing committees. Countries that announced their interest included Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Qatar, Russia, South Korea, United States, the joint bid of Spain and Portugal and the joint bid of Belgium and Netherlands.\nThe hosts for both World Cups were announced by the FIFA Executive Committee on 2 December 2010. Russia was selected to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, making it the first time that the World Cup will be hosted in Eastern Europe and making it the biggest country geographically to host the World Cup. Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, making it the first time a World Cup will be held in the Arab World and the second time in Asia since the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. Also, the decision made it the smallest country geographically to host the World Cup. The event was hosted across five cities in Qatar: Lusail, Al Khor, Al Rayyan, Al Wakrah and Doha.\n2026 FIFA World Cup.\nUnder FIFA rules as of 2016, the 2026 Cup could not be in either Europe (UEFA) or Asia (AFC), leaving an African (CAF) bid, a North American (CONCACAF) bid, a South American (CONMEBOL) bid or an Oceanian (OFC) bid as other possible options. In March 2017, FIFA's president Gianni Infantino confirmed that \"Europe (UEFA) and Asia (AFC) had been excluded from the bidding following the selection of Russia and Qatar in 2018 and 2022 respectively.\"\nThe bidding process was originally scheduled to start in 2015, with the appointment of hosts scheduled for the FIFA Congress on 10 May 2017 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On 10 June 2015, FIFA announced that the bid process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup was postponed. However, following the FIFA Council meeting on 10 May 2016, a new bid schedule was announced for May 2020 as the last in a four-phase process.\nOn 14 October 2016, FIFA said it would accept a tournament-sharing bid by CONCACAF members Canada, Mexico and the United States.\nOn 10 April 2017, Canada, the United States, and Mexico announced their intention to submit a joint bid to co-host, with three-quarters of the games to be played in the U.S., including the final.\nOn 11 August 2017, Morocco officially announced a bid to host.\nTherefore, the official 2026 FIFA World Cup bids were from two football confederations. The first one was from CONCACAF, which was triple bid by Canada, United States and Mexico, and the second one was from CAF with a bid by Morocco.\nThe host was announced on 13 June 2018 at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow, Russia. The United Bid from Canada, Mexico and the United States was selected over the Morocco bid by 134 votes to 65 with 1 selecting neither and 3 abstentions. This will be the first World Cup to be hosted by more than two countries. Mexico becomes the first country to host three men's World Cups and its Estadio Azteca will become the first stadium to stage three World Cup tournaments. On the other hand, Canada becomes the fifth country to host both the men's and women's World Cups, after Sweden (Men's: 1958/Women's: 1995), United States (Men's: 1994/Women's: 1999, 2003), Germany (Men's: 1974, 2006/Women's: 2011), and France (Men's: 1938, 1998/Women's: 2019). The United States becomes the first country to host both men's and women's World Cup twice each.\n2030 FIFA World Cup.\nThe first proposed bid was a collective bid by the members of the Argentine Football Association and Uruguayan Football Association into a proposed joint bid from Uruguay and Argentina. The second bid was a proposed bid by The Football Association of England. Under FIFA rules as of 2017 that prohibit the previous two confederations hosting the next world Cup, the 2030 World Cup cannot be held in Asia (AFC) because the Asian Football Confederation is excluded from the bidding following the selection of Qatar in 2022, nor in North America because the CONCACAF countries of the United States, Canada and Mexico will host the 2026 World Cup. Also in June 2017, UEFA's president Aleksander Čeferin stated that Europe (UEFA) will definitely fight for its right to host the 2030 World Cup.\nThe Uruguay–Argentina proposed bid would not coincide with the centennial anniversary of the first FIFA World Cup final, and the bicentennial of the first Constitution of Uruguay, but if selected the tournament dates would coincide. The Uruguay-Argentina bid was officially confirmed on 29 July 2017. A joint bid was announced by the Argentine Football Association and the Uruguayan Football Association on 29 July 2017. Before Uruguay and Argentina played out a goalless draw in Montevideo, FC Barcelona players Luis Suárez and Lionel Messi promoted the bid with commemorative shirts. On 31 August 2017, it was suggested Paraguay would join as a third host. CONMEBOL, the South American confederation, confirmed the joint three-way bid in September 2017.\nEnglish FA vice chairman David Gill has proposed that his country could bid for 2030, provided the bidding process is made more transparent. \"England is one of few countries that could stage even a 48-nation event in its entirety, while Football Association chief executive Martin Glenn made it clear earlier this year bidding for 2030 was an option.\" In June 2017, UEFA stated that \"it would support a pan-British bid for 2030 or even a single bid from England.\" On 15 July 2018, Deputy Leader of the UK Labour Party, Tom Watson, said in an interview that he and his party backed a 2030 World Cup bid for the UK saying that \"I hope it's one of the first things a Labour government does, which is work with our FA to try and put a World Cup bid together.\" On 16 July 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May expressed her support of the bid and her openness about discussions with football authorities. Although there had been no prior discussion with the Football Association, the Scottish FA also expressed its interest about joining a Home Nations bid. Former Scottish First Minister Henry McLeish has called the Scottish government and the Scottish Football Association to bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup with the other British nations.\nOn 17 June 2018, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation announced its co-bidding for the 2030 World Cup. The possibility for a joint bid with Tunisia and Algeria was raised.\nOn 17 June 2018, the English Football Association announced that they are in talks with home nations over a UK-wide bid to host the 2030 World Cup. On 1 August 2018, it was reported that the FA was preparing a bid for England to host the World Cup in 2030. A decision is expected to be made in 2019, after the FA has conducted feasibility work on a potential bid. The Scottish Football Association considered the potential British bid as a great opportunity to get funds to renovate and redevelop Hampden Park in Glasgow, the Scotland national football team's home stadium. On 4 September 2018, it was announced that the Republic of Ireland was in talks exploring the possibility to join 2030 the World Cup bid.\nOn 10 July 2018, Egypt's Sports Minister expressed interest in bidding.\nCameroonian presidential candidate Joshua Osih's political program included nominating his country along with two sub-Saharan African countries to host the 2030 World Cup, according to Cameroonian channel CRTV.\nOn 12 September 2018, Prime Minister of Spain Pedro Sánchez discussed the possibility for Spain to bid with FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Royal Spanish Football Federation President Luis Rubiales. On 8 June 2019, Spain and Portugal expressed interest in co-hosting the 2030 FIFA World Cup.\nOn 2 November 2018, Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borisov stated that his Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras had proposed a joint bid by Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia and Greece during the Balkan Four meeting in Varna. At the meeting of the Ministers of Youth and Sports of Serbia, Vanja Udovičić, Bulgaria's Krasen Kralev, Romania's Constantin Bogdan Matei and Deputy Minister of Culture and Sports of Greece, Giorgos Vasileiadis, it was officially confirmed that these four countries would submit a joint candidacy for the organization of the 2028 UEFA European Football Championship and the 2030 World Cup.\nOn 15 January 2019 FIFA president Gianni Infantino supported the Morocco, Portugal and Spain bid to host the 2030 World Cup, dealing a blow for England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales' hope, though it was still \"very early\" to speak of it.\nChile confirmed their bid to host with the group on 14 February 2019 as a joint communique from the confirmed nations joining Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.\nOn 4 October 2023 it was announced that Spain, Portugal and Morocco would host the majority of the 2030 FIFA World Cup in a unanimous decision from the FIFA Council, with one \"celebratory game\" each being held in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay.\n2034 FIFA World Cup.\nThe bidding process for the 2034 World Cup began on 4 October 2023 and is set to use the same requirements as the 2030 World Cup. Due to FIFA's confederation rotation policy, only member associations from the Asian Football Confederation and Oceania Football Confederation are eligible to host. The deadline for confirmed interest from bidding associations is 31 October, 25 days after the bidding requirements were announced.\nThe first bid for the 2034 FIFA World Cup has been proposed as a collective bid by the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \nThe idea of a combined ASEAN bid had been mooted as early as January 2011, when the former Football Association of Singapore President, Zainudin Nordin, said in a statement that the proposal had been made at an ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting, despite the fact that countries cannot bid directly - this is up to national associations. In 2013, Nordin and Special Olympics Malaysia President, Datuk Mohamed Feisol Hassan, recalled the idea for ASEAN to jointly host a World Cup.\nUnder FIFA rules as of 2017, the 2030 World Cup cannot be held in Asia (AFC) as Asian Football Confederation members are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Qatar in 2022. Therefore, the earliest bid by an AFC member could be made for 2034.\nLater, Malaysia withdrew from involvement, but Singapore and other ASEAN countries continued the campaign to submit a joint bid for the World Cup in 2034. In February 2017, ASEAN held talks on launching a joint bid during a visit by FIFA President Gianni Infantino to Yangon, Myanmar. On 1 July 2017, Vice General Chairman of the Football Association of Indonesia Joko Driyono said that Indonesia and Thailand were set to lead a consortium of Southeast Asian nations in the bid. Driyono added that due to geographical and infrastructure considerations and the expanded format (48 teams), at least two or three ASEAN countries combined would be in a position necessary to host matches.\nIn September 2017, the Thai League 1 Deputy CEO Benjamin Tan, at the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Council meeting, confirmed that his Association has \"put in their interest to bid and co-host\" the 2034 World Cup with Indonesia. On the same occasion, the General Secretary of the AFF, Dato Sri Azzuddin Ahmad, confirmed that Indonesia and Thailand will submit a joint bid. Indonesia is the only Southeast Asian country to have participated in the World Cup, when the territory was known as the Dutch East Indies.\nHowever, in June 2018, FIFA executive committee member and crown prince and regent of Pahang, Tengku Abdullah who is also the former President of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) expressed interest in joining the three countries in hosting the World Cup together. The four countries have jointly hosted a football event before during the 2007 AFC Asian Cup: if the FAM agrees to rejoin the project, they would be the first to submit a four-country joint bid in the FIFA World Cup history.\nThe second bid is from Egypt. Its Sports and Youth Minister Ashraf Sobhy said that Egypt has considered a bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup. Such a bid should be prepared by the national football association rather than the country. This bid was abandoned when Morocco was announced to cohost the 2030 World Cup.\nAfter its failed bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Australia has considered a joint bid with neighbouring New Zealand, an OFC member with which they co-hosted the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. Australia re-established this intention in August 2021, shortly after Brisbane's success in bidding to host the 2032 Summer Olympics. A joint bid with Indonesia and other ASEAN nations instead of New Zealand was also discussed by Football Australia. However, Indonesia has remained reluctant to the joint bid with Australia, considering the country is also taking part in the ASEAN bid for the same competition. An alternative suggestion is for Australia and New Zealand to partner alongside Malaysia and Singapore, instead of Indonesia even though both countries are also involved in the ASEAN bid as well.\nFootball Australia chief executive, James Johnson, said his organisation is \"exploring the possibility\" following FIFA's deadline for bids to be submitted by 31 October 2023. A major challenge to the bid however has been the need to construct more stadiums or expanded current stadiums to FIFA standards. Indonesia was in talks with Australia, Singapore, and Malaysia with a joint bid, though they pulled out on 18 October, backing the Saudi bid instead like much of the AFC. On 31 October, Football Australia put out a statement saying that they had decided against bidding, leaving Saudi Arabia as the sole bid.\nAfter Saudi Arabia abandoned its 2030 bid alongside Greece and Egypt, they switched their focus to a solo 2034 bid. If the bid is successful, similar strategies to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar may be used to mitigate the country's summer heat, though they have insisted on a plan to host in the summer. The country's bid was announced on 4 October 2023. On 5 October, AFC President Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa backed Saudi Arabia's bid. On the 9th, Saudi Arabia announced that it had submitted the official letter of intent, and signed the declaration to FIFA to bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup. Less than 72 hours after SAFF declared its intention to bid FIFA World Cup, over 100 FIFA Member Associations from across different continents have publicly pledged their support for the Kingdom.\nAbandoned bids:\n2038 FIFA World Cup.\nThe bidding process for this World Cup has yet to start, nor has any information come out about how the bidding process will work. However, if FIFA's confederation exclusion process is still used for 2038, it is likely only North America and/or Oceania are allowed to host; South America, Europe and Africa can't bid due to the agreement to host the 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco with celebratory games in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, while Asia will host the 2034 World Cup.\nIt has been suggested by many Australians online that Australia could bypass the rotation rule in 2038 by co-hosting the World Cup with New Zealand similar to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup and/or other OFC nations, though this is unlikely unless the AFC were to split or Australia were to return to the OFC prior to bidding. However, with much of the OFC outside of New Zealand lacking the resources to host such a large tournament (New Zealand itself having very few FIFA approved stadiums) and much of CONCACAF having a similar problem, some have suggested that the 2026 FIFA World Cup hosts (United States, Canada, Mexico) might host again either together or separately, possibly making Mexico the first country to host the tournament four times, and/or the United States the second country to host the World Cup three times.\nTotal bids by country.\nWorld Cup-winning bids are bolded. Withdrawn bids are \"italicized\". Rejected bids, as well as planned but not-yet-official bids for 2030 and beyond, are not included.\nHost country performances.\nExcept in 1934, when Italy had to qualify for the main tournament, host nations have always been granted automatic spots in the World Cup.\nIt is widely considered that home advantage is a benefit in the World Cup, with the host team usually performing above average. In 13 of the 22 tournaments a host country has reached the last 4. Of the 8 teams that have won the tournament, all except Brazil and Spain have been champions while hosting, with England winning its only title as hosts. Further, Sweden got to its only final on home soil. Chile and South Korea had their only semi-final finishes at home, and Mexico (twice) and an independent Russia achieved their only finishes in the top eight while hosting. South Africa and Qatar are the only hosts to not go past the first round. "

        "text": "Foxy boxing is a form of sports entertainment which involves two or more women boxing (or pretending to do so) in a sexualized context as a form of erotic entertainment. The participants are typically dressed in revealing clothing such as bikinis or skintight leotards, while the actual fight usually focuses on the beauty of the combatants rather than fighting skills. Foxy boxing is unusual in that the audience generally does not care who wins. It is believed to have its roots in \"singles' bars in southern California\" after the interest in women's boxing began to decline in the late 1980s.\nThe mainstream competitive sport of women's boxing has tried to avoid association with foxy boxing but the successful female boxer Mia St. John emphasised her sexuality by appearing on the cover of \"Playboy\" magazine.\nIt was a popular entertainment used in the Philippines for military men in the 1980s and 1990s. It included both boxing and wrestling and the women were expected to \"draw blood and show bruises before they got paid\". Foxy boxing was also utilized by bar owners in Thailand for the same type of audience.\nThe style of fighting was formed into a new genre by David Borden, into what came to be known as Kaiju Big Battel, which was staged fights with a heavy tokusatsu and pop culture influence.\nAlthough foxy boxing is more of an entertainment spectacle than a sport, it has resulted in injuries. A foxy boxer at a high-end strip club in Rhode Island sued her employer after her silicone breast implants were ruptured in a fight. The class action suit ruled her employer liable.\nMedia and popular culture.\nThe sport is frequently referenced in popular culture:"

        "title": "Sailing to Byzantium",
        "text": "\"Sailing to Byzantium\" is a poem by William Butler Yeats, first published in the 1927 reprint of \"Stories of Red Hanrahan and the Secret Rose\", and then in the 1928 collection \"The Tower\". It comprises four stanzas in ottava rima, each made up of eight lines of iambic pentameter. It uses a journey to Byzantium (Constantinople) as a metaphor for a spiritual journey. Yeats explores his thoughts and musings on how immortality, art, and the human spirit may converge. Through the use of various poetic techniques, Yeats's \"Sailing to Byzantium\" describes the metaphorical journey of a man pursuing his own vision of eternal life as well as his conception of paradise.\nSynopsis.\nWritten in 1926 (when Yeats was 60 or 61), \"Sailing to Byzantium\" is Yeats' definitive statement about the agony of old age and the imaginative and spiritual work required to remain a vital individual even when the heart is \"fastened to a dying animal\" (the body). Yeats's solution is to leave the country of the young and travel to Byzantium, where the sages in the city's famous gold mosaics could become the \"singing-masters\" of his soul. He hopes the sages will appear in fire and take him away from his body into an existence outside time, where, like a great work of art, he could exist in \"the artifice of eternity.\" This is a reference to the legend that when the Turks entered the church (Hagia Sophia) in 1453, the priests who were singing the Divine Liturgy took up the sacred vessels and disappeared into the wall of the church, where they will stay and only come out when the church is returned to Christendom (see Timothy Gregory, \"A History of Byzantium\", page 337). In the final stanza of the poem, he declares that once he is out of his body he will never again appear in the form of a natural thing; rather, he will become a golden bird, sitting on a golden tree, singing of the past (\"what is past\"), the present (that which is \"passing\"), and the future (that which is \"to come\").\nThe Golden Bough is a reference to the \"Aeneid\", book VI, by the Roman poet Virgil (70–19 BC), where it is offered as a gift by Trojan hero Aeneas to Proserpina to enter the gate of the underworld. Aeneas' father Anchises describes the spirit inside every body\nThe seeds of life—\nfiery is their force, divine their birth, but they\nare weighed down by the bodies' ills or dulled\nby earthly limbs and flesh that's born for death.\nThat is the source of all men's fears and longings,\njoys and sorrows, nor can they see the heavens' light,\nshut up in the body's tomb, a prison dark and deep.\n(\"Aeneid\" VI:843-848) \nThis describes the tension between physicality and spirituality, mortality and immortality, which are the themes of this poem.\nInterpretation.\nYeats wrote in a draft script for a 1931 BBC broadcast:\nI am trying to write about the state of my soul, for it is right for an old man to make his soul, and some of my thoughts about that subject I have put into a poem called 'Sailing to Byzantium'. When Irishmen were illuminating the Book of Kells, and making the jeweled croziers in the National Museum, Byzantium was the centre of European civilization and the source of its spiritual philosophy, so I symbolize the search for the spiritual life by a journey to that city.\nJohn Crowe Ransom comments: \"The prayer is addressed to holy sages who dwell I know not where; it does not seem to matter where, for they seem qualified to receive the prayer, and it is a qualified and dignified prayer.\"\nEpifanio San Juan writes that the action of the poem \"occurs in the tension between memory and desire, knowledge and intuition, nature and history, subsumed within a vision of eternal order\".\nCleanth Brooks asks whether, in this poem, Yeats chooses idealism or materialism and answers his own question, \"Yeats chooses both and neither. One cannot know the world of being save through the world of becoming (though one must remember that the world of becoming is a meaningless flux aside from the world of being which it implies)\".\nInfluence.\nA second poem written by W. B. Yeats, \"Byzantium\", extends and complements \"Sailing to Byzantium\". It blends descriptions of the medieval city in nighttime darkness with spiritual, supernatural and artistic imagery.\nThe short story \"No Country for Old Men\" by Irish author Seán Ó Faoláin, about two veterans of the Irish War of Independence struggling to find their place in the Irish Republic of the 1950s, takes its title from the first line of the poem. His daughter, author Julia O'Faolain, added her own twist when she titled her Booker-nominated 1980 novel \"No Country for Young Men\".\nAn espionage novel by Alan Schwartz, No Country for Old Men (New York: New American Library, 1980) follows three main characters from New York to Washington, Paris, Buenos Aires and Santiago, through a labyrinth of multinational power and international corruption, where rules and stakes shift constantly and adversaries wear many masks. .\nA science fiction novella by the same name by Robert Silverberg was published in 1985. The story, like the poem, deals with immortality and includes quotations from the poem.\nOscar-winning film director Michael Cimino (who was an avid reader of Yeats), wrote an unpublished novel named after the poem.\nPhilip Roth's 2001 short novel \"The Dying Animal\" takes its title from the third stanza, and is explicitly referenced in the text.\nCanadian author Guy Gavriel Kay's historical fantasy duology \"The Sarantine Mosaic\" was inspired by this poem.\nA song on Lisa Gerrard and Patrick Cassidy's 2004 album \"Immortal Memory\" was named after the poem.\nThe title of the 2005 novel \"No Country for Old Men\" by Cormac McCarthy and the 2007 Oscar-winning film adapted from it, comes from the first line of this poem.\nIn the 2020 video game \"Cyberpunk 2077\" by CD Projekt Red, the last verse of “Sailing to Byzantium” is recited by the A.I. Alt Cunningham during the “Changes” quest."

He played for the Boston Bruins and the Atlanta Thrashers/Winnipeg Jets of the National Hockey League (NHL) and Adler Mannheim in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). He was drafted by the Boston Bruins 21st overall in the first round of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. He is the younger brother of former NHL forward, Colin and defenseman Mike, and is the son of Mayo Clinic physician Michael Stuart.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nStuart attended Colorado College in Colorado Springs for three years prior to going pro. Stuart likely would have left a year earlier had the NHL not been involved in a lockout. During his junior year, Stuart was the captain of the Tigers and led them to the NCAA Frozen Four, where they lost to eventual champion and in-state rival, the University of Denver.\nProfessional.\nOn November 7, 2006, after undergoing off-season knee surgery, Stuart was sent down to the Boston Bruins' American Hockey League affiliate, the Providence Bruins for conditioning purposes until he was recalled by Boston on November 20, 2006. After the conclusion of the 2007–08 Boston Bruins season, Mark Stuart was also selected to play in the 2008 IIHF World Ice Hockey Championships as a member of Team USA. Also, as of April 26, 2008 Stuart was named to be one of the alternate captains for Team USA in the 2008 international event.\nOn February 18, 2011, Stuart was traded by Boston to the Atlanta Thrashers along with Blake Wheeler for Rich Peverley and Boris Valabik. Ten days later, the team signed him to a three-year deal worth $5.1 million. In 2011, Stuart's rights where transferred in the relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers to the Winnipeg Jets. During the 2012 NHL lockout, Stuart signed on to play for the Florida Everblades of the ECHL.

        "text": "Craig Peter Anderson (born May 21, 1981) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played for the Chicago Blackhawks, Florida Panthers, Colorado Avalanche, Ottawa Senators, Washington Capitals, and Buffalo Sabres, with the Senators being his longest-tenured team. Internationally, Anderson represented the United States on multiple occasions. He is one of 39 NHL goaltenders to have won over 300 games in their career.\nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nAs a youth, Anderson played in the 1994 and 1995 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with the Chicago Freeze a junior ice hockey team from Chicago.\nGuelph Storm.\nAnderson finished the 1998–99 season with the Guelph Storm of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), where he served as a backup to Chris Madden. In 21 games with the Storm, Anderson went 12–5–1 with a 3.10 GAA, helping the Storm reach the playoffs. In three playoff games for Guelph, Anderson went 0–2 with a 4.74 GAA. After the season, Anderson was drafted by the Calgary Flames in the third round, 77th overall, in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft.\nHe returned to the Storm for the 1999–2000 season, where he split the goaltending duties with Madden once again. In 38 games, Anderson had a 12–17–5 record with a 3.59 GAA. The Storm reached the playoffs, and in three games, Anderson went 0–1 with a 2.73 GAA and a .931 save percentage.\nIn 2000–01, Anderson became the starter for the Storm, as he appeared in 59 games, earning a record of 30–19–9 with a 2.63 GAA along with a .918 save percentage to win the OHL Goaltender of the Year award. In the playoffs, Anderson and the Storm struggled, as he went 0–4 with 4.25 GAA as Guelph was swept in the first round. Anderson then re-entered the NHL Entry Draft for 2001, as he failed to sign a contract with the Calgary Flames, who drafted him in 1999. The Chicago Blackhawks drafted Anderson in the third round, 73rd overall.\nDuring his tenure with Guelph, Anderson was known as \"Craig Andersson\". In an interview with Sportsnet in 2011, Anderson admitted he added an extra s to his surname following a tournament in Sweden, in which he said was to serve as a memento to his time in the country.\nUpon being drafted by the Calgary Flames in 1999, he was recognized in the team's official records as Craig Andersson, despite the fact it wasn't actually his legal surname. Anderson was forced to abandon the practice of using the extra letter upon signing his first professional contract with the Chicago Blackhawks.\nProfessional career.\nChicago Blackhawks (2001–2006).\nThe Chicago Blackhawks assigned Anderson to the Norfolk Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL) for the 2001–02, where he served as a backup to Michael Leighton. In 28 games with the Admirals, Anderson went 9–13–4 with a 2.86 GAA. He then played in a playoff game for the team, going 0–1 with a 2.86 GAA and .938 save percentage in 21 minutes of work.\nAnderson spent the majority of the 2002–03 season with the Admirals, going 15–11–4 with a 1.94 GAA in 32 games with Norfolk. In the playoffs, he went 2–3 with a 2.61 GAA in five games. Anderson also made his NHL debut in 2002–03 with the Chicago Blackhawks. In his first NHL game on November 30, 2002, Anderson stopped all four shots he faced after replacing Jocelyn Thibault in the second period in a 4–1 loss to the Los Angeles Kings. Anderson then started his first NHL game the next night, on December 1, 2002, against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, where he made 23 saves in a 3–2 loss. Anderson finished the year 0–3–2 with the Blackhawks with a 4.00 GAA in six games with Chicago.\nAnderson again split the 2003–04 season between the Admirals and Blackhawks. In 37 games with Norfolk, Anderson had a 17–20–0 record with a 2.11 GAA, followed by a 2–3 record and a 1.83 GAA in the playoffs. With the Blackhawks in 2003–04, Anderson went 6–14–0 with a 2.84 GAA in 21 games. After losing his first eight decisions with the team, Anderson won his first NHL game, and earned his first NHL shutout, as he made 30 saves in a 7–0 Blackhawks victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets on January 22, 2004.\nWith the 2004–05 NHL lockout cancelling the season, Anderson spent the entire season with Norfolk. Injuries, however, limited Anderson to only 15 games, where he had a 9–4–1 record and a 1.83 GAA for the Admirals. In six playoff games, Anderson was 2–4 with a 2.36 GAA.\nAnderson spent the entire 2005–06 in the NHL, though he found himself claimed on the waiver wire three times. On January 19, 2006, the Boston Bruins claimed Anderson from the Blackhawks, then on January 31, the St. Louis Blues claimed Anderson from the Bruins. Four days later, on February 3, the Blackhawks claimed Anderson from the Blues. Despite all the movement, Anderson did not appear in any games with the Bruins or Blues. In 29 games with the Blackhawks as the primary backup to Nikolai Khabibulin, Anderson went 6–12–4 with a 3.32 GAA. On June 24, the Blackhawks traded Anderson to the Florida Panthers for the Panthers sixth round draft pick in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft.\nFlorida Panthers (2006–2009).\nAnderson spent most of the 2006–07 season with the Florida Panthers' AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans. In 34 games with Rochester, Anderson went 23–10–1 with a 2.56 GAA, then went 2–4 with a 2.87 GAA in six playoff games. Anderson also appeared in five NHL games with the Panthers in 2006–07, going 1–1–1 with a 2.21 GAA. He earned his first win as a Panther on March 28, 2007, as he made 33 saves in a 3–2 shootout victory over the Atlanta Thrashers.\nIn 2007–08, Anderson stayed with the Panthers for the entire season, as he was the backup goaltender to Tomáš Vokoun. In 17 games, Anderson went 8–6–1 with a 2.25 GAA and an impressive .935 save percentage. Anderson set an NHL record for the most saves in a shutout, as he stopped all 53 shots he faced in a 1–0 win over the New York Islanders on March 2, 2008. Anderson then had 40 saves in his next game, also a shutout victory, as Florida defeated the Boston Bruins 1–0 in overtime on March 4, 2008. That also set an NHL record for most saves in consecutive shutouts, with 93. Anderson's record of 53 saves in a single shutout, however, was broken when Mike Smith of the Phoenix Coyotes made a 54-save shutout against the Columbus Blue Jackets on April 3, 2012.\nAnderson was the backup once again to Vokoun in 2008–09. He appeared in 31 games, however, due to an injury Vokoun suffered during the season. Anderson went 15–7–5 with a 2.71 GAA, as Florida narrowly missed the playoffs. After the season, Anderson became a free agent, and on July 1, 2009, he signed a two-year contract with the Colorado Avalanche.\nColorado Avalanche (2009–2011).\nAnderson joined the Colorado Avalanche for the 2009–10 season and won the starting job from Peter Budaj in training camp. In his first season with the Avalanche, Anderson went 38–25–7 with a 2.64 GAA, .917 save percentage and seven shutouts, helping the team make a surprising run into the playoffs. He won his first game with the Avalanche in his first start, a 5–2 Avalanche victory over the San Jose Sharks on October 1, 2009. In his next start, Anderson recorded his first shutout with the team, stopping all 35 shots in a 3–0 win over the Vancouver Canucks on October 3, 2009. Anderson became the fourth goaltender in team history to win 30 or more games, joining Patrick Roy, David Aebischer and Peter Budaj. He set the team record for consecutive starts to begin the season, as he started the first 15 games. He led the NHL in saves with 2,047 and shots against with 2,233.\nAnderson made his NHL playoff debut on April 14, 2010, as he made 25 saves in a 2–1 victory over the San Jose Sharks. Four nights later, Anderson recorded his first ever post-season shutout, as he stopped all 51 shots fired at him, as Colorado won the game 1–0 in overtime. The Sharks would eventually defeat the Avalanche in six games, as Anderson had a 2–4 record with a 2.62 GAA and a .933 save percentage.\nAnderson struggled to begin the 2010–11 season with the Avalanche and eventually lost his starting job to Peter Budaj. With Colorado quickly falling out of the playoff race, and Anderson struggling with a 13–15–3 record and a 3.28 GAA, the club traded him to the Ottawa Senators for Brian Elliott on February 18, 2011.\nOttawa Senators (2011–2020).\nAnderson finished the 2010–11 season with the Ottawa Senators, going 11–5–1 in 18 games, earning a 2.05 GAA and a .939 save percentage. In his first game as a Senator, Anderson posted a 47-save performance to shut out the Toronto Maple Leafs on February 19, 2011. On March 21, Anderson signed a four-year contract extension with the club.\nDuring the 2011–12 season, Anderson was among the league leaders for wins with 29 in 56 games before being sidelined in mid-February by a right hand injury sustained in a cooking accident. The Senators then acquired minor league goalie Ben Bishop from the St. Louis Blues near the trade deadline. Later in the season, Anderson's Senators faced the Eastern Conference's top seeded New York Rangers and took the series to seven games before losing 2–1 in the final game.\nThe lockout-shortened 2012–13 season started off very well for Anderson. In his first ten games of the season, he posted a record of 6–2–2 with a 1.49 GAA and .950 save percentage, earning consideration as an early Vezina Trophy favorite. He was named the NHL's first star for the month of January (2013). Anderson, however, suffered a sprained right ankle in a game against the New York Rangers on February 21, 2013, when he was knocked down by Rangers forward Chris Kreider after Krieder was tripped by a Senators player while moving toward the goal.\nOn August 25, 2014, the Senators announced they had signed Anderson to a three-year, $12.6 million contract extension, starting in the 2015–16 season. During the 2015 playoffs, Craig Anderson took over for Andrew Hammond in the first round after Hammond lost the first two games against the Canadiens. The Senators lost to the Canadiens in six games with Anderson posting a 2–2 record despite his 0.97 goals against average and .972 save percentage.\nAnderson would miss parts of the 2016–17 season as he would take personal leave to support his wife in her battle with throat cancer. The Senators would acquire Mike Condon from the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in the 2017 draft due to both Anderson's personal leave and backup goalie Andrew Hammond being injured at the beginning of the season. Despite this, Anderson would put up his best seasonal numbers since the 2012–13 season, with a 2.26 GAA and .926 save percentage in 40 games played. On March 11, 2017, Anderson set a team record for most wins by a goaltender when he won his 147th game, breaking the previous record set by Patrick Lalime. During the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs, Anderson backed the Senators to an appearance in the Eastern Conference Final, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games. Following the season, Anderson was the recipient of the 2016–17 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to the sport of hockey. In September 2017, Anderson signed a two-year, $9.5 million contract, to begin in the 2018–19 season. \nIn June 2018, it was revealed that Anderson had quietly requested a trade from Ottawa, with his agent Justin Duberman being quoted as saying that his client \"had expressed his desire to move on from the Senators.\" By August, Anderson had seemingly changed his mind and hinted that some well-publicized discord within the Senators organization, which culminated in forward Mike Hoffman leaving the team after his girlfriend had been accused of harassing the family of All-Star defenseman Erik Karlsson, had been behind his earlier request to be moved. With Hoffman's departure, Anderson stated that he had hoped the \"drama\" had ended and he could again focus on hockey.\nOn September 23, 2020, it was announced that Anderson would not be tendered a renewal of his contract with the Senators for the forthcoming 2020–21 NHL season. Despite Anderson's desire to continue his NHL career at the time, his struggling performance over the previous three seasons and relatively old age proved too much for the Senators, who had been proceeding in a complete roster rebuild during this time. At the time of the end of Anderson's tenure with the Senators, he led all franchise goaltenders in regular season wins, playoff wins, and games played. Additionally, he ranked second in shutouts and playoff games played, behind only Patrick Lalime. After the announcement, Senators GM Pierre Dorion stated that Anderson is \"the best goalie we've ever had.\"\nWashington Capitals (2021).\nOn December 27, 2020, Anderson signed a professional tryout agreement with the Washington Capitals. On January 13, 2021, Anderson and the Capitals agreed on a one-year contract. He made his debut on February 7, against the Philadelphia Flyers, in relief for Vítek Vaněček. Anderson made his first start as a Capital on February 21, stopping 26 of 29 shots and earning his first victory with the team as Washington defeated the New Jersey Devils 4–3. On May 15, Anderson won his first playoff game since May 23, 2017, in relief of Vítek Vaněček. He made 22 saves and allowed one goal as the Capitals defeated the Boston Bruins 3–2 in overtime in Game 1 of the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nBuffalo Sabres and Ottawa Senators (2021–2023).\nOn July 28, 2021, Anderson extended his career in signing a one-year, $750,000 agreement as a free agent with the Buffalo Sabres. After a strong start, he was sidelined by a neck injury in November that caused him to miss three months of play. During the arduous rehabilitative process he briefly contemplated retiring, but continued on, partially in pursuit of his 300th win in the NHL.\nAnderson secured his 300th NHL win in a March 10, 2022 victory over the Vegas Golden Knights. He became the thirty-ninth NHL goaltender to achieve the feat, and only the sixth American. On June 30, 2022, Anderson signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract extension with Buffalo, returning for his 20th NHL season.\nOn January 23, 2023, Anderson played in his 700th NHL game in a 3–2 win against the Dallas Stars. On April 13, 2023, Anderson played in his final NHL game, with the Sabres beating the Ottawa Senators 4–3 in overtime. Following the game, Anderson announced his retirement from professional hockey. He signed a one-day contract with Ottawa to retire a Senator on October 24, 2023.\nInternational play.\nAnderson played for the United States at the 2006 IIHF World Championship held in Riga, Latvia. In five games, Anderson went 3–2–0 with a 2.36 GAA; the U.S., however, finished in seventh place. Anderson once again represented the Americans at the 2008 IIHF World Championship held in Quebec City, Quebec, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he went 0–0–0 with a 5.63 GAA in two appearances as the U.S. finished in sixth place.\nPersonal life.\nAnderson graduated from Barrington High School in 1999. He married his wife Nicholle in the summer of 2010. The couple have two sons.\nOn October 29, 2016, Nicholle Anderson was diagnosed with throat cancer. She revealed that she was cancer free in May 2017. After missing time to care for his wife and children, Anderson played a key role in Ottawa's run to the 2017 Conference Finals. On June 21, 2017, he won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, for dedication to hockey.\nAnderson has instructed goalie camps since being drafted in 2001. He currently instructs at \"Craig Anderson's Goalie School\" in Chicago during summers.\nCareer statistics.\nRegular season and playoffs.\nBolded numbers indicate season/playoff leader"

        "text": "Aaron Lindsay Johnson (born April 30, 1983) is a former Canadian professional ice hockey defenseman. Johnson last played under contract with the Sheffield Steelers in the Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL). Since 2021, he has worked as a team relations specialist for the NHL's Columbus Blue Jackets.\nHe was a third-round selection of the Columbus Blue Jackets, 85th overall, at the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. A journeyman, Johnson has played for the Blue Jackets, New York Islanders, Chicago Blackhawks, Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers and Boston Bruins in the NHL, and several minor league teams during his career. He was a member of the Memorial Cup champion Rimouski Océanic in 2000.\nPlaying career.\nJohnson played four seasons of junior hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) between 1999 and 2003. He played primarily for the Rimouski Océanic but finished his junior career with the Quebec Remparts. He had 40 goals and 195 points in 252 games as a junior. He was a member of Rimouski's President's Cup championship team that defeated the Hull Olympiques in the final. Johnson appeared in one game at the 2001 Memorial Cup tournament as Rimouski went on to win the Canadian Hockey League championship.\nThe Columbus Blue Jackets selected Johnson with their third round selection, 85th overall, at the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. He was assigned to the American Hockey League (AHL)'s Syracuse Crunch upon turning professional in 2003, but appeared in 29 games with the Blue Jackets in the 2003–04 NHL season. He made his NHL debut on December 2, 2003, against the Anaheim Ducks and earned his first NHL point with an assist two nights later against the Nashville Predators. He spent the majority of the following two seasons with the Crunch, but appeared in 26 games with Columbus in 2005–06 before earning a regular role with the team the following year, a season in which he scored three goals and 10 points in 61 games.\nJohnson left Columbus as a free agent, signing with the New York Islanders for the 2007–08 season. He appeared in 30 games for the Islanders, but missed 35 more due to a knee injury. Allowed to go again to free agency, Johnson frequently switched teams as a journeyman defenceman. He signed with the Chicago Blackhawks for 2008–09 with whom he appeared in 35 games. Chicago traded Johnson to the Calgary Flames on October 7, 2009, in exchange for Kyle Greentree. A series of injuries to Calgary's defencemen gave Johnson an opportunity to play, but he was on the move again after 22 games with the Flames.\nCalgary sent Johnson to the Edmonton Oilers, along with a draft pick, in exchange for Steve Staios on March 3, 2010. The trade was notable for being the first time the two Battle of Alberta rivals completed a trade in the Flames' 30-year history. Johnson appeared in 19 games for the Oilers and recorded seven points. Leaving the Oilers, Johnson played the entire 2010–11 season in the AHL with the Milwaukee Admirals, before returning to the Blue Jackets for the 2011–12 season where he recorded a career high 16 points in 56 games. Following a ten-game stint with the Boston Bruins in 2012–13, Johnson signed with the New York Rangers for the 2013–14 season. He was assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack and named the team captain. Hartford was the 12th different team Johnson played for in his professional career.\nOn July 3, 2014, Johnson left the Rangers organization after one season and agreed to a one-year contract as a free agent with the Ottawa Senators. He was assigned to their AHL affiliate the Binghamton Senators, where he was also named captain.\nOn September 25, 2015, Johnson, as a free agent, returned to the Calgary Flames organization, agreeing to a one-year AHL contract with affiliate, the Stockton Heat.\nOn June 17, 2016, Johnson signed his first contract overseas, a one-year contract with Adler Mannheim of the German top-tier Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). On March 17, 2017, Johnson signed a one-year contract extension with Mannheim.\nOn July 26, 2018, Johnson left Germany after two years and agreed as a free agent to a two-year deal with English club the Sheffield Steelers of the EIHL.\nJohnson was due to remain in Sheffield for the 2020-21 season as a player/assistant coach, but the campaign was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. In July 2021, Sheffield confirmed Johnson would not return to the club.\nIn October 2021, Johnson began working as a team relationship specialist for the NHL team which first drafted him, the Columbus Blue Jackets."

        "title": "Super Baseball 2020",
        "text": "Super Baseball 2020 is a futuristic baseball video game. It was first released in Japan for the Neo Geo in 1991, and then it was later released in North America for the Sega Genesis (ported by NuFX and released by Electronic Arts) and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (released by Tradewest) in 1993. The North American Genesis and European Mega Drive versions feature a package illustration by Electronic Arts artist Marc Ericksen.\nThe game follows the basic rules of baseball and gameplay from its predecessor \"Baseball Stars Professional\", but there are several upgrades since the game takes place in the then future of 2020. The most obvious difference from real baseball is that some of the characters in this game are robots. All the human characters are equipped with powerful armor, computer sensors, and jet-packs for improved offense and defensive skills.\nCyber Egg Stadium.\nApart from the futuristic characters, the field has also been revamped and redesigned for the future. There is only one stadium in this game, known as Cyber Egg Stadium. A ball hit over the outfield fence is no longer a home run unless it is hit directly over the fence in center field. The other areas of the outfield stands are covered with a protective glass that will cause the ball to bounce off of it and bounce back in play onto the field. The ball hitting this zone always comes back into the field but gives the batter enough time to take a base or two. However, slower runners can sometimes be thrown out at first base even if the ball is hit over the outfield fence.\nThe reason the home run zone was reduced is because the hitters are far more powerful and have the ability to blast the ball tremendously far. Only the most powerful hitters can have the accuracy and strength to hit the ball far enough to get a home run. The foul zone has also been reduced. It is now shorter and only encompasses the area directly behind first base through third base. Weaker batters can often get a hit by swinging early or late at the ball, causing it to just barely make the fair zone in what would otherwise be the foul zone in normal baseball.\nOther features are also present on the field. A \"stop zone\" is present just past the field behind first and third base. If the ball touches this rectangular spot, it will stop dead. However, the stop zone is small, and the ball can often bounce right over it without stopping. It can present a problem for slower runners who were hoping the ball would bounce all the way to the fence. Near the fence there are \"jump zones\", in which a player gets an extra boost in jump height to catch a ball that is otherwise going to go over the fence. In the Super NES version, the jump zone is only located in front of the home run zone to try to stop a ball that is going to be a home run. In other versions, the jump zones are placed all throughout the stadium's fences. In addition, every few innings, \"crackers\" are put on the field. Crackers are landmines that when are stepped on, sends the player sky high and leaves him shaking on the field for a few seconds, delaying the player's time to make a play. Crackers do not appear in the Super NES version.\nGameplay.\nPlayers.\nDifferent from real baseball and other baseball video games, this game consists of both male and female characters, as well as robots. All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. This can happen if the player constantly makes them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, the player can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.\nPowering up.\nOne thing that makes \"2020 Super Baseball\" different from other games is the ability to power-up any character. During the game, players can earn money doing certain things, ranging from throwing a strike ($100) to hitting a grand slam ($10,000). Players can earn money both on defense and offense, and the money earned gets saved for use at any time during the game. Money does not get carried over to the next game, so it is wise to use it all before the game's end. Money can be deducted during the game, in the event that the player's team gets out. However, earning money is far easier than losing money. $10 can be lost for every strike thrown against the player and up to $100 for being put out.\nAt any point in the game, as long as the player has enough money, it can be spent on upgrading players. For human players, the player can upgrade three different abilities: hitting, fielding, and pitching. Upgrading hitting power will allow the player's character to hit the ball farther; fielding power will allow them to run and throw the ball faster when on defense, and pitching upgrades (used only for pitchers) will allow a player to pitch the ball faster and more accurate. Robots can only be upgraded to more powerful robots, and human players can also be upgraded to robots. When upgrading to a robot, the character is actually replaced with a more powerful robot that glows with power.\nFor all four categories of upgrades, there are three different levels of upgrade that can be purchased, known as A, B, and C (C being the most powerful and expensive). Every category has different prices for their upgrades, and the upgrades offer a higher percentage of power increase. The most inexpensive upgrade is fielding A (12%) for $1,000, and the most expensive is robot C (80%) for $30,000. Keep in mind when using the robot upgrade that it powers up \"all\" attributes of a character an equal amount corresponding to the upgrade level. The power received from a non-robot upgrade for a human character adds to the character's already existing powers. Therefore, if two players, one with a hitting power of two and the other nine, both receive a hitting C upgrade, the latter will still be considerably stronger.\nAfter powering up a player, they retain that upgrade throughout the duration of the game. However, if that player gets overworked during the game, they may \"blow up\" and lose their upgrade. When human players blow up, they return to their normal state before the upgrade. Conversely, when a robot upgrade blows up, it turns into a dead robot. A dead robot turns gray and loses all its attributes, giving it a zero in all four categories (hitting, fielding, pitching, and chance). It can still be used during the game, but it is essentially a worthless player. After blowing up, an upgraded player can always be re-upgraded as long as there remains adequate money. When a player is upgraded to A, the player can also spend the money to have them further upgraded to B or C, although this means the full price for the upgrade must be paid (discounts are not offered for those having previously upgraded). A player cannot be upgraded with the same upgrade they already have until they lose their power.\nReception.\n\"RePlay\" reported \"Super Baseball 2020\" to be the third most-popular arcade game at the time. In Japan, \"Game Machine\" listed \"Super Baseball 2020\" on their November 1, 1991 issue as being the ninth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.\nOn release, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored the Neo Geo version of the game a 24 out of 40.\nIn a retrospective review, Allgame editor Kyle Knight described the Neo Geo AES version of Super Baseball 2020 as \"a lot of fun to play and a refreshing take on the game of baseball\"."

Comprising two links courses, Ballybunion was previously ranked at number seven in \"Golf Digest\"s \"100 Best Courses Outside the USA\". While, due to its remote location, the course has not been selected for many top championship events, the club's \"Old Course\" hosted the Irish Open on the European Tour in 2000.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1893, the club had barely opened its doors before experiencing financial problems. An investment in the early 20th century saved the club and nine new holes were laid out. By 1927, the course had been expanded to 18 holes.\nA number of the world's top players have played at the course, including Tom Watson who first visited Ballybunion in 1981. In 1995, Watson remodeled Ballybunion into the course that exists today.\nDuring his second term, U.S. President Bill Clinton played the course in September 1998. A statue of him with a golf club in the town of Ballybunion commemorates the visit. After leaving office, he returned in May 2001.\nThe club hosted the Murphy's Irish Open in 2000 and the Palmer Cup in 2004.\nCourses.\nBallybunion has two courses: The Old Course and The Cashen Course;"

        "title": "NSW Premier Cricket",
        "text": "NSW Premier Cricket, formerly known as Sydney Grade Cricket. is a cricket competition played in Sydney, Australia. The competition began in 1893 when a number of clubs that had been playing for many years on an ad hoc basis voted to create a formal competition structure.\nThe NSW Premier Cricket competition is generally played on Saturdays and begins in mid-September and continues until the grand final is played on the first weekend of April. Spectators are generally few and far between at matches, mostly family members, partners or club members. The exception to this is at T20 matches which can attract crowds into the hundreds and occasionally the low thousands. Players for the NSW team are selected from the first-grade competition. While modern day cricketers have few breaks outside the international calendar, when they do NSW players often return to play in the first-grade competition.\nHistory.\nThis competition has grown substantially since its formation and by 1985 the Sydney Grade Cricket Competition encompassed 20 clubs. Since the 1940s there had been a number of club mergers (Mosman with Middle Harbour, Petersham with Marrickville and Glebe with South Sydney followed in 1965 by the forced merger of Paddington with Glebe-South Sydney to form Sydney District CC). In 1965 Sutherland joined the competition, followed by Nepean (now Penrith) and University of NSW in 1973. In 1985 Sydney District CC left the competition but 3 new clubs from the outer suburbs of Sydney joined - Fairfield, Campbelltown and Hawkesbury. In the late 1990s there was a push to remove some inner-city clubs from the competition, but although no clubs were forced out, in 2001 Randwick and Petersham-Marrickville (itself the product of a merger in 1951) decided to merge and formed the Randwick Petersham club. Some clubs were renamed to reflect their wider representation (Waverley renamed as Eastern Suburbs, Fairfield becoming Fairfield-Liverpool and Campbelltown becoming Campbelltown-Camden). Finally in 2002 Blacktown were promoted from the second-tier shires competition to bring the number of clubs back up to 20. Each of the 20 clubs fields a side in each of the five senior grades as well as a side in the Poidevin-Gray Shield and AW Green Shield junior competitions.\nIn recent times some clubs have started broadcasting scorecards in real-time on the Cricket Australia website. Some clubs also have detailed video and photographs each weekend. Most but not all clubs actively update their website and have information across a variety of social media platforms.\nSydney grade cricket also has a proud history of welcoming budding, current or former first-class and Test cricketers from around the world. Players are primarily sourced from England's county competition. In 2015/16, there were over 10 players in the competition plying their trade in the first-grade competition. In the late 1990s and early 2000s Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Strauss amongst others played seasons in Sydney. Such is the strength of the competition that some well-known players have been known to play multiple matches in second grade.\nTo address shortcomings in players making the transition from first-grade to State cricket, two seasons ago a different type of ball was introduced into the first-grade competition. This ball is the same used by state players but had not previously been used due to its cost (A$150 each). While the ball is still a four-piece ball, its seam is less pronounced and more difficult to swing. Bowlers, in particular fast bowlers, have had to work much harder at getting wickets. Since its introduction scores within the competition have increased. There have been higher team and individual scores (400+ scores by teams are not the rare occurrence they once were).\nIn the 2016/17 season, the competition changed its name to NSW Premier Cricket. The name change was part of a Cricket Australia initiative to standardise the naming of the elite men's cricket competition within each state's capital city.\nCurrent Clubs.\nClubs in the 2023/24 season of NSW Premier Cricket are:\nFormer clubs.\nSydney's suburban sprawl over the past 120 years has seen the introduction of new outer-suburban clubs and the disappearance or mergers of some inner-city clubs. The most successful club no longer in the competition is Paddington which won 9 first grade titles between 1894/95 and 1953/54 before being forced to merge with Glebe-South Sydney to form the Sydney District CC in 1965 - this merged club later left the competition in 1985. Other ex-clubs include:\nNSW Premier Cricket.\nThe competition consists of 20 clubs who field one side in each of the five grades. In the 1st Grade competition, each side plays every other side over a total of 19 rounds. All other grades play only 15 rounds, thus missing out on playing 4 teams each season. The additional 4 rounds that are played by the 1st Grade sides are generally one day matches that take place on Sundays (won by Sydney University in 2010/2011).\nThe 2010/11 season, for all grades, included 10 two-day matches (generally played on two consecutive Saturdays), 4 one-day matches and 1 Twenty-20 match. The 1st Grade sides played an additional one-day match and 3 Twenty20 matches. The 1st Grade Draw can be found here and the 2nd Grade draw, which is identical to the 3rd, 4th and 5th Grade draws, can be found here .\nThe final series generally consists of Qualifying Finals, Semi-Finals and a Final. These matches are played over two days, with the First Grade Final being played over three days. In the Qualifying Finals, the 1st placed team plays the 6th placed team, 2nd plays 5th and 3rd plays 4th. The three winning teams (or better placed team in the case of a draw) and the best placed losing team go through to the Semi-Finals.\nPoints are allocated to the teams according to the results of each match. These points go towards the Club Championship which is awarded at the end of the regular season.\nAll of the current NSW first-class cricket players are selected from their performances in Premier Cricket. This includes those players who also represent Australia although the demands of the international schedule means the Australian players rarely get to play at grade level these days.\nPoidevin-Gray Shield.\nThe Poidevin-Gray Shield, or PG's as it is more commonly known, comprises teams who represent their grade sides in an Under 21 competition. All points received in this competition go towards the Club Championship.\nA W Green Shield.\nThe A W Green Shield, or Greenies as it is more commonly known, comprises teams who represent their grade sides in an Under 16 competition consisting of 7 preliminary rounds, qualifying finals, semi-finals and a Final.\nClub Championship.\nWon by the club with the highest competition points in aggregate across all 5 grades plus points from the PG and Green Shield competitions. Points are only accrued across round matches and do not include finals.\nFor each club, each grades' points tally is multiplied by a factor for the purposes of calculating Club Championship points. A point in first grade is worth more than second grade and so on. Due to this system, the winner of the Club Championship usually comes from a club whose first-grade team is within the top 6. However, consistency across the top 3 grades in particular is important.\nClub Championship Factors\nFirst grade = 6 points per competition point, Second grade = 5, Third = 4,Fourth = 3, Fifth/PG/Green Shield = 2...\nReferences.\n8.

The tournament is played on outdoor clay courts. Between 1971 and 1989 it was an event of the Grand Prix tennis circuit and is now a part of the ATP Tour schedule as an ATP Tour 250 series event.\nHistory.\nThe Swiss International Championships was founded in 1897 and staged at the Grasshopper Club, Zurich under the auspices of the Swiss Lawn Tennis Association. In 1898 the Swiss Lawn Tennis Association staged the event at Château-d'Œx. In 1899 an open women's singles event was added to the schedule, when the venue was still in Saint Moritz. It was then hosted at multiple locations throughout its run including Gstaad. The first edition of the Gstaad International tournament was played in 1915 at the \"Gstaad Palace Hotel\", which was known at the time as the \"Royal Hotel, Winter &amp; Gstaad Palace\", and was organized in collaboration with the Lawn Tennis Club (LTC) Gstaad. The first event was played on clay courts and was won by Victor de Coubasch. For the years 1937,48–49, 52, 54–55, 57–58, 60–61, 63, 66–67 this tournament was valid as the Swiss International Championships. In 1968 it became known as the Swiss Open Championships.\nThe Swiss International Championships were staged at the following locations throughout its run including Basel, Champéry, Geneva, Gstaad, Les Avants, Montreux, Lausanne, Lugano, Lucerne, Ragatz, St. Moritz, Zermatt, and Zurich from 1897 to 1967.\nGstaad is located 1,050 metres (3,450 feet) above sea level. It is the highest venue for ATP Tour events in Europe, although lower than the Ecuador Open and the former Colombia Open, both held at the Andes."
