A further eight teams qualified through regional, cross-regional tournaments and the repechage process.\nThe qualifying matches began on 5 March 2016, when Jamaica defeated Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 48–0. Symbolically, the referee for the match was Nigel Owens, who had refereed the 2015 Rugby World Cup final five months earlier.\nQualification process.\nFollowing confirmation of the twelve automatically qualified teams from the 2015 Rugby World Cup, World Rugby announced the qualification format for the eight remaining places on 12 November 2015. Of the eight berths remaining, six were decided in regional tournaments, one by a cross-regional playoff and the last one via repechage.\nA total of 79 teams from around the world were involved in some stage of qualifying. All non-automatic qualifiers were decided by November 2018.\nAfrica.\nRugby Africa was granted one place at the world cup, awarded to the winner of the Africa Cup (Africa 1). The runner-up (Africa 2) advanced to the repechage tournament. Namibia qualified while Kenya took the runner-up spot.\nAmericas.\nThe Americas, encompassing both the Rugby Americas North and Sudamérica Rugby continental regions, was awarded two world cup places for the top teams in the Americas qualification process (Americas 1 and Americas 2). A third team (Americas 3) advanced to the repechage tournament.

The runner-up (Europe 2) also had two further chances to qualify, directly via the Europe/Oceania play-off or through the repechage. Romania and Spain finished in first and second places but were deducted points for fielding ineligible players, effectively disqualifying them. As a result Russia qualified in first place. Germany, who had finished last in the group, advanced to the playoff against division two winners Portugal, which they won, thereby qualifying for a playoff against Samoa.\nOceania.\nOceania Rugby was granted two world cup places for the top teams across 2016 and 2017 in the Pacific Nations Cup (Oceania 1 and Oceania 2). The third-ranked team (Oceania 3) had two further chances to qualify, via the Europe/Oceania play-off or through the repechage. Fiji and Tonga qualified directly while Samoa advanced to a playoff against Germany.\nFinally, the top team from the Oceania Cup (Oceania 4) advanced to the Asia/Oceania playoff for a chance to play in the repechage. Tahiti defeated Cook Islands to win the Oceania Cup in 2017 but was disqualified from progressing due to fielding ineligible players so Cook Islands advanced to the playoff against Hong Kong instead.\nNotes:\n† Minus one additional team, Turkey, who withdrew prior to playing any games.\n‡ Replacing Romania, who had points deducted for fielding an ineligible player.\n§ Replacing Spain, who had points deducted for fielding ineligible players.\n‖ The Cook Islands advanced to the next stage of qualifying after Tahiti were found to have breached player eligibility regulations in their Oceania Cup clash.\nPlay-off and repechage qualification.\nFollowing the regional tournaments, the next qualification play-off was a home and away series between Germany (as Europe 2) and Samoa (as Oceania 3). Samoa won both matches and qualified for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, while Germany continued to the repechage tournament.\nThe elimination play-off was a home and away series between Hong Kong (as Asia 1) and Cook Islands (as Oceania 4). The Cook Islands team was eliminated with Hong Kong winning both matches to advance to the repechage tournament.\nFour teams took part in the repechage process for the final spot at the World Cup. Unlike previous repechages, the teams played in a round-robin tournament, where all teams played each other once. The repechage tournament was hosted at the neutral venue of the Stade Delort in Marseille, France, in November 2018.\nFinal standings (continental qualifying path and world ranking of each team before the tournament is shown in brackets):"

        "title": "Cape Breton Highlanders (basketball)",
        "text": "The Cape Breton Highlanders were a Canadian professional basketball team based in Sydney, Nova Scotia. They were granted a hiatus from the National Basketball League of Canada for the 2019–20 season, but have no schedule to return.\nHistory.\nIn early June 2015, it was announced that Tyrone Levingston, the son of Halifax Rainmen owner Andre Levingston, was making an attempt to establish a basketball team in Sydney, Nova Scotia in Cape Breton Island. He drew attention from businessman Parker Rudderham and many other locals that were willing to become a part of the team's ownership. Instead of him being the sole owner, Levingston preferred to have a group of multiple investors. By August, the team had expectations of playing their home games at Centre 200 and hoped to compete in the 2015–16 NBL Canada season.\nOn September 22, 2015, the team was officially admitted into the league for the upcoming season. Centre 200 was confirmed as their future home arena. Commissioner Dave Magley expected the league's expansion into Sydney to have positive financial ramifications. The team was also announced to be called \"Cape Breton\", with their nickname to be decided through a public contest. The nickname would be announced on October 15.\nHowever, at the time Cape Breton's nickname was expected to be released to the public, the team was put on hold for the 2015–16 season, because they were unable to \"get all the financing and other details put in place.\" Levingston said that he aimed to strike more sponsorship deals to ensure that the team would compete in the following season. Nevertheless, he planned to promote their nickname and logo as soon as possible. On November 24, 2015, the team's nickname was officially announced as the \"Cape Breton Highlanders\". It was inspired by the Cape Breton Highlanders military unit and the geography of the Cape Breton area itself. Centre 200 was the site of a 2015–16 NBL Canada preseason game between the Halifax Hurricanes and the Island Storm in order to promote the league to the new market. The Hurricanes won the game 106-103 in front of approximately 1,100 fans. On August 29, 2016, the Highlanders announced its ownership group and confirmed that the paperwork was being finalized with the league in order to join for the 2016–17 season. On October 7, the Highlanders announced its first head coach would be Dean Murray.\nCoach Murray would end up being released midway through the first season on January 22 and replaced by assistant coach Ben Resner. When the season ended, the Highlanders were last in the Atlantic Division with a 15–25 record and failed to make the playoffs. In July 2017, the Highlanders hired longtime NBLC coach Rob Spon as the head coach for the 2017–18 season. Spon left after one season and was replaced by Bernardo Fitz-Gonzalez, a former Colombia national basketball team player. Under Fitz-Gonzalez, the team qualified for the playoffs for the first time.

        "text": "In late 1977, the new World Series Cricket competition began in Australia between three teams playing both multi-day and one day games. The first set of these fixtures to be played was a three match series between the Australian team and the West Indies team, starting at the beginning of December.\nBackground.\nSince 1976, Kerry Packer, the owner of the Nine Network, had sought the rights to broadcast live coverage of Australia's home test matches, and had found himself rebuffed by the Australian Cricket Board in favour of continued live coverage on the Australian Broadcasting Company, which was the country's state broadcaster. Following Nine's winning of the rights to broadcast the 1977 Ashes tour to England, in which Packer was presented with the idea of staging some televised exhibition matches,\nhe fleshed it out into the idea of a full blown series of games between the best Australian players, and the best players from the rest of the world. In 1977, Packer began signing contracts with Australian players recommended by former Australia captain Ian Chappell, while he was also able to negotiate a deal with then England captain Tony Greig for him to act as Packer's agent in signing non-Australian players. Among these non-Australians were a significant number of players from the West Indies, who found the contracts they were being offered would pay them potentially more than they could earn in their entire careers. As a consequence, although only intended to feature Australia against the Rest of the World, the organisers were able to form a third team, made up wholly of West Indian players.\nThe first match was scheduled as a five-day game between the Australian XI and the West Indies XI from 2 December 1977; Packer was unable to use the term \"Test Match\", so the fixture was the first of what came to be known as \"Supertests\". This game, held at VFL Park in Melbourne, began on the same day as the first day of the official Australian team's Test Match against India in Brisbane.\nSupertests.\nOwing to the fact that the MCC holds the copyright to the Laws of Cricket, and Packer was therefore prevented from using them, he recruited former Australia captain Richie Benaud to formulate the rules and conditions for the new competition, which led to each over consisting of 8 balls."

        "text": "The Texas A&amp;M–Commerce Lions women's volleyball team (formerly the East Texas State Lions) is the women's intercollegiate volleyball program representing Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce. The school competes in the Southland Conference (SLC) in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). For the first 44 years of existence, they competed in the Lone Star Conference of Division II. The A&amp;M–Commerce women's volleyball team plays its home games at the University Field House on the university campus in Commerce, Texas. The Lions have won two conference regular-season titles, an LSC tournament championship, and have appeared in the NCAA tournament on six occasions, three times during the tenure of head coach Kathy Goodlett (1983–89) and three under Craig Case. \nThe team is currently coached by Joe Morales.\nHistory.\nWomen's volleyball has been a varsity sport at A&amp;M–Commerce (then East Texas State) since 1978, and the team has played in the LSC since it began sponsoring the sport in 1983. In 1980, the Lions finished the season as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) national runners-up. From its inception until 1982, the program competed in the NAIA under head coach Donna Tavener; that year, it began competing at the NCAA Division II level.\nThe Lions were one of the strongest teams in the LSC during the 1980s, never finishing below fourth place in the conference under the guidance of head coach Kathy Goodlett between 1983 and 1989, and winning the conference regular-season title in 1986 and 1987 as well as the LSC tournament in 1986. The team also reached the NCAA Division II tournament quarterfinals in 1987, and advanced to the second round of the national tournament in the two subsequent seasons, 1987 and 1988.\nSince the end of Goodlett's coaching tenure in 1989, the A&amp;M–Commerce women's volleyball program has failed to win a regular-season conference championship. From 1990 to 2022, the Lions have been coached by Terri Johnson (1990–95), Larry Blackwell (1996–2002), Gwen Weatherford (2003–07), Mark Pryor (2008–09), and Craig Case (2010–2022). Case would lead the Lions to a Lone Star Conference championship in 2018. Case also guided the Lions to three consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances in 2017, 2018, and 2019. On February 3, 2021, Case became the winningest coach in program history, earning his 186th victory.\nDuring their first Division I season, the Lions endured their first losing season since 2014, going 11-23 overall and 6-12 in conference play. Despite this, the Lions still managed to qualify for the Southland Conference Tournament with a seventh place finish. There, they would defeat the New Orleans Privateers in the first round before falling to the McNeese State Cowgirls in the quarterfinal round.\nAfter the season, Case stepped down after 13 seasons as the Lions' head coach on December 5, 2022. Joe Morales was hired as the program's eighth head coach on January 19, 2023.\nIn Morales' first season, the Lions endured another losing season, but still managed to qualify for the Southland Conference Tournament, clinching the final spot. They were eliminated in the first round by the Northwestern State Demons.\nAll-time record.\n\"Year-by-year results through the end of the 2022 season\"\nArena.\nThe Lions women's volleyball program has played at the University Field House since the inception of the program in 1978, although the arena itself was built in 1950 and dedicated in January 1951 as the home of the school's men's basketball program. The Field House has a capacity of 3,055 for both volleyball and basketball contests. The building as a whole measures a total of , enabling it to host the offices of numerous A&amp;M–Commerce sports (including cross country, track and field, soccer, and softball in addition to basketball and volleyball) and university departments (the Athletic Department, Athletic Training, Health and Human Performance, and the James Thrower Academic Center). The arena has also been the host to numerous athletic camps and concerts.\nDesigned by George Dahl, the Field House was intended to resemble an airplane hangar, with an arched roof topping out at that is supported by steel beams. In 1949, school president James Gee announced plans for the building's construction along with Memorial Stadium at a combined cost of $325,000. Since its opening in 1951, the Field House has been renovated on numerous occasions: in 1969 (adding classrooms, offices, and dressing rooms), 1991 (replacing bleachers, hardwood playing surface, the HVAC system, and scoreboards), and 2014 (again replacing the playing surface)."

        "text": "The opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics took place at the Rice-Eccles Olympic Stadium in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, on 8 February 2002.\nU.S. president George W. Bush opened the Winter Olympics — the first U.S. president to do so — which took place five months after the September 11 attacks, with: \"On behalf of a proud, determined and grateful nation...,\" then the standard opening formula followed. The president was standing among the U.S. athletes, while previous heads of state opened the Games from an official box. NBC's Bob Costas applauded the move during the network's coverage of the Opening Ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony was produced and directed by Don Mischer. The production team included Kenny Ortega as the artistic director, Mark Watters as the musical director, and David Goldberg as a producer. The opening ceremony was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Variety Music Or Comedy Special.\nOfficials and Guests.\nThe official box was occupied by the President's Olympic delegation, which featured four future members of their respective sport's Hall of Fame:\nProceedings.\nPrior to the ceremony, the turf inside the stadium was removed and a giant, abstract-shaped ice rink, designed by Seven Nielsen, was installed covering a large part of the stadium floor. Music was directed by Mark Watters. Figure skaters, speed skaters, and hockey players performed on the ice, while cloggers, dancers, and some of the local Native American tribes performed authentic ceremonial dances on the surrounding platform. \nA torn American flag recovered from the wreckage of the September 11 attacks was carried into the stadium by an honor guard of American athletes and escorted in by firefighters and police officers of the NYPD, FDNY, and Port Authority Police, who then stood at attention and saluted the flag. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, clad in white sweaters, performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", the US national anthem, as the flag (the Challenger flag) was raised. The parade of the 2,300 athletes was led by the Child of Light and began traditionally with Greece and ending with the host nation, the United States of America. As the artistic section kicked off, the five native Utah Native American tribes arrived together on horseback and performed several traditional \"Welcome\" stomp dances. Robbie Robertson performed during this segment. \nIt was reported that the IOC had rejected a proposal by the USOC to have its flagbearer carry the Ground Zero flag during the parade of nations, and a USOC spokesperson stated that another idea for the flag and honor guard to enter after the U.S. team in the parade of nations would violate the official protocol. \nThe beauty of the Utah landscape was showcased as huge puppets of native Utah animals, including a 15-foot-long bison and the American bald eagle (the national bird and animal of the U.S.), entered the stadium, as well as dancing pioneer settlers as two trains came together on, symbolizing the US railroad industry which was beneficial to Utah's economy beginning in the 1860s, as well as economically linking the Western U.S. and the Eastern U.S. At the end of this segment, the performers unfurled a giant quilt that covered the entire stadium floor with the 2002 Winter Olympics logo in the center. Two figure skaters, Olympians Kristi Yamaguchi, Jozef Sabovcik (the fire within), and Scott Hamilton performed on the oversized ice rink to the song \"Gold\" by Linda Eder. Other notable skaters included a young local skater and Beatrisa Liang as younger versions of Kristi Yamaguchi's character.\nThe ceremonies were choreographed and rehearsals led by Sarah Kawahara. Sarah won an Emmy for her work in both the opening and closing ceremonies for the Games. Performers were auditioned and put in over 150 hours of practice on the weekends leading up to the Games. Practices were held at both Steiner Ice Arena and on the official venue ice. The main child of light was played by Ryne Sanborn, a young local hockey player who was in the seventh grade at the time of the ceremonies. Sanborn later went on to co-star in the Salt Lake City-based musical trilogy, High School Musical.\nAfter speeches by Jacques Rogge, President of the IOC and Mitt Romney, the CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, the Olympic flame, which had traveled was carried into the stadium by figure skaters Dorothy Hamill and Dick Button. They passed it to other pairs U.S. Olympians, who either ran or skated their short relay. Alpine skier Picabo Street and hockey player Cammi Granato carried it up the steps to the towering torch where they were met by Mike Eruzione, captain of the \"Miracle on Ice\" hockey team that won the Olympic gold medal in 1980. Eruzione summoned the other members of the team, who together lit the Olympic torch. The Opening Ceremony would win seven Emmy Awards.\nFollowing the lighting of the cauldron, \"Light the Fire Within,\" the 2002 Winter Olympic's theme song, was sung by LeAnn Rimes to conclude the ceremony.\nThe President opened the Games standing among the athletes, while previous heads of state opened the Games from an official box. NBC's Bob Costas applauded the move during the network's coverage of the Opening Ceremony.\nAnthems.\nBoth anthems were performed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir"

        "text": "The Equestrian monument to Vittorio Emanuele II is an equestrian statue of the former King Vittorio Emanuele II, located in the Piazza Vittorio Veneto, a small green spot at the east end of the Parco delle Cascine, located along the Arno River, just west of central Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy.\nHistory.\nThe monument was designed by Salvino Salvini, and later modified by Emilio Zocchi, and inaugurated in 1890 in town, and moved to this site in 1932. The first design of the monument dates to 1859, after the last Duke of Lorraine fled Florence, and Tuscany joined the expanding Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia (now including Lombardy and other territories) ruled by Vittorio Emanuele II. The commune sponsored a competition for two equestrian monuments, one dedicated to the King of Sardinia, and the other, to Napoleon III. They were destined for the then called Piazza Maria Antonia (now Piazza dell’Indipendenza).\nIn 1864, Salvino Salvini's design of a larger-than-life size model was chosen for the Vittorio Emanuele monument. Napoleon III's popularity in Italy, however, dimmed after he negotiated the Treaty of Zürich with Austria-Hungary, maintaining their rule in Venetia, and what affection remained, was snuffed in 1861 when France protected Papal rule of Roman territory from Garibaldi's forces. No design for a monument for Napoleon was ever touted.\nThe selection of Florence as capital of Italy in 1865, set the city into urban renewal. Plans by the architect Giuseppe Poggi, moved the statue to its new location, at a prominent intersection of avenues exiting out of the city.\nBut the national government migrated South to Rome within a few years, quashing much of the funds for the refurbishment of Florence. Only in 1878, after the death of Vittorio Emanuele II, was the project was revived. In 1881-1882 a new competition took up a more life-size model by Emilio Zocchi. Emilio and his son, Cesare designed for Pisa a standing monument (1892) to the King.\nThe monument was inaugurated in 1890 in Piazza della Repubblica to a lukewarm reception. The artistry was uninspiring, and King Vittorio Emanuele II, like the Grand Duke Prince Leopold II of Lorraine before him, had only flirted with Florence, a city which had always considered itself as central to Italy as Rome itself. In 1932, with little fanfare, the equestrian statue was exiled to this more pastoral site, which had been proposed by Giuseppe Poggi.\nIn the base are two bronze bas-reliefs: in one, the king leaves the city to claim Rome, and in the other he receives news of the Tuscan plebiscite favoring union with the forming Kingdom of Italy. The front plaque recalls the installation, the rear plaque had the coat of arms of the House of Savoy.\nThe statue depicts the portly King dressed in military regalia with sword. Paradoxically, compared with the same topic, for example, in Milan (1878 by Ercole Rosa), Verona (1883), Bologna (1884 by Giulio Monteverde), Genoa (1886), Venice (1887), and Naples (1897); this steed is more sedate, perhaps wistful of an era that hoped the king would remain dismounted in his capital, but also recalling the similarly tame steeds in the late-Renaissance Florentine monuments honoring the Medici dukes Cosimo I and Ferdinando I. Each of which echoed the calm mastery of rider over horse evident in Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius.\nThen again, the kings of the House of Savoy were more apt to slowly parade into situations, rather than gallop into conflict. Here the rider and steed dominate only a small grass circle, and interact little with the surroundings; more sympathy is earned by the equestrian monument depicting the meeting of Vittorio Emanuele and Garibaldi (Monument to the Meeting of Teano)."

The tournament field was determined on November 29, 2015. Nebraska swept Texas in the final to claim their fourth national championship.\nQualifying teams.\nThe champions of the NCAA's 32 conferences qualified automatically. Twenty-two conferences held tournaments, while the other ten awarded their automatic bid on the basis of being the league's regular-season champion. Those that did not hold tournaments were the American Athletic, Atlantic Coast, Big 12, Big Ten, Big West, Ivy League, Mountain West, Pac-12, Southeastern and West Coast Conferences. The other 32 bids were apportioned on an at-large basis. Only the top 16 teams overall were seeded.\nBracket.\nThe first two rounds were held on campus sites (the home court of the seeded team, with the exception of Creighton. Due to basketball events already being scheduled in Omaha, the Bluejays had to head to Chapel Hill, North Carolina to play the first and second round.). Regional semifinals and finals were held at pre-determined sites. In 2015, those sites were hosted by the University of Texas at Austin, University of Northern Iowa, University of Kentucky, and University of San Diego. Unlike the NCAA basketball tournament, where teams cannot be placed into regionals that they host, the selectors in the volleyball tournament were required to place qualifying teams in their 'home' regionals, in order to reduce travel costs.\nFinal Four.\nFinal Four All-Tournament Team:\nRecord by conference.\nThe columns R32, S16, E8, F4, CM, and NC respectively stand for the Round of 32, Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight, Final Four, Championship Match, and National Champion.\nTelevision.\nAll first and second-round games were broadcast on local networks or digital feeds [Longhorn Network (Austin), SEC+ (College Station, Gainesville), BYUtv (Provo), ESPN3 (Chapel Hill, Lawrence, Louisville, College Station- non-SEC, Austin- non-Texas, Gainesville- non-SEC), TheW.tv (Provo- non BYU), P12 Digital feeds (Los Angeles, Stanford, Seattle), and Big Ten Digital (Minneapolis, University Park, Madison, Lincoln]. The Regional Finals onward will all be on ESPN Networks. ESPN3 will carry all the Regional Semis except one game in San Diego which will be shown on ESPNU. ESPNU will carry all the regional finals. ESPN2 will carry the National Semifinals and Final."

        "title": "Super Bowl LIII halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl LIII Halftime Show, officially known as the Pepsi Super Bowl LIII Halftime Show, took place on February 3, 2019, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, as part of Super Bowl LIII. It was headlined by Maroon 5, joined by rappers Big Boi and Travis Scott as guests.\nPrior to the show, it was reported several musicians turned down offers to perform the show due to their support for Colin Kaepernick, who has accused the NFL and its franchises of colluding against him for his national anthem protests against police brutality. As such, Maroon 5, Big Boi, and Scott, along with national anthem singer Gladys Knight, were criticized by fans and critics for accepting the invitation. In response to the controversy, Scott only agreed to participate if the NFL made a donation to a charity supporting social justice, and Maroon 5 later announced a similar donation to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. Following the death of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" creator Stephen Hillenburg, an online petition to pay tribute to Hillenburg went viral (based on an episode that, itself, centered around a halftime show), leading to a short clip being created for the performance.\nThe show was universally panned by critics and audiences and is widely considered to be one of the worst Super Bowl halftime shows of all time, with critics considering the show to be \"boring\" and \"underwhelming\". They also argued that the choice of Maroon 5 intended to be \"safe\" and uncontroversial in the wake of the Kaepernick controversy. While cited as a highlight of the show, the \"SpongeBob\" clip received negative reviews for its short length; and a portion of the show where Adam Levine was shirtless received audience backlash in comparisons to Janet Jackson's 2004 performance.\nBackground.\nAs early as September 2018, multiple sources had reported that Maroon 5 were to headline the Super Bowl LIII halftime show, but the NFL had not yet made an official announcement. In October 2018, it was reported that Pink and Rihanna had each declined an offer to headline, the former because the negotiation process was too lengthy for her taste and the latter due to her support of Colin Kaepernick. In December, \"Billboard\" reported that Houston-based rapper Travis Scott was expected to make a guest appearance.\nOn January 13, 2019, the NFL officially announced that Maroon 5 would headline the show, joined by Scott and Big Boi, an Atlanta native and member of the hip-hop duo Outkast. In an interview, Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine explained that the band wanted to bring the halftime show \"back to a time when it was a little more simple, when the focus was the connection to the songs.\"\nAfter the death of Stephen Hillenburg, creator of the Nickelodeon cartoon \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", on November 26, 2018, an online petition emerged requesting that David Glen Eisley's song \"Sweet Victory\"—featured in the episode \"Band Geeks\", which followed Squidward Tentacles as he organized an ensemble to perform the halftime show at the \"Bubble Bowl\"—be performed at the show. By December 24, 2018, the petition on Change.org had over one million signatures, and the Twitter account of Mercedes-Benz Stadium also acknowledged the campaign. During the halftime show, a short animation featuring Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob, and Patrick, as well as footage of the Bikini Bottom band from the episode, was used to introduce Scott for his performance of \"Sicko Mode\". According to animator Nico Colaleo, the animation was completed in a few days.\nControversy.\nMaroon 5, Scott, and Big Boi faced criticism for their decision to perform at the halftime show, due to the alleged blacklisting of Colin Kaepernick by the NFL and its franchises for protesting police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem before games. Several artists—including Jay-Z, Cardi B, and Rihanna—reportedly turned down offers to headline the show as a display of solidarity. A petition was organized calling for Maroon 5 to drop out of the show and accusing them of \"choosing to side with the NFL over its players.\"\nIn an interview, Kaepernick's attorney, Mark Geragos, compared Maroon 5's participation to strikebreaking, and argued that if the band wanted to cross the \"intellectual picket line\", they needed to \"own it\", explaining that \"if anything, it's a cop out when you start talking about, 'I'm not a politician, I'm just doing the music.' Most of the musicians who have any kind of consciousness whatsoever understand what's going on here.\"\nA week before the game, the halftime show's press conference was canceled by the NFL. Although the league stated that Maroon 5 had wanted to focus on their preparations for the show, media outlets theorized that the band was trying to avoid the possibility of having to discuss the controversy. In an interview with \"Entertainment Tonight\", Levine discussed the band's decision to accept the gig and explained, \"I silenced all the noise and listened to myself and made my decision based upon how I felt... I'm not in the right profession if I can't handle a little bit of controversy. It's what it is. We expected it. We'd like to move on from it and speak through the music.\"\nIn response to the controversy, Scott agreed to participate in the halftime show only if the NFL joined him in donating $500,000 to Dream Corps, an organization founded by Van Jones that supports social justice efforts. Maroon 5 subsequently announced that they had joined with the NFL and their label Interscope Records to donate the same amount to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.\nReception.\nIn the United States, the Super Bowl LIII halftime show attracted 99.04 million viewers, The viewership for the halftime show was slightly higher than the game itself, which was viewed by an average of 98.4 million television viewers.\nDominic Patten of \"Deadline Hollywood\" called the show \"terrible\" and stated it lacked \"lift-off or soul.\" Writing for Yahoo! Entertainment, Lyndsey Parker called it the \"dullest ... most underwhelming and instantly forgettable halftime show of all time.\" Alex Suskind of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it \"lackluster\" and \"boring\". Greg Kot of \"The Baltimore Sun\" called it an \"empty-calorie display of corporate-pop competence.\" Clémence Michallon of \"The Independent\" gave it two stars out of five and stated it \"failed to impress.\"\nJon Caramanica of \"The New York Times\" felt that \"in a performance that was dynamically flat, mushy at the edges, worthy of something much worse than derision: a shrug. It was an inessential performance from a band that might have lost some moral authority if it had any moral authority to lose.\" Rhian Daly of \"NME\" said it was \"surprise-free, trite, and soulless\" and \"with Maroon 5's set, [Levine]'s given the world an easy target – one that's boring, trite, and saying absolutely nothing of any value whatsoever.\" Jake Nevins of \"The Guardian\" also gave the performance two out of five stars, writing \"Adam Levine's torso can't save tedious affair.\" However, Kevin Coffey of the \"Omaha World-Herald\" said \"it was exactly what it needed to be.\"\nMaeve McDermott of \"USA Today\" observed that the performance felt \"safe\" and \"dialed-in\", with \"zero surprises and nothing that could add to the headache the league has already endured\", and noting that Maroon 5's portions of the show relied heavily on early hits from their debut album rather than newer material (aside from \"Girls Like You\", \"Sugar\" and \"Moves like Jagger\"). Feeling that the guest artists were more exciting (although noting Scott's portion, due to the \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" introduction and crowd surfing exit, was the only \"genuinely weird\" moment of the show), she wrote that the choice of Maroon 5 as headliner was \"misguided\" for a Super Bowl held in Atlanta, the \"nexus of hip-hop\", and that the show was \"distinctive only for how uncontroversial it was, how wholly a missed opportunity it represented, and how much of Levine's truly abysmal dance moves we were all forced to watch.\"\nThe short clip featuring the cast of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" was noted as a highlight of the show by several news outlets. However, fans of the animated show had mixed reaction, with many venting their anger on social media that Maroon 5 did not play the song \"Sweet Victory\" as requested by the online petition. The Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League featured a performance of the song (a slightly altered version of the original \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" scene) between periods of a game two days before the Super Bowl, which was posted online one day after the Super Bowl.\nFifty-five complaints were sent to the FCC over the halftime show, due to a sequence in which Levine removed his shirt. The complaints alleged that it was a double standard for CBS to be fined for briefly showing a female breast on-air during a previous halftime show, but to receive no punishment for showing a bare male chest.\nIn 2021, Patrick Ryan of \"USA Today\" retrospectively wrote that it ranks among the worst halftime shows of the 2010s. However, Maroon 5 saw a sales surge of nearly 500% following the group's Super Bowl LIII performance, according to Nielsen.\n50 complaints were filed with the Federal Communications Commission regarding the show's content, a comparatively small number compared to the 1,300 that would be filed over the next year's show.\nSetlist.\nSetlist adapted from \"Sports Illustrated\", CBS Sports, and Yahoo!

        "title": "Super Bowl LIV halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl LIV halftime show, officially known as the Pepsi Super Bowl LIV Halftime Show, took place on February 2, 2020, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, as part of Super Bowl LIV. It was televised in the U.S. by Fox. It was co-headlined by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, and included guest appearances by Bad Bunny, J Balvin, and Lopez's daughter Emme Muñiz.\nThe halftime show received critical acclaim including four Primetime Emmy nominations, winning one. It was also received many other awards, winning \"Best Live Performance\" at the 2021 Premios Nuestra Tierra credited to Shakira.\nBackground.\nIn August 2019, it was announced Jay-Z's company Roc Nation had entered a deal with the NFL for him and his company to produce the halftime show in the wake of his and others' backlash against the previous year's musical acts Maroon 5 and Travis Scott seen as strikebreakers to the politics around Colin Kaepernick.\nOn September 26, 2019, the selection of Shakira and Jennifer Lopez to headline the show was announced; according to reports, the selection was intended to reflect the Latin culture of the host city Miami. This was the third time Latin music artists headlined the Super Bowl halftime show; Gloria Estefan headlined both the Super Bowl XXVI halftime show in 1992 and the Super Bowl XXXIII halftime show in 1999. For months, rumors Lopez might be chosen as a halftime show act had circulated; she had expressed her interest in doing so in July 2019. Jon Pareles of the \"New York Times\" also wrote in his review of the show that booking the two \"steered the halftime show away from black-and-white racial tensions and toward the joys of motion and seduction.\" Multiple big acts have paired before: Aerosmith and NSYNC in 2001 and Coldplay, Beyoncé, and Bruno Mars in 2016.\nDevelopment.\nRoc Nation served as producers and creative directors of the show; their producers included Dan Parise. Ricky Kirshner served as the show's executive producer and Hamish Hamilton served as director.\nAdam Blackstone, the musical director of the show noted that the show intends to cement what both women represent. Calling Shakira a \"global phenomenon\" he says he had to think about the singer's global fan base. For Jennifer, he says the intentions were to represent her as an icon in acting, music, and dance. His vision and mission were to make the two acts feel cohesive and a part of the same show.\nTabitha and Napoleon D'umo served as the creative directors and choreographers for Lopez's half of the show, which included approximately 130 dancers. which was choreographed by Tabitha D'umo and Parris Goebel. Jaquel Knight, Nadine Eliya, and Maite Marcos were the creative directors and choreographers of Shakira's half. In mid-January, the producers announced they would recruit approximately 600 field team members to assist with the performance. Ultimately, 670 team field members were enlisted.\nAmong the equipment used for the show were 565 ROE CB5 tiles, 8 Brompton SX40 4K LED processors, 22 Brompton Tessera XD data distribution boxes using 8x optical fiber runs, 4 4K video feeds—two main and two for backup—and 8 LED techs. The pyrotechnics for the show used 5,350 pieces of product, which were launched from 32 roof locations and 16 special locations, using 80 firing modules. A FireOne control system was used. Twenty-four 30W Arctos Systems lasers were used in the show.\nFashion.\nReviewer Chris Willman of \"Variety\" wrote \"Costumers deserve almost as much credit as the choreographers here.\" Shakira's set had three costume changes; each piece was custom-made by Norwegian designer Peter Dundas. Her first was a red, cropped bustier with a cross-straps top that was paired with a removable corset and fringed skirt, each of which were covered with 123,000 Swarovski crystals in three shades of red. This was paired with crystal-accented leather cuffs and knee-high boots that were made by the designer Daniel Jacob. The boots were covered with 30,000 Swarovski crystals and took ten days to create. Shakira then made a mid-performance costume change to reveal a fringed, feathered skirt that was previously hidden under a sarong. Her final costume was an entirely new ensemble consisting of a bomber jacket covered in gold sequin embroidery and gold-and-white Swarovski crystals on a matching gold sequin crop top, which she wore with matching high-waisted hot pants and Dundas-customized Adidas Superstar sneakers.\nLopez's stylists were Rob Zangardi and Mariel Haenn, her makeup artist was Scott Barnes, and her hairstylist was Chris Appleton. Her set involved five costume changes; all of her looks and those of her dancers were custom-designed by Versace and approved by Donatella Versace: Lopez was the face of Versace's Spring 2020 campaign. Haenn noted; \"Every look has to be layered one on top of the other because she never really leaves the stage\". Lopez's first outfit was a Swarovski crystal-and-gold-studded, biker-inspired black leather Medusa bodysuit paired with a pink satin ball gown skirt. Her backup dancers also wore black leather biker jackets paired with pleated miniskirts trimmed with black lace. During the set she tore off her skirt to reveal black leather chaps. Lopez later took off this outfit to reveal a custom-made body-hugging silver catsuit coated in crystals and tiny mirrored panels. She next changed into a metal-mesh-and-crystal-fringed bustier with bondage-harness details, topped by a feather cape around her shoulders that depicted the U.S. flag on the outside and the Puerto Rican flag on the inside. Lopez later revealed that the Puerto Rican flag's inclusion in the show was a secret, \"The flag — I didn't even show it to anybody until the last minute because I didn't want anybody telling me I couldn't do it\", adding: \"I just had the American flag on the outside and during rehearsals\".\nSynopsis.\nShakira, standing on a platform on the stage and wearing a \"tiny red sequin dress\", opened the show dancing \"Dare (La La La)\". She started her set with a performance of \"She Wolf\", surrounded by a group of dancers, the segued into a performance of \"Empire\", during which she played an electric guitar and included elements of \"Inevitable\" and Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\". She then wrapped a rope around her wrists, sang part of the first verse of \"Ojos Así\", and then did a belly dancing using part of \"Move\" by Said Mrad with added strings. This was followed by a performance of \"Whenever, Wherever\", after which guest artist Bad Bunny joined her on stage. Shakira and Bad Bunny performed a cover of his song \"I Like It\" then they sang a mash up of Shakira's \"Chantaje\" and Bunny's \"Callaíta\" together. In the final section of Shakira's set, she performed \"Hips Don't Lie\", during which she crowd surfed, danced mapalé, and wagged her tongue in an Arabic tradition known as zaghrouta.\nJennifer Lopez then appeared for the beginning of her set wearing a black leather bodysuit. After rising from a \"skyscraper-turned-stripper pole\", she performed and opens up with a one second sample of Frankie Cutlass Hip Hop classic song \"Puerto Rico\" then \"Jenny from the Block\" then \"Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)\", while backed by dancers. Following a performance of \"Get Right\", Lopez changed her costume for a \"sparkling\" catsuit and sang \"Waiting for Tonight\" while pole dancing; her pole-dance routine included a \"tabletop move with the dancers writhing underneath\". She was then joined on stage by J Balvin, who performed \"Que Calor\" and \"Mi Gente\", which were mashed up with Lopez's songs \"Booty\", \"El Anillo\" and \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" as she danced above. Lopez then performed \"On the Floor\".\nShakira returned to play drums while Lopez's daughter Emme Muñiz appeared on stage to sing \"Let's Get Loud\" with an excerpt from Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\" as Lopez was in front of an all-female choir. During this section of Lopez's set, she wore a feather cape depicting both the Puerto Rican and American flags while children on the field appeared in \"cage like structures\", which was interpreted as a statement on the U.S.-Mexico border crisis.\nShakira, who was now clothed in a \"short golden outfit\", subsequently performed \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" during a dance routine of champeta. Lopez then returned to the stage to perform \"Aguanile\" by Héctor Lavoe as a \"Vegas-style salsa number\" and was joined by Colombian salsa dance group Swing Latino. Both of the headlining acts ended their performance with \"synchronized shimmies\".\nCritical response.\nThe halftime show was critically acclaimed. Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" lauded the performance, calling it an improvement over the previous years halftime. He called the show \"a no-nonsense affirmation of Latin pride and cultural diversity in a political climate where immigrants and American Latinos have been widely demonized\", called Shakira and Lopez \"Latina superwomen, smiling pop conquistadoras backed by phalanxes of dancers\", and calling the show \"euphoria with a purpose\". David Bauder of the Associated Press wrote Lopez and Shakira \"infused the Super Bowl halftime show with an exuberance and joy that celebrated their Latina heritage\". He also wrote, \"Their breathless athleticism matched that of the football players waiting in the locker room\" but called J Balvin's and Bad Bunny's guest appearances \"superfluous\". Greg Kot of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote, \"Prince's 2007 Super Bowl performance is still king of halftime, but Shakira and J Lo were certainly the most undeniable performance since then\". Bobby Olivier of NJ.com described the halftime show as \"high-octane, relentless Latin pop fun\", adding it was \"a blazing performance that should challenge Lady Gaga and Beyoncé as some of the best halftime sets of the past decade or so\".\nChuck Arnold of the \"New York Post\" described the performance as \"electric\". Greg Evans of \"Deadline Hollywood\" wrote, \"In a high-energy mix of music, dance and sequins, Lopez and Shakira (and several teams worth of back-up dancers) delivered a spectacle-style show [that is] not without its statements\". Alex Suskind of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said the performance was \"a punchy, political, and flat-out electric 14-minute performance that doubled as a salute to Latin culture and celebration of both stars' careers\". Patrick Ryan of \"USA Today\" hailed the performance as \"one of the best Super Bowl halftime shows in memory.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called the show the most \"lively, and smile inducing\" halftime show.\nThere were also criticisms. John J. Moser of \"The Morning Call\" called it the \"sexiest halftime show in memory\", but also said it was not the \"edgiest or most contemporary\" halftime show in recent years. Jeff Miers of \"The Buffalo News\" wrote, \"the Super Bowl halftime show has not really been about music, per se, in a long while. The J-Lo/Shakira throwdown carried that tradition forward, emphasizing spectacle, bombast and flash over music—in this case, an only mildly Latin-flavored pop-dance hybrid\". On Shakira's role in the show, Naomi Fry of \"The New Yorker\" wrote, \"she looked and sounded great, moving fleetly between monster bangers\". She also wrote, \"Lopez's voice isn't her strongest asset, and she spent minutes at a time dancing rather than singing, but her showmanship was unparalleled\", calling the pace of her performance \"furious.\" In \"Vibe\", Desire Thompson praised Shakira's \"cultural homages\" which were \"the most prominent\" during the show, referring to her inclusion of mapalé, champeta and zaghrouta.\nThe reaction was more negative particularly among conservative and Christian audiences. Leah Barkoukis of Townhall.com commented; \"If it was a mix of hypersexual entertainment with a bonus political statement you were looking for in Super Bowl LIV's halftime show, then 2020's big game didn't disappoint\". Evangelist Franklin Graham said the performance was \"showing young girls that sexual exploitation of women is okay\". Jeanne F. Mancini, president of anti-abortion rally March for Life, said the show was \"[e]mbarrassing for everyone [she was] with—looking away, etc\". In a \"USA Today\" op-ed, Gil Smart stated the show \"should have come with a parental warning\" and that \"to some, the show was a joyful, Miami-infused explosion of dance and high-energy music that got you out of your seat ... To others, it looked a lot like softcore porn\". Despite this criticism from some conservative outlets, some prominent Republicans from Florida, including political strategist and commentator Ana Navarro, Senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, and former governor Jeb Bush, praised the show. An investigation by Dallas-Fort Worth television station WFAA found viewers filed more than 1,300 complaints to the FCC over the content.\nDee Snider of Twisted Sister accused the National Football League (NFL) of neglecting heavy metal and hard rock music. However, hard rock acts have made appearances in past Super Bowl halftime shows, such as The Who, Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, Tom Petty, and Bruce Springsteen.\nCommercial reception.\nIn the United States, the Super Bowl LIV halftime show attracted 103 million viewers, an increase of 4% on the previous year. The viewership was slightly higher than the game itself, which was viewed by an average of 99.9 million television viewers. Social media activity relating to the show showed a significant spike; over 1 million tweets mentioned Lopez and Shakira, a 431% increase from the previous year's 127,576 mentions of Maroon 5. Of the 1,114,545 tweets mentioning the show, 69% expressed a positive sentiment; 38% of tweets expressed joy and 8% expressed love. Shakira's name generated over 2.6 million tweets which accumulated more tweets than the Super Bowl as a whole (1.85 million) placing her at number one on trending topics. Her zaghrouta during the show resulted in a viral internet meme.\nBoth Lopez's and Shakira's music also experienced increased sales. According to an initial sales report by Nielsen Music, the songs performed in the show experienced a 1,013% sales increase in the U.S. on February 2, increasing to 16,000 digital downloads—up from just over 1,000 the previous day.

        "title": "1992 Rugby League World Cup final",
        "text": "The 1992 Rugby League World Cup final was the conclusive game of the 1989–1992 Rugby League World Cup tournament and was played between Great Britain and Australia on 24 October 1992 at Wembley Stadium in London, England. Australia won the final by 10 points to 6 in front of an international record crowd of 73,631. Australia, the defending champions, won the Rugby League World Cup for the 7th time.\nThe crowd of 73,631 at Wembley set a new international rugby league attendance record, eclipsing the previous record of 70,204 established during the first test of the 1932 Ashes series at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nBackground.\nGreat Britain.\nThe Mal Reilly coached Great Britain started their World Cup campaign on 11 November 1989 when they defeated New Zealand 10–6 at Central Park in Wigan. Until the Final, The Lions won another 4 games while losing 3.\nNine of the 17 selected players for the Lions were from the 1992 RFL champions Wigan.\nAustralia.\nAustralia began their World Cup campaign with a 22–14 win over New Zealand in the third test of the 1989 Trans-Tasman series in Auckland on 23 July 1989. The Bob Fulton coached Kangaroos would win all 8 of their qualifying games.\nSeven of the players selected for Australia were members of the Brisbane Broncos 1992 NSWRL premiership winning team.\nAustralia were the defending World Cup Champions and had won all three World Cup finals since 1975. The Kangaroos had won the 1988 Rugby League World Cup final 25–12 over New Zealand at Eden Park in Auckland.\nIn the fortnight prior to the World Cup final (following the 1992 NSWRL Grand Final), the Australians embarked on a mini three game tour of England, essentially using the games as selection trial for the Final at Wembley. The Australians wore a non-traditional mostly white jumper with a green and gold diamond pattern in the shape of Kit supplier Umbro.\nThe Australian squad for their WCF Tour was:\nMal Meninga (c), Allan Langer (vc), Tim Brasher, Willie Carne, John Cartwright, Bradley Clyde, Brad Fittler, David Gillespie, Brad Godden, Michael Hancock, Paul Harragon, Chris Johns, Glenn Lazarus, Bob Lindner, Graham Mackay, Steve Renouf, Mark Sargent, Paul Sironen, Kerrod Walters, Kevin Walters, Steve Walters.\nOf the selected squad, only team vice captain Allan Langer, Paul Sironen and David Gillespie had played in Australia's 1988 World Cup final win over New Zealand. All three would go on to play in the Final at Wembley playing in the same positions and wearing the same numbers (7, 11 and 14 respectively) they had done four years earlier at Eden Park.\nHead to Head.\nBefore the final, Australia and Great Britain had played each other 119 times, with Australia winning 57 times, Great Britain 57 and 5 draws. Australia had not lost a test series or a World Cup to Great Britain (or England) since the 1972 World Cup.\nAustralia and Great Britain had met in three previous World Cup finals; 1970 at Headingley Stadium in Leeds (won 12–7 by Australia), 1972 at Stade de Gerland in Lyon, France (the game finished in a 10–10 draw but the Lions were awarded the Cup after finishing on top of the table), and 1977 at the Sydney Cricket Ground (won 13–12 by Australia).\nHost venue.\nAs they had done in 1988, Australia won the right to host the World Cup final. However, in the interests of rugby league and although they were confident of a sell-out if the game was held in Australia after capacity crowds attended all three Ashes Series tests earlier in the year against Great Britain, with the potential for a much larger attendance since at the time Lang Park in Brisbane could only hold 32,500, and the Sydney Football Stadium could only seat 42,500, the Australian Rugby League (ARL) agreed to the Rugby Football League (RFL) hosting the final at the 82,000 capacity Wembley Stadium in London.\nMatch details.\nFirst half.\nThe first half of the World Cup final was a tight affair. The Lions took the lead early thanks to a penalty goal from Deryck Fox after a spilled bomb in front of the posts by debuting Kangaroos fullback Tim Brasher. Fox put up an attacking bomb and Brasher was tackled by Lions fullback Joe Lydon as he attempted to catch the ball. From there Steve Renouf dived on the loose ball that was only 2 metres in front of the posts and was ruled to be offside. From then on Fox and Kangaroos captain Mal Meninga traded penalty goals until the half with Great Britain going into the break with a 6–4 lead.\nGreat Britain were lucky to have a full complement on the field from about the 20 minute mark of the final after hooker Martin Dermott had caught Australian five-eighth Brad Fittler with an elbow to the face. However Dermott was cautioned by referee Hale rather than sent off. While Meninga kicked a penalty goal, Fittler went to the sidelines where he was cleared of serious injury and returned to the game without being replaced. At half time, Kangaroos doctor Nathan Gibbs diagnosed a hairline fracture of his cheek bone, but cleared him to play on.\nGreat Britain wasn't without its own problems though. Early in the first half fullback Joe Lydon picked up an ankle injury and he would be eventually replaced by Alan Tait in the second half. The Lions would also lose centre Gary Connolly to a leg injury which would see him replaced by a former Welsh rugby union international, John Devereux.\nSecond half.\nInto the second half the match was becoming a struggle with neither team seriously threatening the others line. The closest either team came to scoring was when Australian winger Willie Carne looked to have scored in the corner but the final pass from Meninga was ruled forward. The home side were still leading 6–4 with only 12 minutes remaining. The only try of the match was then set up by Australian replacement back Kevin Walters who, with a clever cut-out pass, put his Brisbane Broncos teammate Steve Renouf into a gap not covered by replacement Lions centre John Devereux (Walters had replaced lock forward Bradley Clyde who left the field with a dislocated shoulder). Renouf, in his debut test for Australia, then raced 20 metres to score in the corner. Meninga's sideline conversion of Renouf's try gave Australia what would be a match winning 10–6 lead. The rain started pouring midway through the second half and Australia was able to hold Great Britain out and maintain their lead until the final siren.\nAustralian hooker Steve Walters was named the man-of-the-match for the 1992 World Cup final.\nBroadcast.\nThe match was broadcast into the United Kingdom by the BBC with commentary from Ray French and Alex Murphy.\nThe match was telecast live late at night throughout Australia on the Nine Network, with commentary provided by Ray Warren and former Australian test players Peter Sterling and Paul Vautin, with sideline comments from Chris Bombolas. The game broke Australia's midnight-to-dawn television ratings record which was set a year earlier by the rugby union's 1991 Rugby World Cup final in which Australia had defeated England at Twickenham Stadium in London."

        "text": " is a professional baseball catcher for the Hanshin Tigers in Japan's Central League.\nEarly life.\nShimizu was born in Miki, Hyogo, Japan on 23 April 1984. He started playing baseball when he was in the second grade at Hirata Elementary School in Miki, becoming the team's catcher due to his strong arm. After leading Miki Junior High School to third place in a regional tournament as the team's catcher and number four batter, he wanted to enroll in a high school known for its baseball program. However on his parents' advice that \"only a handful can feed themselves playing baseball\", he instead enrolled in the academically known Ono High School in Miki. He became the high school's main catcher in the summer of his first year, helping his team reach the quarter finals of the Hyogo Prefectural High School Tournament in his final year.\nHeeding his parents advice further, Shimizu enrolled at Kwansei Gakuin University rather than trying to turn professional after high school. Due to an injury to the university club's main catcher, he was able to take the role immediately upon joining the club, remaining in the position for his four years of university. In his final year he was named in the Kansai University League's best nine in both the spring and autumn seasons. He had a total of 6 home runs while at university.\nShimizu was drafted by the Hanshin Tigers in the fourth round of the 2006 university/adult draft.\nProfessional career.\nIn 2007 Shimizu was evaluated highly during practice matches and pre-season matches, earning a place on the first-team roster for the start of the season. However, he did not get an opportunity to play for the first team and was eventually sent to the Tigers' farm team in the Western League. He played 41 games for the farm team, with a batting average of .260 and 5 home runs. In 2008, he played in 54 Western League matches, including 47 as a catcher. His batting average fell and he hit only 3 home runs. During the year he was wearing contact lenses, but underwent laser corrective surgery at the end of the year.\nIn 2009, he again started the season in the first-team squad due to leading catcher Akihiro Yano being injured. He made his first appearance for the Tigers' first team in the second match of the season, on 4 April 2009 against the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. On 17 May he made his first start and recorded his first hit, also against the Swallows. He appeared in a total of 20 first-team games, as well as 23 games for the farm team in which he had a batting average of .278.\nPersonal life.\nAt the end of the 2009 season Shimizu announced his intention to marry a classmate from his junior high school in December 2009."

        "text": "The 2015 FIA GT World Cup was the race's inaugural edition and the eighth time Grand Touring (GT) sports car machinery participated in Macau's autonomous territory. On November 22, it was staged in the streets of the city as a non-championship race as part of the GT Asia Series in GT3-spec cars. The Automobile General Association Macau-China appointed the Stéphane Ratel Organisation (SRO) to assist in establishing a grid. The race itself consisted of two races: a 12-lap qualification race that determined the starting grid for the 14-lap main race.\nMercedes AMG Driving Academy driver Maro Engel won the main race from pole position after winning the Qualification Race the previous day after on-track victor Edoardo Mortara was penalised ten seconds for brake testing him. Mortara accelerated faster than Engel during the rolling start, but he quickly lost the lead to the former. Engel then dominated the rest of the race, which was stopped two laps early due to a multi-car accident behind the safety car, and the result was recalculated two laps back. René Rast finished second in his Audi R8 LMS, while Stefan Mücke completed the podium in his Craft-Bamboo Racing entered Aston Martin Vantage V12.\nEntry list and rules.\nTo enter the FIA GT World Cup in Macau, drivers had to compete in a Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)-regulated championship based on GT3 regulations. On 11 September 2015, Audi, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz, McLaren and Porsche were announced as the five manufacturers accepted to enter the event that was open to any car model meeting GT3 rules. Manufacturers could enter up to three drivers through privateer teams, and the teams representing manufacturers could field both gold and platinum ranked drivers; bronze and silver-rated entrants were considered on a case-by-case basis by the FIA GT World Cup Committee. On October 7, 2015, the FIA GT World Cup entry list was released. The first list of participants had 22 drivers, including 2014 Macau GT Cup race winner Maro Engel, two-time Macau Grand Prix victor Edoardo Mortara, and 24 Hours of Le Mans co-winner Earl Bamber. René Rast, a World Endurance Championship participant, was called in as a late replacement for Laurens Vanthoor, who withdrew from the race on doctor's orders after injuring his hip at the Misano World Circuit's Blancpain Sprint Series round.\nBackground.\nThe 2015 FIA GT World Cup was the event's maiden running and the eighth time Grand Touring (GT) cars contested in Macau. It took place on November 22, 2015, at the 6.2 km (3.9 mi) 22-turn Guia Circuit, after three days of practise and qualifying. The motorsport promoter Stéphane Ratel Organisation (SRO) elected not to renew its contract with the FIA two years before the 2015 FIA GT World Cup, and in early 2013, the SRO's founder, Stéphane Ratel, proposed creating a race for the finest teams and drivers. These proposals were dormant for a while until an FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Doha saw the idea resurface and eventually confirmed by the sport's governing body on 20 March 2015. It was the first collaboration between Ratel and the FIA since the FIA GT1 World Championship disbanded. The FIA GT World Cup was granted its status after the World Touring Car Championship stopped travelling to Macau, and it replaced the Baku World Challenge which was discontinued that year when Formula One announced it would hold a race in the city from 2016. The Automobile General Association Macao-China, the race's promoter, asked the SRO to assist in forming a grid.\nPractice and qualifying.\nThere was one 30-minute practice session each on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning before Sunday's race. Renger van der Zande set the quickest lap for the Mercedes AMG Driving Academy SLS GT3 in the first practise session at 2 minutes, 20.796 seconds, two-tenths of a second faster than anybody else. In second place was his brandmate Engel. Mortara finished third in the lone Audi Sport Team Phoenix R8 LMS entry. Darryl O'Young's Aston Martin V12 Vantage finished fourth. Bamber was the fastest Porsche competitor, finishing fifth. Positions six through ten were filled by Stefan Mücke, André Couto, Keita Sawa, Rast, and Richard Lyons. Engel led for the majority of the second practice session until Mücke passed him with a time of 2 minutes, 20.082 seconds, the fastest lap of the weekend at the time. Van Der Zande finished second, 0.021 seconds slower, with Adderly Fong third Engel was fourth, and Bamber fifth, repeating his first practise session performance.  Positions six through ten were filled by O'Young, Mortara, Álvaro Parente, his teammate Kévin Estre, and Rast.\nFriday afternoon's half-hour qualifying session determined the starting order for the qualification race through each driver's fastest lap times. Before he hit an inside kerbstone at Mandarin Corner and lost control of his car, which then drifted into a barrier (the first of three stoppages), Engel was the early leader in qualifying. Engel took responsibility for the collision and apologised to his team. Van Der Zande's crash into a wall at Paiol caused qualifying to be turn red-flagged qualifying for the second time to repair the barriers. With less than 12 minutes remaining. Audi devised a strategy to let Mortara to drive in clear air for a pole position effort. But Cuoto experienced oversteer and severely damaged his car in an incident at Mandarin curve, which ricocheted between the barriers. Cuoto's crash, which left him unhurt, led to the session's third and last interruption. With six minutes left in qualifying, Mortara started recording fast sector times to take provisional pole before Mücke passed him with a lap of 2 minutes, 18.032 seconds. Mücke was joined on the grid's front row by Mortara. Engel's accident left him in third. Rast was fourth, Van Der Zande fifth and O'Young sixth. O'Young's teammate Lyons was seventh. Bamber, Fong and Parente were eighth to tenth, respectively. Estre was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten, ahead of teammate Cuoto, Sawa, Marchy Lee, the Thai duo of Pasin Lathouras and Vutthikorn Inthraphuvasak, Dylan Derdaele, Jeffrey Lee, Weng Sun Mok and Philip Ma. John Shen and Jacky Yeung completed the 22 qualifiers.\nQualifying race.\nAt 12:15 Macau Standard Time (), the qualifying race to set the main race's starting order began under dry and cloudy conditions with the air and track temperatures at and . At the start, Mücke stopped Mortara's overtake to retain the lead into Mandarin turn, before Engel used his straightline speed to pass Mortara for second position approaching Lisboa corner. Rast dropped to fifth as brandmate Marchy Lee gained another position before turning into Lisboa corner. Despite matching his pace earlier in the race, Engel was unable to challenge Mücke because the leader controlled his speed; both men pulled away from the trailing Mortara and Van Der Zande. Fong lost control of his Bentley Continental GT and crashed heavily at the Solitude Esses on the third lap. The safety car was deployed a lap later to neutralise the order because his car was stranded in the centre of the track.\nAt the lap eight restart, Mücke got away cleanly to lead the race back up to speed, with Engel and Mortara close behind. Simultaneously, fourth-placed Van Der Zande sought but failed to move up the order. Engel had to take evasive action when Mücke accelerated and then abruptly braked. After the race, Engel expressed his surprise at Mücke's actions. The leaders were unable to execute any further manoeuvres, and the margins at the front grew progressively until the qualification race ended. Mücke led the race from start to finish. He was then found to have brake tested Engel in violation of the regulations and was given a ten-second time penalty. Engel was given the victory and took pole position for the main race. Mortara joined him on the grid's front row. Mücke's penalty demoted him to third place. Van Der Zande was fourth, Rast was fifth, and Lyons was sixth. Following closely were Bamber, O'Young, Parente, and Estre, who rounded out the top ten. Sawa, Marchy Lee, Lathouras, Inthraphuvasak, Derdaele, Jeffrey Lee, Sun Mok, Sheng, Yeng, Cuoto, and Ma were the final 21 classified finishers.\nMain race.\nThe race began under dry and sunny weather at 12:55 local time. The air temperature was and a track temperature at . Fong withdrew from the race because his chassis was too damaged from the previous day's qualification race crash. Mortara made a quick getaway after the race's rolling start and stopped Engel's initial pass to take the lead before the Mandarin Oriental corner. Mortara lost the lead to Engel when he steered into the inside as they approached the Reservoir Kink bend. After a brisk start, his teammate van der Zande took second position. Mücke then took third from Mortara before Lisboa corner. Estre collided with Lyon's rear at the turn, and both drivers retired. After crashing into a barrier at San Francisco Bend, Bamber retired on the lap. At the end of the first lap, Engel led teammate Van der Zande, followed by, Mortara, Mücke, Parente, O'Young, Sawa, Marchy Lee and Lathouras. The first five were covered by five seconds with the rest of the field 18 seconds behind them.\nAt the midway, Derdaele's car had a punctured tyre and retired at Lisboa curve, while Parente lost sixth place to O'Young by having a better exit out of a turn. Meanwhile, Engel extended his advantage over second-placed Van Der Zande when the course of the race altered on lap 12. Van Der Zande was slowed by traffic, allowing Mücke to challenge him for second place heading into Lisboa bend. As a result of the manoeuvre, Mücke struck Van der Zande's vehicle from behind, causing debris to land in Mücke's left rear wheel. The two collided as Mücke passed Van Der Zande on the inside as they approached Lisboa corner on the next lap. Both drivers ran wide under braking, allowing Rast and Mortara of Audi into second and third places. When the safety car was deployed to close the field down following an accident on lap 14, Engel's eight-second lead over Mortara was reduced to nothing. Inthraphuvasak crashed at Paiol corner, leaving his vehicle stranded in the middle of the course.\nAs everyone waited for additional laps at racing speed behind the safety car, a multi-vehicle accident occurred at Moorish Hill with 2½ laps to go. The lapped Shen struck the tyre barrier, and every driver behind him collided with each other since he blocked the course. Race control decided to stop the race and not restart it, counting back the result by two laps. Engel won the first FIA GT World Cup, his second consecutive victory in Macau after winning the GT event in 2014. Mortara finished second before a 20-second time penalty was enforced by the International Sporting Code for being deemed to have jumped the start, promoting Rast and Mucke to second and third. Off the podium, Van Der Zande, O'Young, Mortara, Parente, Marchy Lee, Sawa and Lathouras, Couto, Jeffrey Lee, Sun, Shen, Ma, Yueng and Inthraphuvasak were the final finishers.\nFIA GT World Cup for Manufacturers.\nThe FIA GT World Cup for Manufacturers award was presented to the manufacturer supplying the cars with a manufacturer entry with the highest number of points after adding the points of its two best cars awarded based on the result of the Main Race.\nScoring system.\nTo be classified and earn points, entries had to complete 90 per cent of the winning car's race distance. The pole position winner received no points."

The single-stage race, which was part of the 2015 UCI Women's Road World Cup, was held on 17 May 2015, in Shanghai, China.\nOn wide, mostly flat highways, there were no significant breakaways in the first half of the race, until the duo of Liang Hongyu () and Anastasia Chulkova () established a one-minute lead over the peloton. Their advantage was slowly broken down, predominately due to the work of the riders, and they were reabsorbed into the peloton with to go. In a bunch sprint, the Italian rider, Giorgia Bronzini () won, beating 2014 winners Kirsten Wild () and Fanny Riberot (France national team).\nEntry.\nTen of the UCI women's teams entered the race, each featuring five or six riders. They were joined by eight national teams containing either four or five riders, bringing the total entry up to 93 riders.\nNations\nCourse.\nThe route changed from previous years. The race started at the Shanghai Oriental Sports Center and took place almost entirely on wide, straight highways, with corners predominantly being expansive ninety-degree bends. The course initially followed the Middle Ring Road, the Huaxia Elevated Road and the G1501 Shanghai Ring Expressway, before entering the tunnel under the Yangtze river to reach Changxing Island, shortly followed by a bridge to Chongming Island, from where the route followed the course of previous years, along slightly smaller roads to the finish.\nPreview.\nAfter four rounds of the 2015 UCI Women's Road World Cup, there had been four different winners; Jolien D'Hoore at the Ronde van Drenthe, Lizzie Armitstead at the Trofeo Alfredo Binda-Comune di Cittiglio, Elisa Longo Borghini at the Tour of Flanders, and Anna van der Breggen at the La Flèche Wallonne Féminine. Van der Breggen led the World Cup standings as the racing moved to China for the Tour of Chongming Island, with 290 points, but her were not invited to take part in the event. Kirsten Wild won both the stage race and the World Cup event in 2014, and repeated her success in the 2015 stage race. She was the pre-race favourite to win the 2015 World Cup race on a course that favoured sprinters.\nRace.\nThere were early attacks by two of the Asian teams, and the Korean national team, but on each occasion they were caught back up by the peloton reasonably quickly. The first intermediate sprint was won by Simona Frapporti (), while a subsequent Queen of the Mountain climb was won by Lauren Kitchen (). Crossing the Shanghai Yangtze River Bridge, some riders fell off the back of the peloton in the strong crosswinds. Shortly after, two riders, Liang Hongyu () and Anastasia Chulkova (), broke away and established a lead of roughly one minute, during which Chulkova claimed the second intermediate sprint. riders were at the front of the peloton to close the gap, though another group threatened to split around from the finish. The peloton caught up with the leading duo with of the race remaining.\nClosing towards the finish in a bunch sprint, had intended Chloe Hosking to be the sprinter to try and win, but she got caught up behind a crash in the final kilometre, and so Giorgia Bronzini acted as a lead-out for Annette Edmondson. She had initially intended to move out from behind Kirsten Wild () for a sprint with around to go, but there was no room, so she stayed in Wild's draft. She then found that Edmondson had not been able to follow her, and opted to defend her position and launch a late sprint to pass Wild. Bronzini won, followed by Wild and Fanny Riberot, riding for the France national team. The first 74 riders were all designated the same time."

Adkins (October 5, 1898 – February 10, 1975) was an American football player who played one season for the Decatur Staleys of the American Professional Football Association (APFA). Adkins played college football at Millikin University and Bethany College.\nIn 1917, Adkins enrolled at Millikin and started at right guard for the Millikin Big Blue. The following year, he served in the United States Army for a three-month stint (October 21–December 31) before returning to Millikin. In November 1919, he and teammate Sid Gepford joined the Staleys for their game against the Taylorville Independents; although they won, Millikin head coach Norman Wann was present and banned the two from playing for the Big Blue as they violated their amateur eligibility. The two remained with the Staleys in 1920; Adkins was already working part time for the team's A. E. Staley parent company to pay for college.\nAdkins and Gepford later attended Bethany on the advice of a former Millikin line coach. Since Bethany did not care for amateur statuses, the two were also joined by former Staley teammates. Adkins graduated in 1924 and later became a high school coach and businessman.\nHis father Charles was a member of the United States House of Representatives."

        "text": "Michael Johnston Condon (born April 27, 1990) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender who currently serves as a volunteer assistant goalie coach at Northeastern. Originally undrafted by teams in the National Hockey League (NHL), Condon has previously played for the Montreal Canadiens, Pittsburgh Penguins and Ottawa Senators.\nEarly life.\nCondon was born on April 27, 1990, to Mary and Teddy Condon in Holliston, Massachusetts. He has one older brother, Zach. His father is a sergeant for the Massachusetts State Police, and his mother is a real estate broker. His father was involved in the manhunt of the Boston Marathon bombers. Condon attended the Belmont Hill School before attending Princeton University, where he majored in politics.\nPlaying career.\nUndrafted at the conclusion of his career with Princeton, Condon signed an amateur tryout agreement with the Ontario Reign of the ECHL On April 7, 2013, after four games with the Reign where he went 3–1–0 with a 1.48 goals against average, Condon signed a professional tryout agreement with the Houston Aeros of the American Hockey League (AHL).\nOn May 8, 2013, Condon signed his first professional contract with the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nOn October 11, 2015, Condon started his first NHL game, leading the Canadiens to a 3–1 win against the Ottawa Senators. He stopped 20 of 21 shots, only allowing one goal against from Senators forward Jean-Gabriel Pageau. Senators goaltender Matt O'Connor made his NHL debut in the same game, making the two the first goaltenders to make their first NHL start on the same night since October 14, 1967. On November 9, Condon was named the NHL third star of the week for his play filling in for the injured Carey Price.\nOn October 11, 2016, Condon was claimed off waivers from the Montreal Canadiens by the Pittsburgh Penguins after being waived the previous day. He would only play one period (20 minutes) in relief for the Penguins before being traded to the Ottawa Senators on November 2 for a fifth-round draft pick in 2017. Condon was acquired due to Senators' starter Craig Anderson facing an uncertain future after his wife was diagnosed with cancer, and backup Andrew Hammond being sidelined with an injury.\nIn June 2017, Condon signed a three-year $7.2M contract extension with the Ottawa Senators after being credited with saving the Senators' 2016–17 season by filling in for starter Anderson during which time Condon set team records both for the most consecutive starts by a goalie (27 games) and for the fewest games needed to achieve five shutouts (32 games). In the following 2017–18 season, Condon's play dropped to a save percentage of .902, and he only won five games all season in the backup role to Anderson. However, the abysmal season the Senators had as a whole, in which the team finished second-last in the entire league, heavily contributed to this decline in Condon's performance. Condon suffered a concussion towards the end of the season, ending it early for him.\nOn October 31, 2018, after two dreadful starts to begin Condon's 2018–19 season, the Senators decided to waive Condon and send him down to their AHL affiliate, the Belleville Senators. Condon was injured with Belleville and spent most of the season on the injured list, only appearing in one game. On July 30, 2019, Condon was traded from the Senators, along with a 6th-round pick in 2020 to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for Ryan Callahan and a 5th-round pick in 2020.\nContinuing his rehabilitation from injury, Condon was sidelined to start the 2019–20 season. Assigned to AHL affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch, he appeared in his first game in over a year on December 14, 2019. After six games with the Crunch, Condon was re-assigned to the ECHL for the first time in six years, loaned to the Orlando Solar Bears on February 5, 2020. Condon made four appearances with the Solar Bears before he returned to the AHL, assigned on loan by the Lightning to the Charlotte Checkers, the affiliate to the Carolina Hurricanes on February 26, 2020. Condon made a lone appearance with the Checkers, allowing 4 goals in a 5–3 defeat to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms on February 23, before he was recalled from his loan by the Lightning and returned to the Crunch.\nInternational play.\nCondon was selected as a member of the United States men's national ice hockey team at the 2016 IIHF World Championship. On May 7, 2016, he started the second game of the tournament leading the United States to a 6–3 win against Belarus, making 20 saves."

        "text": "Roger Lamonte Lewis Jr. (born November 27, 1993) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Bowling Green Falcons, earning third-team All-American honors in 2015. In 2016, Lewis was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Giants.\nEarly years.\nLewis attended Pickerington High School Central in Pickerington, Ohio. He became a star football player at the school and he earned scholarship offers from 17 Division I schools. During his senior year in 2012, Lewis was charged with two counts of rape. It was alleged that he raped a classmate in the basement of another classmate's house on December 2, 2011. The second charge alleged that Lewis raped the same classmate again in the back seat of her car on January 6, 2012. A jury acquitted Lewis of the first charge and deadlocked on the second charge, resulting in the judge declaring a mistrial. Lewis avoided a retrial by pleading guilty to making false statements to Pickerington police. The guilty plea to falsification resulted in the rape charge being dismissed. Lewis was sentenced to three years on probation. Afterwards, he opted to attend Jireh Preparatory Academy, a post-high-school college-prep school in Matthews, North Carolina.\nCollege career.\nAfter spending one season at Jireh Preparatory Academy, Lewis committed to play college football at Bowling Green State University on January 6, 2014. In two seasons at Bowling Green, Lewis caught 23 touchdown passes and collected 2,637 receiving yards. He was named first team All-Mid-American Conference in 2014 and 2015. In 2015, he was a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award and was the winner of the Paul Warfield Award. On January 11, 2016, Lewis announced his decision to enter the 2016 NFL Draft.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Giants.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2016 NFL Draft, Lewis was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent. The signing of Lewis was officially announced on May 6, 2016.\nLewis was able to work his way up the depth chart after beginning his rookie season as the 7th receiver, and was able to split time with Victor Cruz throughout the season. On October 16, 2016, he made his first career catch for a 24-yard touchdown reception against the Baltimore Ravens. On November 6, 2016, he caught a 30-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to help his team to a 28–23 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. He earned his first career start in place of an injured Victor Cruz against the Cincinnati Bengals on November 14, 2016, and finished the game with two catches for 2 yards.\nLewis started the 2017 season as the Giants' No. 4 receiver behind Odell Beckham Jr., Brandon Marshall and Sterling Shepard. In Week 6, Lewis was forced into the starting role after Beckham and Marshall suffered season-ending injuries the previous week and Shepard was sidelined with an injury from the same game.\nOn September 1, 2018, Lewis was waived by the Giants.\nTennessee Titans.\nOn October 10, 2018, Lewis was signed to the practice squad of the Tennessee Titans. He signed a reserve/future contract with the Titans on December 31, 2018. On May 7, 2019, Lewis was released.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nOn July 30, 2019, Lewis was signed by the Indianapolis Colts. He was released on August 31, 2019."

MacLeod played at the Fly-half position.\nMacLeod played at amateur level for Glasgow High Kelvinside; and was called up for the amateur Glasgow District side only once before the province turned professional. In the 1995-96 season he was picked to play for Glasgow District against North &amp; Midlands. Glasgow lost this game 13-21 and thus they did not qualify for the 1996-97 season's Scottish Heineken Cup places.\nThe GHK fly-half was to play in three of Glasgow's five games in the European Conference of 1996-97 season, now the European Challenge Cup. He replaced Calum MacGregor who was dropped.\nFirst up for him was a match against Sale Sharks at Glasgow's Hughenden Stadium. Glasgow was convincingly beaten by 29 points to 9. A few days later the second match was played; a real away drubbing against AS Montferrand - now Clermont - ensued, with Montferrand running out 76-9 winners. Finally an away match against Newport RFC ended up with Newport winning 25-10.\nAfter these defeats MacLeod himself was dropped in favour of Andrew Garry at fly-half for the final match against Agen, at Hughenden. However Glasgow lost this home match too. Glasgow ended up fourth in their pool and did not qualify for the next round.\nMacLeod was to fare better in the Glasgow High Kelvinside - Glasgow Academicals derby match in October 1996 when GHK outplayed Accies in a resounding win; MacLeod scoring a penalty and conversion in the game.\nWhen GHK and Accies merged in 1997, MacLeod played for the newly merged team Glasgow Hawks. Both GHK and Accies survived the merger as lower league teams and in 2002 MacLeod was back playing for Glasgow High Kelvinside."

Haley is Irish-qualified through his maternal grandmother, who hails from Tralee, County Kerry. He made his competitive debut for Munster on 1 September 2018, starting at fullback in their opening 2018–19 Pro14 fixture against South African side Cheetahs in Thomond Park, a game which Munster won 38–0.\nHaley made his European debut for Munster on 13 October 2018, starting in the provinces 10–10 draw with Exeter Chiefs in Sandy Park in the sides' opening 2018–19 Champions Cup fixture. He scored his first try for Munster on 20 October 2018, doing so in the provinces 36–22 win against Gloucester. Haley signed a two-year contract extension with Munster in March 2021, and extended that contract by a further two years in September 2022.\nHaley started and scored one try in Munster's historic 28–14 win against a South Africa XV in Páirc Uí Chaoimh on 10 November 2022, and started in Munster's 19–14 win against the Stormers in the final of the 2022–23 United Rugby Championship on 27 May 2023.\nInternational career.\nHaley received his first call-up to the senior England squad by coach Eddie Jones for a three-day training camp in May 2016. He made his debut for the England Saxons on their tour against South Africa A in June 2016. However, this appearance did not tie him fully to the RFU because, at the time, South Africa A was not SARU's second team. Haley was subsequently named in a provisional elite player squad for the 2016–17 season.\nHaley represented an England XV in the Old Mutual Wealth Cup against the Barbarians in a non-cap international at Twickenham Stadium in May 2017. Again, this match did not tie him to the RFU as the Barbarians are a club team, and he thus remained eligible for future Ireland selection.\nIn May 2019, Haley was named by Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt in a 44-man training squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Along with Munster teammate Jean Kleyn, this was Haley's first time being named in an Ireland squad. He made his debut for Ireland in their 2019 Rugby World Cup warm-up match against Italy on 10 August 2019, featuring as a replacement in the 29–10 win. However, Haley was dropped from the squad before the 2019 Rugby World Cup."

Including the competition's previous incarnation as the FIBA Europe Champions Cup, this was the 60th season of the premier level competition for European men's professional basketball clubs.\nThis was the first season in which the competition changed to a league format, with sixteen teams playing each other in a home-and-away round-robin competition. Regular season groups were abolished, as well as the Top 16 group stage. \nThe Final Four was hosted by the Sinan Erdem Dome in Istanbul, Turkey. Fenerbahçe won its inaugural European championship in its home city after defeating Olympiacos in the final.\nFormat changes.\nIn July 2015, FIBA tried to take the helm of the EuroLeague, by trying to convince eight of the eleven teams with an A-Licence to play in a new competition organized by FIBA instead of the current EuroLeague. This proposal was unanimously rejected by the EuroLeague clubs. In October 2015, FIBA attempted to take back control of Europe's first tier club competition, by proposing that the Basketball Champions League become Europe's new 1st tier competition, with 16 teams playing in a round-robin format, granting eight guaranteed spots to different clubs.\nIn November 2015, Euroleague Basketball agreed to a 10-year joint venture with IMG. In its press release, the EuroLeague announced a new competition format for the 2016–17 season, with only 16 teams, including the eleven licensed clubs (Anadolu Efes, Baskonia, CSKA Moscow, FC Barcelona, Fenerbahçe, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Olimpia Milan, Olympiacos, Panathinaikos, Real Madrid, and Žalgiris).\nThe regular season features a single group with a double round-robin. The first eight qualified teams will then play in a best-of-five playoff round for qualification to the Final Four. As a result, the maximum number of games per team increased from 31 to 37.\nTeam allocation.\nA total of 16 teams participated in the 2016–17 EuroLeague.

        "title": "Le Moyne Dolphins men's basketball",
        "text": "The Le Moyne Dolphins men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of Le Moyne College. The Dolphins compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a member of the Northeast Conference and are currently coached by Nate Champion. The Dolphins have played their home games on Ted Grant Court at the Le Moyne Events Center in DeWitt, New York since 1962. The Dolphins are currently transitioning to Division I and are ineligible to participate in the NCAA tournament until the 2027–28 season.\nHistory.\nBirth of a program (1948–1950).\nThe Dolphins' first varsity basketball game was a home game at the State Fair Coliseum against Siena on December 7, 1948, a 41–39 loss for Le Moyne. Trailing by eight points with seven minutes remaining in the first half, Le Moyne went on a 21–6 run to claim a seven-point lead at the break. The Dolphins came out cold in the second half, scoring just a single basket in the first 16 minutes to surrender the lead. Le Moyne bounced back to tie the game in the final minute, but a buzzer-beating set shot by Roy Peters gave the Indians the victory. The opening game against Siena had been treated by Le Moyne's students as not simply a debut of the Dolphins as a basketball team but as the first game of what was expected to become a heated rivalry. In anticipation of the game, \"BEAT SIENA!\" was the front-page headline of the school newspaper. A pep rally was held the night before the Siena game and attended by the team, the head coach, the athletic director and, of course, the cheerleaders.\nLe Moyne's first head coach was Tommy Niland, who mentored the team for 25 years, until 1973. Niland remained at Le Moyne after his coaching career ended, continuing in his role as the athletic director until his retirement in 1990. Le Moyne's athletics center is named in his honor.\nLe Moyne's first victory came on the road at the Geneva Armory against Hobart on December 10, 1948. Dave Lozo scored three early baskets to give Le Moyne a lead they never relinquished. Coach Niland pulled the Dolphins' starters off the floor midway through the second half with a 22-point lead. Lozo finished the game with 13 points, and team captain Don Savage added 11, as Le Moyne cruised to a 50–37 victory.\nDuring the first three years of its varsity basketball program, Le Moyne was led on the court by Don Savage. Savage had appeared in Le Moyne College's first ever intercollegiate contest on December 4, 1947, a 62–57 overtime victory for the freshman basketball team over Utica. Savage had eight points in that game, while Dave Lozo had a game-high 18 for the Dolphins. Joe Boehm served as captain of that freshman team, which was coached by Tommy Niland in an effort to build the basketball program from the ground up. Niland pulled double duty, serving as coach of both the varsity and freshman teams through the end of the 1949–50 season.\nThe challenge faced by Le Moyne during its inaugural varsity season was unique. The Dolphins were not simply a first-year basketball team; Le Moyne College was a second-year institution. Therefore, the Dolphins were composed entirely of sophomores and faced teams with experienced juniors and seniors in every game.\nMore than halfway through their inaugural season, a 53–31 loss at Siena on January 29, 1949, left the Dolphins with a 5–6 record. A 70–40 home victory over McMaster proved to be the turning point, sparking a five-game winning streak. After losing on a neutral floor to Brockport State in Auburn, New York, the Dolphins won their final two games of the season, both on the road, to make it seven wins in their final eight games and finish 12–7, a respectable mark for an all-sophomore team.\nFollowing a disappointing 1949–50 regular season that saw the Dolphins finish 8–12, Le Moyne was invited to a four-team post-season tournament sponsored by the Utica Optimist Club and played in the Utica Free Academy gymnasium. In the semifinal, the Dolphins avenged a loss earlier in the season by beating Brockport State, 67–60. The following night, Le Moyne found themselves in a tight contest, clinging to a 57–55 lead over Utica, playing on their home court. Captain Don Savage was fouled with about a minute remaining and sank both free throws to extend the Dolphins' lead to four points. Utica scored the game's final basket, but the Dolphins held on for a 59–57 victory and took the tournament title. Savage scored 25 points in the semifinal and 26 in the final to claim the tournament's outstanding player award.\nAside from the victory in the Utica Optimist Club tournament, the highlight of Le Moyne's 1949–50 season was the 40 points scored by Don Savage on December 16, 1949, in a 78–68 loss to St. Francis (NY). The point total was a new high for a Le Moyne player as well as the most points scored by any player in a college or professional game at the State Fair Coliseum.\nFirst national postseason tournament appearances (1950–1958).\nIn June 1950, Le Moyne became a charter member of the Eastern Catholic Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (ECIAC). Earlier in 1950, Le Moyne had declined an invitation to join the conference during its initial formation stage. The major concern was the expected difficulty in scheduling home games, since Le Moyne was sharing the State Fair Coliseum with both the Syracuse Nationals and the Syracuse Orangemen. The ECIAC did not schedule conference games for its members. Instead, teams were expected to schedule at least five conference games in order to be considered in the standings of the league, the champion of which would be determined by winning percentage in conference games. The Dolphins scheduled seven conference matchups for the 1950–51 season, five of which were road games. Shortly before the start of the season, one more home game and one more road game were added to the conference schedule. After only one season, the ECIAC ceased publicizing itself as a conference and became an association of its member schools with no basketball champion crowned, leaving Le Moyne an independent again for 1951–52.\nBy the 1950–51 season, team captain Don Savage was a seasoned senior. Despite efforts to prepare the team, including scheduling preseason scrimmages against the Syracuse Nationals featuring future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer Dolph Schayes, Le Moyne got off to a terrible start, losing their first five games (one of which was against the New York Athletic Club which in 1953, was retroactively erased as a collegiate contest by the Bevo Francis rule) and six of their first seven, all of which were on the road. Savage led the Dolphins to a win over rival Siena, who had beaten Le Moyne in double overtime in the season opener, and the team's fortunes turned from there. It was the first time the Dolphins had ever beaten Siena after five losses. The victory ignited a seven-game winning streak and a run of 10 wins in 11 games, giving the Dolphins an 11–7 record (11–6 in collegiate contests, as retroactively adjusted in 1953).\nThe Dolphins were again invited to participate in the second annual Utica Optimist Club tournament. Le Moyne recorded two blowout victories, first over Utica, which was playing on its home court, 86–69, in the semifinal and then over Hartwick, 86–65, in the title game to secure their second straight tournament championship. Don Savage scored 27 points in the clincher and was named most valuable player. These two wins along with a 20-point home victory over King's in their regular-season finale gave the Dolphins six straight wins and a run of 13 wins in 14 games, pushing their record in collegiate contests to 14–6. As one of the hottest teams in college basketball, Le Moyne was awarded an at-large berth in the prestigious National Catholic Invitational Tournament (NCIT), the program's first major postseason appearance. At the time, it was not unusual for a team to participate in more than one postseason tournament.\nThe 1951 NCIT was played in Albany, New York, in the backyard of rival Siena, which also received an invitation and got a bye to the quarterfinals. In the first round, Don Savage set a new single-game scoring record for an NCIT game with 33 points, and the Dolphins cruised to a 95–67 blowout victory over Saint Michael's.\nThe Dolphins faced Siena, ranked no. 18 in the AP major-program poll, in the quarterfinals in what was essentially a road environment, but Le Moyne came away with a 57–53 victory. A Dave Lozo layup in the second half gave the Dolphins a 32–31 lead they never relinquished. Le Moyne's lead grew as large as nine points, and the Indians continued to claw their way back into the game, but the Dolphins remained in front. Siena's All-America finalist, Billy Harrell was frustrated on the boards by Le Moyne's Joe Endres and guarded ferociously by Billy Jenkins. Harrell finished with only four points. Don Savage led the Dolphins with 20 points.\nDespite 14 points from Don Savage and 12 from Billy Jenkins, the Dolphins fell in the NCIT semifinals, 84–66, to St. Francis (NY). Le Moyne went on to defeat Mount St. Mary's, 63–61, in the third-place game, the final game in the collegiate career of Don Savage, who went on the play parts of two seasons in the NBA with the Syracuse Nationals. The Dolphins had a 61–50 lead with four minutes to play, but Mount St. Mary's went on an 11–0 run to tie the game. Jim Hand's one-handed shot 10 feet from the basket with 13 seconds on the clock provided the winning margin for the Dolphins. Savage was named to the all-tournament first team.\nDuring the 1950–51 season, Don Savage and Dave Lozo became the first Dolphins to reach the 1,000-career-points plateau. Savage was the first to achieve the mark in a home game against Brockport State on January 6. Lozo followed exactly two weeks later, at home against Oswego State.\nIn March 1951, Le Moyne announced it would play its home games during the upcoming season in the new Onondaga County War Memorial. Most of the games would be part of doubleheaders that would also feature Syracuse Orangemen home games.\nIn April 1951, the NCAA granted a blanket waiver allowing freshmen at schools with fewer than 1,000 male students to play varsity basketball to address a manpower shortage caused by the Korean War. Le Moyne opted not to field a freshman team for 1951–52, and allowed freshmen to try out for the varsity team instead. The Dolphins did, however, field a junior varsity team.\nThe Dolphins elected senior Jim Hand and junior Billy Jenkins co-captains for the 1951–52 season. As they had done the previous year, Le Moyne played several scrimmages against the Syracuse Nationals during training camp.\nDespite a disappointing 5–14 regular-season record, Le Moyne was invited to the 1952 Utica Optimist Club tournament for the third straight year. Sparked by Jim Hand's 22 points, the Dolphins rushed to a 21–8 lead at the end of the first quarter and were ahead by 37–16 at halftime, cruising to a 72–42 victory over host Utica in the semifinal. Billy Jenkins had 16 points, while Fred Sheridan added 14, and Hand had 13 to lead the Dolphins to a 72–61 victory over Hartwick in the tournament title game, avenging a loss earlier in the season. Jenkins was named the tournament MVP.\nFollowing the victories in Utica, Le Moyne was invited to the NCIT for the second consecutive season. The 1952 tournament was played in Troy, New York, and Le Moyne's student newspaper speculated that the Dolphins may have been invited, at least in part, because of support shown by their fans the previous year. In the first-round game against Providence, the Dolphins surged ahead in the second quarter after trailing by three points at the end of the first quarter. Dick Shea, who finished with 10 points, fouled out midway through the fourth quarter. A short time later, Jack Young, Billy Jenkins and Fred Sheridan all fouled out, leaving Le Moyne thin on manpower and clinging to a four-point lead. The Dolphins went into a deep freeze for the final three minutes to protect their advantage. Le Moyne waived the free throws on five Friars fouls during this deep freeze in order to maintain possession of the ball. Providence was unable to regain possession, and Le Moyne held on for a 67–63 victory.\nDespite 20 points from Freddy Sheridan, the Dolphins fell in their NCIT quarterfinal game, 75–61, to St. Francis (NY).\nLe Moyne moved its home games to the West Jefferson Street Armory in Syracuse for the 1952–53 season. With the other 1951–52 co-captain, Jim Hand, having graduated, the Dolphins elected senior Billy Jenkins captain for 1952–53. All 11 of Le Moyne's scheduled home games were to be broadcast on WOLF with the station's sports director, Red Parton, doing the play-by-play. Despite an improved 12–8 record in collegiate contests and finding their way through a more difficult schedule than the previous season, Le Moyne did not participate in the 1953 postseason.\nDuring training camp in November 1953, Le Moyne scrimmaged against the Syracuse Nationals, the Syracuse Orange and Cornell. In addition to carrying Le Moyne home games, WOLF also planned to broadcast select Dolphins road games during the 1953–54 season with Red Parton continuing in his role as the play-by-play man. Dick Shea was elected Le Moyne's team captain for the 1953–54 season. Prior to the 1953–54 season, the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) passed a regulation barring freshman from playing varsity basketball, unless the institution had fewer than 500 male students. Le Moyne had fewer than 1,000 male students, the NCAA's criteria for allowing freshmen to play, but more than 500 male students. Although Le Moyne was not yet a member of the ECAC, many of its opponents were. The college decided to voluntarily comply with the ECAC rule to maintain good relations with the conference's members. Don Savage was appointed head coach of the hastily formed freshman team. The Dolphins finished the 1953–54 season 10–6.\nLe Moyne had four of their five regular starters, including leading scorer Dick Kenyon, from the previous season return for 1954–55. The addition of Ron Mack, who had an outstanding season on the freshman team in 1953–54, to the varsity team was highly anticipated. However, Mack suffered torn ligaments in his ankle during a pre-season scrimmage. Patsy Leo, the only senior on the squad, was named team captain for 1954–55.\nFor the first time in team history, the Dolphins won their season opener, 71–57, over Saint Peter's at the West Jefferson Street Armory on December 4, 1954. Bob Dietz scored 21 points, 17 of them coming on free throws, for Le Moyne in the first game the team played under the NCAA's new one-and-one free throw rule. The Dolphins outscored the Peacocks, 35–15, from the charity stripe. Dick Kenyon added 16 points, all coming on field goals, for Le Moyne. Ron Mack did not appear in the game, but he made his varsity debut three days later at Niagara. Kenyon set a new Le Moyne single-game scoring record with 41 points on January 7, 1955, in a home victory over Saint Joseph's. After starting the 1954–55 season 9–3, the Dolphins slumped in February, losing five straight collegiate contests, and finished 11–8.\nIn April 1955, the Dolphins and Syracuse Orange reached an agreement to schedule their home games for the 1955–56 season as doubleheaders at the Onondaga County War Memorial.\nIn June 1955, Le Moyne became a charter member of the new Middle Eastern College Athletic Association (MECAA). The MECAA included teams that were also members of other conferences, a practice not uncommon at the time. When the NCAA split its members into the College Division and University Division in 1956, the MECAA included four teams (St. Francis (NY), Iona, St. Bonaventure and Siena) that were placed into the University Division, while Le Moyne and Saint Peter's were placed into the College Division. St. Francis was also a member of the Metropolitan New York Conference, and St. Bonaventure was also a member of the Western New York Little Three Conference. Nevertheless, all six schools initially continued their affiliation with the MECAA after the split.\nSeniors Dick Kenyon and Lenny Mowins were elected co-captains for the 1955–56 season. Syracuse University radio station WAER began broadcasting all Dolphins home games, all of which were part of doubleheaders that also included Syracuse Orange home games, during the 1955–56 season. Hunter Low, the station's sports director, and John Laudermilch handled the play-by-play.\nAlthough one of the stated goals of the MECAA's founding institutions was to avoid overemphasis on athletics, Le Moyne had its best season on the court up to that point in the inaugural MECAA campaign, their final year in the pre-division NCAA. The Dolphins started the season with seven straight wins in collegiate contests, including two at the Quantico Christmas tournament. After stumbling at mid-season, the Dolphins closed the campaign by winning seven of their final eight games to finish 15–6. Le Moyne's 4–2 conference record fell just short of capturing the MECAA title, which was won by St. Francis (NY), whom the Dolphins did not play, with a record of 4–1. Dick Kenyon became Le Moyne's all-time career points leader, surpassing Don Savage, in a 73–58 home victory over Cortland State on February 29, 1956. Kenyon played four years of varsity basketball, because freshmen were temporarily allowed to play in 1952–53, while Savage was a varsity player for only three seasons. Kenyon's efforts were recognized: he was named a first-team MECAA All-Star, while Bob Dietz was named to the second team.\nSenior Ron Mack was elected team captain for the 1956–57 season. The Dolphins lost two prolific scorers, Dick Kenyon and Bob Dietz, to graduation and were plagued by a rash of injuries, finishing the season 10–9. Four of Le Moyne's losses came against teams that received NIT bids. A fifth loss came at the hands of Saint Michael's, who went to the NCAA College Division tournament. Dolphins senior Don Cavellier was named All-MECAA second team, and Bob Smolinski earned All-MECAA honorable mention.\nLe Moyne ended its agreement with the Syracuse Orangemen to play home games as part of doubleheaders at the Onondaga County War Memorial and moved back to the West Jefferson Street Armory for the 1957–58 season. Senior Frank Bergen was elected team captain. The Dolphins started the season 4–8 but rebounded to finish 11–11 with five of their losses coming against teams that received NIT bids. Le Moyne sophomore Dick Lynch was named All-MECAA first team, and senior John Young earned honorable mention. Lynch set a new record for points scored in a MECAA game on February 21, in an 81–67 loss at Saint Peter's. A printer's error that affected Le Moyne's 1957–58 media guide was presumed to be the reason the MECAA identified Dick Lynch as John Lynch in its press releases.\nGlory era (1958–1968).\nFirst two NCAA tournaments.\nThe 1958–59 season was the start of a golden era for Le Moyne Dolphins basketball. They appeared in six of the 10 NCAA College Division tournaments between 1959 and 1968, reaching the Sweet 16 in 1964. During training camp in November 1958, the outlook was less than rosy. Although Le Moyne's leading scorer, Dick Lynch, was returning for his junior season, the team was thought to be undersized and lacking enough rebounding to be competitive.\nAfter a 58–54 loss at Iona on February 15, 1959, the Dolphins' over all record stood at 11–5, and they were knocked from the MECAA's first-place perch, which they had occupied all season, falling to 3–1 in the league, while Iona stood at 3–0. It was thought by Dolphins followers that impressive wins in the next two games against Hartwick and highly ranked Steubenville would be enough to secure a berth in the NCAA tournament. However, after Le Moyne beat Hartwick, 82–62, on February 18, and Steubenville, 74–56, on February 20, the tournament selection committee remained silent. The Dolphins hit the road for back-to-back games, beating Scranton, 79–67, on February 22, and King's, 67–66, in overtime the following night. These two victories improved the team's record to 15–5 and were enough for the Dolphins to get the call from the Middle Atlantic States regional selectors, earning their first berth in the NCAA College Division tournament.\nBefore the NCAA tournament, there remained unfinished business in the MECAA, specifically a home game against archrival Siena. Iona had beaten St. Francis (NY) at Madison Square Garden on February 26, to improve their league record to 4–0 with one conference game remaining at Saint Peter's. The Siena-Le Moyne game and the Iona-Saint Peter's game were both scheduled for February 28. A Le Moyne win and an Iona loss would give both teams a 4–1 MECAA record and a share of the conference title, even though Le Moyne had lost its head-to-head matchup with Iona. Aside from their desire to go undefeated in the league and win the MECAA crown outright, Iona was thought to be on the bubble for a bid to the NCAA tournament and desperately needed a win.\nThe Peacocks gained a 73–60 victory over the Gaels to finish 3–1 in MECAA play and drop Iona to 4–1. Le Moyne had an eight-point lead with four minutes to play against Siena, but the Indians stormed back and cut the Dolphins' lead to one point with two minutes to play. Le Moyne tried to freeze the ball for the remainder of the game to protect the lead, but a steal by Jerry Brehm, who had 25 points, gave Siena possession with a minute and a half on the clock. Siena went into a deep freeze to hold for the final shot, which came from Jack Weaver and fell short with two seconds to go, giving the Dolphins a 60–59 victory and a share of the MECAA title, the first conference championship in the program's history. Iona's loss to Saint Peter's may have cost the Gaels an NCAA tournament bid. St. Bonaventure had withdrawn from the MECAA just as the 1958–59 season was getting under way. The Brown Indians only had four games scheduled against MECAA opponents. St. Bonaventure ultimately won all four of those contests.\nLe Moyne entered the postseason 17–5 and ranked no. 20 nationally (tied with Stetson) in the small college coaches' poll. The Dolphins won their first ever NCAA tournament game, 72–66, over Williams in Burlington, Vermont. Dick Lynch led Le Moyne with 33 points, shooting 14-for-22 from the floor.\nIn the Regional Final Sweet 16 game, Le Moyne fell short, 71–70, against Saint Michael's, who was ranked no. 15 in the small college coaches' poll and playing on their home court. Saint Michael's had led by as many as nine points and was on top, 71–64, with 1:16 on the clock. Le Moyne used a full-court press to get back into the game, and Dick Lynch, who had 20 points, was fouled with 23 seconds to play and the Dolphins down, 71–68, but he missed both free throws. After Ralph St. Peter missed the front end of a one-and-one for Saint Michael's, the Dolphins collected the rebound and called timeout with four seconds remaining. Denny Morrissey drove to the basket in the hopes of drawing a foul. He scored at the buzzer, but there was no foul, and the Dolphins lost by a point. Three of Le Moyne's six losses during the 1958–59 season came at the hands of Saint Michael's, all in Burlington. Lynch was unanimously named to the All-Regional team.\nLe Moyne junior Dick Lynch was named to the All-MECAA first team for the second straight year. Senior Bob Hollembaek made the second team, and sophomore Chuck Sammons earned honorable mention. Dolphins head coach Tommy Niland was unanimously selected as 1959 MECAA coach of the year.\nDick Lynch, the Dolphins' leading scorer the previous two years, returned for his senior season in 1959–60, but Le Moyne lost three regular starters to graduation. Junior Chuck Sammons was the other returning starter. Lynch was named team captain.\nSporting an 11–3 record in collegiate contests, including impressive home wins over Saint Michael's and Iona and a road victory at St. Francis (NY), the Dolphins were offered a berth in the NCAA tournament on February 23. The team was on the road at the time and recorded another victory over St. Lawrence that night, before accepting the bid the following day.\nBefore moving on to the NCAA tournament, Le Moyne had a home game with archrival Siena, and a win would clinch at least a tie for the MECAA title. An Iona home loss against Saint Peter's that same night along with a Dolphins victory would give Le Moyne the MECAA championship outright. The Peacocks did their part, beating the Gaels, 67–57. Although the Dolphins were less efficient on offense than they had been in recent home games, they recorded their 20th consecutive home victory, 61–48, over the Indians to win the MECAA crown outright. However, the win came at a great cost. Early in the game, Dolphins captain and leading scorer, Dick Lynch, collided with Jim Mannix of Siena and twisted his ankle. Lynch was removed from the game but returned and played until the closing minutes, when the outcome was no longer in doubt. Later, it was learned that the ankle injury would impair Lynch's ability to participate in the NCAA tournament.\nThe 1960 NCAA tournament's Northeast Regional was hosted by St. Michael's in Burlington, Vermont, as it had been the previous year. It was there that the Dolphins met Saint Anselm in the regional semifinals on March 3. Le Moyne and Saint Anselm had coincidentally been scheduled to play each other in Syracuse on March 1, but the teams cancelled the game when they were matched up in the tournament. Playing without Dick Lynch, the Dolphins fell behind early, 10–1. Saint Anselm stretched the lead to 24–13, and junior Chuck Sammons was called for his fourth personal foul with eight minutes to play in the first half. The Burlington Memorial Auditorium erupted in cheers from all sides, when coach Tommy Niland replaced Sammons with Lynch, who was clearly hobbled and in obvious pain. Two minutes later, Lynch was taken out of the game. A Dolphins flurry led by Bill Stanley, who had 22 points in the game, in the final minute of the first half cut the Saint Anselm lead to seven points. Sammons, who finished with 10 points, finally fouled out with eight minutes to play, and John Caveny was disqualified three minutes later with the Dolphins trailing, 76–69. Saint Anselm controlled the final five minutes of the game to put away an 88–75 victory. The Dolphins and their fans were left to wonder what could have been.\nThe following night, the Dolphins lost the regional third-place game to Assumption, 94–68, to finish fourth in the region. Bill Stanley had 20 points in the consolation game and was named to the All-Regional second team.\nLe Moyne's head coach, Tommy Niland, was unanimously chosen as 1960 MECAA coach of the year. Niland was also named Catholic small college coach of the year. Dick Lynch was named a MECAA All-Star. John Caveny and Bill Stanley were both named All-MECAA second team. The 1959–60 Dolphins were inducted into the Le Moyne College Athletic Hall of Fame as a team in 2011.\nSeniors Tommy Burns and Chuck Sammons were named co-captains of the 1960–61 Dolphins. Le Moyne lost only one player from the previous season's starting lineup, but that player was Dick Lynch, the captain, leading scorer and among the best players in the program's history.\nUp to the 1959–60 season, some MECAA teams did not play full round-robin conference schedules, and others played each conference opponent with home-and-home series versus some but not all conference members. The uneven scheduling created controversy about which team deserved the championship in cases where it had been decided in favor of a team that had scheduled one extra or one fewer game, since the conference title was awarded based on winning percentage against conference opponents. St. Francis (NY) had won the 1955–56 conference championship with a 4–1 record, while both Le Moyne and St. Bonaventure were 4–2 versus conference opponents that season. In both 1959 and 1960, Saint Peter's had finished with a conference record of 3–1, one-half game behind the MECAA champions each year. To address this perceived inequity, the MECAA staged the 1960 Christmas tournament, which was originally planned to be held annually in December to determine a champion with all conference teams on equal footing. The MECAA had six members at the time: Le Moyne, St. Francis (NY), Iona, King's, Saint Peter's and Siena. King's was not eligible for the 1959–60 regular-season MECAA championship, since it joined the conference shortly before the start of the season and had only three games scheduled against MECAA members; King's did not participate in the Christmas tournament. Therefore, three other teams (Fairleigh Dickinson, Long Island and Wagner) were invited to create an eight-team bracket and ensure the tournament champion would need to win three games.\nThe Dolphins drew host Saint Peter's in the MECAA tournament quarterfinal. The Dolphins entered the game 5–0 on the season, and the Peacocks were riding a five-game winning steak. In a game that was tight throughout, Saint Peter's took a 62–61 lead with 1:06 to play. John Caveny's basket with 46 seconds to go gave Le Moyne a 63–62 lead. After an empty possession for the Peacocks, Bill Stanley, who had a game-high 22 points, hit a free throw to extend the Dolphins' lead to two points with four seconds on the clock. Saint Peter's got off a long shot at the buzzer, but it missed, and Le Moyne held on for a 64–62 victory.\nThe second-half rebounding work of John Cavney and Chuck Sammons allowed Le Moyne to pull away from Iona, after leading by just four points at the break, and take a 90–60 victory. Cavney led the Dolphins with 23 points. Bill Stanley had 16 points, and Tom Burns added 15 for Le Moyne, who scored 54 points in the second half.\nLe Moyne defeated Long Island in the final, 66–57, to claim the MECAA tournament title on December 29, 1960. Bill Smith of Saint Peter's was voted the tournament's most valuable player.\nDespite the initial plans, the 1960 Christmas tournament was the only tournament the MECAA ever held. The tournament was unique, since it could be differentiated from a conference tournament, because it was not held at the end of the season and included non-member teams. It also does not resemble an in-season multiple-team event, since five of the six MECAA teams participated rather than limiting tournament entries to one team per conference.\nPrior to the 1960–61 season, Siena moved from the NCAA's University Division to the College Division. This left the MECAA with two University Division teams (St. Francis (NY) and Iona) and four College Division teams (Le Moyne, Siena, Saint Peter's and King's).\nOff to an undefeated 8–0 start and riding a 22-game home winning streak, Le Moyne was stunned at home, 83–68, by Saint Anselm on January 6, 1961. The Dolphins' previous home loss had been a 65–50 drubbing at the hands of St. Bonaventure on February 5, 1958. Tom Burns had 20 points for Le Moyne in the Saint Anselm game.\nIn early January, Le Moyne was ranked no. 13 in the country among all Catholic schools. This ranking included both University Division and College Division institutions. However, the Dolphins fell out of the rankings after the loss to Saint Anselm.\nThe MECAA awarded its regular-season championship for the 1960–61 season to the team with the best winning percentage against conference opponents, excluding games played during the Christmas tournament. The title was again decided by the result of an extra game. The final game of the season between conference opponents matched Iona and Siena with Iona and Saint Peter's tied for first place at 3–1. Siena's upset victory over Iona, who had given Saint Peter's their only conference loss, dropped the Gaels' record to 3–2 and gave the Peacocks the championship. Had Le Moyne defeated Saint Peter's on February 21, the Dolphins would have won their third straight league championship. Le Moyne suffered a home loss in that game, 68–61.\nThe Dolphins were slowed by injuries and slumped in the later part of the season, losing four of their final six games, and finished 16–7 in collegiate contests.\nLe Moyne's Bill Stanley was unanimously named a 1961 MECAA All-Star. John Caveny and Tom Burns were named second team MECAA All-Stars.\nBill Stanley and John Caveny returned to the Dolphins for their senior seasons in 1961–62, and were named co-captains. The previous season's co-captains, Tommy Burns and Chuck Sammons, were lost to graduation. The Dolphins had anticipated moving into their newly constructed fieldhouse during the 1961–62 season, with their February 5 game against Providence the target for the opening of the venue. However, by November 1961, construction delays made it apparent that this would not happen, and Le Moyne played all their home games at the West Jefferson Street Armory.\nStarting with the 1961–62 season, the MECAA began to play a round-robin schedule with each team playing one conference game against each other member. If conference members scheduled more than one game against each other, one game was designated in advance as the game that would count in the conference standings. This system continued for the remainder of the MECAA's existence, except for a few instances in which conference games could not be scheduled or needed to be cancelled.\nA fiercely contested 61–58 overtime win at home against Iona on January 27, gave the Dolphins an 8–2 record and put them in first place in the MECAA with a 2–0 league mark. The Gaels had control of the game until the middle stage of the second half, when Le Moyne went on a run sparked by the pressure defense applied by Tom Cooney and the scoring of Bill Stanley. With the score tied at 54 late in regulation, the Dolphins went into a deep freeze, holding the ball for the final shot. Stanley's shot was off the mark, sending the game to overtime. A Stanley jump shot, after retrieving a jump ball, with a minute and a half to play in the extra session put Le Moyne in front, 60–58. After a missed jump shot by Iona, the Dolphins collected the rebound with one minute on the clock and froze the ball. The Gaels fouled with ten seconds to go, and Stanley hit a free throw to complete the scoring.\nA week later, the Dolphins suffered their first home loss of the season, a 59–52 defeat at the hands of Gannon, despite 18 points from Bill Stanley and 16 from John Caveny. Le Moyne trailed most of the second half but cut the Golden Knights' lead to 50–48 inside the final two minutes. Al Lawson's tip-in extended Gannon's lead and put the game out of reach.\nTwo days later, the Dolphins hosted reigning NIT champion Providence in a game that was originally planned to celebrate the grand opening of their new fieldhouse. Bob Yahn did an admirable job rebounding with Providence stars Jim Hadnot and John Thompson, and Le Moyne's defense swarmed around the Friars' big men. Tom Cooney's ball hawking on Providence point guard Vincent Ernst was disruptive and kept the Dolphins in the game. After Le Moyne started hot and raced to an early 10–0 lead, Providence did not find themselves in front until 17 minutes into the game and held a slim two-point edge at the break. The Friars opened the second half with an 8–0 run to extend their lead to 10 points, and the Dolphins were unable to get back into the game the rest of the way, falling 53–46. Despite their defensive efforts, Le Moyne was unable to stop Ray Flynn, who had 22 points on 10-for-16 shooting from the floor for Providence.\nThe home losses against Gannon and Providence were the start of a second-half slide that saw the Dolphins lose seven of their final 12 games to finish the season 13–9. By the time Le Moyne dropped a 64–62 overtime decision at home to Saint Michael's on February 17, which left the Dolphins with an 11–6 record, hopes for an NCAA tournament berth had faded.\nDespite their late-season struggles, the Dolphins continued to play well in MECAA games and had an opportunity to clinch at least share of the league title, if they could get a home victory over King's on March 2. Bill Stanley and John Caveny exploded for 30 and 27 points, respectively, to lead Le Moyne to an 83–51 romp over King's and guarantee the Dolphins no worse than a tie for the MECAA championship with a 4–1 league record. Leading by seven points at the break, Le Moyne started the second half with a 14–6 run to push their bulge to 15 points. By the midpoint of the second half, the Dolphins held a 66–38 lead over the Monarchs. With no doubt remaining about the outcome, Stanley, playing his final collegiate game, reached a career total of 999 points. The crowd of 1,100 fans was breathless as Stanley went to the line and missed both free throws with 7:30 to play. Two minutes later, Stanley was fouled again; this time, he hit both free throws to become the seventh player in program history to break through the 1,000-point barrier. Earlier in the season, Caveny had also topped 1,000 points, and he finished his career with 1,069. Ralph Yahn had a strong game, finishing with 10 points and 11 rebounds. Stanley had 11 rebounds to go with his point total.\nWith their season completed, the Dolphins became spectators, and the team to watch was archrival Siena. The Indians won their ninth straight game, a streak which included a non-conference victory at Le Moyne, on March 6, when they routed Saint Peter's, 77–54, in their home finale. The loss eliminated the Peacocks from contention for the MECAA title. Siena was the last remaining MECAA team with only one loss and could claim a share of the MECAA championship with a win at Iona on March 10. Coincidentally, Iona had been denied the MECAA title the previous season, when the Gaels were upset at Siena in their season finale. Iona got its revenge, beating the Indians, 73–59, to give Le Moyne the outright MECAA championship.\nThe MECAA named Bill Stanley 1962 most valuable player and Tommy Niland coach of the year. It was the first time a Le Moyne player had earned a conference MVP award and the third MECAA coach of the year honor for Niland. It was Stanley's second straight MECAA All-Star selection. John Caveny was named to the MECAA All-Star second team.\nBy September 1962, the construction of Le Moyne's new fieldhouse was completed. Initially, it was referred to as the Le Moyne Athletic Center.\nMickey Flynn and Chris Pitman were named co-captains of the 1962–63 team. The Dolphins lost their previous season's co-captains, John Caveny, who was second-team all-conference, and MECAA MVP Bill Stanley to graduation, but several rotation players returned, including Ralph Yahn, Dick Myers, Bob Yahn and Tom Cooney.\nThe first intercollegiate contest in the new Le Moyne Athletic Center was the Dolphins' season opener against their archrival and MECAA opponent, Siena, on December 1, 1962. A crowd of 2,100 witnessed the return of former Le Moyne moderator of athletics, Rev. Vincent B. Ryan, S.J., who was on hand to throw out the first ball in a pre-game ceremony. John McGrath, who finished with a game-high 19 points, hit a jump shot to give Le Moyne a 2–0 lead and score the first points in the new arena. The Dolphins' pressure defense, led by Tom Cooney, forced Siena into turnovers and fueled the offense, putting Le Moyne in front, 23–15 at the half.\nDuring the intermission, Rev. John J. O'Brien, S.J., who was the current moderator of athletics, introduced Le Moyne's first team, which played Siena in the program's inaugural game in 1948, former team captains and members of the Dolphins' 1,000 career points club. Former players on hand for the festivities included Don Savage, Lou Donahue, Joe Boehm, Bob Hurley, Dave Lozo, Dick Riley, Patsy Leo, Len Mowins, Dick Kenyon, Ron Mack, Denny Morissey, Dick Lynch, John Caveney and Bill Stanley. Syracuse mayor William Walsh was also present.\nWhen the action resumed, the Indians came out flying, opening the second half with a 10–2 run to erase Le Moyne's lead and tie the game at 25 in only five minutes. Siena extended the run to 18–5 to push ahead, 33–28. Midway through the second half, Dick Myers fouled out, the Dolphins trailed 37–33, and Siena appeared to have the momentum. The Indians answered each of Le Moyne's next two baskets with one of their own and led, 41–37, with 3:14 to play. McGrath drew a foul and hit both free throws to cut Siena's lead to two points. After an empty Indians possession, Chris Pitman was fouled and knocked down both shots to tie the game at 41 with just over two minutes to play. Siena's Paul Thorpe missed a layup inside the 1:50 mark, and Pitman grabbed the rebound. The Dolphins froze the ball, holding for the final shot, until Mickey Flynn's 12-footer from the left side fell through the hoop with five seconds left, giving Le Moyne a 6–0 run and a 43–41 lead. The Indians' final desperation shot was blocked by the Dolphins, sealing the Le Moyne victory. Flynn finished the game with nine points.\nThe Dolphins' first four games of the 1962–63 season were at home, and Le Moyne won all four. The Dolphins opened the road portion of their schedule with another victory to improve to 5–0. However, a five-game mid-season losing streak dropped the Dolphins' record to 6–6. In the final game of that streak, the Dolphins fell behind, 49–33, early in the second half at Saint Michael's before going on a 12–0 run, which they extended to 18–3, to cut the lead to 52–51. However, the Knights outscored Le Moyne, 22–5, over the final 10 minutes to secure a 74–56 win.\nLe Moyne broke the losing streak with an impressive home win over St. Francis (NY), a team that would end up playing in the NIT, on February 2, 1963. Although the Terriers never led in the game, the Dolphins were unable to hold the 10-point halftime lead they built with pressure defense, transition baskets and outside shooting. St. Francis applied pressure defense of their own in the second half and forced turnovers. The Dolphins began to shoot poorly from the free-throw line. Suddenly, a game that seemed well in hand for Le Moyne was tied at 50 with five minutes to play. In the closing moments of regulation, with the score tied at 56, Mickey Flynn, who finished with a game-high 20 points, missed a potential game winner, sending the game to overtime. Flynn redeemed himself with two straight jump shots early in the extra session to give the Dolphins a four-point lead. The Terriers fouled to regain possession, and Le Moyne recovered their free-throw shooting touch, scoring their final five points from the charity stripe. Two late Terriers baskets came after the game was out of reach, and the Dolphins earned a 65–64 victory.\nThe Dolphins finished 1962–63 with a 12–10 record in collegiate contests. Mickey Flynn was named All-MECAA first team.\nThree straight NCAA tournament bids (1963–1966).\nSeniors Ralph Yahn and Tom Cooney were named co-captains for the 1963–64 season. The Dolphins sputtered to a 3–4 record in their first seven games. Things started to turn around, when Le Moyne visited a pair of MECAA foes in the New York metropolitan area. In Jersey City, Le Moyne dominated Saint Peter's, 86–71, on January 10, 1964, to even their over all record at 4–4 and their MECAA mark at 1–1. Dan Frawley had a game-high 21 points to the Dolphins, who had four players in double figures. After the Peacocks had an early 15–14 lead, Le Moyne pushed ahead for good and never looked back.\nThe following day, the Dolphins met St. Francis (NY) at the 69th Regiment Armory in Manhattan. After falling behind, 3–0, Le Moyne went on a 13–0 run to move ahead and held the lead the rest of the way. The Dolphins again had four players in double figures in the scoring column, led by sophomore Gary DeYulia, who posted 14 points.\nThe Dolphins took control of their January 18 game at Alfred in the second half and went on to a 70–66 victory. Gary DeYulia had 22 points for Le Moyne, and Tom Cooney added 20.\nAfter watching a 40–26 halftime lead disappear in their January 25 home game against Saint Michael's, as the Knights second-half switch to a zone defense seemed to confuse Le Moyne, the Dolphins fought back and recovered their outside shooting touch to get back into the game. Le Moyne outscored Saint Michael's, 6–2, in the closing moments to secure a 75–71 victory, their fourth straight. All five Dolphins starters scored in double figures, led by Gary DeYulia's 18 points.\nThe Dolphins took over first-place in the MECAA with a 3–1 record with a dominant home win over Iona on February 1. Le Moyne scored the first five points of the second half to extend their six-point halftime lead. The Gaels never got closer than seven points behind the rest of the way, and the Dolphins cruised to a 74–56 victory. Gary DeYulia led Le Moyne with 28 points. Tom Cooney and Dick Myers had 19 points each.\nFollowing an 87–56 home win over Clarkson, the Dolphins clinched at least a share of the MECAA title with a 54–46 win at Siena, their seventh straight victory. Le Moyne pulled away from the Indians with a 6–0 run late in the first half to extend their lead to eight points, and Siena never got closer than four points behind the rest of the way. Gary DeYulia led the Dolphins with a game-high 15 points.\nAfter pulling away from St. Lawrence late on the road and cruising to an 85–69 win, the Dolphins journeyed to Massachusetts for a pair of road games with their eight-game winning streak inspiring talk of a possible bid to the NCAA tournament, provided their trip was successful.\nThe Dolphins fell behind early at Stonehill on February 14, but recovered on the strength of Gary DeYulia's scoring to get back into the game. The teams battled back and forth until Dick Munson's jump shot in the closing seconds broke a tie and gave the Chieftains a 53–51 lead. Le Moyne called timeout with just three seconds to play. The ensuing inbounds pass went to DeYulia, who drained a 35-footer at the buzzer to send the game to overtime. The Chieftains suffocated DeYulia during the extra session, but an offensive rebound put-back by Dick Myers put the Dolphins in front. Tom Cooney hit a jump shot and followed that with a steal and a layup. Le Moyne held on for a 61–58 triumph, their ninth straight victory. DeYulia finished with 35 points.\nThe following night, the Dolphins visited Assumption, who were ranked no. 6 in the College Division media poll at the time. After Le Moyne had a one-point lead at halftime, Assumption opened the second half with an 18–4 run over the first seven minutes and later extended their lead to 16 points. The Dolphins chipped away at the lead during the later stages of the second half and cut the deficit to four points with 10 seconds to go. However, Assumption hit their free throws and scored a basket in the closing moments to secure a 74–66 victory.\nIona had a 13-point lead with seven minutes to play, when they hosted Saint Peter's on February 22. The Gaels, facing the pressure of a possible NIT bid, fell apart down the stretch and suffered a home loss, 68–66, on Tim Kehoe's buzzer-beater. The Iona loss dropped them to 3–2 in MECAA play and gave Le Moyne the 1964 MECAA championship outright.\nFollowers of the Dolphins thought the loss to Assumption might keep Le Moyne out of the NCAA tournament. However, the Dolphins' 65–63 late-season victory at Buffalo ended the Bulls' 45-game home winning streak. It was the Dolphins fourth straight win and 13th in their previous 14 games. That was enough to capture the selection committee's attention and secure an invitation to the NCAA tournament.\nLe Moyne entered to the NCAA tournament with a 17–5 regular-season record and winners of five straight and 14 of their previous 15 games. The Dolphins were matched with Youngstown State, ranked no. 6 nationally in the Associated Press College Division poll at the time, in the regional semifinals. Le Moyne's stifling defense, fierce rebounding and hot shooting led to a six-point burst in just a minute and a half that put them ahead, 54–44, with 4:08 to play, and their lead never fell below 10 points for the rest of the game. Gary DeYulia shot 8 for 12 and had a game-high 20 points. As a team, the Dolphins shot 57% from the floor, while their zone defense limited the Penguins to 39% shooting.\nThe Dolphins met Akron, the region's top seed, who were playing at home in the Mideast Regional Final Sweet 16 game. The Zips scored early and often. Meanwhile, it took six and a half minutes for the Dolphins to put their first points on the board. Akron dominated the game from start to finish, winning by a score of 62–38. Akron's defense frustrated Le Moyne's top scorer Gary DeYulia, who finished with six points on 2-for-15 shooting. Le Moyne's Tom Cooney was named to the All-Regional team. Cooney had 24 points in the two tournament games.\nTommy Niland was named 1964 MECAA coach of the year, the fourth time he was so honored. Gary DeYulia was named All-MECAA first team, and Tom Cooney was selected for the second team. De Yulia was also named an ECAC All-Star.\nIn April 1964, Le Moyne College announced that it would sponsor and participate in a four-team Christmas invitational basketball tournament to take place on December 29 and 30. Buffalo had already committed to participate. Le Moyne athletic director and men's basketball coach would serve as the tournament director.\nThe Dolphins lost three seniors (Ralph Yahn, Tom Cooney and Dick Lynch) to graduation for the 1964–65 season, but leading scorer Gary DeYula returned along with Dan Frawley, the team's second leading rebounder. Dick Martyns and Jerry Glose, both of whom played well in limited action the previous season, also returned. Tom Mullen lost weight during the offseason and was expected to compete for the starting center role. Frawley and Dan Lawler were named co-captains.\nThe Dolphins were coming off a home loss to Hartwick and were 2–2 on the young season as their Christmas invitational tournament got under way. In the opening game, Saint Michael's outscored Buffalo, 93–86, setting a new venue record for most combined points by two teams in the brief history of the Le Moyne Athletic Center. The Dolphins took an early 21–8 lead, which they increased to 40–24 by halftime, against Oswego State on their way to an 81–64 victory. Gary DeYulia led Le Moyne with 18 points. Tom Mullen and Dan Frawley both had double-doubles with each player collecting 10 rebounds to go with 17 points for Mullen and 15 for Frawley.\nThe following evening, Buffalo defeated Oswego State, 88–59, in the tournament consolation game. Tom Mullen's solid guarding held Purple Knight Richie Tarrant, who entered the contest averaging more than 32 points per game, to just 19 points. Gary DeYulia was exceptionally efficient on offense, scoring a game-high 22 points on 11-for-12 shooting from the floor. Dan Frawley had a double-double with 13 points and 13 rebounds. Despite how well the Dolphins performed, the lead changed hands several times, and Le Moyne found themselves with a one-point advantage at 64–63 with 1:09 to play. A Frawley layup extended the lead to three points. Tarrant hit a free throw to cut the Dolphins' lead to two. Dick Reece scored just four points in the game for the Dolphins, but two of them came by hitting both ends of a one-and-one with 45 seconds to play to give Le Moyne a four-point lead. Tarrant fouled out on the play. Saint Michael's got a pair of free throws with 30 seconds left, but the Dolphins were able to run out the clock and secure a 68–66 victory and the tournament championship. DeYulia was named the tournament's most valuable player and presented a trophy by the Very Rev. William Reilly, S.J., president of Le Moyne College. Coach Tommy Niland accepted the tournament championship trophy from the Greater Syracuse Chamber of Commerce on behalf of the team.\nThe Christmas tournament turned out to be the launching point of a record-breaking Dolphins winning streak, which reached 10 games, the longest in program history, when Le Moyne defeated St. Francis (NY), 53–46, on February 6. Three straight baskets by Dick Martyns broke open a close game and gave the Dolphins a 48–38 lead with four minutes to go. Le Moyne used a pressing defense to frustrate the Terriers, who had a three-inch average height advantage. St. Francis shot just 29% from the floor. Gary DeYulia led the Dolphins with 17 points. Tom Mullen had a double-double with 12 points and 11 rebounds. Gerry Glose had two key rebounds in the final minutes, as the Terriers tried to get back into the game, and also contributed seven points. A crowd of 2,200 was heard chanting \"N-C-A-A\" as the game drew to a conclusion. The win improved Le Moyne's record to 12–2.\nThe Dolphins' winning streak hit 13 on February 17, when they drubbed Hobart, 85–43, despite the absence of their top two scorers, Gary DeYulia and Tom Mullen, who were both nursing colds. Dick Reece led Le Moyne with 16 points.\nGary DeYulia and Tom Mullen returned to the lineup for the Dolphins' 91–68 blowout victory over Alfred, who came into the game 14–5, on February 20. Mullen had a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds but appeared to suffer an ankle injury during the game. DeYulia led Le Moyne with 17 points. Ed Mandell had 31 points for the Saxons, who came into the game averaging 85 points per contest, but were held to 31% shooting from the floor by the Dolphins' defense. Le Moyne's 14th straight win improved their record to 16–2 and inspired the crowd of 2,000 spectators to yell \"N-C-A-A\" throughout the game in anticipation of a bid to the tournament.\nOn February 23, Le Moyne received and accepted a bid to host the Northeast Regionals of the 1965 NCAA College Division tournament. Aside from the Dolphins' 16–2 record, the selection committee cited the outstanding support shown by both students and area residents for the Dolphins at recent games as well as during the Christmas tournament. Le Moyne head coach Tommy Niland was named tournament director for the regional. Le Moyne announced that tickets could be reserved by phone starting at 9 a.m. on February 24, and would be available for pick-up on February 27. Student passes would not be honored for the tournament games; however, students could purchase tickets at a discounted price of $1.50 for each doubleheader session. Reserved tickets were priced at $2 per doubleheader session or $3.50 for all four games. General admission bleacher tickets were available for $1.50 per night. Le Moyne rented portable bleachers from the West Jefferson Street Armory to expand seating capacity for the tournament by about 500. Since the tournament bid created a conflict, the Dolphins rescheduled their home game against Siena from March 6 to February 28. Coach Niland appointed Manlius Military Academy athletic director and basketball coach Whitey Anderson as official scorer for the tournament games. Incredibly, all these arrangements were announced by Le Moyne the same day the selection committee announced it had been chosen to host the regional. Le Moyne also announced that the foot injury Tom Mullen suffered in the game against Alfred would keep him out of the February 24 game against Clarkson. Coach Niland hoped that Mullen would be available for the February 27 game at Buffalo.\nGerry Glose came off the bench to score 18 points on 7-for-11 shooting to lead the Dolphins to a 61–51 victory at Clarkson on February 24. Gary DeYulia, slowed by a calf injury, had 18 points for Le Moyne, who won their 15th straight game and improved to 17–2 on the season.\nNorb Baschnagel's basket with three minutes to play gave Buffalo a 58–57 lead over Le Moyne at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium on February 27. After an empty possession for the Dolphins, two free throws put the Bulls ahead by three points, and they held on to win, 62–59, ending Le Moyne's program-record 15-game winning streak. Buffalo improved to 16–2 with the win, as they prepared for the NCAA tournament. Gary DeYulia had 26 points for the Dolphins, who dropped to 17–3 on the season.\nThe Dolphins struggled at the start of their regular-season finale against Siena on February 28, failing to score a basket until 9:35 had elapsed on the clock. Le Moyne recovered to take a five-point halftime lead. The Indians got within two points at 42–40 midway through the second half, but baskets by Mike Lawler and Tom Mullen extended the lead. Moments later, Dan Cunha was hit with a technical foul for arguing a call. The ensuing free throw and another charity toss on the personal foul extended the Dolphins' lead to 49–42, and Le Moyne went on to a 58–48 victory. After Gary DeYulia felt he was unnecessarily shoved out of bounds, a brief melee broke out between the rival teams, and a Siena player was promptly slammed to the floor by a Dolphin. It appeared it might spread into the stands where the Siena fans were sitting, but cooler heads quickly prevailed. DeYulia finished the game with just six points on 2-for-20 shooting from the floor. Eric Pitman led the Dolphins with 10 points. The behavior of the Le Moyne players and fans in connection with the melee was criticized in Siena's school newspaper.\nBefore the Siena game, Saint Michael's, Hartwick and Assumption were announced as the other three teams participating in the Northeast Regionals. A few hours after the regional field was announced, all tickets were sold out. The Dolphins defeated Saint Michael's, 68–66, at home in the Christmas tournament and on the road, 65–64, on January 23. Le Moyne earned a home victory over Assumption, 76–73, on February 13. Hartwick handed Le Moyne their only home loss of the regular season, 60–53, on December 16.\nBefore the start of the 1964–65 season, Saint Peter's moved up from the NCAA's College Division to the University Division, giving the MECAA three University Division teams (St. Francis (NY), Iona and Saint Peter's) and three College Division teams (Le Moyne, Siena and King's). Mark Palinski scored 28 points to lead Siena to an 80–72 victory over Saint Peter's on March 2. The University Division Peacocks fell to 2–2 in MECAA play with the loss to the College Division Indians and were eliminated from the league title race, giving Le Moyne its second consecutive outright conference championship.\nAssumption executed a suffocating defensive effort, frustrating the Dolphins and earning a 76–58 victory. Le Moyne trailed by 16 at halftime and spent most of the game in foul trouble. The Dolphins' leading scorer, Gary DeYulia, scored Le Moyne's first four points on a layup and a jump shot but was shut down by the Greyhounds the rest of the way, finishing with just four points. Trailing 48–27 in the second half, Tom Mullen, who had 18 points in the game, scored six points during a 10–0 Dolphins run, but Le Moyne never got closer than 11 points behind the Greyhounds.\nIn the regional third-place game, Gary DeYulia's steal and transition basket capped a run that gave the Dolphins a 53–51 lead and thrilled the crowd in the Le Moyne Athletic Center. Hartwick responded immediately with a run of their own to go ahead by 64–56. Le Moyne fought back led by Eric Pitman and Dick Martyns and had the ball down by two points with 31 seconds to play. However, the Warriors' defense held on for a 70–68 victory. DeYulia and Tom Mullin led the Dolphins with 17 points each.\nGary DeYulia was named a 1965 ECAC first-team All-Star.\nSenior Gary DeYulia, the Dolphins' leading scorer the previous two seasons, was named captain of the 1965–66 squad. Tom Mullen, Le Moyne's second leading scorer from the 1964–65 season, returned for his senior season. Senior Gerry Glose and junior Eric Pitman, both of whom were part of the previous season's rotation were expected to play significant roles. The Dolphins lost five players to graduation: Dan Frawley, Dan Lawler, Dick Martyns, Dick Reece and Michael Downey. During the pre-season, coach Tommy Niland expected the Dolphins to have more speed and be less physical than the previous season's team. He planned to have the team increase its pace on offense to take advantage of its strengths.\nThe Dolphins' 1965–66 schedule released prior to the season indicated they would host a second annual Christmas invitational tournament in December 1965. Teams committed to participate were Hartwick, Kenyon and Southwest Texas State. Le Moyne entered the tournament with a 3–0 record. In their semifinal game against Kenyon, Eric Pitman, who finished with 17 points, scored all the Dolphins' points during a 7–2 run that extended a 61–56 lead to 68–58. Pitman got the run started by cashing in on a free throw, after he was fouled while hitting a layup. After Kenyon scored on a put-back, Pitman took a pass from Gary DeYulia and drove the lane for another layup. DeYulia, who led the Dolphins with 24 points, then blocked a Kenyon shot. Pitman picked up the loose ball and raced down the floor, and Le Moyne was on its way to an 84–73 victory.\nIn the tournament final, the Dolphins met Hartwick, a team that had beaten them twice during the previous season, including a game at the Le Moyne Athletic Center in the NCAA tournament. Neither team had a lead larger than six points, and the game went down to the wire. Eric Pitman scored to tie the game at 51 with 2:12 to play. After the Warriors turned the ball over on a three-second violation, Pitman missed a driving layup, and Hartwick grabbed the rebound. With just 24 seconds to play, Dan Parham, who had a game-high 19 points and was named tournament MVP, was fouled. Parham missed the first free throw but made the second to give Hartwick a 52–51 lead. DeYulia's shot from the left of the key was off the mark, but he snatched his own rebound near the foul line and hit a jump shot with one second on the clock to give the Dolphins a 53–52 victory. Tom Mullen led Le Moyne with 15 points, and DeYulia added 13.\nThe only blemish on Le Moyne's 1965–66 conference slate was a February loss at Saint Peter's. However, the Peacocks went 5–0 in MECAA play to take the league title.\nThe 1966 NCAA tournament included 36 schools, four more than the previous season. Seven of the eight regions had four teams as had previously been the norm. The Northeast Region had eight teams divided into two divisions. Le Moyne was selected to host the four games in Division B of the Northeast Region. However, as of the time Le Moyne was chosen as a host, the Dolphins had not yet been extended a bid to play in the tournament. Le Moyne agreed to host regardless of whether it was participating. After impressive wins over King's and Saint Michael's, Le Moyne, with a record of 12–4, accepted an invitation to the NCAA tournament.\nLe Moyne lost their first-round game to Philadelphia Textile, 83–61. Gary DeYulia led the Dolphins with 26 points.\nLe Moyne salvaged their consolation game against Potsdam State, 86–63. Paul Zajac of Philadelphia Textile was named most valuable player of the Northeast Region Division B. Gary DeYulia had 25 points in the consolation game, giving him 51 for the two tournament games, and was named a Northeast Region Division B All-Star.\nAfter the tournament, the Dolphins closed the regular-season with an 88–72 home victory over Siena to finish 16–6. Gary DeYulia had a game-high 23 points in his final collegiate game.\nRebuilding and returning to the NCAA tournament (1966–1968).\nBy 1966, Le Moyne's athletic scholarship budget was $2,500 per annum. Of this total, $2,000 was allotted for four basketball players and did not need to be allocated among those students in equal amounts. The remaining $500 was awarded to a cross-county athlete. Factors taken into account in awarding a scholarship were athletic aptitude, general attitude and financial need. Once a scholarship was awarded, it remained in effect as long as the student continued attending Le Moyne, even if the student decided not to participate in athletics. Coach Niland reported that Le Moyne typically received between 60 and 70 requests for athletic scholarships each year. As of the fall 1965 semester, tuition at Le Moyne was $1,200 per academic year. In late 1966, the ECAC amended its rules, allowing scholarships based solely on athletic ability. Previously, ECAC member schools were permitted to grant athletic scholarships only based on financial need and academic achievement.\nThe Dolphins returned only one starter, Eric Pitman, for the 1966–67 season with Gary DeYulia, Tom Mullen, Gerry Glose and Jon Cook all having graduated. Dave Carey was the only player other than Pitman who was part of the previous season's rotation. Only six of the 14 players on the team had previously played varsity basketball. Earl Eichelberger joined the team as a transfer from Bronx Community College. The outlook for a fourth straight NCAA tournament appearance was not promising. Pitman was elected captain by his teammates.\nIn a meeting with the local press less than two weeks before the 1966–67 season opener, Coach Niland expressed concern that the Dolphins would have trouble scoring but praised the ball-handling ability of freshman Tom Downey, saying Downey would start for the varsity team if he were eligible.\nLe Moyne reached an agreement to have all Dolphins games, home and away, broadcast on WFBL with Jerry Sanders handling the play-by-play and Ted Downes and Cornelius O'Leary providing color commentary. This was the first season all Dolphins games were broadcast on radio.\nIn late 1966, Margaret Dwyer, Le Moyne's dean of women, gave permission to female students to begin wearing slacks rather than a skirt or a dress while attending Dolphins basketball games.\nA standing room only crowd of more than 2,200 spectators saw the Dolphins open their season with a 72–56 victory over Cortland State on December 3. It was the first time a Le Moyne home opener was a sellout. Dave Cary led the Dolphins with 19 points, and Eric Pitman added 17. Tom Devins and Jerry Ballone each had 14 points and nine rebounds. Le Moyne held the Red Dragons to 34% shooting while hitting 43% of their own shots.\nAfter suffering road losses at King's and Scranton, the Dolphins faced Maine in the third annual Le Moyne Christmas invitational tournament on December 28. Despite a 34-point effort from Terry Carr, the Dolphins broke open a close game over the final 11 minutes, as four Maine players fouled out. Gerry McDermott led Le Moyne with 23 points and pulled down seven rebounds as the Dolphins evened their record at 2–2 with an 85–74 victory.\nThe following night, Bob La Russo scored 24 points, and Bob McMahon added 14 for Iona in a 59–45 win for the Gaels, the first visiting team to win the tournament. Kurt Dorif and Tom Burke gave Iona a dominant rebounding edge, which the Dolphins could not overcome. Gerry McDermott was Le Moyne's only player in double figures with 12 points and was named to the All-Tournament team.\nAfter a home loss to Saint Peter's dropped the Dolphins' record to 2–4, Le Moyne won three straight on the road, the last two of which came via dramatic last-second shots. Eric Pitman's offensive rebound and buzzer-beating 12-foot jump shot gave the Dolphins a 58–56 win at Cortland State on January 11, and Gerry McDermott's driving basket with seven seconds to play was the decider in Le Moyne's 65–63 victory at Siena three nights later. After the team went on a two-week exam break, the Dolphins lost their next game at Iona, 65–45. However, the loss paled in comparison to the news the team received. Starters Dave Cary and Jim Mariotte, both juniors, and reserves junior Greg Bonk and sophomore Gary Luke were all ruled academically ineligible starting in February and through the end of the season.\nThe Dolphins won their final game before the academic suspensions went into effect, 84–62, at Marist to improve to 6–5. Coach Tom Niland said he expected the academic suspensions would result in starting roles for Matt Fallis and Earl Eichelberger and more playing time for Tom Devins and Chuck Brady. The undermanned Dolphins hosted Assumption, who came into the game 11–1, with their only loss coming at the hands of nationally ranked Providence of the University Division, and on a 10-game winning streak, on February 4. Behind 24 points from Gerry McDermott and 18 points and some outstanding rebounding and defensive work from Jerry Ballone, Le Moyne scored a 79–64 upset victory over the Greyhounds.\nThe Dolphins won their next two games, both at home, over St. Lawrence and St. Francis (NY). Mike Kawa replaced leading scorer Gerry McDermott, who was being evaluated by doctors for mononucleosis, in the starting lineup for the St. Francis game and scored 19 points. Doctors cleared McDermott to play in the next game against Hartwick, and he scored 14 points in a 74–69 home loss. Kawa started and had 16 points. The loss to Hartwick was the start of a three-game losing streak, and the Dolphins dropped five of their final seven games of the season to finish 11–10. Captain Eric Pitman was presented the first annual Cy Reynolds Memorial Trophy as the season's most outstanding Le Moyne player selected by members of the media.\nIn the spring of 1967, a change in ECAC rules allowed freshmen to compete on varsity teams at schools with fewer than 1,000 male students. Since Le Moyne had less than 900 male students at the time, the Dolphins were covered by the new rule. Coach Tom Niland stated that he expected Le Moyne to continue fielding a freshman team to allow players new to college basketball to gain experience, but freshmen judged ready to compete would be permitted to play on the varsity squad.\nCoach Tom Niland said he expected to employ a more up-tempo offense in 1967–68 than he had in the previous season. Senior Gerry McDermott was elected captain by his teammates. Eric Pitman and Gerry Ballone were lost to graduation. The Dolphins had seven returning players and five sophomores on the roster. McDermott, Tom Devins and Earl Eichelberger were the three seniors on the team. Junior Gary Luke returned from academic ineligibility. Sophomore Tom Downey and junior Mike Kawa were expected to compete for a starting guard role. No freshmen were selected to play on the varsity squad.\nPrior to the opening of training camp, the players went through a new exercise program designed by Niland and Le Moyne's new cross country coach and physical education instructor Dick Rockwell that included weightlifting with the goal of adding two inches to each player's leaping ability.\nOn November 2, the Dolphins had a home scrimmage against Niagara featuring their star player, future Naismith Hall of Famer Calvin Murphy. The Purple Eagles were in town as co-presenters alongside the Dolphins, the Syracuse Orange and former Syracuse Nationals player and then Detroit Pistons assistant coach Paul Seymour at Le Moyne's annual basketball clinic for coaches.\nThe Dolphins opened their 1967–68 season with an 88–76 victory at St. Lawrence on December 2. Senior captain Gerry McDermott led the way with 28 points. Sophomores John Zych and Tom Downey, who were high school teammates at St. John the Evangelist had fine showings in their first varsity game. Downey started and scored seven points and displayed impressive ball handling and playmaking skills. Zych came off the bench and used his excellent shooting and driving skills to score 20 points. Junior Matt \"Butch\" Fallis had 11 points and 11 rebounds. Earl Eichelberger contributed 12 points. Coach Tom Niland said that the starting lineup would vary from game to game this season and be based on the opponent. The lineup of McDermott, Downey, Fallis, Eichelberger and Chuck Brady was chosen to maximize te Dolphins' rebounding ability and slow down the high-octane offense of St Lawrence.\nCold shooting doomed Le Moyne in their home opener, as they fell to Iona, 58–57, in a game they trailed all night but made close in the final minute. Mike Kawa led the Dolphins with 16 points. However, following the loss, the Dolphins embarked on a five-game winning streak, capped by a 78–74 overtime victory over Bucknell in the final of the Le Moyne Christmas invitational on December 29. Tom Downey and Tom Devins scored baskets for the first four points of overtime to give the Dolphins a 69–65 lead, and the Bison were unable to pull even the rest of the way. Downey hit a pair of free throws in the closing seconds put the game away. Gerry McDermott scored 19 points for Le Moyne and was voted the tournament's most valuable player. Chuck Brady led the Dolphins with 9 rebounds and had 18 points, including a pivotal three-point play on a putback of an offensive rebound in overtime that gave Le Moyne a 74–68 lead. The previous night, the Dolphins defeated Vermont, 95–72, behind Brady's 20 points and nine rebounds.\nAfter an 80–77 loss at Assumption on February 10, dropped the Dolphins' record to 8–6, it appeared a foregone conclusion that Le Moyne would not be invited to the NCAA tournament.\nAfter a third straight win improved the Dolphins record to 11–6, talk of an NCAA tournament bid was revived. Gerry McDermott scored 22 points in the 79–70 home win over Ithaca, considered a contender for a tournament bid, on February 20. Chuck Brady added 10 points and 13 rebounds. John Zych and Tom Downey scored 21 and 17 points, respectively. Four days later, another victory, this time over St. Michael's, who were also widely regarded a contender for a tournament berth, convinced Dolphin's followers that a trip to the NCAA tournament was imminent. \nThe wins over two highly touted teams led to a revelation from a selection committee member that the Dolphins were \"very much in the running for a berth.\" Tom Downey had 15 points and 10 rebounds in the 83–73 win over St. Michael's. Mike Kawa had 10 points off the bench having been pressed into duty, after Gerry McDermott turned his left ankle.\nAt 4 p.m. on February 28, the selection committee announced that Le Moyne had been invited to the 1968 NCAA tournament and would open against Buffalo State in Rochester, New York on March 5. The other game in Rochester pitted the host, Rochester, against Northeastern. The two winners would meet in the regional semifinals on March 6.\nLe Moyne had a game scheduled at Alfred on March 5. This game was moved to March 9, if the Dolphins did not advance to the regional final. If Le Moyne won two games in Rochester, the Alfred game would be cancelled.\nIn a final tune-up before the NCAA tournament, the Dolphins posted an 82–70 home win over Siena on March 2. Mike Kawa filled in admirably for Dolphins' captain and leading scorer, Gerry McDermott, who was out with a pulled tendon in his left leg. Matt Fallis led Le Moyne with 22 points and 13 rebounds. The win improved the Dolphins' record to 13–6 with four of their losses coming at the hands of University Division opponents. At halftime, McDermott was presented the Sy Reynolds Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player of the team selected by members of the media. McDermott's status for the NCAA tournament was doubtful.\nAbout 500 Dolphins fans made the journey to Rochester, but Le Moyne's senior captain and leading scorer, Gerry McDermott, could only play limited minutes due to injury, and Buffalo State used their size advantage to control the boards on their way to an 83–66 victory. Charles Davis led the Orangemen with 20 points and 27 rebounds. Le Moyne struggled throughout the game to get good looks at the basket against taller defenders. Tom Downey managed to score 13 points. John Zych was the only other Dolphin to reach double figures with 10 points. McDermott finished with eight points.\nNortheastern hit 23 of 34 free-throw attempts compared with only 6 for 11 from the line for the Dolphins, and the Huskies won the consolation game of the Northeast Region's Section B, 67–54. Each team had 44 rebounds, and Le Moyne had 24 field goals, while Northeastern had only 22. However, the Dolphins were unable to defend the larger Huskies without fouling. Dave Cary came off the bench to score a season-high 21 points for Le Moyne. Earl Eichelberger had 10 rebounds. Tom Downey was held to four points. Gerry McDermott exacerbated his left heel injury in the Buffalo State game and did not play.\nThe Dolphins closed their season with an 83–80 win at Alfred on March 9, to finish 14–8.\nCoach Niland's final years.\nThe Dolphins won their sixth MECAA championship in 1968–69 with a 4–1 conference record and were 15–8 over all, but they were not selected to play in the postseason.\nIn 1972–73, Tommy Niland's 25th and final season as head coach, Le Moyne went 5–0 in MECAA play to win their seventh conference championship. Niland closed his coaching career with a 65–61 loss at archrival Siena on March 3, 1973. The Dolphins were 13–9 in his final season, and his 326 wins and six NCAA tournament appearances both remain the most ever by a Le Moyne head coach.\nThomas Cooney, Michael Lee and John Beilein.\nLe Moyne remained a member of the MECAA throughout the conference's entire existence, until it was dissolved following the 1975–76 season. The Dolphins took the MECAA title six times during their 21 seasons of membership, the most championships of any member. Since conference membership crossed NCAA divisions, the MECAA champion was not awarded an automatic bid to any NCAA tournament.\nLe Moyne became a Division II institution, when the College Division was split in 1973. Following the dissolution of the MECAA in 1976, the Dolphins played as an independent until joining the Mideast Collegiate Conference (MECC) in 1983, and remained a member of that conference, until it dissolved in 1991. Le Moyne won two MECC regular-season titles and one conference tournament during their eight years in the league.\nAs MECC tournament champions in 1988, Le Moyne returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time in 20 years with a 23–5 regular-season record under the leadership of head coach John Beilein. After suffering a first-round loss to California (PA), the Dolphins rebounded to defeat Kutztown and finish third in the region. The 24 wins were the most in program history up to that point. The 1987–88 Dolphins were inducted into the Le Moyne College Athletic Hall of Fame as a team in 2017.\nScot Hicks era.\nAfter playing the 1991–92 season as an independent, Le Moyne joined the New England Collegiate Conference (NECC) in 1992. Led by head coach Scott Hicks, a Le Moyne alumnus whose playing career spanned 1984 to 1988, the Dolphins won the NECC tournament in 1996, their final season in the league, and that earned them a berth in the NCAA tournament, where they were seeded 5th in the Northeast Region. Although they entered the tournament with a 24–5 record, the Dolphins suffered a 30-point loss in the first round at the hands of Franklin Pierce. The 24 wins matched the highest total in program history, previously achieved in 1987–88.\nIn 1996, the Dolphins joined the Northeast-10 Conference (NE10), where they remained until beginning reclassification to Division I as a member of the NEC in 2023. During their 26 seasons over a span of 27 years in the NE10 (the 2020–21 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Le Moyne won four regular-season conference championships and two conference tournaments.\nDespite a losing record in their first NE10 season, Le Moyne won the conference tournament and advanced to the 1997 NCAA tournament, their second straight appearance. The Dolphins lost in the first round to Saint Rose.\nDave Paulsen era.\nLe Moyne followed up their 1997 NCAA tournament appearance with a 20–8 season in 1997–98, under first-year head coach Dave Paulsen. Their 14–6 conference record was good enough for a share of the NE10 regular-season crown. The Dolphins' season ended with a loss to Assumption in the conference tournament semifinals. Le Moyne had finished in a three-way tie for first place with Assumption and Stonehill, who was upset in the tournament quarterfinals. Assumption won the conference tournament and was the only NE10 team selected to play in the 1998 NCAA tournament.\nSteve Evans era.\nAlthough it was an exhibition game, the Dolphins nevertheless attracted national attention when they defeated Syracuse at the Carrier Dome on November 3, 2009. Syracuse was ranked no. 25 in the preseason AP poll at the time. However, Christopher Johnson's three-pointer with 8.3 seconds remaining gave Division II Le Moyne an 82–79 road victory over a Division I national power. Syracuse had finished the previous season 28–10, ranked no. 13 in Division I, and reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament. Once the season started, the Orange recovered. They were 2009–10 Big East Conference regular-season champions and reached the Sweet 16 of the 2010 NCAA tournament.\nDespite an exit from the 2014 NE10 tournament in the semifinals, Le Moyne received and at-large NCAA tournament bid. As the 6th seed in the East Region, the Dolphins were defeated by Saint Anselm. Le Moyne finished the 2013–14 season 17–12.\nCoach Patrick Beilein leads Dolphins to three straight NCAA tournaments.\nPatrick Beilein, son of John Beilein, who coached the Dolphins from 1983 to 1992, took the head coaching reigns in 2015. After a losing record in his first season, Beilein produced an era of success for Le Moyne basketball with three straight NCAA tournament appearances. Beilein made his debut as the Dolphins' head coach in an exhibition game against Michigan, coached by his father, at the Crisler Center. More than 70 members of the Beilein clan traveled from around the country to attend the game, which Michigan won, 74–52.\nIn 2016–17, the Dolphins won the NE10 Southwest Division title and had the best regular-season record in the entire conference. Despite being upset in the NE10 tournament semifinals, Le Moyne's 22–6 record was good enough to secure an at-large berth as the no. 1 seed in the East Region of the NCAA tournament, hosting the first three rounds. However, the Dolphins suffered a first-round loss to Merrimack, 72–68, in overtime in front of the home crowd. For his efforts, Beilein was named 2017 NE10 coach of the year.\nLe Moyne's 2017–18 season was perhaps the best in program history by all measures. They achieved a new high in wins with 27, won the NE10 Southwest Division title, had the best conference record of any NE10 team, won the conference tournament and secured a no. 1 seed and hosting rights at the NCAA tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight. The Dolphins were an astounding 18–2 in conference play and entered the NE tournament with a 21–6 record and blitzed their way to the title. They defeated Stonehill by 39 points in the quarterfinals and topped Merrimack, 83–55, in the semifinals. The title game was a 69–63 victory over Northeast Division champion Saint Anselm. Le Moyne's Isaiah Eisendorf was named tournament MVP. Coach Beilein collected his second straight NE10 coach of the year award.\nPlaying at home in the NCAA tournament, Le Moyne scored victories over Jefferson, Saint Rose and Bloomfield. The Elite Eight was held in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where the Dolphins fell to West Texas A&amp;M, 87–73. Entering the NCAA tournament, Le Moyne was ranked no. 24 nationally in the season's final Division II coaches poll.\nLe Moyne won another NE10 Southwest Division title in 2018–19. The Dolphins were upset at home in the conference tournament semifinals by Merrimack, 84–77, in overtime. Nevertheless, Le Moyne's 18–10 record earned them the no. 3 seed in the East Region at the NCAA tournament. The Dolphins were matched up in the first round with St. Thomas Aquinas, coached by former Le Moyne assistant coach, Tobin Anderson. After the Dolphins built a 19-point lead, the Spartans staged a furious comeback to earn a 61–59 victory and eliminate Le Moyne from the tournament. After the season, Beirlein left Le Moyne to become the head coach at Division I Niagara.\nNate Champion era.\nNate Champion, a Le Moyne alumnus, was hired as the new head coach in 2019. The Dolphins won their fourth straight NE10 Southwest Division title and had the best NE10 regular-season conference record in Champion's first season. Le Moyne bowed out at home in the NE10 tournament quarterfinals to New Haven, 75–73. Champion was named NE10 coach of the year, the third straight season the award has been won by a Le Moyne coach. The 2020 NCAA tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nReclassification to Division I.\nIn April 2022, Le Moyne College president Linda LeMura revealed that the school had hired a consultant to assess the feasibility of reclassifying to Division I and had begun internal discussions regarding the potential impact. In September 2022, a social media post of a sports journalist indicated that the decision to move to Division I had been made, but no official announcement would come from Le Moyne, until it had officially been invited to join a conference.\nOn May 10, 2023, Le Moyne announced that the Dolphins would begin a transition to Division I, joining the Northeast Conference (NEC). The Dolphins officially became a Division I program and a member of the NEC on July 1.\nAs a team transitioning from Division II, Le Moyne will not be eligible to participate in the NCAA Division I tournament until 2028, since there is a required four-year transition period. However, effective for the 2023–24 academic year, NEC teams transitioning from Division II are eligible for the NEC tournament during the entirety of their transition periods. Prior to the conference's rule change, NEC teams were eligible for the conference tournament only during their third and fourth transition years. As a result, Le Moyne became eligible for the 2024 NEC tournament. The top eight finishers in the nine-team NEC participate in the conference tournament.\nDarrick Jones Jr. hit a three-pointer from the top of the key early in the Dolphins' season opener at Georgetown for Le Moyne's first points scored as a Division I program on November 7, 2023. Ball State transfer Kaiyem Cleary led the Dolphins with 11 points, all in the second half, and seven rebounds. Georgetown used a 9–2 run to take a 12–5 lead early in the game. The Hoyas extended the lead with an 8–0 run that made the score 20–7. After a brief flurry led by Jones, Trent Mosquera and Mike DePersia got the Dolphins within single digits at 28–19, the Hoyas closed the first half with a 19–4 run that gave them a 47–23 halftime lead on their way to a 94–57 victory. Jones and Luke Sutherland each contributed nine points for Le Moyne in the losing cause.\nLe Moyne used first-half runs of 16–2 and 20–2 to build a 47–15 lead and never looked back on their way to a 105–46 victory, their first as a Division I program, over Division III SUNY Canton in their 2023–24 home opener on November 13, 2023. Five Dolphins had double-figure scoring games led by Kaiyem Cleary with 21 points, Nate McClure with 16, Darrick Jones Jr. with 13 and freshman AJ Dancler with 12. Redshirt freshman Nate Fouts made his collegiate debut and scored 11 points with three assists and two blocked shots. Cleary shot 8 for 10 from the field, while adding seven rebounds and two steals in just 16 minutes. McClure hit six of his seven shots, including 4-for-5 shooting from three-point range. Dancler grabbed five rebounds and dished out five assists. The Dolphins shot 32 for 37 on two-point field goals for the game, including 15 for 16 in the first half.\nLe Moyne recorded its first victory over a Division I opponent as a Division I program, an 80–70 win at Cal State Northridge on November 21, 2023, in their opening game of the Golden State Hoops Jam, a multi-team event sponsored by Pacific. Luke Sutherland led the Dolphins with 24 points and five rebounds. Le Moyne started five graduate students for the first time in the program's history, and they responded by sprinting to an 11–4 lead to start the game, getting early scoring from Sutherland, Nate McClure (12 points, four rebounds and three steals for the game) and Isaiah Salter. After Le Moyne fell behind, 15–12, Mike DePersia (eight points, nine assists, four rebounds and three steals for the game) sparked a 19–2 run with a pull-up jump shot. The Matadors could not get closer than three points behind the rest of the way. The Dolphins closed out the game with strong free-throw shooting, finishing the game 31-for-34 from the charity stripe.\nKaiyem Cleary scored 43 points on January 27, 2024, to break Le Moyne's single-game individual scoring record, first set on January 7, 1955, and the Dolphins cruised to an 87–74 victory over LIU. Cleary's 43 points were the most scored by a player in regulation and the third most scored by a player in a single game up to that point in the Division I season. Cleary was 14 for 25 from the floor, including 6 for 10 from beyond the arc, and shot 9 for 9 from the free-throw line. He also led Le Moyne in rebounds with seven and had a pair of blocked shots. Despite shooting 0 for 6 from three-point range, Luke Sutherland scored 16 points and added five rebounds for the Dolphins. With Le Moyne trailing, 46–45, early in the second half, Cleary scored 13 points over six and a half minutes to spark a decisive 20–4 run that put the Dolphins ahead, 65–50.\nKaiyem Cleary scored with 45 seconds left in regulation to tie up Le Moyne's home game with Central Connecticut on February 15. After the Blue Devils took a one-point lead in overtime, the Dolphins scored the final six points of the extra session, including a baseline jump shot by Cleary with 1:24 to play that gave Le Moyne the lead for good. Cleary finished with 21 points, 11 rebounds, two assists and two blocked shots. Freshman AJ Dancler had 13 points, four of them in overtime, three assists, two rebounds and two steals in 26 minutes off the bench for the Dolphins. With the win, Le Moyne clinched a berth in the NEC tournament.\nThe Dolphins recognized former players to celebrate their 75th season and earned a 75–67 victory over Stonehill on February 17. Luke Sutherland led the way for Le Moyne with 23 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Kaiyem Cleary had 14 points and seven rebounds. The Dolphins led the game by 12 points at halftime and were in front, 58–45, when the Skyhawks went on a 13–0 run to tie the game at 58. Once the game was tied, neither team scored for nearly three minutes, until Cleary broke Le Moyne's 7:51 scoring drought with a drive to the basket and then converted the free throw to complete a three-point play. Sutherland followed with a basket from the lane to give the Dolphins a five-point lead. Leading 65–62, Le Moyne got five points form Nate McClure to key a 7–0 run and extend their lead to 10 points with 1:02 to play.\nEntering the final day of the regular season, Le Moyne had the opportunity to earn the no. 4 seed in the NEC tournament and home-court advantage in the NEC quarterfinals with a win. If the Dolphins were to lose, the no. 4 seed would go to the winner of the regular-season finale between Fairleigh Dickinson and Wagner scheduled for the same day.\nLe Moyne claimed the no. 4 seed in the NEC tournament and home-court advantage in the NEC quarterfinals with a 74–58 win at Saint Francis on March 2. Luke Sutherland led the Dolphins with 22 points, shooting 8 for 10 from the field and 3 for 4 from beyond the arc, seven rebounds, a career-high eight assists, two blocked shots and one steal. After the Red Flash took a 3–0 lead, Le Moyne went on a 10–0 run, keyed by five points from Nate McClure, and led the rest of the way. After a Saint Francis run cut the Dolphins lead to 25–24, the Dolphins answered with an 11–4 run, getting five of their points from Darrick Jones Jr., to reassert control. A late flurry by the Red Flash cut the Le Moyne lead to 39–34 at the break. The Dolphins scored the first nine points of the second half to build a 14-point lead. However, Le Moyne had a 5:10 scoring drought during which Saint Francis had only four points but cut the lead to nine with 8:47 remaining. Saint Francis continued to creep closer and found themselves trailing 60–52 with 6:33 to play. The Dolphins extinguished any hopes for a comeback with a 14–0 run over a span of 3:42 and led by 22 points with 2:34 on the clock.\nKaiyem Cleary was named first-team All-NEC. Luke Sutherland was named to the All-Conference second team.\nPowered by Luke Sutherland's 22 points, Le Moyne cruised to an 82–61 wire-to-wire victory over Fairleigh Dickinson in the program's Division I postseason debut on March 6. The Dolphins opened the game with three three-pointers to take a 9–0 lead just 1:45 into the contest. The Knights settled down, and Le Moyne was up, 42–34, at intermission. Leading 46–40 in the second half, the Dolphins went on an 11–0 run over 2:09 to take a 57–40 lead with 15:42 remaining. Fairleigh Dickinson got no closer than 12 points behind the rest of the way. Darrick Jones Jr. scored 17 points for Le Moyne.\nAfter Le Moyne jumped out to an early 13–4 lead in the NEC semifinals on March 9, Merrimack's defense got the Warriors back into the game, and a 19–3 run in the later part of the first half helped them build a 28–20 lead at intermission. The Dolphins cut the deficit to three with 14:47 to play on a put-back by Kaiyem Cleary. The teams traded three-pointers over the next three minutes, until Samba Diallo's layups on consecutive possessions extended Merrimack's lead to seven points. The Dolphins responded with a 6–2 run to get within three points at 40–37 with 8:14 to play. An 8–2 Warriors run gave them a nine-point lead with 6:45 on the clock, but Le Moyne responded with a pair of three-pointers by Luke Sutherland to pull within three again with 5:42 to play. After each team had two empty possessions over the next two minutes, Bryan Etumnu was fouled on a layup and completed the three-point play, sparking a 9–2 Merrimack run that put the game away. The Warriors' 61–51 victory ended the Dolphins' inaugural Division I season. Sutherland had 23 points and eight rebounds for Le Moyne, and he was named to the NEC All-Tournament Team.\nCoaches.\nThere have been nine head coaches in the history of Le Moyne men's basketball. The program has played 1,918 games across 75 seasons from the program's inaugural 1948–49 campaign through the end of the 2023–24 season.\nTommy Niland had the longest tenure at Le Moyne, coaching for 25 seasons, and is the all-time leader in games coached (537) and wins at the school (326).\nThe current head coach is Nate Champion, who played for the Dolphins from 2010 to 2014.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA Division II.\nDuring their time in NCAA Division II, the Dolphins were selected to play in the NCAA Division II men's basketball tournament thirteen times. They had a combined record of 7–16.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the Division II tournament with the 1989 edition.\"\nBetween 1958 and 1988, the NCAA chose eight or nine schools as hosts for the College Division/Division II regionals. These teams played their regional semifinal games and (if they won) their regional final (Sweet 16) games at home during years the tournament included 32 teams. In some years, there were 36 teams with seven regions having four teams and one region having eight teams. In eight-team regions, the host school might have played as many as three tournament games at home, if it was designated as being in the division given home-court advantage for the regional final. A host school effectively had the privileges of what would later be identified as a no. 1 seed. However, factors such as availability and quality of facilities, expected fan support and travel arrangements entered into the choice of a host school. In addition, teams played in regions that reflected the locations of the schools. Therefore, if the two best teams in the College Division or Division II were near each other, it is likely only one of them would be selected to host. Thus, the hosts were not necessarily the top eight teams. Nevertheless, Le Moyne was one of the eight host schools for the 1965 NCAA tournament.\nThe 1966 NCAA tournament included 36 schools, four more than the previous season. Seven of the eight regions had four teams as had previously been the norm. The Northeast Region had eight teams divided into two divisions. Le Moyne was selected to host the four games in Division B of the Northeast Region. However, as of the time Le Moyne was chosen as a host, the Dolphins had not yet been extended a bid to play in the tournament. Le Moyne agreed to host regardless of whether it was participating. The Division A winner had the right to host the regional final, which means Le Moyne, which ultimately did receive a tournament bid, would have played on the road had they advanced that far. This effectively conferred upon Le Moyne the rights and privileges of a no. 2 seed within the region. However, since Le Moyne was in an eight-team region, it would have needed to win one more game than all 28 teams in four-team regions to reach the national quarterfinals, which makes the extra game similar to a play-in game such as the First Four in the Division I tournament.\nRivalry with Siena.\nBefore the Dolphins had ever played a varsity basketball game, Siena was identified as Le Moyne's chief rival. \"BEAT SIENA!\" was the front-page headline of the school newspaper on November 24, 1948, 13 days before the Dolphins' inaugural varsity game, scheduled to be played at home against Siena. A pep rally was held the night before the game and attended by the team, the head coach, the athletic director and, of course, the cheerleaders. Those organizing the rally had someone dressed as an Indian, Siena's team nickname at the time, appear to be tossed into the bonfire and burned. The rivalry was acknowledged by Siena shortly after the teams began playing, perhaps, in part, because the teams met in the 1951 National Catholic Invitational Tournament (NCIT).\nSiena won the first-ever matchup, 41–39, on December 7, 1948, and went on to take the first five games between the teams, the fourth and fifth of which went to overtime, before Le Moyne broke through with a win at home followed by a win in the NCIT, which was played on Siena's home court. After 21 seasons as Siena's head basketball coach, Dan Cunha resigned in July 1965. Four months later, Cunha was hired as Le Moyne's new dean of men, a position with no athletic duties. In 1976, Siena reclassified to Division I, while Le Moyne remained a Division II program. The annual scheduling of games between the teams ceased, and they did not meet again for 11 years. The teams played one game annually between the 1987–88 and 1992–93 seasons, and Siena won all six of those contests. Le Moyne's 2023 reclassification to Division I creates the possibility that this rivalry may be rekindled. It has been years since the teams last met in an official game. The Dolphins defeated Siena, 73–71, in an exhibition game in November 2017, at Loudonville.\nChristmas invitational tournament.\nIn 1964, Le Moyne began hosting an annual four-team Christmas invitational tournament. The brackets below show the results of these tournament games.\n1964.\n\"References:\" \nGary DeYulia of Le Moyne was named most valuable player.\n1965.\n\"References:\" \nDan Parham of Hartwick was named most valuable player.\n1966.\n\"References:\" \nBob La Russo of Iona was named most valuable player.\nThe All-Tournament team selected by members of the media covering the tournament included:\n1967.\n\"References:\" \nGerry McDermott of Le Moyne was named most valuable player.\nThe All-Tournament team selected by members of the media covering the tournament included:\n1968.\n\"References:\" \nRay Hodge of Wagner was named most valuable player.\nThe tournament All-Star team selected by members of the media covering the tournament included:\nWins against higher-division opponents.\nStarting with Le Moyne's inaugural 1948–49 season through the end of the 1955–56 season, the final season before the NCAA split into the University Division and the College Division, the Dolphins were classified by the Associated Press (AP) as a small-college (non-major) program. During that time, Le Moyne played 56 games against major programs, as classified by the AP. The results of such games are shown in the table below.\nOn several occasions, the Dolphins, playing as a College Division or Division II team, recorded victories over University Division or Division I teams. Le Moyne played 57 such games, going 29–28, and won at least one in each of their first 13 seasons as a College Division program, beginning with the NCAA's split into divisions for the 1956–57 season through the end of the 1968–69 season. Details of these games are shown in the table below.\nHonorees.\nLe Moyne has 37 men's basketball players, coaches and contributors honored in the Le Moyne Athletic Hall of Fame. In addition, two of Le Moyne's teams have been inducted into the Hall of Fame.\nFacilities.\nLe Moyne Events Center (1962–present).\nThe Le Moyne Dolphins presently play their home games on Ted Grant Court in the 2,637-seat Le Moyne Events Center; the maximum seating capacity for basketball is likely somewhat different from the arena's reported maximum capacity, since that includes seats placed on the floor, but it includes portable bleachers at only one end of the building rather than at both the east and west ends, which is possible for basketball games.\nGround was broken on construction of the Events Center in March 1961, as part of the larger Henninger Athletic Center, and the arena opened on December 1, 1962, with a basketball game featuring Le Moyne vs. archrival Siena. The arena underwent a significant renovation in 2016, and reopened on October 12 of that year.\nThe Events Center hosted Northeast Regional games of the 1965 and 1966 NCAA College Division tournaments."

Jacques Kallis is the highest rated South African with 58 fifties to his name.\nMost centuries.\nA century is a score of 100 or more runs in a single innings.\nTendulkar has also scored the most centuries in Test cricket with 51. South Africa's Jacques Kallis is next on 45 and Ricky Ponting with 41 hundreds is in third.\nMost double centuries.\nA double century is a score of 200 or more runs in a single innings.\nBradman holds the Test record for the most double centuries scored with twelve, one ahead of Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara who finished his career with eleven. In third is Brian Lara of the West Indies with nine. England's Wally Hammond and Mahela Jayawardene of Sri Lanka both scored seven double centuries. Graeme Smith has scored the most double centuries for South Africa, with 5.\nMost triple centuries.\nA triple century is a score of 300 or more runs in a single innings.\nHashim Amla is the only South African to have scored a triple century for South Africa.\nMost runs in a series.\nThe 1930 Ashes series in England saw Don Bradman set the record for the most runs scored in a single series, falling just 26 short of 1,000 runs. He is followed by Wally Hammond with 905 runs scored in the 1928–29 Ashes series. Aubrey Faulkner with 732 in the 1910 tour of Australia is the highest South African on the list.\nMost ducks.\nA duck refers to a batsman being dismissed without scoring a run. Morne Morkel has scored the equal sixteen-highest number of ducks in Test cricket. Glenn McGrath has scored the equal third-highest number of ducks in Test cricket behind Courtney Walsh with 43 and Chris Martin with 36.\nBowling records.\nMost career wickets.\nA bowler takes the wicket of a batsman when the form of dismissal is bowled, caught, leg before wicket, stumped or hit wicket. If the batsman is dismissed by run out, obstructing the field, handling the ball, hitting the ball twice or timed out the bowler does not receive credit.\nSouth Africa's Dale Steyn is eight on the list, having taken 439 wickets. \nBest figures in an innings.\nBowling figures refers to the number of the wickets a bowler has taken and the number of runs conceded.\nThere have been two occasions in Test cricket where a bowler has taken all ten wickets in a single innings – Jim Laker of England took 10/53 against Australia in 1956 and India's Anil Kumble in 1999 returned figures of 10/74 against Pakistan. Hugh Tayfield and Keshav Maharaj are one of 15 bowlers who have taken nine wickets in a Test match innings.\nBest figures in a match.\nA bowler's bowling figures in a match is the sum of the wickets taken and the runs conceded over both innings.\nNo bowler in the history of Test cricket has taken all 20 wickets in a match. The closest to do so was English spin bowler Jim Laker. During the fourth Test of the 1956 Ashes series, Laker took 9/37 in the first innings and 10/53 in the second to finish with match figures of 19/90. Makhaya Ntini, with figures of 13/132, taken during the second match of the South Africa tour of West Indies in 2005, is the best in Test cricket for South Africa.\nBest career average.\nA bowler's bowling average is the total number of runs they have conceded divided by the number of wickets they have taken.\nNineteenth century English medium pacer George Lohmann holds the record for the best career average in Test cricket with 10.75. J. J. Ferris, one of fifteen cricketers to have played Test cricket for more than one team, is second behind Lohmann with an overall career average of 12.70 runs per wicket.\nBest career economy rate.\nA bowler's economy rate is the total number of runs they have conceded divided by the number of overs they have bowled.\nEnglish bowler William Attewell, who played 10 matches for England between 1884 and 1892, holds the Test record for the best career economy rate with 1.31. South Africa's Trevor Goddard, with a rate of 1.64 runs per over conceded over his 41-match Test career, is third on the list.\nBest career strike rate.\nA bowler's strike rate is the total number of balls they have bowled divided by the number of wickets they have taken.\nAs with the career average above, the top bowler with the best Test career strike rate is George Lohmann with strike rate of 34.1 balls per wicket. South Africa's Kagiso Rabada is at fourth position in this list.\nMost five-wicket hauls in an innings.\nA five-wicket haul refers to a bowler taking five wickets in a single innings.\nDale Steyn is tenth on the list of most five-wicket hauls in Test cricket.\nMost ten-wicket hauls in a match.\nA ten-wicket haul refers to a bowler taking ten or more wickets in a match over two innings.\nAs with the five-wicket hauls above, Anil Kumble is not only behind Muralitharan, Warne and Hadlee, he is also behind Rangana Herath of Sri Lanka in taking the most ten-wicket hauls in Test cricket.\nWorst figures in an innings.\nThe worst figures in a single innings in Test cricket came in the third Test between the West Indies at home to Pakistan in 1958. Pakistan's Khan Mohammad returned figures of 0/259 from his 54 overs in the second innings of the match. The worst figures by a South African is 0/221 that came off the bowling of Nicky Boje in the first test of the South Africa's tour of Sri Lanka in 2006.\nWorst figures in a match.\nThe worst figures in a match in Test cricket were taken by South Africa's Imran Tahir in the second Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in November 2012. He returned figures of 0/180 from his 23 overs in the first innings and 0/80 off 14 in the third innings for a total of 0/260 from 37 overs. He claimed the record in his final over when two runs came from it – enough for him to pass the previous record of 0/259, set 54 years prior.\nMost wickets in a series.\nEngland's seventh Test tour of South Africa in 1913–14 saw the record set for the most wickets taken by a bowler in a Test series. English paceman Sydney Barnes played in four of the five matches and achieved a total of 49 wickets to his name. South Africa's Hugh Tayfield is joint 13th with his 37 wickets taken against England during the 1956–57 tour.\nHat-trick.\nIn cricket, a hat-trick occurs when a bowler takes three wickets with consecutive deliveries. The deliveries may be interrupted by an over bowled by another bowler from the other end of the pitch or the other team's innings, but must be three consecutive deliveries by the individual bowler in the same match. Only wickets attributed to the bowler count towards a hat-trick; run outs do not count.\nIn Test cricket history there have been just 44 hat-tricks, the first achieved by Fred Spofforth for Australia against England in 1879. In 1912, Australian Jimmy Matthews achieved the feat twice in one game against South Africa. The only other players to achieve two hat-tricks are Australia's Hugh Trumble, against England in 1902 and 1904, Pakistan's Wasim Akram, in separate games against Sri Lanka in 1999, and England's Stuart Broad.\nWicket-keeping records.\nThe wicket-keeper is a specialist fielder who stands behind the stumps being guarded by the batsman on strike and is the only member of the fielding side allowed to wear gloves and leg pads.\nMost career dismissals.\nA wicket-keeper can be credited with the dismissal of a batsman in two ways, caught or stumped. A fair catch is taken when the ball is caught fully within the field of play without it bouncing after the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat, while a stumping occurs when the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket while the batsman is out of his ground and not attempting a run.\nSouth Africa's Mark Boucher holds the record for most dismissals in Test cricket as a designated wicket-keeper.\nMost career catches.\nBoucher holds the record for most catches in Test cricket as a designated wicket-keeper.\nMost career stumpings.\nBert Oldfield, Australia's fifth-most capped wicket-keeper, holds the record for the most stumpings in Test cricket with 52. Boucher has most stumpings with 23.\nMost dismissals in an innings.\nFour wicket-keepers have taken seven dismissals in a single innings in a Test match—Wasim Bari of Pakistan in 1979, Englishman Bob Taylor in 1980, New Zealand's Ian Smith in 1991 and most recently West Indian gloveman Ridley Jacobs against Australia in 2000.\nThe feat of taking 6 dismissals in an innings has been achieved by 24 wicket-keepers on 32 occasions including 4 South Africans.\nMost dismissals in a match.\nThree wicket-keepers have made 11 dismissals in a Test match, Englishman Jack Russell in 1995, South African AB de Villiers in 2013 and most recently India's Rishabh Pant against Australia in 2018.\nThe feat of making 10 dismissals in a match has been achieved by 4 wicket-keepers on 4 occasions.\nMost dismissals in a series.\nBrad Haddin holds the Test cricket record for the most dismissals taken by a wicket-keeper in a series. He took 29 catches during the 2013 Ashes series. South African record is held by John Waite and Mark Boucher with 26 dismissals.\nFielding records.\nMost career catches.\nCaught is one of the nine methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket. The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen.\nIndia's Rahul Dravid holds the record for the most catches in Test cricket by a non-wicket-keeper with 209, followed by Mahela Jayawardene of Sri Lanka on 205 and South African Jacques Kallis with 196 for South Africa and 4 for ICC.\nMost catches in a series.\nThe 1920–21 Ashes series, in which Australia whitewashed England 5–0 for the first time, saw the record set for the most catches taken by a non-wicket-keeper in a Test series. Australian all-rounder Jack Gregory took 15 catches in the series as well as 23 wickets. South Africa's Bruce Mitchell, Trevor Goddard and Bert Vogler are equal tenth with 12 catches taken during a series.\nAll-round Records.\n1000 runs and 100 wickets.\nA total of 71 players have achieved the double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in their Test career.\n250 runs and 20 wickets in a series.\nA total of 18 players on 24 occasions have achieved the double of 250 runs and 20 wickets in a series.\nOther records.\nMost career matches.\nIndia's Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the most Test matches played with 200, with South Africa's Jacques Kallis being fourth having represented South Africa on 165 occasions.\nMost consecutive career matches.\nFormer English captain Alastair Cook holds the record for the most consecutive Test matches played with 159. He broke Allan Border's long standing record of 153 matches in June 2018. AB de Villiers, the South African played 98 consecutive Test matches, is sixth.\nMost matches as captain.\nGraeme Smith, who led the South African cricket team from 2003 to 2014, holds the record for the most matches played as captain in Test cricket with 109.\nYoungest players.\nThe youngest player to play in a Test match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 227 days. Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 24 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time. The youngest cricketer to play Test cricket for South Africa was Paul Adams who at the age of 18 years and 340 days debuted in the fourth Test of the series against England in December 1995 at St George's Park.\nOldest players on Debut.\nEngland left-arm slow bowler James Southerton is the oldest player to appear in a Test match. Playing in the very first inaugural test against Australia in 1876 at Melbourne Cricket Ground, in Melbourne, Australia, he was aged 49 years and 119 days. Omar Henry is the oldest South African Test debutant in the 1992–93 series against India at Kingsmead Cricket Ground.\nOldest players.\nEngland all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes is the oldest player to appear in a Test match. Playing in the fourth Test against the West Indies in 1930 at Sabina Park, in Kingston, Jamaica, he was aged 52 years and 165 days on the final day's play. The oldest South African Test player is Dave Nourse who was aged 45 years and 204 days when he represented South Africa for the final time in the 1924 tour of England at The Oval.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest Test partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the Sri Lankan pairing of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene who put together a third wicket partnership of 624 runs during the first Test against South Africa in July 2006. This broke the record of 576 runs set by their compatriots Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanama against India in 1997. South Africa's Jacques Rudolph and Boeta Dippenaar hold the 10th highest Test partnership with 429 made in 2003 against Bangladesh.\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nAleem Dar of Pakistan holds the record for the most Test matches umpired with 130. The current active Dar set the record in December 2019 overtaking Steve Bucknor from the West Indies mark of 128 matches. They are followed by South Africa's Rudi Koertzen who officiated in 108."

In the first round, twelve teams played a single playoff round. The six winners and two further teams played the second round, in two tournaments of four teams. Another two teams entered the qualification in the third round in playoff games against the two tournament winners of the second round. Four teams were already qualified for the European Championship 2018. Altogether an all-time record number of twenty teams competed to win the European title in 2018. One team, Germany, did not play a single game due to the national federation of American Football in Germany having an unresolved dispute with IFAF.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played from August to October 2015. Six of the twelve teams took part in one of the tournaments of the last championship. These were the seeded teams playing against an unseeded team. The seeded teams were the hosts of their playoff game. Israel defeating Spain was the only unseeded team to make it to the next round.\nSecond round.\nThe second round tournaments were played in 2016.

        "text": "The Maryland Terrapins women's volleyball team is currently coached by Adam Hughes, who began in 2018.\nYear by year highlights.\n1987–2008.\nMaryland volleyball began in 1983. After a few years, the program was led by future great Janice Kruger. Kruger led the Terps to back-to-back ACC titles in 2004 and 2005, as well as upsets over the following teams: on 10/16/93, #17 Florida State, 9/29/95 #22 Georgia Tech, 10/4/96 #22 Georgia Tech, 8/30/97 #14 Ohio State, 10/21/01 #25 North Carolina, 11/1/03 #4 Georgia Tech, 11/23/03 #6 Georgia Tech. Maryland volleyball head coach Janice Kruger's career accomplishments have reached an apex in recent years: five ACC titles, seven trips to the NCAA Tournament, five ACC and AVCA Region Coach of the Year honors and the top spot among all-time winningest coaches in ACC Volleyball history.\nKruger boasts an impressive .652 overall winning percentage since the 2003 season. After winning the ACC Championship in 2004 with an 18–15 season record, the Terps improved to 28–5 in 2005 to win their third-consecutive ACC Championship and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament for the third straight year. Maryland eased past Kentucky in the first round of the 2005 NCAA's, before dropping a close contest to Louisville.\nThe AVCA named Kruger the East Region Coach of the Year in 2005, marking the fifth time she won the award. In 2003, Kruger was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year after leading Maryland to the ACC Championship. Kruger became the ACC's all-time winningest coach that year and now, heading into the 2007 season, ranks first in conference history with 363 victories at Maryland.\nWith 738 career victories, Kruger has built a powerful program in College Park that includes ACC titles in 1990, 1996, 2003, 2004, 2005 and trips to the NCAA Tournament in 1990, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2004 and 2005. Kruger's success has not gone without notice, as she has been named both the ACC and AVCA District/Region Coach of the Year in 1990, 1996, 1997, 2003 and 2005. During her coaching career, Kruger has amassed a stellar 363–235 record in College Park.\n2008–2013.\nOver his four seasons at Maryland, Tim Horsmon continually recruited top talent to College Park with two players, Mary Cushman (2010) and Adreene Elliott (2011), earning ACC-All Freshman honors. In addition, Horsmon's last four recruiting classes all received Highest Honorable Mention honors from PrepVolleyball.com. In 2010, the Terps narrowly missed out on their first trip to the NCAA tournament in five years. That season the squad finished with 19 victories including two top-25 wins over Duke and Florida State, respectively. Horsmon's tenure at Maryland was marked with continual staff turnover and sub-par performance which ultimately led to his dismissal from the program.\n2014–2017.\nIn his first season with the Terps, Steve Aird led Maryland to a 6–0 start, the program's best since 2005. As he helped guide his team through the Terps’ most difficult schedule, and their first in the Big Ten, Aird also increased support and interest through the community. In 2014, Maryland averaged 1,539 fans per match in College Park, a dramatic increase from the 336 average the season before. In Aird's first season, the Terps set four of the top-10 attendance records in Maryland history, including the No. 1 attendance record (4,522 vs. Penn State, Oct. 23).\nUnder Aird's direction, Maryland earned its first-ever Big Ten win in a nationally televised match over Rutgers on the Big Ten Network. The Terps showed continual improvement throughout the season as the team took set wins over No. 15 Purdue, No. 18 Ohio State and No. 11 Nebraska.\n2018–Present.\nOn January 23, 2018, Adam Hughes was named the fifth head coach of Maryland Volleyball. &lt;http://www.umterps.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=29700&amp;ATCLID=211693993&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;"

        "text": "Liverpool B.C. are a basketball club from the city of Liverpool, England. \nThe Men's first team compete in the English Basketball League Division 3 North West league, and the club have youth teams competing in the U18, U16 and U14 Regional Divisions. They play their home games at the Archbishop Beck Catholic Sports College.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded by Jimmy Rogers and Tim Martyn-Jones as a Junior section to the local YMCA basketball team, playing under the name 'Atac' to reflect the flowing, attacking style of basketball they aimed for the team to play. The team became independent in 1973 and moved to play their home games at the local Riversdale College, changing their name to Riversdale Atac to reflect their new home base. The club then competed in the local Merseyside League and the North West Counties League for many years before turning their eyes towards national level competition.\nIn the late 1980s, the club sought to expand their reach in the community as a precursor to entering the National League, moving their home games to the more suitable Everton Park Sports Centre and renaming themselves Liverpool Atac to attract players from a wider area. As part of their preparations, the club also started to compete in the National Founders Cup, and came up just short of carving their name onto the non-league trophy in 1991 and 1992, finishing as runners-up in both seasons. The club then entered NBL Division 3 for the 1992/1993 season, earning promotion to Division 2 in their first season. Three years later, a third-place finish was enough to secure a place in NBL Division 1 for the 1996/1997 season, but the retirement of a number of senior players meant that their stay in the top English division was brief, lasting only a single season.\nAfter several more years in EBL Division 2, the club moved to the newly constructed Greenbank Sports Academy in the early 2000s, which coincided with a re-organisation of the English league. This saw the club awarded a place in the new NBL Division 1 (now forming the tier below the NBL Conference), but once again the club struggled to maintain their position in the league, finishing bottom in consecutive seasons. The club were reprieved after the 2000/2001 season due to the league's expansion, but they were relegated to NBL Division 2 (North) following their last-place finish in 2001/2002. The club then went the 2002/2003 season unbeaten on their way to a league and playoff double to earn promotion to the second English tier again, just in time for a second league restructure in five years to see the division rebranded as EBL Division 2.\nArguably the club's highest honour to date was to follow in 2005/2006, as they lifted the Patrons Cup following a thrilling 85–83 overtime win over the West Hertfordshire Warriors at the Amaechi Basketball Centre. However, another exodus of experienced players to the newly formed Mersey Tigers saw the club finish bottom in EBL Division 2 in 2006/2007, and then finish bottom again in EBL Division 3 in 2007/2008 to suffer back-to-back relegations and end in the bottom tier of national competition. The club's strong development base enabled them to survive without dropping back to the regional leagues, but they struggled badly for several years, generally finishing in the lower reaches of EBL Division 4 (North).\nA move to the Archbishop Beck Catholic Sports College and a new coach in the 2013/2014 season saw the club's fortunes finally turn for the better, winning promotion with an unbeaten campaign that took in the league and playoff titles. A second success was to follow immediately after, as they won another league and playoff double in their first season back in EBL Division 3, returning to EBL Division 2 for the 2015/2016 season. They struggled in their first season in Division 2, finishing in 7th place, but had a very successful playoff campaign, becoming Division 2 playoff champions in 2016 by defeating Solent Kestrels in the playoff final at the new Basketball Performance Centre in Manchester.\nHonours.\nNBL Division 2 (North) League Champions\nNBL Division 2 Playoff Champions\nPatrons Cup\nEBL Division 4 (North) League Champions\nEBL Division 4 Playoff Champions\nEBL Division 3 (North) League Champions\nEBL Division 3 Playoff Champions\nEBL Division 2 Playoff Champions\nEBL Division 2 League Champions\n2019\nEBL Division 2 Playoff Champions\n2023\nEBL Division 3 North West Conference Champions"

        "text": "The 2017 ICC Champions Trophy was the eighth ICC Champions Trophy, a cricket tournament for the eight top-ranked One Day International (ODI) teams in the world. It was held in England and Wales from 1 to 18 June 2017. Pakistan won the competition for the first time with a 180-run victory over India in the final at The Oval. The margin of victory was the largest by any team in the final of an ICC ODI tournament in terms of runs.\nThe top eight teams in the ICC ODI Championship rankings as on 30 September 2015 qualified for the tournament, and were divided into two groups of four. Bangladesh returned to the ICC Champions Trophy for the first time since 2006, while the West Indies failed to qualify for the first time.\nSecurity around the tournament was increased following the Ariana Grande concert attack in Manchester, just before the start of the competition. The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that they would review security concerns.\nThe ICC Champions Trophy was due to end in 2013, with the 2013 competition the final one, to be replaced by the ICC World Test Championship in 2017. However, in January 2014 it was instead confirmed by the ICC that a Champions Trophy tournament would take place in 2017. In 2016, the ICC confirmed that the Champions Trophy would be scrapped after this tournament, keeping in line with the ICC's goal of having one tournament for each of the three formats of international cricket. In November 2021, the ICC confirmed that the tournament would return in 2025, hosted in Pakistan.\nSummary.\nRain and poor weather affected 5 of the 15 matches played in the tournament. The top two teams in the ICC ODI Rankings at the time (South Africa and Australia) were knocked out in the group stage, with Australia not winning a single game out of their three. 2015 World Cup finalists New Zealand were also knocked out in the group stage, also not winning a single game. Thus, England and Bangladesh from Group A, and India and Pakistan from Group B qualified for the semi-finals. Pakistan beat England comfortably in the first semi-final, winning by 8 wickets with almost 13 overs to spare to make their first final ever in the Champions Trophy. India beat Bangladesh in the second semi-final, also winning comfortably by 9 wickets, in what was Bangladesh's first semi-final in an ICC tournament.\nThe prize money for the 2017 edition of the ICC Champions Trophy was increased by half a million dollars from 2013 to a total of $4.5 million. The winning team got a cheque of $2.2 million and the runner-up got $1.1 million. The other two semifinalists earned $450,000 each. Teams finishing third in each group took home $90,000 each, while the teams finishing last in each group got $60,000 each.\nQualification.\nAs hosts, England qualified for the competition automatically; they were joined by the seven other highest-ranked teams in the ICC ODI Championship as at 30 September 2015.\nVenues.\nOn 1 June 2016, it was announced that the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy would be held across three venues: The Oval, Edgbaston and Sophia Gardens. The ICC confirmed the umpires for all matches and venues on 18 May 2017.\nSquads.\nThe eight participating teams were required to announce a 15-member squad for the tournament on or before 25 April 2017. Teams could make changes to their originally named squads up to 25 May 2017, after which date changes would only be accepted on medical grounds, subject to approval.\nIndia did not announce their squad by 25 April deadline due to what it described as \"operational\" reasons, although this was widely seen as a protest by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in an ongoing disagreement with the ICC over finance and governance. The BCCI were scheduled to announce the squad for India after the ICC board meeting on 27 April 2017. However, on 4 May 2017, after no team had been named, the committee of administrators told the BCCI to select their squad immediately. The BCCI undertook a special general meeting on 7 May 2017 to determine what course of action they would take. The outcome of that meeting was that India would take part in the tournament, and the squad was named on 8 May 2017.\nOn 10 May 2017, the ICC confirmed all the squads for the tournament. Pakistan's Shoaib Malik played in his sixth consecutive Champions Trophy.\nWarm-up matches.\nBefore the tournament started, England and South Africa played a bilateral three-match ODI series leaving the other six teams to play warm-ups against two other teams not in their group. These warm-up matches had rules that were slightly different from normal ODI matches, and were thus not recognised as ODIs. A team could use up to 15 players in a match, but only 11 could bat (or field at any one time) in each innings.\nGroup stage.\nThe fixtures were announced on 1 June 2016.\nKnock-out stage.\nSemi-finals.\nEngland became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals by virtue of two wins in its first two Group A games, and with other teams of the group either losing a game or ending games without a result. Bangladesh qualified for the semi-finals following their win against New Zealand, and Australia failing to beat England in the final match of Group A. From Group B, India and Pakistan qualified for the semi-finals following victories in their final group matches against South Africa and Sri Lanka respectively.\nThe ICC confirmed the umpires for the semi-final matches on 13 June 2017 and for the final on 16 June 2017. Pakistan beat England by 8 wickets to qualify for the final for the first time while India beat Bangladesh by 9 wickets to make their second consecutive appearance and fourth overall in a final.\nTeam of the Tournament.\nThe team of the tournament was named by the ICC the day after the final. The team included seven members of the 22 players who featured in the final, as well as three Englishmen, a Bangladeshi and a New Zealander.\nMedia and promotion.\nIn a media release before the commencement of the tournament, the ICC stated that live broadcast would be made available in \"more than 200 territories, across five continents\". The release added that the tournament's broadcast would reach China, South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia for the first time.\nThe prize money for the competition was increased by $500,000 from 2013 to a total of $4.5 million. The winning team received $2.2 million, with $1.1 million going to the runner-up. The other two semi-finalists earned $450,000 each. Teams finishing third and fourth in each group each received $90,000 and $60,000 respectively."

Moore stayed nine seasons in South Bend, sending all but two of his starting offensive linemen to the NFL, including Aaron Taylor, Andy Heck and Tim Ruddy. He earned a reputation as one of the best line coaches in college football history.\nMoore was the namesake of the Joe Moore Award, awarded annually to the best collegiate football offensive line unit.\nIn 1996 Moore was fired by Notre Dame head coach Bob Davie. Moore contended that it was illegal for Davie to use age as a reason for firing him and a jury agreed, awarding Moore $150,000 in pay and almost $400,000 in legal fees in 1998.\nPrior to joining the Pitt staff in 1977, Moore was head coach at Upper St. Clair High School in suburban Pittsburgh. From 1972-1975 Moore's USC teams were a combined 32-6-2. In 1974 and 1975 USC finished as WPIAL Co-Champions, tying Gateway High School 6-6 in 1974 and Newcastle High School 0-0 in 1975.

The peppery Ortiz, who finished with 17 points, opened the second half with a three-point play off Roberto Yburan while Pumaren and Flores combined for a 7-2 bomb for a 39-21 UE lead.\nCoach Baby Dalupan praised UST for playing \"good basketball\", Losing coach Herminio Silva attributed the team's loss to the Goldies' anemic outside shooting. \"We just can't sink those long shots,\" said Silva."

        "text": "The 1960 UAAP men's basketball tournament was the 23rd year of the men's tournament of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP)'s basketball championship. Hosted by Manila Central University, the UE Warriors defeated the FEU Tamaraws in a single game finals taking their third UAAP men's basketball championship. This was the only season hosted by MCU before its pull-out from the league in 1962.\nSemifinals.\nThe Red Warriors and the Tamaraws advance to the finals by maintaining their clean slates in the championship round. UE routed the University of the Philippines, 87-71, in the first game and FEU kicked defending champion University of Santo Tomas out of contention, 91-81, in the nightcap.\nThe Tamaraws broke away from a sticky fight put up by the Goldies in the early minutes of play and coasted to an easy victory on the record-breaking performance of Romy Diaz, as he scored 40 points, 29 of them in the first half. He held the record for the highest individual score in the season. \nUE’s Roehl Nadurata was the season's Most Valuable Player.\nFinals.\nUniversity of the East nosed out Far Eastern University, 87-86, to win the UAAP basketball crown before 9,000 fans at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum. A lay-up by Ramon Figueroa in the last 15 seconds of play sealed the victory for the Warriors and the four-foot El Oro trophy that went to them permanently for winning their third championship since the trophy was placed at stake. UE copped the championship in 1957 and 1958 but lost the crown to University of Santo Tomas in 1959.\nA dogged stand and heads-up shooting by sophomore Rizaldo Pabillore set up the Warriors’ triumph. The Azcarraga quintet trailed the heavily-favored Tamaraws most of the way but grabbed the reins in the dying minutes of the final half. FEU led 81-75 with three minutes to play but UE staged a magnificent comeback to sew up the ball game. The rally started with a time out by coach Baby Dalupan. Norman de Vera ignited it with two charities on a foul by Rohimust Santos to narrow the gap. Pabillore kept it burning with two interceptions. "

        "text": "The 1965 UAAP men's basketball tournament was the 28th year of the men's tournament of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP)'s basketball championship. Hosted by University of Santo Tomas, the UE Warriors defeated the UST Glowing Goldies two games to one in the best of three finals series taking their sixth overall UAAP men's basketball championship. The finals featured two future inductees to the PBA 25 Greatest Players and Hall of Fame: Danilo Florencio of UST and Robert Jaworski of UE.\nFinals.\nThe best of three games for the 1965 UAAP basketball diadem went to the University of the East, but the hero of the third and decisive match came from the losing team. He was Danilo Florencio, a 19-year old UST forward, whom nobody could stop that night — except the referees. And when Coach Carlos Loyzaga’s prized rookie fouled out in the closing minute after a spectacular 40-point performance, UST's retention bid for crown crumbled under the terrific pressure put on by the mighty UE Warriors.\nAlthough spotty officiating hurt the Goldies more than it did the Warriors — only one of the UST first stringers survived the game — UE could not be denied its hard-earned victory. But for Florencio's superb showing, Chief Warrior Robert Jaworski was the outstanding star of the evening, grabbing those rebounds like nobody's business and scattering 29 precious points, the last two of which came off Florencio's fifth and costly foul and tied the score at 84-all, with 10 seconds to go. At this stage, UST was a badly crippled lot, and Loyzaga had to scrape the bottom of a shallow bench; the reserves he sent in to face a still intact UE first team fell apart with a series of boners which enabled the Warriors to pull two sensational steals and put in four points to clinch the thrill-chocked contest.\nThe ending reminded fans of UST’s triumph in the first of the three-game championship series, when Florencio made two lightning interceptions in the last few seconds to give his team a hairline 69–67 victory. The Warriors evened matters in the second game, 72–65, by blanking George Lizares, one of UST’s chief gunners. And Florencio was not so hot that time, making only 17 points, most of which came rather too late to check a determined UE crew.\nIronically, that night Florencio was at his hottest — the entire UE team practically ganged up on him, to no avail — UST lost the title and made Florencio the most frustrated hero in the history of UAAP cage competitions."

Hosted by University of Santo Tomas, the UE Warriors defeated the NU Bulldogs in the finals taking their eleventh overall and sixth straight UAAP men's basketball championship. The Warriors would eventually win the title the following year achieving a league record seven-peat. This was National University's first finals appearance in 15 years since they were beaten by UST for the title round in 1955. This was also NU's last finals appearance prior to their 2014 championship title.\nFinals.\nUniversity of the East remained the country's top varsity squad for the sixth straight year as the Warriors clobbered the National University Bulldogs, 106-95 for the UAAP basketball title at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum. The temperamental Johnny Revilla pumped in 27 points and had 12 assists as he sparked a savage third quarter attacked that boosted UE to the throne unbeaten for the second straight year.\nRevilla, who maintained his cool for once despite getting deliberately tripped twice, combined with Rudolf Kutch, Rodolfo Soriano and Reynaldo Franco for a 20-4 outburst that gave UE a 20-point bubble at 79-59 going into the last quarter. The splurge left NU gagged for good and all that they could do was whittle the lead at gun-time. \"He has to control his temper when he plays for me\", said Baby Dalupan of Revilla after the match. Indeed, Revilla was a wonderful sight in his \"keep cool\" attitude. When he was not feeding or shooting, the RP youth player was hauling rebounds with authority.\nUE's 46-28 edge in rebounds was enough factor for an early breakaway but its 26 errors stifled the spurt time and again. The Bulldogs, fighting in their first championship in 16 years, took advantage of these UE lapses to cling on to the Warriors' back at the half, 42-44.\nTrivia.\nRafael Altamirano, the uncle of former NU coach Eric Altamirano, played for the Bulldogs in this title match."

        "title": "Swimming shed",
        "text": "Swimming sheds () were built along the sea shore and provided changing rooms and wooden piers for swimmers. They took the form of bamboo huts and were built by the Hong Kong Government in the 20th century.\nSwimming sheds gained popularity in the early 20th century because their entrance fees were cheap. Swimming sheds also leased swimwear, at a rate of $0.3HKD for female swimming suits and cheaper for male swimming suits. This attracted many citizens to use swimming sheds during weekends and holidays.\nHistory.\nIn 1911, Chinese Recreation Club (Hong Kong), built a swimming shed in Tsat Tsz Mui, formerly a village, in eastern North Point. It then became the most popular swimming resort, attracting more than 100 thousands of visitors every year.\nIn the 1950s, there were around 8 to 10 swimming sheds in Hong Kong. Among all these swimming sheds, Chung Sing Swimming Shed and Kam Ngan Swimming Shed were the most famous ones, which were located in Kennedy Town and Mount Davis respectively. Moreover, South China Athletic Association built a swimming shed in A Kung Ngam between 1950 and 1972 and many swimming sheds were also built in Lai Chi Kok Bay, in northern Kowloon, which provided boat rental service.\nIn the 1960s, the Hong Kong Government revoked part of the land area of the swimming shed in certain districts for redevelopment. As harbour pollution problem worsened gradually, more swimming sheds were disintegrated and declined. In 1988, Wan Hung Fai, the regimental commander of beach cottage, and his friend's application on reopening swimming shed in Sai Wai Victoria Road was approved by the Hong Kong Government, making Sai Wai Swimming Shed the one and only swimming shed in Hong Kong now. There were facilities like office, changing rooms for both male and female, lockers etc.; opened to the public from 5:00 am to 1:00 pm, charged HKD$120 per month.\nOn 22 October 2012, Leung Chun-ying, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, pointed out that the water quality of the harbour has been improving since all major sewage treatment and purification projects are nearly completed. He suggested building more swimming sheds on both sides of the harbour, and in turn encouraging people, particularly those working on both sides of the Victoria Harbour, to swim or do a little fishing to reduce stress. However, Professor Ho Kin-chung, Dean of the School of Science and Technology in the Open University of Hong Kong, indicated that the water quality is not suitable for swimming now, not until the completion of the second phase of the effluent treatment projects wraps up. But he agrees that the consideration of building swimming sheds in both sides of the Victoria Harbour is feasible because many citizens swim in Hung Hom and North Point, however, with no facilities provided.\nTourist spot.\nNowadays, the swimming shed is still used by older swimmers and residents of the neighbourhood early in the morning. It is also a popular photo location among enthusiasts and newlyweds.\nSai Wan Swimming Shed.\nSai Wan Swimming Shed is the only shed that is still in service in Hong Kong. It was set by the government in the 1960s to 1970s in which regular swimming facilities weren't common. It is on the brink of the Hong Kong Island, outlining the Victoria Road and Mount Davis. It functions as a hybrid of swimming lot and photo-taking spot for photography lovers, for its vantage point which helps visitors see the small island to the West of the shed, the beacon and the sunset. Users could also get changed and store their personal belongings in the shed. After settling down, swimmers walk along the shed and start enjoying their laps.\nAccidents.\nOn 29 September 2007 in Victoria Road and Deep Water Bay, a swimmer drowned in an early morning accident. The swimmer, who worked in Sai Wan Swimming Shed, was swimming after work. She was sent to hospital after being rescued, however her situation was critical and she died that night. Another woman drowned while swimming at Deep Water Bay.\nTwo elderly women drowned yesterday morning when swimming. A woman (Ms Zhang, 70) from the Swimming Shed drowned. It is reported that Zhang had developed swimming habits over 20 years.\nThat accident happened at the Victoria Road Old Mount Village beach. It was administered by two committees. Members are mostly elders and are interested in early swimming and winter swimming. There is no lifeguard at the Swimming shed. Swimmers only take care of the friends of each other. Sometimes when vessels pass the sea waves can be rather high, though local people are accustomed to early morning swimming. They said that they do not travel too far as there are dangers and could be threatening."

The season started with Pakistan leading the Test cricket rankings, Australia leading the ODI rankings, New Zealand leading the Twenty20 rankings, and Australia women leading the Women's rankings.\nMen's full member cricket started with New Zealand's tour to India. India's 3–0 win over New Zealand in the Test series saw India move up to first in the Test rankings. This tour also saw several milestones in Indian cricket with the first Test of the series being India's 500th Test match, the second Test of the series being India's 250th Test at home, and the first ODI being India's 900th ODI. Notable highlights in this season include Bangladesh's first ever Test victory over England in a two-match series tied 1–1, and South Africa's third consecutive Test series victory against Australia in Australia. However, South Africa's tour to Australia suffered from controversy as the International Cricket Council (ICC) charged Faf du Plessis, South Africa's captain with ball tampering. New Zealand managed to win its first Test series against Pakistan since 1985. India won the Test series against England, contested for the Anthony de Mello Trophy, for the first time since 2008. The tenth edition of the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy, which was held in Australia, was won by Australia 3–0, and the eleventh edition, which was held in New Zealand, was won by New Zealand 2–0. Bangladesh played its first ever Test match in India, which India won by 208 runs. There was one international tournament, a tri-series in Zimbabwe which also contained Sri Lanka and the West Indies, which was won by Sri Lanka. The season also witnessed Sri Lanka's first ever series win in any format against South Africa in South Africa when they won the T20I series 2–1. South Africa recorded twelve consecutive ODI wins that included a whitewash of Australia and Sri Lanka at home. The final Test series of the season saw Pakistan win their first ever Test series in the West Indies.\nIn men's associate and affiliate cricket, three matches of the Intercontinental Cup and six matches of the World Cricket League Championship were scheduled to take place. The results of these matches have so far seen Papua New Guinea move into first place in the World Cricket League Championship and fourth in the Intercontinental Cup. Additional international tours and tournaments were also scheduled among the top associates and affiliates: UAE vs Oman, Hong Kong vs Papua New Guinea, Afghanistan vs Ireland, the 2017 Desert T20 Challenge, and the 2016–17 United Arab Emirates Tri-Nation Series. Afghanistan also played a three match series against Bangladesh (losing 2–1), and Ireland played ODIs against South Africa and Australia, losing both. In addition, another step in the 2019 Cricket World Cup qualification process was completed with the United States and Oman being promoted into World Cricket League Division 3.\nThis season also saw conclusion of the 2014–16 ICC Women's Championship, with the final seven series (matches from rounds 6 and 7) being scheduled in this period. At the conclusion of these matches, Australia, England, New Zealand, and the West Indies were the top four teams of the tournament, and therefore gained direct qualification for the 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup. The bottom four teams (India, South Africa, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) are placed in the 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier, along with Bangladesh, Ireland, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Papua New Guinea and Scotland. There was some controversy, however, as the series between India and Pakistan was supposed to be scheduled in this time period, but the series never went ahead. As a result, the ICC Technical Committee ruled that India's Women's team had forfeited all of the matches, with the points being awarded to Pakistan, effectively consigning India to the bottom four. The 2016 Women's Twenty20 Asia Cup was also played during this season, with India winning their sixth consecutive title. The tournament opener, between India and Bangladesh, saw history as Bangladesh was bowled out for 54, which is the lowest total in Women's Twenty20 Internationals. However, this record stood for only four days, as later on in the tournament, Bangladesh were bowled out for 44 by Pakistan.\nRankings.\nThe following are the rankings at the beginning of the season:"

He named his stand-in Faf du Plessis as replacement, a move that was confirmed by Cricket South Africa (CSA). Immediately prior to this series, du Plessis was found guilty of ball tampering during the second Test against Australia that took place in November 2016. He appealed the charge, but it was rejected. He lost his match fee from the second Test, but escaped the more serious charge of a one-match ban. De Villiers returned to team when he was named captain for the ODI fixtures. He also played in the third and final T20I match, with Farhaan Behardien retained as captain.\nSouth Africa won the Test series 3–0. Sri Lanka won the T20I series 2–1, their first ever series win in any format in South Africa. South Africa won the ODI series 5–0 and moved to the number one position in the ICC ODI Championship.\nSquads.\nDuanne Olivier was added to South Africa's squad following the second Test to replace Kyle Abbott, who earlier had quit international cricket to sign for the English team Hampshire as a Kolpak player.

        "text": "Colin Fraser (born January 28, 1985) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. He played in the National Hockey League for the Chicago Blackhawks, Edmonton Oilers, Los Angeles Kings and the St. Louis Blues. Fraser is a two-time Stanley Cup champion, having won the Cup with the Blackhawks in 2010, and the Kings in 2012. Fraser was a part of the Kings for the 2014 season, but failed to have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup that year. After retiring from professional hockey in 2015, Fraser returned to the Blackhawks to work in their scouting department.\nPlaying career.\nMinor/Junior.\nFraser was born in Sicamous, but raised in Surrey, British Columbia. Growing up, he played minor hockey with the Pacific Vipers of Vancouver with future Chicago Blackhawks teammates Brent Seabrook, Andrew Ladd and Troy Brouwer. He went on to play major junior in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Red Deer Rebels for four years. He spent time as their team captain. Following a 52-point campaign in his second WHL season, Fraser was drafted in the third round, 69th overall, by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. In the subsequent season after being drafted by the Flyers, Fraser was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks on February 19, 2004, while still in the WHL, along with Jim Vandermeer and a second round selection (Bryan Bickell) in 2004 in exchange for Alexei Zhamnov and a fourth round selection (R. J. Anderson) in 2004.\nProfessional.\nIn the subsequent season after being drafted by the Flyers and while still in the WHL, Fraser was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks on February 19, 2004, along with Jim Vandermeer and a second-round draft pick (Bryan Bickell) in 2004 in exchange for Alexei Zhamnov and a 2004 fourth-round pick (R. J. Anderson). \nTurning professional in 2004–05, Fraser made his debut with the Blackhawks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals, appearing in a handful of games following the completion of his fourth and final WHL season. He remained in Norfolk for several seasons and made his NHL debut with the Blackhawks in 2006–07, dressing for one game. In 2007–08, the Rockford IceHogs became Chicago's AHL affiliate, where Fraser scored an AHL career-high 41 points while also playing in five games for the Blackhawks.\nDuring the 2009–10 season, Fraser won the Stanley Cup while playing with the Chicago Blackhawks; he played in three playoff games (all in the frist round against the Nashville Predators. On June 24, 2010, it was announced that he was traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for a 2010 sixth-round draft choice (Mirko Hoefflin).\nOn June 26, 2011, Fraser was traded by the Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings, along with a seventh-round pick in 2012, for Ryan Smyth. Fraser scored the Kings' first goal in Game 1 of the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals against the New Jersey Devils, a 2–1 Kings overtime victory. He won his second Stanley Cup on June 11, 2012, with the Kings. He then signed a two-year, $1.65 million contract extension on June 23. \nOn February 8, 2014, the Kings placed Fraser on waivers for the purpose of demoting him to the Manchester Monarchs of the AHL. On April 22, the Kings then recalled Fraser during the first round of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs against the San Jose Sharks; however, he did not appear in any playoff games and was not an official member of the Kings' Stanley Cup-winning team; his name was not engraved on the Cup.\nOn September 5, 2014, the St. Louis Blues announced that they had signed Fraser to a one-year, two-way contract. He did not win a place with the Blues during training camp and, after clearing waivers, was assigned to the Chicago Wolves, their AHL affiliate. On December 31, 2014, Fraser was recalled by St. Louis from the Wolves and subsequently played his first game for the Blues against the Anaheim Ducks on January 2, 2015.\nOn June 16, 2015, as an impending free agent, Fraser signed to continue his career in Europe in agreeing to a one-year contract with German club, the Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. In the midst of the 2015–16 season, Fraser had appeared in 17 games for the Ice Tigers, registering 5 assists, before opting to immediately retire from professional hockey due to personal reasons on November 18, 2015.\nAfter retiring from professional ice hockey, Fraser became an amateur scout for his former team, the Chicago Blackhawks.\nInternational play.\nDuring his junior career, Fraser competed for Canada at the 2005 World Junior Championships in Grand Forks. He recorded five points in six games, helping Canada to a gold medal win against Russia in the Final. The gold medal marked Canada's first championship of a five-year run."

        "text": "Andrew Patrick Stevenson (born June 1, 1994) is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals and Minnesota Twins.\nLittle League.\nStevenson was a member of the Lafayette Little League team that represented Lafayette, Louisiana and the Southwest region at the 2005 Little League World Series.\nCollege career.\nStevenson played college baseball at Louisiana State University (LSU) from 2013 to 2015. \nAfter his sophomore season in 2014, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Yarmouth–Dennis Red Sox of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he batted .311 with 23 stolen bases in 53 games, was named to the 2014 All-League team, and helped lead the Red Sox to the league championship. At LSU, he was a teammate of shortstop Alex Bregman, the second overall pick in the 2015 draft by the Houston Astros. In both Stevenson and Bregman's final season of college ball, the LSU Tigers reached the 2015 College World Series. \"En route\" to the Tigers' World Series berth, Stevenson attracted media attention with an outstanding defensive play in center field. Playing behind starting pitcher Jared Poche, Stevenson leaped toward the warning track and laid out to take away a likely RBI extra-base hit from the University of North Carolina Wilmington's designated hitter. He then scrambled to his feet and threw from deep center field to the second baseman, doubling up the runner on base. \"The Times-Picayune\", writing about the game, referred to Stevenson's play as \"The Catch\" and compared the LSU outfielder to American football wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., known for his athletic plays on the field. The Tigers ultimately were eliminated in the World Series by the TCU Horned Frogs.\nProfessional career.\nWashington Nationals.\n2015.\nStevenson was drafted by the Washington Nationals in the second round of the 2015 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Nationals and made his professional debut that year with the Gulf Coast Nationals. He was later promoted to the Auburn Doubledays and Hagerstown Suns. In 55 games between the three teams, he batted .308/.363/.379 with one home run, 25 RBIs, and 23 stolen bases.\n2016.\nStevenson spent 2016 playing for the High-A Potomac Nationals and Class-AA Harrisburg Senators. In 133 combined games, he compiled a .276 batting average with three home runs, 34 RBIs, and 39 stolen bases. After the season, Stevenson was one of a handful of Nationals prospects to play in the Arizona Fall League. Playing for the Glendale Desert Dogs, he led the AFL in hits with 30 and posted a .353 batting average, second in the league, and was named along with Desert Dogs and Senators teammate Drew Ward to the 2016 AFL Top Prospects Team.\nAfter Lucas Giolito, Reynaldo Lopez and Dane Dunning were traded to the Chicago White Sox in December 2016, Stevenson ranked as the Nationals' fifth-best prospect, according to MLB.com.\n2017.\nStevenson received an invitation to major league camp in the 2017 season. He played well, impressing Nationals manager Dusty Baker, who remarked of the outfielder, \"He's always ready. When I look down there, he's already looking at me.\" Stevenson was reassigned to minor league camp on March 13.\nAfter beginning his season with Class-AA Harrisburg and hitting .316 in April, Stevenson was promoted to the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs. Stevenson struggled in the early going with Syracuse, hitting just .169 over his first 31 games before turning his game around. After amassing a .246 batting average overall as a Chief, Stevenson was promoted to the major leagues on July 23, 2017, after outfielders Chris Heisey and Ryan Raburn were placed on the disabled list and bereavement list, respectively. He made his major league debut the same day, pinch-hitting and coming in on a double switch in the sixth inning to play left field. On July 27, Stevenson notched his first major league hit, lining a pitch into right field off Hernán Pérez of the Milwaukee Brewers — a utility player pitching in the major leagues for the first time, with his team trailing by 13 runs in the bottom of the eighth inning — for a single. The following month, on August 10, he made a diving catch down the left field line to take away an RBI and extra bases from Miami Marlins second baseman Dee Gordon with two outs in the top of the ninth, preserving a 3–2 lead in the game as Nationals closer Sean Doolittle locked down the save. On August 27, Stevenson recorded his first major league RBI with a go-ahead, bases-loaded walk against the New York Mets that gave the Nationals a 5-4 victory. On August 28, the Nationals optioned Stevenson back to Syracuse following the return of left fielder Jayson Werth from the disabled list. On September 7, the Nationals recalled Stevenson. He finished the regular season with the Nationals, having appeared in 37 games, batting .158 with an RBI and a stolen base.\n2018.\nStevenson began the 2018 season with the Triple–A Syracuse Chiefs, but the Nationals called him up to the major leagues on April 16. Stevenson entered a game on April 25 against the San Francisco Giants at AT&amp;T Park with only 10 major-league hits and two major-league RBIs in his career, but, playing in left field that day, he went 4-for-5 from the plate with two doubles and a walk and scored two runs as part of a Nationals offensive explosion that ended in a 15–2 Washington victory. After Stevenson appeared in 25 games for Washington, hitting .255 with eight RBIs, the Nationals optioned him back to Syracuse on June 1.\n2019.\nIn 2019 he batted .367/.486/.467 in 30 at bats.\n2019 would also see him make his postseason debut: pinch-running for Ryan Zimmerman in the 8th inning of the Wild Card Game against the Milwaukee Brewers, he would score the tying run on Juan Soto’s single; acting aggressively due to Stevenson’s speed, Brewers right fielder Trent Grisham misplayed the ball, allowing the eventual winning run to score as well. While not on the playoff roster for the rest of the Nationals’ championship run, Stevenson would take the field before Game 3 of the World Series to catch the ceremonial first pitch from Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin.\n2020.\nIn 2020 he batted .366/.447/.732 in 41 at bats. He had the fastest home run trot of all major league players, at 17.3 seconds.\n2021.\nIn 2021, Stevenson spent the majority of the year with Washington, also playing in 15 games for the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings. In 109 games for the Nationals, Stevenson slashed .229/.294/.339 with 5 home runs and 23 RBI.\n2022.\nOn April 2, 2022, Stevenson was outrighted off of the 40-man roster.

He is considered to be one of the faster players in professional baseball, with highly rated defense in center field, although baseball writer John Sickels in 2016 questioned his arm strength and ability to hit consistently. He has a compact swing with great bat speed, but he is not considered a power hitter."

        "text": "Gambit Esports, formerly Gambit Gaming, is an inactive Russian esports organization owned by telecommunications company MTS. It was established in January 2013 after the acquisition of the former \"League of Legends\" roster of Moscow Five.\nGambit has teams competing in \"Apex Legends\", \"Dota 2\", \"Fortnite Battle Royale\", and \"Valorant\". It previously had a \"League of Legends\" team competing in the European \"League of Legends\" Championship Series (EU LCS), and later the \"League of Legends\" Continental League (LCL).\n\"Counter-Strike:Global Offensive\".\nHistory.\nOn 8 January 2016, Gambit acquired a \"CS:GO\" roster consisting mostly of former HellRaisers players. The players were Mikhail \"Dosia\" Stolyarov, Dauren \"AdreN\" Kystaubayev, Rustem \"mou\" Telepov, Dmitry \"hooch\" Bogdanov, and Jan \"wayLander\" Rahkonen. Gambit qualified for MLG Columbus 2016, beating Renegades and Cloud9 in the offline qualifier and later placed 9–12th at the main event. Gambit announced the departure of wayLander on 18 April 2016 and officially signed Ivan \"spaze\" Obrezhan on 19 April 2016. Gambit removed spaze from the active roster on 24 September 2016 and used Emil \"kUcheR\" Akhundov as a stand-in. Dmitry \"hooch\" Bogdanov was removed from the team on 2 October 2016. Daniil \"Zeus\" Teslenko and Abay \"HObbit\" Khasenov joined Gambit on 12 October, the latter being a six-month loan from the Kazakhstani team Tengri. Gambit won Acer Predator Masters 3 after beating Team Kinguin 3–0 in the finals on 5 November 2016.\nOn 23 July 2017, Gambit defeated Immortals 2–1 in the grand final of the PGL Major 2017 in Krakow.\nOn 9 August 2017, Zeus and Kane stepped down from Gambit to join Natus Vincere.\nOn 5 September 2020, Gambit Youngsters coach Ivan \"⁠F_1N⁠\" Kochugov admitted using the coaching bug that allowed him to give information about enemy players. He was suspended by Gambit.\nOn 5 October 2020, Gambit promoted its academy team, Gambit Youngsters, to the main line-up, after they managed to stay in the weekly updated HLTV top 30 ranking for 12 consecutive weeks.\nOn April 24 2022, Gambit sold its roster to Cloud9 following bans from various event organizers due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\"League of Legends\".\nHistory.\nEU LCS (2013–2015).\nOn 10 January 2013, the now-defunct esports organisation Moscow Five released their \"League of Legends\" roster that achieved 3rd–4th place at the ; this was in part due to the arrest of their CEO Dmitry Smilianets in July 2013, which left the organisation with a lack of funding for several months. Four days later, on 14 January, it was announced that Gambit Gaming had acquired the former M5 roster.\nMarking their first appearance in an offline event as Gambit Gaming, in late January 2013, the Russian team would compete in IEM Season VII - Global Challenge Katowice as one of the eight qualified teams. Gambit Gaming would go 1–2 in the group stage, winning against MYM, while losing to Curse Gaming EU and Azubu Blaze. Because of this, the round robin had a tie between MYM, Gambit and Curse Gaming EU, all of whom went 1–2. A time coefficient was used to break the tie, giving Gambit Gaming a spot in the semi-finals. Gambit Gaming, as the underdogs, would defeat Azubu Frost 2–0, then go on to take first place by knocking out Korean powerhouse Azubu Blaze, who they had lost to in the group stage.\nHaving qualified as Moscow Five, Gambit Gaming would compete in the European Season 3 \"League of Legends\" Championship Series. They would complete the European Spring LCS Split in 2nd place, with a record of 21–7. This ensured their LCS spot for the summer split portion of the league. They would then take second place in the Season 3 EU Spring Playoffs, losing 2–3 to Fnatic in the final.\nGambit attended the IEM Season VII - World Championship in Hannover, Germany in March. The team dominated their group, going undefeated with a 5–0 score, placing them in the semi-finals. They then faced CJ Entus Frost and lost the set 2–1, knocking Gambit out of the tournament and seeing them finish in 3rd overall.\nThe Russian team was invited to play in an international exhibition at 2013 MLG Winter Championship, playing first against Americans Team Dignitas, they won 2–0, by constantly pressuring their opponent. Gambit then faced Korean top contender KT Rolster B in the exhibition finals but were unable to beat them and secure 1st place, losing the match 2–1.\nIn April 2013, Gambit Gaming players Danil \"Diamondprox\" Reshetnikov, Aleksei \"Alex Ich\" Ichetovkin, Evgeny \"Genja\" Andryushin, and Edward \"Edward\" Abgaryan were publicly voted to represent their respective positions on the Europe LCS All Star team, to compete at All-Star Shanghai 2013 and play against the world's best All Star teams, chosen in the same fashion. However, a rule stating that only 3 members of any team, could be inducted onto the team caused Genja to be replaced as AD Carry by Evil Geniuses' Yellowpete. The team's top lane was sOAZ from Fnatic. The EU LCS first faced off against heavy favorites Korean OGN Champions, and although good early game play from jungler Diamondprox looked promising for the team, the Koreans overtook them in a 2-0 set. Their next opponent was from their sibling league, the North America LCS. NA LCS ended up being the victor, knocking the EU LCS out of the tournament.\nIn July 2013, GoSu Papper left the team to join Team Curse.\nOn 17 August 2013, Gambit Gaming would finish the Summer Split tied up for 2nd place, at 15–13, along with Fnatic, Evil Geniuses and Ninjas in Pyjamas. However they managed to secure a 4th-place finish after losing the tie breaker against Evil Geniuses, going on to defeat Ninjas in Pyjamas in the losers bracket then losing again to Evil Geniuses in the deciders match, which granted Gambit Gaming a spot on the Summer Playoffs.\nGambit would then play against Ninjas in Pyjamas in the Summer Playoffs, defeating them 2-0 and advancing to the Semifinals where they would lose 0–2 against Lemondogs, dropping the 3rd Place Match to face Evil Geniuses, in a match that decided the third team that would represent Europe in the Season 3 World Championship. Gambit was victorious and claimed the win over Evil Geniuses, 2–1.\nGambit was placed into a tough group with fellow European rivals Fnatic, North American third seed Team Vulcun, Korean OGN Spring Winners Samsung Galaxy Ozone and Filipino champions Mineski. They earned an undefeated 3-0 their first day of the group stage, looking extremely strong as Europe's third seed. Gambit continued to play solidly throughout the groups, finishing in a tie for 2nd place with Samsung Galaxy Ozone at 5–3. In a close tiebreaker game against the Korean team, Gambit emerged victorious and advanced to the playoffs with fellow European competitor Fnatic.\nGambit faced off against the Korean first seed NaJin Black Sword in the quarterfinals. NaJin Black Sword was called a \"dark horse threat\" by caster MonteCristo since they had not competed in the previous two months and had recently replaced their starting mid laner, SSONG, with substitute player Nagne. After winning the first game, Gambit succumbed to the Koreans 1–2, thus being eliminated from the tournament and taking home seventh place.\nGambit's first tournament in the 2014 season was the IEM World Championship. The team were knocked out in the semifinals by KT Rolster Bullets.\nThe Spring Split was a slight disappointment for Gambit. Also, due to visa issues, Darien, Diamondprox, Alex Ich, and Genja were all unable to play in the 6th week of the Spring Season. Zorozero, Hulberto, Nukeduck, and fury III substituted for Top, Jungle, Mid, and ADC respectively. The team ended up coming in 5th in the tournament, after losing to Team ROCCAT in the quarterfinals.\nIn May Alex Ich left Gambit for Challenger Series team Ninjas in Pyjamas to spend more time with his family. His departure from Gambit ultimately meant that the Summer Split would be worse for the team than the spring split. Gambit struggled throughout, with Darien, Diamondprox and Genja becoming substitutes for periods over the split. The team finished in 7th place, meaning that they would have to fight for their LCS status in the Spring Promotion. \nDue to their 1st-place finish at IEM Cologne, the team were invited to compete at the IEM Season IX - World Championship. After a Round 1 loss against CJ Entus, Gambit Gaming were knocked out of the tournament, losing to Team WE in Round 1 of the losers bracket. Domestically, they finished fourth in the spring LCS round robin and then tied for fifth with Copenhagen Wolves in the playoffs after a quarterfinal loss to Unicorns Of Love. After the playoffs, the team released Leviathan from his position as head coach, citing commitment issues in the latter half of the season.\nGambit Gaming had an unsuccessful Summer Split. After a rocky early start to the season and a combined 0–4 record in the first two weeks, Gambit improved to fifth place after 8 weeks, largely thanks to the coaching of Shaunz. At one point the team had the potential of finishing as high as fourth. However, going into the last week of the split, FORG1VEN received a four-game-long penalty from Riot as the result of toxic behavior in soloqueue. Moopz subbed in as the team's AD carry for the last 2 games of the split. Losing these 2 games, the team finished the regular season in 8th place, meaning that they would be playing in the 2016 Spring Promotion. \nGambit's LCS spot was sold to Team Vitality in December 2015.\nLCL (2016–2021).\nOn 12 January 2016, Gambit reentered the professional \"League of Legends\" scene after acquiring a spot in the newly formed LCL challenger series. The team branded itself as Gambit.CIS and fielded a new roster consisting of Fomko, LeX, Archie, BloodFenix and FatoNN.\nAfter playing through the challenger series, Gambit qualified for the promotion tournament, where they defeated Team Differential 3-0 and qualified for the League of Legends Continental League (LCL). The team then finished 6th in the 2016 LCL Summer Split with a record of 6–8.\nGambit ended at the second place of group stage with 9 wins and 5 losses, securing a playoff spot. In playoffs, Gambit beat Team Just 3–2 in the semifinals and Dragon Army 3–1 in the finals to win the split and qualify for the 2018 World Championship Play-in Stage.\nGambit was drawn in Play-in stage Group D with G-Rex from Hong Kong (LMS) and Kaos Latin Gamers from Latin America South. They lost both games to G-Rex but won both games against Kaos Latin Gamers and qualified for Play-in stage round 2 at 2nd place. Gambit was drawn against Cloud9 from North America in round 2 and lost 2–3, therefore not qualifying to the main event group stage.\n\"Dota 2\".\nOn February 9, 2021, Gambit Esports enters a partnership with football club AS Monaco. The team was rebranded to AS Monaco Gambit. On February 11 a new roster was announced consisting of then Live to Win's roster and No[o]ne joins as a stand-in. The former team continued to play together under the name of Gambit-2.\n\"Valorant\".\nOn 28 September 2020, Gambit Esports entered the professional \"Valorant\" scene by announcing their first roster.\nOn 20 September 2021, they defeated Team Envy in the finals and won the Valorant Champions Tour Masters Berlin 2021.\nOn 12 December 2021, Gambit reached the final of the first edition of the VALORANT Champions, losing to Acend 2–3."

It involved eight professional rugby union teams, one team fewer than in the previous two seasons. The competition kicked off on 27 August 2016.\nTeams.\nA major change was made for the 2016 season with the scrapping of the Sydney Stars team. The Australian Rugby Union did not renew their licence for the competition to consolidate playing strength of the teams in New South Wales. The North Harbour Rays subsequently changed their name to become the Sydney Rays. Prior to the season it was also reported that the Canberra Vikings would be renamed the Canberra Kookaburras in a return to the traditional name of the ACT team, but this change was postponed until at least the 2017 season.\nThe eight teams for the 2016 NRC season include three from New South Wales, two from Queensland, and one each from Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, and Western Australia:\nHome match venues scheduled for the 2016 NRC season:\nTelevision coverage and streaming.\nTwo of the NRC matches each weekend were broadcast live via Fox Sports, with the other matches shown on the Fox Sports streaming platform. Discussion of the NRC competition was included on Fox Sports' review show NRC Extra Time on Monday nights, and the Rugby 360 program on Wednesday evenings.\nExperimental Law Variations.\nThe most significant new law variation adopted for the 2016 season was the further change in point scoring values, with tries made worth six points and any form of goal worth two points.\nTwo of the scrum law variations trialed since the since the inaugural season of the National Rugby Championship in 2014 were adopted (along with other minor amendments) into World Rugby's laws in 2016 and were thus no longer law variations. These changes to Law 20.1(d) and Law 20.12(c) sanctioned against delay in forming a scrum, and against a scrum half whose team has not won the ball stepping onto the space between the position flanker and No. 8 while the ball is in the scrum.\nThe other law variations used in 2014 and 2015, were retained for the 2016 season.\nRegular season.\nThe eight teams compete in a round-robin tournament for the regular season. Each team has four matches at home and four away. The top four teams qualify for the title play-offs with semi-finals and finals.\nDuring this section of the tournament, teams can also play for the Horan-Little Shield, a challenge trophy that is played for when a challenge is accepted or offered by the holders.\nTitle play-offs.\nThe top four sides in the regular season advanced to the semifinals of the knock-out stage, which was followed by the final to decide the National Rugby Championship title.\nPlayers.\nThe leading scorers in 2016 over the regular season and finals combined were:\nNotes.\n The venue for the Round 5 fixture between NSW Country Eagles and Perth Spirit was moved from Orange due to heavy rains causing Endeavour Oval to become waterlogged.

        "text": "The 2015–16 NCAA Division I women's basketball season began in November and ended with the Final Four in Indianapolis, April 3–5. Practices officially began on October 3.\nThis season of NCAA women's basketball games was the first to be played in 10-minute quarters, the standard for FIBA and WNBA play.\nOther NCAA changes.\nIn addition to the change to quarter play, the NCAA also affords each team three 30-second timeouts and one 60-second timeout per game, and a media timeout will occur at the first dead ball after the 5:00 mark of each quarter. If a timeout is called before the 5:00 mark, that timeout replaces the media timeout. Teams will also be allowed to advance the ball to the front court following a timeout after a made basket, a rebound or change in possession in the last minute of the fourth quarter or any overtime periods.\nThe bonus situation has also changed, with teams reaching the bonus on the fifth foul of each quarter, where they will be awarded two free throws. Previously, teams shot one-and-one on the seventh foul of the half and reached the two-shot double bonus on the 10th foul. Fouls will reset following each quarter, with all overtime periods counting as extensions of the fourth quarter.\nPre-season polls.\nThe top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaches Polls.\nPostseason.\nConference winners and tournaments.\nThirty-one athletic conferences each ended their regular seasons with a single-elimination tournament. The team with the best regular-season record in each conference was given the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers used as needed in the case of ties for the top seeding. All conferences also recognize regular-season champions, with co-championships being awarded in the case of ties. The winners of these tournaments receive automatic invitations to the 2016 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament. For the final time, the Ivy League did not hold a conference tournament, instead giving its automatic invitation to its regular season champion; in case of a tie for the regular-season title (which did not happen this season), the automatic berth would have been decided by a one-game playoff (or series of one-game playoffs if more than two teams were tied).\nNCAA tournament.\nTournament upsets.\nFor this list, a \"major upset\" is defined as a win by a team seeded 7 or more spots below its defeated opponent.\nAward winners.\nAll-America teams.\nThe NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the Associated Press (AP), the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), the \"Sporting News\", and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nHowever, of the major selectors in women's basketball, only the AP divides its selections into separate teams. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), selects a single 10-member (plus ties) team, as does the USBWA. The NCAA does not recognize \"Sporting News\" as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\nAP 3rd Team&lt;br&gt;\nThird Team All-Americans&lt;br&gt;\nJillian Alleyne, Oregon, F, 6-3, sr.&lt;br&gt;\nMyisha Hines-Allen, Louisville, F, 6-2, so.&lt;br&gt;\nTiffany Mitchell, South Carolina, G, 5-9, sr.

The HFMoP, together with LIRFL, PRL and other organisations, founded the World Rugby League to run their own rugby league organisation on an international scale.\nThe Greek Rugby League Association (GRLA) has been recognised by the RLEF as the governing body of rugby league in Greece since March 2017. The conflict between the HFRL/HFMP and the RLIF continued, but ended in August 2022 when the Greek government recognised the GRLA as the governing body for the sport in Greece."

        "text": "Sydney Raphael Lee (25 April 1910 – 10 November 1986) was an English professional billiards and snooker player. He was four times a quarter-finalist in the World Snooker Championship during the first half of the twentieth century. He was a snooker referee on \"Pot Black\". He was the game consultant for a 1970 episode of Steptoe and Son entitled \"Pot Black\" and, as well as performing a number of trick shots was the stand-in for many of the more difficult regular shots seen in the show.\nCareer.\nLee enjoyed considerable success as an amateur billiards player. He won the boys championship in May 1925 but lost to Reggie Gartland in the 1926 event. The winner of the boys championship was presented with the \"Harry Lee Challenge Cup\", which had been donated by his father. He was also runner-up in the English Amateur Billiards Championship in 1929 and won it 4 times in succession from 1931 to 1934. He was runner-up in the Empire Billiards Championship in Sydney in 1931 and winner when the event was next held, in London in 1933.\nLee turned professional in March 1934 after his fourth English Amateur Billiards Championship. He played competitive professional snooker in 1935, entering the 1936 World Championship. In his first match, he faced Clare O'Donnell, and having trailed 4–8, recovered to lead 15–13; however, O'Donnell won the next three frames to prevail 16–15.\nHis effort at the next World Championship concluded similarly, Lee losing his first match 11–20 to Horace Lindrum, and the same followed in 1938, when he lost 7–24 to Joe Davis.\nHaving lost to Sydney Smith in the 1939 World Championship, Lee played in the 1939/1940 Daily Mail Gold Cup; there, he defeated Smith, Walter Donaldson, Alec Brown and Tom Newman, but lost to both Joe Davis and Fred Davis. Brown finished top of the group, winning the competition. At that year's World Championship, Lee lost 11–20 again, this time to Fred Davis.\nUpon the resumption of that tournament in 1946, Lee had no more luck than in his previous attempts, losing his first match 12–19 to Stanley Newman. However, he did enjoy a victory in the 1947 edition, beating Jim Lees 19–16, before losing 10–25 in the second round to Willie Leigh.\nLee progressed to the third round of the 1950 World Championship, defeating Canadian Con Stanbury and Herbert Holt, but lost at that stage, 14–21 to Kingsley Kennerley.\nLee entered the 1974 World Championship and was seeded to the first round. There, he met John Pulman, but scored only 210 points as the latter whitewashed him 8–0."

The tournament was held in France from 30 October, culminating in the final between France and Great Britain on 13 November.\nMatch details.\nThe BBC broadcast the whole match live in the UK via the Television Continental Exchange – a rare novelty for the time. France opened the scoring with a penalty Puig-Aubert kick from 45 yards out and played well early in the match, leading early in the second half thanks to a brilliant try from Cantoni. However Great Britain did not waver, with credit for the win given to a starring role by centre Phil Jackson and the play of their forward pack, as well as the tough match France had played against Australia in Nantes two days earlier. Great Britain defeated France 16–12 and became the first team to lift the World Cup."

He played college football at the University of Tennessee.\nEarly years.\nWarren attended Wayne County High School where he was considered the state's best punter. Additionally, he was the team's placekicker. \nHe practiced baseball and was drafted out of high school by the Cincinnati Reds.\nCollege careers.\nAfter receiving Division I NCAA scholarships offers from different schools, he settled on the University of Tennessee. His best season came as a freshman, registering 52 punts for 2,106 yards and a 40.5-yard average. In his last two years he was a backup behind Jimmy Colquitt, with Warren handling the directional punts.\nHe finished his college career posting 42 games, 133 punts, 5,289 yards and a 39.8-yard average. He also practiced baseball.\nProfessional career.\nWarren was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1983 NFL Draft.\nIn the 70's and early 80's, the Cowboys had the luxury that they didn't need to carry a punter on their roster, because quarterback Danny White could perform that task at a high level. After he was injured in the 1982 NFC championship and placekicker Rafael Septién was forced to be the punter replacement, the team decided to carry Warren as the punter for the 1983 season. As a rookie, he shared punting duties with White, until being placed on the injured reserve list after suffering a right knee injury while covering one of his punts against the Los Angeles Raiders.\nIn 1984, he became part of a revolving door, where he was released and signed on different times during the season. On August 19, 1985, he was waived after being passed on the depth chart by Mike Saxon."

It is a cross-border organisation administering the sport in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\nRowing Ireland is a member of the Olympic Council of Ireland and the Fédération Internationale des Sociétés d’Aviron (FISA).\nMembership.\nIn excess of 100 clubs are affiliated to Rowing Ireland. These are from every part of the island and include schools, third level institutions and open clubs.\nIn 2019 Rowing Ireland launched its strategy until 2024. This has four pillars: Supporting clubs, High Performance, Rowing for all and Leading our sport.\nNational Rowing Centre.\nThe National Rowing Centre (NRC) in Farran Wood, Cork is the headquarters of Rowing Ireland and is also the base of the High Performance team. The centre has an eight-lane Albano course and hosts a number of regattas and the Championship Regatta each year. Every four years it hosts the Home International Regatta. In 1999 and 2008 it hosted the Coupe de la Jeunesse It successfully hosted the event again in 2018.\nIrish Championships.\nEstablished in 1899 as the Irish Amateur Rowing Union, the association hosted its first championship in 1912. At the 1912 AGM, which was held in February, it was agreed that a cup be purchased for £100 for the Union to be presented for annual competition amongst senior eights. This would in time become known as \"The Big Pot\".\nThe inaugural Senior eights championship took place at Metropolitan Regatta in Ringsend on the Lower Liffey in July 1912 and City of Derry Boating Club were the winners. It would be 1934 before the Junior (Intermediate) eights championship was added. Since then many additional championships have been added and 44 are now contested each year at the Championship Regatta. In 2017 it added the Irish Offshore Rowing Championship and in 2018 the inaugural Irish Coastal Rowing Championships took place. The results of all championships can be found at www.irishrowingarchives.com\nNational team.\nRowing Ireland is responsible for the selection and management of the Irish national team, through its High Performance programme. Crews are selected for regattas such as the Olympic Games, World Rowing Championships, European Rowing Championships, and the World Rowing Cup.\nNational squad.\nThis was the team selected for the 2023 World Rowing Championships, held in Belgrade, Serbia.\nPersonnel.\nThis was the coaching and management personnel selected for the 2023 World Rowing Championships, held in Belgrade, Serbia.\nOlympics and Paralympics.\nOlympics.\nIreland first sent a boat to an Olympic regatta to the 1948 Summer Olympics, where they sent a men's eight. The IARU received its affiliation from FISA on the 3rd of August, 1948, two days before the start of the regatta, allowing Ireland to send a crew.\nIt was not until 1972, when Seán Drea entered the men's single sculls, coming seventh. Ireland would go on to field at least one crew at every Olympic regatta except 1984. Four years later, Drea came fourth in the same event.\nAt the 1996 Summer Olympics, the crew in the men's lightweight coxless four consisting of Derek Holland, Sam Lynch, Neville Maxwell and Tony O'Connor also came fourth.\nIt was not until 2016, when brothers Gary and Paul O'Donovan broke through and won Ireland's first Olympic medal in rowing: a silver in the men's lightweight double sculls. The O'Donovans' relaxed interview style endeared followers and they became internet sensations in the wake of their success, and they were invited on to \"The Graham Norton Show\" for its 2016 New Year's Eve special.\nAt the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, Ireland entered thirteen athletes across six boats, more than any other Olympic regatta. The women's coxless four, consisting of Emily Hegarty, Aifric Keogh, Eimear Lambe, and Fiona Murtagh, won a bronze medal, and Paul O'Donovan joined Fintan McCarthy to win Ireland's first rowing gold in the men's lightweight double sculls\nFor the 2024 Summer Olympics, Ireland has so far qualified twelve athletes across six boats.\nParalympics.\nAt the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Ireland fielded a crew in the mixed coxed four. For the 2024 Summer Paralympics, Ireland has qualified a boat for the PR2 mixed double sculls.\nWorld Championships.\nIreland has won sixteen gold, eight silver and eleven bronze medals at the World Rowing Championships.\nEuropean Championships.\nThe European Rowing Championships were re-established in 2007, after a hiatus dating to 1973. At these, Ireland has won six gold, five silver, and five bronze medals."

The organization was founded in Spain on 24 February 2014 as Gamers2 by former \"League of Legends\" pro Carlos \"ocelote\" Rodríguez Santiago and investor Jens Hilgers. The organization rebranded as G2 Esports on 15 October 2015.\nG2's \"League of Legends\" team competes in the \"League of Legends\" EMEA Championship (LEC), the highest level of competitive \"League of Legends\" in Europe. The team has won eleven domestic titles in Europe, the most of any organization, and became the only Western team to win the Mid-Season Invitational in 2019. The organization's \"Rainbow Six Siege\" team competes in the European League (EUL), the highest level of competitive \"Rainbow Six Siege\" in Europe. The team won two World Championships,the only team to do so. First in 2019 by defeating Team Empire at the Six Invitational 2019 final and second at the Six Invitational 2023 following a lower bracket run to the final. The \"CS:GO\" team holds the second longest LAN map winning streak at 22 as well as being one of three teams that has won Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) Katowice and Cologne in the same year.\nOrganization.\nCarlos Rodríguez resigned as CEO of G2 on 23 September 2022, amidst controversy surrounding his acquaintanceship with Andrew Tate. He had previously been suspended from his position after a clip of him partying with Andrew and his brother Tristan Tate went viral. Commentators later suspected this incident to be the reason for G2 being denied a franchise spot in the 2023 season of the Valorant Champions Tour. Carlos Rodriguez was later suspended from Riot-sanctioned competition until 13 November 2022, having to follow a sensitivity and executive training to be allowed back to the LEC.\nCurrent divisions.\n\"League of Legends\".\nHistory.\nGamers2 had made a start for \"League of Legends\" in 2014 with an initial roster of Top laner Jesper \"Jwaow\" Strandgren, jungler Sebastián \"Morden\" Esteban Fernández, Mid laner Carlos \"Ocelote\" Rodríguez, AD carry Soler \"Yuuki60\" Florent, and support Hugo \"Dioud\" Padioleau.\nThe team participated in the Spring Expansion Tournament, beating Reason Gaming in the seeding game and Team Strix in Round 1. G2 were knocked out of the tournament in Round 2 after being beaten by n!faculty.\nG2 Esports was renamed from Gamers2 after qualifying for the 2016 EU LCS Spring Season.\nG2 Esports has also a sister team in Spain competing in the EU Challenger Series, called G2 Vodafone, in representation of their sponsor Vodafone. They qualified for the 2016 EU Challenger Series Summer Split Qualifiers, but failed to qualify for the EU CS. They also won the Spanish 2016 Final Cup Spring Split.\nThe team failed to qualify for the LCS three splits in a row.\nThe team finished 1st in the Challenger Series season. They then took 2nd in the playoffs, thereby qualifying for the 2016 Spring EU LCS. Gamers2 qualified for the LCS by defeating SK Gaming 3–2.\nG2 finished the 2016 EU LCS Spring Split regular season in 1st place. In the playoffs, they defeated Fnatic before winning the 2016 EU LCS in Rotterdam after beating Origen. This also meant that they had qualified for the 2016 Mid-Season Invitational tournament in Shanghai. G2 would represent Europe at the competition against 5 other teams. However, in the weeks before the tournament, the team took an infamous vacation and came to the tournament unprepared. Because of this, they lost 8 of their 10 games, their only two wins against the lowest ranked seed there. This also cost the EU LCS league its 1st seed for the 2016 World Championship later that year. This meant that the 1st seed for Europe of the 2016 Summer EU LCS would be at a disadvantage in the tournament.\nG2 performed well in 2018 and got much further at the 2018 League of Legends World Championship than expected for a team considered an underdog, making it all the way to the Semifinals match. G2 lost to eventual world champion Invictus Gaming in the semis. Something the G2 team of 2018 was known for was unconventional picks in the bot lane; their AD carry Hjarnan was a rare Heimerdinger player.\nG2 retooled their team for the 2019 season, releasing their bottom lane duo of Hjarnan and Wadid, and signing Mikyx as a new support and acquiring Caps as their new midlaner from their regional rival Fnatic. Since the team now had two midlaners, Perkz was sent to the bottom lane to role swap to AD carry. G2 became the first team to be crowned LEC champions after they won its inaugural split post name change from EU LCS on 14 April 2019, in a 3–0 sweep against Origen.\nAfter sweeping Team Liquid from North America 3–0 in the grand final of the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational, G2 became the first European team to win a Riot-sponsored international tournament since Fnatic won the Season 1 World Championship. They finished first in the 2019 LEC Summer Split regular season and later defeated Fnatic 3–2 in the finals to secure their sixth domestic title.\nAt the 2019 \"League of Legends\" World Championship, G2 finished runner-up, losing to Chinese team FunPlus Phoenix in the grand finals.\nIn the 2020 LEC Spring Split, Perkz and Caps role-swapped for the split after Perkz expressed a desire to play mid lane again. G2 came first in the regular season, but lost their first playoff match against MAD Lions, resulting in a drop to the loser's bracket. From there, the team won the three remaining matches and ultimately won the split, claiming their seventh title and tying the record belonging to Fnatic. In Summer, G2 made it to the LEC playoffs; they lost to Fnatic 3–2 in the winner's bracket finals, but defeated Rogue in the loser's bracket finals and then defeated Fnatic in the Grand Finals rematch 3–0 to win the split. At the 2020 League of Legends World Championship, G2 made it to the semifinals, but were eliminated by eventual champion Damwon Gaming and finished in 3rd/4th place.\nG2 revamped its roster for the 2021 LEC season, notably with trading longtime team captain Perkz to Cloud9 and acquiring Martin \"Rekkles\" Larson from Fnatic. While G2 finished at the top of the standings after the regular season of the 2021 Spring Split with a 14–4 record, they failed to win in the playoffs, first losing to MAD Lions, and then being eliminated by Rogue in the lower bracket. The team finished in second place in the regular season of the 2021 Summer Split, but lost to MAD Lions in the playoffs once again and were sent to the loser's bracket. There, they faced Rekkles's old team and long-time LEC rival Fnatic, and were defeated, eliminated G2 from contention. As a result, G2 failed to earn one of the LEC's three slots at Worlds, and 2021 marked the first year G2 failed to qualify for Worlds since joining the EU LCS in 2016.\nFor the 2022 LEC season, G2 released Grabbz, Rekkles, Wunder, and Mikyx. Dylan Falco and BrokenBlade were acquired from the disbanding Schalke 04 Esports as the new head coach and top laner. Flakked and Targamas were acquired and promoted from non-LEC European leagues for the bottom lane. G2 finished fourth place in the Spring Split regular season with an 11–7 record and lost to Fnatic in their initial upper bracket playoff match. However, they went on to win out in the lower bracket, defeating Vitality, Misfits, Fnatic (in a rematch), and Rogue in 3–0 matches. This qualified them as the LEC representative at the 2022 Mid-Season Invitational. There, G2 initially performed strongly, sweeping ORDER and Evil Geniuses in the group stage, and getting a strong 4–0 start in the \"rumble\" stage. Including the LEC playoffs, G2 had gone on a 24-game winning streak. The streak was broken with a loss to PSG Talon, however, and G2 finished the rumble stage 5–5. Their record qualified them for the semifinals, but G2 was defeated by the LCK representative T1 in a decisive 3–0 sweep. Following the elimination from the World Championship, Jankos revealed to be parting ways with the G2 Esports organization, ending a 5-year partnership with the team.\nOn 1 September 2022.G2 announced a full female League of Legends teams called G2 Hel.\nG2 revamped its roster again for the 2023 LEC season, G2 signed Yike from LDLC OL and Hans Sama from Team Liquid. Mikyx also returned to G2 from Excel Esports. The team took the tournament from 4th place in the regular season, after which they confidently closed the group stage with a score of 2-0 in Group B. G2 Esports won the 2023 LEC Season Finals with a 3–1 victory over Fnatic, marking their second domestic title of the year after their LEC Winter win. As a result, G2 Esports would represent the EMEA region as the first seed at the 2023 League of Legends World Championship.At worlds G2 started of strong with wins against Dplus KIA and Weibo going 2-0 and requiring one more win to play-offs.However G2 would end up losing against Gen.G, NRG Esports and would then be eliminated by Bilibili Gaming.Despite the loss G2 announced that they wouldn't make any roster changes for the 2024 LEC Season.\n\"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\".\nHistory.\nG2 Esports acquired the roster of Team Kinguin on 11 September 2015.

On October 4, Jones earned his first career OHL point, an assist, in a 5–2 victory over the Oshawa Generals.

On March 30, Jones was involved in an incident in which he would earn a 12-game suspension from the OHL for a blind-side bodycheck on Justin Barack of the Attack. Jones returned from his suspension to play in the third game of the Knights J. Ross Robertson Cup final series against the Niagara IceDogs. Jones helped the Knights clinch the championship, as London swept Niagara in four games, to earn a berth in the 2016 Memorial Cup.\nAt the 2016 Memorial Cup, Jones played in the Knights opening game against the Red Deer Rebels on May 20, however, he was held off the score sheet in a 6–2 win.

However, he scored 17 goals and 36 points, helping London reach the post-season. In the playoffs, Jones scored seven goals and 12 points in 14 games, as London lost to the Erie Otters in the Western Conference final.\nJones began the 2017–18 season with the Knights. On October 20, Jones earned a hat trick in a 5–1 win over the Kitchener Rangers. On December 10, Jones tied his career-high for points in a game, scoring twice and earning two assists in a 6–2 victory over the Erie Otters. On January 7, 2018, the Knights traded Jones to the Kingston Frontenacs in exchange for Sergey Popov, a second-round draft pick in 2023, and a third-round draft pick in 2021. Jones played in 25 games with the Knights, scoring 18 goals and 21 points.\nKingston Frontenacs.\nJones made his debut with the Kingston Frontenacs on January 12, 2018, earning no points in a 4–2 loss to the Guelph Storm but still earning third star in the game. In his next game with Kingston, Jones scored his first goal with the club, beating Cole Ceci of the Oshawa Generals, and added two assists in a 4–1 win over the Oshawa Generals. On January 21, Jones suffered a broken thumb in a game against the Mississauga Steelheads, sidelining him for the remainder of the regular season. In six games with Kingston, Jones had a goal and two assists. In the post-season, Jones missed the first seven games due to his injury, however, he made his playoff debut with Kingston on April 8, earning no points in a 4–2 win over the Barrie Colts. On April 12, Jones scored his first playoff goal for the Frontenacs, scoring the opening goal against Leo Lazarev in a 7–1 win. In nine playoff games with Kingston, Jones scored three goals and four points, as the Frontenacs lost to the Hamilton Bulldogs in the Eastern Conference final.\nProfessional career.\nAnaheim Ducks.\nJones was drafted by the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the first round, 24th overall, of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft held at the First Niagara Center in Buffalo, New York. On August 26, 2016, Jones signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Ducks. Following the elimination of his junior club, the London Knights, in the 2017 OHL playoffs, the Ducks assigned Jones to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the San Diego Gulls for the remainder of the playoffs on April 22, 2017. Jones appeared in his first career AHL playoff game that night, earning no points in a 2–1 win over the Ontario Reign. On May 10, Jones scored his first professional goal against Troy Grosenick of the San Jose Barracuda in a 4–3 overtime loss. In nine post-season games, Jones scored a goal and an assist.\nJones started the 2018–19 season with the San Diego Gulls, and on November 3, 2018, scored his first regular-season AHL goal against the Ontario Reign. On January 16, 2019 he was called up to the NHL. The next night he made his debut, helping the Ducks to a 3–0 win against the Minnesota Wild at Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul. He registered his first NHL point against the Wild on February 19 and scored his first NHL goal on Carey Price in an 8–2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens on March 8. At the end of the NHL season, Jones registered two goals and five points with Anaheim. He was sent back to San Diego in April to help the Gulls in their Calder Cup playoff run, where he scored four points in eight games, missing some time due to injury.\nJones made the Ducks team out of training camp for the 2019–20 season, but split time with the Gulls after being returned to the AHL to develop some more. Jones spent the entire 2020–21 season with the Ducks and registered his first multi-point game, assisting on two of the three goals in a 3–2 overtime win over the St. Louis Blues on March 28, 2021. He finished the season with 11 points in 46 games. He signed a three-year extension with Anaheim on August 10, 2021. After playing the first two games of the 2021–22 season, Jones tore his pectoral muscle and missed the remainder of the season. He returned for the 2022–23 season and the Ducks sought to return him slowly, limiting his playing time by playing him lower down the lineup after Jones had missed the previous season. As the season wore on, his playing time and responsibility was increased, moving up to the first two lines playing with Troy Terry and Mason McTavish.\nInternational play.\nJones was selected for Team USA at the 2018 World Junior Championship. Jones scored his only goal of the tournament in the opening game, a 9–0 win over Denmark. Team USA went on to take the bronze medal in the tournament.\nPersonal life.\nJones' father Brad is a former player who played 148 NHL games with three different teams (Winnipeg Jets, Los Angeles Kings and Philadelphia Flyers)."

        "title": "Albert Stewart (rugby union)",
        "text": "Albert Lewis Stewart, (19 February 1889 – 4 October 1917) was an Irish rugby union player and decorated British Army officer. He played for North of Ireland Football Club from 1907 to 1914, and made three appearances for the Ireland national rugby union team. During World War I, he served in the Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. He was killed in action in the Battle of Broodseinde during the Battle of Passchendaele.\nEarly life.\nStewart was born on 19 February 1889 in Belfast, Ireland, to James and Isabella Stewart. His father was a solicitor. Between 1902 and 1907, he was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, an all-boys grammar school in Belfast.\nSporting career.\nSchool level.\nStewart started playing rugby union while he was still at school. From 1903 to 1907, he played for the first XV of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. He played as a full back in his first year on the team, then switched to playing as a centre for the remaining years. From 1905 to 1907, he also played for Ulster in the schools' inter-provincial competition.\nIn addition to rugby, Stewart played a number of other sports while at school. From 1904 to 1906, he played cricket with his school's first XI. He was both a good batsman and a good fielder. He was also a successful swimmer, specialising in the relay. He was part of the team who won the junior gymnastics competition in 1904, and personally won a number of prizes for sprinting.\nClub level.\nAfter leaving school in 1907, Stewart joined the North of Ireland Football Club (NIFC), a rugby union club based in Belfast. He played centre. In 1909, his team won the Ulster Senior League, and he was awarded the NIFC Honour Cap. He served as Vice-Captain of his club in the 1911/1912 season, and was Captain of his club in the 1913/1914 season.\nRugby international.\nIn February 1913, Stewart was selected to play for the Ireland national rugby union team. He achieved three caps during his international career, and would have achieved more if it wasn't for the outbreak of World War I in 1914. He scored a try in his debut international match.\nHe played in the following matches:\nMilitary service.\nIn September 1914, Stewart applied for a commission in the British Army. He was commissioned into the Royal Irish Rifles as a second lieutenant on 22 September 1914. He was assigned to the 10th Service Battalion (South Belfast Volunteers), Royal Irish Rifles. He then underwent training at Newcastle, County Down. On 23 November 1914, he was made a temporary lieutenant. Next, he was posted to Ballykinlar Camp, Ballykinlar, County Down, as part of the 36th (Ulster) Division. In Spring 1915, he was appointed his battalion's Machine Gun Officer. In May 1915, he and the division moved to Seaford, Sussex, England. From there, they moved to Bramshott Camp, a temporary army camp on Bramshott Common, Hampshire. On 25 August 1915, he was promoted to temporary major.\nStewart spent the first year of his military service, serving within the United Kingdom. On 1 October 1915, he and his battalion departed for France and the Western Front. On 18 December 1915, he was transferred to the Machine Gun Corps in the rank of temporary lieutenant with seniority from 23 November 1914. He was involved in fighting during the winter of 1915/1916.\nOn 1 July 1916, the Battle of the Somme began. Stewart saw action and survived the deadliest day the British Army had ever seen (roughly 60,000 casualties, with 20,000 men killed). On 10 July 1916, he was promoted to temporary captain, and appointed officer commanding the 22nd Machine Gun Company. On 1 January 1917, he was promoted to temporary major.\nDeath.\nStewart was killed in action on 4 October 1917 during the Battle of Broodseinde near Ypres, Belgium. He had been fighting in Glencorse Wood and was trying to seize ground from the Germans when he was killed. He was aged 28.\nStewart was buried in Hooge Crater Cemetery, a Commonwealth War Graves Commission burial ground in Flanders, Belgium.\nPersonal life.\nStewart was a Presbyterian Christian and was a member of the Windsor Presbyterian Church in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\nHonours.\nFor action during the Battle of the Somme, Stewart was recommended for the Victoria Cross (the highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy), but the award was not approved. He was mentioned in despatches twice; in 1916 and in 1917. On 1 January 1918, he was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) \"for distinguished service in the field\"."

        "text": "The 2017 Rugby League World Cup final was a rugby league match to determine the winner of the 2017 Rugby League World Cup, played between reigning champions Australia and their rivals England on 2 December 2017 at Brisbane Stadium in Brisbane, immediately after the final of the concurrent women's competition.\nBackground.\nAustralia became the winners of the Rugby League World Cup for a record eleventh time, beating England 6–0 to retain the Paul Barrière Trophy and become the first team since 1977 to win the World Cup on home soil. \nThis match saw a new equal record low for tries in a Rugby League World Cup final with only one try scored, equaling the one try scored in the 1992 final. It also saw the lowest combined score for a final of 6, which was also previously held by the 1992 final where only 16 points was scored. It was the first time in 22 years since England had played in a World Cup final, when they lost to Australia 8–16 in the 1995 Rugby League World Cup final at Wembley Stadium.\nVenue.\nOn 19 February 2014, it was announced that the joint bid from Australia and New Zealand had won hosting rights for the World Cup and that Brisbane Stadium, commonly known as Lang Park, would host the final.\nThe ground comprises a three-tiered rectangular sporting stadium with a capacity of 52,500 people. and is commonly known as the traditional home of rugby league in Brisbane. The stadium is also used for rugby union and soccer and has a rectangular playing field of .\n2017 was the second time the stadium had hosted the World Cup final, with Brisbane previously hosting the final of the 2008 tournament, in which New Zealand defeated hosts Australia 34–20.\nRoute to the final.\nAustralia.\nAustralia's road to the final began on October 27 at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium in Melbourne, where they played England. After conceding the first try Australia didn't concede for the rest of the match and went on the win 18–4.\nAustralia's next game was in Canberra against France. Australia jumped out to an early 12–0 lead through a Wade Graham double before French fullback Mark Kheirallah fielded an Australian kick and ran 80 meters to score under the posts and make it 12–6. Wade Graham went on to score 4 tries as Australia ran out 52–6 winners. \nThe Kangaroos' final group match was in Sydney against Lebanon. Australia put on a very controlled and professional performance to win comfortably, 34–0.\nAustralia would face the win-less Samoa in the first test match in Darwin to open the quarter-finals. Australian winger Valentine Holmes became the first ever player to score 5 tries in a World Cup match as Australia won 46–0. \nAustralia then moved on to Brisbane to play an undefeated Fiji in the first semi-final. Australian winger Valentine Holmes this time scored 6 tries and broke his own record for the most tries in a World Cup match, and also took his tournament tally to 12 thus becoming the highest tally in a single World Cup. Australia went on to beat Fiji 54–6 and qualified for their 12th World Cup final.\nEngland.\nEngland began their World Cup campaign against Australia on October 27 at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium in Melbourne. England opened the scoring with winger Jermaine McGillvary crossing in the 5th minute, taking an early 4–0 lead. England then conceded two tries to trail 4–10 at half time. The second half was very evenly matched with both teams having chances to score, until a Cameron Smith penalty goal in the 76th minute extended Australia's lead over a converted try, and conceding a 79th minute intercept try to Josh Dugan sealed an England's first defeat of the tournament, going down 4–18. \nEngland's second match of the tournament came against Lebanon in Sydney. A first half blitz saw England take a 22–6 half time lead, with tries to Kallum Watkins, Jermaine McGillvary, Ryan Hall and Ben Currie. A more conservative second half saw England only score and conceded one try, and seal a 29–10 victory with a last minute field goal by Gareth Widdop. Much controversy surrounded an incident in the second half where Lebanon captain Robbie Farah accused England's Jermaine McGillvary of biting during a tackle. McGillvary was not suspended due to no evidence that he bit Farah. \nEngland's final group match came against France in Perth. England got off to a fast start, scoring 3 tries in the first nine minutes, taking a 26–6 half time lead. Much alike their previous group match against Lebanon, England took their foot off the pedal in the second half, only scoring two more tries, going out victorious 36–6 and booking their place in the knockout stage.\nEngland faced the winners of Group C, Papua New Guinea in their quarter final clash in Melbourne. Much a-like their group stage matches, England were the first team to score, taking a 14–0 lead into half time. A Ben Currie try in the 56th minute almost certainly booked England a semi final berth until Garry Lo got PNG's first try and set up an exciting last 20 minutes, until 3 tries in the last 12 minutes saw England run out 36–6 victors. \nEngland then face a passionate Tongan team in the semi-finals in Auckland. England opened the scoring through a try to winger Jermaine McGillvary, scoring his seventh of the tournament. Five minutes later Gareth Widdop took the lead out to 12–0, a lead which England took into half time. A 50th-minute penalty goal took England out past a 2 converted try lead and a 68th minute try to John Bateman all but looked to seal England's first World Cup final berth since 1995, but three tries in 4 minutes to Tonga closed England's lead to two points with 3 minutes left. The ending of the match was very controversial, with Tonga's Andrew Fafita crossing the line in the dying seconds for referee Matt Cecchin to rule a knock-on against the Tongans. Replays showed that the knock-on may have been a result due to a strip from England, but Cecchin failed to review the possible try and thus awarding England a 20–18 semi final win, and advancing to the final to face Australia, who they faced in their opening group match.\nPre-match.\nOfficiating.\nGerard Sutton was named to officiate the match with Chris Kendall from the Rugby Football League and Chris Butler to be the touch judges. Ben Thaler was the video referee, and Matt Cecchin and Robert Hicks were the standy-by referee and touch judges respectively.\nTeam selection.\nSean O'Loughlin was originally selected to play for England but withdrew due to a quad injury. He was replaced by Sam Burgess whilst Ben Currie filled Burgess's spot in the second row, and Jonny Lomax filled Currie's spot on the bench.\nAustralia was unchanged for the final from their semi-final victory over Fiji.\nWomen's final.\nThe match was played as a double-header with the women's final between Australia and New Zealand. Australia won 23–16, retaining their 2013 title and their second overall.\nEntertainment.\nInjured Australian five-eighth Johnathan Thurston and English rugby league icon Kevin Sinfield presented the teams onto the field. Amber Dawn-Finch sang God Save the Queen for the English, and tenor Scott Muller sang Advance Australia Fair for the Australians.\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nBoyd Cordner scored the first try in the 15th minute for Australia, and Cameron Smith converted.\nAfter the first 40 minutes, Australia went into half-time with a 6–0 lead.\nSecond half.\nIn the 47th minute, Michael Morgan appeared to have scored a try, but was ruled no try when referred to the video referee due to ruled interference, resulting in a penalty to England.\nIn the 65th minute, English centre Kallum Watkins broke the Australian line causing an 2-on-1 overlap with Elliott Whitehead unmarked, but was ankle-tapped by Australia's Josh Dugan which ended up being a match-winning moment for the Kangaroos.\nThe second half ended up being a scorless affair for both sides; after 80 minutes Australia retaining the World Cup with a 6–0 victory.\nDetails.\nNotes:\nStatistics.\nAustralia:\nEngland:\nPost-match.\nAustralia won their 11th World Cup final with the victory. Boyd Cordner was named man of the match, and Billy Slater was named player of the tournament.\nAt the subsequent 2017 Rugby League World Cup tournament, held in 2022 and hosted by England, saw the host nation eliminated in the semi-finals to Samoa, whereas Australia qualified for their 12th consecutive World Cup final.\nBroadcasting and viewership.\nIn Australia, 842,000 viewers watched the match on Seven Network. This figure was higher than second test match of the 2017–18 Ashes series, which was on the same evening."

His 61 passes led the NCAA in receptions in 1958. He broke the previous NCAA record of 52 receptions set by Ed Brown in 1952. Hibbert's record was tied in 1959 by Chris Burford of Stanford in 1959 and broken in 1960 by Hugh Campbell of Washington State with 66 receptions.\nLater years.\nIn 1959, Hibbert left the University of Arizona to do missionary work in Brazil for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

        "title": "Match of the Century (rugby union)",
        "text": "The Match of the Century () is the unofficial name of a rugby union Test match played between Wales and New Zealand at Cardiff Arms Park on 16th December 1905 in front of a crowd of 47,000. The game was billed as the \"Match of the Century\" or \"The World Championship\" as it was a first meeting of the top two international teams.\nThe match was part of New Zealand's \"Originals\" tour and was their only loss in 35 matches. The result provoked much debate, with later writers noting its impact on the sporting culture of both countries. The Welsh crowd's singing of \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" as a response to the All Blacks' Haka is often cited as the first national anthem to be sung before an international sports event.\nBackground.\nBy the time the tour arrived in Wales, the All Blacks had not conceded a single point in their last 600 minutes of rugby. They had played 27 matches on the tour so far, scoring 801 points and conceding just 22. They had also won all three of the preceding international matches, two without conceding any points (12–7 against Scotland, 15–0 against Ireland and 15–0 against England).\nWales were also unbeaten that year (defeating England 25–0, Scotland 6–3 and Ireland 10–3 in winning the Home Nations Championship) and had not lost a home international since 1899. As such, many commentators in New Zealand and the UK saw the match as the best chance of stopping an All Blacks clean sweep, and billed the game as the \"\"Match of the Century\" or \"The World Championship Match\"\" long before the tour had begun.\nThe All Blacks played Yorkshire, at Headingley Rugby Stadium on 13 December, winning the game convincingly 40–0. The team travelled to Wales by train on 15 December, arriving at Cardiff station in the evening. Despite the late hour, the visitors received a raucous welcome, a large crowd (contemporary estimates put the crowd at 20,000) had gathered to greet the All Blacks both inside the station and along the neighbouring streets, preventing the players from getting to their hotel, and police had to force a path through the crowd for the tourists.\nWelsh preparations.\nAs early as October, the Welsh Match Committee had been observing the All Blacks tour. On 19 October, the committee travelled to Gloucester and witness the tourists defeating one of the best club sides in England 44–0. It is thought that the scale and manner of this All Blacks victory encouraged the Welsh observers to develop new tactics that could match the tourists' unorthodox style.\nOn 20 November, the first of two trials was held. The \"Probables\" attempted to play the same formation (with seven packed forwards rather than eight) that the New Zealanders had been using throughout the tour. However, the team were beaten 18–9 by a \"Possibles\" team using the traditional Welsh formation. Despite this setback, the selectors persisted with the new formation and won a second trial match 33–11.\nOn 7 December, Dicky Owen took change of another training session where he devised and practiced the move that would result in the match's only try. The final training session was held on 12 December, dedicated to drop kicking and more pertinently, perfecting their new scrum technique.\nAway from the pitch, there were also discussions on a possible response to the Haka. The selector Tom Williams suggested that an appropriately Welsh response to the cultural challenge would be with singing, and that they should sing the Welsh anthem, \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\". Williams' proposal became a matter of national discourse, with the \"Western Mail\" publishing numerous articles encouraging Welsh supporters to join the players once the Haka had been completed. Despite the popularity of the suggestion, there was no official plan for a response, and it remained unclear if the crowd would respond at all.\nMatch Day.\nAlthough Wales had long been considered the toughest test for the All Blacks, many in the London press did not see how Wales could win. This view gained momentum as the All Blacks toured England, beating the best English sides by a growing margin. By the day of the match, many commentators had written off Wales' chances completely.\nFor the All Blacks, the test match was their 28th game in three months. Changes were made to the starting XV, with conflicting post-tour reports suggesting players were rested, injured or ill. Billy Stead was reportedly unable to play due an illness, and was asked to run the line for the match instead. Terry McLean later stated his belief that Stead's illness had a crucial impact on the result, with Stead unable to perform his duties (McLean states he left the side line to find a toilet), he left George Nicholson to run the line in his place. McLean and others felt that had Stead been running the line, he would have been able to get to the Deans incident earlier and confirm his score. G. W. Smith would not play, any part in the match despite being one of the tourists' most celebrated athletes, and seen by many as the All Blacks' most attacking three-quarter of the whole tour.\nIt was known that the match would be a major event and additional trains were laid on for the travelling spectators. Large queues formed before the Arms Park gates were opened at 11am and the large turnout meant that the gates had to be shut again by 1.30pm as the ground was already full. Many of those locked outside of the ground climbed trees or found other vantage points in order to glimpse the match. Taxi drivers parked outside the ground and charged people for the privilege of standing on their cabs to get a view over the stand.\nHaka.\nNew Zealand had performed the Haka before all tour matches but were often met with indifference or hostility. The Haka was better received by Welsh players and the Welsh public; local journalists had sought information from the New Zealand players themselves, with the \"South Wales Echo\" publishing a full transcript and translation of what it called the \"Te Rauparaha Haka\" (Ka Mate). \nAt around 2.20pm, as the Welsh regiment's 2nd Battalion Band played Men of Harlech the All Blacks emerged onto the pitch, with the Welsh following shortly after. However, the band, crowd and the Welsh team were all respectfully silent to accept the challenge of the Haka.\nThe national anthem.\nAs the Haka concluded, Teddy Morgan led an immediate response by singing \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" in the direction of the New Zealanders. Morgan encouraged his teammates to join him and the crowd soon followed, unaccompanied by the regimental band.\nThe singing of \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" is the first recorded instance of a national anthem being sung before an international sporting fixture. At this time national anthems were not associated with sport, especially in Europe. Throughout the British Empire, anthems were associated with the royalty and reserved for formal state occasions.\nWitnesses to this event (including the New Zealand players and London press) all note the impact of the anthem on the players, crowd and themselves. Match reports, player interviews and memoirs all cited the anthem as a factor in the Welsh victory, for decades to come. In Wales, the crowds who had already been singing the anthem at cultural events such as Eisteddfods, would now sing the anthem at rugby matches and other sporting occasions as well. Soon, the singing of national anthems would become a formal part of proceedings in a variety of sports and eventually, a standard practice across the world.\nFirst half.\nHodges kicked off for Wales and the early play was very tough. There were few opportunities until Seeling made a break for New Zealand, this was brought down by the Welsh defence and the first scrum was called.\nThe All Blacks adopted their usual formation of seven packed forwards and would have expected the Welsh to use the British system of eight. However, Wales not only formed their scrum with seven men but they packed with four men in the front row. This meant whichever side New Zealand tried to gain the loose-head advantage, Wales had a man outside. As the front rows engaged, and the attacking side of the scrum became obvious, the surplus Welsh player on the other side would then retreat into the back row.\nWales were the only team with any real scoring chances early on. Percy Bush made a failed attempt at a drop goal, but the best chance ended when an awkward pass from Jack Williams was dropped by Willie Llewellyn yards from the try line.\nAccounts of the match are unanimous in reporting how unusually poor New Zealand were in the first half, and that they conceded an abundance of penalties in the opening fifteen minutes. One reporter stated that the normally free-scoring All Blacks did not get any play inside the Welsh 25 yard line until the very moment before half-time.\nThe Try.\nA scrum was called and Dicky Owen saw a chance to call the move he devised in training. As Wales won the ball, Owen ran it down the blindside, with the backline of Bush, Nicholls &amp; Llewellyn following him in support. This initial move drew Gallaher, Hunter and most of the New Zealand backs in that direction. Owen then switched the play, throwing a long pass back to the openside, with Cliff Pritchard having to take the ball at his feet. The long pass gave Pritchard time to draw the covering tackle of Deans before passing to Gabe who similarly drew Duncan McGregor. Finally Gabe passed to Morgan who sprinted more than twenty metres past the covering full-back Gillett to touch down in the left corner on 23 minutes. Wales failed to kick the conversion and this was the only score of the match and the first time that the All Blacks had conceded without first scoring themselves.\nSecond half.\nThere is general agreement that New Zealand gave a much better account of themselves in the second half, although the Welsh scrum would remain in the ascendancy and poor kicking continued to be an issue for the All blacks. Both teams had scoring opportunities, but the All Blacks had most of the attacking play. Billy Wallace did cross the try line, but was called back having run into touch and a forward pass from Deans prevented an inevitable try for McGregor. The All Blacks also had a series of scrums on the Welsh goal line, but were kept from scoring by a strong Welsh defence. However, the closest opportunity came for the All Blacks when three-quarter Bob Deans was brought down inches from the line.\nDeans incident.\nBilly Wallace gathered the ball from a Welsh kick and ran forward with Bob Deans following him in support. Willie Llewellyn tackled Wallace, but not before he passed the ball inside to Deans who then sprinted thirty yards for the line. All the contemporary reports agreed that both Teddy Morgan and Rhys Gabe brought Deans down at or near the try line (with Morgan later saying that the \"honour\" of making the tackle was Gabe's) but the heavy mist made it unclear to spectators if the tackle had stopped the try.\nThere are conflicting reports on whether the referee, John Dallas was late to the incident. Dallas would always refuted this, stating that he arrived in time to clearly see the incident and estimated that Deans had been 6 to 12 inches short of scoring. Gabe would continually state that Deans was \"inches short\", despite struggling forward after the tackle, Percy Bush also stated that he saw Deans was short and made a double movement (illegal in the game at that time) to try and score the try. \nDeans however, believed a try should have been awarded. Following the match, Deans would send a telegraph to the Daily Mail newspaper in London stating that he had in fact grounded the ball before being pulled back and that the referee had indeed arrived late. Deans would always maintain that he had scored the try, reasserting his belief from his death-bed in 1908. A number of Welsh players, including Teddy Morgan also felt his claim was credible.\nAfter the match.\nAt the final whistle the crowd rushed the field and carried some of the Welsh players on their shoulders. Gallaher would later bring his team into the Welsh changing room to congratulate the winners and the players exchanged jerseys. Despite the controversies that would emerge from the result, Gallaher maintained that \"the best team won\". \nLater discussions and interviews would focus on what was so different about the Wales game. The Welsh anthem, scrummaging tactics, the Deans incident and the fitness of the All Black players have all been named as factors. Both Gallaher &amp; Dixon would later write that the Welsh match was \"one match too far\" and the All Blacks, despite what the score lines prior to the match had suggested, were tired. \nCultural impact.\nOutside of the two competing nations the large crowd, cultural challenges and press coverage would see both nations stereotyped as being \"addicted\" to rugby. In Wales, the victory cemented the sport's place as a central part of modern Welsh culture. However, other authors saw it as a British victory, with Wales' sole win against the All Blacks upholding the honor of both the mother country and the empire as a whole.\nThe Gallaher shirt.\nGallaher exchanged shirts with the opposition captain, Gwyn Nicholls. Nicholls subsequently gifted the shirt to Thomas Mahoney, a van boy at his laundry business, and the shirt remained in Mahoney's family until 2015.\nIn 2015, the shirt was auctioned at Rogers Jones &amp; Co in Cardiff. It had been expected to sell for £20,000 to £40,000, but was secured by a UK-based telephone bid for a record £180,000, more than eight times the previous world record for a rugby shirt. It was later revealed that the winner was Nigel Wray, the financial backer and chairman of Saracens F.C., who outbid five separate attempts to secure the item for New Zealand. The shirt has since been on public display at Twickenham Stadium.\nCentenary celebrations.\nThe centenary of the match was celebrated during the 2005 All Blacks tour of Britain and Ireland. As in 1905, New Zealand were regarded as the best team in the world, and were now officially ranked as such. Wales had also replicated their 1905 position, winning that year's Grand Slam and remaining undefeated throughout the year. The pre-match Haka and anthems were arranged to replicate their order in 1905. \"God Defend New Zealand\" was led by Hayley Westenra before the All Blacks performed the \"Ka Mate\" Haka. The Welsh crowd then directly responded with \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" led by Katherine Jenkins, and \"Cwm Rhondda\", led by Wynne Evans.\nThis time, it was the Welsh who were suffering injuries, missing six of their tourists from that summer's British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand. The match itself was a one-sided affair, with the All Blacks winning 41–3 on their way to claiming a Grand Slam tour."

        "text": "Hanwha Life Esports (HLE) is a South Korean esports organization based in Seoul, owned by Hanwha Life Insurance. It has teams competing in \"League of Legends\" and \"Kart Rider\", with the former competing in the LCK, South Korea's top level professional league for the game.\nIn middle 2018, HLE acquired the League of Legends team and LCK spot of Tigers. At the 2015 \"League of Legends\" World Championship, the team (as KOO Tigers) placed second in their preliminary group before beating KT Rolster and Fnatic in the bracket stage. The team finished as runner-ups after facing SK Telecom T1 in the finals in Berlin, Germany.\nThe team (as ROX Tigers) won their first LCK title after winning the 2016 Summer League of Legends Champions Korea playoffs. At the 2016 \"League of Legends\" World Championship, team finished as third place after lost again to SK Telecom T1 2–3, although led the series 2–1.\nHistory.\nTigers era.\n2014.\nTigers was founded in November 2014 by Chinese social networking site YY. YY's parent company Guongzhou Huaduo Network Technology, LLC. (Duowan Inc.) hoped to promote their newly renamed streaming site, HUYA.com, in South Korea by creating a team built around well-known Korean players. The team was registered under Duowan's Korean subsidiary GE Entertainment.\nThe initial roster, announced under the name HUYA Tigers, included former members of NaJin Sword, NaJin Shield, and Incredible Miracle 1: top laner Smeb, jungler Lee, mid laner KurO, AD carry PraY, and support GorillA comprised the initial lineup, with NoFe as head coach. Shortly after its formation, the team qualified for the \"League of Legends\" Champions Korea Spring Qualifiers, placing first in the group stage over Team Avalanche. They went 2–1 in the final stage and qualified for SBENU Champions Spring 2015. In the Champions Spring pre-season, HUYA Tigers finished tied for third place with KT Rolster, each with 7 points. They renamed to GE Tigers at the start of the Spring Season.\n2015.\nThe GE Tigers started out as the top team in Korea in their first season in the LCK, in first place with a 7–0 match record and a 14–2 game record at the end of week 6 of the Spring season. This placement earned them an invitation to the Intel Extreme Masters Season IX – World Championship in March. However, after defeating Cloud9 and SK Gaming to win their group, they lost in the semifinals 2–1 to Team WE – who entered the competition as the 12th-place team in the Chinese \"League of Legends\" Pro League (LPL). This led many casters and analysts to label it the biggest upset to date in the entire history of competitive \"League of Legends\". After their return to Korea, the GE Tigers' record worsened, and they dropped sets to both KT Rolster and to SK Telecom T1. They still finished first in the round robin with a 12–2 record, but in the playoffs they lost to SKT and missed out on the 2015 Mid-Season Invitational. Prior to the start of SBENU Champions Summer 2015, the GE Tigers were sponsored by streaming company KooTV and changed their name to the KOO Tigers. KOO ended the regular season of Champions Summer in 4th place. They beat NaJin e-mFire 2–1 and CJ Entus 3–0 to advance to the semi-finals where they played a close series with KT Rolster but lost 3–2, ultimately ending in third place. Because SKT won the finals, KOO automatically qualified for the 2015 \"League of Legends\" World Championship as the second seed from Korea with the most circuit points.\nAt the World Championship, KOO Tigers finished 2nd in their group with a 4–2 record and advanced to the bracket round. They defeated KT Rolster 3 to 1 in the quarter-finals. On 24 October 2015 they made a clean sweep, 3 to 0, against Fnatic in the semi-finals. The team finished second after losing with a 1–3 record to SK Telecom T1 in the final on 31 October 2015.\nKooTV dropped their sponsorship of the team in November, reverting the name to just Tigers. In January 2016, the team once again changed their name, this time to ROX Tigers.\n2016.\nIn the LCK Champions spring season, ROX Tigers finished in 1st, and met SKT T1 in the final. ROX Tigers impressed the world with their domination of Korea and their near perfect play in the regular season. Unfortunately, in final the match against SKT T1, ROX Tigers lost 3–1 finishing the LCK playoffs in 2nd place.\nHowever, ROX Tigers have the honor of boasting the highest team KDA in this season.\nTop laner Smeb was named MVP of the spring split and summer split.\nHLE era.\n2018.\nIn middle 2018, Hanwha Life Insurance acquired the League of Legends team rosters and LCK spot of ROX Tigers. The team also was renamed to \"Hanwha Life Esports\" (HLE). They had finished at 6th place of regular summer season and couldn't qualify for Play-off stage."

It has teams competing in \"Call of Duty\", \"\", \"Fortnite\", \"Overwatch\", \"Super Smash Bros.\", \"Rocket League\", \"iRacing\" and \"Valorant\". The organization previously had a \"League of Legends\" team that qualified for the 2016 North American League of Legends Championship Series (LCS), but it was sold to Team EnVyUs after the owners were banned from NA LCS ownership.\nIn September 2016, professional basketball player Jonas Jerebko purchased the rights to the Renegades franchise.\nCurrent divisions.\n\"Call of Duty\".\nOn August 30, 2016, Renegades signed the former members of Dream Team known as Ground Zero. KiLLa, Chino, Sender and Diabolic had already qualified for the 2016 Call of Duty World League Championship by earning enough CWL Championship Points from Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the CWL. At the event, the team lost their first two matches in Group D to Epsilon eSports and Team Allegiance and then forfeited their match against PuLse Gaming after KiLLa didn't show up for the series. Renegades finished 25th-32nd. KiLLa was dropped less than a week later and was replaced by Ivy the following day.\n\"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\".\nRenegades acquired the Australian CS:GO team Vox Eminor on June 19, 2015. Renegades were the first team announced to be participating in the ELeague. After placing second at IEM Taipei 2016, Renegades announced that Karlo \"USTILO\" Pivac would be replacing Luke \"Havoc\" Paton in their starting roster. On June 17, 2016, Chad \"SPUNJ\" Burchill announced his retirement from competitive Counter-Strike. Ricky \"Rickeh\" Mulholland was announced as SPUNJ's replacement on July 12, 2016. Following Rickeh's departure to Counter Logic Gaming, Renegades first added Nemanja \"nexa\" Isaković to their roster for a brief four-month stint, before releasing him. As their new fifth, they acquired David \"Jayzwalkingz\" Kempner on a trial-basis from Fnatic's academy team, before releasing him after a month. On September 1, 2017, Keith \"NAF\" Markovic was added as the fifth player from OpTic Gaming. He transferred to Team Liquid on February 5, 2018 and was replaced by Joakim \"jkaem\" Myrbostad three days later, as a long-term stand-in. After some time of rumoring it was confirmed on October 31, 2019, that the then-current Renegades team, containing AZR, jks, Gratisfaction, jkaem, Liazz and kassad is being transferred to 100 Thieves.\nIn December 2019, Renegades signed the roster of Grayhound Gaming, which consisted of Chris \"dexter\" Nong, Oliver \"DickStacy\" Tierney, Liam \"malta\" Schembri, Simon \"Sico\" Williams, and Joshua \"INS\" Potter. On January 8, 2020, DickStacy departed from the squad, and Jordan \"Hatz\" Bajic was brought in as his replacement three days later. On February 11, 2021, Christopher \"dexter\" Nong left the team to join mousesports. Following Nong's departure, Alistair \"aliStair\" Johnston joined from ORDER, with IGL duties going to Joshua \"INS\" Potter. On June 30, 2020, David \"Kingfisher\" Kingsford joined as the team's head coach.\nThey recently placed first at the Oceanian IEM fall 2021 tournament, thus securing enough RMR points to qualify themselves to compete in the 2021 Stockholm Major, the first in 2 years.\nOn June 3rd, 2022 Renegades announced that they would be dropping their CSGO team, with Australian team ORDER picking up the roster\n\"Rocket League\".\nRenegade first entered the Rocket League scene in July 2017, picking up the former Selfless Gaming roster after the owners decided to step away from the organization. Their first season in the RLCS saw Renegades go 1–6 in League Play, finishing last in the North American region and placing them in the promotion/relegation tournament. However, the team was able to keep their spot in the top division after defeating both Fibeon eSports and Out of Style in the tournament. Before the start of Season 5, the team decided not to re-sign with the org. Renegades would sit out the next couple seasons of RLCS, returning to the scene halfway through Season 7 by acquiring the former Chiefs Esports roster.\n\"Super Smash Bros.\".\nRenegades expanded into the Super Smash Bros. series on October 6, 2016.\nFormer divisions.\n\"Gigantic\".\nRenegades acquired the Gigantic roster known as Team ApeX on November 9, 2015.\n\"Halo\".\nRenegades acquired the team \"Leftovers\" on January 18, 2016. Following the Halo World Championship, Spartan and StelluR left Renegades for Team Liquid.\n\"League of Legends\".\n2015.\nRenegades was initially announced as an unnamed Challenger team in early March 2015 by Chris Badawi. The team's first roster included mid laner Alex Ich and jungler Crumbzz, along with support Remilia from solo queue. After tryouts for the remaining two positions, top laner RF Legendary and AD carry Intense joined the team, and they named themselves Misfits. In April, Misfits participated in the AlphaDraft Challenger League (ADCL) and dropped only a single game during the regular season round robin, finishing 11–1 in first place. After the ADCL regular season ended, Intense left the team. Stixxay joined as a substitute AD carry and played with the team for the bracket stage of the ADCL, and they won the tournament, beating Frank Fang Gaming in the finals.\nMisfits played under the name The Expendables6 on the Challenger Ladder and were in third place at the cut-off date for NA Challenger Series (NACS) Summer Qualifier participation. Danish AD Carry Jebus joined as the team's final permanent member, replacing Stixxay, but his first appearance was delayed due to visa issues. In the NACS Qualifier, Misfits played against Also Known As, Team Liquid Academy, and Magnetic, using two different substitute AD carries — Maplestreet against Also Known As and Magnetic, and Nien against Team Liquid Academy. Misfits swept their competition with three consecutive 2-0 victories and qualified for the Summer Season. The team shortly thereafter renamed to Renegades, with caster and former coach Chris \"MonteCristo\" Mykles joining as the team's co-owner.\nPrior to the start of the Challenger Series, Riot Games published a competitive ruling regarding team owner Chris Badawi claiming that he had inappropriately attempted to persuade otherwise contracted players to join the team (then Misfits), including Team Liquid's Quas and Keith. The ruling stated that if Renegades were to qualify for the LCS, Badawi would have to drop his ownership stake in the team. Multiple parties reacted to the ruling, including MonteCristo and Badawi himself, who both protested the fairness of the ruling; and team owners and managers Steve \"LiQuiD112\" Arhancet of Team Liquid, Reginald of Team SoloMid, and Jack Etienne of Cloud9, who spoke out in support of it. Ultimately Badawi was banned from participating with the team in an official capacity and was forced to divulge his ownership stake in the team if they qualified for the LCS.\nRenegades finished the Challenger Series regular season with an 8–2 record and in second place, after losing a tiebreaker to Team Coast. However, in the playoffs, they defeated Imagine 2–1 and then Coast 3–2, earning a berth in the 2016 NA LCS Spring Season.

The team consisted of Erik \"Tabzz\" van Helvert, Matthew \"Impaler\" Taylor, Marc \"Caedrel\" Lamont, Barney \"Alphari\" Morris, and Aleksi \"Hiiva\" Kaikkonen, with subs Marcin \"Xaxus\" Maczka and Divit \"DxAlchemist\" Bui.\nIn April 2016, the team was at the center of an ownership and management controversy, which resulted in the team being banned from the NA LCS and owners Chris Badawi and Christopher \"MonteCristo\" Mykles selling the team to NBA player Jonas Jerebko. Following the transfer, the team was rebranded as Detroit Renegades.\nRenegades' \"League of Legends\" roster was disbanded on May 8, 2016, after they allegedly \"violated the competitive ban against Chris Badawi, misrepresented their relationship with TDK, and compromised player welfare and safety\". The roster was sold eventually to Team EnVyUs on May 18, 2016."

It marked the culmination of the 2019 Rugby World Cup and was played between England and South Africa, a rematch of the 2007 Rugby World Cup final.\nThe match saw South Africa claim their third Rugby World Cup title with a 32–12 victory, with tries from Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe adding to six penalties and two conversions from Handré Pollard. The official player of the match was South Africa's number eight, Duane Vermeulen.\nThe match was the United Kingdom's most watched TV broadcast in 2019 with a peak audience of 12.8 million watching on ITV.\nRoute to the final.\nEngland's final pool match with France was called off on safety grounds due to the impact caused by Typhoon Hagibis; according to tournament rules, the result was declared a 0–0 draw.\nEngland.\nEngland reached the final after topping their pool with bonus point wins against Tonga, the United States and Argentina. Their final group match against France was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis and was recorded as a scoreless draw. In the quarter-finals, England played Australia at Oita Stadium, Ōita. England won 40–16 thanks to two tries from Jonny May and one each from Kyle Sinckler and Anthony Watson, all converted by Owen Farrell, who also added four penalties. In the semi-final at Yokohama Stadium, England played the reigning champions New Zealand. England beat the All Blacks 19–7, breaking New Zealand's 18-match winning streak at World Cups, with a try from Manu Tuilagi converted by Farrell, and four penalties from George Ford. This was England's fourth appearance in a World Cup final, having last been world champions in 2003. They had also reached the final in 1991, when they lost to Australia, and 2007, losing to South Africa. Prior to the final, England called up Saracens scrum-half Ben Spencer as a late replacement for Willi Heinz who had suffered a hamstring injury during the semi-final against New Zealand. England named an unchanged starting team for the final.\nSouth Africa.\nSouth Africa's World Cup campaign began with a loss to New Zealand in their opening match in the pool, but they followed it up with bonus-point wins over Namibia, Canada and Italy to progress in second place in Pool B. In the quarter-finals, they played the hosts Japan, winning 26–3 through two tries from Makazole Mapimpi and one from Faf de Klerk, with one conversion and three penalties from Handré Pollard. In the semi-final, they played Wales and won 19–16 due to a converted try from Damian de Allende and four penalties from Pollard, including the match-winner in the 76th minute. This was South Africa's third appearance in the World Cup final, following victories over New Zealand on home soil in 1995 and England in France in 2007. South Africa made only one change for the final with Cheslin Kolbe replacing S'busiso Nkosi on the right wing.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nEngland started as favourites for the final, but they had an unfortunate start to the game as Kyle Sinckler was substituted in the third minute after colliding with Maro Itoje, leaving England with only one tighthead prop. South Africa tight forwards Bongi Mbonambi and Lood de Jager also left the field with injuries in the 21st minute. In the first half, the only points scored were from penalties, with South Africa leading 12–6 at half-time after several handling errors by England, who came close to scoring a try, but did not manage to score after 26 phases.\nTwo more successful penalties for each side made the score 18–12 early in the second half. Makazole Mapimpi scored the first try in the 66th minute, when he ran in on the left before touching down, making South Africa's lead 25–12 after the conversion. Despite South Africa having won two previous World Cups, he was the first Springbok to score a try in a World Cup final. Cheslin Kolbe followed up with another try eight minutes later, running in from the right wing to make the final score 32–12.\nDetails.\nNotes:"

        "text": "The 2015 Breeders' Cup World Championships was the 32nd edition of the thoroughbred horse racing season-ending premier event held on October 30 and 31 at Keeneland in Lexington, Kentucky. The race series, held for the first time at Keeneland, required a significant amount of preparation to transform the small, historic track into a venue capable of handling large crowds, comprising 13 championship races held over a two-day period.\nThe highlight of the series was the victory of American Pharoah in the Breeders' Cup Classic, becoming the first horse in history to complete the Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing, the three Triple Crown races plus the Classic. In the process he set a track record before a record crowd for the Keeneland facility.\nBreeders' Cup Challenge series.\nThe Breeders' Cup Challenge is a series of races that provide the winners of designated races with automatic \"Win and You're In\" berths in a specified division of the Breeders' Cup. For qualifying horses, the Breeders' Cup organization covers the entry fee and provides a travel allowance of up to $40,000 for the connections of horses from overseas. Thirty-nine horses entered in the Breeders' Cup races qualified via the challenge series, including six of the winners. These were:\nEvent preparation.\nIn 2014, the management of Keeneland began to replace the synthetic Polytrack racing surface of its main race track with dirt. While the synthetic surface, installed in 2006, was considered safer for horses, it also was not popular with horse owners because it was too different from the dirt tracks where many major races were held. Returning the track to a dirt surface was a significant factor in Keeneland's bid to host the Breeders' Cup in 2015. The Keeneland bid was successful and was officially announced on June 24, 2014.\n2015 was the first year that the Breeders' Cup had ever been held at Keeneland. A track built in 1935 as \"a model race track, to perpetuate racing in the proper manner\", it had never handled crowds of the size anticipated for the Breeders' Cup and thousands of temporary seats had to be added without removing trees or otherwise changing the classic appearance of the facility. But with a facility, there was room to be flexibile. Track management decided to only offer 28,000 reserved seats and further required that all tickets for both reserved and general admission be purchased in advance. They created seating in buildings adjacent to the existing grandstands and set up large tents and other temporary facilities, plus two tailgate areas with big-screen televisions for additional spectators. Keeneland's organizers estimated they would be able to host about 45,000 people.\nThe configuration of the Keeneland racetrack is unique compared to previous Breeders' Cup venues, requiring some races to be held at different distances than previous Breeders' Cups. The dirt track is a oval with two possible finish lines, and the turf course is furlongs () with a homestretch that is one of the longest in the United States. The use of the alternate finish line on the dirt course for the Dirt Mile, Juvenile, and Juvenile Fillies raised the possibility of confusing the jockeys, and the long turf stretch was viewed as giving a heavy advantage to closers.\nThe Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile had an unorthodox setup because Keeneland does not regularly hold 1–mile dirt races. To get the proper distance while maximizing the run-up to the first turn, the starting gate was set in front of the one-mile pole, where the timer would start, and the finishing line was set at the track's alternate finish line at the mile pole, thus the race was slightly longer than a mile for the horses. Keeneland held four races at that distance in the 2015 Fall meet to test the configuration.\nThe Filly &amp; Mare Turf was conducted at miles because the track's turf course configuration does not allow for the usual distance of mile.\nAlso due to the configuration of the turf course, the Turf Sprint was held at furlongs for the first time the history of the race, which had been run since 2008. Previously, the race was about furlongs when held on the \"downhill turf course\" at Santa Anita Racetrack and 5 furlongs when held at Churchill Downs.\nResults.\nThe attendance at the 2015 Breeders' Cup set a record for the Keeneland race course. Over two days, total attendance was 95,102. Attendance on Friday, October 30, at 44,947, was the highest for a Friday since the Breeders' Cup became a two-day event in 2007. It also broke Keeneland's previous one-day record of 40,617, set in 2012. The attendance on Saturday was 50,155. While the total attendance figure over two days was not a Breeders' Cup record, the Keeneland facility received high marks for its facilities.\nWhile the total parimutuel wagering handle was comparable to other years, at $150,574,656, the figures for bets at the Keeneland track itself were higher than the handle in the previous year when the Breeders' Cup was at Santa Anita Racetrack. Wagering on all races Friday, including the six non-Breeders' Cup races held earlier in the day was $44,949,165 total, 1.9% lower than in 2014, but with $7,550,279 of that bet at Keeneland, which was an 8% increase for betting on-site.\nEach day's program included several undercard stakes races. Friday had 10 races total, four of which were Breeders' Cup championships. The most-anticipated race on Friday was the Breeders' Cup Distaff for fillies and mares, won by the four-year-old campaigner, Stopchargingmaria. Saturday hosted 12 races, nine of which were part of the Breeders' Cup program, including the Breeders' Cup Turf, which drew the British-bred Epsom Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Golden Horn and the much-anticipated Breeders' Cup Classic, where American Pharoah would challenge older horses for the first time in his career. For both horses, their contests would be the last time each would race before being retired to stud. Golden Horn struggled with the sand-based turf course and was second to the Irish filly Found. American Pharoah, coming off of a defeat in his previous race and a two-month layoff, led wire-to-wire in the Classic and won by lengths, becoming the first horse to win the Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing, consisting of the Triple Crown plus the Classic. With his win, he also broke the Keeneland track record for the distance."

He played college basketball for the University of Memphis and the University of Virginia.\nEarly years.\nNichols attended Briarcrest Christian School in Eads, Tennessee. While there, he was a four-time letterwinner and helped lead his team to the state championship game. Nichols averaged 22.7 points, 12.2 rebounds and 2.6 blocked shots his senior season en route to being named the Gatorade Player of the Year for Tennessee. On November 5, 2012, Nichols committed to the University of Memphis.

Nichols was named AAC Rookie of the Year at the end of the season.\nDuring his sophomore year, Nichols would be limited to just 27 games because of several ankle injuries. Despite the injuries, he led the Tigers in scoring (13.3 PPG), was second on the team in rebounds (6.1 RPG), and third in the country in blocked shots (3.4 BPG). At the conclusion of the season, it was announced that Nichols had earned a spot on the All-AAC First Team, becoming the first Tigers player to do so since the reorganization of the American.\nThe summer following his sophomore season, Nichols requested to be released from his scholarship. The Memphis staff initially refused to let Nichols leave, but eventually granted him a conditional release. The conditions would apply if Nichols transfers to the University of Tennessee, any school in the American Athletic Conference, and any out-of-conference schools that play Memphis during the 2015–16 and 2016-17 seasons. Transferring to one of these schools meant that he would have to pay for his redshirt season before becoming scholarship eligible again once reinstated. The Nichols family hired a lawyer to petition for an unconditional release, and on July 14, 2015, Memphis removed all conditions from Nichols' release.\nVirginia.\nOn July 28, 2015, Nichols announced that he was transferring to the University of Virginia. He had also received interest from Notre Dame and Marquette. After sitting out the 2015-16 season as a redshirt, Nichols was scheduled to have two years of eligibility remaining once reinstated.\nAfter being suspended for the opener, Nichols appeared in one game. He was then dismissed from the team on November 18, 2016.\nPersonal life.\nAustin's parents are Mark and Kim Nichols. He has a twin sister named Ashley and an older sister Natalie. Nichols was majoring in drama."

        "text": "Swimming competitions have been held at the Pacific Games since the inaugural edition in 1963 at every Games except for 1983. Swimming has also been held once at the South Pacific Mini Games, in 2005.\nNotes.\n The number of events does not include an unofficial 3 × 110 yd medley relay for women swum at the 1963 Games. Fiji and PNG finished first and second respectively but medals were not awarded.\n There were either 24 or 23 events on the 1979 programme, depending on whether the men's 4 × 200 metres relay was contested and officially included in the medals. There are conflicting sources of information cited (as of November 2015) and none sufficient to provide clarity. The men's 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay was not listed in the results published in the November 1979 issue of \"Pacific Islands Monthly\" (PIM). However, there are sources which suggest that the PIM published results might have some inaccuracies and could be incomplete:\n Despite swimming being a compulsory sport for the South Pacific Games, there was no facility built in Apia to host swimming events for the 1983 Games.\n There were either 34 or 33 events on the 1999 programme, depending on whether the women's 4 × 200 metres relay was officially included in the medals. The medal list published on the Oceania Sport Information Centre (OSIC) website as of October 2015, omits the women's 4 × 200 m freestyle relay. However, the result sheet for the event records New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Northern Marianas as finishing first, second and third, respectively.\n Two mixed gender relay events were added to the schedule."

        "text": "Test cricket is the oldest form of cricket played at international level. A Test match is scheduled to take place over a period of five days, and is played by teams representing Full Member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Pakistan obtained Full Member status of the ICC in 1952, becoming the seventh nation eligible to play Test cricket. The Pakistan national cricket team played their first Test match on 16 October 1952 against India which they lost by an innings and 70 runs. They recorded their first victory in their second ever match against India on 23 October 1952. Since then, they have played 434 matches, against every other Test-playing nation. , Pakistan is the fourth-most successful team in Test cricket with an overall winning percentage of 32.87, behind Australia (47.39), South Africa (38.46) and England (36.39).\nTop order batsman and former captain Younis Khan holds several Pakistan batting records. He has scored the most runs (10,099) for Pakistan in Test cricket – the first and only player to score over 10,000 runs in the format for his country. He is the record holder for the highest number of centuries (34) as well as the highest number of double centuries (six with Javed Miandad) for Pakistan. Hanif Mohammad's 337 runs against the West Indies in 1958 is the highest individual score by a Pakistani cricketer, surpassing the previous best of 209 by Imtiaz Ahmed, which was established in 1955. It is also the eighth-highest individual score in Test cricket. Hanif Mohammad (337), Inzamam-ul-Haq (329), Younis Khan (313) and Azhar Ali (302 not out) are the only Pakistani players who have scored triple centuries.\nWasim Akram, regarded as \"one of the greatest left-arm bowlers in the history of world cricket\", holds several Test records. He holds the record for the most Test wickets (414) as well as the record for the most five wickets per innings (25) for Pakistan. Akram also holds the record of highest individual score batting at number 8 (257 not out) in Test cricket. This feat was achieved in 1996 playing against Zimbabwe. Abdul Qadir's nine wickets for 56 runs, against England at Gaddafi Stadium in 1987, is the best bowling figures in an innings by a Pakistani bowler. 14 wickets for 116 runs by Imran Khan against Sri Lanka in 1982 at the same ground is the best bowling performance in a Test by a Pakistani player. He also holds the record for best bowling average for Pakistan with 22.81. Younis Khan took 139 catches from 118 matches as fielder, the most by a Pakistani and twelfth-highest overall. Wasim Bari is Pakistan's most successful wicket-keeper having taken 228 dismissals; he is eleventh in the list of most dismissals in Test cricket.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except in \"team wins, losses, and draws\" and \"highest wicket partnerships\". Tied records for the fifth place are listed as well. Explanations of the general symbols and cricketing terms used in the list are given below. Specific details are provided in each category where appropriate.\nTeam records.\nTeam wins, losses, and draws.\nPakistan has played 454 Test matches resulting in 147 victories, 140 defeats and 166 draws for an overall winning percentage of 32.38, the fourth-highest winning percentage of Test playing teams.

Only two matches have ended in a tie in Test cricket history, neither of which involved Pakistan.\nTeam scoring records.\nMost runs in an innings.\nThe highest innings total scored in Test cricket came in the series between Sri Lanka and India in August 1997. Playing in the first Test at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, the hosts posted a first innings total of 952/6d. This broke the longstanding record of 903/7d which England set against Australia in the final Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The Oval. The first Test of the 2008–09 series against Sri Lanka saw Pakistan set their highest innings total of 765/5d, the fifth-highest score in Test cricket.\nHighest successful run chases.\nPakistan's highest fourth innings total is 450 all out in an unsuccessful run chase against Australia at Brisbane in December 2016.

If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nGreatest win margins (by innings).\nThe fifth Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The Oval saw England win by an innings and 579 runs, the largest victory by an innings in Test cricket history.

Their first-narrowest win by wickets came in the first Test of the Australia tour of Pakistan in 1994–95. Played at the National Stadium in Karachi, the hosts won the match by a margin of one wicket. Pakistan repeated the feat against Bangladesh at Multan Cricket Stadium in 2003.\nGreatest loss margins (by innings).\nLord's in London played host Pakistan's greatest defeat by an innings in Test cricket. The final Test of the 2010 series saw England defeat the tourists by an innings and 225 runs, to win the series 2–0.\nGreatest loss margins (by runs).\nThe first Test of the 2004–05 series saw Pakistan defeated by Australia by 491 runs, fourth greatest losing margin by runs in Test cricket.\nGreatest loss margins (by 10 wickets).\nPakistan have lost a Test match by a margin of 10 wickets on nine occasions.\nNarrowest loss margins (by wickets).\nTest cricket has seen fifteen matches been decided by a margin of one wicket, with Pakistan being defeated twice, both coming against West Indies.

During the fourth Test of the 1956 Ashes series, Laker took 9/37 in the first innings and 10/53 in the second to finish with match figures of 19/90. Imran Khan's figures of 14/119, taken in final match of the 1981–82 Test series against Sri Lanka, is the sixteenth-best in Test cricket history.\nBest career average.\nA bowler's bowling average is the total number of runs they have conceded divided by the number of wickets they have taken.\nNineteenth century English medium pacer George Lohmann holds the record for the best career average in Test cricket with 10.75. J. J. Ferris, one of fourteen cricketers to play Test cricket for more than one team, is second behind Lohmann with an overall career average of 12.70 runs per wicket.

In 1912, Australian Jimmy Matthews achieved the feat twice in one game against South Africa. The only other players to achieve two hat-tricks are Australia's Hugh Trumble, against England in 1902 and 1904, Pakistan's Wasim Akram, in separate games against Sri Lanka in 1999, and England's Stuart Broad.\nWicket-keeping records.\nThe wicket-keeper is a specialist fielder who stands behind the stumps being guarded by the batsman on strike and is the only member of the fielding side permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards.\nMost career dismissals.\nA wicket-keeper can be credited with the dismissal of batsman in two ways, caught or stumped. A fair catch is a taken when the ball is caught fully within the field of play without it bouncing when the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat, while a stumping occurs when the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket while the batsman out of his ground and not attempting a run.\nPakistan's Wasim Bari is eleventh in taking most dismissals in Test cricket as a designated wicket-keeper with 228.\nMost career catches.\nBari leads in the list of most catches taken as a designated wicket-keeper in Test cricket for Pakistan, with 201.\nMost career stumpings.\nBert Oldfield, Australia's fifth-most capped wicket-keeper, holds the record for most stumpings in Test cricket with 52. He is followed by England's Godfrey Evans with 46 to his name. Indian glovemen Syed Kirmani and MS Dhoni are both equal third on 38 and Bari is eighth in the list with 27.\nMost dismissals in an innings.\nFour wicket-keepers have taken seven wickets in a single innings in a Test match—Wasim Bari of Pakistan in 1979, Englishman Bob Taylor in 1980, New Zealand's Ian Smith in 1991 and most recently West Indian gloveman Ridley Jacobs against Australia in 2000.\nThe feat of taking 6 wickets in an innings has been achieved by 22 wicket-keepers on 30 occasions including two Pakistanis.\nMost dismissals in a match.\nThree wicket-keepers have made 11 dismissals in a Test match, Englishman Jack Russell in 1995, South African AB de Villiers in 2013 and most recently India's Rishabh Pant against Australia in 2018.\nThe feat of making 10 dismissals in a match has been achieved by 4 wicket-keepers on 4 occasions with Sarfaraz Ahmed being the only Pakistani wicket-keeper.\nMost dismissals in a series.\nBrad Haddin holds the Test cricket record for the most dismissals taken by a wicket-keeper in a series. He took 29 catches during the 2013 Ashes series which broke the previous record held by fellow Australian Rod Marsh where he took 28 catches in the 1982–83 Ashes series. Rashid Latif has the most dismissals for Pakistan in a Test series.\nFielding records.\nMost career catches.\nCaught is one of the ten methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket. A fair catch is defined as a fielder catches the ball, from a legal delivery, fully within the field of play without it bouncing when the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat. The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen.\nIndia's Rahul Dravid holds the record for the most catches in Test cricket by a non-wicket-keeper with 210, followed by Mahela Jayawardene of Sri Lanka on 205 and South African Jacques Kallis with 200. Younis Khan is the highest-ranked Pakistani and twelfth overall, securing 139 catches in his Test career.\nMost catches in a series.\nThe 1920–21 Ashes series, in which Australia whitewashed England 5–0 for the first time, saw the record set for the most catches taken by non-wicket-keeper in a Test series. Australian all-rounder Jack Gregory took 15 catches in the series as well as 23 wickets. Greg Chappell, a fellow Australian all-rounder, is second behind Gregory with 14 catches taken during the 1974–75 Ashes series. Three players have taken 13 catches in a series on five occasions with both Bob Simpson and Brian Lara having done so twice and Rahul Dravid once. Younis Khan has taken 10 catches, the most by a Pakistani.\nAll-round records.\n1000 runs and 100 wickets.\nA total of 71 players have achieved the double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in their Test career.\nOther records.\nMost career matches.\nIndia's Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the most Test matches played with 200 with former captains in Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh being joint second with each having represented Australia on 168 occasions. Javed Miandad played for Pakistan in 124 matches.\nMost consecutive career matches.\nFormer English captain Alastair Cook holds the record for the most consecutive Test matches played with 159. He broke Allan Border's long standing record of 153 matches in June 2018. Asad Shafiq, the Pakistan batsmen has played in 72 consecutive Test matches.\nMost matches as captain.\nGraeme Smith, who led the South African cricket team from 2003 to 2014, holds the record for the most matches played as captain in Test cricket with 109. Allan Border, the man who skippered Australia from 1984 to 1994 is second with 93 matches. New Zealand's captain from 1997 to 2006, Stephen Fleming, is third on the list with 80 and in fourth on 77 is Australia's Ricky Ponting who led the side for six years from 2004 to 2010. Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq is ninth in the list along with Sri Lankan Arjuna Ranatunga.\nYoungest players.\nThe youngest player to play in a Test match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 227 days. Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 24 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time. The second- and third-youngest players are also from Pakistan—Mushtaq Mohammad and Aaqib Javed at 15 years and 124 days and 16 years and 189 days, respectively.\nOldest players on debut.\nAt 49 years and 119 days, James Southerton of England, playing in the very first Test match in March 1877, is the oldest player to make his debut in Test cricket. Second on the list is Miran Bakhsh of Pakistan who at 47 years and 284 days made his debut against India in 1955. Australia's Don Blackie is the third-oldest player to make his debut, breaking into the side during the second Test of the 1928–29 Ashes series at the age of 46 years and 253 days.\nOldest players.\nEngland all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes is the oldest player to appear in a Test match. Playing in the fourth Test against the West Indies in 1930 at Sabina Park, in Kingston, Jamaica, he was aged 52 years and 165 days on the final day's play. The oldest Pakistani Test player is Miran Bakhsh who was aged 47 years and 298 days when he represented Pakistan for the final time in the 1955 tour of India at the Peshawar Club Ground.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsman are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsman and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to tenth wicket partnership. When the eleventh wicket has fallen, there is no more batsman left so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest Test partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the Sri Lankan pairing of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene who put together a third wicket partnership of 624 runs during the first Test against South Africa in July 2006. This broke the record of 576 runs set by their compatriots Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanama against India in 1997. New Zealand's Andrew Jones and Martin Crowe hold the third-highest Test partnership with 467 made in 1991 against Sri Lanka. Equal fourth on the list is Mudassar Nazar and Javed Miandad of Pakistan who together scored 451 against Pakistan in 1983 and the Australian pairing of Bill Ponsford and Don Bradman putting on the same score against England in the 1934 Ashes series.\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the laws of cricket. Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nAleem Dar of Pakistan holds the record for the most Test matches umpired with 136. The current active Dar set the record in December 2019 overtaking Steve Bucknor from the West Indies mark of 128 matches. They are followed by South Africa's Rudi Koertzen who officiated in 108."

He has since become an ABL champion, a two-time PBA All-Star, and a member of Gilas Pilipinas.\nIn college, Wright helped lead the St. Bonaventure Bonnies to an Atlantic 10 championship and into the 2012 NCAA tournament. In his senior season, he led the team in scoring.\nAfter college, Wright started his professional career in France. He then went to play for the Westports Malaysia Dragons, with whom he won an ABL championship with. He then spent six seasons with the Phoenix Fuel Masters before joining Kyoto Hannaryz in 2022.\nEarly life.\nWright was born on February 7, 1991, in Toronto to Chris Wright and Ofelia Wright (née Agustin). He grew up there with his parents, grandmother, and some relatives. The Filipino community in Toronto exposed him to basketball, which he started learning at 10 years old. Vince Carter and Kobe Bryant were also his influences growing up. While attending Bloorlea Middle School, he was selected as their Athlete of the Year.\nHigh school career.\nWright played for the Scadding Court AAU basketball program in his teen years. He also played at the Martingrove Collegiate Institute, leading them in scoring with 21 points a game. He did consider committing to the La Salle Green Archers in the Philippines before his final year of high school, but decided to remain in Toronto so that he could be recruited by a Division 1 program. In his senior year, he averaged 23 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists and 2 blocks per game. He also led them to their second consecutive Toronto District School Board Triple-A championship.\nWright had offers from Maine, Duquesne, and Santa Clara University. However, the NCAA questioned whether he had accepted money to play for the Philippines men's national under-18 team. While he waited for the NCAA to clear him, other schools lost interest in him and he considered playing for the University of Toronto. During this time, he made an unofficial campus visit to St. Bonaventure, who then helped him become eligible as the rumors of him accepting money were proven to be false. He then committed to play for the St. Bonaventure Bonnies in 2010.\nCollege career.\nIn Wright's first season, he started off poorly, shooting one-for-21 from three point range. He bounced back by scoring 18 points against the George Washington Colonials and followed up that performance with 15 points in a win over Duquesne. The team started relying on him more to provide off the bench scoring. He finished his rookie season as his team's leader in three point shooting (.426), second in steals (.8), fourth in assists (1.6), and fifth in scoring (6.9). \nIn his sophomore season, Wright was promoted to the starting lineup after one of the senior guards got hurt. During that season, he hit a game-winning three pointer from the corner off a pass from teammate Andrew Nicholson against the St. Joseph's Hawks. Behind Nicholson, the Bonnies won the Atlantic 10 championship that year. They also made it to the 2012 NCAA tournament, where they lost to the Florida State Seminoles. He finished the season as the team's leader in assists and steals while averaging 6.8 points and 2.5 rebounds.\nIn his junior season, Wright had 22 points on eight-of-eleven shooting including four-of-four behind the arc when the Bonnies beat the Temple Owls. He followed that with an 18-point night in SBU's triumph over the Hawks. He also struggled through a torn plantar fascia during this time. Still, he was able to average 7.3 points per game and finished in the top 10 in three point shooting in the A10. \nIn his senior season, Wright had a college career-high 27 points on 10 of 14 shooting in a win against Canisius, which gave the Bonnies a 3–0 start to their season. The Bonnies then started A10 play with him scoring 20 points in a win over the Richmond Spiders. He then had 18 points against Fordham, then had 24 points against George Mason, which were both wins. He also got a cut below his right eye that required two stitches after the game. For those performances, he was named Atlantic 10 Co-Player of the Week along with Richmond guard Kendall Anthony. He then had 22 points on 8 of 15 shooting including 5 of 8 behind the arc in a win against the St. Louis Billikens. For that season, he led St. Bonaventure in scoring with 16.3 points per game. Aside from finishing in the top 10 for scoring in the Atlantic 10 conference, he also finished in the top 10 for assists, three-pointers made, minutes played, and free throw percentage (which he led the entire conference). He graduated with a degree in history.\nProfessional career.\nUJAP Quimper 29 (2014–2015).\nAfter Wright graduated, he applied for the 2014 NBA draft, where he went undrafted. For a while, he was working in a warehouse in Rexdale. He then was able to sign a professional contract to play for the French club Quimper. This made him the 15th St. Bonaventure men's basketball alumnus to sign a professional contract since Mark Schmidt became the Bonnies’ head coach in 2007. He made his debut in a 91–87 loss to Cognac on October 25, 2014. He did not score but he dished out three assists in 14 minutes of action. However, he time there did not last long as he did not have a good relationship with the head coach there.\nWestports Malaysia Dragons (2015–2016).\nBefore the start of the 2015–16 ABL season, the Westports Malaysia Dragons signed Wright and Jason Brickman to be their ASEAN Imports. On November 7, 2015, Wright recorded 30 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists and 6 3-pointers made in a 100–92 win over the Saigon Heat. That season, Wright was named as the ASEAN Heritage MVP after he helped lead the Dragons to the finals of the ASEAN Basketball League on his maiden season with an average of 23.1 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game. The Dragons were able to claim their first ABL championship in franchise history in five games. He scored 461 points that season, the most by a non-World Import in a single season and also owned the record for most three-pointers made in a single game with 10.\nMighty Sports (2016).\nOn September 16, 2016, it was reported that he was going to be part of the Mighty Sports lineup for the 2016 Merlion Cup. In the team's second game on the group stages, he scored 20 points against the Westports Malaysia Dragons to help the team get a semifinals berth. Mighty Sports eventually lost to the Shanghai Sharks in the finals of the 2016 Merlion Cup after Jimmer Fredette was fouled in the final possession taking a triple who then drained the 3 free throws.\nPhoenix Fuel Masters (2016–2022).\n2016–17 season: Rookie season.\nCoach Chot Reyes committed all the players of the Gilas pool to the PBA draft, including Wright. With him being a member of Gilas, he didn't need to play in the PBA D-League for two conferences, which was a requirement for other Fil-foreigners. He reunited with Ariel Vanguardia who was his coach when he played for the Westports Malaysia Dragons, after he was selected by the Phoenix Fuel Masters as their Gilas draft selection in the 2016 PBA draft. On November 8, 2016, he signed a 3-year, P8.5M rookie max deal with Phoenix.\nDue to food poisoning, he missed the team's first game of the 2016-17 PBA Philippine Cup where they lost 94–87 to Blackwater Elite. In his PBA debut, he scored 14 points to help his team have an upset win against the San Miguel Beermen. Against the Meralco Bolts, he had 22 points, including crucial free throws, that sealed the win for Phoenix. He then had a near triple-double of 12 points, 12 rebounds, and 9 assists in a win over the NLEX Road Warriors. He then followed it up by scoring 18 points in the second half to take a win against Barangay Ginebra. For those performances, he was given his first Player of the Week award. In his first All-Star Game, he received co-MVP honors along with Troy Rosario of the opposing side. That week, he also competed in his first three-point contest and won another All-Star Game MVP. He scored 27 points in a rematch with Ginebra in the Commissioner's Cup, taking the win over them. But they failed to qualify for the playoffs, as they lost to NLEX despite him scoring a career-high 42 points, the most by a rookie since Eric Menk in 1999. In the 2017 Governors' Cup, he struggled, as Phoenix failed to win games. He had 36 points against the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters, but they still got their eighth straight loss, a franchise-worst. He finished the season on the All-Rookie Team with 16.5 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 3.7 assists.\n2017–18 season.\nAfter starting the 2017–18 Philippine Cup with a loss, Phoenix went on to win two straight, with Wright scoring 13 of his 19 points against NLEX for that second straight win. On his 27th birthday, he scored a game-high 16 points, 5 rebounds, and made the game-winning assist to Doug Kramer against the TNT Katropa. He scored 32 points against the Globalport Batang Pier to secure the final spot in the playoffs for Phoenix. But they were eliminated by the Katropa. This loss gave him more rest after spending time between Phoenix and national team duties. In the Commissioner's Cup, he finished off a comeback from down sixteen against the Philippine Cup finalists Magnolia Hotshots by making a step-back three with 3.2 seconds remaining. He finished the game with 19 points on 7-of-14 shooting. In a double-overtime win over Ginebra, he made back-to-back scores in the second overtime that sealed the win for Phoenix. He finished that game with 19 points, 10 rebounds, three assists, one steal, and no turnovers in 44 minutes. During the 2018 All-Star Week, he once again played in the All-Star Game and competed in the three-point contest. In an overtime game against the Bolts, he had 28 points and six assists, but missed a jumper that could have won the game for them in overtime. In a win against Globalport, he had 24 points on six threes, but received a technical foul after retaliating from a hit to his head from opposing import Malcolm White. In the Governors' Cup, they finished with a franchise-best record of 8–3 record, gaining a twice-to-beat advantage and second-place finish in the standings. He had 23 points in their last win. But they lost in the first round to the seventh-seeded Bolts. He finished the season third in the league in scoring with 17.6 points per game.\n2019 season.\nBefore the start of the 2019 PBA season, Wright was awarded a three-year contract extension. He was also awarded a spot on the Second Mythical Team for the previous season. In a Philippine Cup match versus the Katropa, he scored 23 points (with seven coming in the overtime period) to lead the Fuel Masters to their second straight overtime win. He had 25 points in a win over the Beermen that secured the top seed for the Fuel Masters. They then beat the Alaska Aces to advance to the semifinals for the first time in franchise history. In the semifinals, they lost their first two games to the Beermen, as their playoff inexperience started to show. But in Game 3, he hit four crucial free throws despite battling bronchitis to give Phoenix the win. However, he received a flagrant foul for hitting Beermen guard Von Pessumal. The Beermen went on to win the next two games, eliminating the Fuel Masters from the playoffs. In the Commissioner's Cup, Phoenix had three straight losses with Coach Louie Alas and Calvin Abueva suspended. They also lost import Rob Dozier to a foot injury. He scored 28 points to lead Phoenix to a win over NorthPort and stop their win streak. In a comeback win against Ginebra, he combined with replacement import Richard Howell for 27 points in the third quarter. He finished that game with 32 points, while Howell had 31 points and 21 rebounds. More importantly, it was their second straight win. For those performances, he won a unanimous Player of the Week award. In the Governors' Cup, he had a foot injury during a team practice. Despite the injury, he was able to play in Phoenix's final game, in which he hit a tough corner three with 1.2 seconds remaining to beat Blackwater. He dedicated the game-winner to retiring veterans Kramer and Willy Wilson.\n2020 season: Bubble season.\nOn September 17, the PBA Board of Governors have approved a plan to restart the season on October 11 (originally on October 9), then was given a provisional approval by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) on September 24. All games were played in the \"PBA bubble\" in Angeles City, the isolation zone specifically created for league operations. Before the start of the season, interim coach Topex Robinson was made permanent head coach.\nIn the first game of the 2020 Philippine Cup, he scored 36 points in a win over the Bolts. He dedicated that performance to his late childhood idol Kobe Bryant and to coach Robinson. He then followed up that with 23 points, seven rebounds, and nine assists in a win over NorthPort. In a loss to TNT, he made all 13 of his free throw attempts and finished the game with 31 points. This was the most free throws made without missing since LA Tenorio also went 13-of-13 in 2017. Against Magnolia, he scored 23 points to help Phoenix overcome a 23-point deficit. In the return of Abueva after a 16-month ban against NLEX, he scored 28 points. He continued his high-scoring with 33 points in a win against the Terrafirma Dyip. He cooled down with just 10 points against SMB, but RJ Jazul's career-high of 33 points gave Phoenix the win. He also had 10 assists. At the end of the elimination round, he emerged as a leading MVP candidate, leading the league in statistical points and leading Phoenix to the 2nd seed.\nThey beat Magnolia in the quarterfinals, as he hit a game-winning three point shot off the bench. However, in Game 1 of the semifinals against TNT, he injured his ankle. He decided to play through the pain, as he played limited minutes in Game 2. In Game 3, he had 23 points, including a turnaround jumper that sealed the win and moved them one more win closer to the Finals. But TNT won the next two games, with TNT guard Bobby Ray Parks Jr. scoring 36 and 26 points on them, eliminating Phoenix from finals contention. At the end of the season, he was awarded a spot on the PBA's Elite Five. He also finished second in Best Player of the Conference voting, losing it to Barangay Ginebra's Stanley Pringle.\n2021 season.\nWright scored 20 points in a loss to the Hotshots, now having Abueva, who had been acquired by them in the offseason before the 2021 Philippine Cup. He missed a game due to a sprained ankle, but Phoenix still won that game with Vic Manuel stepping up with 26 points and 12 rebounds. Following a league-imposed break, he and Manuel led the league in scoring, but had only one win to four losses up to that point. They got their second win against Rain or Shine when Wright made his only field goal of the game in the last 2.6 seconds of the game to put them up for good. He did contribute 12 rebounds and five assists. In the end, they were eliminated from playoff contention when they lost to Ginebra. In the Governors' Cup, he got another Player of the Week award after scoring 23 points in a Christmas Day win over NLEX. It was also during this time that he got offers to play in the Japanese B-League. For the period of February 11–13, he earned another Player of the Week award after scoring 27 points,10 assists, and the game-winning steal in a win over TNT. They secured the last spot for the playoffs with a win over NorthPort. At the end of the elimination round, he was no. 2 in statistical points, putting him in the running for Best Player of the Conference. Phoenix was eliminated in a blowout loss by Magnolia, in which he fouled out. He also admitted frustration with Phoenix losing key players to trades and free agency. He was made a member of the Second Mythical Team with averages of 16.3 points, 5.8 rebounds, and career-high averages of 6.4 assists and 1.6 steals.\n2022–23 season.\nWright began talks on contract negotiations with Phoenix, keeping his options open on playing overseas. They failed however, to reach an agreement before the start of the season. Phoenix also tried trading him, but no takers were found. With the contract set to expire at the end of the 2022 Philippine Cup, he decided to play out the contract and set aside negotiations as not to distract the team. He began his season with 20 points in a loss to SMB. In Phoenix's penultimate game of the conference, he had 15 points, eight rebounds, and four assists to lead them in a rout over the Converge FiberXers. It was revealed that he had to leave for the US to marry his wife, and would not finish the conference. He mentioned that it could possibly be his last game with the team, as both him and Phoenix failed to reach a compromise in contract negotiations. He also mentioned that playing overseas or returning to the PBA with a different teams were options he was considering. In Phoenix's final game of the conference, they lost to Ginebra without him.\nKyoto Hannaryz (2022–present).\nOn August 31, 2022, Wright announced that he had officially parted ways with Phoenix. On September 2, Kyoto Hannaryz of the Japanese B.League announced that they had signed him to a two-year deal (with the second year a team option). The contract came with perks and a clause that would allow him to play for the national team. The move reunited him with head coach Roy Rana, who was a rival head coach back when he was still in high school.\nWright went scoreless in his B.League debut against the Sendai 89ers, but recorded four assists and three rebounds. Despite a back injury, he played in their rematch the following day, contributing five points as the team bounced back with the win. He then missed back-to-back games against the Nagoya Flying Eagles. He returned with 10 points, but his team still lost to SeaHorses Mikawa. In the rematch, the team snapped their three-game losing streak, with him contributing eight points and four assists. Against Niigata Albirex, he had his best game yet with 16 points, five rebounds and three assists. He got to play in the Asia Rising Star game during the B.League's All-Star Weekend. In the first game after All-Star Weekend, he had 13 points and seven rebounds in a win over the Osaka Evessa. Against the Hiroshima Dragonflies, he scored a season-high 26 points and eight assists, but lost and slid to a 16–24 record. They did not make the playoffs after a record of 22–38.\nOn May 18, 2023, Wright signed a multi-year contract extension with the team. In a loss to the Yokohama B-Corsairs, he had a double-double of 19 points and 10 rebounds, both team-highs. In a matchup against fellow Filipino import Thirdy Ravena and the San-En NeoPhoenix, he scored a B.League career-high 31 points with seven triples, but lost to Ravena. Against the Utsunomiya Brex, he scored 19 points, four assists, three steals, and made the game-winning step-back three pointer. On January 6, 2024, Wright became the 5th Filipino to score 1,000 B.League career points. He reached that milestone in his 80th game, making him the fastest Filipino to reach that milestone. Once again, he got to play in the Asia Rising Star Game. In his first game after All-Star Weekend, he scored 24 points in a win over the Nagasaki Velca. Against the Saga Ballooners, he scored a B.League career-high 37 points and also made eight triples (with his last one the game-winning three pointer). Aside from his point total being the most in his B.League career, it was the most he had scored since scoring 42 back when he was a PBA rookie, and the most scored by a Filipino import in Japan. His eight three-pointers were the most he had made in his entire career.\nNational team career.\nJunior national team.\nWright was part of the Philippines men's national under-18 team coached by Franz Pumaren that competed in the four-nation Nokia Manila Youth Basketball Invitational 2008 and 2008 FIBA Asia Under-18 Championship. He was convinced by fellow Fil-Canadian Norbert Torres to join the team.\nSenior national team.\nIn 2016, he was included in the pool of the Philippine men's senior national team where the members of the Philippine squad that participated at the 2016 FIBA Asia Challenge was derived from.\nThe following year, Wright was on the team for the 2017 SEABA Championship, and he won a gold medal. He was also on the roster for that year's FIBA Asia Cup, and scored 25 points in a win over Qatar to clinch the top spot in Group B. However, Gilas only finished in seventh place after making back-to-back second-place finishes. He contributed 12 points (including a perfect 7-of-7 from the free throw line) in a win over Japan for the 2019 FIBA World Cup qualifiers.\nIn 2018, he was involved in the Philippines–Australia basketball brawl, as he was among nine Filipino players ejected from the game. As a result, him and Japeth Aguilar had to serve a one-game suspension, which was the least punishment among players involved. They were able to make their return in a qualifying game against Qatar.\nFor the final World Cup qualifiers in 2019, Wright was not included in the lineup. Still, Gilas qualified for the World Cup with a win over Kazakhstan. He returned to the Gilas pool for the World Cup, but experienced pains in his ankle. His ankle got better, but in the end, he was one of the final cuts from the final roster for the World Cup. He was able to win a gold medal in the 2019 SEA Games.\nWright begged off from the Gilas Pilipinas pool for the first window of the Fiba Asia Cup qualifiers due to rehab for an ankle injury. In 2022, he returned to Gilas for the 2021 SEA Games. Unlike last time, Gilas was denied its gold medal by Indonesia in the finals.\nPersonal life.\nAs of 2017, he is involved in a long-distance relationship with Gabriela Moscoso. They have two sons, Preston and Roman. They married on July 24, 2022.\nCareer statistics.\nPBA.\n\"As of the end of 2022–23 season\""

Unfortunately, they went on to lose to the Taipei Assassins 0–3 in the finals, achieving another second place record in the playoffs.\nWhile they were unable to become the champions of 2014 GPL Summer, their dominating performance in the 2014 Garena Regional Finals (where they emerged as the number-one seed in the Taiwan and SEA region by beating the Saigon Fantastic Five in the finals) allowed them to participate in the 2014 Season World Championship.\nSeeded into Group A of the 2014 Season World Championship in Taiwan, the team played against EDward Gaming, Samsung White and Dark Passage. AHQ's 3–3 record qualified them for a tiebreaker into the bracket, where they lost to EDward Gaming.\n2015.\nAfter a disappointing run in the 2014 Season World Championship, AHQ acquired Mountain and OhReaL from Logitech Snipers, Ziv from HK Attitude Mage, and MrAlbis from Logitech G Fighter. Naz and GarnetDevil left, while Prydz became the analyst.\nThe new roster qualified for IEM Season IX - Taipei in IEM Season IX, where they won 2–0 against the Logitech Snipers, 2–0 against Hong Kong Esports, and 2–1 against the Yoe Flash Wolves in the winner's bracket finals. At IEM Season IX - Taipei, AHQ would receive a quarterfinal bye for winning the winner's bracket finals, but would then be defeated 0–2 against the Yoe Flash Wolves.\nSeason 5 marked the start of the League of Legends Masters Series, a new league exclusive to teams from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. AHQ was invited to its qualifiers, where they went 3–0 in their group to earn a berth in the regular season. They finished fourth in the round robin, with a 13–8 record, but went on to win the playoffs with 3-0 victories over Hong Kong Esports and the Taipei Assassins, followed by a 3-1 finals victory over the Flash Wolves.\nBecause of their spring split-victory, AHQ were invited to play at the 2015 Mid-Season Invitational. Finishing 3–2 in the group stage, AHQ advanced to the bracket, but were knocked out immediately by eventual tournament winners EDG.\nAHQ went on to sweep their way through the Summer Season, with a win-tie-loss record of 11-3-0. Placed directly into the finals of the gauntlet-style playoffs, they once again won the season, this time beating Hong Kong Esports 3-0 and automatically qualifying for the 2015 Season World Championship.\nAt Worlds, AHQ were seeded into Group B, along with Fnatic, Invictus Gaming, and Cloud9. They went 3-3, advancing to the playoffs after a tiebreaker victory over Cloud9 (giving the North American team their fourth loss in a row that day). Their World Championship run ended in the quarterfinals, where they lost against tournament favorites SK Telecom, earning a top eight finish.\nAHQ Korea.\nAHQ created a South Korean \"League of Legends\" sister team on 15 February 2013. The team was allegedly created specifically to throw games, which ultimately led to player Cheon \"Promise\" Min-Ki attempting suicide after making an online post detailing the team's match-fixing."

        "title": "Major League Baseball tie-breaking procedures (1995–2011)",
        "text": "Because inclusion in the Major League Baseball postseason is based upon the teams' regular-season records, procedures exist to break ties between teams.\nThis page described tie-breaking procedures in effect from 1995 through 2011. For current procedures, see Major League Baseball tie-breaking procedures.\nTies between two teams.\nTwo-way tie for the division or wildcard.\nOne game tie-breakers are played between teams tied for a division championship or wild-card berth on the day after the season was scheduled to end.\nTwo teams that are tied for a division championship play a tie-breaker if said game would eliminate the loser from the playoffs entirely. This was the case in 2009 when the Minnesota Twins and the Detroit Tigers were tied at the end of the regular season for the American League Central division title. Since the 2009 season, home advantage has been determined by comparing the teams involved in the tie by a set of performance criteria, with the first tiebreaker being head-to-head record. Accordingly, the first one-game playoff under the new rules, the AL Central playoff between the Minnesota Twins and Detroit Tigers, was hosted by the Twins, who won the scheduled season series 11–7. The Twins won that game and advanced to the Division Series, where they were swept by the eventual World Series winners, the New York Yankees.\nTwo teams that are tied for the wild-card berth (such that both teams have a worse record than their division champion, whether in the same division or not), always play a tiebreaker game. Home-field advantage in this scenario is given according to tie-breakers outlined in the next section.\nPrior to 2009, home-field advantage in the game was determined by a series of coin tosses that occurred a few weeks before the end of the season between teams that were close enough to each other in the standings where a tie becomes a significant possibility. If new situations occurred (i.e. a team quickly rises in the standings making another tie possible) more coin tosses occurred. Contrary to what some believe, home-field advantage was not determined by head-to-head record in the regular season until . For example, in 1995, the Seattle Mariners and California Angels played a one-game playoff to determine the AL West championship. The Mariners hosted (and won) the one game playoff but lost the season series 5–7 in games (excluding the one game playoff).\nIf postseason berths are not in dispute.\nNo game is played if both teams are guaranteed to go to the playoffs. This happened in 2001 Major League Baseball season when the Houston Astros (9–7 against STL) and St. Louis Cardinals (7–9 against HOU) tied for first in the National League Central with records of 93–69. In 2005, the New York Yankees (10–9 against BOS) and Boston Red Sox (9–10 against NYY) each finished 95–67 in the American League East. In 2006, the Los Angeles Dodgers (5–13 against SD) and the San Diego Padres (13–5 against LAD) were tied for the National League West division title and the Wild Card at 88–74. In this case, the rules below are used to determine the division winner.\nTwo-way intradivision tie-breaker, with both teams already guaranteed a playoff spot with one as the division champion and the other as a wildcard. The division title is awarded in the following priority:\nThe loser of this tie-breaker goes to the playoffs as the wild card team.\nTies between two division winners.\nIf two champions from separate divisions have the same record, a tiebreaker is needed to determine seeding. With the current set-up of Major League Baseball divisions, there are three possible scenarios.\nTies between three teams.\nThree-way tie for the division or wildcard.\nIf the three teams have identical records against each other in the regular season, the office of the commissioner conducts a draw with the teams designated as teams A, B, and C. First, Team A hosts Team B. The following day, the winner of that game plays and hosts Team C. The winner of the game on the second day advances to the playoffs. The team designations are determined as follows:\n\"Mixed\" three-way tie.\nThe situation may arise that two teams from the same division are tied for the division championship, but they are also tied with another team from a different division, with that team not having the best record in their division, but having a better record than all of the other non-division winners.\nIn this case the two teams in the same division play a one-game playoff, with the winner declared the division champion. The next day, the loser of the first game, and the other team from the other division play each other, with the winner declared the wild card.\nThree-way ties between division winners.\nIf there is a three-way tie among all division champions, the team with the best record against both of the other division champion is given the top seed with the remaining teams seeded as follows:\nIf neither team has a better record against the other teams, immediately go to above tiebreaker.\nTies between four teams.\nThe four teams draw lots, as teams A, B, C, and D. On the first day, Team B plays at Team A, and Team D plays at Team C. The next day, the winners of these games play each other at the ballpark of the winner between Team A and B."

        "title": "Major League Baseball tie-breaking procedures",
        "text": "Major League Baseball tie-breaking procedures are used by Major League Baseball (MLB) to break ties between teams for qualification and seeding into the MLB postseason. The procedures in use since , when a third wild card team and resulting Wild Card Series were added for both the American League and National League, are outlined below.\nTies between two teams.\nTwo-way tie for the division or wild-card.\nOne-game tiebreakers were played between teams tied for a division championship or a league's second wild-card berth. These games were played the day after the season was scheduled to end. Home-field advantage was determined using the rules listed below (\"Breaking Ties Without Playoff Games\").\nFrom the implementation of the wild-card in 1994 to the end of the 2011 season, a different rule was in place. Two teams tied for a division did not play a tiebreaker if their records were better than all non-division winners in their league. Instead, said tie was broken using the rules listed below (\"Breaking Ties Without Playoff Games\"). This happened in 2001 Major League Baseball season when the Houston Astros (9–7 against STL) and St. Louis Cardinals (7–9 against HOU) tied for first in the National League Central with records of 93–69. In 2005, the New York Yankees (10–9 against BOS) and Boston Red Sox (9–10 against NYY) each finished 95–67 in the American League East. In 2006, the Los Angeles Dodgers (5–13 against SD) and the San Diego Padres (13–5 against LAD) were tied for the National League West and the National League Wild Card at 88–74. In this case, the rules below are used to determine the division winner. The team that had the better head-to-head record (the 2001 Astros, 2005 Yankees, and 2006 Padres) was the division champion, thus receiving a better seed in the postseason. The other team (the 2001 Cardinals, 2005 Red Sox, and 2006 Dodgers) was seeded as the wild card.\nFrom 2012 to 2021, when the Wild Card Game was established as a second wild-card berth in each league, the non-division winner with the best record in the league faced possible elimination on the first day of the postseason. Consequently, the tie-breaking rules were changed so that two teams tied for a division championship had to play a tiebreaking game even if both teams had already qualified for the postseason. The team losing the tie-breaking game qualified for a wild-card berth only if its regular-season record was among the league's two best records for non-division-winners. If that team were tied for the second wild-card spot, a second tie-breaking game would have been played.\nIf, on the other hand, two teams had been tied for the first wild-card spot, no tie-breaking game would have been played. Rather, the two teams simply played against each other in the Wild Card game, with home-field advantage awarded using tie-breaking rules described in the next section.\nBeginning with the 2022 season, a third wild-card berth per league was adopted (with the Wild Card Game becoming a Wild Card Series). Thus, the tiebreaker game format was eliminated, to compensate for the expanded (12-team) postseason.\nBreaking ties without playoff games.\nCoin tosses or drawing of lots will be used if all criteria below fail. \nTies between two division winners.\nIf two champions from separate divisions have the same record, the tiebreaking procedure listed above is used to determine postseason seeding. No additional games are played.\nTies among multiple teams.\nPlayoff games for multiple-way ties.\nTied teams are designated as A, B, C, and D. Choice for one of these designations is first given to the team winning the tie-breakers (listed below). While A is usually the \"best\" designation, there are some scenarios where C has a different path to the postseason. If a division title is up for grabs, then those divisional teams will select from the first designations (A, B...).\nOn Day 1, A will host B and C will host D (if there is no fourth team, C will be considered to have won this game). Games on Day 2 may occur as follows:\nDetermining team designations.\nThe order in which teams pick their designations (A, B, C, D) will be determined by the following 5-step tie-breaking system. If there is a tie for both wild card and division title spots, then the first designations will match teams competing for their division title.\nIf at any given step some, but not all, teams remain tied, then those teams that are still tied revert to Step 1.\nBeginning in 2022, the rules are changed using 5 step tiebreaking procedure for multi-way ties without using team designation: If three teams DO NOT all have identical records against one another, and Team X has a better record against all other teams, then Team X is the qualifier. If two or more teams have identical records against one another and each has a better record against the third or fourth team(s), then these two teams follow the two-club tiebreaker rules to determine the qualifier. Otherwise, they are ranked by their overall winning percentage against one another, and the club with the highest overall winning percentage is the qualifier. If two of the clubs have identical winning percentages in this scenario, then they would follow the two-club tiebreaker procedure.\nIf all teams DO have identical records against one another, then the team with the best intradivision record and intraconference (see below) is the qualifier.\nNote: Division tiebreakers must be settled first in any scenario. Also, if at any given step some, but not all, teams remain tied, then those teams that are still tied revert to Step 1."

        "title": "List of South Africa One Day International cricket records",
        "text": "One Day International (ODI) cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) as well as the top four Associate members. Unlike Test matches, ODIs consist of one inning per team, having a limit in the number of overs, currently 50 overs per innings – although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs. ODI cricket is List-A cricket, so statistics and records set in ODI matches also count toward List-A records. The earliest match recognised as an ODI was played between England and Australia in January 1971; since when there have been over 4,000 ODIs played by 28 teams. \nThis is a list of South Africa Cricket team's One Day International records. It is based on the List of One Day International cricket records but concentrates solely on records dealing with the South African cricket team.

South Africa has a positive win ratio against every cricket team in the ODI format.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, draws and ties, all round records and the partnership records. Tied records for fifth place are also included. Explanations of the general symbols and cricketing terms used in the list are given below. Specific details are provided in each category where appropriate. All records include matches played for South Africa only, and are correct .\nTeam records.\nWinning every match in a series.\nIn a bilateral series winning all matches is referred to as whitewash.

Jacques Kallis is the most experienced South Africa players having represented the team on 328 occasions.\nMost consecutive career matches.\nTendulkar also holds the record for the most consecutive ODI matches played with 185. He broke Richie Richardson's long-standing record of 132 matches.\nMost matches as captain.\nRicky Ponting, who led the Australian cricket team from 2002 to 2012, holds the record for the most matches played as captain in ODIs with 230 (including 1 as captain of ICC World XI team).

Graeme Smith has led South Africa in 149 matches, the most for any player from his country.\nYoungest players on Debut.\nThe youngest player to play in an ODI match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 233 days. Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 30 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time. The youngest Indian to play ODIs was Sachin Tendulkar who at the age of 16 years and 238 days debuted in the second ODI of the series against Pakistan in December 1989.\nOldest players on Debut.\nThe Netherlands batsman Nolan Clarke is the oldest player to appear in an ODI match. Playing in the 1996 Cricket World Cup against New Zealand in 1996 at Reliance Stadium in Vadodara, South Africa he was aged 47 years and 240 days. Clive Rice is the oldest South African ODI debutant when he played the South Africa's inaugural ODI during 1991 tour of India at the Eden Gardens, Kolkata.\nOldest players.\nThe Netherlands batsmen Nolan Clarke is the oldest player to appear in an ODI match. Playing in the 1996 Cricket World Cup against South Africa in 1996 at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi, Pakistan he was aged 47 years and 257 days.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second-wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third-wicket partnership then commences between the not-out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest ODI partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the West Indian pairing of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels who put together a second-wicket partnership of 372 runs during the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe in February 2015. This broke the record of 331 runs set by the Indian pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid against New Zealand in 1999\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nRudi Koertzen of South Africa holds the record for the most ODI matches umpired with 209. The current active Aleem Dar is currently at 208 matches. They are followed by New Zealand's Billy Bowden who officiated in 200 matches."

        "title": "2016 Rugby Championship",
        "text": "The 2016 Rugby Championship was the fifth edition of the annual southern hemisphere Rugby Championship, featuring Argentina, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. The competition is operated by SANZAAR, a joint venture of the four countries' national unions. New Zealand won their first four matches with bonus points to gain an unassailable lead, winning the title for the fourth time.\nThe tournament started on 20 August after the 2016 Summer Olympics had concluded, with Australia hosting New Zealand and South Africa hosting Argentina. The tournament ran for eight weeks with two bye weeks, ending on 8 October, when South Africa faced New Zealand and Argentina played Australia at Twickenham Stadium in London.\nBackground.\nThe tournament was operated by SANZAAR and known for sponsorship reasons as \"The Castle Rugby Championship\" in South Africa, \"The Investec Rugby Championship\" in New Zealand, \"The Castrol Edge Rugby Championship\" in Australia and \"The Personal Rugby Championship\" in Argentina.\nThe 2016 Championship returned to a 6-round format, with each team playing the other home and away. The previous year it had been reduced to 3 rounds so that the 2015 Rugby World Cup could be accommodated. It was the first tournament for which Argentina was a full member of SANZAAR, and the first in which they had a team competing in the SANZAAR-run Super Rugby competition.\nFor the first time a match was played in a neutral venue. Argentina's home match against Australia on 8 October was held at Twickenham Stadium in London.\nAustralia were the holders of the title, having won the 2015 edition.\nOverview.\nIn June there was a break from the 2016 Super rugby tournament while the four Southern Hemisphere national teams played test matches against touring Northern Hemisphere nations. New Zealand won all three tests against Wales, Australia were whitewashed by England in their three tests (the first time they had lost a series against England in Australia), Argentina's series against France ended in one win each and Ireland won their first match in South Africa before losing the next two and the series. These results and their 11-match winning streak leading into the tournament made New Zealand firm favourites to secure their fourth Rugby Championship title since it expanded to include Argentina five years ago.\nThe opening match was played between New Zealand and Australia at Stadium Australia in Sydney. New Zealand comprehensively beat Australia 42–8, scoring six tries to one. In the first half Ryan Crotty, Jerome Kaino, Waisake Naholo and man of the match Beauden Barrett scored tries for New Zealand, while Australia only managed a solitary penalty through Bernard Foley. Australia's cause was not helped as they lost three backs (Matt Giteau, Rob Horne and Matt To'omua) to injury. After the break New Zealand scored two more tries with Dane Coles and Julian Savea dotting down, while Nick Phipps scored a consolation try for Australia at the end. South Africa narrowly beat Argentina 30–23 at Mbombela Stadium, scoring a try in the final minutes to take the lead. South Africa took an early lead after Ruan Combrinck scored a try in the corner, but Argentina struck back though a try of their own to Matías Orlando to take a 13–10 lead into the half-time break. Late in the second half Argentina looked to have won the game when Santiago Cordero collected a Nicolás Sánchez chip to give Argentina a 10-point lead with 11 minutes remaining. However, South Africa leveled after a Johan Goosen try and an Elton Jantjies penalty, before Warren Whiteley sealed the win with two minutes remaining.\nThe second round featured the same teams playing their return matches. New Zealand kept Australia try-less, winning 29–9 and retaining the Bledisloe Cup for the 13th straight year. Despite Israel Dagg scoring two tries, Australia put in a better defensive effort and New Zealand only led 15–9 at the half time break. Julian Savea and Sam Cane scored a try each in the second half while keeping Australia scoreless. Argentina reversed the result against South Africa in Salta, kicking a last minute penalty to secure a 26–24 victory. Argentina outplayed South Africa in the first half, scoring one try to fullback Joaquin Tuculet, to lead 13–3. South Africa struck back in the second half with veteran winger Bryan Habana scoring a record 65th test try. Juan Leguizamon scored a second try for Argentina and they led by seven with 13 minutes remaining. South Africa took the lead for the first time in the match with six minutes left when Pieter-Steph du Toit scored a try and then Morne Steyn landed a penalty. Argentina were able to defended strongly to prevent South Africa scoring any more points, before Gonzalez Iglesias landed a match winning penalty in the 77th minute.\nAfter a week's break Argentina traveled to New Zealand and following a competitive first half dropped away to lose 57–22. Argentina took the lead after only two minutes as Cordero scored under the posts from the opening passage of play. However, New Zealand struck straight back with a Julian Savea try. Ben Smith and Barrett also scored for New Zealand while Sanchez's four penalties kept Argentina close, with New Zealand leading 24–19 at half time. The second half was all New Zealand as they scored five tries to Ben Smith, Charlie Faumuina, Luke Romano and Crotty twice against a solitary penalty from Sanchez. Australia hosted South Africa, ending a six match losing streak after clinching a 23–17 victory in the wet at Brisbane. Only one point separated the two teams at the half time break. Whiteley and Goosen had scored tries early for South Africa to give them the lead, while an Adam Coleman try and two Foley penalties brought Australia to within one point. Early in the second half South African lock Eben Etzebeth was sin binned for a dangerous challenge and Foley kicked the resulting penalty to give Australia a slight lead. Foley then scored the decisive try 20 minutes later to give them their first win of the tournament.\nIn the fourth round New Zealand continued their winning form, downing South Africa 41–13 in Christchurch, while Argentina fell to a 36–20 defeat in Australia. New Zealand hooker Coles set up tries for Dagg, Julian Savea and Sam Whitelock with some crisp passing. Ben Smith, Ardie Savea and TJ Perenara also scored tries, while South Africa's only try came early when Habana crossed in the first 10 minutes. Australia jumped to a 21-point lead against Argentina after Samu Kerevi, Dane Haylett-Petty and Will Genia all scored converted tries in the first 12 minutes. Argentina responded with two penalties and at half-time the score was 21–6. Cordera scored early in the second half to bring the deficit to eight, before Sean McMahon beat four defenders to set up Genia's second try. Quade Cooper then set up a decisive try for Michael Hooper to give Australia a 20-point lead, with Argentina only managing a late consolation try to Facundo Isa.\nFour wins from four games and four bonus points for scoring at least three tries more than their opposition in each game meant that the Rugby Championship title returned to New Zealand with two rounds still to play.\n The 24 tries scored by New Zealand at this point in the tournament is more than the other three nations combined and they are within three wins of the record for the longest winning streak in tests. Stuart Barnes has labelled the current New Zealand team the most dominant in rugby history, something which former New Zealand captain Sean Fitzpatrick does not think is \"good for the game as a whole\".\nFixtures.\nRound 1.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 2.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 3.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 4.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 5.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 6.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nSquads.\nSummary.\nNote: Ages, caps and domestic side are of 20 August 2016 – the starting date of the tournament\nArgentina.\nOn 20 July 2016, Argentina named a 33-man squad for the Championship.\n1 On 10 August 2016, Felipe Arregui, replacing Santiago García Botta, was named in Argentina's 26-man travelling squad for the opening match against South Africa.\nAustralia.\nOn 29 July 2016, Michael Cheika named a 36-man training squad for the 2016 Rugby Championship.\nOn 5 August, Cheika named the final 33-man squad for the Championship, with Nick Frisby, Luke Morahan and Toby Smith missing out on the final squad.\n1 On 4 September, Rory Arnold, Kyle Godwin, Luke Morahan, Sefa Naivalu and Henry Speight were called up to the squad as injury replacements and cover for Adam Ashley-Cooper (returned to France), Matt Giteau and Rob Horne (ruled out for remainder of Championship) and Ben McCalman and Matt To'omua (still recovering from injury sustained in Round 1).\n2 On 11 September, Toby Smith was called up to the squad as injury cover for Allan Alaalatoa, who was ruled out of Round 4 after sustaining an injury against South Africa in Round 3.\n3 On 21 September, Nick Frisby and Tolu Latu was called up to the squad for the final two rounds, with Latu replacing Tatafu Polota-Nau in the squad due to injury.\n4 On 3 October, Leroy Houston was called up to the squad as an injury replacement for Sean McMahon ahead of the final round of the Championship.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand's 32-man squad for the Championship was announced on 1 August 2016.\n1 On 11 August, Anton Lienert-Brown was called up to replace Sonny Bill Williams who was injured during the 2016 Summer Olympics rugby sevens tournament.\n2 On 14 August, Kane Hames and Matt Todd were added to the squad for the first match of the Championship as injury cover for Joe Moody and Sam Cane.\n3 On 22 August, Liam Coltman, Rieko Ioane, Damian McKenzie, James Parsons and Seta Tamanivalu were called up to the squad as injury cover for Ryan Crotty, Nathan Harris, George Moala, Waisake Naholo and Codie Taylor.\nSouth Africa.\nHead coach Allister Coetzee named the following 31-man training squad for the 2016 Rugby Championship on 6 August 2016:\n1 Trevor Nyakane was initially included pending medical clearance.

The last time these two met Karakhanyan defeated Jenkins by guillotine choke in the first round.\nAdditionally, four-time NCAA Division II Champion wrestler Joey Davis made his professional MMA debut on this card; as an amateur he had a record of 5-0.

        "text": "Happy Hogan (born Wallace Louis Bray, formal baseball name Wallace Louis Hogan; 1877–1915) was an American minor league baseball catcher and manager in the early 20th century. He is a member of the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame.\nHogan was born on October 13, 1877, in Santa Clara, California. He played at Santa Clara College and then the University of Southern California (USC), captaining the USC Trojans to a championship. He first played professionally in 1901 in the 1899–1902 iteration of the California League. His team, the Sacramento Solons, moved to the Pacific Coast League (PCL) as a founding member in 1903, and Hogan remained in the PCL for the rest of his career. He played through the 1914 season, serving as a player-manager 1909–1914.\nHogan changed his last name, at least for baseball purposes, from Bray to hide his participation in the then–somewhat–déclassé profession of baseball from his father. Although Hogan was a very poor hitter (his lifetime batting average is .180 and slugging average is .217), he was a good catcher, had a scrappy larger-than-life personality and was a well-known figure in the beginning days of the PCL, was the longest-serving player from the PCL's founding year (1903–1914), and managed the Vernon/Venice Tigers (1909–1915), dying in harness. He was selected to the league's hall of fame either in 1943 or at some unknown point between 1943 and 1958 (detailed records have not been kept).\nAfter Hogan took over the manager's chair of the Vernon Tigers in 1909, newspapers sometimes called the team \"Hogan's Tigers\". As a manager, Hogan was an advocate of the controversial innovation of uniform numbers.\nHogan contracted pneumonia and died on May 17, 1915, in Los Angeles at age 37."

The freestanding carbonfiber rotating masts were manufactured by Magma Structures at Trafalgar Wharf, Portsmouth. Doyle Sailmakers USA manufactured the three fully automated carbonfiber/taffeta full roach sails. The furling booms were built in Valencia by Future Fibres. The rigging of the yacht was developed partially to be implemented on cargo ships and for commercial use. The vessel features an underwater observation pod in the keel with -thick glass. It is the largest private sail-assisted motor yacht in the world.\nSailing Yacht \"A\" was delivered by Nobiskrug on 3 February 2017, and left Kiel on 5 February 2017. It exited the Baltic Sea in light mode on near-empty fuel tanks in order to clear the Drogden Strait with minimum draught. It underwent final sea trials and the final fit-out at the Navantia shipyard in Cartagena, Spain. \"Boat International\" called it \"the boundary pushing superyacht\". The yacht is owned by Melnichenko through Valla Yachts Ltd. of Bermuda, and was initially registered there at Hamilton. In December 2021 the yacht was moved to the Isle of Man flag and registered at Douglas.\nSanctions.\nThe yacht was seized by the Italian Guardia di Finanza on 12 March 2022 in the port of Trieste, due to the EU's sanctions imposed on a number of Russian businessmen as a consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A spokesperson for Melnichenko vowed to contest the seizure. While under seizure, the yacht was re-registered in June 2022 at Freetown, under the Sierra Leone flag. As of September 2023, the yacht was at an anchorage in the Gulf of Trieste."

        "title": "1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game",
        "text": "The 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game took place on April 5, 1993 between the North Carolina Tar Heels and Michigan Wolverines at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The match-up was the final one of the fifty-fifth consecutive NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship single-elimination tournament — commonly referred to as the NCAA Tournament — organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and is used to crown a national champion for men's basketball at the Division I level.\nThe Tar Heels won their third NCAA Men's Basketball National Championship, after having been victorious in 1957 and 1982 beforehand. Donald Williams was named the NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player for his efforts throughout the tournament. This was the third consecutive national championship won by the ACC.\nOverview.\nMichigan and North Carolina were portrayed as different playing styles, with Michigan having an \"NBA–style\" roster and UNC having \"the model college system.\" Kansas center Eric Pauley, who played both teams, stated that Michigan was \"really athletic,\" while North Carolina was \"fundamentally sound.\" In addition, Michigan was known for allowing freshmen to get significant playing time, while also allowing their players to be more \"flamboyant\" and expressive. With respect to the sophomores on the Michigan roster, coach Smith said he was \"amazed at what they had done\" and mentioned how they had been to two Final Fours in as many years, further stating \"that's a lifetime.\" The Tar Heels, on the other hand, were known for being a program where upperclassmen get more of the publicity and playing time. Montross commented on North Carolina's perception and related it to how Dean Smith \"won't settle for anything but the image he has,\" while referencing their clean shaven appearance, proper dress attire when traveling and going to dinners, and their \"[doing] everything just right.\nDean Smith, who had only one national championship to his credit from 1982, was viewed to have needed the game for his legacy as it would \"shut up\" critics. In addition, it would bring the Tar Heels to the forefront after Duke having won the previous two national championships. Meanwhile, Steve Fisher, was thought to have needed to win the title in order to vindicate to critics that he \"can coach.\" He had previously won a national title in 1989 when he gained control of Michigan's team before the start of the NCAA Tournament. In advance of the game Smith spoke of Wolverines saying \"They're quick, and Coach Fisher has done a great job getting the ball inside. They know how to pass and catch it.\"\nAs the two teams met in December in the Rainbow Classic, most media commented on the game and influenced their expectations. It was noted that the game would be different as Michigan's Jackson would be expected to play more than the minute he did in December before he left the game with a dislocated shoulder. Coach Smith felt Michigan relied on Jackson defensively and noted that he has been doing well on offense as of late. Mark Rosner of \"Austin American–Statesman\" wrote that North Carolina was performing much better on offense than they were in that December matchup.\nWriters noted that Howard, Eric Reilly, and Webber would likely rotate on the seven–footer Montross, but Webber has the \"brawn\" to go against Montross. In regards to facing off and defending Montross, Webber stated \"I'm not afraid of anyone.\" Montross spoke of Webber and his matchup saying that \"Blocking shots is going to happen. He's got me. I got him.\" Rose was thought to have a great performance as he would need to minimize his turnovers.\nGame summary.\nSource:\n&lt;br&gt;\nNorth Carolina led 72-67 with a minute left. After Ray Jackson hit a jumper with 46 seconds left to make it a three-point game, the Wolverines called their final timeout. On the Tar Heels' inbounds pass, Brian Reese stepped out of bounds, turning the ball over to Michigan. Jalen Rose missed a three-pointer that would have tied the game, but Chris Webber got the rebound and scored with 36 seconds remaining, bringing the Wolverines within one. Pat Sullivan was fouled with 20 seconds left. He made the front end of a one-and-one and was given a second free throw, which he missed. Webber rebounded for the Wolverines, who were down by two points and out of timeouts. Webber traveled, but none of the officials saw it. He then made a more costly mistake—with 11 seconds left, he called a timeout, even though Michigan had no timeouts left, meaning that North Carolina would have two free throws and then possession of the ball. Donald Williams made both free throws, giving North Carolina a 75-71 lead. With 8 seconds left, Williams was fouled, and hit both free throws for the final points of the game. Rose then missed a three-pointer, which would not have mattered—even if he had made it, the clock would have run out. North Carolina won by the final score of 77-71.\nAftermath.\nMichigan would later vacate it’s appearance in both the 1992 and 1993 Final Four and their subsequent title games due to issues found with the eligibility of Chris Webber in the Ed Martin scandal. While the other members of the Fab Five were cleared of any wrongdoing, the group’s reputation was nonetheless tarnished by the scandal. As a result of the scandal, Michigan entered a slump during the 2000s and would not return to the Final Four until 2013. They would also return to the championship game in 2013 as well, where they lost to Louisville who, ironically, would vacate their title due to a major scandal.\nNorth Carolina would not return to the national championship game until 2005, where they defeated another Big Ten team in Illinois to win their fourth championship."

Only wickets attributed to the bowler count towards a hat-trick; run outs do not count.\nIn ODIs history there have been just 49 hat-tricks, the first achieved by Jalal-ud-Din for Pakistan against Australia in 1982.\nWicket-keeping records.\nThe wicket-keeper is a specialist fielder who stands behind the stumps being guarded by the batsman on strike and is the only member of the fielding side allowed to wear gloves and leg pads.\nMost career dismissals.\nA wicket-keeper can be credited with the dismissal of a batsman in two ways, caught or stumped. A fair catch is taken when the ball is caught fully within the field of play without it bouncing after the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat, Laws 5.6.2.2 and 5.6.2.3 state that the hand or the glove holding the bat shall be regarded as the ball striking or touching the bat while a stumping occurs when the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket while the batsman is out of his ground and not attempting a run.\nNew Zealand's Brendon McCullum is sixth in taking most dismissals in ODIs as a designated wicket-keeper with Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara and Australian Adam Gilchrist heading the list.\nMost career catches.\nMcCullum is 5th in taking most catches in ODIs as a designated wicket-keeper.\nMost career stumpings.\nDhoni holds the record for the most stumpings in ODIs with 123 followed by Sri Lankans Sangakkara and Romesh Kaluwitharana.\nMost dismissals in an innings.\nTen wicket-keepers on 15 occasions have taken six dismissals in a single innings in an ODI. Adam Gilchrist of Australia alone has done it six times.\nThe feat of taking 5 dismissals in an innings has been achieved by 49 wicket-keepers on 87 occasions including four New Zealanders.\nMost dismissals in a series.\nGilchrist also holds the ODIs record for the most dismissals taken by a wicket-keeper in a series. He made 27 dismissals during the 1998-99 Carlton &amp; United Series. New Zealand record is held by Tom Latham when he made 21 dismissals during the 2019 Cricket World Cup.\nFielding records.\nMost career catches.\nCaught is one of the nine methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket. The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen.\nSri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene holds the record for the most catches in ODIs by a non-wicket-keeper with 218, followed by Ricky Ponting of Australia on 160 and New Zealand Mohammad Azharuddin with 156.Ross Taylor is the leading catcher for New Zealand.\nMost catches in an innings.\nSouth Africa's Jonty Rhodes is the only fielder to have taken five catches in an innings.\nThe feat of taking 4 catches in an innings has been achieved by 42 fielders on 44 occasions including seven New Zealand fielders.\nMost catches in a series.\nThe 2019 Cricket World Cup, which was won by England for the first time, saw the record set for the most catches taken by a non-wicket-keeper in an ODI series. Englishman batsman and captain of the England Test team Joe Root took 13 catches in the series as well as scored 556 runs. Jeremy Coney with 11 catches in 1980-81 Benson &amp; Hedges World Series is the leading New Zealand on this list.\nAll-round Records.\n1000 runs and 100 wickets.\nA total of 64 players have achieved the double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in their ODI career.\n250 runs and 5 wickets in a series.\nA total of 50 players on 103 occasions have achieved the double of 250 runs and 5 wickets in a series.\nOther records.\nMost career matches.\nIndia's Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the most ODI matches played with 463, with former captains Mahela Jayawardene and Sanath Jayasuriya being second and third having represented Sri Lanka on 443 and 441 occasions, respectively. Former New Zealand skippers Daniel Vettori and Stpehen Fleming are top two most experienced New Zealand plpayers having represented their national teams on 291 and 279 occasions, respectively.\nMost consecutive career matches.\nTendulkar also holds the record for the most consecutive ODI matches played with 185. He broke Richie Richardson's long standing record of 132 matches.\nMost matches as captain.\nRicky Ponting, who led the Australian cricket team from 2002 to 2012, holds the record for the most matches played as captain in ODIs with 230 (including 1 as captain of ICC World XI team).Stephen Fleming has led New Zealand in 218 matches, second highest behind Ponting.\nYoungest players on Debut.\nThe youngest player to play in an ODI match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 233 days. Making his debut for Sri Lanka against Zimbabwe on 30 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time.\nOldest players on Debut.\nThe Netherlands batsmen Nolan Clarke is the oldest debutant to appear in an ODI match. Playing in the 1996 Cricket World Cup against New Zealand in 1996 at Reliance Stadium in Vadodara, India he was aged 47 years and 240 days.\nOldest players.\nThe Netherlands batsmen Nolan Clarke is the oldest player to appear in an ODI match. Playing in the 1996 Cricket World Cup against South Africa in 1996 at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi, Pakistan he was aged 47 years and 257 days.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest ODI partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the West Indian pairing of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels who put together a second wicket partnership of 372 runs during the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe in February 2015. This broke the record of 331 runs set by Indian pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid against New Zealand in 1999\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nRudi Koertzen of South Africa holds the record for the most ODI matches umpired with 209. The current active Aleem Dar is currently at 208 matches. They are followed by New Zealand's Billy Bowden who officiated in 200 matches."

        "title": "World Women's Snooker Championship",
        "text": "The World Women's Snooker Championship (known as the Women's World Open from 1976 to 1981 and the World Ladies Snooker Championship from 1983 to 2018) is the longest-running and most prestigious tournament on the World Women's Snooker Tour. Staged 41 times since the inaugural edition in 1976, it has produced 15 different champions, six of whom have won the title more than once. \nThe inaugural champion was Vera Selby, who won the title twice. The most successful player in the tournament's history has been Reanne Evans, who has won 12 titles, followed by Allison Fisher with seven titles and Kelly Fisher with five. Although the tournament had only one winner from outside the United Kingdom before 2014 (Australia's Lesley McIlrath in 1980) most recent editions have been won by Asian players, with Hong Kong's Ng On-yee winning three titles in 2015, 2017 and 2018, Thai players Mink Nutcharut and Baipat Siripaporn winning respectively in 2022 and 2023, and China's Bai Yulu claiming her first title in 2024. The youngest champion in the tournament's history is Ann-Marie Farren, who won the title aged 16 years and 47 days in 1987.\nIn 2021, the World Women’s Snooker Tour became an official qualification route to the main professional World Snooker Tour. At the end of each season, the reigning World Women’s Snooker Champion receives a professional tour card for the following two seasons, as does the highest-ranked player in the women's rankings who is not already on the tour. If the World Champion is already on the tour, that card will be issued to the next highest ranked player who is not on the tour.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1931, the Women's Billiards Association (WBA) organised an amateur women's snooker championship that took place most years from 1933 until the 1970s. The WBA also held the Women's Professional Snooker Championship annually from 1934 to 1941 and 1947 to 1950, but then discontinued it due to lack of public interest. The standard of amateur women's snooker was generally perceived as poor throughout the 1930s, but women's participation improved in the postwar era, including the formation of women's snooker leagues, producing improvements in the quality of play. The billiard trade company Burroughes and Watts often supported women's competitions, but that support ended after Riley took over the company in 1967. The number of competitions reduced, and the amateur championship lacked sponsorship and suffered from poor organisation.\nIn 1976, the Women's Billiards and Snooker Association was established. The Q Promotions company gained sponsorship from tobacco brand Embassy for a 1976 Women's World Open, as part of Embassy's deal to sponsor the 1976 World Snooker Championship. Over sixty players entered, including former amateur champions Maureen Baynton and Rosemary Davies, who both came out of retirement, and Joyce Gardner, runner-up in the professional championships of 1934, 1935 and 1937. Held at Middlesbrough Town Hall, the 1976 championship is recognised today by World Women's Snooker as the first edition of the World Women's Snooker Championship. Vera Selby, the reigning amateur champion for four seasons before the tournament, defeated Muriel Hazeldene 4–0 in the final and won £500 plus a Jaeger-LeCoultre watch worth another £500.\nThe next edition took place in 1980, when 46 players entered. Australian player Lesley McIlrath won the final 4–2 over Agnes Davies, who had won the Women's Professional Snooker Championship in 1949. The tournament was staged again the following year, 1981, when Selby regained her title with a 3–0 victory over Mandy Fisher in the final. The first three championships were governed by the Women's Billiards and Snooker Association, but from 1983 the championship was controlled by the World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association (WLBSA), which was closely associated with Ladies Snooker International, a management and promotions company that had signed many of the leading female players.\nIn 1984, the WLBSA held an amateur championship, won by 15-year-old Stacey Hillyard, and a five-tournament Grand Prix series, won by Mandy Fisher. The latter is now regarded as an edition of the World Women's Snooker Championship. The 1985 Amateur Championship attracted 78 entries and was won by Allison Fisher, who lost only one during the tournament; this is recognised today as the 1985 edition of the tournament. The WLBSA abolished the distinction between amateur and professional status the following year. Fisher went on to win a further six world titles, most recently in 1994.\nBarry Hearn's Matchroom company promoted the 1990 World Championship, with sponsorship from Trusthouse Forte and a total prize fund of £30,000, including £10,000 for the champion. The previous record for the tournament prize fund had been £10,000, with £3,500 for the winner. It was the first event in Matchroom's five-year deal with the WLBSA, which guaranteed at least £50,000 in world championship prize money across five years. Karen Corr won the title in 1990, 1995 and 1997; and Kelly Fisher won the title five times in six years from 1998 to 2003. Dissatisfied with her earnings from the game, Allison Fisher left the snooker circuit in 1997 to compete on the WPBA nine-ball pool tour in the United States. Both Corr and Kelly Fisher later followed that route.\nIn 1994, the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final were held in New Delhi, India, the tournament's first staging outside the United Kingdom. The prize money was reduced in1994, and again in 1995, when the final stages were again held in New Delhi. During the next edition, which extended from 1996 into 1997 due to delays in scheduling the final rounds, Hearn requested the termination of the contract with the WLBSA to promote the event in future.\nin 1997, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) took over the WLBSA, pledging to provide additional prize money. From 1998 to 2003, Embassy sponsored the tournament, with the semi-finals and final taking place at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield during the World Snooker Championship. The WPBSA ceased supporting the women's circuit in 2003, following the UK government's restrictions on tobacco sponsorship of sport, and the championship was not held in 2004.\nThe tournament was revived in 2005. Since then, its most successful competitor has been Reanne Evans, who has won the title a record 12 times, including ten consecutive victories from 2005 to 2014 followed by further titles in 2016 and 2019. Hong Kong's Ng On-yee became the tournament's first Asian winner in 2015, adding further titles in 2017 and 2018. The 2017 event was held in Toa Payoh, Singapore, the first time since 1995 that the tournament was held outside the UK. In 2018, the World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association was rebranded as World Women's Snooker, and the tournament was renamed the World Women's Snooker Championship.\nThe tournament was not staged in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the tournament's trophy was renamed the Mandy Fisher Trophy. Fisher founded the World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association in 1981, won the women's world title in 1984, and, as of March 2024, serves as president of World Women's Snooker.\nBeginning in 2021, the World Women's Snooker Tour became an official qualification pathway to the World Snooker Tour. The World Women's Champion automatically receives a professional tour card for the following two seasons, although if she already holds a place on the professional tour, the next highest ranked player not on tour will receive a place. The 2022 and 2023 tournaments were won respectively by Thai players Mink Nutcharut and Baipat Siripaporn, ending a 19-year period in which every world title had been won either by Evans or Ng. China hosted the event for the first time in 2024, with the tournament staged in Dongguan. Bai Yulu defeated Nutcharut 6–5 in the final, becoming the first winner from mainland China.\nThe highest break in the history of the tournament is 127 by Bai in the group stages of the 2023 event.\nAnn-Marie Farren, who was aged 16 years and 47 days when she won the title in 1987, is recognised by Guinness World Records as the tournament's youngest winner as of 2024."

        "title": "Early history of American football",
        "text": "The early history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football. Both games have their origin in varieties of football played in Britain in the mid–19th century, in which a football is kicked at a goal or run over a line, which in turn were based on the varieties of English public school football games.\nAmerican football resulted from several major divergences from association football and rugby football, most notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, a Yale University and Hopkins School graduate considered to be the \"father of gridiron football\". Among these important changes were the introduction of the line of scrimmage, of down-and-distance rules and of the legalization of interference.\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, gameplay developments by college coaches such as Eddie Cochems, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Parke H. Davis, Knute Rockne, John Heisman, and Glenn \"Pop\" Warner helped take advantage of the newly introduced forward pass. The popularity of college football grew in the United States for the first half of the 20th century. Bowl games, a college football tradition, attracted a national audience for college teams. Boosted by fierce rivalries and colorful traditions, college football still holds widespread appeal in the United States.\nThe origin of professional football can be traced back to 1892, with Pudge Heffelfinger's $500 contract to play in a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. In 1920 the American Professional Football Association was formed. This league changed its name to the National Football League (NFL) two years later, and eventually became the major league of American football. Initially a sport of Midwestern industrial towns, professional football eventually became a national phenomenon.\nHistory of American football before 1869.\nPrehistory of American football.\nIn 1911, influential American football historian Parke H. Davis wrote an early history of the game of football, tracing the sport's origins to ancient times:\nForms of traditional football have been played throughout Europe and beyond since antiquity. Many of these involved handling of the ball, and scrummage-like formations. Several of the oldest examples of football-like games include the Greek game of Episkyros and the Roman game of Harpastum. Over time many countries across the world have also developed their own national football-like games. For example, New Zealand had Kī-o-rahi, Australia marn grook, Japan kemari, China cuju, Georgia lelo burti, the Scottish Borders Jeddart Ba' and Cornwall Cornish hurling, Central Italy Calcio Fiorentino, South Wales cnapan, East Anglia Campball and Ireland had caid, which an ancestor of Gaelic football.\nThere is also one reference to ball games being played in southern Britain prior to the Norman Conquest. In the ninth century Nennius's \"Historia Britonum\" tells that a group of boys were playing at ball (\"pilae ludus\"). The origin of this account is either southern England or Wales. References to a ball game played in northern France known as \"La Soule\" or \"Choule\", in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks, date from the 12th century.\nThese archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers at each end of a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. Sometimes instead of markers, the teams would attempt to kick the bladder into the balcony of the opponents' church. A legend that these games in England evolved from a more ancient and bloody ritual of kicking the \"Dane's head\" is unlikely to be true.\nFew images of medieval football survive. One engraving from the early fourteenth century at Gloucester Cathedral, England, clearly shows two young men running vigorously towards each other with a ball in mid-air between them. There is a hint that the players may be using their hands to strike the ball. A second medieval image in the British Museum, London clearly shows a group of men with a large ball on the ground. The ball clearly has a seam where leather has been sewn together. It is unclear exactly what is happening in this set of three images, although the last image appears to show a man with a broken arm. It is likely that this image highlights the dangers of some medieval football games.\nMost of the very early references to the game speak simply of \"ball play\" or \"playing at ball\". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.\nThe first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:\nNumerous attempts were made to ban football games, particularly the most rowdy and disruptive forms. This was especially the case in England, and in other parts of Europe, during the Middle Ages and early modern period. Between 1324 and 1667, in England alone, football was banned by more than 30 royal and local laws. The need to repeatedly proclaim such laws demonstrated the difficulty in enforcing bans on popular games. King Edward II was so troubled by the unruliness of football in London that, on April 13, 1314, he issued a proclamation banning it:\nIn 1531, Sir Thomas Elyot wrote that:\nThese antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways. Antithetical to social change this anachronism of football continued to be played in some parts of the United Kingdom. These games still survive in a number of towns notably the Ba game played at Christmas and New Year at Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands Scotland, Uppies and Downies over Easter at Workington in Cumbria and the Royal Shrovetide Football Match on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday at Ashbourne in Derbyshire, England.\nFootball in America.\nIn 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland. There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called \"Aqsaqtuk\". Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, William Strachey, an English colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called \"Pahsaheman\".\nAlthough there are mentions of Native Americans playing games, modern American football has its origins in the traditional football games played in the cities, villages and schools of Europe for many centuries before America was settled by Europeans. Early games appear to have had much in common with the traditional \"mob football\" played in England. The games remained largely unorganized until the 19th century, when intramural games of football began to be played on college campuses. Each school played its own variety of football. Princeton University students played a game called \"ballown\" as early as 1820.\nA Harvard tradition known as \"Bloody Monday\" began in 1827, which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman and sophomore classes. In 1860, both the town police and the college authorities agreed the Bloody Monday had to go. The Harvard students responded by going into mourning for a mock figure called \"Football Fightum\", for whom they conducted funeral rites. The authorities held firm and it was a dozen years before football was once again played at Harvard. Dartmouth played its own version called \"Old division football\", the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the game dates to as early as the 1830s.\nAll of these games, and others, shared certain commonalities. They remained largely \"mob\" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common. The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. Yale, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860.\nThe \"Boston game\".\nWhile the game was banned in colleges, it was becoming popular in numerous east coast prep schools. In the 1860s, manufactured inflatable balls were introduced through the innovations of shoemaker Richard Lindon. These were much more regular in shape than the handmade balls of earlier times, making kicking and carrying easier. Two general types of football had evolved by this time: \"kicking\" games (like the game played at Cambridge University) which later served as the basis for the rules of the Football Association (soccer) in 1863, and \"running\" (or \"carrying\") games, which later served as the basis for the \"laws\" laid down by the Rugby Football Union in 1871. A hybrid of the two, known as the \"Boston game\", was already played by a team called the Oneida Football Club. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1862 by graduates of Boston's elite preparatory schools. They played mostly among themselves, though they organized a team of non-members to play a game in November 1863, which the Oneidas won easily. The game caught the attention of the press, and \"the Boston game\" continued to spread throughout the 1860s. Oneida, from 1862 to 1865, reportedly never lost a game or even gave up a single point.\nThe game began to return to college campuses by the late 1860s. Yale, Princeton, Rutgers University, and Brown University began playing the popular \"kicking\" game during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the London Football Association. A \"running game\", resembling rugby football, was taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868.\nEarly history of intercollegiate football (1869–1932).\nAmerican football historian Parke H. Davis described the period between 1869 and 1875 as the 'Pioneer Period'; the years 1876–93 he called the 'Period of the American Intercollegiate Football Association'; and the years 1894–1933 he dubbed the 'Period of Rules Committees and Conferences'.\nPioneer period (1869–1875).\nRutgers–Princeton (1869).\nOn November 6, 1869, Rutgers University faced Princeton University (then known as the College of New Jersey) in a game that was played with a round ball and used a set of rules suggested by Rutgers captain William J. Leggett, based on London's The Football Association's first set of rules, which were an early attempt by the former pupils of England's public schools, to unify the rules of their public schools games and create a universal and standardized set of rules for the game of football and bore little resemblance to the American game which would be developed in the following decades. By tradition more than any other criteria, it is usually regarded as the first game of intercollegiate American football. William S. Gummere conceived the idea of an intercollegiate game between Princeton and Rutgers. He invented a set of rules and convinced William S. Leggett to join him.\nThe game was played at a Rutgers field. Two teams of 25 players attempted to score by kicking the ball over the opposing team's goal. Throwing or carrying the ball was not allowed, but there was plenty of physical contact between players. The first team to reach six goals was declared the winner. Rutgers won by a score of six to four. A rematch was played at Princeton a week later under Princeton's own set of rules (one notable difference was the awarding of a \"free kick\" to any player that caught the ball on the fly, which was a feature adopted from the Football Association's rules; the fair catch kick rule has survived through to modern American game). Princeton won that game by a score of 8–0. Columbia joined the series in 1870, and by 1872 several schools were fielding intercollegiate teams, including Yale and Stevens Institute of Technology.\nEarly efforts to organize the game.\nColumbia University was the third school to field a team. The Lions traveled from New York City to New Brunswick on November 12, 1870, and were defeated by Rutgers 6 to 3. Teams fielded 20 men per side, included two goalkeepers each. The game suffered from disorganization and the players kicked and battled each other as much as the ball.\nLater in 1870, Princeton and Rutgers played again with Princeton defeating Rutgers 6–0. This game's violence caused such an outcry that no games at all were played in 1871. Football came back in 1872, when Columbia played Yale for the first time. The Yale team was coached and captained by David Schley Schaff, who had learned to play football while attending Rugby school. Schaff himself was injured and unable to the play the game, but Yale won the game 3–0 nonetheless. Later in 1872, Stevens Tech became the fifth school to field a team. Stevens lost to Columbia, but beat both New York University and City College of New York during the following year. \nBy 1873, the college students playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The only way to score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify the first set of intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, which founded the first Intercollegiate Football Association, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting a list of rules, based more on The Football Association's rules than the recently founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.\nHarvard–McGill (1874).\nOld \"Football Fightum\" had been resurrected at Harvard in 1872, when Harvard resumed playing football. Harvard, however, had adopted a version of football which allowed carrying, albeit only when the player carrying the ball was being pursued. As a result of this, Harvard refused to attend the rules conference organized by the other schools and continued to play under its own code. While Harvard's voluntary absence from the meeting made it hard for them to schedule games against other American universities, it agreed to a challenge to play McGill University, from Montreal, in a two-game series. Inasmuch as rugby football had been transplanted to Canada from England, the McGill team played under a set of rules which allowed a player to pick up the ball and run with it whenever he wished. Another rule, unique to McGill, was to count tries (the act of grounding the football past the opposing team's goal line; it is important to note that there was no end zone during this time), as well as goals, in the scoring. In the Rugby rules of the time, a touchdown only provided the chance to kick a free goal from the field. If the kick was missed, the touchdown did not count.\nThe McGill team traveled to Cambridge to meet Harvard. On May 14, 1874, the first game, played under Harvard's rules, was won by Harvard with a score of 3–0. The next day, the two teams played under \"McGill\" rugby rules to a scoreless tie. The games featured a round ball instead of a rugby-style oblong ball. This series of games represents an important milestone in the development of the modern game of American football. In October 1874, the Harvard team once again traveled to Montreal to play McGill in rugby, where they won by three tries.\nHarvard–Tufts, Harvard–Yale (1875).\nHarvard quickly took a liking to the rugby game, and its use of the try which, until that time, was not used in American football. The try would later evolve into the score known as the touchdown. On June 4, 1875, Harvard faced Tufts University in the first game between two American colleges played under rules similar to the McGill–Harvard contest, which was won by Tufts. The rules included each side fielding 11 men, the ball was advanced by kicking or carrying it, and tackles of the ball carrier stopped play. \nFurther elated by the excitement of McGill's version of football, Harvard challenged its closest rival, Yale, to a game which the Bulldogs accepted. The two teams agreed to play under a set of rules called the \"Concessionary Rules\", which involved Harvard conceding something to Yale's soccer and Yale conceding a great deal to Harvard's rugby. They decided to play with 15 players on each team. On November 13, 1875, Yale and Harvard played each other for the first time ever, where Harvard won 4–0. 2,000 spectators watched the first playing of The Game—the annual football contest between Harvard and Yale—including the future \"father of American football\" Walter Camp. Camp, who would enroll at Yale the next year, was torn between an admiration for Harvard's style of play and the misery of the Yale defeat, and became determined to avenge Yale's defeat. Spectators from Princeton also carried the game back home, where it quickly became the most popular version of football.\nPeriod of the American Intercollegiate Football Association (1876–1893).\nMassasoit Convention (1876).\nOn November 23, 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit House hotel in Springfield, Massachusetts to standardize a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. The rules were based largely on the Rugby Football Union's code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring (a change that would later occur in rugby itself, favoring the try as the main scoring event). Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the second Intercollegiate Football Association as a result of the meeting. Yale did not join the group until 1879, because of an early disagreement about the number of players per team. The Intercollegiate Football Association represents the first comprehensive effort to organize and standardize American football.\nWalter Camp: Father of American football.\nWalter Camp is widely considered to be the most important figure in the development of American football. As a youth, he excelled in sports like track, baseball, and association football, and after enrolling at Yale in 1876, he earned varsity honors in every sport the school offered.\nFollowing the introduction of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to him to be a disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. As renowned Yale center Pa Corbin described: \"By standing the ball on end and exercising a certain pressure on the same, it was possible to have it bound into the quarterback's hands.\" Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass. Rugby league followed Camp's example, and in 1906 introduced the play-the-ball rule, which greatly resembled Camp's early scrimmage and center-snap rules. In 1966, Rugby league introduced a four-tackle rule based on Camp's early down-and-distance rules.\nThe 1880 season also saw the first year of 11 players to a team. From 1869 to 1873, one saw 25 players to a side. From 1873 to 1875, one saw 20 players per side. 1876 to 1879 saw 15 players per side.\nCamp's new scrimmage rules revolutionized the game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play to slow the game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined with the establishment of the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.\nCamp was central to several more significant rule changes that came to define American football. In 1881, the field was reduced in size to its modern dimensions of 120 by 53 yards (109.7 by 48.8 meters). Several times in 1883, Camp tinkered with the scoring rules, finally arriving at four points for a touchdown, two points for kicks after touchdowns, two points for safeties, and five for field goals. Camp's innovations in the area of point scoring influenced rugby union's move to point scoring in 1890. In 1887, game time was set at two halves of 45 minutes each. Also in 1887, two paid officials—a referee and an umpire—were mandated for each game. A year later, the rules were changed to allow tackling below the waist, and in 1889, the officials were given whistles and stopwatches.\nAfter his playing career at Yale ended in 1882, Camp was employed by the New Haven Clock Company until his death in 1925. Though no longer a player, he remained a fixture at annual rules meetings for most of his life, and he personally selected an annual All-American team every year from 1889 through 1924. The Walter Camp Football Foundation continues to select All-American teams in his honor.\nInterference.\nThe last, and arguably most important innovation, which would at last make American football uniquely \"American\", was the legalization of interference, or blocking, a tactic which was highly illegal under the rugby-style rules. Interference remains strictly illegal in both rugby codes to today. The prohibition of interference in the rugby game stems from the game's strict enforcement of its offside rule, which prohibited any player on the team with possession of the ball to loiter between the ball and the goal. At first, American players would find creative ways of aiding the runner by pretending to accidentally knock into defenders trying to tackle the runner. When Walter Camp witnessed this tactic being employed during a game he refereed between Harvard and Princeton in 1879, he was at first appalled, but the next year had adopted the blocking tactics for his own team at Yale.\nDuring the 1880s and 1890s, teams developed increasingly complex blocking tactics including the interlocking interference technique known as the Flying wedge or \"V-trick formation\", which was first employed by Richard Hodge at Princeton in 1884 in a game against Penn, however, Princeton put the tactic aside for the next 4 years, only to revive it again in 1888 to combat the three-time All-American Yale guard Pudge Heffelfinger.\nHeffelfinger soon figured out how to break up the formation by leaping high in the air with his legs tucked under him, striking the V like a human cannonball. In 1892, during a game against Yale, a Harvard fan and student Lorin F. Deland first introduced the flying wedge as a kickoff play, in which two five man squads would line up about 25 yards behind the kicker, only to converge in a perfect flying wedge running downfield, where Harvard was able to trap the ball and hand it off to the speedy All-American Charley Brewer inside the wedge.\nDespite their effectiveness, the flying wedge, \"V-trick formation\" and other tactics which involved interlocking interference, were outlawed in 1905 through the efforts of the rule committee led by Parke H. Davis, because of its contribution to serious injury. Non-interlocking interference remains a basic element of modern American football, with many complex schemes being developed and implemented over the years, including zone blocking and pass blocking.\nAlex Moffat.\nAlex Moffat was the early sport's greatest kicker and held a place in Princeton athletic history similar to Camp at Yale. American football historian David M. Nelson credits Moffat with revolutionizing the kicking game in 1883 by developing the \"spiral punt\", described by Nelson as \"a dramatic change from the traditional end-over-end kicks\". He also invented the drop kick.\nHenry \"Tillie\" Lamar.\nThe 1885 season was notable for one of the most celebrated football plays of the 19th century – a 90-yard punt return by Henry \"Tillie\" Lamar of Princeton in the closing minutes of the game against Yale. Trailing 5–0, Princeton dropped two men back to receive a Yale punt. The punt glanced off one returner's shoulder and was caught by the other, Lamar, on the dead run. Lamar streaked down the left sideline, until hemmed in by two Princeton players, then cut sharply to the middle of the field, ducking under their arms and breaking loose for the touchdown. After the controversy of a darkness-shortened Yale-Princeton championship game the year before that was ruled \"no contest\", a record crowd turned out for the 1885 game. For the first time, the game was played on one of the campuses instead of at a neutral site, and emerged as a major social event, attracting ladies to its audience as well as students and male spectators. The Lamar punt return furnished the most spectacular ending to any football game played to that point, and did much to popularize the sport of college football to the general public. One source lists Princeton captain C. M. DeCamp as the player of the year.\nArthur Cumnock.\nHarvard end Arthur Cumnock invented the first nose guard. Cumnock's invention gained popularity, and in 1892, a newspaper article described the growing popularity of the device:\nHe is also credited with having been the person who developed the tradition of spring practice in football; in March 1889, Cumnock led the Harvard team in drills on Jarvis field, which is considered the first-ever spring football practice. In 1913, an article in an Eastern newspaper sought to choose the greatest Harvard football player of all time. The individual chosen was Cumnock, who \"the sons of John Harvard are pretty well agreed\" was \"the greatest Harvard player of all time.\" As for his individual performance in the 1890 Yale game, the writer noted: \"Such tackling as Cumnock did that day probably has never been equaled. He played a star offensive game, but on the defensive he was a terror. Lee McClung would come around the end with the giant Heffelfinger interfering, and the records read: 'Cumnock tackles both and brings them down.\nPeriod of Rules Committees and Conference (1894–1932).\nExpansion (1894–1904).\nCollege football expanded greatly during the last two decades of the 19th century. Several major rivalries date from this time period.\nNovember 1890 was an active time in the sport. In Baldwin City, Kansas, on November 22, 1890, college football was first played in the state of Kansas. Baker beat Kansas 22–9. On the 27th, Vanderbilt played Nashville (Peabody) at Athletic Park and won 40–0. It was the first time organized football played in the state of Tennessee. The 29th also saw the first instance of the Army–Navy Game. Navy won 24–0.\nEast.\nRutgers was first to extend the reach of the game. An intercollegiate game was first played in the state of New York when Rutgers played Columbia on November 2, 1872. It was also the first scoreless tie in the history of the fledgling sport. Yale football started the same year and had its first match against Columbia, the nearest college to play football. It took place at Hamilton Park in New Haven and was the first game in New England. The game used a set of rules based on association football with 20-man sides, played on a field 400 by 250 feet. Yale won 3–0, Tommy Sherman scoring the first goal and Lew Irwin the other two.\nAfter the first game against Harvard, Tufts took its squad to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine for the first football game played in Maine. This occurred on November 6, 1875.\nPenn's Athletic Association was looking to pick \"a twenty\" to play a game of football against Columbia. This \"twenty\" never played Columbia, but did play twice against Princeton. Princeton won both games 6 to 0. The first of these happened on November 11, 1876, in Philadelphia and was the first intercollegiate game in the state of Pennsylvania.\nBrown enters the intercollegiate game in 1878.\nThe first game where one team scored over 100 points happened on October 25, 1884, when Yale routed Dartmouth 113–0. It was also the first time one team scored over 100 points and the opposing team was shut out. The next week, Princeton outscored Lafayette by 140 to 0.\nThe first intercollegiate game in the state of Vermont happened on November 6, 1886, between Dartmouth and Vermont at Burlington, Vermont. Dartmouth won 91 to 0.\nThe first nighttime football game was played in Mansfield, Pennsylvania on September 28, 1892, between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary and ended at halftime in a 0–0 tie. The Army-Navy game of 1893 saw the first documented use of a football helmet by a player in a game. Joseph M. Reeves had a crude leather helmet made by a shoemaker in Annapolis and wore it in the game after being warned by his doctor that he risked death if he continued to play football after suffering an earlier kick to the head.\nHarvard Law School student and football center William H. Lewis became the first African-American to be selected as an All-American in 1892, an honor he would receive again in 1893.\nMidwest.\nIn 1879, the University of Michigan became the first school west of Pennsylvania to establish a college football team. On May 30, 1879, Michigan beat Racine College 1–0 in a game played in Chicago. The \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" called it \"the first rugby-football game to be played west of the Alleghenies.\" Other Midwestern schools soon followed suit, including the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of Minnesota. In 1881, Michigan scheduled games against the top American football teams—the Eastern powerhouses of Harvard, Yale and Princeton.\nOrganized intercollegiate football was first played in the state of Minnesota on September 30, 1882, when Hamline was convinced to play Minnesota after a track meet. Minnesota won 2 to 0. It was the first game west of the Mississippi River. The first western team to travel east was the 1881 Michigan team, which played at Harvard, Yale and Princeton.\nOrganized intercollegiate football was first played in Indiana on May 13, 1884, when Butler defeated DePauw.\nMichigan's 1894 victory over Cornell marked the first victory by a Western football school against one of the Eastern football powers. Up to that point, no Western player had been selected for the annual College Football All-America Teams selected by Eastern football authorities. Michigan lobbied for Fatty Smith as an All-American. The nation's first college football league, the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives (also known as the Western Conference), a precursor to the Big Ten Conference, was founded in 1895.\nLed by coach Fielding H. Yost, Michigan became the first \"western\" national power. From 1901 to 1905, Michigan had a 56-game undefeated streak that included a 1902 trip to play in the first college football bowl game, which later became the Rose Bowl Game. During this streak, Michigan scored 2,831 points while allowing only 40. Stars on the team included Willie Heston and Al Herrnstein.\nNovember 30, 1905, saw Walter Eckersall and Chicago defeat Michigan 2 to 0. Dubbed \"The First Greatest Game of the Century\", broke Michigan's 56-game unbeaten streak and marked the end of the \"Point-a-Minute\" years. Eckersall was selected as the quarterback for Walter Camp's \"All-Time All-America Team\" honoring the greatest college football players during the sport's formative years. After his playing days, Eckersall remained a prominent figure in football. He had a successful dual career as a sportswriter for the \"Chicago Tribune\", and as a referee. As an official, Eckersall was considered one of the best and officiated at many high-profile games.\nSouth.\nSouth Atlantic.\nOrganized intercollegiate football was first played in the state of Virginia and the south on November 2, 1873, in Lexington between Washington and Lee and VMI. Washington and Lee won 4–2. Some industrious students of the two schools organized a game for October 23, 1869 – but it was rained out. Students of the University of Virginia were playing pickup games of the kicking-style of football as early as 1870, and some accounts even claim it organized a game against Washington and Lee College in 1871; but no record has been found of the score of this contest. Due to scantness of records of the prior matches some will claim Virginia v. Pantops Academy November 13, 1887, as the first game in Virginia.\nOn April 9, 1880, at Stoll Field, Transylvania University (then called Kentucky University) beat Centre College by the score of –0 in what is often considered the first recorded game played in the South. The first game of \"scientific football\" in the South was the first instance of the Victory Bell rivalry between North Carolina and Duke (then known as Trinity College) held on Thanksgiving Day, 1888, at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nOn November 30, 1882, cadet Vaulx Carter organized a game between the Naval Academy and the Clifton Athletic Club (in fact Johns Hopkins University) and won 8–0, the first intercollegiate game in Maryland. It snowed heavily before the game, to the point where players for both teams had to clear layers of snow off of the field, making large piles of snow along the sides of the playing ground. Both teams also nailed strips of leather to the bottom of their shoes to help deal with slipping. The field was 110 yards by 53 yards, with goalposts apart and high. During play, the ball was kicked over the seawall a number of times, once going so far out it had to be retrieved by boat before play could continue. The following season, Gallaudet college and Georgetown played twice; the first intercollegiate games in Washington, D. C. The deaf-mute Gallaudet players sewed their own uniforms, made of heavy canvas with black and white stripes.\nOn November 13, 1887, the Virginia Cavaliers and Pantops Academy fought to a scoreless tie in the first organized football game in the state of Virginia. Students at UVA were playing pickup games of the kicking-style of football as early as 1870, and some accounts even claim that some industrious ones organized a game against Washington and Lee College in 1871, just two years after Rutgers and Princeton's historic first game in 1869. But no record has been found of the score of this contest. Washington and Lee also claims a 4 to 2 win over VMI in 1873. The 1889 Virginia Cavaliers are the first to claim a mythical southern championship.\nOn October 18, 1888, the Wake Forest Demon Deacons defeated the North Carolina Tar Heels 6 to 4 in the first intercollegiate game in the state of North Carolina. The first \"scientific game\" in the state occurred on Thanksgiving of the same year when North Carolina played Duke (then Trinity). Duke won 16 to 0. Princeton star Hector Cowan traveled south and trained the Tar Heels.\nThe 116–0 drubbing of Virginia by Princeton in 1890 signaled football's arrival in the south.\nOn September 27, 1902, Georgetown beat Navy 4 to 0. It is claimed by Georgetown authorities as the game with the first ever \"roving center\" or linebacker when Percy Given stood up, in contrast to the usual tale of Germany Schulz. The first linebacker in the South is often considered to be Sewanee's Frank Juhan.\nDeep South.\nOn December 14, 1889, Wofford defeated Furman 5 to 1 in the first intercollegiate game in the state of South Carolina. The game featured no uniforms, no positions, and the rules were formulated before the game. 1896 saw the first instance of the \"Big Thursday\" Clemson–South Carolina rivalry in Columbia, another seminal moment in football below the South Atlantic States.\nJanuary 30, 1892, saw the first football game played in the state of Georgia when the Georgia Bulldogs defeated Mercer 50–0 at Herty Field. The 1892 Vanderbilt Commodores were the first team in the memory of Grantland Rice. Rice recalled Phil Connell then would be a good player in any era.\nThe beginnings of the contemporary Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference start with the founding of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The SIAA was founded on December 21, 1894, by Dr. William Dudley, a chemistry professor at Vanderbilt. The original members were Alabama, Auburn, Georgia, Georgia Tech, North Carolina, , and Vanderbilt. Clemson, Cumberland, Kentucky, LSU, Mercer, Mississippi, Mississippi A&amp;M (Mississippi State), Southwestern Presbyterian University, Tennessee, Texas, Tulane, and the University of Nashville joined the following year in 1895 as invited charter members. The conference was originally formed for \"the development and purification of college athletics throughout the South\".\nIt is thought that the first forward pass in football occurred in the SIAA's first season of play, on October 26, 1895, in a game between Georgia and North Carolina when, out of desperation, the ball was thrown by the North Carolina back Joel Whitaker instead of punted and George Stephens caught the ball. On November 9, 1895 John Heisman executed a hidden ball trick utilizing quarterback Reynolds Tichenor to get Auburn's only touchdown in a 6 to 9 loss to Vanderbilt. During the play the ball was snapped to a half-back who was able to slip it under the back of the quarterback's jersey and who in turn was able to trot in for the touchdown. This was also the first game in the south decided by a field goal. Heisman later used the trick against Pop Warner's Georgia team. Warner picked up the trick and later used it at Cornell against Penn State in 1897. He then used it in 1903 at Carlisle against Harvard and garnered national attention.\nThe 1897 Vanderbilt Commodores won the team's first conference title. The mythical title \"champion of the south\" had to be disputed with Virginia after a scoreless tie. The next season, the Cavaliers defeated Vanderbilt at Louisville 18–0 in the South's most anticipated game of the season. The Cavaliers ended the season with a loss to North Carolina, which finished what is to-date its only undefeated season.\nThe 1899 Sewanee Tigers are one of the all-time great teams of the early sport. The team went 12–0, outscoring opponents 322 to 10. Known as the \"Iron Men\", with just 13 men they had a six-day road trip with five shutout wins over Texas A&amp;M; Texas; Tulane; LSU; and Ole Miss. It is recalled memorably with the phrase \"and on the seventh day they rested\". Grantland Rice called them \"the most durable football team I ever saw.\" The only close game was an 11–10 win over John Heisman's Auburn Tigers. Auburn ran an early version of the hurry-up offense.\nOrganized intercollegiate football was first played in the state of Florida in 1901. A 7-game series between intramural teams from Stetson and Forbes occurred in 1894. The first intercollegiate game between official varsity teams was played on November 22, 1901. Stetson beat Florida Agricultural College at Lake City, one of the four forerunners of the University of Florida, 6–0, in a game played as part of the Jacksonville Fair.\nOn Thanksgiving Day 1903 a game was scheduled in Montgomery, Alabama between the best teams from each region of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association for an \"SIAA championship game\", pitting Cumberland against Heisman's Clemson. The game ended in an 11–11 tie causing many teams to claim the title. Heisman pressed hardest for Cumberland to get the claim of champion. It was his last game as Clemson head coach.\n1904 saw big coaching hires in the south: Mike Donahue at Auburn, John Heisman at Georgia Tech, and Dan McGugin at Vanderbilt were all hired that year. Both Donahue and McGugin just came from the north that year, Donahue from Yale and McGugin from Michigan, and were among the initial inductees of the College Football Hall of Fame. The undefeated 1904 Vanderbilt team scored an average of 52.7 points per game, the most in college football that season, and allowed just four points. One publication claims \"The first scouting done in the South was in 1905, when Dan McGugin and Captain Innis Brown, of Vanderbilt went to Atlanta to see Sewanee play Georgia Tech.\"\nSouthwest.\nThe first college football game in Oklahoma Territory occurred on November 7, 1895, when the 'Oklahoma City Terrors' defeated the Oklahoma Sooners 34 to 0. The Terrors were a mix of Methodist college students and high schoolers. The Sooners did not manage a single first down. By next season, Oklahoma coach John A. Harts had left to prospect for gold in the Arctic. Organized football was first played in the territory on November 29, 1894, between the Oklahoma City Terrors and Oklahoma City High School. The high school won 24 to 0.\nPacific Coast.\nIn 1891, the first Stanford football team was hastily organized and played a four-game season beginning in January 1892 with no official head coach. Following the season, Stanford captain John Whittemore wrote to Yale coach Walter Camp asking him to recommend a coach for Stanford. To Whittemore's surprise, Camp agreed to coach the team himself, on the condition that he finish the season at Yale first. As a result of Camp's late arrival, Stanford played just three official games, against San Francisco's Olympic Club and rival California. The team also played exhibition games against two Los Angeles area teams that Stanford does not include in official results. Camp returned to the East Coast following the season, then returned to coach Stanford in 1894 and 1895. Herbert Hoover was Stanford's student financial manager.\nOn December 25, 1894, Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons agreed to play Camp's Stanford football team in San Francisco in the first postseason intersectional contest, foreshadowing the modern bowl game. Future president Herbert Hoover was Stanford's student financial manager. Chicago won 24 to 4. Stanford won a rematch in Los Angeles on December 29 by 12 to 0.\nUSC first fielded an American football team in 1888. Playing its first game on November 14 of that year against the Alliance Athletic Club, in which USC gained a 16–0 victory. Frank Suffel and Henry H. Goddard were playing coaches for the first team which was put together by quarterback Arthur Carroll; who in turn volunteered to make the pants for the team and later became a tailor. USC faced its first collegiate opponent the following year in fall 1889, playing St. Vincent's College to a 40–0 victory. In 1893, USC joined the Intercollegiate Football Association of Southern California (the forerunner of the SCIAC), which was composed of USC, Occidental College, Throop Polytechnic Institute (Cal Tech), and Chaffey College. Pomona College was invited to enter, but declined to do so. An invitation was also extended to Los Angeles High School.\nThe Big Game between Stanford and California is the oldest college football rivalry in the West. The first game was played on San Francisco's Haight Street Grounds on March 19, 1892, with Stanford winning 14–10. The term \"Big Game\" was first used in 1900, when it was played on Thanksgiving Day in San Francisco. During that game, a large group of men and boys, who were observing from the roof of the nearby S.F. and Pacific Glass Works, fell into the fiery interior of the building when the roof collapsed, resulting in 13 dead and 78 injured. On December 4, 1900, the last victim of the disaster (Fred Lilly) died, bringing the death toll to 22; and, to this day, the \"Thanksgiving Day Disaster\" remains the deadliest accident to kill spectators at a U.S. sporting event.\nThe University of Oregon began playing American football in 1894 and played its first game on March 24, 1894, defeating Albany College 44–3 under head coach Cal Young. Cal Young left after that first game and J.A. Church took over the coaching position in the fall for the rest of the season. Oregon finished the season with two additional losses and a tie, but went undefeated the following season, winning all four of its games under head coach Percy Benson. In 1899, the Oregon football team left the state for the first time, playing the California Golden Bears in Berkeley, California.\nAmerican football at Oregon State University started in 1893 shortly after athletics were initially authorized at the college. Athletics were banned at the school in May 1892, but when the strict school president, Benjamin Arnold, died, President John Bloss reversed the ban. Bloss's son William started the first team, on which he served as both coach and quarterback. The team's first game was an easy 63–0 defeat over the home team, Albany College.\nIn May 1900, Fielding H. Yost was hired as the football coach at Stanford University, and, after traveling home to West Virginia, he arrived in Palo Alto, California, on August 21, 1900. Yost led the 1900 Stanford team to a 7–2–1, outscoring opponents 154 to 20. The next year in 1901, Yost was hired by Charles A. Baird as the head football coach for the Michigan Wolverines football team. On January 1, 1902, Yost's dominating 1901 Michigan Wolverines football team agreed to play a 3–1–2 team from Stanford University in the inaugural \"Tournament East-West football game\" what is now known as the \"Rose Bowl Game\" by a score of 49–0 after Stanford captain Ralph Fisher requested to quit with eight minutes remaining.\nThe 1905 season marked the first meeting between Stanford and USC. Consequently, Stanford is USC's oldest existing rival. The Big Game between Stanford and Cal on November 11, 1905, was the first played at Stanford Field, with Stanford winning 12–5.\nMissouri Valley.\nThe 1905 Washburn vs. Fairmount football game marked the first experiment with the forward pass and with the ten-yard requirement for first downs.\nMountain West.\nThe University of Colorado Boulder began playing American football in 1890. Colorado found much success in its early years, winning eight Colorado Football Association Championships (1894–97, 1901–08).\nThe following was taken from the \"Silver &amp; Gold\" newspaper of December 16, 1898. It was a recollection of the birth of Colorado football written by one of CU's original gridders, John C. Nixon, also the school's second captain. It appears here in its original form:\nIn 1909, the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference was founded, featuring four members, Colorado, Colorado College, Colorado School of Mines, and Colorado Agricultural College. The University of Denver and the University of Utah joined the RMAC in 1910. For its first thirty years, the RMAC was considered a major conference equivalent to today's Division I, before 7 larger members left and formed the Mountain States Conference (also called the Skyline Conference).\nViolence and controversy (1905).\nA Scottish author wrote in 1908 that\nFrom its earliest days as a mob game, football was a violent sport. The 1894 Harvard–Yale game, known as the \"Hampden Park Blood Bath\", resulted in crippling injuries for four players; the contest was suspended until 1897. The annual Army–Navy game was suspended from 1894 to 1898 for similar reasons. One of the major problems was the popularity of mass-formations like the flying wedge, in which a large number of offensive players charged as a unit against a similarly arranged defense. The resultant collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death. Georgia fullback Richard Von Albade Gammon notably died on the field from concussions received against Virginia in 1897, causing Georgia, Georgia Tech, and Mercer to temporarily stop their football programs.\nIn 1905 there were 19 fatalities nationwide. President Theodore Roosevelt reportedly threatened to shut down the game if drastic changes were not made. However, the threat by Roosevelt to eliminate football is disputed by sports historians. What is absolutely certain is that on October 9, 1905, Roosevelt held a meeting of football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Though he lectured on eliminating and reducing injuries, he never threatened to ban football. He also lacked the authority to abolish football and was, in fact, actually a fan of the sport and wanted to preserve it. The President's sons were also playing football at the college and secondary levels at the time.\nMeanwhile, John H. Outland held an experimental game in Wichita, Kansas that reduced the number of scrimmage plays to earn a first down from four to three in an attempt to reduce injuries. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported an increase in punts and considered the game much safer than regular play but that the new rule was not \"conducive to the sport\". Finally, on December 28, 1905, 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer. As a result of this meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), was formed. One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass. Though it was underutilized for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.\nMove towards modernization and innovation (1906–1932).\nAs a result of the 1905–1906 reforms, mass formation plays became illegal and forward passes legal. Bradbury Robinson, playing for visionary coach Eddie Cochems at St. Louis University, threw the first legal pass in a September 5, 1906, game against Carroll College at Waukesha. Other important changes, formally adopted in 1910, were the requirements that at least seven offensive players be on the line of scrimmage at the time of the snap, that there be no pushing or pulling, and that interlocking interference (arms linked or hands on belts and uniforms) was not allowed. These changes greatly reduced the potential for collision injuries. Several coaches emerged who took advantage of these sweeping changes. Amos Alonzo Stagg introduced such innovations as the huddle, the tackling dummy, and the pre-snap shift. Other coaches, such as Pop Warner and Knute Rockne, introduced new strategies that still remain part of the game.\nBesides these coaching innovations, several rules changes during the first third of the 20th century had a profound impact on the game, mostly in opening up the passing game. In 1914, the first roughing-the-passer penalty was implemented. In 1918, the rules on eligible receivers were loosened to allow eligible players to catch the ball anywhere on the field—previously strict rules were in place only allowing passes to certain areas of the field. Scoring rules also changed during this time: field goals were lowered to three points in 1909 and touchdowns raised to six points in 1912.\nStar players that emerged in the early 20th century include Jim Thorpe, Red Grange, and Bronko Nagurski; these three made the transition to the fledgling NFL and helped turn it into a successful league. Sportswriter Grantland Rice helped popularize the sport with his poetic descriptions of games and colorful nicknames for the game's biggest players, including Notre Dame's \"Four Horsemen\" backfield and Fordham University's linemen, known as the \"Seven Blocks of Granite\".\nThorpe gained nationwide attention for the first time in 1911. He scored all his team's points—four field goals and a touchdown—in an 18–15 upset of Harvard. The 1912 season included many rule changes such as the 100-yard field and the 6-point touchdown. The first six-point touchdowns were registered in Carlisle's 50–7 win over Albright College on September 21. At season's end, Jim Thorpe had rushed for some 2,000 yards. Thorpe also competed in track and field, baseball, lacrosse and even ballroom dancing, winning the 1912 intercollegiate ballroom dancing championship. In the spring of 1912, he started training for the Olympics.\nWhen Army scheduled Notre Dame as a warm-up game in 1913, they thought little of the small school. The end Knute Rockne and quarterback Gus Dorais made innovative use of the forward pass, still at that point a relatively unused weapon, to defeat Army 35–13 and helped establish the school as a national power. By 1915, Minnesota developed the first great passing combination of Pudge Wyman to Bert Baston.\nEast.\nThe \"Big Three\" continued their dominance in the early era of the forward pass. Yale's Ted Coy was selected as fullback on Camp's All-Time All-America team. \"He ran through the line with hammering, high knee action then unleashed a fast, fluid running motion through the secondary.\" The Minnesota shift gained national attention when it was adopted by Yale in 1910. Henry L. Williams, an 1891 graduate of Yale, had earlier repeatedly offered to mentor his alma mater in the formation, but was rebuffed because the Elis would \"not [take] football lessons from a Western university.\" In 1910, the Elis suffered early season setbacks at the hands of inferior opponents, and sought an advantage to use in its game against strong Princeton and Harvard squads. Former Yale end Thomas L. Shevlin, who had served as an assistant coach at Minnesota, taught the team the shift. Yale used the Minnesota shift against both opponents, and beat Princeton, 5–3, and tied Harvard, 0–0.\nFritz Pollard attended Brown University, where he majored in chemistry and played half-back on the Brown football team. In 1916 he led Brown to the second Rose Bowl in 1916, in which he was the first black player to play in the Rose Bowl. He became the first black back to be named to Walter Camp's All-America team in 1916, with Camp ranking Pollard as \"one of the greatest runners these eyes have ever seen\". For his exploits at Brown, Pollard was elected to the National College Football Hall of Fame in 1954 — the first black person ever chosen.\nThe game between West Virginia and Pittsburgh on October 8, 1921, saw the first live radio broadcast of a college football game when Harold W. Arlin announced that year's Backyard Brawl played at Forbes Field on KDKA. Pitt won 21–13.\nBill Roper had installed a passing attack at Princeton. On October 28, 1922, Princeton and Chicago played the first game to be nationally broadcast on radio. Princeton won 21–18 in a hotly contested game which had Princeton dubbed the \"Team of Destiny\" by Grantland Rice.\nIn 1925, Dartmouth beat Cornell 62–13 on its way to a national title. Swede Oberlander threw for 6 touchdowns and accounted for 477 yards of total offense. Cornell coach Gil Dobie retorted \"We won 13–0. Passing is not football.\"\nMidwest.\nIn 1907 at Champaign, Illinois Chicago and Illinois played in the first game to have a halftime show featuring a marching band. Chicago won 42–6.\nNotre Dame and Iowa.\nKnute Rockne took over from his predecessor Jesse Harper in the war-torn season of 1918 with a team including George Gipp and Curly Lambeau. With Gipp, Rockne had an ideal handler of the forward pass, and a receiver in Bernard Kirk. The 1919 team went undefeated and were a national champion. Gipp died December 14, 1920 1920, just two weeks after being elected Notre Dame's first All-American by Walter Camp. Gipp likely contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game, November 20 against Northwestern University. Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited and they could be fatal even to young, healthy individuals.\nJohn Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10–1 record, suffering its only loss to Howard Jones coached and Aubrey Devine-led Iowa. Grantland Rice wrote that \"Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space\" and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team \"was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game\". Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.\nThe loss to Iowa snapped a 20-game winning streak for Rockne and Notre Dame, which would be the longest winning streak of Rockne's career. One of the criticisms fans had of the previous Iowa coach, Hawley, was that he could not convince talented Iowa players to play at Iowa. Jones succeeded in that respect; the 1921 Hawkeyes started 11 native Iowans. Despite the graduations of many key players, Iowa again posted a perfect 7–0 final record in 1922. Iowa again went 5–0 in the Big Ten, capturing its second straight Big Ten crown. It is the only time in Iowa history that the Hawkeyes have won consecutive conference titles.\nThe 1924 Irish featured the \"Four Horsemen\": Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden. The Irish capped an undefeated, 10–0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl. Stanford's Ernie Nevers played all 60 minutes in the game and rushed for 114 yards, more yardage than all the Four Horsemen combined.\nIn 1927, Rockne's complex shifts led directly to a rule change whereby all offensive players had to stop for a full second before the ball could be snapped. On November 10, 1928, when the \"Fighting Irish\" team was losing to Army 6–0 at the end of the half, Rockne entered the locker room and told the team the words he heard on Gipp's deathbed in 1920: \"I've got to go, Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it, and I'll be happy.\" This inspired the team, which then outscored Army in the second half and won the game 12–6. The phrase \"Win one for the Gipper\" was later used as a political slogan by Ronald Reagan, who in 1940 portrayed Gipp in \"Knute Rockne, All American\". The 1929 and 1930 Notre Dame teams were also declared national champions.\nMichigan and Illinois.\nBernard Kirk transferred to Michigan in 1920, and died in a car wreck after being selected All-American in 1922. Michigan won a national title in 1923, led by the likes of Harry Kipke and Jack Blott. In 1925, Benny Friedman to Bennie Oosterbaan proved one of the sport's great pass-receiver combinations. Yost proclaimed the 1925 team his greatest.\nAlso in 1923, Red Grange burst on the scene at Illinois. Grange then vaulted to national prominence as a result of his performance in the October 18, 1924, game against Michigan. This was the grand opening game for the new Memorial Stadium, built as a memorial to University of Illinois students and alumni who had served in World War I. The Michigan Wolverines were going for the national championship. He returned the opening kickoff for a 95-yard touchdown and scored three more touchdowns on runs of 67, 56, and 44 yards in the first 12 minutes–the last three in less than seven minutes. On his next carry, he ran 56 yards for yet another touchdown. Before the game was over, Grange ran back another kickoff for yet another touchdown. He scored six touchdowns in all. Illinois won the game by a lopsided score of 39 to 14.\nThe game inspired Grantland Rice to write this poetic description:\nOhio State.\nChic Harley was Ohio State's first All-American in his freshman year, who in his senior year led the team to its first victory over arch-rival Michigan. In 1941, James Thurber described Harley's running skills for the New York City newspaper, \"PM\", \"If you never saw him run with a football, I can't describe it to you. It wasn't like Red Grange or Tom Harmon or anybody else. It was kind of a cross between music and cannon fire, and it brought your heart up under your ears.\" The OSU Marching Band has changed its script \"Ohio\" formation to spell \"Chic\" on several occasions, including a Michigan game where Harley was in attendance.\nSouth.\nFuzzy Woodruff claims Davidson was the first in the south to throw a legal forward pass in 1906.\nVanderbilt.\nIn 1906 Vanderbilt defeated Carlisle 4 to 0, the result of a Bob Blake field goal, and the south's \"crowning feat\". In 1907 Vanderbilt fought Navy to a 6 to 6 tie. That same season saw Vanderbilt execute a double pass play to set up the touchdown that beat conference-rival Sewanee in a meeting of unbeatens for the SIAA championship. Grantland Rice cited this event as the greatest thrill he ever witnessed in his years of watching sports. Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin in \"Spalding's Football Guide\" summation of the season in the SIAA wrote \"The standing. First, Vanderbilt; second, Sewanee, a might good second;\" and that Aubrey Lanier \"came near winning the Vanderbilt game by his brilliant dashes after receiving punts.\" Bob Blake threw the final pass to center Stein Stone, catching it near the goal amongst defenders. Honus Craig then ran in the winning touchdown.\nIn 1910 Vanderbilt held defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie, the south's first great triumph against an Eastern power.\nIn 1922, Vanderbilt fought Michigan to a scoreless tie at the inaugural game on Dudley Field, the first stadium in the South made exclusively for college football. Michigan coach Fielding Yost and Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin were brothers-in-law, and the latter the protege of the former. The game featured the season's two best defenses and included a goal line stand by Vanderbilt to preserve the tie. Its result was \"a great surprise to the sporting world\". Commodore fans celebrated by throwing some 3,000 seat cushions onto the field. The game features prominently in Vanderbilt's history.\nGeorgia Tech.\nUtilizing the \"jump shift\" offense, John Heisman's Georgia Tech Golden Tornado won 222 to 0 over Cumberland on October 7, 1916, at Grant Field in the most lopsided victory in college football history. Tech went on a 33-game winning streak during this period. The 1917 team was the first national champion from the South, led by a powerful backfield of Joe Guyon, Everett Strupper, Albert Hill, and Judy Harlan. It had the first two players from the Deep South selected first-team All-American in Strupper and tackle Walker Carpenter. Strupper, aside from his quickness, overcame deafness and handled the signals like a regular quarterback. He could also read a defender's lips. Pop Warner's Pittsburgh Panthers were also undefeated, but declined a challenge by Heisman to a game. When Heisman left Tech after 1919, his shift was still employed by protege William Alexander.\nHelping Georgia Tech's claim to a title in 1917, the Auburn Tigers held undefeated, Chic Harley-led Big Ten champion Ohio State to a scoreless tie the week before Georgia Tech beat the Tigers 68 to 7. The next season, with many players gone due to World War I, a game was finally scheduled at Forbes Field with Pittsburgh. The Panthers, led by freshman Tom Davies, defeated Georgia Tech 32 to 0, hurting the south's chances at recognition for many years. Despite this, Tech center Bum Day was the first player on a Southern team ever selected first-team All-American by Walter Camp.\nCentre.\n1917 saw the rise of another Southern team in Centre of Danville, Kentucky. In 1919, Centre went undefeated and defeated West Virginia. Bo McMillin and Red Weaver were consensus All-America. In 1921, McMillin-led Centre upset defending national champion Harvard 6 to 0 in what is widely considered one of the greatest upsets in college football history.\nVanderbilt's line coach in the undefeated seasons of 1921 and 1922 was Wallace Wade, a graduate of Brown who ran interference for Pollard. He accepted the job at Alabama the season after Alabama upset Penn 9 to 7.\n\"Game that changed the south\".\nIn 1925, Wade coached Alabama to the south's first Rose Bowl victory. That Rose Bowl game is commonly referred to as \"the game that changed the south\". Wade followed up the 1926 season with an undefeated record and Rose Bowl tie. Wade's Alabama again won a national championship and Rose Bowl in 1930.\n1925 also saw the widespread use of the forward pass in the south for the first time. By 1927, Vanderbilt's Bill Spears led the nation in passing. That same season, Georgia's \"dream and wonder team\" defeated Yale for the first time 14–10. Georgia Tech, led by Heisman protege William Alexander, gave the \"dream and wonder team\" its only loss. The next season Tech won the Rose Bowl, including Roy Riegels' wrong-way run, and were declared national champions. On October 12, 1929, Yale lost to Georgia in Sanford Stadium in its first trip to the south.\nRobert Neyland was hired by Tennessee in 1926, expressly to beat Vanderbilt. After losing to Vanderbilt in his first season, Neyland lost just a single contest from 1927 to 1932, to Wade's 1930 Alabama team.\nSouthwest.\nThe forward pass was brought to the southwest by former Vanderbilt star and SMU coach Ray Morrison. Gerald Mann was his most notable passer.\nPacific coast.\nIn 1906, citing concerns about the violence in American Football, universities on the West Coast, led by California and Stanford, replaced the sport with rugby union. At the time, the future of American football was very much in doubt and these schools believed that rugby union would eventually be adopted nationwide. Other schools followed suit and also made the switch included Nevada, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and USC (in 1911). However, due to the perception that West Coast football was inferior to the game played on the East Coast anyway, East Coast and Midwest teams shrugged off the loss of the teams and continued playing American football. With no nationwide movement, the available pool of rugby teams to play remained small. The schools scheduled games against local club teams and reached out to rugby union powers in Australia, New Zealand, and especially, due to its proximity, Canada. The annual Big Game between Stanford and California continued as rugby, with the winner invited by the British Columbia Rugby Union to a tournament in Vancouver over the Christmas holidays, with the winner of that tournament receiving the Cooper Keith Trophy.\nStanford.\nDuring 12 seasons of playing rugby union, Stanford was remarkably successful: the team had three undefeated seasons, three one-loss seasons, and an overall record of 94 wins, 20 losses, and 3 ties for a winning percentage of .816. However, after a few years, the school began to feel the isolation of its newly adopted sport, which was not spreading as many had hoped. Students and alumni began to clamor for a return to American football to allow wider intercollegiate competition. The onset of World War I gave Stanford an out: in 1918, the Stanford campus was designated as the Students' Army Training Corps headquarters for all of California, Nevada, and Utah, and the commanding officer, Sam M. Parker, decreed that American football was the appropriate athletic activity to train soldiers and rugby union was dropped.\nCal.\nThe pressure at rival California was stronger (especially as the school had not been as successful in the Big Game as they had hoped), and in 1915 California returned to American football. As reasons for the change, the school cited rule change back to American football, the overwhelming desire of students and supporters to play American football, interest in playing other East Coast and Midwest schools, and a patriotic desire to play an \"American\" game. California's return to American football increased the pressure on Stanford to also change back in order to maintain the rivalry. Stanford played its 1915, 1916, and 1917 \"Big Games\" as rugby union against Santa Clara and California's football \"Big Game\" in those years was against Washington, but both schools desired to restore the old traditions. From 1920 to 1924, California's \"Wonder Teams\" went undefeated with three claimed national titles in a row. The 1921 Rose Bowl between Cal and Ohio State drew some of the first national attention for a use of the forward pass when Cal end Harold Muller completed a 53-yard pass to Brodie Stephens. The next year's Rose Bowl featured a controversial, scoreless tie between Cal and Washington &amp; Jefferson. The 1922 Cal team went undefeated and led the major colleges in scoring with 398 points.\nUSC.\nHoward Jones arrived at USC in 1925. Heading into the 1930 Rose Bowl, USC had defeated its crosstown rival UCLA 76–0 in their first meeting.\nMissouri Valley.\nOn November 25, 1911 Kansas and Missouri played the first homecoming football game. The game was \"broadcast\" play-by-play over telegraph to at least 1,000 fans in Lawrence, Kansas. It ended in a 3–3 tie.\nInnovators and Motivators (1894–1932).\nAlthough Walter Camp is widely considered to have been the \"Father of American football\", the development of the game was collaborative in nature and many different people contributed to the early development of the game.\nParke H. Davis.\nParke H. Davis played lineman at Princeton for one year in 1889 and then later coached at Wisconsin (1893), Amherst (1894) and Lafayette (1895–98), where he also served as athletic director.\nHe led Lafayette to a National Championship in 1896 on the coattails of his star player, Fielding Yost. Later he also served on the Rules Committee from 1909 to 1915, playing a key role in shaping the evolution of the game. Among the innovations with which he is credited are the division of the game into quarters, numbering of players, abolition of inter-locked interference and the creation of end zones. In 1911, he wrote a book on the early history of American football entitled \"Football, the American collegiate game\". This book remains an important source of information on the early development of American football. He also authored articles on American football for the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" and compiled a glossary of American football terms.\nAmos Alonzo Stagg.\nAmos Alonzo Stagg played under Walter Camp as an end and divinity student at Yale University and coached the University of Chicago to prominence. Stagg is arguably the sport's greatest innovator. Among a long list, his most famous and lasting inventions include trick plays such as the end-around and the Statue of Liberty, maneuvers such as shifts and motion, equipment such as hip pads, and the first book on football with diagrams. Stagg coached football until the age of 96 and later died at the age of 102 in 1965. A famous story of Stagg from his older days tells how he would keep his front lawn in immaculate shape, so that the kids living in his neighborhood would have a good surface to play football on.\nJohn Heisman.\nJohn Heisman served as the head football coach at Oberlin College (1892, 1894), Buchtel College—now known as the University of Akron (1893–1894), Auburn University (1895–1899), Clemson University (1900–1903), Georgia Tech (1904–1919), the University of Pennsylvania (1920–1922), Washington &amp; Jefferson College (1923), and Rice University (1924–1927), compiling a career college football record of 186–70–18 with a National Championship in 1917 while at Georgia Tech. Heisman had an extensive vocabulary, and in the offseason was a Shakespearean actor. He was known to begin each season by saying to his freshmen; \"What is this? It is a prolate spheroid, an elongated sphere in which the outer leather casing is drawn tightly over a somewhat smaller rubber tubing. Better to have died as a small boy than to fumble this football.\" He was an innovator and developed one of the first shifts, had both guards pull to lead an end run, and had his center toss the ball back, instead of rolling or kicking it. He was one of the strongest proponents for the legalization of the forward pass in 1906 and he originated the \"hike\" or \"hep\" shouted by the quarterback to start each play. The Heisman Memorial Trophy was named after him, and is now given to the player voted as the season's most outstanding collegiate football player.\nWilliam H. Lewis.\nFollowing his graduation at Harvard law school, William H. Lewis was hired as a football coach at Harvard, where he served from 1895 to 1906. During his coaching tenure, the team had a combined record of 114–15–5. Lewis also developed a reputation as one of the most knowledgeable experts on the game. In 1896, Lewis wrote one of the first books on American football, \"A Primer of College Football\", published by Harper &amp; Brothers, and serialized by \"Harper's Weekly\".\nFielding \"Hurry Up\" Yost.\nFielding H. Yost's biggest contribution was building the first traditional midwestern power at the University of Michigan. He first played at West Virginia University as a law student. Yost became a remarkable personification of \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.\" He transferred in mid-season to join Coach Parke H. Davis's national championship team at Lafayette. Just a week after playing \"against\" Davis in West Virginia, Yost was playing \"for\" Davis in Lafayette's historic 6–4 win over the Penn Quakers. Yost utilized a short punt system. In the early days of the sport the ball was often moved up the field, not through offensive plays, but rather through punting. Once the opposing team got the ball, the defense was relied upon to make the other team's offense lose yards or fumble. To confuse the opponent and attain longer punts, the punting was often done on first or second downs and it was not uncommon for a team to kick more than 40 times in a game. Yost also invented the position of linebacker; co-created the first ever bowl game, the 1902 Rose Bowl, with then legendary UM athletic director Charles Baird; invented the fieldhouse concept that bears his name; and supervised the building of the first on-campus building dedicated to intramural sports. Yost retired in 1926.\nEddie Cochems.\nEddie Cochems was the head football coach at North Dakota State (1902–1903), Clemson (1905), Saint Louis University (1906–1908), and Maine (1914). During his three years at St. Louis, he was the first American football coach to build an offense around the forward pass, which became a legal play in the 1906 college football season. Using the forward pass, Cochems' 1906 team compiled an undefeated 11–0 record, led the nation in scoring, and outscored opponents by a combined score of 407 to 11. He is considered by some to be the \"father of the forward pass\" in American football. Knute Rockne biographer, Ray Robinson, wrote, \"The St. Louis style of forward pass, as implemented by Cochems, was different from the pass being thrown by eastern players. Cochems did not protect his receiver by surrounding him with teammates, as was the case in the East.\" After the 1906 season, Cochems published a 10-page article entitled \"The Forward Pass and On-Side Kick\" in the 1907 edition of Spalding's \"How to Play Foot Ball\" (edited by Walter Camp). Cochems explained in words and photographs (of Robinson) how the forward pass could be thrown and how passing skills could be developed. \"[T]he necessary brevity of this article will not permit of a detailed discussion of the forward pass\", Cochems lamented. \"Should I begin to explain the different plays in which the pass ... could figure, I would invite myself to an endless task.\" In a 1932 interview with a Wisconsin sports columnist, Cochems claimed that Yale, Harvard and Princeton (the so-called \"Big Three\" football powers in the early decades of the sport) all called him in having him explain the forward pass to them.\nHenry L. Williams.\nWilliams built the University of Minnesota into a power and developed a famous shift. It was the forerunner to all quick shifts in American football.\nGlenn \"Pop\" Warner.\nGlenn \"Pop\" Warner coached at several schools throughout his career, including the University of Georgia, Cornell University, University of Pittsburgh, Stanford University, and Temple University. One of his most famous stints was at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, where he coached Jim Thorpe, who went on to become the first president of the National Football League, an Olympic Gold Medalist, and is widely considered one of the best overall athletes in history. Warner wrote one of the first important books of football strategy, \"Football for Coaches and Players\", published in 1927. Though the shift was invented by Stagg, Warner's single wing and double wing formations greatly improved upon it; for almost 40 years, these were among the most important formations in football. As part of his single and double wing formations, Warner was one of the first coaches to effectively utilize the forward pass. Among his other innovations are modern blocking schemes, shoulder pads, and the three-point stance. The youth football league, Pop Warner Little Scholars, was named in his honor.\nRobert Zuppke.\nRobert Zuppke built the University of Illinois into a power and was a noted innovator. Zuppke led his teams to four national championships in 1914, 1919, 1923, and 1927. Zuppke served as the president of the American Football Coaches Association in 1925. Zuppke is credited for many football inventions and traditions, including the huddle and the flea flicker. He was also a painter and known for his aphoristic remarks called \"Zuppkeisms\".\nDan McGugin.\nDan McGugin played at Drake University and under Fielding Yost as a guard and punter on the \"point-a-minute\" Michigan teams. He brought Vanderbilt University to prominence as a southern power ever since his first year as a head coach. Sportswriter Fuzzy Woodruff once wrote \"The plain facts of the business are that McGugin stood out in the South like Gulliver among the native sons of Lilliput. There was no foeman worthy of the McGugin steel;\" and Fred Russell wrote \"For years he ruled supreme in Dixie, and his teams won many glorious intersectional victories. More than any one man, he was responsible for the progress of southern football ... He was the first coach to successfully work the onside kick. He was among the first to have his guards pull ... His name will never die.\" Grantland Rice said of McGugin: \"I have known a long parade of football coaches ... but I have never met one who combined more of the qualities needed to make a great coach.\" The Vanderbilt athletics office building, the McGugin Center, bears his name, and McGugin was an inaugural inductee into the College Football Hall of Fame. McGugin retired in 1934, and died in January 1936.\nGil Dobie.\n\"Gloomy Gil\" Dobie was an inaugural inductee into the College Football Hall of Fame and led Cornell University to three straight national titles and a 26-game winning streak; he also coached at the University of Washington and never lost a game, including a 39-game winning streak. He was known as \"gloomy\" since he was given to pessimistic predictions about his teams.\nDana X. Bible.\nDana X. Bible won titles at Texas A&amp;M University as well as brought the University of Texas to prominence. Bible's 1919 Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team, which was undefeated, untied, and outscored its opposition 275–0, was retroactively named a national champion by the Billingsley Report and the National Championship Foundation. While at Texas, University of Chicago coach Clark Shaughnessy contacted Bible to organize a clinic on the T formation. Along with Frank Leahy of Notre Dame, they helped create the T formation revolution. Bible served on the National Collegiate Football Rules Committee for 25 years, and was president of the American Football Coaches Association.\nAndy Smith.\nAndy Smith coached the \"Wonder Teams\" of the University of California, Berkeley which from 1920 to 1924 went undefeated, running up a record of 44–0–2 and winning three NCAA-recognized national championships. The 1920 Rose Bowl winning team outscored its opponents 510 to 14. Smith was an inaugural inductee into the College Football Hall of Fame. In 1960, the respected Helms Athletic Foundation crowned the 1920 \"Wonder Team\", as the greatest American football team in history. The California Memorial Stadium is still known today as \"The House that Smith Built.\" Smith was famous for his defense-oriented strategy of \"Kick and wait for the breaks\". Smith also became known for trick plays such as the halfback pass. At the time because of the plump, rugby-like ball, forward passes over 30 yards in length were unanticipated.\nHoward Jones.\nHoward Jones led his alma mater Yale to a national title, the Iowa Hawkeyes to two undefeated seasons, and the USC Trojans to four national titles and five Rose Bowl victories. Along with Smith, Jones vies for the title of greatest coach of the era on the Pacific Coast. Jones was known for being completely absorbed in the sport and aloof outside of it. USC historian Al Wesson remarks \"Howard lived and breathed football. If it were not for football, he would have starved to death – couldn't possibly have made a living in business.\" Jones was an inaugural inductee into the College Football Hall of Fame.\nKnute Rockne.\nKnute Rockne rose to prominence in 1913 as an end and chemistry student for the University of Notre Dame, then a largely unknown Midwestern Catholic school. Rockne returned to coach the team in 1918, and devised the powerful Notre Dame Box offense, based on Warner's single wing. He is credited with being the first major coach to emphasize offense over defense. Rockne is also credited with popularizing and perfecting the forward pass, a seldom used play at the time. Rather than simply a regional team, Rockne's \"Fighting Irish\" became famous for barnstorming and played any team at any location. It was during Rockne's tenure that the annual Notre Dame-University of Southern California rivalry began. He led his team to a 105–12–5 record before his premature death in a plane crash in 1931. He was so famous at that point that his funeral was broadcast nationally on radio. His biography at the College Football Hall of Fame calls him \"without question, American football's most-renowned coach.\"\nEarly history of professional football (1892–1932).\nEarly players, teams, and leagues (1892–1919).\nIn the early 20th century, football began to catch on in the general population of the United States and was the subject of intense competition and rivalry, albeit of a localized nature. Although payments to players were considered unsporting and dishonorable at the time, a Pittsburgh area club, the Allegheny Athletic Association, of the unofficial western Pennsylvania football circuit, surreptitiously hired former Yale All-American guard Pudge Heffelfinger. On November 12, 1892, Heffelfinger became the first known professional football player. He was paid $500 to play in a game against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Heffelfinger picked up a Pittsburgh fumble and ran 35 yards for a touchdown, winning the game 4–0 for Allegheny. Although observers held suspicions, the payment remained a secret for years.\nOn September 3, 1895, the first wholly professional game was played, in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, between the Latrobe Athletic Association and the Jeannette Athletic Club. Latrobe won the contest 12–0. During this game, Latrobe's quarterback, John Brallier became the first player to openly admit to being paid to play football. He was paid $10 plus expenses to play. In 1897, the Latrobe Athletic Association paid all of its players for the whole season, becoming the first fully professional football team. In 1898, William Chase Temple took over the team payments for the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, a professional football team based in Pittsburgh from 1895 until 1900, becoming the first known individual football club owner. Later that year, the Morgan Athletic Club, on the South Side of Chicago, was founded. This team later became the Chicago Cardinals, then the St. Louis Cardinals and now is known as the Arizona Cardinals, making them the oldest continuously operating professional football team.\nThe first known professional football league, known as the National Football League (not the same as the modern league) began play in 1902 when several baseball clubs formed football teams to play in the league, including the Philadelphia Athletics, Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies. The Pirates' team the Pittsburgh Stars were awarded the league championship. However, the Philadelphia Football Athletics and Philadelphia Football Phillies also claimed the title. A five-team tournament, known as the World Series of Football was organized by Tom O'Rouke, the manager of Madison Square Garden. The event featured the first-ever indoor pro football games. The first professional indoor game came on December 29, 1902, when the Syracuse Athletic Club defeated the \"New York team\" 5–0. Syracuse would go on to win the 1902 Series, while the Franklin Athletic Club won the Series in 1903. The World Series only lasted two seasons.\nThe game moved west into Ohio, which became the center of professional football during the early decades of the 20th century. Small towns such as Massillon, Akron, Portsmouth, and Canton all supported professional teams in a loose coalition known as the \"Ohio League\", the direct predecessor to today's National Football League. In 1906 the Canton Bulldogs–Massillon Tigers betting scandal became the first major scandal in professional football in the United States. It was the first known case of professional gamblers attempting to fix a professional sport. Although the Massillon Tigers could not prove that the Canton Bulldogs had thrown the second game, the scandal tarnished the Bulldogs' name and helped ruin professional football in Ohio until the mid-1910s.\nIn 1915, the reformed Canton Bulldogs signed former Olympian and Carlisle Indian School standout Jim Thorpe to a contract. Thorpe became the face of professional football for the next several years and was present at the founding of the National Football League five years later. A disruption in play in 1918 (due to World War I and flu pandemic) allowed the New York Pro Football League to pick up some of the Ohio League's talent; the NYPFL had coalesced around 1916, but efforts to challenge the Ohio teams were largely unsuccessful until after the suspension. By 1919, the Ohio League and the New York league were on relatively equal footing with both each other and with teams clustered around major cities such as Philadelphia, Chicago and Detroit.\nEarly years of the NFL (1920–1932).\nFormation.\nThe 1919 expansion of top-level professional football threatened to drastically increase the cost of the game by sparking bidding wars. The various regional circuits determined that forming a league, with enforceable rules, would mitigate these problems.\nIn 1920, the American Professional Football Conference was founded, in a meeting at a Hupmobile car dealership in Canton, Ohio. Jim Thorpe was elected the league's first president. Initially the new league consisted only of the Ohio League teams, although some of the teams declined participation. After several more meetings, the league's membership was formalized. One month later on September 17, the league was renamed the American Professional Football Association, adding Buffalo and Rochester from the New York league, and Detroit, Hammond (a suburban Chicago squad), and several other teams from nearby circuits. The original teams were:\nIn its early years the league was little more than a formal agreement between teams to play each other and to declare a champion at season's end. Teams were still permitted to play non-league members. The 1920 season saw several teams drop out and fail to play through their schedule. Only four teams: Akron, Buffalo, Canton, and Decatur, finished the schedule. Akron claimed the first league champion, with the only undefeated record among the remaining teams.\nFrom its inception in as a loose coalition of various regional teams, the American Professional Football Association had comparatively few African-American players; a total of nine black people suited up for NFL teams between 1920 and 1926, including future attorney, black activist, and internationally acclaimed artist Paul Robeson. Fritz Pollard and Bobby Marshall were the first black players in what is now the NFL in 1920. Pollard became the first black coach in 1921 and the first black quarterback in NFL in 1923.\nExpansion.\nIn 1921, several more teams joined the league, increasing the membership to 22 teams. Among the new additions were the Green Bay Packers, which now has the record for longest use of an unchanged team name. Also in 1921, A. E. Staley, the owner of the Decatur Staleys, sold the team to player-coach George Halas, who went on to become one of the most important figures in the first half century of the NFL. In 1921, Halas moved the team to Chicago, but retained the Staleys nickname. In 1922 the team was renamed the Chicago Bears. The Staleys won the 1921 AFPA Championship, over the Buffalo All-Americans in an event later referred to as the \"Staley Swindle\". The APFA was renamed National Football League on June 24, 1922.\nBy the mid-1920s, NFL membership had grown to 25 teams, and a rival league known as the American Football League was formed. The rival AFL folded after a single season, but it symbolized a growing interest in the professional game. Several college stars joined the NFL, most notably Red Grange from the University of Illinois, who was taken on a famous barnstorming tour in 1925 by the Chicago Bears. Another scandal that season centered on a 1925 game between the Chicago Cardinals and the Milwaukee Badgers. The scandal involved a Chicago player, Art Folz, hiring a group of high school football players to play for the Milwaukee Badgers, against the Cardinals. This would ensure an inferior opponent for Chicago. The game was used to help prop up their win–loss percentage and as a chance of wrestling away the 1925 Championship away from the first place Pottsville Maroons. All parties were severely punished initially; however, a few months later the punishments were rescinded. Also that year a controversial dispute stripped the NFL title from the Maroons and awarded it to the Cardinals.\nThe first evidence of women playing organized American football was in 1926, when the Frankford Yellow Jackets (the predecessors to the modern Philadelphia Eagles) employed women's teams for halftime entertainment.\n1932 NFL playoff game.\nAt the end of the 1932 season, the Chicago Bears and the Portsmouth Spartans were tied with the best regular-season records. To determine the champion, the league voted to hold its first playoff game. Because of cold weather, the game was held indoors at Chicago Stadium, which forced some temporary rule changes. Chicago won, 9–0. The playoff proved so popular that the league reorganized into two divisions for the 1933 season, with the winners advancing to a scheduled championship game. A number of new rule changes were also instituted: the goal posts were moved forward to the goal line, every play started from between the hash marks, and forward passes could originate from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage (instead of the previous five yards behind).\nEarly history of youth and high school football (1863–1932).\nThe 1863 games of the Oneida Football Club were the first high school football games to be played in the United States. Thirteen of the sixteen Oneida players attended Epes Sargent Dixwell's Private Latin School, which later became Noble and Greenough School, which was located near the Boston Common.\nThe oldest high school football rivalry in the United States is between Norwich Free Academy and New London High School. The first meeting between Norwich Free Academy and New London High School occurred on May 12, 1875. Wellesley High School and Needham High School began playing each other in 1882 in what is now the oldest football rivalry in the United States between public schools. In 1887, Boston Latin School and English High School began playing each other in what is now the oldest continuous football rivalry in the United States. Hyde Park Career Academy and Englewood Technical Prep Academy began playing each other for the Little Brown Shield in 1889. The \"Bell Game\" between Pueblo Central High School and Pueblo Centennial High School, which was first played in 1892, is noted as being the oldest high school football rivalry west of the Mississippi River.\nAmerican football came to Massillon, Ohio in 1894 with the first high school game between Massillon Washington High School and Canton Central High School. In the early years, the players consisted of working boys because most boys did not attend high school. By 1904 more boys began attending school past 8th grade. 1909 was Massillon's first undefeated football team. From 1910 to 1920 high school football in Massillon grew and improved, and by 1916 they were named the Scholastic Champions of Ohio. The school mascot, the Tiger, was adopted from the city's former professional football team known as the Massillon Tigers.\nAmerican football first came to Green Bay, Wisconsin when Green Bay East High School and Green Bay West High School began their rivalry in 1895. Future founder of the Green Bay Packers, Curly Lambeau, became the captain of East High School's football team as a senior in 1917 and later coached the team from 1919 to 1921. Early games occasionally had more fans than Packers games, who used to play at City Stadium. Other notable players include Arnie Herber and Jim Crowley.\nEarly history of American football outside the United States (1874–1932).\nThe first American football game played outside of the United States was the October 23, 1874, game between McGill and Harvard played at Montreal Cricket Grounds. American football in Europe first began with the 1897 École des Beaux-Arts vs. Académie Julian football game. American football was first played in Cuba was on December 25, 1907, between LSU and the University of Havana. American football was held as a demonstration sport for the 1932 Summer Olympics.\nSimilar codes of football.\nOther codes of football share a common history with American football. Canadian football is a form of the game that evolved parallel to American football, through its adoption of the Burnside rules in 1903. While both games share a common history and basic structure, there are some important differences between the two.\nAmerican football's parent sport of rugby continued to evolve. Today, two distinct codes known as rugby union and rugby league are played throughout the world. Since the two codes split following a schism on how the sport should be managed in 1895, the history of rugby league and the history of rugby union have evolved separately. Both codes have adopted innovations parallel to the American game; the rugby union scoring system is almost identical to the American game, while rugby league uses a gridiron-style field and a six-tackle rule similar to the system of downs in American Football."

        "title": "Modern history of American football",
        "text": "The modern history of American football can be considered to have begun after the 1932 NFL Playoff Game, which was the first American football game to feature hash marks, the legalization of the forward pass anywhere behind the line of scrimmage, and the movement of the goal posts back to the goal line; it was also the first indoor game since 1902. Other innovations to occur in the years after 1932 were the introduction of the AP Poll in 1934, the tapering of the ends of the football in 1934, the awarding of the first Heisman Trophy in 1935, the first NFL draft in 1936, and the first televised game in 1939. \nAnother important event was the American football game at the 1932 Summer Olympics, which combined with a similar demonstration game at the 1933 World's Fair, led to the first College All-Star Game in 1934, which in turn was an important factor in the growth of professional football in the United States. American football's explosion in popularity during the second half of the 20th century can be traced to the 1958 NFL Championship Game, a contest that has been dubbed the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\". A rival league to the NFL, the American Football League (AFL), began play in 1960. In 1966, the NFL initiated the AFL–NFL merger between the two leagues. The merger lead to the creation of the Super Bowl, which has become the most watched television event in the United States on an annual basis.\nModern history of intercollegiate football (1933–present).\nModernization of intercollegiate American football (1933–1969).\nIn the early 1930s, the college game continued to grow, particularly in the South, bolstered by fierce rivalries such as the \"South's Oldest Rivalry\", between Virginia and North Carolina and the \"Deep South's Oldest Rivalry\", between Georgia and Auburn. Although before the mid-1920s most national powers came from the Northeast or the Midwest, the trend changed when several teams from the South and the West Coast achieved national success. Wallace William Wade's 1925 Alabama team won the 1926 Rose Bowl after receiving its first national title and William Alexander's 1928 Georgia Tech team defeated California in the 1929 Rose Bowl. College football quickly became the most popular spectator sport in the South.\nSeveral major modern college football conferences rose to prominence during this time period. The Southwest Athletic Conference had been founded in 1915. Consisting mostly of schools from Texas, the conference saw back-to-back national champions with Texas Christian University (TCU) in 1938 and Texas A&amp;M in 1939. The Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), a precursor to the contemporary Pac-12 Conference, had its own back-to-back champion in the University of Southern California which was awarded the title in 1931 and 1932. The Southeastern Conference (SEC) formed in 1932 and consisted mostly of schools in the Deep South. As in previous decades, the Big Ten continued to dominate in the 1930s and 1940s, with Minnesota winning 5 titles between 1934 and 1941, and Michigan (1933, 1947, and 1948) and Ohio State (1942) also winning titles.\nAs it grew beyond its regional affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu of an actual national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant regions of the country that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, the final version of the AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.\nThe 1930s saw growth in the passing game. Though some coaches, such as General Robert Neyland at Tennessee, continued to eschew its use, several rules changes to the game had a profound effect on teams' ability to throw the ball. In 1934, the rules committee removed two major penalties—a loss of five yards for a second incomplete pass in any series of downs and a loss of possession for an incomplete pass in the end zone—and shrunk the circumference of the ball, making it easier to grip and throw. Players who became famous for taking advantage of the easier passing game included Alabama end Don Hutson and TCU passer \"Slingin\" Sammy Baugh.\nIn 1935, New York City's Downtown Athletic Club awarded the first Heisman Trophy to University of Chicago halfback Jay Berwanger, who was also the first ever NFL Draft pick in 1936. The trophy was designed by sculptor Frank Eliscu and modeled after New York University player Ed Smith. The trophy recognizes the nation's \"most outstanding\" college football player and has become one of the most coveted awards in all of American sports.\nNBC broadcast the first televised college football game ever, which was between Waynesburg and Fordham on September 30, 1939, on station W2XBS with one camera and Bill Stern was the sole announcer. Estimates are that the broadcast reached approximately 1,000 television sets.\nCollege football on television continued with the second televised college game just one month later, on October 28, when the Kansas State Wildcats hosted the Nebraska Cornhuskers for their homecoming contest.\nPrior to 1941, virtually all football players saw action on \"both sides of the ball\", playing in both offensive and defensive roles. From 1941 to 1952, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) allowed unlimited substitution. This change was originally made because of the difficulty in fielding highly skilled players during the years of the Second World War, in which many able-bodied college-age men volunteered for or were drafted into military service. During World War II, college football players enlisted in the armed forces, some playing in Europe during the war. As most of these players had eligibility left on their college careers, some of them returned to college at West Point, bringing Army back-to-back national titles in 1944 and 1945 under coach Red Blaik. Doc Blanchard (known as \"Mr. Inside\") and Glenn Davis (known as \"Mr. Outside\") both won the Heisman Trophy, in 1945 and 1946 respectively. On the coaching staff of those 1944–1946 Army teams was future Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Vince Lombardi.\nThe 1950s saw the rise of yet more dynasties and power programs. Oklahoma, under coach Bud Wilkinson, won three national titles (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten Big Eight Conference championships in the decade while building a record 47-game winning streak. Woody Hayes led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and dominated the Big Ten conference, winning three Big Ten titles—more than any other school. Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw a revival of the running game in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped from an average of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title. Paul Hornung, Notre Dame quarterback, did, however, win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team ever to do so.\nIn 1954, the NCAA emplaced a set of new rules ending free substitution, and thus requiring the use of the one-platoon system, primarily due to financial reasons. The system allowed only one player to be substituted between plays, which effectively put an end to the use of separate specialized units. Tennessee head coach \"General\" Robert Neyland praised the change as the end of \"chickenshit football\".\nFollowing the enormous success of the National Football League's 1958 championship game, college football no longer enjoyed the same popularity as the NFL, at least on a national level. While both games benefited from the advent of television, since the late 1950s, the NFL has become a nationally popular sport while college football has maintained strong regional ties.\nAs professional football became a national television phenomenon, college football did as well. In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, but by and large the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act; the Supreme Court ruled against the NCAA and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. ABC Sports began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.\nNew formations and play sets continued to be developed. Emory Bellard, an assistant coach under Darrell Royal at the University of Texas, developed a three-back option style offense known as the wishbone. The wishbone is a run-heavy offense that depends on the quarterback making last second decisions on when and to whom to hand or pitch the ball to. Royal went on to teach the offense to other coaches, including Bear Bryant at Alabama, Chuck Fairbanks at Oklahoma and Pepper Rodgers at UCLA; who all adapted and developed it to their own tastes. The strategic opposite of the wishbone is the spread offense, developed by professional and college coaches throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Though some schools play a run-based version of the spread, its most common use is as a passing offense designed to \"spread\" the field both horizontally and vertically. Some teams have managed to adapt with the times to keep winning consistently. In the rankings of the most victorious programs, Michigan, Texas, and Notre Dame are ranked first, second, and third in total wins.\nAfter the 1964 season, twelve years since the mandate requiring one-platoon, the NCAA repealed the rules enforcing its use and allowed an unlimited amount of player substitutions. This allowed, starting with the 1965 season, teams to form separate offensive and defensive units as well as \"special teams\" which would be employed in kicking situations. The reinstatement of the two-platoon system allowed players to become more specialized by focusing on a limited number of plays and skills related to their specific position. By the early 1970s, however, some university administrators, coaches and others were calling for a return to the days of one-platoon football.\nThe 1969 college football season was celebrated as the 100th anniversary of college football. Many schools, at the behest of the NCAA, commemorated the 1969 season by wearing a special decal on their football helmets. The decal consisted of the numeral \"100\" inside a football shaped outline. The decal was designed to commemorate the 1869 game between Rutgers and Princeton, often cited as the first college football game. Decals varied greatly from one team to another. Some teams placed the decals unobtrusively on the front or back of the helmet. Other teams placed them prominently on the side, either in addition to or in place of their regular team logo. Colors and design of the decals also varied greatly between teams; with different numeral styles and color schemes in use. One notable exception was Harvard, which abstained from the 1969 commemoration, and had its own special helmet decal made for the 1974 season, which commemorates an 1874 game that Harvard played against McGill that Harvard claims was the \"real\" first American football game.\nModern intercollegiate football (1970–present).\nGrowth of bowl games.\nIn 1940, for the highest level of college football, there were only five bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar, Sun, and Cotton). By 1950, three more had joined that number and in 1970, there were still only eight major college bowl games. The number grew to eleven in 1976. At the birth of cable television and cable sports networks like ESPN, there were fifteen bowls in 1980. With more national venues and increased available revenue, the bowls saw an explosive growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In the thirty years from 1950 to 1980, seven bowl games were added to the schedule. From 1980 to 2008, an additional 20 bowl games were added to the schedule. Some have criticized this growth, claiming that the increased number of games has diluted the significance of playing in a bowl game. Yet others have countered that the increased number of games has increased exposure and revenue for a greater number of schools, and see it as a positive development.\nWith the growth of bowl games, it became difficult to determine a national champion in a fair and equitable manner. As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a tie-in), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the Bowl Coalition, which attempted to arrange an annual No.1 versus No.2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences—the Pac-10 and Big Ten—meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition was replaced by the Bowl Alliance, which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national championship game to three—the Fiesta, Sugar, and Orange Bowls—and the participating conferences to five—the ACC, SEC, Southwest, Big Eight, and Big East. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the Big Ten, Pac-10, or the Rose Bowl, and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.\nBowl Championship Series (1998–2013).\nIn 1998, a new system was put into place called the Bowl Championship Series. For the first time, it included all major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-10, and SEC) and all four major bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta). The champions of these six conferences, along with two \"at-large\" selections, were invited to play in the four bowl games. Each year, one of the four bowl games served as a national championship game. Also, a complex system of human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule calculations was instituted to rank schools. Based on this ranking system, the No.1 and No.2 teams met each year in the national championship game. Traditional tie-ins were maintained for schools and bowls not part of the national championship. For example, in years when not a part of the national championship, the Rose Bowl still hosted the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions.\nThe system continued to change, as the formula for ranking teams was tweaked from year to year. At-large teams could be chosen from any of the Division I conferences, though only one selection—Utah in 2005—came from a non-BCS affiliated conference. Starting with the 2006 season, a fifth game—simply called the BCS National Championship Game—was added to the schedule, to be played at the site of one of the four BCS bowl games on a rotating basis, one week after the regular bowl game. This opened up the BCS to two additional at-large teams. Also, rules were changed to add the champions of five additional conferences (Conference USA, the Mid-American Conference, the Mountain West Conference, the Sun Belt Conference and the Western Athletic Conference), provided that said champion ranked in the top twelve in the final BCS rankings, or was within the top 16 of the BCS rankings and ranked higher than the champion of at least one of the \"BCS conferences\" (also known as \"AQ\" conferences, for Automatic Qualifying). Several times since this rule change was implemented, schools from non-AQ conferences played in BCS bowl games. In 2009, Boise State played TCU in the Fiesta Bowl, the first time two schools from non-BCS conferences played each other in a BCS bowl game. The final team from the non-AQ ranks to reach a BCS bowl game was Northern Illinois in 2012, which played in (and lost) the 2013 Orange Bowl.\nCollege Football Playoff (2014–present).\nDue to the intensification of the College football playoff debate after more than a decade of the sometimes disputable results of the BCS, the conference commissioners and Notre Dame's president voted to implement a Plus-One system which was to be called the College Football Playoff. The CFP is the annual postseason tournament for the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and just as its predecessors, has failed to receive sanctioning from the NCAA. The playoff began with the 2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season.\nThe CFP system is centered on six major bowl games played on or near New Year's Day, often called the \"New Year's Six\". Three pairs of games rotate annually as hosts of CFP semifinals. The champions of the so-called Power Five conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC) all receive guaranteed berths in one of the New Year's Six games, though not necessarily in the CFP semifinals. Notre Dame, a football independent but otherwise an ACC member, has its own arrangement for access to the New Year's Six should it meet specified criteria. A selection committee similar to those used by the NCAA basketball tournaments for men and women releases a weekly ranking concurrently with the AP Poll starting with the Monday after Week 10 of the season. After the completion of the regular season, the committee selects the four teams that will compete in the CFP semifinals and the at-large entries to the New Year's Six games. One of the at-large entries is reserved for the top-ranking champion of the so-called \"Group of Five\" conferences (American, Conference USA, MAC, Mountain West, Sun Belt). The semifinal winners advance to the College Football Playoff National Championship game. The first season of the new system was not without controversy, however, after TCU and Baylor (each with only one loss) both failed to receive the support of the College Football Playoff selection committee.\nModern history of professional football (1933–present).\nProfessional football (1933–1969).\nStability and growth of the NFL (1933–1957).\nThe 1930s represented an important time of transition for the NFL. League membership was fluid prior to the mid-1930s. 1936 was the first year where there were no franchise moves, prior to that year 51 teams had gone defunct. Also in 1936, the NFL instituted the first draft of college players. With the first ever draft selection, the Philadelphia Eagles picked Heisman Trophy winner Jay Berwanger, but he declined to play professionally. Also in that year, another AFL formed, but it also lasted only two seasons.\nAn NFL game was televised for the first time when NBC broadcast the October 22, 1939 Philadelphia Eagles at Brooklyn Dodgers game at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn (the Dodgers won 23-14). The experimental broadcast was broadcast only to viewers in New York and Albany; regular broadcasting of NFL games would not begin until 1951.\nThe football, itself, changed in 1934, with a rule change that tapered the ball at the ends more and reduced the size around the middle. This new, sleeker ball made it much easier to handle, particularly for passers.\nIn 1933, the last year of integration, the NFL had two black players, Joe Lillard and Ray Kemp. Both were gone by the end of the season: Lillard, due largely to his tendency to get into fights, was not invited back to the Chicago Cardinals despite in 1933 being responsible for almost half of the Cardinals' points, while Kemp quit on his own accord to pursue a coaching career (one that turned out to be long and successful). Many observers will attribute the subsequent lockout of black players to the entry of George Preston Marshall into the league in 1932. Marshall openly refused to have black athletes on his Boston Braves/Washington Redskins team, and reportedly pressured the rest of the league to follow suit. Marshall, however, was likely not the only reason: the Great Depression had stoked an increase in racism and self-inflicted segregation across the country, and internal politics likely had as much of an effect as external pressure. Marshall's hostility was specifically directed at the black race; he openly allowed (and promoted) Native Americans on his team, including his first head coach, Lone Star Dietz, widely believed to be a Native American at the time. The choice of Redskins as his team name in 1933 was in part to maintain the native connotations that came with the previous team's name, the \"Boston Braves\". Another reason for Marshall's anti-black sentiment was to curry favor in the Southern United States; Marshall's Redskins had a strong following in that part of the country, which he vigorously defended, and he stood up against the NFL's efforts to put expansion teams in the South until Clint Murchison Jr.'s extortion attempt as he acquired the rights to the Hail to the Redskins, their fight song, and threatened not to let Marshall use it unless he got an expansion team in Dallas, leading to the establishment of the Dallas Cowboys in 1960. By 1934, there were no more black players in the league. The NFL did not have another black player until after World War II.\nIn 1941, the NFL named its first Commissioner, Elmer Layden. The new office replaced that of President. Layden held the job for five years, before being replaced by Pittsburgh Steelers co-owner Bert Bell in 1946.\nDuring World War II, a player shortage led to a shrinking of the league as several teams folded and others merged. Among the short-lived merged teams were the Steagles (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia) in 1943, the Card-Pitts (Chicago Cardinals and Pittsburgh) in 1944, and a team formed from the merger of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Boston Yanks in 1945.\n1946 was an important year in the history of professional football, as that was the year when the NFL reintegrated. The Los Angeles Rams signed two African American players, Kenny Washington and Woody Strode. Also that year, a competing league, the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), began operation.\nDuring the 1950s, additional teams entered the league. In 1950, the AAFC folded, and three teams from that league were absorbed into the NFL: the Cleveland Browns (who had won the AAFC Championship every year of the league's existence), the San Francisco 49ers, and the Baltimore Colts (not the same as the modern franchise, this version folded after one year). The remaining players were chosen by the now 13 NFL teams in a dispersal draft. Also in 1950, the Los Angeles Rams became the first team to televise its entire schedule, marking the beginning of an important relationship between television and professional football. In 1952, the Dallas Texans went defunct, becoming the last NFL franchise to do so. The following year a new Baltimore Colts franchise formed to take over the assets of the Texans. The players' union, known as the NFL Players Association, formed in 1956.\nThe Greatest Game Ever Played (1958).\nAt the conclusion of the 1958 NFL season, the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants met at Yankee Stadium to determine the league champion. Tied after 60 minutes of play, it became the first NFL game to go into sudden death overtime. The final score was Baltimore Colts 23, New York Giants 17. The game has since become widely known as \"the Greatest Game Ever Played\". It was carried live on the NBC television network, and the national exposure it provided the league has been cited as a watershed moment in professional football history, helping propel the NFL to become one of the most popular sports leagues in the United States. Journalist Tex Maule said of the contest, \"This, for the first time, was a truly epic game which inflamed the imagination of a national audience.\"\nAmerican Football League, merger and Vince Lombardi (1959–1969).\nIn 1959, longtime NFL commissioner Bert Bell died of a heart attack while attending an Eagles/Steelers game at Franklin Field. That same year, Dallas, Texas businessman Lamar Hunt led the formation of the rival American Football League, the fourth such league to bear that name, with war hero and former South Dakota Governor Joe Foss as its Commissioner. Unlike the earlier rival leagues, and bolstered by television exposure, the AFL posed a significant threat to NFL dominance of the professional football world. In 1960, the AFL began play with eight teams and a double round-robin schedule of fourteen games. New NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle took office the same year. The AFL generally avoided placing teams in markets where they directly competed with established NFL franchises. Although four inaugural AFL teams shared markets with NFL teams—the Dallas Texans, Los Angeles Chargers, Titans of New York, and Oakland Raiders (the latter sharing the San Francisco Bay Area with the San Francisco 49ers)—only the franchises in New York (renamed the New York Jets) and Oakland remained in direct competition with NFL teams after the league's early years. The Chargers moved to San Diego after the 1960 season and the Texans moved to Kansas City after the 1962 season, becoming the Chiefs.\nWhen Chuck Bednarik retired from playing linebacker and center for the Philadelphia Eagles in 1962, he became professional football's last full-time two-way player. After his retirement, Bednarik became an outspoken critic of the modern football player's lack of stamina under free substitution.\nThe AFL was able to become a viable alternative to the NFL as it made a concerted effort to attract established talent away from the NFL, signing half of the NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960. The AFL worked hard to secure top college players, many from sources virtually untapped by the established league: small colleges and predominantly black colleges. Two of the eight coaches of the Original Eight AFL franchises, Hank Stram (Texans/Chiefs) and Sid Gillman (Chargers) eventually were inducted to the Hall of Fame. Led by Oakland Raiders owner and AFL commissioner Al Davis, the AFL established a \"war chest\" to entice top talent with higher pay than they got from the NFL. Former Green Bay Packers quarterback Babe Parilli became a star for the Boston Patriots during the early years of the AFL, and University of Alabama passer Joe Namath rejected the NFL to play for the New York Jets. Namath became the face of the league as it reached its height of popularity in the mid-1960s. Davis's methods worked, and in 1966, the junior league forced a partial merger with the NFL. The two leagues agreed to have a common draft and play in a common season-ending championship game, known as the AFL-NFL World Championship. Two years later, the game's name was changed to the Super Bowl.\nAFL teams won the next two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues merged to form a new 26-team league. The resulting newly expanded NFL eventually incorporated some of the innovations that led to the AFL's success, such as including names on player's jerseys, official scoreboard clocks, national television contracts (the addition of \"Monday Night Football\" gave the NFL broadcast rights on all of the Big Three television networks), and sharing of gate and broadcasting revenues between home and visiting teams.\nThe Washington Redskins had no black players until Interior Secretary Stewart Udall threatened to evict them from D. C. Stadium unless they signed a black player. The Redskins first attempted to comply by drafting Ernie Davis, who refused to play under Marshall; the Redskins in turn traded Davis to the Cleveland Browns. The Redskins eventually signed Bobby Mitchell and two other African American players by 1962, thus making them the last major professional football team in America to integrate.\nVince Lombardi led the Green Bay Packers as both head coach and general manager during the 1960s, where his efforts led the team to three straight and five total National Football League championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in Professional Football history. In 1960, even though color barrier still existed in the NFL, as the Redskins at that time still refused to play black players, Jack Vainisi, the Scouting Director for the Packers, and Lombardi were determined \"to ignore the prejudices then prevalent in most NFL front offices in their search for the most talented players.\" Lombardi explained his views by saying that he \"... viewed his players as neither black nor white, but Packer green\". Among professional football head coaches, Lombardi's view on discrimination was not \"de rigueur\" in the midst of the civil rights movement. An interracial relationship between one of the Packer rookies and a young woman was brought to the attention of Lombardi by Packer veterans in his first training camp in Green Bay. The next day at training camp, Lombardi, who had a zero tolerance policy towards racism, responded by warning his team that if any player exhibited prejudice, in any manner, then that player would be thrown off the team. Lombardi, who was vehemently opposed to Jim Crow discrimination, let it be known to all Green Bay establishments that if they did not accommodate his black players equally as well as his white players, then that business would be off-limits to the entire team. Before the start of the 1960 regular season, he instituted a policy that the Packers would only lodge in places that accepted all his players. In the all-white Oneida Golf and Riding Country club in Green Bay, of which Lombardi was a member, Lombardi demanded that he should be allowed to choose a Native American caddie, even if white caddies were available. Lombardi's view on racial matters was a result of his religious faith and the prejudice he had experienced as an Italian-American. While Lombardi was known to treat his players roughly in practices and during games, he insisted on unconditional respect for gay players and front office staff. Demanding \"Nothing But Acceptance\" from players and coaches toward all people, Lombardi would fire a coach or release a player should they insult the sexual orientation of anyone. In Washington, Lombardi's assistant general manager, David Slatterly, was gay, as was PR director Joe Blair, who was described as Lombardi's \"right-hand man.\" According to son Vince Lombardi, Jr., \"He saw everyone as equals, and I think having a gay brother (Hal) was a big factor in his approach ... I think my father would've felt, 'I hope I've created an atmosphere in the locker room where this would not be an issue at all. And if you do have an issue, the problem will be yours because my locker room will tolerate nothing but acceptance.'\" Upon his arrival in Washington, Lombardi was aware of tight end Jerry Smith's sexual orientation. \"Lombardi protected and loved Jerry\", said former teammate Dave Kopay. Lombardi brought Smith into his office and told him that his sexual orientation would never be an issue as long as he was coaching the Redskins; Smith would be judged solely on his on-the-field performance and contribution to the team's success. Under Lombardi's leadership Smith flourished, becoming an integral part of Lombardi's offense, and was voted a First Team All-Pro for the first time in his career, which was also Lombardi's only season as Redskin head coach. Lombardi invited other gay players to training camp, and would privately hope they would prove they could earn a spot on the team. At the Washington Redskins training camp in 1969, Ray McDonald was a gay player, with sub-par skills, who was trying to make the Redskin roster again, but this time with Lombardi as the Redskins' new head coach. True to his word, Lombardi told running back coach, George Dickson, 'I want you to get on McDonald and work on him and work on him – and if I hear \"one\" of you people make reference to his manhood, you'll be out of here before your ass hits the ground.'. The National Football League's Super Bowl trophy is named in Lombardi's honor after he unexpectedly died in 1970 of cancer. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971.\nProfessional football (1970–present).\nPost-merger NFL.\nThe NFL continued to grow, eventually adopting some innovations of the AFL, including the two-point conversion in 1994. It has expanded several times to its current 32-team membership, and the Super Bowl has become a cultural phenomena across the United States. One of the most popular televised events annually in the United States, it has become a major source of advertising revenue for the television networks that have carried it and it serves as a means for advertisers to debut elaborate and expensive commercials for their products. The NFL has grown to become the most popular spectator sports league in the United States.\nOne of the things that have marked the modern NFL as different from other major professional sports leagues is the apparent parity between its 32 teams. While from time to time, dominant teams have arisen, the league has been cited as one of the few where every team has a realistic chance of winning the championship from year to year. The league's complex labor agreement with its players' union, which mandates a hard salary cap and revenue sharing between its clubs, prevents the richest teams from stockpiling the best players and gives even teams in smaller cities such as Green Bay and New Orleans the opportunity to compete for the Super Bowl. One of the chief architects of this labor agreement was former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who presided over the league from 1989 to 2006. In addition to providing parity between the clubs, the current labor contract, established in 1993 and renewed in 1998 and 2006, has kept player salaries low—the lowest among the four major league sports in the United States— and has helped make the NFL the only major American professional sports league since 1993 not to suffer any player strike or work stoppage. In 1994, Paul Tagliabue approved the creation of the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee with the stated goal of studying the effects of concussions and sub-concussive injury in NFL players. Tagliabue appointed rheumatologist Dr. Elliot Pellman to chair the committee. Pellman's appointment was met with harsh criticism, because he is not a neurologist or neuropsychologist and often admitted ignorance about head injuries.\nSince taking over as commissioner before the 2006 season, Roger Goodell has made player conduct a priority of his office. Since taking office, several high-profile players have experienced trouble with the law, from Adam \"Pacman\" Jones to Michael Vick. In these and other cases, Commissioner Goodell has mandated lengthy suspensions for players who fall outside of acceptable conduct limits. Goodell, however, has remained a largely unpopular figure to many of the league's fans, who perceive him attempting to change the NFL's identity and haphazardly damage the sport.\nIn 2010, the NFL finally acknowledged that many of its ex-players were suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In 2013 a book written by ESPN reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru, which was initially broadcast as a documentary film, was made about traumatic brain injury in the National Football League (NFL), particularly concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The documentary, entitled \"League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis\", was produced by \"Frontline\" and broadcast on PBS. The book and film, both devote significant attention to the story of Mike Webster and his football-related brain injuries, and the pathologist who examined Webster's brain, Bennet Omalu. The film also looks closely at the efforts of researchers led by Ann McKee at Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, where the brains of a number of former NFL athletes have been examined. On September 30, 2014, it was announced that 76 of the 79 brains of former NFL players studied by Dr. Ann McKee and her colleagues tested positive for CTE. The study conducted was the largest brain bank study to date and was a twofold increase in the number of confirmed cases of CTE. Playing American football continues to have deadly consequences with 92 players dying between 2005 and 2014, including 8 deaths in 2013, 11 in 2014 and 11 in 2015 as of November 2015.\nOther professional leagues.\nMinor professional leagues such as the original United Football League, Atlantic Coast Football League, Texas Football League, Seaboard Football League and Continental Football League existed in abundance in the 1960s and early 1970s, to varying degrees of success.\nSeveral other professional football leagues have been formed since the AFL–NFL merger, though none have had the success of the AFL. In 1974, the World Football League formed and was able to attract such stars as Larry Csonka away from the NFL with lucrative contracts. However, most of the WFL franchises were insolvent and the league folded in 1975; the Memphis Southmen, the team that had signed Csonka and the most financially stable of the teams, unsuccessfully sued to join the NFL. The American Football Association formed as a continuation of the WFL's legacy in 1978, albeit on a much lower pay scale. That league lasted until 1982.\nIn 1970, Patricia Palinkas became the first woman to ever play on a men's semipro football team when she joined the Orlando Panthers. In 1974, the National Women's Football League was founded, starting play with 7 teams. By the mid-1970s, the average NWFL franchise entry fee was $10,000. The Toledo Troopers had a record from 1971 through 1976 of 39 wins, 1 loss and 1 tie, but folded in 1980 due to financial problems. The NWFL took a year off to restructure in 1987, but by the next year the league had split in two, with the remnants of the NWFL based in Toledo and the new Women's Tackle Football Association based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nIn 1982, the United States Football League formed as a spring league, and enjoyed moderate success during its first two seasons behind such stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker. It intended to move its schedule to the fall in 1986, and tried to compete with the NFL directly, but despite winning an anti-trust suit against the older league the USFL was only awarded token damages, depriving the league of the funds it needed to stay solvent. The USFL ceased operations a month before its first fall season was to begin.\nThe NFL founded a developmental league known as the World League of American Football with teams based in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The WLAF ran for two years, from 1991 to 1992. The league went on a two-year hiatus before reorganizing as NFL Europe in 1995, with teams only in European cities. The name of the league was changed to NFL Europa in 2006. After the 2007 season, the NFL announced that it was closing down the league to focus its international marketing efforts in other ways, such as playing NFL regular season games in cities outside of the U.S.\nShort-lived leagues such as the Regional Football League and Spring Football League formed in the wake of the dot-com boom but evaporated in short order after the boom ended.\nIn 2001, the XFL was formed as a joint venture between the World Wrestling Federation and the NBC television network. It folded after one season in the face of rapidly declining fan interest and a poor reputation. However, XFL stars such as Tommy Maddox and Rod \"He Hate Me\" Smart later saw success in the NFL.\nThe United Football League was a four-team fully professional league which played its first season in October–November 2009. Involved in this league were Mark Cuban, media mogul and owner of the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks and William Hambrecht, a prominent Wall Street investor. The UFL was beset with numerous financial problems, some of which stemmed from the inability to sell television rights, insufficient ticket revenue and insurmountable expenses. Midway through its fourth season, the league abruptly shut down, after which several dozen former players and coaches sued to recover unpaid salaries; all remaining teams had folded and shut down their offices by March, 2013.\nThe Stars Football League played three seasons as a marginally professional league from 2011 to 2013, with its last two seasons restricted entirely to the state of Florida. The Fall Experimental Football League, an explicitly minor league, played two short seasons in 2014 and 2015.\nModern history of youth and high school football (1933–present).\nAmerican has become a popular participatory sport among youth. One of the earliest youth football organizations was founded in Philadelphia, in 1929, as the Junior Football Conference. Organizer Joe Tomlin started the league to provide activities and guidance for teenage boys who were vandalizing the factory he owned. The original four-team league expanded to sixteen teams in 1933 when Pop Warner, who had just been hired as the new coach of the Temple University football team, agreed to give a lecture to the boys in the league. In his honor, the league was renamed the Pop Warner Conference.\nToday, Pop Warner Little Scholars, as the program is now known, enrolls over 300,000 young boys and girls ages 5–16 in over 5000 football and cheerleading squads, and has affiliate programs in Mexico and Japan. Other organizations, such as the Police Athletic League, Upward, and the National Football League's NFL Youth Football Program also manage various youth football leagues.\nAmerican football is a popular sport for high schools in the United States. The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) was founded in 1920 as an umbrella organization for state-level organizations that manage high school sports, including high school football. The NFHS publishes the rules followed by most local high school football associations. More than 13,000 high schools participate in football, and in some places high school teams play in stadiums that rival college-level facilities. In Denton, Texas, for example, a 12,000 seat, $21,000,000 stadium hosts two local high school football teams. The growth of high school football and its impact on small town communities has been documented by landmark non-fiction works such as the 1990 book \"\" and the subsequent fictionalized film and television series.\nIn 1932, when future Ohio State, Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals coach Paul Brown was 24 years old and barely two years out of college, he returned to be the head coach at his alma mater, Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio. His assignment was to turn around a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Dave Stewart, Brown's old coach. During his nine years at Massillon, Brown invented the playbook, a detailed listing of formations and set plays, and tested his players on their knowledge of it. He also originated the practice of sending in plays to his quarterback from the sideline using hand signals. His overall record at the school was 80–8–2, including a 35-game winning streak. Between 1935 and 1940, the team won the state football championship six times and won the High School Football National Championship four times, outscoring opponents by 2,393 points to 168 over that span. After the early losses to archrival Canton McKinley High School, the Tigers beat the Bulldogs six straight times. The Massillon Tigers are historically the second winningest high school football team in the United States having compiled a current record of 849 wins, 277 losses, and 36 ties as of the end of the 2014 season. Along with the Canton McKinley High School Bulldogs, the Tigers represent one half of what many consider to be the greatest high school football rivalry in the nation. It is the only high school contest in America to feature odds in Las Vegas. In 125 meetings (1894–2014), Massillon leads the series 68-52-5. Massillon and their fierce rivalry with Canton are subjects of the 2001 documentary film \"Go Tigers!\". A total of 23 professional players, 3 NFL coaches and 14 collegiate all-Americans have graduated from Massillon High School.\nValdosta High School in Valdosta, Georgia is home to the winningest high school football program in the United States with a record 893 wins, 217 losses, and 34 ties, for a winning percentage of .791% as of November 14, 2014. From 1913 to 2010, the Wildcats have won 6 national championships in football, 24 state championships, and 41 regional championships.\nModern history of American football outside the United States (1933–present).\nAfter American football was played at the 1932 Summer Olympics, the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote:\nIt remained for a spectacle listed on the program as 'American Football' to provide the Tenth Olympiad with its greatest thrill to date. Chances are the game will become an international pastime before the memory of this night game dies away.\nHowever, this prediction was wrong because this sport didn't become popular outside the US. The sport in some ways did accelerate in popularity after World War II, especially in countries with large numbers of U.S. military personnel, who often formed a substantial proportion of the players and spectators. After World War II a four-team tournament between NATO allies on the west coast of Italy was played.\nBy 1998, the International Federation of American Football (IFAF), was formed to coordinate international amateur competition. At present, 45 associations from the Americas, Europe, Asia and Oceania are organized within the IFAF, which claims to represent 23 million amateur athletes. Until 2007, Japan dominated amateur American football outside of the US. The Japanese national team won the first two world cups—hosted by Italy in 1999 and Germany in 2003—defeating Mexico in the play-off on both occasions. Japan had never lost a game until it went down at home, 23–20, to the US Amateur Team in the final of the 2007 World Cup.\nAmerican football was a demonstration sport at the 2005 World Games in Duisburg, Germany. Germany beat Sweden 20 to 6 in the final.\nThe IFAF Women's World Championship was first held in 2010, in Stockholm, Sweden, with six countries competing. The United States beat Canada 66 to 0 in the final.\nA long-term goal of the IFAF is for American football to be accepted by the International Olympic Committee as an Olympic sport. The only time that the sport was played was at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, but as a demonstration sport. Among the various problems the IFAF has to solve in order to be accepted by the IOC are building a competitive women's division, expanding the sport into Africa, and overcoming the current worldwide competitive imbalance that is in favor of American teams.\nMexico.\nAmerican football has been played in Mexico since the early 1920s, and is a strong minority sport at Mexican colleges and universities, mainly in Mexico City. Over successive decades, more universities and colleges joined the championship, and four categories, called \"fuerzas\", were created. The First \"Fuerza\" became the National League in 1970. In 1978, this was reorganized under the name \"Organización Nacional Estudiantil de Fútbol Americano\" (ONEFA). The largest crowd in NFL history was recorded at the American Bowl game at Mexico City on August 15, 1994, when 112,376 people attended the Governor's Cup game between the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Oilers. In 1996 the American Bowl was played in Monterrey at the Estadio Universitario. The first regular season NFL game played outside the United States was held on October 2, 2005 at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City before an NFL regular-season record of 103,467 fans.\nJapan.\nThe Japan American Football Association was founded by educator and Anglican Church in Japan lay missionary Paul Rusch in 1934 with three collegiate teams: Rikkyo, Meiji and Waseda. In 1937, an allstar game involving teams representing eastern and western Japan attracted over 25,000 spectators. Recently, the Rice Bowl has drawn crowds of over 60,000.\nAn NFL exhibition games took place in Tokyo in 1976 called the \"Mainichi Star Bowl\". The American Bowl was held in Japan thirteen times between 1990 and 2005.\nEurope.\nThe game began to take hold in Italy after World War II, with the first game between two European teams occurring between teams from Piacenza and Legnano. A bowl game called the Spaghetti Bowl was played between Fifth Army and Twelfth Air Force in Florence, Italy, on January 1, 1945. The German Football League was formed in 1979. By 1981, the first international games between European nations occurred, as a two-game series between German and Italian teams.\nThe first European governing body, the American European Football Federation (AEFF) was formed in 1982 by representatives from Finland, Italy, Germany, Austria, and France. The league expanded in 1985 to include Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Great Britain and changed its name to the European Football League. Now known as the European Federation of American Football, it now is made up of 14 member nations. Today, there are approximately 800 American football clubs throughout Europe, with the American football Association of Germany (AFVD) overseeing more than 230 clubs.\nThe NFL International Series was inaugurated in 2007 to host NFL regular season games outside the United States. Played at the new Wembley Stadium in London (rebuilt and reopened in 2007), the series increased from one to two games for the 2013 season, and then to three games from the 2014 season, then four games in 2017. Beginning in 2018, the series will move to the Northumberland Development Project, although games may still be played at Wembley Stadium. The success of the International Series has led to speculation that London will be chosen as home of an NFL franchise in the future.\nBrazil.\nAmerican football has been played in Brazil since the 1990s. The official organization governing American football in Brazil is the American Football Association of Brazil, in Portuguese Associação de Futebol Americano de Brasil (AFAB).\nSimilar codes of football.\nA modern sport that derives from American football is Arena football, designed to be played indoors inside of hockey or basketball arenas. The game was invented in 1981 by Jim Foster and the Arena Football League was founded in 1987 as the first major professional league to play the sport. Several other indoor football leagues have since been founded and continue to play today."

        "text": "John \"Rocky\" Ryan (July 5, 1932 – November 3, 2011) was an American professional football player who was a defensive back in the National Football League (NFL) in the late 1950s. Ryan played college football for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He was selected in the second round of the 1954 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears of the NFL.\nEarly years.\nRyan was born in Tolono, Illinois. He attended Unity High School in Tolono, Illinois from 1946 to 1950 and played both football and basketball. In addition, he won the Illinois State Pole Vault Title during the 1947–1948 school year. Ryan's pole vault championship assisted the high school track and field team in finishing tenth overall at the state meet.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from high school, Ryan attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he joined the football team. His style of play lead to him being referred to as a \"daring young Irishman\". Perhaps the highlight of his collegiate football career was playing in the 1952 Rose Bowl, the first nationally televised college football game, where he caught a touchdown pass. Ryan's touchdown was Illinois' final score of the game and was part of a dominant Rose Bowl performance by the team that the University of Illinois Alumni Association would go on to name one of the top ten moments in Illini football history.\nIn addition to his performance on the field, Ryan became known for one significant off-field incident during his collegiate career, referred to as \"The Apple Bowl.\" After the University of Illinois defeated the University of Iowa 33–13 in a game held on November 8, 1952, Iowa fans began to throw apples and other fruit at Illinois players as the players exited the field. Shortly thereafter, Ryan was approached by a University of Iowa fan named Richard Wolfe, and, after an exchange between the two men, Ryan punched Wolfe in the face, breaking his jaw. The incident resulted in the two schools not playing a football game against each other for fifteen years.\nProfessional career.\nIn 1954, he was selected in the second round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. However, his entry into the NFL was delayed as he enlisted in the United States Army and served from 1954 to 1956. Ryan ultimately played for the Eagles during the 1956 and 1957 seasons but, partway through the 1958 season, left the team for the Chicago Bears. It was rumored for a period of time that Ryan was originally placed on waivers by the Eagles for a situation in which his temper \"flared up\" in an exchange with coach Buck Shaw. The 1958 season would be his last with the NFL, at which point he returned to Champaign, Illinois and worked a variety of jobs prior to his retirement."

        "title": "David Irving (American football)",
        "text": "David Ja Rodd Irving (born August 18, 1993) is a former American football defensive tackle. He played college football at Iowa State University, and was a member of the Dallas Cowboys, Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL).\nEarly years.\nIrving grew up in Compton, California, but moved to San Jacinto, California as a youth and attended San Jacinto High School, where he played defensive tackle and tight end as a senior, recording 76 tackles (15 for loss), 7 sacks, 5 forced fumbles, 4 fumble recoveries, 19 receptions for 298 yards and 4 touchdowns.\nCollege career.\nHe accepted a scholarship from Iowa State University. He became a starter after switching from defensive end to defensive tackle as a junior, while posting 8 starts, 19 tackles (4.5 for loss) and 2 sacks. He missed the entire 2014 season after being dismissed from the team following an incident at the VEISHEA festival. He finished his college career with 32 games (8 starts), 44 tackles (7.5 for loss), 3 sacks, one forced fumble, one interception returned for a touchdown, 8 passes defensed and 3 blocked kicks.\nProfessional career.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nIrving was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Kansas City Chiefs after the 2015 NFL draft. He was waived on September 5 and signed to the practice squad.\nDallas Cowboys.\n2015 season.\nOn September 29, 2015, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys from the Chiefs practice squad, to replace a released Davon Coleman. He was used as a backup defensive tackle and had 14 quarterback pressures (sixth on the team) in limited opportunities. \nHe blocked a field goal in the seventh game of the season against the Seattle Seahawks. He suffered a left wrist fracture in the fifteenth game against the Buffalo Bills and was placed on the injured reserve list on December 30.\n2016 season.\nOn October 16, 2016, in a 30–16 win against the Green Bay Packers Irving was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week, when he forced three fumbles, recovering one, had a sack, and batted down a pass. Irving played only 19 snaps in the game.\nHe was ejected from a game against the Cleveland Browns on November 6.\nIn the fourth quarter of the week 15 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Irving had two tackles, one and a half sacks, 2 of his 5 quarterback pressures, a pass defended and a play where he hit quarterback Jameis Winston's arm just as he was releasing a pass that ended up being intercepted. Irving's play also led to Tampa Bay personnel and coverage changes that created opportunities for other Cowboys players, including rookie defensive tackle Maliek Collins sacking Winston with one minute left to play, which set up a game-sealing interception by cornerback Orlando Scandrick.\nIn the 2017 Divisional playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, Irving claims that in the final snap of the game the officials missed a holding call committed by guard T. J. Lang against him. During that play, Aaron Rodgers made a completion to Jared Cook with Cook's maintaining his feet a few inches inbounds from the sidelines. That completion set up a 51-yard Mason Crosby field goal to win the game with only three seconds on the clock.\n2017 season.\nOn March 6, 2017, Irving re-signed with the Cowboys. On May 23, it was announced that Irving would be suspended four games due to violating the league's performance enhancing drugs policy. He dropped his appeal and was officially suspended the first four games of the 2017 season. After joining the team, he was moved from defensive end to the three-technique defensive tackle position. He suffered a concussion in the twelfth game against the Washington Redskins, which was complicated by the fact that he kept playing through it. The lingering symptoms he experienced afterwards forced the team to declare him inactive for the rest of the season.\nDespite missing the first four games because of his suspension, and the final four because of a concussion, Irving still accrued seven sacks (second on the team), 19 quarterback pressures, 12 tackles (3 for loss), 6 passes defensed and one forced fumble. At the time of his concussion in Week 13, Irving was leading all defensive tackles in the NFL in sacks.\n2018 season.\nOn March 14, 2018, the Cowboys placed a second-round restricted free agent tender on Irving. On June 15, it was announced that due to violating the NFL's Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse, Irving would again be suspended for the first four games of the regular season. The Cowboys placed Irving on the reserve/did not report list on July 25 to start training camp, as he dealt with his off-field issues. He was added to the active roster on October 6 after serving his four-game suspension. Irving played in two regular season games, both in October, registering four tackles and one sack. He suffered a high ankle sprain during practice on November 1, and did not play again.\nOn March 1, 2019, Irving was indefinitely suspended by the NFL for again violating the league's policy on substances of abuse. A few days later, he announced that he was quitting football because he was opposed to the NFL's drug policy, specifically with regards to marijuana. He was conditionally reinstated by the NFL on October 16, 2020, and he worked out for the Las Vegas Raiders the next day.\nLas Vegas Raiders.\nOn October 20, 2020, Irving was signed to the Las Vegas Raiders practice squad. He was elevated to the active roster on October 24 and November 14 for the team's weeks 7 and 10 games against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Denver Broncos, and reverted to the practice squad after each game. He was placed on the practice squad/COVID-19 list by the team on November 18, and restored to the practice squad three days later. He was elevated to the active roster again on November 21 for the week 11 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, and reverted to the practice squad again following the game. He was placed back on the practice squad/COVID-19 list on December 22, 2020, and restored to the practice squad again on December 29. His practice squad contract with the team expired after the season on January 11, 2021. On February 18, 2021, Irving re-signed with the Raiders. He was released on May 21, 2021.\nPersonal life.\nFollowing his indefinite suspension from the NFL in March 2019, Irving became an activist for cannabis. He co-founded his own cannabis advocacy magazine called Cannabis Passport with John Scannell who originally invented the Worlds First Rolling paper magazine."

The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest ODI partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the West Indian pairing of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels who put together a second wicket partnership of 372 runs during the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe in February 2015.

        "text": "Matthew John Hodgson (born 2 August 1991) is an Australian professional basketball player. He played college basketball for Southern Utah University and Saint Mary's College of California before debuting in the National Basketball League (NBL) and playing for the Adelaide 36ers, Brisbane Bullets and Perth Wildcats.\nEarly life.\nHodgson was born in the Ipswich suburb of Booval and later attended Ipswich Grammar School where he played basketball for coach Danny Breen. He graduated from Ipswich Grammar in 2008, and earned himself a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in 2009. That same year, he represented the Australian Under-19 national team at the FIBA Under-19 World Championship, helping Australia finish fourth with tournament averages of 4.6 points and 4.1 rebounds in seven games. He also appeared in four SEABL games playing for the AIS in 2009, averaging 3.3 points and 3.8 rebounds per game.\nCollege career.\nSouthern Utah.\nAs a freshman at Southern Utah in 2009–10, Hodgson was one of just two players to start every game during the season, and he set the SUU single-season blocks record with 64 rejections. In addition to leading team in blocks, he also led the squad with a field goal percentage of .584, was second on the team with 4.8 rebounds per game, was second in both offensive (1.3) and defensive (3.5) rebounds per game, and averaged 6.3 points per game, fifth on the team. On 9 January 2010, he scored a career-high 16 points in a loss to South Dakota State.\nAs a sophomore in 2010–11, Hodgson's role on the team dropped dramatically, only starting in 10 out of 29 appearances and managed just 13.1 minutes per game, a big drop from his 23.3 minutes per game as freshman. He still managed to score in double figures five times, and recorded one double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds in a loss to UNLV on 18 December. He finished the season averaging 4.5 points and 3.5 rebounds per game.\nSaint Mary's.\nIn May 2011, Hodgson transferred to Saint Mary's and subsequently sat out of the 2011–12 season due to NCAA transfer regulations. He did, however, compete for Australia at the 2011 Summer Universiade where he averaged 4.7 points, 3.6 rebounds and 16.4 minutes in seven games.\nAs a redshirted junior in 2012–13 playing for the Gaels, Hodgson saw action in 32 games during the season, and averaged 2.8 points and 2.0 rebounds per game. He did manage to rank 11th in the West Coast Conference in blocks with 0.8 per game, and finished the season second on the team with 26 total blocks.\nAs a senior in 2013–14, Hodgson saw action in 34 games and received two starting assignments, finishing the season averaging averaged 3.3 points and 2.6 rebounds per game. He again finished second on the team for total blocks with 31.\nProfessional career.\nFrankston Blues and Melbourne United (2014–2015).\nAfter graduating from Saint Mary's, Hodgson returned to Australia and joined the Frankston Blues for the rest of the SEABL season in June 2014. He appeared in eight games for Frankston, averaging 14.4 points and 7.4 rebounds per game. He later signed with Melbourne United as a development player for the 2014–15 NBL season. However, his rookie campaign was thrown into disarray when he attempted to pass medical and fitness tests prior to the start of pre-season. After failing to pass any of the health or fitness tests with United, they sent him to get it looked at and he was told his meniscus was badly torn. He subsequently underwent surgery to repair his meniscus, and began the season spending six weeks on crutches then another four weeks with his knee in a brace. He started running again in late December and re-joined the playing group for training in mid-January, with the hope of being fit by the end of the regular season and possibly playing a few minutes in the final few games. This ultimately did not happen, and Hodgson failed to appear in a game for United during the 2014–15 season.\nIn May 2015, Hodgson re-joined the Frankston Blues, going on to play five games for the club while averaging 6.8 points and 5.0 rebounds per game.\nAdelaide 36ers (2015–2018).\nOn 7 July 2015, Hodgson signed a two-year deal with the Adelaide 36ers.

Hodgson produced the 36ers' third best debut by an Australian, with his 18 points ranked behind only Brock Motum's 28 in 2014 and Aaron Bruce's 22 in 2008. This earned him Player of the Game honours. On 25 November, he was ruled out for two to four weeks after injuring his knee at training the previous day. He returned to action on 12 December after missing four games, recording nine points and six rebounds in 16 minutes off the bench against the Townsville Crocodiles. Hodgson appeared in 23 games for the fifth-placed 36ers in 2015–16, averaging 3.5 points and 2.4 rebounds in just over eight minutes per game.\nIn March 2016, Hodgson joined the Waverley Falcons for the 2016 Big V season.

In 22 games for the Falcons in 2016, he averaged 17.3 points, 10.3 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game. He subsequently earned Big V All-Star Five honors and was named Co-Defensive Player of the Year.\nAfter failing to record double figures in points or rebounds over the 36ers' first seven games of the 2016–17 NBL season, Hodgson had a season-best game on 12 November 2016, recording 18 points and 14 rebounds in an 85–74 loss to the Illawarra Hawks. The 36ers started the season 3–6, before going on an eight-game winning streak throughout December to head into Christmas on top of the ladder with an 11–6 record.

In 16 games for the Raiders, he averaged 13.9 points and 9.6 rebounds per game.\nOn 28 March 2017, Hodgson re-signed with the 36ers on a two-year deal. Twelve months later, he helped the 36ers reach the 2018 NBL Grand Final series, where they lost 3–2 to Melbourne United. In 35 games for the 36ers in 2017–18, he averaged 4.5 points and 3.2 rebounds per game. On 11 April 2018, Hodgson requested a release from the final year of his contract, and the 36ers granted it.\nBrisbane Bullets (2018–2021).\nOn 27 April 2018, Hodgson signed a one-year contract with the Brisbane Bullets. In September 2018, he suffered a calf injury while playing for the Australian Boomers, which ruled him out for three to four weeks.

In 2020, he played for the South West Metro Pirates of the Queensland State League (QSL).\nOn 7 March 2021, Hodgson scored a career-high 24 points in the Bullets' 96–88 win over Melbourne United. He averaged 10.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks per game during the 2020–21 season.\nIpswich Force, Perth Wildcats and TaiwanBeer HeroBears (2021–2023).\nFor the 2021 NBL1 North season, Hodgson joined the Ipswich Force.\nOn 15 October 2021, Hodgson signed with the Perth Wildcats for the 2021–22 NBL season.\nIn July 2022, Hodgson re-joined the Ipswich Force.\nOn 2 September 2022, Hodgson signed with the TaiwanBeer HeroBears of the T1 League.

        "text": "10 and Under Tennis is a program that was introduced by the United States Tennis Association (USTA) in the summer of 2010. Upon making the change official in 2012, it modified the format of all USTA and International Tennis Federation (ITF) events involving players of years 10 and younger. The program changes the game making it easier for children to succeed. The objective is to adapt the court, balls, racket, and net to the size and strength level of youth players. These alternations create the opportunity for younger players to spend more time hitting balls rather than chasing them. It allows them to hone tennis skills and accelerate their development. The hope is that earlier success in tennis will translate to a lifetime of interest in the sport and perhaps set a foundation for generations of more world-class players.\nUnder the changes made through 10 and Under Tennis, not only are court dimensions smaller, racket shorter, and tennis nets lower but the balls used are larger and have less compression. With a lower compression, balls don't bounce as high. This keeps them within a younger players strike zone creating more chances to make contact with the ball.\nThe unique coloring of the balls provides better visual indication of the spin that both that the player and his/her opponent are able to put on the ball. A large part of developing a strong tennis stroke is being able to generate the necessary ball rotation required in each situation. The colorized ball provides immediate feedback, letting the young players know if they executed their stroke properly.\nAs young players progress in age and ability, the size of the court and balls change as well. The player's progression through the levels of the 10 and Under Tennis program supports an easier transition to the standard adult game. By the time players evolve to the traditional ball and court dimensions, they will have had more chances to master the nuances of the game than players taking more conventional developmental approaches using standard balls, court sizes, and instruction.\nRed Stage 1 (ages 4-6).\nRed stage 1 is for ages four to six.\nBall:\nRacket:\nCourt:\nNet:\nScoring:\nGoals:\nRed Stage 2 (ages 6-8).\nRed stage 2 is for ages six to eight.\nBall:\nRacket:\nCourt:\nNet:\nScoring:\nGoals:\nOrange (ages 7-10).\nOrange stage is for ages seven to ten.\nBall:\nRacket:\nCourt:\nNet:\nScoring:\nGoals:\nGreen (ages 11-12).\nGreen stage is for ages eleven to twelve.\nBall:\nRacket:\nCourt:\nNet:\nScoring:\nGoals:"

        "title": "2016 Daytona 500",
        "text": "The 2016 Daytona 500, the 58th running of the event, was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race held on February 21, 2016, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Contested over 200 laps on the asphalt superspeedway, it was the first race of the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. Denny Hamlin won the race in a photo finish over Martin Truex Jr. The top-five was rounded out by Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and Carl Edwards.\nChase Elliott won the pole for the race and led three laps before crashing out early in the race and finished 37th. Dale Earnhardt Jr., and Kyle Busch won the Duel races. Unlike Busch, Earnhardt Jr. crashed out with 29 laps to go and finished 36th.\nHamlin led a race-high of 95 laps on his way to winning the race. There were six caution flag periods for 31 laps and 20 lead changes among 15 different drivers.\nThis was the 27th career victory for Hamlin, first of the season, first at Daytona International Speedway and fifth win at the track for Joe Gibbs Racing. He left Daytona Beach with a five-point lead over Truex Jr. Toyota left with an eight-point lead over Chevrolet in the manufacturer standings.\nThe Daytona 500 was carried by Fox Sports on the broadcast Fox network for the American television audience. The radio broadcast for the race was carried by the Motor Racing Network and Sirius XM NASCAR Radio.\nThis event featured guest star WWE wrestler John Cena as a pace car driver.\nThis was the first Daytona 500 since 1992 and 1998 not featuring 3-time Daytona 500 winner Jeff Gordon and Tony Stewart on the starting grid. Gordon retired at the end of 2015 and called the 2016 race from the commentators to stand, and Stewart injured his back while riding a dune buggy outside San Diego. Also, this was the last Daytona 500 starts for Bobby Labonte, Robert Richardson Jr., Michael Annett, Brian Vickers, HScott Motorsports, and Carl Edwards.\nReport.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida, that is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Michigan International Speedway, Pocono Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track also features two other layouts that utilize portions of the primary high speed tri-oval, such as a sports car course and a motorcycle course. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built to host racing that was being held by NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.\nThe Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. Since 1995, U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the Indianapolis 500 which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in in-track attendance and international viewing. The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers.\nChanges.\nRestrictor plate.\nFor the events of Speedweeks, the size of the holes in the restrictor plates was reduced from 29/32nd of an inch to 57/64th of an inch.\nRace procedure.\nChanges were made to the green-white-checker procedure for this race and all races in 2016 with an \"overtime line.\" The location of this line will vary from track to track, but it'll be located near the middle of the backstretch at most tracks. If the leader passes the line before a caution comes out, the race will end under caution. If a caution comes out before the leader passes the line, the field will be reset to their original spots and another restart will be attempted until a \"clean restart\" is achieved. These changes are in response to the botched final restart attempt in last October's 2015 CampingWorld.com 500 at Talladega at Talladega Superspeedway.\nEntry list.\nThe entry list for the Daytona 500 was released on Friday, February 12, at 12:05 p.m. Eastern time. Forty-four cars were entered for the race.\nFollowing the 2015 Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, a number of drivers attempted to run for a different team than they did in 2015. Chase Elliott, 2014 NASCAR Xfinity Series champion and son of 1988 Cup Series champion Bill Elliott, took over the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet from the retired Jeff Gordon. Clint Bowyer took over the No. 15 (renumbered from No. 51) from Justin Allgaier. Brian Scott took over the No. 44 (renumbered from No. 9) from Sam Hornish Jr. Chris Buescher, reigning Xfinity Series champion, took over the No. 34 from Brett Moffitt and various of drivers. Landon Cassill took over the No. 38 from David Gilliland. David Ragan took over the No. 23 from Jeb Burton, and J. J. Yeley. Regan Smith took over the No. 7 from Alex Bowman. Brian Vickers drove the No. 14 in place of the injured Tony Stewart.\nPractice.\nFirst practice (February 13).\nDale Earnhardt Jr. was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 46.364 seconds and a speed of .\nSecond practice (February 13).\nJoey Logano was the fastest in the second practice session with a time of 45.934 seconds and a speed of .\nQualifying.\nQualifying for the Daytona 500 is different from any other race weekend because the starting lineup for the race – except for the two drivers that post the two fastest timed laps in the final round of qualifying – isn't set on qualifying day. It sets the lineup for the two duel races the following Thursday.\nUnlike qualifying at non-restrictor plate races, qualifying at Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway consists of two rounds of cars being sent out one at a time to make a single timed lap. The fastest 12 advance to the final round to run for the pole position.\nChase Elliott scored the pole for the race with a time of 45.845 and a speed of . Elliott became the 6th rookie to win the pole for the Daytona 500 joining Loy Allen Jr. (1994), Jimmie Johnson (2002), David Gilliland (2007), Danica Patrick (2013), and Austin Dillon (2014). He said that today was \"a very, very cool day. I don’t know that this opportunity has sunk in yet, much less sitting on the pole for the Daytona 500. I think the big thing is just the team and the Daytona 500 qualifying is about the team guys and the effort they put into these cars and it’s nothing special I did, it’s really what kind of work they did this off-season to make it happen.\"\nAfter qualifying seventh and being all but guaranteed into the Daytona 500 based on speed, Ryan Blaney said that he \"wasn't really too nervous going into today. I knew we had a really fast race car. We just had to do our job and we did it and we just had to lock ourselves in. I really wasn't feeling any different than I do any other day.\"\nLikewise, Matt DiBenedetto – who was also all but guaranteed in on his speed after qualifying 24th – said that he could \"sleep well, finally. I was really nervous all night. This is just a testament to the hard work from the guys on my team. Two-hundredths of a second. I'm really thankful, thankful to be racing in my first Daytona 500, most importantly. I'm really thankful and blessed to be here.\"\nMartin Truex Jr. was unable to post a time over a roof flap issue. The Stewart Haas Racing cars of Kevin Harvick and Brian Vickers had their times disqualified after their track bars failed inspection.\nPractice (post-qualifying).\nThird practice (February 17).\nMichael McDowell was the fastest in the third practice session with a time of 44.961 and a speed of .\nFourth practice (February 17).\nBrian Scott was the fastest in the fourth practice session with a time of 45.045 and a speed of . Kyle Larson and Michael Waltrip will start from the rear of the field in their respective Duel races after being involved in a four-car crash in turn 1.\nFifth practice (February 18).\nJimmie Johnson was the fastest in the fifth practice session with a time of 46.619 and a speed of .\nCan-Am Duel.\nThe Can-Am Duels are a pair of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races held in conjunction with the Daytona 500 annually in February at Daytona International Speedway. They consist of two races 60 laps and in length, which serve as heat races that set the lineup for the Daytona 500. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd-numbered positions on pole qualifying day, while the second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even-numbered positions. The procedure for qualifying changed from the 2015 edition - the Duels now set the lineup for positions 3–38, while positions 39 and 40 are filled by the two \"Open\" (teams without a charter) cars that set the fastest times in qualifying, but did not lock in a spot in the Duels.\nRace 1.\nDale Earnhardt Jr. put on a clinic leading 43 of 60 laps on his way to scoring his fifth Can-Am Duel race victory. He said that it was \"real special. I try not to make too big a deal, but I was thinking about that. I'm guilty of daydreaming a bit about winning this race tonight because of the date. That's very special to me, and I was glad that nothing bad happened, we didn't tear our car up, because that would have been embarrassing on a day like this.\" Michael McDowell raced his way into the Daytona 500 while Cole Whitt failed to make the race. He said that there was indeed \"a lot going on in the off-season. Obviously there was a lot of unknowns with the charter, what was going to happen with that. There was a time where we felt like we were going to be in a tough spot, you know, that we weren't sure if we were going to be able to compete this year at all, whether an open car or charter car. Luckily we were able to put together the partnership with RCR, that alliance. Switching over to Chevy helped strengthen our position there. With Thrivent Financial and KLOVE and all our partners coming onboard, all our sponsors coming onboard, really partnering with Joe Falk at Circle Sport, allowed us to say…”\nRace 2.\nKyle Busch led 35 of 60 laps to score his third career Can-Am Duel win. He joked that his \"plan was just to have everybody stay single-file and we take the checkered flag, but they didn’t see things the way I did.\" The race ended under caution after a multi-car wreck on the final lap in turn 1 that collected Jimmie Johnson, Matt Kenseth and Martin Truex Jr. Jamie McMurray said he \"was trying to block the 48 (Jimmie Johnson). I had stalled out right when I got to the 18 car (Kyle Busch), and I didn’t think the 48 had much of a run either. It felt like our momentum was about the same. I saw the replay and I still don’t know if he was up to my rear bumper or if it was the air that made his car turn. I’m just not sure.” Johnson said that McMurray \"was trying to get underneath the 18 and that didn’t work out, and I creeped up to his outside. He moved up quickly to defend that. I could tell I was going to be taken up into the wall. I tried getting out of there but kind of got into the fence, skipped off the wall and spun out in front of everybody. It was a lot gone wrong, I guess. It’s not like anything was intentional. It’s just a bummer to tear up a car after taking the white flag in a car that we tried so hard to protect and make so fast. There was just a lot gone wrong.” Robert Richardson Jr. transferred into the Daytona 500 while David Gilliland and Reed Sorenson failed to make the race. He said that he was \"very, very honored to be a part of BK Racing, having another opportunity to run here at the Daytona 500. I’ve been in it once before, but this one is very, very special to me. My wife and I welcomed our brand-new baby boy who was born in early December. Every bit of earnings we get from this race is going to go into a college fund for him. It’s just the good Lord looking down on us and blessing us. Got to give all the glory to Him.”\nPractice (post-Duel).\nSixth practice (February 19).\nJimmie Johnson was the fastest in the sixth practice session with a time of 46.372 seconds and a speed of .\nSeventh practice (February 19).\nDenny Hamlin was the fastest in the seventh practice session with a time of 45.077 seconds and a speed of .\nFinal practice (February 20).\nDale Earnhardt Jr. was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 45.655 seconds and a speed of .\nRace.\nFirst half.\nStart.\nUnder clear Florida skies, Chase Elliott led the field to the green flag at 1:33 p.m. He and teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. jumped ahead of Joey Logano to control the field. Earnhardt drove underneath teammate Elliott to take the lead on lap 5. He took to blocking the advance of Logano and Denny Hamlin to hold the lead. Kyle Busch dove underneath Earnhardt going into turn 3 to take the lead on lap 19. The first caution of the race flew the same lap for a two-car wreck on the front stretch. Exiting turn 4, Elliott got loose, came down across the nose of Carl Edwards, slid down into the grass and destroyed the front of his car. He said that he \"got in middle there a couple of laps before and got loose off of (turn) four and just lost it. I hate it. It had been such a fun week and you hate to end the race before it even got started. Just disappointed for everybody. We will just have to look past it and get on for Atlanta. That is the most important thing now. Can't get caught up in what happened today, it is irrelevant now. We'll try and get it fixed and make some laps. Then its on to Atlanta and if we can make some laps we will and move forward from here.\" Regan Smith also got turned in the tri-oval. Hamlin exited pit road with the race lead. Michael Waltrip was tagged for his crew being over the wall too soon and restarted the race from the rear of the field.\nThe race restarted at lap 26. After five laps, Hamlin pulled ahead of Kurt Busch and held the lead unopposed. Jimmie Johnson tried to lead the outside line up towards the front, but it began losing steam and fell back. Eventually, the field jumped to the bottom and ran single-file. The second caution of the race flew on lap 57 for a multi-car wreck on the front stretch. Exiting turn 4, Brian Vickers got loose, overcorrected, spun up the track, spun back down the track and came to a rest at the entrance of pit road. Trying to avoid hitting Vickers, Edwards got turned into the wall by Trevor Bayne who was trying to avoid hitting him as well. Hamlin and Martin Truex Jr. swapped the lead on pit road. Johnson exited pit road with the lead after taking just right-side tires.\nSecond quarter.\nThe race restarted on lap 62. Johnson and Hamlin ran side-by-side for a number of laps. Eventually, the outside line stalled out and Johnson pulled ahead. It started to regain momentum after Johnson jumped to the top. Kyle Busch drove underneath Johnson in turn 2 to take the lead on lap 79. The third caution of the race flew on lap 92 for a multi-car wreck in turn 2. The wreck involved Matt DiBenedetto and Chris Buescher, who slammed the wall. Buescher said it was \"exponentially the hardest hit I’ve ever taken. It’s the first time I’ve ever had to be taken to the infield care center. That’s a bummer, but we’re fine.” DiBenedetto said he had \"no excuse other than I messed up. It happens. We were clean last year, only involved in one accident in 35 races. I hate to start the year that way, but we’re going to be fine.” He would go on to finish 40th. Hamlin exited pit road with the race lead after taking just right-side tires. Michael Annett was tagged for his crew being over the wall too soon and restarted the race from the rear of the field.\nSecond half.\nHalfway.\nThe race restarted on lap 100. The field started to form into three separate lines of racing. But just as quickly as it formed, it disappeared. Debris in turn 3 brought out the fourth caution of the race on lap 119. The debris came from Greg Biffle's car. Hamlin exited pit road with the race lead. Aric Almirola was tagged for an uncontrolled tire and restarted the race from the rear of the field.\nThe race restarted on lap 124. After making headway towards the front, the outside line fizzled out. It reformed and began moving back up towards the front. Denny Hamlin and the first five cars hit pit road to kick off a cycle of green flag stops. This handed the lead to Austin Dillon. He pitted the next lap and handed the lead to Brad Keselowski. He pitted the next lap and handed the lead to Annett. He pitted the next lap and the lead cycled to Kenseth. Johnson and Patrick were tagged for their crews being over the wall too soon and Waltrip was tagged for an uncontrolled tire. All three were forced to serve a pass-through penalty. Waltrip was black-flagged for not serving the penalty within three laps.\nFourth quarter.\nThe fifth caution of the race flew with 29 laps to go for a single-car wreck in turn 4. Exiting the turn, Earnhardt got loose, turned down the track and slammed the inside wall. He said that he got caught \"by surprise there. I was trying to sidedraft the guy beside me. We’ve been working on the balance all day. That was our problem. We underestimated how important handling was going to be today. We had a rocket all week. But in two-car runs and in night races the car handled great. We’ve got to do a little more drafting next time when we come back we’ll be ready for the balance. We were starting to move forward, getting aggressive. Just lost it.”\nThe race restarted with 25 laps to go. The sixth caution of the race flew with 18 laps to go for a two-car spin on the backstretch. Heading towards turn 3, Greg Biffle got into the left-rear corner panel of Patrick and sent her spinning through the grass. Her car hopped once through the air and the splitter dug into the ground. Biffle then overcorrected and side-slammed the wall. Patrick said that she was in a position that she \"shouldn’t have been in. There is some confusion about whether there actually was a man over the wall too early. We shouldn’t have been racing for the lucky dog.”\nThe race restarted with 12 laps to go. Kenseth remained comfortably in the lead as the outside line continued to lose momentum. Kenseth had asked over the team radio that, since Toyota drivers occupied the top 5 places, they should work as a team until the final lap, at which point they would start racing each other so as to get a team victory and avoid wrecks. When the white flag waved for the final lap, Kevin Harvick in his Chevy drafted up the outside, overtaking the Toyota of Carl Edwards. Denny Hamlin saw the advancing Harvick and jumped to the outside line from 4th to block his advance, was bumped by Harvick on the back straight and drafted all the way to the front past Kyle Busch and Martin Truex and drew alongside his teammate Kenseth. Kenseth came down on Hamlin, got himself loose and fell back to finish 14th. Hamlin and Truex drag raced to the finish line and Hamlin prevailed by 0.010 seconds, the closest in Daytona 500 history.\nPost-race.\nHamlin said in victory lane that this win \"is the best. I mean, it’s just the best. It’s the biggest race of my life. The Daytona 500 is – as a kid what you – this is the pinnacle of our sport and I’m just proud to be here. The last thing I wanted to do was wreck off turn four with my Toyota teammates and none of us win. We had talked about a plan overnight to just work together, work together and I’ve never seen it executed so flawlessly as what we did today.”\nAfter coming up just short, Truex said he \"did all I thought I could do. I had the lead. I probably should have run him up a little more, just lost in the last second. … Really proud of everybody. Really proud of the teamwork with the JGR guys. We're team players, and we're in it for the long haul with them. Congrats to Denny. He beat me by a couple of feet.”\nAfter an injury kept Kyle Busch out of the previous year's Daytona 500, he said of his third-place finish that it was \"definitely a lot better to be in the race where I’m supposed to be than standing on the sidelines watching across the street. It played out real well. We ran up front most of the day. We were probably the top (Joe Gibbs Racing) running car most of the day, but you have to lead the last laps and I didn’t get a chance to.”\nAfter finishing sixth in his quest to repeat as Daytona 500 champion, Logano said that Harvick \"got in front of me and we started moving and then the 11 (Hamlin) saw that and jumped up there and got the push from both of us and then it was a heck of a finish. I don’t like being behind watching it. I want to be involved with it. Overall it is a great start for our Shell Pennzoil team and we kicked off the season with a bunch of great finishes down here in Daytona and we are looking forward to getting to Atlanta.\"\nAfter going from the lead to 14th on the final lap, Kenseth said that he \"wouldn't trade that position for anybody in the whole field. I didn't really think the outside was going to muster up enough run to get it to be honest with you. Somehow, (Hamlin) just got a massive run. Hindsight I probably should have stayed in front of Martin and tried to race him back to the line. It looked like he was going so fast I could get in front of him and get a little boost and I just couldn't.\"\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince 2001 – with the exception of 2002, 2004 and 2006 – the Daytona 500 has been carried by Fox in the United States. The booth crew consisted of longtime NASCAR lap-by-lap announcer Mike Joy, three-time Daytona 500 champion Jeff Gordon, and 1989 race winner Darrell Waltrip. Pit road was manned by Jamie Little, Chris Neville, Vince Welch and Matt Yocum.\nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the Motor Racing Network – which has covered the Daytona 500 since 1970 – and simulcast on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. The booth crew consisted of longtime announcer Joe Moore, Jeff Striegle and 1989 Sprint Cup Series champion Rusty Wallace. Longtime turn announcer – and prodigy of MRN co-founder Ken Squier – Dave Moody was the lead turn announcer. He called the Daytona 500 from atop the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 2 when the field was racing through turns 1 and 2. Mike Bagley worked the backstretch for the Daytona 500 from a spotter's stand on the inside of the track. Kyle Rickey called the Daytona 500 when the field was racing through turns 3 and 4 from the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 4. On pit road, MRN was manned by lead pit reporter and NASCAR Hall of Fame Executive Director Winston Kelley. He was joined on pit road by Steve Post and Alex Hayden."

        "title": "2016 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2016 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2015–16 season and conclusion of the 2016 playoffs. The Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the defending NBA champion and Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors four games to three in a rematch of the previous year's Finals. It was the 14th rematch of the previous NBA Finals in history, and the second straight rematch in back-to-back years, as the Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs played each other in 2013 and 2014. The series was played from June 2 to 19.\nThe win gave the Cavaliers their first NBA championship, ending the Cleveland sports curse. They became the first team in NBA history to overcome a 3–1 deficit in the Finals and the fourth team to win the series after losing the first two games. This also marked the first time since 1978 that Game 7 was won by the road team and as of 2023, this is the most recent NBA Finals to feature a Game 7. Because of Cleveland's comeback, these Finals are widely regarded as among the greatest in NBA history.\nLeBron James was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP), receiving all 11 Finals MVP votes, and was also the first player in NBA history to lead all players in a playoff series in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. His stellar performance in the series, which included a clutch block in Game 7 on Andre Iguodala, helped it become known as one of the greatest NBA Finals of all time.\nBackground.\nCleveland Cavaliers.\nThis was Cleveland's second consecutive trip to the NBA Finals, and third overall, seeking to win their first ever NBA championship. This would also be the sixth consecutive NBA Finals appearance for LeBron James, the most for any player not part of the 1960s Boston Celtics, and the fifth for James Jones (who technically qualified for the 2011 NBA Finals along with James, but did not play).\nDespite holding the best record in the Eastern Conference at 30–11 midway through the season on January 22, 2016, the Cavaliers fired head coach David Blatt. Associate head coach Tyronn Lue was then promoted to replace Blatt. General Manager David Griffin cited \"a lack of fit with our personnel and our vision\" as the reason for Blatt's firing.\nCleveland finished the regular season with a 57–25 record, capturing the Central Division title and the top playoff seed in the Eastern Conference. They then advanced to the Finals after sweeping both the Detroit Pistons in the first round and the Atlanta Hawks in the second round, and defeating the Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games. The Cavaliers were the first team in history to go to two consecutive\nNBA Finals with rookie head coaches.\nGolden State Warriors.\nThis was the defending NBA Champion Golden State Warriors' second consecutive trip to the NBA Finals and eighth overall. The Warriors broke the record set by the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls by finishing the regular season with a 73–9 record. In addition, the Warriors broke numerous other NBA records, including most road wins (34), best start to a season (24–0) and longest regular-season home win streak (54 dating back to the 2014–15 season). They also became the first team to make over 1,000 three-pointers in the regular-season with 1,077, eclipsing the previous record of 933 set by the 2014–15 Houston Rockets.\nThe Warriors were led by Stephen Curry, who was named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. The Splash Brothers twosome of Curry and Klay Thompson were the highest scoring duo in the league, combining to average 52.2 points per game. Head coach Steve Kerr missed the first 43 regular season games because of a back injury. Assistant coach Luke Walton served as interim head coach during Kerr's absence and he led the Warriors to a 39–4 start.\nIn the playoffs, the Warriors defeated the Houston Rockets in the first round and the Portland Trail Blazers in the conference semifinals in five games each. Curry missed six games in the first two rounds due to injuries. He missed two games after tweaking his right ankle in Game 1 against the Rockets. In his first game back in Game 4, he sprained his right knee and was sidelined for two weeks, missing four games. In Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals, the Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 96–88, becoming only the 10th team in NBA history to overcome a 3–1 series deficit, and advancing to a second straight NBA Finals for the first time since 1947 and 1948.\nRegular season series.\nThe Warriors won the regular season series 2–0.\nSeries summary.\nFor the first time since 2004, a new scheduling format was instituted for the Finals. In the previous years, the Finals were played in a Thursday–Sunday–Tuesday scheme. However, the league changed its scheduling to ensure an extra day off for both teams when traveling between the two cities. This, along with the designated travel day, took place after Games 2, 4, 5, and 6 in subsequent finals. This scheduling change was necessary as a result of the National Hockey League instituting a new scheduling format for its championship series that went into effect beginning in 2016.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 104–89 in Game 1 to take a 1–0 series lead. The Cavaliers led 68–67 before the Warriors broke the game open with a 29–9 run spanning the third and fourth quarters to take a 96–76 lead. Cleveland cut the deficit to within eleven points at 98–87 after an 11–2 run, but Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson nailed back-to-back three-pointers to essentially seal the victory for Golden State. While Curry and Thompson had a rough night combining for 20 points, the Warriors got a lift from its bench, outscoring the Cavaliers' bench 45–10. Shaun Livingston scored his playoff-career high 20 points to lead Golden State, while Kyrie Irving led all scorers with 26 points. LeBron James fell one assist shy of a triple-double (23 points, 12 rebounds, 9 assists).\nGame 2.\nThe Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 110–77 in Game 2 to take a 2–0 series lead. Cleveland took a 28–22 lead about two minutes into the second quarter, but Golden State answered with a 20–2 run while outscoring the Cavs 30–16 the rest of the period. During the run, the Cavaliers' Kevin Love suffered a head injury while attempting to grab a defensive rebound. Love stayed throughout the remainder of the period but did not play the second half. The Warriors continued to dominate Cleveland from there, outscoring the Cavaliers 58–33 in the final two quarters. Draymond Green led all scorers with 28 points, including 5 of 8 from three-point range. Curry and Klay Thompson added 18 and 17 points, respectively, while drilling four threes each.\nWith their victory, the Warriors posted the highest winning margin in the first two Finals games with a 48-point differential. James led the Cavs with 19 points, 8 rebounds, 9 assists and 4 steals, surpassing John Stockton for fourth on the all-time playoff steals list. However, he also committed 7 turnovers in the loss.\nGame 3.\nThe Cavaliers avenged their lopsided defeat to Golden State by routing the Warriors 120–90 in Game 3 to cut the series deficit to 2–1. The Cavaliers scored the game's first nine points en route to outscoring the Warriors 33–16 after one quarter. Golden State rallied to trim Cleveland's lead as low as seven points on a couple of occasions before the Cavs settled for a 51–43 halftime lead. In the second half, Cleveland continued to extend their lead and outscored Golden State 69–47. Love did not play due to a concussion. James led all scorers with 32 points. Irving added 30 points for the Cavs. Curry led the Warriors with 19 points, while drilling four threes. Harrison Barnes also contributed 18 points in 33 minutes of play.\nGame 4.\nThe Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 108–97 in Game 4 to take a 3–1 series lead. After averaging just 16 points in the first three games of the series, Curry scored 38 and was 7 of 13 on three-pointers. The Warriors made 17 three-pointers, then an NBA record for a single Finals game. They made only 16 two-point field goals, the first time in Finals history a team made more shots from three-point range. Klay Thompson added 25 points and four three-pointers for Golden State. It was the Warriors' 88th win of the season, which broke the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls record of 87 for most wins in an NBA season (regular-season and postseason combined). \nGreen and James had to be separated in the closing minutes of the game, when Green fell to the ground and James stepped over him. \nFeeling disrespected, Green swung his arm and appeared to make contact with James' groin.\nGame 5.\nThe Cavaliers defeated the Warriors 112–97 in Game 5 to narrow the Warriors' series lead to 3–2. James and Irving each scored 41 points to become the first teammates in Finals history to score 40 or more in the same game. James also added 16 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 steals and 3 blocks, while Irving had 6 assists of his own. After Game 4, Green was assessed a Flagrant Foul 1 for his contact with James that was ruled \"unnecessary\" and \"retaliatory\", and James was given a technical foul for taunting. Having accumulated his fourth flagrant foul point in the playoffs, Green was suspended for Game 5, becoming the first player to be suspended from playing in a Finals game since Jerry Stackhouse in 2006. Green watched the game from a luxury box in the nearby Oakland Alameda Coliseum, where the Oakland Athletics were also playing a game at the same time, hosting the Texas Rangers.\nWarriors center Andrew Bogut suffered a season-ending injury to his left knee in the second half when he jumped to block a layup attempt by Cavs guard J. R. Smith and came down awkwardly on Smith.\nGame 6.\nThe Cavaliers defeated the Warriors 115–101 in Game 6 to even the series 3–3. The Cavaliers scored the game's first eight points en route to outscoring the Warriors 31–11 after one quarter. Golden State rallied to trim Cleveland's lead as low as eight points on a couple of occasions before the Cavs settled for a 59–43 halftime lead, with Tristan Thompson having his best performance of the series, registering a double-double in the first half alone. In the second half, Cleveland continued to extend their lead and tied the series. LeBron James led the Cavs with a historic performance of 41 points, 11 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks while only committing 1 turnover. Kyrie Irving added 23 points, while Tristan Thompson had 16 rebounds for the Cavaliers. Stephen Curry led the Warriors with 30 points, drilling six threes, and Klay Thompson added 25 points. Back from suspension, Green was held to just eight points on 3–7 shooting.\nJames scored 18 straight points for Cleveland from the end of the third quarter to the 7:00 mark of the fourth. Late in the game with the Cavaliers up by 13, he blocked a Curry shot from behind, and afterward had some words for him. With 4:22 left, Curry received his sixth foul and fouled out of the game. He then threw his mouthpiece into the stands in frustration, resulting in a technical foul and his ejection from the game. Curry was the first MVP to foul out of an NBA Finals game since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000. The Cavaliers became the third team to fall behind 3–1 and force Game 7 (and the first in 50 years). James was the first player to have consecutive 40-point games in the Finals since, coincidentally, Shaquille O'Neal in the 2000 Finals. Following the game, Curry and Warriors head coach Steve Kerr were fined $25,000 each for their actions and public officiating criticism.\nGame 7.\nThis season's Finals marked the first time in NBA history in which both teams entered Game 7 with the same total points scored through six games (610 points each). The Cavaliers defeated the Warriors 93–89 in Game 7 to win the series 4–3. Game 7 was close, with 20 lead changes and 11 ties. This was the only game in the series to have a final margin of fewer than 10 points. At halftime, the Warriors were ahead 49–42. In the second half, the Cavaliers outscored the Warriors 51–40 as the Warriors failed to score a basket during the last 4:39 of the game. In the closing minutes of the 4th quarter, LeBron James delivered what became known as \"The Block\" on a layup attempt by Andre Iguodala with the score tied at 89 and 1:50 remaining in the game. Kyrie Irving made a go-ahead 3-point field goal over Stephen Curry to give Cleveland a 92–89 lead with 0:53 remaining in the game. Before Kyrie Irving's 3-point field goal, both teams were tied at 699 points scored apiece in this series. Immediately after Irving's 3-pointer, Golden State brought the ball up-court, opting not to call a timeout, and although Golden State got a preferred switch and matchup of Curry on Kevin Love, Love made arguably \"the biggest defensive stop of the entire NBA season\", and forced Curry into a contested 3-pointer, which he missed. After LeBron James hurt his right wrist on a dunk attempt in which he was fouled by Draymond Green, he virtually clinched the title for the Cavaliers by making one of two free throws, putting them 4 points ahead with only 10.6 seconds left in the game. The Cavaliers fouled Draymond Green with 6.5 seconds remaining. Stephen Curry received the ensuing inbounds pass, pump faked and shot a three-pointer over Cavaliers guard Iman Shumpert. The attempt missed, and was rebounded by Marreese Speights of the Warriors who then missed a three-point attempt as time expired. Draymond Green put up his best performance of the Finals, leading all scorers with 32 points, including 6 of 8 from three-point range to go along with 15 rebounds and 9 assists. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson added 17 and 14 points, respectively. LeBron James led all Cavaliers with 27 points and became only the third player ever in NBA history to record a triple double in an NBA Finals Game 7 by adding 11 assists and 11 rebounds. Kyrie Irving added 26 points for Cleveland.\nThe Cavaliers became the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit to win the NBA Finals. They became the first NBA Champion to clinch all their playoff series on the road since the 1999 San Antonio Spurs, as well as the first road team to win a Finals Game 7 since the 1978 Washington Bullets. The Cavaliers won their first championship in franchise history, ending a 52-year pro sports championship drought for the city of Cleveland (whose previous victory was when the 1964 Cleveland Browns defeated the Baltimore Colts in the NFL Championship game), as well as 26-year drought for the State of Ohio (whose previous championship was when the 1990 Cincinnati Reds defeated the Oakland Athletics in the World Series). LeBron James was named the unanimous Finals MVP, becoming only the fifth player in NBA history to earn the award three times or more. He also was the overall leader in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks during the series, a feat that had never been accomplished in an NBA playoff series. Tyronn Lue became the 14th coach to win an NBA championship as a head coach and player.\nThis also marked the first time an NBA Finals went to a Game 7 under the 2-2-1-1-1 format since it was reinstated in 2014.\nOn July 13, Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals received the 2016 ESPY award for Best Game.\nBroadcast.\nIn the United States, the NBA Finals aired on ABC with Mike Breen as play-by-play commentator, and Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy serving as color commentators. TNT's Craig Sager made an appearance for Game 6 as a sideline reporter, his first appearance at the NBA Finals, and his last game before he died later that year in December. ESPN Radio aired it as well and had Kevin Calabro and Hubie Brown as commentators. ESPN Deportes provided exclusive Spanish-language coverage of The Finals, with a commentary team of Álvaro Martín and Carlos Morales.\nAftermath.\nThe Cavaliers and Warriors also met in the following two NBA Finals, the first time in any of North America's four major professional sports leagues that the same two teams met for the championship four years in a row. The Warriors, who added Kevin Durant in the 2016 offseason, defeated the Cavaliers in five games in and a four-game sweep in . Durant was named the Finals' MVP in both series.\nThe Warriors made it to a fifth consecutive Finals in , which they would lose to the Toronto Raptors in six games. Three years later, they made it to their sixth Finals in eight seasons and defeated the Boston Celtics in six games.\nJames left the Cavaliers in the 2018 offseason to join the Los Angeles Lakers. He would lead the Lakers to a title in and win Finals MVP that year.\nFollowing James departure the Cavaliers would not make the playoffs again until 2023 which was also their first playoff appearance without him since 1998."

        "text": "The 1970–71 Serie A basketball championship was the 48th season of the Serie A, the highest professional basketball league in Italy.\nThe regular season ran from 18 October 1970 to 28 March 1971, twelve teams played 22 games each. As both Ignis Varese and Simmenthal Milano were tied first with the same head-to-head record (having only lost once apiece, to each other) a single playoff game decided the title, the third ever played between the two squads (one on-the-court win per side, respectively in 1962 and 1966). Varese won the game played in Rome to earn their third straight championship, fifth overall (and the single spot in the European Champions Cup).\nThe other end of the league table also saw a tie, with three teams on the same points for two relegation spots, hence playoffs were also played where Libertas Livorno and Cecchi Biella (both newly promoted) were relegated back to the Serie B.\nPreseason.\nIgnis Varese, who had the previous season completed the domestic double (league and Italian Cup) in addition to winning the European Champions Cup (adding the Intercontinental Cup before the season) were seen as the overwhelming favourites.\nSimmenthal Milano, All'Onestà Milano and on a lesser note Forst Cantù and Splügen Venezia were seen as the likely challengers. \nAll but one club had sponsorship names – widely the major source of revenue for clubs – with Libertas Livorno the involuntary exception.\nWith only one foreign player allowed per club, nearly all were American, Varese's Mexican international Manuel Raga (considered the best foreigner in the league) and Splügen Venezia's newly arrived Brazilia international Ubiratan were the notable exceptions.\nIgnis, led by Aca Nikolić, could still count on Raga, Dino Meneghin, Aldo Ossola, Ottorino Flaborea and Paolo Vittori, adding Italian international Ivan Bisson from Snaidero Udine whilst sending Claudio Malagoli and Livio Paschini the other way (American John Fultz was signed only for the European Champions Cup). \nSimmenthal, coached by Cesare Rubini, had replaced on-off American Jim Tillman with compatriot Arthur Kenney, the retirement of historic player Sandro Riminucci was the only other change. All'Onesta put their trust in the proven quartet of Joe Isaac, Tony Gennari, Enrico Bovone and Marino Zanatta, Forst Cantù had supplemented key players Carlo Recalcati and Alberto De Simone with American newcomer Bob Lienhard whilst an important move saw Dado Lombardi move from Norda Bologna to cross-town rivals Eldorado Bologna for 25 million lira.\nRegular season.\nBoth Ignis and Simmenthal raced ahead of the others, so much that by the time they met each other in Varese on 27 December 1970 they were both unbeaten, with only Fides Napoli having provided any serious opposition.\nThe game was already seen as title-deciding, Ignis had the best defence (60,1 points conceded per game to Simmenthal's 63.8) but the Milanese were more prolific in attack (81.8 points per game to Varese's 79.4) and were seen to have a slight edge over the holders. \nUltimately, Varese would win a hard-fought if not spectacular game 71-58, Meneghin out-rebounded Massimo Masini to score 16 points while Vittori and Flaborea dominated in attack (the first scoring a game-high 22 points).\nThough Giorgio Giomo shackled Raga well and Kenney put in a fighting performance (15 points), it was not enough for Simmenthal, not helped by an anonymous performance from Renzo Bariviera (3 points).\nWhen came the time to play the return game in Milan on the 14 March 1971 the situation remained unchanged with both teams having won all their games in between (including in Europe).\nThe game, reportedly played at the highest level, saw a partial repeat of the first leg as an in-form Vittori again top-scored (25 points) whilst Flaborea (18 points) also stepped up when Giomo's good marking on Raga restricted the sharpshooter.\nHowever, this time Simmenthal stepped up to the challenge and an extremely combative Kenney dished up 20 points, including two free-throws with only seconds left, whilst Masini added as much, to grab a close 72-71 win.\nWith both squads on the same points and with the same head-to-head record, a playoff game was seen as virtually guaranteed despite there being three rounds left to play as no team could challenge the leaders. \nIt proved to be the case as both squads easily won their final games to preserve the status-quo and make a playoff necessary.\nSimmenthal even recorded the most points scored in a league game by downing Snaidero Udine 138-88 in the final round on 24 April, four days before other games as Milano were playing the Cup Winners' Cup final.. The 138 points record, replacing the 133 Simmenthal themselves had scored the previous season, stayed as league record for decades, it still is a club record as of 2015.\nForst Cantù comfortably beat presumed title-challenger All'Onesta Milano 90-57 in Milan in the second round. They proved to be the surprise squad of the tournament as the emergence of an eighteen-year-old Pierluigi Marzorati at playmaker coupled with good performances from Lienhard and Recalcati led them to third-place, 10 points from the leading duo but themselves 8 points in front of the rest of the pack led by All'Onesta Milano, an Ubiratan-led Splügen Venezia and a workmanlike Fides Napoli.\nIn the relegation battle, the two promoted squads Cecchi Biella and Libertas Livorno predictably struggled but managed to win the odd game (Biella was greatly helped by American import Rudy Bennett, third-best league scorer with 22.8 points per game).\nAt the same time Norda Bologna spent a large part of the season in free-fall, losing twelve consecutive games until a win over Snaidero Udine during the penultimate round enabled them to join Biella and Livorno on 10 points (from five wins).\nAll three lost their final game, which both Livorno and Biella had to play at a neutral venue (respectively Florence and Borgosesia) due to being penalised for previous crowd behaviour), meaning a three-way playoff series was needed to decide relegation.\nStandings.\nSource: Lega Basket\nIndividual scoring table.\n\"Source: unofficial statistics compiled by the Giganti del Basket magazine (official statistics started from the 1975–76 season).\"\nPostseason.\nTitle playoff.\nThe title-deciding playoff was played as a single game on 3 April 1971 at a neutral venue, namely Rome's Palazzo dello Sport. \nIt proved slightly anticlimactic as Ignis raced in front during the first minutes and never allowed Simmenthal back in the game on the way to securing a 65-57 win and their third straight league championship.\nManuel Raga was the foremost contributor to Varese's lead, escaping first Giomo's then Giuseppe Brumatti's then Kenney's marking to score 17 points in 12 minutes whilst at the same time the normally accurate Giulio Iellini and Giomo were shooting astray for Milano.\nWith Flaborea and Vittori also potent in attack and Meneghin in defence, Milano's task became even greater despite Masini's efforts as the half-time score read 39-21 for the champions.\nThough Simmenthal managed to reduce the deficit in the second half, the gulf was too big and Varese were comfortable enough to rest Raga and play eighth man Paolo Polzot (who had arrived from Biella that season and rarely came off the bench) for nearly all the half.\nRelegation playoffs.\nThe relegation playoffs were played on the 2nd, 3rd and 4 April 1971 in Cantù (originally scheduled in Milan's Palalido, they were moved after student protesters occupied the arena).\nEach team won and lost a game apiece, Norda Bologna ultimately escaped relegation thanks to a superior points differential (+14 to Livorno's -4 and Biella's -10).\nItalian Cup.\nIgnis Varese won nearly all the competitions they played after lifting the Italian Cup, beating Fides Napoli 83-60 in the final, played in Viareggio on 12 April 1971. The third place game between losing semifinalists saw Simmenthal Milano down Forst Cantù 66-63.\nChampionship-winning squad.\nIgnis Varese 1969–70 Serie A champions\nSource: Lega Basket"

        "text": "Rizin Fighting Federation (stylised in all caps and also known as Rizin FF) is a Japanese mixed martial arts organization created in 2015 by the former Pride Fighting Championships and Dream Stage Entertainment president Nobuyuki Sakakibara. In February 2024, Rizin announced the launch of a new international service, RIZIN.tv. From March, the service will be subscription-based, and will include past events.\nFounded to be the spiritual successor of Pride FC and Dream, Rizin carries much of the philosophy and ambition of its two predecessors: its events are promoted as larger-than-life events with elaborate opening ceremonies and fighter entrances, its matches are fought in a roped ring and it has a ruleset inherited from Pride and Dream. The organization also promotes \"Grand Prix\", single-elimination tournaments where fighters have to fight multiple opponents in the same night. Rizin is considered Japan's top MMA promotion.\nRizin has also promoted kickboxing matches, with two \"Grand Prix\" tournaments in 2017 and 2021.\nThe promotion's name is a combination of \"Raijin\", the Japanese god of lightning; the word \"rising\", meaning \"to prosper and thrive\"; and the letter, 'Z', meaning \"ultimate\".\nHistory.\nBackground and formation.\nIn 1997, Pride Fighting Championships was founded in Japan, promoted by Dream Stage Entertainment. The organization quickly rose up to become the world's most popular MMA promotion and helped to popularize the sport in Japan and in the world. Pride differentiated itself from the UFC with its focus on spectacle and entertainment, as well a more permissive ruleset. By 2007, a scandal alleging its ties to the yakuza caused a financial decline that lead to the promotion folding. Dream Stage Entertainment was bought by Zuffa—UFC's holding company—which initially promised to keep the event running. However, Zuffa would lay off most of Pride's staff with several Pride fighters moving to the UFC. \nAfter Pride folded, most of DSE's former staff, fighters and executives joined Fighting and Entertainment Group, the promoters of K-1, to organize a successor, which became known as Dream. However, FEG would have its own financial issues and went bankrupt in 2012. As a result, Dream became defunct.\nThree years after Dream folded, rumors began circulating that Pride and Dream founder Nobuyuki Sakakibara would return to the industry after an interview with Bellator MMA President Scott Coker was released. On September 19, 2015, during , it was announced that Sakakibara had signed former Pride Heavyweight Champion Fedor Emelianenko to headline a New Year's Eve Show in Tokyo for his new MMA promotion. Sakakibara held a press conference on October 8, 2015, with Nobuhiko Takada and other former Pride FC employees to formally announce the launch of \"Rizin Fighting Federation\". Initial signees included Kazushi Sakuraba, Shinya Aoki, as well as female competitors Gabi Garcia and Rena Kubota.\nA Grand Prix tournament was announced (held at 100 kg or roughly 220 lbs), with champions and competitors from Bellator, KSW, Jungle Fight, BAMMA, and King of Kings. Most notably, King Mo was announced to represent Bellator in the tournament. The 8-man bracket was officially finalized on November 30, 2015, with other bouts also being announced shortly thereafter. Kron Gracie (whose father Rickson competed at the inaugural PRIDE event) was announced to participate against Asen Yamamoto. Amongst the veterans in the Japanese scene, Tsuyoshi Kosaka would face James Thompson, and Akebono Tarō would face Bob Sapp.\nInitial plans were to do at least four events per year, as opposed to the more frequent scheduling of other promotions, in order to build up the excitement and anticipation. Rizin's presentation is modeled after major sporting events, such as the UEFA Champions League and FIFA World Cup.\n2016–present.\nIn 2018, it was announced that the main event for the traditional New Year's Eve card (Rizin 14) was going to be a boxing match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and undefeated Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa. The match ended up with Nasukawa knocked out two minutes into the first round.\nRizin Trigger 1st, on November 11, 2021, would be Rizin's first event in which matches would take place inside a cage, instead of the traditional roped ring.\nOn December 31, 2022, as the traditional New Year's Eve event, Rizin hosted a crossover Bellator vs Rizin card with Bellator MMA as part of Rizin 40. The card saw fighters from each promotion fight each other. The card saw Bellator MMA fighters Gadzhi Rabadanov, former champions A.J. McKee, Juan Archuleta and Kyoji Horiguchi, and current champion Patricio Freire, fighting against Rizin representatives Koji Takeda, Soo Chul Kim, Hiromasa Ougikubo and champions Kleber Koike Erbst and Roberto de Souza. All five Bellator representatives would win their matches in a clean sweep. During the event, former boxing world champion Manny Pacquiao made a public announcement that he had signed with Rizin for a boxing exhibition match against an yet-unannounced opponent.\nDuring the card on July 30, 2023, the promotion announced their first international event, Rizin Landmark 7, to take place in Azerbaijan on November 4. It will also be the first major MMA event to take place in the country.\nBroadcasting and coverage.\nRizin's inaugural event was broadcast in North America on Spike TV. Other broadcasters have included SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation, Fuji Television, Fox Sports Brazil, Kix and Match TV. From 2017 to 2020, Rizin events have been streaming on FITE TV in North America and Europe. Rizin 26 to Rizin 37 would stream on LIVENow in Europe and North America.\nIn 2022, due to several controversies, Rizin would be dropped by Fuji by May of that year. Rizin would since begin broadcasting on events via PPV on their streaming service, RIZIN STREAM PASS, and various other streaming platforms in Japan. \nStarting with Super Rizin &amp; Rizin 38 in 2022, Integrated Sports would produce English-language PPVs of Rizin events for FITE.\nIn February 2024, Rizin announced the launch of a new international service, RIZIN.tv. From March, the service will be subscription-based, and will include past events.\nRules.\nMixed martial arts.\nThe rules in Rizin FF have been adopted from Pride FC with some slight modifications over the years. Matches are three rounds in length. Prior to May 2018, the first round of men's matches spanned 10 minutes, while the final two rounds lasted five minutes each. Since then matches have been three rounds of five minutes each. Victory can be attained by knockout, submission, technical knockout by referee stoppage, or by judges' decision.\nAll strikes, throws and chokes are permitted, with the exception of headbutts and strikes to the back of the head, medulla oblongata, spinal cord or genitals. Soccer kicks, knees and stomps to grounded opponents are also permitted. However, if there is a weight discrepancy of or more, the lighter fighter is allowed to choose if such ground attacks are permitted. Unlike Pride, Rizin allows the use of elbow strikes, including the 12–6 elbow.\nJudging criteria.\nFights are judged on the following criteria:\nAlthough not outlined in the Rizin rules, scorecards published on the JMOC website suggest that damage, aggressiveness and generalship are scored 50, 30 and 20 points respectively. Where the fighter has not fulfilled the element, they are given a score of zero - there are no in-betweens.\nKickboxing.\nRizin kickboxing matches are three rounds of three minutes each. Victory can be attained by knockout, technical knockout by referee stoppage, or by judges' decision. If the match goes the distance, a 10-point system is used to judge. Three knockdowns in a single round will result in a technical knockout. All forms of elbow strikes are illegal.\nChampions by nationality.\nThe division champions include only linear and true champions. Interim champions who have never become linear champions will be listed as interim champions. Fighters with multiple title reigns in a specific division will also be counted once. Runners-up are not included in tournaments champions.\nAffiliated organizations.\nRizin FF is affiliated with the following organizations:"

        "title": "American football in Japan",
        "text": "American football was introduced to Japan in the 1930s and has grown into one of the most popular sports in the country. Each team is only allowed to have three Americans per team.\nHistory.\nAmerican football was introduced in the early 1930s, when Paul Rusch, a teacher and missionary from Kentucky, who came to Japan in 1925 to help rebuild following the 1923 earthquake, George Marshall, an athletic teacher at Tokyo based Rikkyo University, and two military attaches at the US embassy, Alexander George and Merritt Booth, helped to form the first football teams at three universities in Tokyo (Waseda, Meiji, Rikkyo). In November 1934, the first football game was played between an all-star team of the three Tokyo universities and a team of the Yokohama Country and Athletic Club consisting of Americans and Britons living in Japan. The Japanese college team won the game. In 1937, a game between college all-star teams from eastern and western Japan drew a crowd of about 25,000 spectators.\nDuring World War II (1939–1945), American football in Japan came to a halt. However, soon after the war, football in Japan resumed. Rusch, who had earlier left Japan for the war, returned in 1945. During the following years, high school and junior high school teams were formed.\nThe 1970s saw American college football teams visiting Japan. In 1971, a Utah State University team led by coach Chuck Mills and future NFL quarterback Tony Adams played two exhibition matches against Japanese All-Star teams, winning by wide margins in both games. Brigham Young University played two exhibition contests in 1977, also against Japanese All-Star teams, with the American side again winning handily both times. The Cougars returned to Japan the following season to play an official regular season game against UNLV; All-American quarterback Marc Wilson threw 3 touchdown passes to lead BYU to a 28-24 victory in front of a crowd of 27,500 at Yokohama Stadium.\nFrom 1977 to 1993, a regular season game between American college teams was played in Japan, initially sponsored by Mitsubishi and known as the Mirage Bowl. The name was changed to \"Coca-Cola Classic\" in 1986 to reflect the game's new corporate sponsor at that time. Grambling State University defeated Temple University 35-32 in the initial game, held at Korakuen Stadium, with Grambling quarterback Doug Williams being named MVP. The annual game was moved to the Tokyo Dome in 1988, with Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders rushing for 332 yards and 4 touchdowns for Oklahoma State University that year against Texas Tech University, thus finishing the season with NCAA single-season records of 2,628 rushing yards and 39 touchdowns. Another record-breaking performance came in 1990, when David Klingler of the University of Houston passed for a single-game record 716 yards in a 62-45 victory over Arizona State University.\nToday, more than 17,000 players participate in a national competition for about 400 teams. There are two college football leagues, the Kanto League with teams from eastern Japan and the Kansai League with teams from western Japan. Each league has different divisions. The Division I of the Kanto League has two Conferences (A and B). The champions of the two leagues battle for the college championship in the Koshien Bowl.\nThe highest level of American Football in Japan is the X-League, an amateur league consisting of true company teams and club teams sponsored by companies. The company league was founded in 1981; since 1996, it has been called the X-League. Like the college leagues, the X-League has different divisions. The Division I has three regional divisions (East, Central, West). The two top teams of each division advance to the playoffs, called the Final 6. The championship game is called Japan X Bowl and is held in December. The X-League champion then plays against the college champion in the Rice Bowl for the Japanese national championship.\nOrganization.\nProfessional.\nThe X-League is the highest level of football in Japan. In recent years, professionals from overseas have played in the X-League, including former NFL quarterback Devin Gardner. All players in the league are amateur.\nUniversity and collegiate.\nCollege football in Japan, often played at the club level, is made up of eight leagues, spanning all four islands. The East and West champions play in the annual Koshien Bowl in Nishinomiya.\nWest (西日本).\nThe winners of the Japan X Bowl and Koshien Bowl play each other in the Rice Bowl."

        "title": "Player of the Match awards (cricket)",
        "text": "In the sport of cricket, a Man of the Match or Player of the Match award is given to an outstanding player, almost always the one who makes the most impact in the match. The term was originally used in cricket before being adopted by other sports. The award will usually be given to a player from the winning team, but if a team has lost but a player from the losing team has had an incredible performance then he can also be named as Man of the Match.\nIn Test cricket, the man of the match award became a regular feature in the mid-1980s. It is usually awarded to the player whose contribution is seen as the most important in winning the game, but there have been many instances of a player on the losing team receiving the award.\nIn Test matches, Jacques Kallis holds the record for the highest number of awards, with 23 in 166 matches, followed by Muttiah Muralitharan with 19 awards.\nIn ODI matches Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the highest number of man of the match awards, with 62 in 463 matches. Sanath Jayasuriya is second with 48.\nIn Twenty20 Internationals, Virat Kohli leads with 15 awards.\nAndrea-Mae Zepeda of Austria completed a clean sweep of POTM awards in a WT20I series against Belgium in September 2021. Hayley Matthews achieved the same feat for the West Indies against Australian in October 2023, despite her team losing the series 2–1.\nTest cricket.\nNote: Players in bold are still active in international cricket.\nOne Day International cricket.\nNote: Players in bold are still active in international cricket.\nTwenty20 International cricket.\nNote: Players in bold are still active in international cricket.\nAll formats.\nNote: Players in bold are still active in international cricket.\nShared awards.\nOccasionally in international cricket awards are shared, sometimes between two players of the same side or players of both sides. On these occasions, the commentators and other awarding authorities held on to share the awards, without giving the award to a player of the winning team. In Test cricket there have been rare instances when a joint award for man of the match or man of the series has been announced. However, in ODIs and Twenty20 internationals this is usually when a member of the losing team is the highest scorer, such as when Charles Coventry (194) and Tamim Iqbal (154) shared the award after Zimbabwe lost the match. In another interesting match held on 3 April 1996, the whole New Zealand team was awarded the Man of the Match award by adjudicator Basil Butcher who pronounced it a team performance. It was the first time that a whole team had been given the Man of the Match award.\nThere have been only three occasions, one in test cricket and two in ODI cricket, when the whole team has been awarded the man of the match by considering the team performance rather than individual performances.\nTeam Man of the Match awards.\nIn Test cricket, South Africa has been awarded Team man of the match award, in the West Indies tour in 1998/99 season. The match was won by South Africa by 351 runs and whole 11 players awarded the man of the match award.\nIn ODI cricket, New Zealand team has been awarded man of the match award for their team performances to 4 run victory against the West Indies on 3 April 1996. On 1 September 1996, Pakistan team has been awarded man of the match for their team performance against England for their 2 wicket win.\nJoint awards in Tests.\nJoint awards are sometimes given to two players, either from the same team or one from each team. As of 2017, there have been 14 instances where two players from the same team were given the Man of the Match award in Test cricket.\nUntil 2017, there have been 26 instances where one player from each team was given the Man of the Match award in Test cricket.\nThere was one rare instance where three players were given the man of the match award in Test cricket. This happened between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in February 1991 at Hamilton.\nIn one occasion in international cricket, man of the match was given to a non-player, specifically to the ground staff. In the third Test match between South Africa and New Zealand on 8 December 2000 at Johannesburg, the fifth day was delayed due to rain. However, with the help of the ground staff, managed by Chris Scott, the Head Groundsman, the play continued and the match ended in a draw.\nJoint awards in One Day Internationals.\nAs of 2020, there have been 18 instances where two players from the same team were given the Man of the Match award in ODI cricket.\nUntil 2018, there have been 14 instances where one player from each team was given the Man of the Match awards in ODI cricket."

        "title": "Pokémon World Championships",
        "text": "The Pokémon World Championships is an invite-only esports event organized by Play! Pokémon. It is held annually in August and features games from the \"Pokémon\" series such as the \"Pokémon\" video games, \"Pokémon Trading Card Game\", \"Pokémon Go, Pokémon Unite\" and \"Pokkén Tournament\" (until its 2022 edition). Players earn invitations to the World Championships based on their performance in qualifiers and other tournaments held throughout the season and compete for scholarship money, prizes and the title of World Champion. With the exception of Asia, invitations to the World Championships are administered by the Play! Pokémon program.\nHistory.\nThe Pokémon World Championships first began with the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) in 2004, which was around the time that the franchise was regaining its popularity. In 2009, Play! Pokémon began to organize competitive tournaments for the \"Pokémon\" video game series alongside the TCG, which is collectively known as the Video Game Championships (VGC). Like the TCG Championships, players compete with other players in their own age divisions (i.e. Junior, Senior and Masters) in different Premier Tournaments, and the season culminates with the best players earning an invitation to play the Pokémon World Championships in August. The tournaments in VGC are played with a different game each year, mainly, the latest \"Pokémon\" game from its main series.\nIn 2016, Play! Pokémon announced that \"Pokkén Tournament\" would have its own championship series and would be played at the Pokémon World Championships. From 2018 onward, \"Pokkén Tournament DX\" was used to support its qualifiers and competitions.\nIn 2019, it was announced that the 2020 Pokémon World Championships would take place in London, United Kingdom, the first time in which the World Championships would be held in a location outside of North America. This is likely due to the setting of \"Pokémon Sword and Shield\", which takes place in a region inspired by the United Kingdom known as Galar, and it is the set of games that would be played by the video game division of the World Championships.\nOn March 31, 2020, Play! Pokémon cancelled the 2020 Pokémon World Championships and suspended its 2020 season due to health concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. This came after earlier announcements in March which saw the cancellation of the 2020 European International Championships and part of its season between March and June 2020. On February 9, 2021, it was announced that the 2021 Pokémon World Championships would postponed till 2022 for the same reasons.\nIn early January 2022, it was confirmed that \"Pokémon Unite\" would be played at the World Championships, making it the newest MOBA game to have an official esports tournament, after \"League of Legends\".\nIn May 2022, after six seasons, Play! Pokémon announced the end of the \"Pokkén Tournament\" Championship Series after the 2022 season.\nAt the 2022 edition of the event, it was announced that the 2023 World Championships will take place in Yokohama, Japan (the basis of Vermilion City in the Kanto region). When the 2023 event takes place, it will be the first time that the World Championships visits the franchise's country of origin, as well as the first World Championships to take place in Asia.\nAt the end of the 2023 event, The Pokémon Company announced that the Pokémon World Championships will return to Hawaii, since the previous World Championships in the state was held back in 2012.\nQualification.\nThe qualifying process for the Pokémon World Championships varies each year and is dependent on a player's age division and the country in which they are located in. Players may also qualify to play on different days of the World Championships based on their performance in their respective qualifying programs; the best performing players will immediately advance to the second day of the World Championships playoffs (i.e. \"Day 2\") instead of playing through the first day (i.e. \"Day 1\").\nPlay! Pokémon program.\nPlayers located in a country with a Play! Pokémon program (i.e. in North America, Europe, Latin America and Oceania) compete in a regular schedule of tournaments for Championship Points and receive invitations when they meet a predetermined threshold of points at the end of the season.\nIn 2015, the Play! Pokémon program expanded to include countries from the continents of Latin America and Asia (except Japan and South Korea). However, on June 10, 2020, it was announced that Asia would no longer be part of the Play! Pokémon program and will have its own qualifying system towards the Pokémon World Championships.\nPokémon GO Championship Series.\nPokémon announced in October 2021 that Pokémon GO would be added during the 2022 World Championships, along with it a qualification system through the Pokémon GO Championship Series, where the top two head to the World Championships. Any trainer who reached Legend rank during Season 9 of the Pokémon GO Battle League would qualify for the GO Championship Series.\nPokémon Unite Championship Series.\nIn January 2022, \"Pokémon Unite\" producer Masaaki Hoshino confirmed that the game would be part of the roster of games to be played at the World Championships in London. For the first season of the Pokémon Unite Championship Series, there will be eleven supported Regional Zones: North America, Central America, South America-East, South America-West, Europe, Oceania, Japan, South Korea, India, and the Asia-Pacific region. These events will only be open to players aged 16 or 18, depending on the region or country they are from.\nIn each month, a series of tournaments in each Regional Zone will be held. Like other games in the World Championships, players will earn Championship Points based on their finishing position in that month's tournament. The CP can be retained by players to allow for team changes as the season carries on. The team with the most points qualifies for the Regional Championships, and the top teams from the Regional Championships qualify for a chance to compete at the Pokémon World Championships.\nIn January 2023, there were changes to the competitive structure and Regional Zones. Pokémon World Championships nearly doubled available spots from 16, to 31 teams. Regional Zones controlled by TPCi were also changed, with Central America, South America-East and South America West being changed to LATAM North, LATAM South, and Brazil. TPC had also taken control of the India and Asia-Pacific Regional Zones, and split Asia-Pacific into 2 regions; Asia-Pacific East and Asia-Pacific West. For TPCi controlled regions, the previous month's top 4 did not auto qualify for the next month's tournament finals. Additionally, an extra monthly tournament was added, the April Cup. Championship Points were also changed to include top CP earners an invite to Pokémon World Championships, ranging from top 1 to 3 in top CP earners depending on how many invites were given for a region. For TPC controlled regions, their tournament circuit began in April, with 3 monthly qualifiers. The winners of these qualifiers then participated in Regionals to earn a spot for Pokémon World Championships.\nAmong those changes, both North America and Europe were also given their first regional LAN event. Europe had a LAN event for their Aeos Cup series at European International Championships. North America were given a regional LAN event at the North America International Championships.\nIn 2023, competing countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group play each another in a best-of-three series round-robin, with the top team advancing to the Top 8 knockout stage. The final draw took place virtually on the \"Pokémon Unite\" YouTube channel on July 28, 2023. The prize pool is $500,000 in USD will be distributed among the Top 16 finishers in the championship.\nJapan &amp; South Korea.\nTournaments in Japan and South Korea are organised independently from Play! Pokémon, and as such, players from these countries have a different system of qualification.\nIn Japan, players compete for an invite to the \"Japan National Championships\" by playing in major qualifier or online tournaments held throughout the season. The best performing players of the \"Japan National Championships\" will then be selected to represent Japan in the Pokémon World Championships.\nIn South Korea, the style of qualification for the World Championships changes frequently. For example, in 2015, players would compete in the \"Korean National Championships\" and earn a World Championships invitation based on their standing in the tournament. However, in 2019, players would compete in tournaments organized by the \"Korean League\" and earn an invite based on the number of points they had accumulated by the end of the season.\nOther.\nThere are other less common methods of qualifying for the World Championships which include finishing at least top 4 or better in the prior year's World Championships or by participating in a single-elimination tournament known as the Last Chance Qualifier at the location of the World Championships itself.\n2014 World Championships.\nThe 2014 Pokémon World Championships was the sixth annual edition of the championships. The event took place in the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Washington, D.C., alongside the 2014 Pokémon Trading Card Game World Championship who were in their eleventh edition.\nThe tournament was streamed via Twitch for the first time in the tournament history and reached a viewership of more than 800,000.\nThe defending Video Game champions were Arash Ommati from Italy (Masters Division), Hayden McTavish from the United States (Senior Division), and Brendan Zheng from the United States (Junior Division). The opening ceremony of the event was attended by Junichi Masuda, the video game designer for the \"Pokémon\" franchise and a member of the board of directors of Game Freak.\nThe finals match of the Masters division is best known and remembered within the Pokémon community for Se Jun Park's victory with the inclusion and use of a Pachirisu on his team.\n2014 qualification.\nThe qualification process for the 2014 Pokémon World Championships was primarily based on Championship Points accumulated by players from official Play! Pokémon tournaments such as Premier Challenges, Regional Championships and National Championships. In addition, the top 4 players of the 2013 Pokémon World Championships in each division, and the top 4 players of a tournament known as the 'Last Chance Qualifier' will also receive an invitation to play in the World Championships.\nThe invitations for the Masters Division of the tournament were distributed in the following manner:\nMost of the invitations did not include a fully paid trip to the tournament, and as a result several players could not attend the tournament.\n2014 tournament structure.\nResults.\nSix rounds of Swiss was played by 60 players in the tournament, and each round was played with a set of best-of-three matches. The top 8 players after the Swiss rounds advances to the best-of-three Single Elimination matches.\nThe defending World Champion Arash Ommati and former three-time World Champion Ray Rizzo did not advance to the single elimination rounds.\n2015 World Championships.\nThe 2015 Pokémon World Championships was the seventh annual edition of the championships. The event was held alongside the Pokémon Trading Card Game World Championships at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, Massachusetts.\nThe tournament was transmitted with live streaming from the official Pokémon Twitch channel. The defending Video Game champions for the year were Se Jun Park from South Korea (Masters Division), Nikolai Zielinsky from the United States (Senior Division) and Kota Yamamoto from Japan (Junior Division).\n2015 qualification.\nPlayers could only gain an invitation to play in the Video Game World Championships by either being the 2014 Pokémon World Champions, or by obtaining enough Championship Points in their respective geographic zone designated by Play! Pokémon. However, the only exception to this rule are for players from Japan and South Korea, as their tournaments are not overseen by Play! Pokémon and their invites are governed through a different system of qualification.\nSince 2014, players were able to earn Championship Points from various tournaments within their geographical region. The tournaments vary in scale, ranging from local Premier Challenges to state-level Regional Championships and finally the large-scale National Championships. The number of points awarded varies with scale, and players who earn these points are ranked and divided into zones such as North America, Europe and South Africa. This year, two new zones (Latin America and Asia-Pacific) were introduced.\nThe 2015 Pokémon Video Game World Championship was intended to be played under two Swiss tournaments and one single-elimination tournament which would then determine the 2015 World Champions. As such, there are two types of invites:\nAs an example, the invitations for the Masters Division were distributed as follows:\n2015 tournament structure.\nThe Video Game Championships consisted of two Swiss tournaments and one single elimination tournament played across three days.\nOn Friday (Day 1), all players who earned an invitation without a Day 1 bye were entered into a Swiss tournament, where players with two or fewer losses would advance onto the next round. The second Swiss tournament was then played on Saturday (Day 2), where players who advanced from Day 1 were joined by players who received an invitation with a Day 1 bye.\nAt the end of the Day 2 Swiss tournament, the top eight players played in single elimination rounds until the last two remain. The finals took place on Sunday (Day 3).\nWeapons controversy.\nDuring the 2015 World Championships, two Trading Card Game competitors from Iowa (Kevin Norton, 18, and James Stumbo, 27) brought weapons in their vehicle, which were recovered by the police. The two posted status updates and images of their weaponry on social media, which were noticed by various \"Pokémon\" fans who treated them as supposed threats against the tournament. The updates were reported to the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC), who promptly seized their automobile and then stopped them at the door and barred them from entering the Hynes Convention Center on Thursday evening. Police executed a search warrant on Friday and Norton and Stumbo were arrested at their Red Roof Inn room in Saugus just after midnight on Saturday, August 22, 2015. The two were arrested on charges of unlicensed possession of firearms and ammunition, and were initially held without bail. The weapons recovered were a recently purchased Remington shotgun, an AR-15, a hunting knife and several hundred rounds of ammunition. They pleaded not guilty at their arraignment on November 10, 2015, and their bail was set at $150,000. On December 2, 2015, their trial was set for May 9, 2016, however, in early April 2016, their trial was postponed to November 2016. Following the release of \"Pokémon Go\" in July 2016, Stumbo's attorney indicated that the case would be resolved soon. Norton and Stumbo were later sentenced to two years in prison with an additional two years probation once their prison term ends.\n2016 World Championships.\nThe 2016 Pokémon World Championships was the eighth annual edition of the championships. The event was held at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis in San Francisco, California, from August 19 to August 21.\nFor the first time in the tournament history, the \"Pokkén Tournament\" invitational was featured alongside the Video Game Championships (VGC) and Trading Card Game (TCG) tournaments. Side events and an official store with event merchandise occurred alongside the event.\nThe defending Video Game champions were Shoma Honami from Japan (Masters Division), Mark McQuillan from the United Kingdom (Senior Division) and Kotone Yasue from Japan (Junior Division). The defending Trading Card Game champions were Jacob Van Wagner from the United States (Masters Division), Patrick Martinez from the United States (Senior Division), and Rowan Stavenow from Canada.\nAge divisions and qualifications.\nBoth the Pokémon VGC and TCG were divided into three age divisions: the \"Junior Division\" (born 2005 or later), the \"Senior Division\" (born between 2001 and 2004), and the \"Masters Division\" (born 2000 or earlier). For the \"Pokkén Tournament\" invitational, players were grouped into either the \"Senior Division\" (born 2001 or later) or \"Masters Division\" (born 2000 or earlier).\nThe process of obtaining an invitation is primarily based on Championship Points. Players could earn Championship Points by performing in select online and live tournaments held throughout the 2016 season (between September 2015 and July 2016). Players from Japan and South Korea were excluded from this rule as these countries had their own method of qualification not based on Championship Points.\nPlay! Pokémon divided players into five different rating zones: US and Canada, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific and South Africa. Different zones had different Championship Points requirements due to the distribution of events around the world.\nThere are two possible invitations players could obtain:\n'Day Two' invites were usually accompanied by travel awards and stipends paid by Play! Pokémon.\nTrading Card Game Championship qualifications.\nThe following table shows the Championship Points requirement for an invitation to the 2016 World Championships:\nPlayers in Japan and South Korea were awarded invitations based on each country's organized play system.\nVideo Game Championship qualifications.\nFor the Masters Division, the following table lists the Championship Points requirement for an invitation to the 2016 World Championships:\n2016 tournament structure.\nThe Video Game Championships consisted of two Swiss tournaments and one single elimination tournament played across three days.\nOn Friday (Day 1), all players who earned an invitation without a Day 1 bye were entered into a Swiss tournament, where players with two or fewer losses would advance onto the next round. The second Swiss tournament was then played on Saturday (Day 2), where players who advanced from Day 1 were joined by players who received an invitation with a Day 1 bye.\nAt the end of the Day 2 Swiss tournament, players with two or fewer losses advanced to play in single elimination rounds until the last two remain. The finals took place on Sunday (Day 3)."

It is in charge of promoting the sport in Algeria, organizes international matches for the national team, and is involved in educating and training players and officials. Algeria has never participated in the Rugby World Cup qualifiers. Their best result to date was a 50-0 win against Egypt and Libya, both in a Cairo international tournament in 2010. \nFAR was accepted as an affiliate member of World Rugby in 2019 and became a full member in 2021.\nHistory.\nDuring the French presence in Algeria before 1962, rugby union had its followers either in Oran, Guelma, Algiers or Annaba where clubs like Stade Oranais, RIJA, USMMC, AGVGA or ES Guelma were existent. Rugby had its moments of glory and many Algerian players have been able to achieve successful professional careers abroad, especially in France; but discipline disappeared after the independence of Algeria due to lack of multiple items till 1972 when it disappeared completely.\nDuring the beginning of the 2000s, The Algerian Rugby Clubs Committee was established to revive the discipline before creating the federation. On 17 November 2015 the federation was created in Algiers during a constitutive general assembly chaired by Mustapha Larfaoui, honorary president of the Algerian Olympic and Sports Committee and attended by representatives of 18 clubs of 16 wilayas. Sofiane Benhassen was elected first president of the federation.\nIn December 2016, Benhassen reported that they would begin a national ruby championship among 20 rugby union club teams, starting in 2017."

        "text": "Jason Darius Crowe (born August 24, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player. He graduated from Cal State Northridge in 1999 and played 13 years as a professional in Europe, South America, Iran, Australia and New Zealand.\nCollege career.\nCrowe attended Inglewood High School in Inglewood, California, before playing his first season of college basketball at Los Angeles Trade–Technical College in 1995–96. He transferred to American University in April 1996, signing with the Eagles men's basketball program for the 1996–97 season. As a sophomore in 1996–97, Crowe averaged 4.0 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 21 games.\nIn 1997, Crowe transferred again, this time to Cal State Northridge. He subsequently sat out the 1997–98 season due to NCAA transfer regulations, joining the Matadors squad for the 1998–99 season as a redshirted junior. Crowe was expected to make the Matadors a potent offensive threat, but despite flashes of brilliance, the transition was not as smooth as coach Bobby Braswell would have liked. While he often dished out great assists, he also had a high turnover count, which frustrated Braswell. Crowe finished the 1998–99 season with averages of 4.8 points, 2.8 assists, 3.6 assists and 1.6 steals in 29 games. He did not return to Cal State Northridge for the 1999–2000 season after graduating from the school.\nProfessional career.\nEarly years.\nCrowe first joined the La Crosse Bobcats of the Continental Basketball Association for the 1999–2000 season, but was released on November 12, 1999. For the 2000–01 season, Crowe moved to Serbia to play for Sloga.\nIn early 2002, Crowe moved to the Ukraine and signed with BC Kyiv where he spent the rest of the 2001–02 season. In 10 games for Kyiv, he averaged 13.4 points, 4.7 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 3.0 steals per game. Later that year, in October, Crowe joined the Los Angeles Clippers for their training camp. Unfortunately, he did not make the team's final roster and in January 2003, he re-joined BC Kyiv. He had another stint with the Clippers in October 2003, but again did not get past training camp. In February 2004, he joined the Long Beach Jam of the American Basketball Association.\nCrowe moved to Hungary for the 2004–05 season, originally signing with Klima-Vill Kaposvar SE, but was released by the club prior to the start of the regular season. He later joined Szolnoki Olaj in February 2005 and appeared in five games for the club, averaging 9.4 points, 2.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game.\nCrowe moved to Iran for the 2005–06 season, signing with Petrochimi Bandar Imam on a $30,000 a month contract. He later cited that his stint in Iran was his worst experience, stating \"There's absolutely no social life [in Iran]. None. I was over there just trying to get through and make it home.\" His wife, Irene, spent the season with him in Iran, but due to the Islamic-ruling government which requires strict clothing cover for women in public, she often did not leave the house for three to four weeks at a time. In 36 games for Petrochimi, he averaged 22.3 points per game.\nNew Zealand and Australia.\nCrowe's next stint brought him back to Europe, trialling with Polish club Anwil Włocławek in November 2006. He ended up signing with SKS Starogard Gdański and played 11 games for the club before departing in February 2007. In those 11 games, he averaged 9.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.9 steals per game. He subsequently moved to New Zealand in May where he joined the Waikato Pistons for the 2007 New Zealand NBL season. In eight regular season games for the Pistons, Crowe averaged 20.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.3 assists and a league-leading 3.8 steals per game. He also recorded 28 points, eight rebounds and seven steals in the Pistons' semi-final loss to the Nelson Giants.\nDue to his impressive play in the New Zealand NBL, Crowe was nabbed by the Gold Coast Blaze of the Australian NBL for the 2007–08 season. He appeared in all 31 games for the Blaze in 2007–08, averaging 16.5 points, 6.3 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game. He returned to the Pistons for the 2008 New Zealand NBL season and had a career-best stint. His season began with a Waikato club record 16 assists in a win over the Nelson Giants, just hours after arriving from Los Angeles. He followed that up with three triple-doubles throughout the year, recording his first with 25 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists against Taranaki in round three, his second with 30 points, 12 rebounds and 10 points against Wellington in round 10, and third against the Canterbury in round 12 with 44 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. He earned numerous awards for his efforts, garnering Most Outstanding Guard, Assist Champion, All-Star Five honors, was named Player of the Week five times, and ended the regular season atop the Player Power Rankings by a healthy margin. To cap off the season, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player and led the Pistons to the championship, winning the best-of-three Finals series 2–0 over the Wellington Saints. In 18 regular season games, he averaged 21.7 points, 7.2 rebounds, a league-leading 8.3 assists and 3.1 steals per game.\nLatin America and Bulgaria.\nIn January 2009, Crowe signed with Pioneros de Quintana Roo of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional. The following month, he moved to Venezuela and joined Cocodrilos de Caracas, which again was a one-month stint. Later that year, he signed with Ukrainian team BC Dnipro for the 2009–10 season. In 30 games for Dnipro in 2009–10, he averaged 16.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 7.7 assists and 2.2 steals per game.\nIn September 2010, Crowe signed with Levski Sofia of Bulgaria for the 2010–11 season. In 24 league games for Levski in 2010–11, he averaged 11.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 2.4 steals per game.\nReturn to New Zealand.\nIn May 2011, Crowe re-joined the Waikato Pistons for the rest of the 2011 New Zealand NBL season. In 12 regular season games, he averaged 13.2 points, 5.1 rebounds, a league-leading 7.2 assists and a league-leading 3.3 steals per game. The Pistons came into the semi-finals on an 11-game winning streak, but were defeated 95–86 in an upset win by the Hawke's Bay Hawks. Crowe scored 10 points in the loss. He earned All-Star Five honors for a second time, and was named Assist Champion for a second time also.\nFinal season.\nOn September 29, 2011, Crowe signed with Phoenix Hagen of Germany for the 2011–12 season. However, he was released by the club in December 2011 after appearing in just nine games. In those nine games, he averaged career lows with 7.7 points, 3.9 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.4 steals per game.\nIn February 2012, Crowe signed with the Wellington Saints for the 2012 New Zealand NBL season. In 18 games for the Saints (16 regular season, 2 playoff), he averaged 17.3 points, 6.4 rebounds, 8.7 assists and 2.8 steals per game. Crowe was named Assist Champion for a third time, and guided his team to the Grand Final where they were defeated by the Auckland Pirates.\nPost-playing career.\nIn June 2014, Crowe was named the head coach of the Verbum Dei High School basketball team."

        "text": "The Bosnia and Herzegovina men's national sitting volleyball team (; ; ) represents Bosnia and Herzegovina in international sitting volleyball competitions and friendly matches. Bosnia is one of the dominant forces in sitting volleyball worldwide, alongside Iran. The team won a bronze medal, during ECVD European Championships in 1997 in Tallinn. It took nearly two decades later for the nation to win a medal outside the sport of sitting volleyball when Amel Tuka won bronze during 2015 World Championships in Athletics.\nThe team is the most decorated in Bosnia and Herzegovina sport having won 2 paralympic volleyball gold medals, 3 paralympic silver medals, 3 World Cup titles, and 9 won European Championships straight. The team won World titles and European titles either side of winning Paralympics Gold in 2004 Athens. The team is a member of the world (WOVD) and European (ECVD) sitting volleyball governing bodies.\nIt is governed by the Association of sitting volleyball of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\"Savez sjedeće odbojke BiH\"). Until 1992, Bosnian players like Ševko Nuhanović were part of the Yugoslav national sitting volleyball team.\nHistory.\nPrior to 1992, during the Yugoslavia days, the beginnings of the team started to take its form. Players were part of Sarajevo based \"Uporni Sitting Volleyball Club\" which were champions of Yugoslavia three times in a row. Bosnia and Herzegovina men's sitting volleyball team includes athletes who were deeply affected by the Bosnian War (6 April 1992 – 14 December 1995). Due to the large number of people injured in the conflict, the country started to invest more in Paralympic sports. Captain Sabahudin Delalić fought for the Bosnian army and lost part of his right leg after a wall fell on him. Safet Alibašić lost one of his legs when he stepped on a landmine.\nThe first major tournament participation came in during 1995 European championship. During its qualification phase in early December 1994, the team (all players from Sarajevo club SDI Spid), traveled to Zagreb on a bus riddled with bullet holes in temperatures of 17 degrees below zero. Bosnia along with Austria were the only nations to travel to play Croatia in the qualification tournament (out of 11 invited). Croatia finished undefeated with victories over Austria 3:0 (15:5, 15:8, 16:14) and Bosnia (15:6, 15:8, 15:11). Bosnia beat Austria, however all 3 nations qualified for the finals.\nTeam made their Paralympic Games debut at Sydney 2000 and won silver. There were five total Paralympic podium finishes in sitting volleyball for Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are the only medals in Olympic and Paralympic Games as an independent nation (from Yugoslavia). The 800 metres distance runner Amel Tuka holds the only other prestigious medal for Bosnia and Herzegovina, a bronze at 2015 World Championships in Athletics in Beijing.\nOn 21 June 2014, Edin Džeko congratulated the BiH men's national sitting volleyball team after they won \"2014 Sitting Volleyball World Championships\" title, stating \"You are our pride and inspiration\".\nOn 10 September 2012, Basketball Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina congratulated the BiH sitting volleyball team upon their paralympic gold medal win at 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, saying \"You are a pride of our nation\",\n as did NFSBiH (normalization committee) with Ivica Osim at the head.\nSuccess formula\nHeight, experience and strong club league are key to success in the sitting volleyball. 80% of the Bosnian national team players come from Sarajevo based and Europe's top two sitting volleyball club sides; SDI Spid and OKI Fantomi. Height is a critical aspect of successful team as was case with Iranian national team winning gold over Bosnia at Rio 2016 Paralympics final due to height advantage of tallest Paralympian Morteza Mehrzadselakjani at \"2.46m (8ft 1in)\", giving his team an advantage in his ability to both block at the net and fire over returns from a much higher trajectory. In the Rio final; Mehrzadselakjani was top scorer for Iran with 28 points. Safet Alibašić top scored for BIH with 16 points. Fastest serve came from Adnan Manko at 68 km/h. Sport investment, financial backing and sprint velocities are other key factors.\nStyle of play\nBosnia play an attacking style of volleyball.\nNickname\nA popular nickname of all Bosnian sport players and/or teams is the \"Zmajevi\" or \"Dragons\" in English alluding to the famous Bosnian general Husein Gradaščević who fought for Bosnian independence and who was known as the \"Dragon of Bosnia\". In foreign media, they are sometimes referred to as the \"Golden Lilies\", in reference to the golden lily featured on the coat of arms of the influential Bosnian medieval Kotromanić dynasty.\nSponsorship\nTeam is sponsored by Sarajevo based telecommunication company BH Telecom d.d. since 1996.\nPlayers.\nPlayers called up for 2016 Summer Paralympics:\nHead coach: Mirza Hrustemović\nPlayers called up for 2015 European Championships:\nSabahudin Delalić (captain), Dževad Hamzić, Asim Medić, Safet Alibašić, Beniz Kadrić, Ermin Jusufović, Muhamed Kapetanović, Nizam Čančar, Ismet Godinjak, Adnan Manko, Mirzet Duran, Adnan Kešmer, Edin Džino, Armin Šehić, Jasmin Brkić, Adin Likić, Damir Grbić.\nPlayers called up for 2012 Summer Paralympics:\nPlayers called up for 2008 Summer Paralympics:\nSafet Alibašić, Sabahudin Delalić (captain), Mirzet Duran, Esad Durmišević, Ismet Godinjak, Dževad Hamzić, Ermin Jusufović, Hidaet Jusufović (libero), Zikret Mahmić, Adnan Manko, Asim Medić, Ejub Mehmedović.\nPlayers called up for 2004 Summer Paralympics:\nDževad Hamzić, Nedzad Salkić, Safet Alibašić, Sabahudin Delalić, Ermin Jusufović, Zikret Mahmić, Fikret Causević, Asim Medić, Esad Durmisević, Ejub Mehmedović, Adnan Manko, Ismet Godinjak.\nPlayers called up for 2000 Summer Paralympics:\nDževad Hamzić, Nedžad Salkić, Abid Čišija, Sabahudin Delalić, Nevzet Alić, Zikret Mahmić, Fikret Čausević, Asim Medić, Edin Ibraković, Ševko Nuhanović, Adnan Manko, Ismet Godinjak.\nThe players in the B&amp;H national side predominantly are selected from two biggest clubs from Bosnia and Herzegovina:KSO Spid Sarajevo and OKI Fantomi Sarajevo \"(Volleyball Club Invalids Phantoms)\".

The 2016 event marks the fifth time that the Championships have been held in the United States, and the second time in Everett (the first being 2012).\nThe event served as the second international team elite competition for the U.S. women's national team (after the City of Jesolo Trophy) and the first for the men's team.\nBackground.\nOn March 17, 2015, American national gymnastics governing body USA Gymnastics announced that Everett had been selected to host the Championships for the 2016 edition – a result of the successful event in 2012. USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny said the 2012 championships were \"the best Pacific Rim gymnastics event we've [USA Gymnastics] ever held\". The 2012 event drew an attendance of 20,343 over three days competition; more than four times higher than the previous 2008 event in San Jose, California. The 2012 event amassed a profit of around $2.5 million.\nPromotion.\nIn February 2016, Olympians Carly Patterson and Shawn Johnson visited the Seattle metropolitan area to promote the event at a sports award ceremony.\nVenues.\nOpened on September 27, 2003, as the Everett Events Center, the arena is home to the WHL hockey team Everett Silvertips and the Tilted Thunder Rail Birds roller derby team.

The arena had a capacity of 6,200 for the 2012 event but some arena floor area was used to cater for additional seating.\nUnlike the 2012 event where all events were contested at the Xfinity Arena, the organizers have decided to use nearby Everett Community College to host the rhythmic gymnastics events. Although it hasn't been confirmed, it is thought that the events will take place in the Gray Wolf Hall. The college's athletic mascot is a Trojan and the hall hosts volleyball matches.\nBroadcast.\nNBC Sports televised the event. The women's team and all-around competitions were aired through tape-delayed coverage on NBC.\nAdditionally, 2008 Olympians Samantha Peszek and Jonathan Horton, along with Evan Heiter, presented live YouTube coverage of the competition.\nParticipating nations.\nThe following nations participated in the competition:"

        "text": "Craig Francis Smith (born December 14, 1972) is an American college basketball coach who is the head coach for the Utah Utes men's team of the Pac-12 Conference. He served as an assistant for Tim Miles at four schools – Mayville State, North Dakota State, Colorado State, and Nebraska. Smith was also the head coach at Mayville State from 2004 to 2007, at South Dakota from 2014 to 2018, and at Utah State from 2018 to 2021.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn in Stephen, Minnesota, Smith graduated from the University of North Dakota in 1996 with a bachelor's degree in secondary education and Northern State University in South Dakota with a master's degree in education in 1999.\nCoaching career.\nBeginnings as assistant coach (1996–2004).\nSmith began his coaching career in 1996 as an assistant coach for one season at Mayville State University, an NAIA school in North Dakota. This was the first of several coaching roles under Tim Miles.\nIn 1997, Smith enrolled in graduate school at Northern State, an NCAA Division II school in South Dakota, and became a graduate assistant with its men's basketball team. Returning to North Dakota, Smith was an assistant coach at Minot State from 1998 to 2001.\nIn 2001, Smith reunited with Miles at then-NCAA Division II North Dakota State, where he was an assistant coach and director of operations for three seasons.\nMayville State (2004–2007).\nAfter three seasons at North Dakota State, Smith returned to Mayville State, this time as head coach in 2004. Inheriting a team that had one win in the previous season, Smith led the Comets to 17 wins and a berth in the NAIA Division II Tournament in his first season of 2004–05.\nSmith's second season as Mayville State head coach in 2005–06 had a 28–6 record, good enough to break the record for most wins in program history. Mayville won the Dakota Athletic Conference (DAC) regular season and conference titles and qualified for the NAIA Tournament for the second straight season, this time making the quarterfinals. With a 27–9 record in Smith's final season 2006–07, Mayville State won both DAC titles again and made the championship round of the NAIA tournament as a no. 13 seed. Smith won NAIA Division II Coach of the Year honors in 2007 and DAC Coach of the Year Honors in 2006 and 2007.\nAssistant coach at Colorado State and Nebraska (2007–2014).\nSmith got his first NCAA Division I job on April 10, 2007, as director of operations at Colorado State, his third association with Tim Miles. Miles promoted Smith to a full assistant coach in 2008. During his time at Colorado State, Smith helped the team qualify for the 2010 CBI, 2011 NIT, and 2012 NCAA tournament.\nOn April 25, 2012, Smith followed Miles to Nebraska after Miles took the head coaching job there. Smith helped Nebraska make the 2014 NCAA tournament.\nSouth Dakota (2014–2018).\nSmith became a head coach again on March 24, 2014, when South Dakota athletic director David Herbster named Smith men's basketball head coach. Following a 12–18 season in 2013–14, South Dakota went 17–16 (10–8 in Summit League play) in Smith's first season of 2014–15. In 2016–17, Smith won Summit League Coach of the Year honors after South Dakota won the Summit League regular season title and qualified for the 2017 NIT. Smith's last season in 2017 with the Coyotes ended 26–9, with a 2nd-place finish in the Summit League both in the regular season and conference tournament, the Coyotes would later fall to North Texas in the 2018 College Basketball Invitational first round 77–90.\nUtah State (2018–2021).\nOn March 26, 2018, Smith was announced as Utah State's new head coach after the firing of Tim Duryea. In just his first season at the school, he led the Aggies to a share of the Mountain West regular-season title, as well as the tournament title. This performance earned them their first appearance in the NCAA tournament since 2011. The team repeated as Mountain West tournament champions in 2020, though the NCAA tournament was cancelled amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Smith earned his third consecutive NCAA tournament appearance with the Aggies with an at-large bid.\nUtah (2021–present).\nSmith was hired to be the new head coach of the Utah Utes men's basketball team on March 27, 2021."

        "text": "The men's coxed pair rowing competition at the 1980 Summer Olympics took place at Krylatskoye Sports Complex Canoeing and Rowing Basin, Moscow, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. The event was held from 20 to 27 July. There were 11 boats (33 competitors) from 11 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Harald Jährling, Friedrich-Wilhelm Ulrich, and coxswain Georg Spohr of East Germany, the first men to successfully repeat as Olympic champions in the event (Conn Findlay was the only previous man to have two gold medals in the coxed pair, winning non-consecutively in 1956 and 1964 with different crews). It was also the first time that a crew of the same three men earned multiple medals of any colour. East Germany's three straight medals matched the United States (with gold in 1932, 1956, and 1964) for most among nations to that point. Silver went to the Soviet Union again, though with an entirely different team from its 1976 runner-up crew; the silver medalists this time were Viktor Pereverzev, Gennadi Kryuçkin, and cox Aleksandr Lukyanov. Duško Mrduljaš, Zlatko Celent, and cox Josip Reić earned Yugoslavia's first medal in the event with their bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nSix of the 18 competitors from the 1976 coxed pair Final A returned, two full crews: gold medal winners Harald Jährling, Friedrich-Wilhelm Ulrich, and cox Georg Spohr of East Germany and fourth-place finishers Rumen Khristov, Tsvetan Petkov, and cox Todor Kishev of Bulgaria. The East Germans were heavily favoured, with the nation having taken the gold medals in the 1972 and 1976 Olympics and 1975, 1978, and 1979 World Championships (Spohr was on the 1979 Worlds team; the three together had finished second at the 1977 Worlds). Czechoslovakia was the primary challenger, with two consecutive Worlds silvers as well as Olympic medals in 1972 (silver) and 1976 (bronze); Josef Plamínek, Milan Škopek, and Oldřich Hejdušek were the 1979 runner-up crew.\nIreland made its debut in the event. France made its 13th appearance, most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. The competition consisted of two main rounds (semifinals and finals) as well as a repechage after the semifinals.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nWinner of each heat advanced to Final A. The remaining teams must compete in repechage for the remaining spots in the \"A\" final or be placed in the \"B\" final.\nRepechage.\nThe top two finishers in each heat advanced to the \"A\" final. All others went to the \"B\" final, out of medal contention."

It was the only event of the 1981–82 snooker season which carried world ranking points. Embassy, a British cigarette company, sponsored the tournament, and the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) governed the organisation of the event. It had a prize fund of £110,000, with the winner receiving £25,000.\nThe defending champion Steve Davis had defeated Doug Mountjoy with a score of 18–12 in the previous year's final. In 1982, Davis lost 1–10 to Tony Knowles in the first round. Alex Higgins won his second world title by defeating Ray Reardon 18–15 in the final. Ten century breaks were made during the tournament, the highest of which was a 143 scored by Willie Thorne.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and is the official world championship of the game of snooker. Snooker was founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. The sport was originated by players from the United Kingdom, and later spread to players from Europe and the Commonwealth. In more modern times, the sport has transferred to being played worldwide, specifically in Southeast Asia, such as in China, Thailand and Hong Kong. Joe Davis won the first World Championship, held in 1927 at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the tournament has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield.\nThe 1982 World Championship was promoted by Mike Watterson and governed by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). Thirty-two professional players competed in one-on-one single-elimination matches that were played over several . The players were selected for the event using a combination of world snooker rankings and a qualification event. The defending champion was Steve Davis, who defeated Doug Mountjoy 18–12 in the 1981 championship final.\nThere were 67 entrants for the 1982 tournament including the qualifying event, a new record. This was the first world championship to have 32 players in the first round. In 1980, the number of players in the main event had been increased to 24, up from 16 in 1979. In 1980 and 1981, the top eight players received a bye into the second round. It was the only event of the season that carried ranking points. These were only awarded from the last-16 round onwards. British cigarette company Embassy sponsored the tournament.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money on offer for 1982 is shown below. The total of £110,000 was a new record for the world championship.\nTournament summary.\nFirst round.\nThe contest's first round took place between 30 April and 6 May, each best-of-19 frames match being played over two . Defending champion Steve Davis was the bookmakers' favourite to win the tournament, with odds of 2/5.

Knowles won the next two frames by more than 60 points, giving him a 4–0 lead during the mid-session interval. Without making a significant , Davis won the fifth frame. Knowles then compiled a break of 67, the highest of the session, to win the sixth frame. Davis's highest break of the first session was 32, and he finished 1–8 behind.

Bill Werbeniuk led John Bear 7–2 after their first session; Bear won the next three frames to reduce the lead to 7–5, but Werbeniuk ultimately won 10–7.

Francisco then won three successive frames, winning 10–7.\nEight-time champion Fred Davis, the event's oldest competitor at the age of 68, lost 7–10 to Dean Reynolds, who at 19 was the youngest participant. After defeat in the first three frames, Davis had led 6–5. Ray Reardon faced Jim Donnelly, the first Scottish player to play at the Crucible, and built a 6–3 lead over him. Reardon lost the subsequent two frames but achieved victory in the next four, allowing him to win 10–5. John Virgo defeated Mike Hallett 10–4 after leading 7–2 in the first session. Terry Griffiths, the bookmakers' next favourite after Steve Davis's elimination, led 4–2 but finished his first session behind 4–5 to Willie Thorne, who had never won a match in his six earlier Crucible appearances. Thorne defeated Griffiths 10–6 and compiled a break of 106, which was the first century break of the 1982 tournament. John Spencer defeated John Dunning 10–4.

Doug Mountjoy defeated Rex Williams, the reigning world billiards champion, 10–3.\nDavid Taylor led Patsy Fagan 6–3 overnight then extended his lead to 7–3 before Fagan levelled at 7–7. Taylor asked Fagan, who was 7–8 behind, to play again after making a shot while failing to escape from a . He failed to pot the and hit the cue ball again as it was still moving, disturbing other balls from their position. The referee could have interpreted this as Fagan conceding the frame but instead replaced the balls. Fagan went on to win the frame. From 9–9, Fagan made the highest break of their match, 78, to win the deciding frame. Perrie Mans won 10–8 over Tony Meo, his first win at the Crucible since the 1978 semi-final. Jimmy White, who started his match against Cliff Thorburn with a break of 102 in the first frame, led 7–2 in the first session and won the match 10–4. Kirk Stevens defeated Jack Fitzmaurice 10–4. In the first round, five of the top eight seeds were eliminated: Steve Davis (seeded 1), Thorburn (2), Griffiths (3), Dennis Taylor (5), and David Taylor (7). This included the previous three world champions, who were also the top three seeds.\nSecond round.\nThe second round took place between 5 and 10 May; each match was played over three sessions as the best-of-25 frames. Knowles defeated Miles 13–7. Charlton led Werbeniuk 6–1 and 11–4, and won 13–5.

Reardon was 6–2 and later 10–6 against Virgo, winning 13–8.\nThorne, after being 5–3 ahead of Spencer after the first session, made a break of 122 during the second and went on to win the match 13–5. Higgins won the first three frames of his match against Mountjoy, two of them on the final black ball after trailing on points in each of them, and finished their first session leading 6–2. Higgins moved to 9–7 ahead and Mountjoy then won three consecutive frames. Higgins then won the next three for 12–10. Mountjoy forced a deciding frame by winning the next two and was nearly 40 points ahead in the decider, but Higgins won the frame to win the match 13–12. Stevens defeated Fagan 13–7, having led 10–6 at the end of their second session. White led Mans 5–3 before winning 13–6.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals took place from 9 to 11 May; each match was played over three sessions as the best-of-25 frames. White led Stevens 5–3 in their first session, extending this to 10–6, and winning the match 13–9. Reardon led Francisco 6–2 and 10–6 after their sessions, and won 13–8. Thorne was 3–5 behind Higgins; despite scoring breaks of 143the highest of the tournamentin the 9th frame, and 112 in the 16th frame, he still trailed 7–9 at the end of the second session. Higgins won the match 13–10, compiling a 68 break in the last frame.\nKnowles led Charlton 5–3 after their first session and 10–6 after the second. Knowles then won the first frame of the third session to lead 11–6. Charlton narrowed the lead to 9–11 and won another frame to score 10–11 when Knowles missed a routine green ball.

Charlton took the following frame as well, then won the match 13–11 with a break of 58, concluding a seven-frame winning streak.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals took place from 12 to 14 May, with both matches played over four sessions as the best-of-31 frames. White, by defeating Stevens in the quarter-finals, had become the youngest-ever player to reach a world championship semi-final. Higgins, his opponent, won the opening frame of the match. White made breaks of 60 and 38, and won the second frame, before Higgins built a 4–1 lead. With breaks of 63, 69 and 44, White drew level at 4–4 by the end of the first session. White won the first four frames of the second session, compiling breaks of 69 in the first and 52 in the second. Higgins had a chance in the second frame but failed to pot the last red ball and conceded the frame. After the mid-session interval, Higgins made a break of 61 and won the 13th frame, and also took the 14th frame after White missed an easy black. After White missed a red ball, Higgins also won the next frame, ending the day one frame behind at 7–8. In the third session, White took three of the first four frames, compiling a break of 89 in the fourth of these to lead 11–8, Higgins then won the next three to level the match at 11–11 by the end of the session.\nWhite won the first frame of the fourth session and Higgins a in the following frame, which he went on to win. From 12–12, the next two frames were shared for 13–13. Higgins scored only nine points across two frames as White moved into a 15–13 lead with three frames to play. Higgins narrowed his deficit to one frame with a break of 72. In the 30th frame, White was 59 points ahead when he missed a simple red. Higgins then made a break of 69, showing excellent potting but poor positional play that is described in the book \"Masters of the Baize\" (2005) as \"arguably the greatest clearance of all time\" to take the match to a deciding frame. In the last frame, Higgins made a break of 59 to win the match 16–15.\nCharlton gained a 3–0 lead over Reardon. Reardon, however, made breaks of 50, 47, 48 and 35 in the next four frames and finished the first session 4–3 ahead. Charlton scored a break of 83 in the first frame of the second session, levelling the score at 4–4. Reardon again moved a frame ahead with a break of 98. Charlton gained a two-frame lead at 7–5 by winning three consecutive frames but lost the 13th frame after snookering himself on the yellow ball. Reardon then equalised the match at 7–7, scoring a break of 59 in the last frame of the session. In the third session, the score went to 8–8 and Reardon then compiled breaks of 94 and 77 to win the next two frames. Charlton again equalised with a 54 break in the 17th frame and by winning the 18th frame on the pink. Reardon took the lead with a 93 clearance at 11–10 but Charlton won the last frame of the session with a break of 64 that started with a fluke. In the fourth session, Reardon had won five successive frames to win the match 16–11, making a 98 break in the fourth frame.\nFinal.\nThe final between Reardon and Higgins was played on 15 and 16 May as the best-of-35 frames over four sessions. Reardon, a six-time champion, had never lost in the world championship final. It was Higgins's fourth world final following his win in 1972 and his losing appearances in the 1976 and 1980 finals. The 1982 final was a rematch of the 1976 final, which Reardon won 27–16. In the opening session, in which both players made a number of errors, Reardon built a 5–3 lead. Higgins had compiled a break of 118 in the fourth frame to equalise at 2–2. In the second session, Reardon was 6–4 ahead when he failed to pot the pink ball; Higgins won that frame and the next to equalise at 6–6. Reardon won the next frame but Higgins took the lead at 8–7, the first day finishing with Higgins 10–7 up.\nOn the second day, Reardon won the first frame with a break of 95 and also won the next frame. Higgins won the next two frames to gain a 12–9 lead, which Reardon reduced by winning frames 22 and 23, the session ending with Higgins leading 13–12. In the fourth and final session, Higgins won the first frame and took the second after Reardon missed an easy yellow. Now 15–12 ahead, Higgins missed a pot that allowed Reardon to win the frame and narrow Higgins's lead to two frames, 15–13. With Higgins showing signs of nervousness, Reardon won another two frames to level at 15–15, having required Higgins to in the second of these. Higgins then won the 31st frame 79–0, the 32nd 112–0 with breaks of 38 and 73, and then won the match with a clearance of 135. A tearful Higgins summoned his wife and baby daughter from the audience to celebrate with him. The tournament was broadcast on BBC2, with 10.8 million viewers on the second day of the final.\nHiggins had two ranking points deducted for misconduct in February 1981, which meant that he was second behind Reardon rather than first in the snooker world rankings 1982/1983 after his championship win. Before the tournament, Reardon was ranked fourth and Higgins was eleventh. Thorburn and Steve Davis dropped from first and second to third and fourth respectively. Griffiths, who had been third, dropped to 14th. The day after his 1982 Championship win, he attended a WPBSA disciplinary meeting, which considered incidents including Higgins urinating in a flower display at the Crucible during the event, and an incident at the 1982 Irish Masters where he had told audience members to \"shut your traps\". The Association fined him £1,000 for bringing the game into disrepute.\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for each round. The numbers in brackets are player seeds, whilst those in bold denote match winners.\nQualifying.\nQualifying matches took place in April 1982 at Redwood Lodge Country Club, Bristol; Romiley Forum, Stockport; Astra La Reserve Club, Sutton Coldfield; and Sheffield Snooker Centre. Qualifying matches were played over two rounds as the best-of-17 frames. The results are shown below. Players in bold denote match winners. Former world champion John Pulman withdrew from the competition because he had not sufficiently recovered after sustaining a broken leg in October 1981.\nCentury breaks.\nThere were 10 century breaks at the championship, the highest being 143 by Willie Thorne. On offer was a £5,000 bonus for compiling a break higher than the championship record of 145.\nThree century breaks were made in the qualifying competition."

        "title": "London New Zealand Cricket Club",
        "text": "The London New Zealand Cricket Club is a cricket club in London, England, founded in December 1951 at New Zealand's High Commission to the United Kingdom and plays teams in the United Kingdom and Europe.\nVarious players of the New Zealand national cricket team (and other international cricket teams), the All Blacks, and first-class players have appeared for the club over the years, although players of all abilities are welcome provided they are from New Zealand or have a deep connection thereto.\nLNZCC raises its own teams and plays non-competition games at the grounds of the opposition. Many of the teams are competitive club teams or established friendly teams and many of the grounds are notable for their location and quality, for example, the early season fixture against Wimbledon who play in the Surrey Championship and who play at the Wimbledon Cricket Club Ground, located opposite the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club; the match vs the Honourable Artillery Company who play at the Artillery Ground in Finsbury in the City of London; against The Hurlingham Club, an exclusive sports and social club located in Fulham, London, England. Other notable fixtures are played at Ripley in Surrey, vs Goodwood on The Duke of Richmond and Gordon's estate overlooking Goodwood House near Chichester and against Hagley CC at Hagley Hall, the seat of the Lyttelton family and home of current Lord Chris and Lady Tessa Cobham. The club has also played against touring New Zealand cricket team sides and the Marylebone Cricket Club.\nHistory and role.\nThe genesis of LNZCC was New Zealander Trevor Campbell shortly after World War II, in his role as the ‘Public Relations Officer’ of the NZ High Commission. Campbell posited that the UK was very grateful to New Zealand for its assistance of Great Britain in World War II and such signs of gratitude could be extended through cricket, a game widely popular in both countries, and that games could be played against teams who would no doubt feature returned servicemen who fought with New Zealanders during World War II.\nCampbell was based at the New Zealand High Commission in the former ‘Dominion of New Zealand’ building, 415 The Strand, London and sought the help of Errol Holmes former England test cricketer, MCC captain to New Zealand in 1935/36 and then-current MCC committee member, in establishing a club. With the added support of NZ High Commissioner Sir Frederick Doidge and the MCC, Campbell invited more than 200 well-known New Zealanders living in the UK to meet.\nLNZCC was formed at the New Zealand High Commission in December 1951 during severe smog conditions. It was decided that the aim of LNZCC (which continues to this day, as well as meeting at the New Zealand High Commission building for a mid-season function) was to \"provide the opportunity for its members to play and enjoy cricket in the home of the game and to meet socially\".\nMore than 70 people attended the meeting that formed LNZCC including many illustrious sporting and military names. In attendance – Sir Arthur Simms; Sir Arthur Donnelly; Harold Gilligan (Captain of the England team that played New Zealand's first ever test;) LEL Donne; Walter Hadlee; Roger Blunt; Alan Mitchell amongst others. At the meeting, Roger Blunt, a former New Zealand cricket team captain, was made the first Club Captain and Errol Holmes the first President, Campbell Honorary Secretary and invitations to stand as Vice-President were sent to then New Zealand Prime Minister Sir Sidney Holland and to High Commissioner Sir Frederick Doidge. The first two men elected VP were Lord Newall (Cyril Newall, ex Governor-General of NZ and Marshall of the Royal Air Force during WW2) and Lord Freyberg VC (as General Bernard Freyberg, Commander of the NZ Expeditionary Force in WW2; earlier in his career he was awarded the Victoria Cross in the Battle of the Somme in 1916; later he was Governor- General of NZ.)\nAmongst the active members of LNZCC were New Zealand test cricketers Tom Pritchard, Don Taylor, Roger Blunt, Bill Merritt and John Reid; Jim Laker, Ray Hitchcock (327 first-class games and 12,500 runs) and former All Black captain Ron Elvidge. \nA fixture list was soon created and the following year LNZCC was listed in the MCC's 'Register of Clubs' at Lord's Cricket Ground.\nThe Club Captain role has long since ceased but the President role continues with a change to 'Chairman' and together with a committee, LNZCC continues to attract cricket-playing New Zealanders and a small number of friends from the Commonwealth.\nIn 2002, LNZCC observed its 50th anniversary when Paddy Gaffikin, an LNZCC newcomer in the 1966 season when New Zealanders arrived in the United Kingdom on ocean liners rather than long-haul aeroplanes, authored a history of the club entitled 'Kiwis on the Common'. The Golden Jubilee season, and Diamond Jubilee season in 2012, were both celebrated at The Oval, home ground of the Surrey cricket team (who LNZCC has also played).\nLNZCC continues to this day through the help of volunteers who provide a cricketing base and network for UK-based New Zealanders, be they young 'backpackers' on their 'OE', sportsmen playing in the UK, or established business people. Current and past membership of LNZCC is wide and illustrious. LNZCC also has branches in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, New Zealand and games are played in LNZCC colours by members in New Zealand.\nInteresting facts.\nOne of the most striking elements of LNZCC is the visually-appealing striped blazers worn by members to games and social events. The blazers are made up of vertical stripes in the colours of the club - representing The City of London (red), the Silver Fern which is a sporting symbol of New Zealand (silver) and the blue symbolises the waters of the Pacific Ocean (Pacific blue). Blazing bright in colour and mass, they are often captured by the media at test matches, Lord's Cricket Ground, The Oval and have been spotted at All Black test matches amongst others. They've featured in news articles too.\nRipley Cricket Club is the only fixture to have been played uninterrupted since the first season in 1952.\nSince 2008 all LNZCC players are capped with ‘Nottman Caps’ once they have played five games. The Nottman Cap is named after Harold Nottman who was one of LNZCC's longest-serving playing members (from the 1950s to the 1990s no less) and a notable administrator in the club's history. One of his finest days on the cricket field for LNZCC was against Ripley Cricket Club when he took nine wickets in a match.\nOverseas tours have included Porto in Portugal, matches vs teams in Denmark in the 1960s and a special match vs the Monte Carlo Cricket Club in Bouyon in the Alpes-Maritime near Nice. Since 2013, LNZCC has toured the Mediterranean for matches in Ibiza, Spain against the island's cricket team.\nNaturally, members of the club are supporters of the New Zealand cricket team and have often made the news when traveling around the world for that purpose.\nNotable players.\nList principally sourced from 'Kiwis on the Common'\nNew Zealand national cricket team\nAll Blacks\nWest Indies national cricket team\nSouth African cricket team\nEnglish cricket team\nNew Zealand Football Team\nOther"

Hosted by University of the East, the UE Warriors defeated the MCU Tigers in a single game finals taking their second straight UAAP men's basketball championship since joining the league in 1952. This was the only finals appearance of Manila Central University before pulling out of the league in 1962. MCU was the only former UAAP member school that reached the basketball tournament finals.\nFinals.\nOlympian Constancio Ortiz sizzled all night long with his outside shots as he bannered defending champion University of the East to its second straight UAAP crown by blasting Manila Central University, 102-88, before a sparse crowd of 4,000 at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum.\nOrtiz, the Warriors’ top rifleman, mocked all guards thrown at him by the Tigers, as he scored a league record of 51 points which eclipsed the 46 registered by University of Manila’s Vicente Casado five years earlier. Also overshadowed by Ortiz’s impeccable outside shooting was the 43-point output of National University’s Narciso Bernardo, the best individual scoring record the previous year.\nWith Ortiz running rings around MCU’s Damian Lim, Henry Hill and Juan Rivera, the Warriors took a 16-8 advantage but the Tigers rallied mightily through the heads-up plays of Manuel Abella, Ernesto Gonzalo Jr., Eduardo Zamora and Rivera to deadlock the game at 16-16. Both teams battled evenly as the Tigers gallantly frustrated the Warriors’ breakaway bid until the sweet shooting Ortiz resumed his net ripping chores that gave the Azcarraga-based dribblers a 50-42 halftime advantage. The Warriors managed to post a 53-44 lead early in the final half but again MCU struck back, chopping the advantage to just five, 52-57. Undaunted, the Warriors, with Ortiz getting able support from Roehl Nadurata, Mario Uson and Agapito de Castro, widened UE’s advantage to 12, 82-70, en route to an unassailable 100-82 advantage, two minutes left.

At the end of the regular season the Frankfurter Löwen contested the first-ever German Bowl against the Ansbach Grizzlies and won 14–8.\nModus.\nDuring the regular season each club played all other clubs home and away. The best two teams after the regular season then contested the German Bowl.\nSeason overview.\nThe formation of the league dates back to a German TV interview with Alexander Sperber, son of a U.S. Army soldier and German mother, which created enough interest to form a number of teams and the league in March 1979.\nThe league's opening game was held on 4 August 1979 in Düsseldorf when the Düsseldorf Panther hosted the Frankfurter Löwen in front of 4,400 spectators and lost 0–38.\nThe regular season saw the Frankfurter Löwen win all their nine-season games, the tenth game, the home game against the Berlin Bären having been cancelled. Behind Frankfurt the Ansbach Grizzlies finished runners-up, undefeated by the other four teams but unable to overcome the Löwen . At the end of the table the Düsseldorf Panther remained winless all season. In the inaugural German Bowl, held in Frankfurt on 10 November 1979, the Löwen defeated Ansbach once more to take out the first-ever German championship.\nLeague table.\nThe league table of the American football Bundesliga:\nAftermath.\nThe 1979 season remained the only season of the American football Bundesliga, renamed to German Football League in 1999, to be played in single-division format. From 1980 onwards the league was subdivided into regional divisions, predominantly north and south.\nThe Frankfurter Löwen continued their dominance in 1980, winning another title but then declined and folded in 1985. The Ansbach Grizzlies went on to play in each of the first eight German Bowls, winning the 1981, 1982 and 1985 editions. The club declined from there, dropped out of the league in 1990 and never returned to the highest level of play. The Bremerhaven Seahawks and Düsseldorf Panther briefly left the league after the 1979 season to join a rival competition but returned soon after. The Seahawks dropped out of the league in 1986 and, like Ansbach, never returned. The Panther, alongside the Berlin Bären, soon renamed to Berlin Adler, and the Munich Cowboys became more permanent features of the league, dropping out of the league on occasions but still spending more seasons in the league than any other club and winning thirteen German Bowls between them."

He scored 15 points on the decisive match.\nAfter participating with the NBA D-League Select Team at the 2012 NBA Summer League, the BayHawks traded his rights to the Santa Cruz Warriors for a 2012 D-League draft pick. After averaging 7 points and 5.7 rebounds with the Warriors, Daniels signed with Chinese team Qingdao DoubleStar on December 12. On March 8, 2013, Santa Cruz traded his rights to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers for Scott Machado. He signed with Rio Grande Valley afterwards.\nAfter joining the Indiana Pacers for the 2013 NBA Summer League, and a small stint with Applied Science University of the Jordanian league, Daniels signed with the Liaoning Flying Leopards of China. After averaging 16.6 points and 8.3 rebounds he moved to Lebanon, now with Sagesse on January 18, 2014.\nDespite the bad experience with the Leopards, Daniels came back to China after signing with the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the 2013–14 season. During his stint with the Tigers, he played in 33 games averaging 12.6 points and 7.7 rebounds, shooting 67.5% from two and 41.7% from three during the season.\nOn September 23, 2015, Daniels signed with the Brooklyn Nets. However, he was later waived by the Nets on October 20 after appearing in five preseason games. On December 25, he signed with Al-Riyadi Beirut, returning to Lebanon for a second stint.\nOn April 15, 2021, Daniels signed with Nigerian side Rivers Hoopers of the Basketball Africa League (BAL).\nOn November 16, 2021, he joined Argentino de Junín of the Liga Nacional de Básquet (LNB), returning to Argentina after 5 years. He averaged 10.7 points and 7.5 rebounds in 21.8 minutes per game in the LNB.\nAfter starting the 2022–23 season with Ezzahra Sports in the Tunisian Championnat National A, Daniels joined Syrian club Nawair in December.\nLegal battle against Liaoning.\nOn September 1, 2013, after 8 games of a guaranteed contract, the Liaoning Flying Leopards released Daniels and refused to pay him the rest of his contract. After that, Daniels took legal action and sued the Chinese team for the payment refusal and several abuses, among them, putting Daniels' family in an isolated apartment without any heat. After analysing the situation, FIBA decided to take action and ordered Liaoning to pay Daniels his remaining unpaid salary plus lawyer fees, totalling $300 thousand, however, the Chinese team refused to recognise the judgement and planned to appeal (despite no means available to it). After the refusal, FIBA added a 130,000 dollars fine to the Chinese team."

        "title": "St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers women's basketball",
        "text": "The St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers women's basketball program represented St. Francis College (SFC) in intercollegiate women's basketball. The team was a member of the Division I Northeast Conference from 1988 until 2023. The Terriers played at the Activity Resource Center at Pratt Institute (aka \"The ARC\") in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Through the start of the 2022–23 season, the team had played at the Peter Aquilone Court at the Generoso Pope Athletic Complex on SFC's former campus in Brooklyn Heights. At the end of the 2021–22 school year, SFC moved to a new campus on Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn that has no athletic facilities; SFC arranged to use The ARC on at least a temporary basis. On March 20, 2023, St. Francis Brooklyn announced the discontinuation of all intercollegiate sports, meaning the 2022–23 season was the final season for the Terriers.\nHistory.\nThe women's team kicked off intercollegiate athletics at St. Francis College in 1973. The first head coach was Christine McGowan, who led them to a 9–5 record. Since the 1988–89 season the women's basketball team has been a part of the Northeast Conference. The programs first Conference tournament Championship and NCAA Tournament participation occurred in 2015 when both were accomplished.\nJohn Thurston era.\nFrom 2012 until 2018, John Thurston was the head coach of the St. Francis College Terriers. After the 2017–18 season Thurston retired. While at the helm of the Terriers, Thurston accumulated a 73–110 record, the highest win total of any coach in program history. Thurston also was the first coach in program history to win a Northeast Conference tournament Championship and participate in an NCAA tournament. Also under Thurston, the 2013–14 squad set the single-season program record with 19 victories.\nIn 2012, Thurston replaced Brenda Milano, who coached the Terriers for 9 seasons leading them to the NEC playoffs only 3 times. After not making the NEC Tournament for four consecutive seasons, from 2008 to 2011, first-year head coach Thurston was able to secure the 7th seed in 2012. The Terriers also won more than 10 games for the first time in 5 years that season and had an overall record of 11–19.\nFor the 2013–14 season the Terriers made a pair of appearances on ESPN3 for the first time in their history. The 2013–14 Terriers improved to 6–2 on the season for the first time since the 1976–77 season. After going 11–2 by winning 5 straight games, the Terriers for the first time in program history were ranked inside the top 25 of a national basketball poll at 25th in the CollegeInsider.com Top 25 Mid-Major Poll. The 2013–14 squad set the single-season school record with 19 wins during the year. The Terriers also notched 10 conference wins, which was the most in St. Francis Brooklyn women's basketball history to that point.\nThe 2014–15 team was invited to participate in the 2014 Preseason WNIT, the first in the program's history. They also won the 2014–15 Northeast Conference Women's Basketball Championship after defeating Robert Morris on the road. St. Francis Brooklyn is the first team in the conference to go on the road and win all three tournament games to be crowned Northeast Conference Champions. They are also the first number 5 seed to take home the championship trophy. This was the first championship for St. Francis women's basketball in program history. The women's basketball team also made its first NCAA tournament appearance and lost to eventual champions Connecticut.\nDuring the 2015–16 season the Terriers excelled in the classroom and posted the number one ranking in the NCAA for team GPA. Additionally, the Terriers for four consecutive years have won Northeast Conference Top Academic Team Awards, four consecutive Northeast Conference Sportsmanship Awards, and four consecutive years finishing among the top five teams in the Women's Basketball Coaches Association Team GPA rankings.\nLinda Cimino era.\nCimino was formally announced as the head coach of the Terriers on May 21, 2018. She became the 13th head coach in program history. Previously, Cimino was the head coach at Binghamton. In Cimino's first year at the helm, she set the Terrier record for conference wins in a season, 12, which was previously held by John Thurston's 2013–14 squad that won 10.\nAt the conclusion of the 2022–23 season, St. Francis Brooklyn announced the discontinuation of all intercollegiate sports effective at the end of the Spring Semester 2023. This makes the 2022–23 Terriers team the last team to represent St. Francis Brooklyn in women's basketball at the Division One level.\nTournament results.\nNCAA.\nThe Terriers appeared in their first NCAA Tournament in 2015, a 33–89 loss to first seed and eventual champions Connecticut in the Albany Regional at Storrs, Connecticut.\nRivalry.\nThe fiercest rival of the Terriers were the LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds (now LIU Sharks). They have competed annually since their first match on February 21, 1975. During the 1993–94 season the women's basketball programs of St. Francis College and Long Island University contested their first official Battle of Brooklyn match. As of the 2019–20 season, the Terriers lead the series 14–13.\nTerrier records.\nIn the 2018-19 season, Amy O'Neill became the first Terrier to record a triple-double. She did so twice during the season, first at Sacred Heart (2/2/19) and again at home against LIU Brooklyn (2/16/19). O'Neill also led the country by averaging 8.6 assists per game.\nRetired numbers.\nThe St. Francis Brooklyn women's basketball program retired their first two numbers in 2018. The ceremony's coincided with the 50th anniversary of St. Francis College being a coeducational institution. Zatorski's number 15 was retired on December 15, 2018, during halftime of a Terriers game. Zatorski broke various Terrier records while she was playing and still holds the record for most field goals in a season with 209 in 1977–78. Erving-Schiera's number 40 was retired on February 9, 2019. Erving-Schiera is the programs leading scorer and rebounder."

        "text": "The Professional Rugby Organization, known as PRO Rugby, was an American professional rugby union competition. PRO began play in April 2016 with five teams and ceased operations by January 2017. The competition was sanctioned by USA Rugby and by World Rugby. This was the first professional rugby competition in North America.\nHistory.\nPrevious attempts.\nFor several years prior to PRO Rugby's launch in 2016, a number of entities had explored a professional competition for fifteen-a-side rugby. The Rugby Super League, a national competition that began play in 1997, was discussed as potentially becoming a professional competition, but the RSL struggled financially, with several teams exiting the competition from 2009 to 2012 before the league folded after the 2012 season.\nIn 2012, the American Professional Rugby Competition was reported to be exploring a launch of a ten-team league for 2015, but nothing came of it.\nThe National Rugby Football League also announced its intention to begin a professional rugby competition and scheduled the Independence Cup, but the venture never got off the ground.\nPRO Rugby launch.\nIn early November 2015, PRO Rugby launched its Facebook page and scheduled an announcement for November 9, 2015. On November 9, 2015, PRO Rugby made an official announcement outlining its plans and a framework for the competition. USA Rugby affirmed that it sanctioned and supported the PRO Rugby competition. PRO Rugby announced its first team, Sacramento, on November 18, 2015. PRO Rugby announced its second team, San Francisco, on November 19, 2015.\nThough teams were scheduled to have coaches by the end of 2015, the uncertainty caused by the open position for head coach of the U.S. national rugby team led to PRO Rugby announcements being put on hold. As of mid-January 2016, with the U.S. head coach in place but no further developments from Pro Rugby, the league then offered the explanation that negotiating venues was what was holding up coach and player announcements but that three venues were close to agreement. On January 22, 2016, PRO Rugby announced San Diego as the league's third team, and media sources started speculating that the league may have only five teams in 2016 instead of the planned six teams. PRO Rugby announced on February 9, 2016 that the league's fourth team would be based in Columbus, Ohio. PRO Rugby officially announced on February 26, 2016 that Denver would be the competition's fifth team.\n2016 inaugural season.\nThe league had planned to hold a player draft in early 2016, and the league reportedly had begun extending contract offers to select players by mid-February. In early March, the league made its first official announcement regarding player signings when it announced that Italian international Mirco Bergamasco would be joining the Sacramento team. Teams started convening their players in mid-March 2016 to begin training.\nThe competition began play on April 17, 2016. The first weekend of PRO Rugby saw Denver win at home against Ohio 16–13 before 2,300 fans despite a snowstorm, and Sacramento defeated San Francisco 37–25 before a crowd of 3,400 in Sacramento. The inaugural PRO Rugby Championship was decided in the last game of the season on July 31, 2016, with the Denver Stampede clinching the title by gaining a bonus point despite losing away to the Ohio Aviators 32–25.\n2016–17 off-season and folding.\nDuring the offseason, Director of Rugby Steve Lewis left PRO Rugby, with no replacement named. It was later reported that Lewis claimed PRO Rugby and Schoninger owed him unpaid salary and expenses; Lewis filed a claim in court, went to the New York state labor board, and also filed a grievance with USA Rugby.\nThe league had announced its intention to expand in 2017. Expansion was expected to include teams in the northeast United States. PRO Rugby stated that the 2017 competition format planned to include eight teams split into a west coast conference and a midwest/east conference. Expansion had been anticipated to include Canada in 2017, with PRO Rugby close to agreeing to place teams in Toronto and Vancouver. Rugby Canada announced on November 2, 2016, that an agreement with PRO for sanctioning in Canada for 2017 could not be reached, with the primary reason being their disagreement with an exclusivity clause that would have prevented Rugby Canada from sanctioning other professional rugby clubs in Canada in the future. In turn, PRO Rugby announced that it would no longer contract Canadian players.\nThe league folded the San Francisco Rush in December 2016. Schoninger blamed the folding on the lack of a suitable venue, and on lack of support from the local media. All PRO Rugby players then received notice on December 20, 2016, that their contracts would be terminated in 30 days if progress was not made towards resolving disputes between the league and USA Rugby. As of 2018, numerous players still report not to have been paid the salaries specified in their contracts with PRO Rugby. To recover some of their lost income, some players filed claims with their local labor commissioner offices. No other official announcements were made.\nBy the end of 2017, neither Schoninger or any representative for PRO Rugby had shown up in any of the court cases in regards to the expenses owed to former director Lewis and others from the operation on the lone Pro Rugby season.\nCompetition format.\nEach team played 12 regular-season games over 16 weeks: six home matches and six away. Teams were awarded 4 points for a win, and 2 points for a draw. Teams were also awarded 1 point if they lost by 7 points or fewer, as well as for scoring 4 or more tries in a match. There was no post-season with the Championship decided on league table points.\nThe season ran from April to July with the teams having a lighter schedule during the June international test window, a time when teams lost players to the U.S. national team.\nTeams.\nThe league began play in 2016 with five U.S. based teams.\nThe competition operated in a single-entity structure with all teams, at least initially, owned by the league, itself; individual investors own an interest in the competition but did not own individual teams.\nPlayers.\nEach team had a roster limit of 30 players, five of whom could have been foreign players. All player contracts were held by the league, not by the individual teams. Players earned salaries, on average, of around $25,000, with national team players making closer to $40,000. The top players in the competition earned up to $70,000.\nThe following foreign PRO Rugby players have earned caps for a Tier One nation:\nPRO Rugby also signed several US-capped internationals who had been playing professionally overseas:\nBroadcast.\nMatches were available to stream through prorugby.org or on cable through ONE World Sports. Initially, selected matches were available free to all online through AOL.com, but this came to an abrupt and unexplained end. Through the league's official website, all matches were streamed free to all viewers. ONE World Sports was offered by multiple cable and satellite providers and covered a range of sports, most notably a large selection of soccer, prior to its liquidation.\nThe league signed a deal with Time Warner Cable to provide streaming of games from Ohio on April 28, 2016."

        "text": "Enemy or NME was an American esports organization with teams competing in \"League of Legends\", \"Call of Duty\", \"Smite\", and \"Super Smash Bros.\" They were originally branded as Enemy eSports. Enemy's \"League of Legends\" team competed in the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS), but was relegated to the League of Legends Challenger Series after their first split in the LCS. The organization ended all operations in 2017.\n\"League of Legends\".\nEnemy eSports was founded in 2012 by Dan \"Clerkie\" Clerke, Robert \"Chachi\" Stemmler, and James \"JR3\" Ryan. In May Enemy eSports announced that they had rejected a $1.2 million offer from Martin Shkreli.\n2014 season.\nEnemy acquired the roster of Also Known As (AKA) in spring of 2014 to represent them in the NACS. The roster consisted of Potato Zero, Stan007, Jayel, SleepingDAWG, and Papa Chau. Leara (manager) and theangelvigil (analyst) joined as support staff. The team was unable to qualify for the NACS.\n2015 Preseason.\nOn September 30, Enemy eSports announced their new roster for the Spring Expansion tournament. cackgod, Liquid Inori|Inori, Wolfsclaw, Otter, and Bodydrop competed under the name \"The Cackson 5\" in the ranked 5s ladder to qualify for the tournament. At the time of the ladder lock, they were ranked second behind Team Coast's team.\nEnemy eSports placed second in the 2014 Fall NA Black Monster Cup, beating Boreal eSports and Zenith eSports before falling to Team LoLPro in the finals.\nOn November 17, after winning their first-round match against Noble Truth in the Expansion Tournament 2–0, Enemy announced a partnership with Azubu. The team then lost 0–2 to Team Fusion in the second round, against MakNooN's Poppy both games.\nAfter elimination from the Expansion Tournament, Enemy eSports underwent roster tryouts. The roster listed for the NACL New Year's Kick-off Tournament included Flaresz, Cackgod, Innox, Otter, and Bodydrop, with LOD and Wolfe as substitutes.\nDuring late December, Enemy management decided on a Challenger Series roster of Flaresz top, Innox mid, Otter and Bodydrop in the bottom lane, and former H2K jungler and European Challenger Series winner Trashy. In early January 2015, the team moved into a gaming house in Corona, California. Due to Bodydrop's flight being delayed, the team needed to use a substitute support player in the ESL Pro Series Season XI, and took an upset loss against Monster Kittens.\n2015 season.\nA couple weeks later, Enemy played in the 2015 North American Challenger Series qualifiers as the #1 seed from the Ranked 5's ladder and qualified for the 2015 Challenger Series with 2-0 victories over Arbiters and Darkness.\nEnemy finished the Challenger season as the top team with a 9–1 record, dropping only one game to Team Fusion. In the 2015 playoffs, they defeated Final Five and then Team Dragon Knights and successfully qualified for the Summer LCS split. After the team's LCS qualification, CEO Dan \"clerkie\" Clerke received an offer for $1.2 million from Martin Shkreli; however, he declined it, stating the members of the organization \"...believe in this roster. These players have risked so much in the hunt for their dream, we want to take this journey with them.\" Prior to the start of the summer split, Enemy dropped the \"eSports\" from their name and rebranded themselves as just \"Enemy\".\nEnemy's summer split performance was rocky, and they didn't finish higher than seventh place a single week after the second. They ended the split in ninth place, one game above Team Dragon Knights, narrowly avoiding autorelegation. However, in the 2016 Spring Promotion tournament, Enemy lost 3–0 to Team Coast and were sent to the 2016 Challenger Series. On August 6, 2015, it was announced that Youngbuck would become the team's new head coach.\n\"Smite\".\nEnemy had a Smite team for Smite Pro League Season 2, but the team members later left when the team was relegated. In August, Enemy acquired the roster of Legion of Carrots and returned to the SPL.\nThe new NME team, consisting of Benjamin \"wigglesdabae\" Lyubarskiy, Chris \"Tri0\" McGee, Declan \"Quatr0\" McJohnson, Alexander \"Khaos\" Greenstein, and captain Louis-Phillipe \"PainDeViande\" Geoffrion, would place 5th in the SPL Fall Split 2015, but would still qualify for LAN under the new Super Regional format, although wigglesdabae left midway through the split, replaced by Jared \"Adjust\" Deline. They would upset Team SoloMid (3–1) and Team EnVyUs (3–2) to secure second place in the NA Smite Super Regionals 2015, losing to Cloud9 G2A, but qualifying for the SWC.\nThe same team would go on to upset FNATIC and Paradigm to move onto the finals of the SWC, falling to Epsilon eSports. The team placed 2nd at the 2016 Smite World Championship.\nFollowing their success, Adjust was dropped, and Suharab \"Masked\" Askarzada replaced him. Only a couple weeks later, Masked, Vetium, and saltmachine (then known as Benj1) would leave Enemy for Denial eSports, and captain PainDeViande brought on three rookies, Maksim \"PandaCat\" Yanevich (who he had previously played with on Legion of Carrots), Lucas \"Varizial\" Spracklin, and Travis \"Marauder\" Navarro, for the SPL Spring Split of Season 3. Defying all odds, the team would go on to upset the entire league, taking first place and qualifying for Dreamhack Masters 2016.\nAt Dreamhack, they would defeat Kaos Latin Gamers before losing to Soar G2A in the semi-finals.\nIn the off-season, they would participate in the Epsilon Invitational, drawing with Paradigm in the group stage, before winning a tiebreaker and facing a rematch with Panthera (formerly Epsilon, now NRG). They would take 2 games off of the world champions, but lose in the end. Lucas \"Varizial\" Spracklin would change his name to \"Shatt3red\" going into the event.\nIn the Fall Split of Season 3, PandaCat was forced to go to Ukraine for vacation as a family tradition, so Jonathan \"Fearno\" King substituted for him in the online events. PandaCat returned to North America in the final week of online events, however, unlike previous splits, Enemy was not a top team, placing seventh of eight in online events. After Enemy disbanded, the team left for CEO Dan \"clerkie\" Clerke's new organization ."

        "title": "San Lorenzo de Almagro (basketball)",
        "text": "Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro is the men's professional club basketball section of the homonymous sports club based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The team plays in the Liga Nacional de Básquet (LNB), which is the first tier level division of the Argentine basketball league system, and Pan-America's premier men's basketball league, the Basketball Champions League Americas. Their home arena is the Estadio Ciudad de Santiago del Estero. The team is currently coached by Silvio Santander. \nIn the period 1942-1973, he stood out for what he did at the amateur and semi-amateur level, in which he won 29 regional titles, won the Argentine Club Championship, and was South American runner-up in 1958. In addition, he was one of the founding clubs of the National League, playing the opening game of said tournament on April 26, 1985. Although the club is known mainly for its soccer part, it is also one of the most important basketball clubs in the country and South America, being a multi-champion at various times in its history. He has to his credit five Leagues (2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2020-21), two Liga de las Américas, and other titles such as a Super 4, and two Super Cups. San Lorenzo is the first, and so far, the only Argentine basketball team to face an NBA team. It is the only club that has been four-time and five-time champion of the National League.\nHistory.\nBeginning and golden years.\nSan Lorenzo affiliated to the Argentine Association in the 1930s decade, and won a large number of championships from the 1930s to the 1970s, being nicknamed \"The Cathedral of Basketball\". 1942 was the year when San Lorenzo achieved its first titles, winning the Torneo Apertura (Opening Tournament) and the Official championship, organised by the Buenos Aires Basketball Association. One year later, the team won another Apertura title, and they then won the 1946, 1949, and 1950 Apertura official titles. The club's most notable players of that era were Alfredo Belli, Salvador Capece, and Alberto Trama. Other notable members of the team were Armando Bo and Francisco Sommariva.\nIn 1951, San Lorenzo played against The Harlem Globetrotters, at the Estadio Luna Park, in Buenos Aires. That same year, the team won the Apertura championship (and repeated again in 1952), and the Official in 1954. Two years later, the team won another Official title, remaining unbeaten, and its first Torneo Metropolitano (Metropolitan Tournament) title. In 1957, San Lorenzo made its first international tour of Brazil, where the squad won 8 of 12 games played. Players on the tour were: Ricardo Lanzillotta (team captain), Herberto Fagnani, Edgar Parizzia, Oscar Zagatti, Carlos Vasino, Vicente Lazzara, Erio Cassetai, and Carlos Marranzino, with Francisco del Río being the head coach of the team.\nSan Lorenzo won its first national title in 1958, the Campeonato Argentino (Argentine Championship of Clubs). That allowed the team to play its first official tournament outside of Argentina, as the club competed in the South American top-tier level South American Championship of Champions Clubs, where San Lorenzo finished second, behind Defensor Sporting. At the Argentine national domestic level, San Lorenzo won the 1958 Apertura title, and finished third in the Buenos Aires championship (although the squad won the 1959 and 1960 titles). In 1966, San Lorenzo won the Apertura title finishing unbeaten, and both the Metropolitano and Buenos Aires championships, in 1968.\nThe 1970s began with the 1970 Metropolitano championship, and the club then winning two titles else in 1971. That same year, San Lorenzo toured in Europe, marking the first time that an Argentine team played there. The club's layers were Oscar Visciglia, Gustavo Aguirre, Carlos Perroni, Carlos Garro, Dante Massolini, Norberto Pacheco, Carlos Perales, Abel Rojas, Néstor Delgui, and Emilio Dumani, with Edgard Parizzia acting as the team's head coach. San Lorenzo defeated OKK Beograd, Yugoslavian national league club, and six rivals from Italy. They also played against the Spain national team. During that tour, the team was nicknamed, \"La Catedral\" (The cathedral), after a speech from team player Emilio Dumani, saying: \"This is a team that always fights, and never turns off... like the lights of a Cathedral\".\nDespite those successful years, the 1973 Buenos Aires championship was their last title until the 2010s.\nLiga Nacional and decline.\nOn April 26, 1985, San Lorenzo played the opening game of the recently created Liga Nacional de Básquet (LNB) (National Basketball League), facing Argentino de Firmat at the Obras Sanitarias venue. Nevertheless, the team was relegated that same year.\nThe basketball section of the club was inactive between 1986 and 1993, returning only at youth levels. In 1996, San Lorenzo's senior squad returned to first division tournaments of the city of Buenos Aires. The club also won the Under-22 championship (2004), and the 2012 Copa De Oyarbide (Oyarbide Cup).\nReturn to glory.\nIn 2014, San Lorenzo debuted in the Torneo Nacional de Ascenso (TNA) (National Promotion Tournament), the second tier level division of professional basketball in Argentina. In 2015, San Lorenzo acquired a vacant place in the Argentine top-tier level Liga Nacional de Básquet (LNB) (National Basketball League), because of a merger with the club 9 de Julio de Río Tercero. 30 years after its debut in the LNB, San Lorenzo returned to the top division on September 22, 2015, and beat Quimsa, by a score of 79–64.\nSan Lorenzo won its first LNB title in 2016, after beating La Unión, with a 4–0 series sweep in the league's finals. San Lorenzo player, Walter Herrmann, was chosen as MVP of the Finals.\nIn the following season, San Lorenzo won its 2nd consecutive Argentine League title, after defeating Regatas Corrientes, 4–1 at the finals. The team became the most winning team in the LNB's history, with a 23–3 record. Gabriel Deck was chosen as the Final's MVP. Unlike the 2015–16 series, San Lorenzo played its home games at Roberto Pando arena, in Boedo, Buenos Aires.\nArena.\nSan Lorenzo plays its home games at the Polideportivo Roberto Pando, which is located in Boedo, Buenos Aires.

Like all other divisions, WCL Division Seven was contested as a standalone tournament rather than as an actual league.\nThe inaugural Division Seven tournament was held in 2009, hosted by Guernsey and won by Bahrain. The 2011 and 2013 tournaments were both held in Botswana, and won by Kuwait and Nigeria, respectively. Because the WCL operates on a system of promotion and relegation, teams generally only participated in one or two Division Seven tournaments before being either promoted to Division Six or relegated, either to Division Eight or to regional competitions. Overall, 13 teams played in at least one Division Seven tournament, with Nigeria the only team to feature in all three tournaments."

In the game, the Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34–28 in overtime.\nOn February 6, 2018, it was reported that Judge was leaving the Patriots to join the Indianapolis Colts' new head coach Josh McDaniels in Indianapolis; when McDaniels spurned the Colts and chose to stay with the Patriots, Judge made the same decision. After wide receivers coach Chad O'Shea left New England to become offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins, Judge was tapped to fill O'Shea's role while continuing to serve as special teams coordinator; according to ESPN, he was the only coach in the NFL with both special teams and wide receiver duties. Judge won his third Super Bowl title when the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII.\nNew York Giants.\nOn January 8, 2020, Judge was hired to become the 21st head coach of the New York Giants. According to \"Sports Illustrated\"'s Rick Gosselin, he is only the second NFL head coach to have been hired directly from a special teams coaching job, after Frank Gansz.\n2020 season.\nOn September 13, 2020, Judge lost his head coaching debut against the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 26–16. After an 0–5 start to the season, Judge received his first career win as a head coach in a 20–19 win against the Washington Football Team on October 18, 2020. On November 18, 2020, there was a coaching controversy when Judge fired his offensive line coach Marc Colombo and replaced him with former Dolphins offensive line coach Dave DeGuglielmo after Week 10, due to a verbal altercation. In his first season as the head coach of the Giants, Judge led them to a 6–10 record, finishing second in the NFC East.\n2021 season.\nThe Giants regressed during Judge's second season, going 4–13 and finishing last in the NFC East. Judge recorded the most losses by a Giants head coach with 13 surpassing the mark of 12 by Jim Fassel in 2003. Judge was fired on January 11, 2022, finishing his tenure in New York with an overall record of 10–23 (.303). Judge's season suffered from questionable calls, such as a coach's challenge on a non-reviewable scoring play during Week 1 versus the Denver Broncos, a controversial 11 minute post-game locker room rant after a loss to the Chicago Bears, and a quarterback sneak on 3rd and 9 against their own goalline during a Week 18 matchup against the Washington Football Team.\nNew England Patriots (second stint).\nOn February 8, 2022, the Patriots announced that Judge was hired as an offensive assistant. On July 21, 2022, the Patriots announced that he will also be the Quarterbacks coach. He lost his quarterback's coach job following the hire of Bill O'Brien on January 26, 2023, and was named assistant head coach in 2023.\nOle Miss Rebels.\nOn April 3, 2024, it was reported that Judge had joined the Ole Miss Rebels as a senior analyst.\nPersonal life.\nJudge's father, Joseph, played football at Temple and professionally with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League. Judge's wife, Amber, was an All-SEC soccer player at Mississippi State, and they have four children together. Judge's son, Sean, played high school football at Bishop Feehan High School and is a Clemson University football commit."

        "text": "The 2016 end-of-year rugby union internationals, also known as the \"2016 Autumn Internationals\" in the Northern Hemisphere, were a series of international rugby union matches predominantly played between the visiting Southern Hemisphere countries: Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa – and the European sides: England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales.\nThe 2016 November international window saw 37 international matches take place, with an additional seven international matches taking place outside the allocated three week window. 27 nations across all three tiers competed in at least one test, with a record 27 matches including a tier 2 or tier 3 side, seven of which were a tier 1 v tier 2 fixture, as World Rugby tried to build on the tier 2 success in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, moving towards the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Coinciding with the international window, the 2016 Cup of Nations took place, bringing the total number of matches up to 51 for 31 nations. Australia attempted their first Grand Slam tour of the Home Nations since 2013. It was their tenth attempt at a Grand Slam, which they have achieved on only one occasion, in 1984. Australia were unsuccessful in their grand slam attempt, losing to both Ireland and England. In addition to their Grand Slam tour, Australia also played France, before playing the French Barbarians for the first time since 2005. World Champions New Zealand played Ireland twice, one of which was played at the historic Soldier Field stadium in Chicago, the venue having previously hosted tests between the Eagles, All Blacks and Wallabies in 2014 and 2015. The game gave Ireland their first victory over New Zealand at the 29th attempt, in a rivalry dating back to 1905. The other Ireland v New Zealand test took place in Ireland as part of the All Blacks' European tour, which also saw them play Italy and France. England and Wales both played host to Argentina and South Africa, while the Pumas and Springboks also travelled to Scotland and Italy respectively. As in recent seasons, New Zealand and Australia played the third and final Bledisloe Cup Test match for the year, with New Zealand having already secured the cup 2–0 during the 2016 Rugby Championship.\nTier 2 teams.\nUnlike previous November tests, World Rugby has given more tier 2 nations a tier 1 fixture, seeing not only the touring Pacific Island nations; Fiji, Samoa and Tonga compete against a top side, but also Canada, Georgia and Japan. Fiji will play England, France will host Samoa, while Italy will host Tonga. Ireland will play host to Canada in what will be Canada's first visit to Ireland, and a tier 1 nation (excluding World Cup years), since November 2008. Georgia will visit Scotland for the first ever time, playing just their second ever test against each other, the first outside a Rugby World Cup. It will be the first time since November 2014 that Georgia has played a tier 1 test, excluding their 2015 World Cup games against Argentina and New Zealand. Japan will play host to Argentina for the first time since 1998, in what will be the first test between the two nations since 2005, before Japan travels to Wales for the first time since 2007. It will be their first encounter against each other since June 2013, when Japan earned their first ever victory over the Welsh.\nFollowing a reduced 2016 World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup to include just the Pacific nations, World Rugby organized intercontinental matches between the Pacific Islanders, North America and Japan at neutral venues in Europe; Fiji will play Japan and Samoa will play Canada in France, while Tonga will play the United States in Spain. In addition to these tests, Japan and Samoa will be hosted by Georgia, while both Canada and the United States will travel to Romania. Uruguay will play their first ever 3-test European tour having secured tier 2 status. They will visit Spain for the first time since 2011 and Romania in a first ever one-off test outside any tournament. They will also play Germany in what will be the first ever meeting between the two sides. It will also be a first meeting for Spain and Tonga when they play each other in Madrid. In Belgium's only test, they will travel to Portugal in what be the team's first one-off test outside any tournament.\nTier 3 and invitational teams.\nAs part of World Rugby's strategy to provide increasing support to cross-regional international competition, Brazil embarked on their first ever European tour, playing a two-test series against Germany, in what was Germany's first ever home test against Brazil, and their first non-European opponent at home since Hong Kong in 2010. It was the first time since the 2011 Cup of Nations that Brazil has left the Americas region for a test match. Furthermore, Portugal played host to the Brazilians for the first ever time, having already played in Brazil in November 2013. In addition to Brazil's historic tour, Chile played host to their first ever Asian team when South Korea plays a two-test series against Los Condores. It was the first time that South Korea has left the Asian region for a test match since playing Tonga in 2007, and their first non-qualifying test match since playing Australia in 1987.\nSeveral invitational teams were in action during the window, where the Barbarians played three national sides; South Africa, competing for the Killik Cup, Fiji and Czech Republic. The Czech Republic were the first team outside the elite 20 nations since Belgium in May 2008. It will serve as a celebration match for the 90th anniversary of the Czech Rugby Union. The Māori All Blacks toured for the first time since 2014, playing the United States in Chicago, in a match that was part of 'The Rugby Weekend', doubling up with the Ireland–New Zealand game the same weekend. The Māori All Blacks later travelled to Europe, playing Irish side Munster in Limerick and English side Harlequins in London.\nFixtures.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes: \nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:"

The 1895 race was between the Herreshoff designed sloop \"Defender\" owned by Charles Oliver Iselin, William Kissam Vanderbilt, and Edwin Dennison Morgan from the New York Yacht Club, and the Watson designed \"Valkyrie III\" owned by Lord Dunraven of the Royal Yacht Squadron.\nThe races.\nFirst race.\nThe first race, on September 7, 1895, was set to be a windward-leeward course of fifteen miles length. The Weather for the day was described as light and shifting wind. In the first leg of the course the racing was close with \"Defender\" taking a slight lead by the windward mark. After rounding the mark the wind shifted, turning the running leg into a reaching leg, as a result \"Defender\" quickly increased its lead against \"Valkyrie III\". \"Defender\" crossed the line eight minutes and forty-nine seconds ahead of \"Valkyrie III\" to win the first race.\nSecond race.\nThe second race occurred on Tuesday September 10, 1895. The race was set as a triangle course with each leg having a length of ten miles. In the pre-start maneuvering, \"Valkyrie III\"'s boom struck \"Defender\", severing the starboard spreader. \"Valkyrie III\" led throughout the race, although \"Defender\" closed the gap between the boats in the second and third legs of the race. \"Valkyrie III\" crossed the line forty-seven seconds before \"Defender\". However, after hearing the protest from \"Defender\" against \"Valkyrie III\", the Race Committee awarded \"Defender\" the race as it ruled \"Defender\" had right of way over \"Valkyrie III\" as \"Defender\" was leeward of \"Valkyrie III\" at the time of collision.\nThird race.\nThe third race was sailed on Thursday September 12, 1895. After both \"Defender\" and \"Valkyrie III\" crossed the starting line sailing before the wind, \"Valkyrie III\" withdrew from the race claiming the committee could not guarantee a course that was free of spectator craft. \"Defender\" completed the race, winning the best of five regatta."

        "text": "The 2000 Rugby League World Cup final was the conclusive game of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup tournament and was played between Australia and New Zealand on November 25, 2000 at Old Trafford, Trafford, Greater Manchester, England.\nBackground.\nThe 2000 Rugby League World Cup was the twelfth staging of the Rugby League World Cup since its inauguration in 1954, and the first since the 1995 tournament. The tournament was held in the United Kingdom, Ireland and France from 28 October, culminating in the final between Australia and New Zealand on 25 November.\nAustralia.\nAustralia were undefeated going into the final. Their 110-4 win over Russia set a new world record test match score.\nNew Zealand.\nLike Australia, New Zealand were also undefeated going into the Final\nSummary.\nIn a high-scoring final at Old Trafford, the Kangaroos overwhelmed their Trans-Tasman opponents. Wendell Sailor scored two tries and Mat Rogers had a near-perfect afternoon with the boot as the Australians ran out 40–12 winners and were crowned world champions for a sixth successive time.\nMatch details.\nNew Zealand second rower Stephen Kearney became the most capped forward in New Zealand test match history playing in his 36th test.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\nFirst half.\nAustralia stepped on the gas from the kick-off, tearing into New Zealand at every opportunity. But the Kiwi defence stood firm, although they almost conceded after 22 minutes. Sailor looked to have scored the first try of the game after a burst down the right wing only for video referee Gerry Kershaw to rule that Stephen Kearney had prevented the Brisbane Broncos player from grounding the ball. The look of disbelief on Sailor's face was there for everyone to see, but he clearly did not let the decision affect his game. Three minutes later, his grubber kick was pounced on by Matt Gidley, who beat Kearney to the touch down. Rogers, assuming the kicking duties in place of the injured Ryan Girdler, landed the conversion to open up a 6–0 lead. New Zealand had few opportunities to go on the offensive, although they finished the first half strongly. But it was the favourites Australia who looked in control and deservedly went into the break in front.\nSecond half.\nThe start of the second half was held up by the appearance of a male streaker. When play finally got under way, the tackles were just as ferocious as ever, neither side giving an inch. However Australia gained the edge when Brad Fittler split the defence with a pass to Nathan Hindmarsh, who scored from close range, bringing the score to 10–0. Rogers converted to make it 12–0. New Zealand were not about to throw in the towel and hit back almost immediately. Lesley Vainikolo pounced on a loose ball to dive over on 49 minutes, although the decision was again made by the video referee. When Henry Paul landed the conversion, the deficit was back down to six points. Soon after, Australian Halfback, Brett Kimmorley, made a break down the right before feeding the ball inside to fullback Darren Lockyer, who crossed for another try. Rogers' third successful kick made it 18–6 to the defending champions. However, the Kiwis quickly struck back when Tonie Carroll beat several Australian defenders to score. Henry Paul's conversion made it 18–12.\nNew Zealand then made several crucial errors and Australia were able to capitalise. Sailor grabbed two tries in the space of five minutes to take his tally for the tournament to 10. The first of them came on 63 minutes courtesy of a reverse pass from Gidley. Rogers missed the second of the two quick conversions. Skipper Fittler then breached the New Zealand defence on 73 minutes to score his first try of the final which was converted by Rogers. Substitute Trent Barrett then finished the scoring, with a try that was converted by Rogers."

        "text": "Stages Cycling is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, with manufacturing and R&amp;D based in Boulder, Colorado. In 2012 Stages Cycling launched its first cycling power meter, where power is measured exclusively on the left-crank arm. Now they have a complete line of outdoor cycling power meters compatible with a range of cranks along with an indoor cycling bike.\nHistory.\nIn 2010 the core design and executive team, with a background in the indoor fitness industry, began developing a tool to change power measurement for indoor-cycling. It was in the indoor fitness market where the first Stages Power Meter was originally brought to life and tested, eventually turning into the outdoor Stages Cycling Meter\nThe first outdoor meter launched in 2012. Stages Cycling was the first cycling power meter to use Bluetooth and ANT+ software on a meter allowing it to be easily updated with firmware. The meter also was the first to have Active Temperature Compensation, keeping the meter accurate despite changing climates, without the need to stop pedaling to recalibrate. The meter also employed the use of an accelerometer to measure cadence, eliminating the need for any external sensors, cables or moving parts, which at the time of launch were necessary for many crank-based power measurement devices.\nIn 2015 Stages Cycling innovated again, launching the first ever carbon power meters allowing riders of carbon cranks to have a meter on their carbon crank. This marked the first ever carbon meter for Campagnolo.\nProducts.\nStages Power Meter.\nStages Cycling Power Meters are 65mm x 30mm x 100mm and weigh under 20g. Circuitry is housed in high-strength ABS-PC housing and adhered to the left crank-arm, preserving the structural integrity of the manufactures crank-arm. Stages Cycling produces its meter on a range of crank arms for all disciplines of cycling. Currently Stages sells and produces meters for cranks by Shimano, FSA, Cannondale, Sram and Campagnolo, as well as their own carbon Stages Power Meter for carbon cranks. The Stages Power Meter crank arm is manufactured by FSA and filled with hollow carbon carbon. It weighs 145 grams. It is compatible with 386EVO drive side cranks as well as SRAM Red 22, SRAM Force 22 and SRAM Rival 22 BB30 road and SRAM Mountain (168mm Q) BB30 drive side cranks. This compatibility is achieved by way of a range of BB30 bottom bracket spindles.\nStages Indoor Bike.\nIn the spring of 2015 Stages Cycling announced the introduction of a full indoor bike to its line. At first the bike was available only to trainers and clubs. By the end of 2015 the bike would be available for retail purchase.\nStages Indoor Bike is offered in two models SC3 and SC2. Both models include SprintShift, a dual-action resistance adjustment which pairs a traditional micro-adjust dial, seen on other indoor bikes, with a three-position macro-adjust lever. This allows for large, consistent jumps across resistance intervals, allowing for a smoother ride. The bikes also have FitLoc fit adjustment system and use Gates Corporation’s CarbonGlyde drive system and carbon belt drive.\nTechnology.\nMeasurements.\nTo measure torque, strain gauges which are precisely laid along the left crank arm. These gauges detect the flex of the crank arm when a downward force is applies. This force is multiplied by 9.8 m/s2 and the length of crank arm are used to determine the force applied to the pedal stroke, known as torque. To measure cadence, Stages Cycling uses an accelerometer. This is contained within the device's electronics to eliminate the need for additional sensor equipment. The accelerometer can capture multiple positions per revolution, resulting in more data. Once torque and cadence are collected, they are multiplied together to determine the power of a single stroke. This number is then multiplied by 2, assuming both legs are producing the same force. This is the key factor that allows Stages Power to exist on one side of the crank, and keeps the device small and economical. Stages Power Meters are also equipped with an on-board temperature sensor and adaptive algorithms to automatically compensate for temperature changes in the surrounding environment that would adversely affect the power meter's ability to measure force accurately. ANT+ and Bluetooth protocols are supported to allow the power meter to communicate report its data to cycling computers and other compatible receiving devices.\nPower values from the Stages Power device is calculated as expressed below:\nformula_1\nWhere 'P' suggests power in watts, 'F' denotes force in newtons, 'L' denotes crank arm length in millimeters, and 'R' denotes rotation rate in revolutions per minute. As seen, this value is multiplied by 2 to account for both legs.\nInnovations.\nSince the company's inception it has led the power meter market in many innovations and firsts that have been often adopted and emulated industry-wide.\nLeft Crank Based Power.\nStages Cycling was the first company to develop left-crank based power, applying strain gauges to the crank arm.\nANT+ and Bluetooth.\nStages Cycling was the first company to use both Bluetooth Smart protocol in addition to ANT+. This allowed a true two-way communication between Stages Power meters and smartphones or Bluetooth enabled head units.\nAccelerometer.\nStages Cycling was the first meter to use an accelerometer to measure cadence, allowing for the elimination of any external or moving parts in power measurement and collection.\nActive Temperature Compensation.\nStages developed Active Temperature Compensation creating the first meter that auto-calibrates for temperature changes without the need to stop pedaling, ensuring power measurement stays accurate.\nCarbon Cranks.\nAt Eurobike in 2015 Stages Cycling launched, becoming the first company to add power to carbon cranks, launching with its own Hollow Carbon filled meter produced by FSA compatible across a variety of carbon cranks, and a meter for with Campagnolo Super Record, Record and Chorus cranks."

These crickets are light yellowish tan and have two thick black bands. One of the bands runs through the bottom of the thorax while the other goes across the upper abdomen. Females are similar to males, only wingless and a long ovipositor emerging from its rear.\nRelationship with humans.\nAs pet food.\nDecorated house crickets are relatively new to the pet trade and are favored by many people due to easier care requirements than the more-common house cricket or the black field cricket. The banded crickets are said to be a lot more active than competitors, and live longer lifespans than the average house cricket. They also have a lower chitin content than average crickets, making digestibility easier. Tropical house crickets are also immune to the CrPV virus. Care is similar to that of the house cricket.\nAs pests.\nTropical house crickets generally cause no harm, though the singing males can be a nuisance. They can be managed with baits sold for cockroach or earwig control."

He led the NCAA major college players in 1946 with an average of 20.1 yards per punt return and set an unofficial national collegiate record with an average of 26.7 yards per return in 1947.\nEarly years.\nGriffin grew up in Tampa, Florida, and attended Hillsborough High School where he was selected as an All-Southern high school player in 1945.\nUniversity of Florida.\nGriffin enrolled at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, after first enrolling at Auburn University. He shared the Gators' backfield with Chuck Hunsinger from 1946 to 1949. As a freshman in 1946, he led all NCAA major college players with an average of 20.1 yards per punt return. On October 19, 1946, he returned a punt 98 yards down the right sideline for a touchdown in Florida's homecoming game against Miami.

In addition it has a satellite training facility in O'Briensbridge, County Clare. The club colours are royal blue and old gold.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1901, St Michael's Rowing Club started life in a small timber boathouse in the west end of the docks, close to the current dock gates. The first club Captain was the Nationalist MP for Limerick Michael Joyce. In the 1930s it was served with notice to quit as the land on which the boathouse stood was required for the dock expansion. After a period of inactivity and great uncertainty, a new boathouse was constructed at O'Callaghan Strand in 1940. Since then the club has grown and developed, and is currently one of the largest clubs affiliated to Rowing Ireland. In 2013 the club purchased a site in O'Briensbridge, County Clare adjacent to the Limerick Regatta field. This non-tidal facility can be used when weather conditions prohibit training on the lower Shannon. The club history was documented in \"Band of Gold\" which was published in November 2016.\nNational achievements.\nThe club is the most successful club in the mid-west region having won 60 National Championships.\nInternational achievements.\nIn excess of 300 green singlets have been won by club members.

Sinead Jennings won a silver medal in the women's Lightweight single sculls Championship in 2008.\nOlympians.\nThe club has had members represent Ireland on four occasions - Sam Lynch (Atlanta &amp; Athens), Sean O'Neill (Beijing). and Sinead Jennings (Rio)\nSt Michael's Head of the River.\nSt Michael's \"Head of the River\" race was first run in December 1981 with 34 crews. Since then it has grown to be the largest \"Head of the River\" event in the country, frequently attracting over 500 entries. Due to the difficulty in facilitating such large numbers in the reduced daylight in December, the Head was subsequently moved to February."

        "text": "The 1993 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France was a tour by the New Zealand national rugby league team. The New Zealand national rugby league team lost a series 0-3 against Great Britain but defeated Wales and France in one-off test matches. They also won games against Wigan, St Helens, Widnes, Leeds and the Great Britain under 23's.\nBackground.\nNew Zealand last toured Great Britain in 1989.\nEarlier in 1993, New Zealand had drawn 14-all with the Kangaroos at Mt Smart Stadium. This was the first ever draw between the two countries. They then lost 8-16 at the Palmerston North Showgrounds before finishing the 1993 Trans-Tasman Test series by going down 4-16 in Brisbane.\nThe New Zealand squad for those matches was: Morvin Edwards, Sean Hoppe, Jarrod McCracken, Dave Watson, Daryl Halligan, Tea Ropati, Gary Freeman (C), Se'e Solomona, Duane Mann, Brent Todd, Gary Mercer, Quentin Pongia, Tawera Nikau, Tony Kemp, Brendon Tuuta, Jason Donnelly, Stephen Kearney, Gavin Hill and John Lomax while Howie Tamati was the coach and Richard Bolton was the manager. All of this squad, with the exception of Gavin Hill and Tony Kemp, were also selected for the tour of Great Britain and France. However, before the tour, they lost McCracken (surgery) and Brent Todd (injury). The Kiwis would also be without goal kicking fullback Matthew Ridge (knee).\nThe Frank Endacott-coached Junior Kiwis toured Great Britain at the same time as the senior Kiwis, winning 11 of there 12 matches. Their captain, Henry Paul, was called up from the Junior Kiwis to join the main squad mid-tour.\nSquad.\nThis was the first time that no Auckland-based players were in the squad.\nHowie Tamati was the coach and Richard Bolton was the manager.\nFixtures.\nThe New Zealand side played a total of five test matches while on their European tour and one test in New Zealand before leaving.\nGreat Britain.\nTest Venues.\nThe three Great Britain vs New Zealand tests took place at the following venues.\nWales Test.\nThe Kiwis opened their tour with what was their first test against Wales since the 1975 Rugby League World Cup. That game, won 25-24 by the Welsh, was also played in Swansea but at the St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground.\nA disallowed try in the dying minutes was all that came between Wales pulling off the result of the decade in an exciting clash at Swansea.\nWales led for much of the first half. Two kicked penalties from Jonathan Davies and a drop goal from John Griffiths gave the impetus and on 27 minutes Davies put in a fantastic 40 yard kick to set up the flying Gareth Cordle to score Wales' first try.\nHowever New Zealand were kept in the game by a succession of goals from the classy kicker Daryl Harrigan, and when Quentin Pongia punished a rare weak kick from Davies to set up Mackie just before half-time, the Kiwis took a narrow lead.\nRopati extended the lead to 7 points after the restart before Jiffy's magic took hold on the game again. He kicked a penalty and then repeated the trick of the first half, sending another long kick over the defence to give Cordle his second. Wales smelt victory at 17-16 but almost immediately a lost ball from Devereux allowed Mackie to set up the strong running Sean Hoppe. Both sides exchanged penalties and with a few minutes to go John Devereux took advantage of a hoisted bomb to send Wales into rapture with what they thought was the winning try. Agonisingly for the home side, reserve back Adrian Hadley was correctly ruled offside and Wales' last chance to steal the match was gone.\nA famous victory had eluded Wales; nevertheless they had sent a clear message that they were building up to the World Cup and would be willing to take on anybody.\nKiwi forward Quentin Pongia was suspended for one game after being sent off for a high tackle.\nSurprisingly, Kiwi coach Howie Tamati elected to have Gene Ngamu kicking the goals despite the presence of 'superboot' Daryl Halligan at fullback in place of Morvin Edwards who was suffering from the flu. The ploy almost backfired as Ngamu only kicked one goal from five attempts. The match was highlighted by Sean Hoppe's 90 metre intercept try in the second half in which he left both Gary Connolly and Sam Panapa in his wake. Frano Botica, who would represent the Kiwis later in the test series, played against his national squad for Wigan.\n2nd Test.\nMartin Offiah's standing as the fastest player in rugby league took a beating during the second half when after making a break, he was unceremoniously bundled into touch after a 40-metre run by Kevin Iro. Offiah, recalled to the Lions test side after missing the first test at Wembley through injury, had a 3-metre head start on the Kiwi centre.\n3rd Test.\nGreat Britain wrapped up the series 3-0 with a commanding 29-10 win at Headingley in Leeds.\nAfter New Zealand lost the second test, and the series, coach Howie Tamati selected Aaron Whittaker at halfback over the incumbent captain, Gary Freeman. After the match Tamati stated \"I didn't believe I could win with Gary, it didn't come off but I believe the decision I made gave us a chance, whereas before we had no chance.\"\nThe match was highlighted by an 80-metre try to Lions fullback Jonathan Davies.\nFrance.\nFrench Test.\nThe Kiwis restored some pride by defeating France 36-11 in the test in Carcassonne.\nAftermath.\nFrank Endacott was appointed the new New Zealand coach from 1994. The Kiwis were next in Great Britain for the 1995 Rugby League World Cup."

The Crusaders, led by fifth year head coach Bryce Drew, played their home games at the Athletics–Recreation Center and were members of the Horizon League. They finished the season 30–7, 16–2 in Horizon League play to win the regular season championship. They lost in the semifinals of the Horizon League tournament to Green Bay. As a regular season conference champion who failed to win their conference tournament, received an automatic bid to the National Invitation Tournament. As one of the last four teams left out of the NCAA tournament, they received a #1 seed in the NIT where they defeated Texas Southern, Florida State, Saint Mary's, and BYU to advance to the championship game where they lost to George Washington.\nThis season was Bryce Drew's final season as Valparaiso head coach. He accepted the Vanderbilt head coaching job on April 5, 2016. He finished at Valpo with a five-year record of 124–49 and went to the postseason every year as head coach.\nPrevious season.\nThe Crusaders finished the 2014–15 season with an overall record of 28–6, and 13–3 to win the Horizon League regular season championship. They defeated Cleveland State and Green Bay to win the Horizon League tournament championship. They received an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament where they lost in the second round to Maryland.\nPre-season.\nOn July 31, 2015, the NCAA announced that senior Vashil Fernandez, the 2015 Horizon League Defensive Player of the Year, would be granted an additional year of eligibility.

The Crusaders won the Horizon League regular season championship, three games ahead of second place Oakland.\nAfter Valparaiso won the regular season Horizon League championship, a Fox Sports writer noted that the Crusaders' strengths were defense, rebounding, depth and experience, and that Valpo—\"perhaps the best mid-major team in college basketball this year\"—was still likely to be on the edge of the March Madness selection process. ESPN's Eamonn Brennan wrote that Valpo was \"a really good team that was banged up in nonconference play and -- in the Watch's humble opinion -- probably deserves to be in the tournament at the end of the day.\"\nIn January 2016, ESPN selected coach Bryce Drew as one of its ten national Coach of the Year finalists. As of late February 2016, the Crusaders allowed opponents 0.87 points per possession, best of all Division I teams. Senior center Vashil Fernandez was again the league's Defensive Player of the Year, and junior forward Alec Peters was named again to the All League First Team. For the third time in five seasons, Bryce Drew was named the league's Coach of the Year. Vashil Fernandez earned the 2016 Lefty Driesell Award as the nation's top defensive player.\nHowever, Valpo lost their first game of the Horizon League Tournament, losing to Green Bay in the semifinals. The Crusaders failed to receive an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.\nAs the winners of the Horizon League regular season, the Crusaders received an automatic bid to the National Invitation Tournament. Valpo received a #1 seed and defeated Texas Southern, Florida State, and Saint Mary's to advance to the NIT Final Four at Madison Square Garden. There, they defeated BYU to advance to the NIT Championship game versus George Washington. After a close first half, George Washington ran away with the game in the second half, defeating Valpo 76–60.\nFollowing the season, head coach Bryce Drew accepted the head coaching position at Vanderbilt.\nSchedule.\nThe 2015–2016 Valparaiso University men's basketball schedule is:\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#613318; color:#FFCC00;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#613318; color:#FFCC00;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#613318; color:#FFCC00;\"| Horizon League regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#613318; color:#FFCC00;\"|Horizon League tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#613318; color:#FFCC00;\"|NIT"

        "text": "Cricket Club, Aligarh Muslim University (formerly, MAO Cricket Club) was established in the year 1878 at Aligarh.\nClub history.\nCricket at Aligarh Muslim University started in 1878 when the mathematics professor, Rama Shankar Mishra, founded a cricket club, whose members were expected to wear a uniform of blue flannel coat, shirt, knickerbockers and cap. The club didn't at first thrive. It was not till Theodore Beck arrived in 1883 that real interest in cricket and sports began.\nThe club toured Simla, Patiala and Bombay and performed very well. In 1884 Theodore Beck took the club on a tour round the Punjab including a match against Government College, Lahore.\nWhen Indian team toured England in 1922, three players came from Aligarh.\nIn the year 1903 Oxford University Authentics visited India and played a two-day match at Aligarh. The match ended in a draw. On 18 &amp; 19 February 1927 the club played a first-class match against Marylebone Cricket Club at Willingdon Cricket Ground, Aligarh and lost. Nazir Ali also played for the club.\nAligarh Eleven won two consecutive matches against the Parsees cricket team. These two matches were held at Aligarh under the captainship of Khwaja M. Abdullah of Jalandhar. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and many other respected personalities came to view this match themselves.\nAligarh Eleven at that time was regarded as the best cricket team of the time in India – Professor Llewellyn Tipping.[3]\nThe remarkable historical match of 'MAO College Cricket Team' / 'Aligarh Eleven' was played in Patiala in February 1900 AD. It was played and won under the captaincy of Ali Hasan. The report of this victory was also published in The Pioneer. This match was against the team of His Highness Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. His Highness's team included J. T. Hearne (Middlesex) and W. Brockwell (Surrey). His Highness Maharajadhiraj Sir Bhupendra Singh, ruler of the erstwhile Patiala State, used to bring Patiala, British players of fame to play with and to coach his team players. He invited in his team J. T. Hearne (Middlesex), W. Brockwell (Surrey), C. B. Fry and Frank Tarrant. His Highness Maharajadhiraj Sir Bhupendra Singh donated to the most important national tournament, the Ranji Trophy, to perpetuate the memory of that great cricket wizard, the late His Highness Maharaja Ranjit Singh, lovingly known as \"Ranji\", about whom Neville Cardus said, \"It is not in nature that there should be another Ranji\".\nBy custom, the captain of the club stays at 13 SS East.\nIn first-class cricket.\nCricket Club, Aligarh Muslim University is the only university-based cricket club in India to have played first-class cricket. Playing as \"Aligarh Muslim University Past and Present\", it made its first-class debut against the Marylebone Cricket Club in a two-day match played on 18 and 19 February 1927 on its home ground. It went on to play two more first-class matches, against Hyderabad and Freelooters, in the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament in 1931.\nInter-Varsity Cricket Honours.\n\"Note:\" (*) indicates that before the season 1977/78 there were no matches held for third place."

It became a PGA Tour of Australasia event from 2009 until 2015, except for 2013 when it was not played, but has not been held since.\nKel Nagle won the event 7 times while Eric Cremin won it 5 times."

        "text": "Keenan Reynolds (born December 13, 1994) is an American former professional football wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Navy Midshipmen as a quarterback, earning third-team All-American honors in 2015. He finished his college career with an NCAA Division I record 88 career touchdowns and an FBS record 4,559 rushing yards by a quarterback. Reynolds currently serves in the United States Navy Reserve with the rank of lieutenant.\nEarly years.\nReynolds was born to Donald Reynolds, a former UT Martin football player, and Jacqueline Reynolds in Antioch, Tennessee. Reynolds started playing football at age five. He attended Goodpasture Christian School in Madison, where he led the school to a 27–6 record and consecutive district championships. He started for all four years. Reynolds also ran track and field, and was a member of the National Honor Society. Reynolds graduated in 2012 with four varsity letters.\nCollege career.\nAfter his senior year of high school, Reynolds received offers from Navy, Air Force, and Wofford. He also garnered interest from Middle Tennessee State and Vanderbilt. Eventually, he committed to Navy, being impressed by the school's campus and football record.\n2012 season.\nReynolds started his freshman season as the fourth-string quarterback, seeing minor action limited to garbage time. In the fourth game of the season against Air Force, starting quarterback Trey Miller injured his ankle and Reynolds took over, leading the Midshipmen to the win. Afterwards, Reynolds was named the starter, becoming the third freshman in school history to do so, for the final eight games of the season. The Midshipmen went 8–5 in 2012, but lost to the Arizona State Sun Devils in the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl 62–28.\n2013 season.\nIn 2013 against San Jose State, Reynolds scored seven rushing touchdowns, the most by a quarterback in NCAA history. At the end of the season, Reynolds had 29 rushing touchdowns, breaking Ricky Dobbs and Collin Klein's single season records. Navy finished the season 9–4 and won the Armed Forces Bowl against the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders.\n2014 season.\nReynolds started eleven games in 2014. Against Temple, Reynolds twisted his knee and missed the game against Texas State. The 8–5 Midshipmen ended the season with a 17–16 win over the San Diego State Aztecs in the Poinsettia Bowl.\n2015 season.\nIn the 2015 game against SMU, Reynolds broke the record for the most career rushing touchdowns in FBS history with 78, passing Montee Ball. Later in the season in the Army–Navy Game, Reynolds surpassed Adrian N. Peterson's record for the most rushing touchdowns in NCAA Division I history with 85. He later broke the record for most career total touchdowns with 88 and most rushing yards by a quarterback with 4,559. Reynolds also holds other quarterbacking records including the most career rushing attempts and touchdowns, most rushing touchdowns and most rushing touchdowns in a game. He is also the only Navy QB to go 4–0 against Army. Reynolds finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy running, the highest by a service academy player since Navy quarterback Roger Staubach's win in 1963. The 11–2 Midshipmen ended the season with a win over the Pittsburgh Panthers in the Military Bowl, winning 44–28 at home in their own stadium. With this win, Reynolds helped contribute to the first Navy team to ever achieve 11 wins in a season. Also, Reynolds and his senior class picked up their 36th win, which tied the Midshipmen class of 1909.\nReynolds later played in the 2016 East–West Shrine Game, an annual all-star game for seniors, where he made the East team upon switching from quarterback to running back. Even though he did not play in the game due to tightness in his back, he was made a unanimous captain for the East team. Moreover, during the East–West Shrine Game, Reynolds won the Pat Tillman Award, which \"is presented to a player who best exemplifies character, intelligence, sportsmanship, and service. The award is about a student-athlete's achievements and conduct, both on and off the field.\"\nOn February 28, 2016, the Naval Academy announced that Reynolds would be the last player to wear Number 19. Reynolds joins the list of Roger Staubach (No. 12), Joe Bellino (No. 27), and Napoleon McCallum (No. 30) whose numbers have been retired by the academy.\nReynolds returned to college football in 2019 as an analyst for CBS Sports Network.\nStatistics.\n\"Source\":\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nReynolds was not invited to the NFL Scouting Combine, but worked out as a wide receiver with the Tennessee Titans and New England Patriots, while also attending a pro day with the Baltimore Ravens.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nIn the 2016 NFL Draft, the Baltimore Ravens selected Reynolds in the sixth round with the 182nd overall pick.\nOn September 3, 2016, Reynolds was released by the Ravens during final team cuts and was signed to the practice squad the following day. He was promoted to the active roster on December 30 for the final game of the season. However, he was on the inactive list for the game, and became an exclusive rights free agent after the season.\nReynolds signed his exclusive rights free agent one-year contract tender with the Ravens on April 26, 2017. On September 1, 2017, he was waived by the Ravens during final roster cuts.\nWashington Redskins.\nOn November 8, 2017, Reynolds was signed to the Washington Redskins' practice squad.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nOn May 16, 2018, Reynolds signed with the Seattle Seahawks.

He spent the 2019 training camp competing to replace the retiring Doug Baldwin, but lost to John Ursua and was waived on August 31.\nSeattle Dragons.\nIn October 2019, Reynolds was selected by the Seattle Dragons of the XFL in the 2020 XFL Draft. Dragons head coach Jim Zorn described Reynolds as his \"secret weapon\", playing receiver, returner, and emergency quarterback.\nPrior to the start of the 2020 XFL season, he was named a team captain on special teams. In Seattle's first game against the DC Defenders, Reynolds returned the opening kickoff and caught an extra point as the Dragons lost 31–19. He had his contract terminated when the league suspended operations on April 10, 2020.\nNaval career.\nReynolds graduated from the United States Naval Academy in May 2016. To dedicate more time to playing professional football, he currently serves in the U.S. Navy Reserve as a lieutenant junior grade. He is a cryptologic warfare officer in the Naval Reserves; he had considered becoming a naval flight officer after the Academy, but elected to enter intelligence after the Navy revised its eligibility policies for the field."

        "text": "The IRP Men's Try of the Year is an accolade awarded annually by World Rugby at the World Rugby Awards. The International Rugby Players (IRP) – formerly International Rugby Players Association – select the nominees from which the winner is decided by a public vote. , the IRPA selection panel comprises Isaac Boss (representing Rugby Players Ireland), Andries Pretorius (Welsh Rugby Players Association), Hale T-Pole (Pacific Players Association) and Stefan Terblanche (South African Rugby Players Association).\nThe inaugural winner of the IRPA Try of the Year trophy in 2007 was the Zimbabwean-born United States wing Takudzwa Ngwenya. His try, considered by the Bleacher Report as one of the greatest in history, completed a counter-attack for the United States against South Africa (also known as the Springboks) in the group stage of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Receiving the ball on the halfway line, Ngwenya outpaced Bryan Habana, then considered to be the fastest player in international rugby, to score. Brian O'Driscoll received the award in 2008 for Ireland's team try scored during their 18–12 defeat against Australia. Starting from a lineout inside their own 22, Ireland caught their own kick as they moved up to the halfway line. An exchange of passes culminated with O'Driscoll receiving the ball out before scoring. The 2009 award went to South Africa's Jaque Fourie who scored the decisive try in a game described as \"one of the great matches of all time\" against the British and Irish Lions. Fourie's try in the 74th minute levelled the scores with Morné Steyn kicking a penalty with the final act of the match to take the win for South Africa.\nEngland's Chris Ashton won the IRPA Try of the Year award in 2010. Having already scored against Australia in the first half, Ashton ran to score his second, completed with a \"swan dive\" as he crossed the tryline in what has been described as \"one of the great Twickenham scores\". The press dubbed the celebratory dive the \"Ash-Splash\". The 2011 award was presented to Australia's Radike Samo for his solo effort against New Zealand (also known as the All Blacks), described by \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" as \"one of the great forward tries\". Bryan Habana became the second South African to win the award for his try against the All Blacks in 2012. Running between two defending players and chipping the ball over a third, Habana slid in to score in the Springboks' 21–11 defeat in the 2012 Rugby Championship. The 2013 recipient of the award was New Zealand's Beauden Barrett who finished off an All Black move against France which had started just outside their own tryline.\nFrancois Hougaard's try for South Africa against New Zealand earned him the 2014 IRPA Try of the Year award. He completed a move after eight passes which had started on the Springbok tryline, and helped consign the All Blacks to their first defeat in almost two years. All Black Julian Savea won the award in 2015 with one of three tries he scored in New Zealand's comprehensive 62–13 defeat over France in the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Robert Kitson of \"The Observer\" described the award-winning try as a \"stunner that took him past and through [Louis] Picamoles, Brice Dulin and Rabah Slimani in a manner reminiscent of Lomu's flattening of Mike Catt in Cape Town in 1995\". The winner of the 2016 award was Ireland's Jamie Heaslip who finished off a team move which started inside their own 22 against Italy during the 2016 Six Nations Championship. The 2017 IRPA Try of the Year was awarded to Argentina's Joaquín Tuculet for his try, completing a team effort which started deep inside his half, against England in San Juan."

        "text": "The 2015 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented University of Santo Tomas in the 78th season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The men's basketball tournament for the school year 2015-16 began on September 5, 2015 and the host school for the season was the University of the Philippines.\nUST made it back to the playoffs after getting eliminated in Season 77. They finished the double round-robin eliminations at first place with 11 wins against 3 losses. The FEU Tamaraws had the same win–loss record but were ranked lower on an inferior -10 quotient. The last time that the Tigers got the top seed was in 1995 when they won their third straight championship. It was also the last time that they won as many as 11 games at the end of eliminations in a season.\nThey had a twice-to-beat advantage over their Final Four opponent and defending champions, the NU Bulldogs who they defeated in one game to advance to the Finals against FEU. NU has been the Tigers' semifinal opponent for the third time in the last four years. UST became the fifth team in UAAP history to reach the Finals after missing the Final Four playoffs in the previous season.\nIn Game Two of the Finals series, Kevin Ferrer's 24 points in the third quarter broke the UAAP record for most points scored in a period. He tied his career-high of 29 points in their 62–56 win over FEU to extend the series to a deciding Game Three. In that game, UST was also able to limit the Tamaraws to their lowest scoring output, as they have not scored lower than 60 points in the season. FEU won the series in three games, ending a decade-long wait to claim their 20th men's basketball championship. The Tigers who had faced FEU in the Finals for the first time since 1979 won both games against them in the elimination rounds.\nUST recorded the most three point shots made in the season with 89 for a league-best 31% field goal percentage. They also held the highest free throw conversion of 68.4% among all teams.\nGraduating players Ferrer and Ed Daquioag were included in the Mythical team selection during the presentation of awards. Ferrer was chosen back-to-back Player of the Week by the UAAP Press Corps for the duration of September 23–27 and on the week of September 30-October 4, while Daquioag received the citation for the period of September 9–13.\nCoaching staff.\nEstong Ballesteros, the Growling Tigers' assistant coach for offense and trainer has resigned from his post. He had informed head coach Bong dela Cruz of his decision to concentrate on coaching the Philippine National Police basketball team in the MBL and as deputy to Lawrence Chongson at Tanduay in the PBA D-League.\nRene Baena was hired to replace Ballesteros. The veteran coach who was a member of UST's track and field team was an assistant coach of the Adamson Baby Falcons juniors' basketball team. He has coached the juniors teams of La Salle Greenhills, Ateneo U13, and the San Beda Red Cubs in the past. He has also served as an assistant coach of the UE Red Warriors team that made it to the UAAP Finals in 2009.\nFour-time Philippine Basketball Association MVP Alvin Patrimonio has also come on board as consultant and trainer of the team's big men.\nInjuries.\nForwards Joco Macaseat and Regie Boy Basibas were excluded from the roster with both suffering from year-long injuries. Macasaet tore his ACL while lifting weights in the offseason, while Basibas had some issues with his groin.\nKarim Abdul, Louie Vigil, and Kyle Suarez also fell to various injures in the summer, but all three were able to play in the UAAP. Abdul underwent surgery on his left knee in April to have his bone spurs removed. Vigil failed to suit for the Tigers in the Filoil Flying V tournament as he got sidelined by a hamstring injury, and while Suarez was able to play after recovering from an ACL injury in December, he reinjured it during a game against the De La Salle Green Archers in the first round.\nMario Bonleon and Renzo Subido also missed games during the season. Bonleon hurt his finger during practice and was not able to play against the Adamson Falcons in the first round, while Subido also had an ACL injury before their Finals series with FEU.\nSchedule and results.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format. All games were aired on ABS-CBN Sports and Action and Balls. The second game of the Finals series was aired on ABS-CBN and Balls.\nPostseason tournament.\nThe Philippine Collegiate Champions League games were aired on ABS-CBN Sports and Action.\nUAAP statistics.\nPlayoffs.\nSource: HumbleBola\nPlayers drafted into the PBA.\nKevin Ferrer and Ed Daquioag, both members of the Gilas national team training pool applied for the 2016 PBA draft and were selected through a special draft separate from the regular rookie applicants on October 30, 2016.\nFerrer was selected by the Tim Cone-led Barangay Ginebra San Miguel team as the second pick, while Daquioag ended up with the Norman Black-coached Meralco Bolts for the special draft's sixth overall pick."

The long time VBA general manager was former Australian and long time Melbourne Tigers coach Lindsay Gaze and the manager's residence was the home of the Gaze family, which included Lindsay's son Andrew and nephew Mark, who both played for Australia as Lindsay had done in the 1950s and 1960s. Andrew Gaze later told that his father and he would spend many nights by themselves either in their back yard (on one of the 7 outdoor courts) or in the 2,000-seat stadium working on his game, though Lindsay just said that to him it was father and son spending time together."

        "text": "Jimmy Black (born November 20, 1960) is an American former college basketball player and assistant coach. He was the starting point guard and a captain of the 1981–82 national champion North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team.\nCollege career.\nLargely attributable to his quickness, Black led his team in steals and was considered the top defender on his team. He served as his team's quarterback and had innate court sense.\nBlack played in the NCAA Tournament all four years at UNC. As the playmaker on the 1981–82 championship team, he was responsible for directing the ball to teammates James Worthy, Sam Perkins and freshman swingman Michael Jordan. Black had a close relationship with coach Dean Smith.\nBlack's mother died during his sophomore season at UNC.\n1981–82 season.\nAlong with the likes of Dale Ellis, Patrick Ewing, and Clark Kellogg, Black was among 22 Honorable Mentions for the 1982 UPI (United Press International) All-America Team. Black was selected to play in the Pizza Hut East-West All-Star Classic in Las Vegas on April 3, 1982, along with such contemporaries as Chuck Nevitt and Louisville's Derek Smith.\nPrior to the 1982 tournament, Black called a special team meeting, a sort of pep rally, to pump up the team, focusing on Dean Smith's six Final Four appearances without a title. During the tournament, Black was named to the East Regional All-Star Team with per game averages of 11.3 points on 88% shooting from the field to go with 6.7 assists in three games.\nIn the national semifinal, Black guarded the University of Houston's Rob Williams so well that he did not score a field goal (0–8).\nIn the national championship game, Black had 4 points, 3 rebounds, 7 assists and a steal in 38 minutes, including the pass to Michael Jordan for the game-winning shot.\nAfter college.\nBlack was the 59th pick in the 1982 NBA draft, but he did not play in the NBA. He did sign waivers with the New Jersey Nets, but was waived on October 25, 1982 near the final cut for the team.\nAfter his playing days, Black worked as a graduate assistant at UNC in the 1983–84 season, and then as an assistant coach at several colleges: Saint Joseph's, South Carolina and Notre Dame. In 1995, Black resigned from his position at Notre Dame and was replaced by Parker Laketa.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1995, Black was arrested on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge for purportedly striking his fiancée on the leg on December 13, 1994. This followed previous incidents, including an October 1994 police report in which Black's fiancée was treated at a hospital for a black eye and other injuries."

        "text": "David James Hess (born July 10, 1993) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles, Miami Marlins, and Tampa Bay Rays.\nAmateur career.\nHess played baseball at Tullahoma High School in Tullahoma, Tennessee. As a senior, he had a 8–1 win–loss record with a 1.91 earned run average (ERA) along with batting .393 with eight home runs. After high school, he enrolled at Tennessee Technological University and played college baseball for the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles. In 2014, his junior year, he pitched to a 9-3 record with a 3.24 ERA in 16 starts.\nProfessional career.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nAfter the season, Hess was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the fifth round of the 2014 Major League Baseball draft. He made his professional debut with the Aberdeen IronBirds and also spent time with the Delmarva Shorebirds; in ten total games between the two teams, he pitched to a 2–1 record and 3.24 ERA. He started 2015 with the Frederick Keys and was promoted to Bowie Baysox during the season. In 28 games (27 starts) between both clubs, he posted a 10–5 record and a 3.64 ERA. He returned to Bowie in 2016, going 5–13 with a 5.37 ERA in 25 games (24 starts). In 2017, he once again returned to Bowie, pitching to an 11–9 record with a 3.85 ERA with 123 strikeouts in a career high 154.1 innings pitched. The Orioles added Hess to their 40-man roster after the 2017 season.\nHess made his major league debut on May 12, 2018 against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. He pitched six innings, giving up three earned runs on six hits, three strikeouts, and zero walks. He remained in the Orioles rotation, totaling 21 appearances, 19 of them starts. He went 3-10 in innings.\nIn his first start of the 2019 season in a 6–5 win over the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre on April 1, Hess had a no-hit bid through 6 1/3 innings before being removed by manager Brandon Hyde in favor of Pedro Araújo. With his record at 1–10 by the end of the campaign, he and Gabriel Ynoa became the first pair of teammates with double-digit losses and no more than one win since Jack Nabors and Tom Sheehan of the 1916 Philadelphia Athletics.\nHess only appeared in 3 games for the Orioles in 2020, and gave up 5 runs over 7 innings pitched. On October 29, 2020, Hess was outrighted off of the 40-man roster and became a free agent.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn December 3, 2020, Hess signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays organization. Hess posted a 2.81 ERA through 13 appearances with the Triple-A Durham Bulls.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn July 3, 2021, the Rays traded Hess to the Miami Marlins in exchange for Justin Sterner and cash considerations. The Marlins selected Hess' contract to the active roster following his acquisition. On August 14, 2021, Hess was designated for assignment by the Marlins. On August 18, Hess rejected his outright assignment and elected free agency.\nTampa Bay Rays (second stint).\nOn August 19, 2021, Hess signed a minor league deal to return to the Tampa Bay Rays and was assigned to Triple-A Durham. On August 21, the Rays selected Hess' contract. The following day, Hess was designated for assignment without appearing in a game. On August 24, Hess cleared waivers and was assigned outright back to Triple-A Durham. Hess's contract was selected on September 6.

        "title": "2015 Rugby World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2015 Rugby World Cup final was a rugby union match to determine the winner of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, played between reigning champions New Zealand and their rivals Australia on 31 October 2015 at Twickenham Stadium in London. New Zealand beat Australia 34–17, winning the World Cup for a record third time, and becoming the first team to retain the Webb Ellis Cup. The 51 points scored in this final is the highest of all Rugby World Cup finals.\nThis match saw a new record for tries in a Rugby World Cup final with the teams combining for five, surpassing the previous record of four scored in the 1987 final. It was only the second final between two teams from the Southern Hemisphere, the previous one being South Africa's win over New Zealand in 1995.\nRoute to the final.\nNew Zealand.\nHaving been in band 1 in the draw, New Zealand were placed as the top team participating in Pool C. They began their tournament with a steady performance against Argentina, earning a 26–16 victory (though having been 13–12 down at half time) in front of a then-record crowd of 89,019 at Wembley on 20 September. On that day, their starting XV was the most experienced ever. Their performance remained steady four days later with a 58–14 win over Namibia in which they scored nine tries. On 2 October, they faced Georgia – their first ever encounter – at the Millennium Stadium, with Julian Savea scoring a hat-trick to help New Zealand to a 43–10 win. New Zealand's last pool match was on 9 October, with their performance improving to reach a successful 47–9 victory over Tonga, which included a try by Ma'a Nonu who earned his 100th test cap during the match.\nIn the quarter-finals, the All Blacks faced France, the last team to beat New Zealand in a Rugby World Cup match (in the quarter-final stage of the 2007 Rugby World Cup, also at the Millennium Stadium). However, New Zealand crushed France 62–13, the highest winning margin in a World Cup knockout game since their win over Wales in 1987. Julian Savea scored a second hat-trick in the rout, equaling Jonah Lomu and Bryan Habana's record of eight tries in a World Cup. New Zealand reached the final after defeating South Africa 20–18 in a tight semi-final on 24 October, where New Zealand became the first ever nation to make four Rugby World Cup finals, having previously made the 1987, 1995 and 2011 tournament deciders.\nAustralia.\nHaving also been in band 1 in the draw, Australia were placed as the top team in Pool A, and began their campaign with a 28–13 win over Fiji in Cardiff. Head Coach Michael Cheika, who had only been in charge of the team since 22 October 2014, had been open about the short four-day turn-around between Fiji and Uruguay, and openly admitted he would field two different starting XVs against either team. Had it not been for an injury to James Slipper in the Fiji game, Cheika would have followed this through; instead, he made 14 changes for the match against Uruguay. On 27 September, they crushed Uruguay 65–3, scoring 11 tries, including two each for Sean McMahon, Ben McCalman and Drew Mitchell. They then went on to defeat hosts England at Twickenham, with Bernard Foley scoring two tries, kicking all three conversions and scoring all four penalties in a record 33–13 win. On 10 October, Australia won 15–6 against Wales in the last game of the pool stage; no tries were scored in the match — the first time this had happened since 1947 — but Foley scored five of the six penalties that he took. During the match, Australia successfully defended for nearly 10 minutes with two players in the sin bin, a period of play that was widely referred to in the media as potentially \"defining\" the Australian campaign.\nAustralia nearly lost their quarter-final match on 18 October, requiring a controversial last-minute penalty from Foley to beat Scotland 35–34. The decision by referee Craig Joubert to award a penalty was later deemed incorrect by World Rugby, who issued a statement saying Joubert should have given a scrum instead. Despite this, Australia went on to the semi-final and faced Argentina. They defeated the Pumas 29–15, to reach the final, to become the second team, after New Zealand, to make four Rugby World Cup finals, having previously played in the 1991, 1999 and 2003 finals.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nNew Zealand played with most of the possession and territory early in the match. After eight minutes, Dan Carter scored the first points in the match, putting New Zealand ahead 3–0. In the 15th minute New Zealand fullback Ben Smith knocked the ball on, and from the resulting scrum New Zealand were penalised when their front row collapsed allowing Bernard Foley to tie the scores. Referee Nigel Owens awarded a penalty to New Zealand after Sekope Kepu made a high tackle on Dan Carter. Carter successfully kicked a penalty goal, and gave New Zealand a three-point lead. At the kick off Wallabies lock Kane Douglas injured his knee jumping for the ball, and was replaced by Dean Mumm. At 26 minutes Wallabies centre Matt Giteau suffered concussion tackling All Blacks lock Brodie Retallick and was replaced by Kurtley Beale. At 27 minutes Carter stretched New Zealand's lead with another penalty goal. The first try was scored just before halftime with New Zealand winger Nehe Milner-Skudder touching down in the corner. Carter converted giving New Zealand a lead of 16–3 at the end of the first half.\nTwo minutes into the second half, New Zealand's replacement centre Sonny Bill Williams offloaded the ball to Ma'a Nonu who beat a handful of Australian defenders to score a try, extending the lead to 21–3. In the 52nd minute, New Zealand fullback Ben Smith was sin-binned after tip-tackling Australia's Drew Mitchell. While Smith was in the sin-bin, Australia ran in two tries – the first to number eight David Pocock from a driving maul, and the second to centre Tevita Kuridrani following a kick to score. Foley converted both tries to bring Australia within four points with 16 minutes remaining. With 10 minutes left on the clock, Carter kicked a drop goal from 40 metres to open up the gap to seven points. Several minutes later, New Zealand were awarded a penalty, with Carter converting long range to give New Zealand a 27–17 lead. Needing to score quick tries to stay in the match, Australia lost the ball, which was kicked ahead by Ben Smith, allowing Beauden Barrett to chase and score the clinching try. Carter converted the try with his right (non-dominant) foot, to make the final score 34–17.\nNew Zealand became the first team in the History of the Rugby World Cup to successfully defend their title after eight editions of the tournament. They also became the first team to win three Rugby World Cups, previously winning the 1987 and 2011 editions, both of which were held on home soil, making this occasion the first time that New Zealand won the tournament on foreign soil.\nDetails.\nNotes:\nClosing ceremony.\nAt the closing ceremony on 31 October, English singer Laura Wright sang World in Union. This was followed by the handover to Japan for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Prince Harry presented the Webb Ellis Cup to winning captain Richie McCaw after the match, once the team's name had been engraved on the base of the trophy."

        "text": "The Ecuador national rugby league team (\"Spanish: rugby league equipo nacional de Ecuador\") represents Ecuador in rugby league. They made their debut at the first ever Latino Sevens on 17 October 2015 against Peru.\nHistory.\nThe sport of rugby league is at its inception and earliest stage of growth in Ecuador. However, efforts are being put in place to increase the exposure and participation of rugby league in Central and South America through the Latin Heat Rugby League.\nIn April 2015, Latin Heat volunteer and ambassador Matthew Brown created a Facebook page called \"Ecuador Rugby XIII\" to help create interest in starting Rugby League in Ecuador. He also lived in the country for 6 months.\nWhile there, he helped create a partnership between Touch Rugby Ecuador and Ecuador Rugby XIII. Touch Rugby Ecuador is an organisation (mainly made up of expats from Rugby nations living in Quito, Ecuador) that plays social games of Touch Rugby every Saturday at Carolina Park. The basic idea behind combining the two organisations was that Rugby is quite small in Ecuador, and working together would encourage native Ecuadorians to try both forms of rugby.\nLater, Brown met with Fenrir Rodriguez, who was interested in helping start the Ecuador Rugby XIII. The Latin Heat were able to recruit enough Ecuadorian players, and on 17 October 2015, the newly established Ecuadorian rugby league team competed in its first international competition - The Latino Rugby League Sevens at New Era Stadium, Cabramatta. \nOther Latin nations such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina already play the sport and along with other efforts to start the game up in countries such as El Salvador, Haiti, Colombia, Uruguay, Chile and Peru, it is hoped that Ecuador can learn from their neighbours and receive support while attempting to further Rugby League on home soil.\nInaugural Team 2015.\nThe following is the Ecuadorian teamed named for the 2015 Latino Sevens.\nScott Correa,\nRodney Garcia (Co-Captain),\nAndres Garzon,\nFrank Jacome,\nSebastian Jacome,\nJeff Lopez (Co-Captain),\nDahcell Ramos-Malo,\nGeovanny Sanchez,\nSandro Sanchez,\nRoberto Tacuri,\nJuan Torres,\nJohnny Vasco\nPlayers for Ecuador to date.\nScott Correa, Rodney Garcia (Co-Captain), Andres Garzon, William Gomez, Frank Jacome, Sebastian Jacome, Johnny Liszka, Jeff Lopez (Co-Captain), Dahcell Ramos-Malo, Jay Palese, Johnny Pandilla, Geovanny Sanchez, Sandro Sanchez, Edgar Santamaria, Roberto Tacuri, Juan Torres, Johnny Vasco\nResults.\n\"Latino Rugby League Sevens Tournament, New Era Stadium (17/10/2015)\".\nPeru vs Ecuador\nPeru 28 (Jacob Parker 2, James Goncalves 2, Aaron Perez tries; J Goncalves 2, J Parker, A Perez goals) defeat Ecuador 0. Halftime score: Peru 16-0.\nEcuador vs Colombia\nEcuador 18 (Johnny Vasco 2, Sebastian Jacome, Roberto Tacuri tries; Rodney Garcia goal) defeat Colombia 8 (Sebastian Maya Jimenez, Andres Marino Silva tries). Halftime score: 4-4.\n\"Sevens Match \"El Escudo del Sur\", Henson Oval (11/06/2016)\".\nEcuador vs Colombia\nGame 1\nEcuador 16 (Jay Pelese 2, Sebastian Jacome 2 tries) defeat Colombia 4 (Norman Lizano try).\nGame 2\nColombia 14 (Miguel Henao Velez, Sebastian Maya Jimenez, Norman Lizano tries; Diego Vejerano goal) defeat Ecuador 8 (Johnny Liszka, Edgar Santamaria tries).\nAggregate: ECUADOR 24 defeat COLOMBIA 18."

The Tamaraws would eventually achieve the first sweep of the tournament (12–0) the following year and were automatically declared champions. The UAAP have seven teams then with the admission of Ateneo in 1978. This was the last finals match-up between FEU and UST until 2015 in Season 78. This was also the year when the UAAP first implemented the twice to beat finals format.\nElimination round.\nTournament format:\nFinals.\nNumber 1 seed FEU only need to win once, while number 2 seed UST need to win twice, to clinch the championship.\nFar Eastern University, with a twice-to-beat advantage and displaying its usual bruising brand, clobbered the University of Santo Tomas Goldies who showed up minus its scoring ace Edgardo Cordero, to clinch the UAAP varsity cage title. Cordero, the 6'4\" scoring leader of the league, was down with flu. The final score, 100–89, clearly showed FEU's mastery of the Goldies.\nAnthony Williams, an ex-US marine who played his finest game in the series, topscored for the winning team with 35 points. And although the usually-unshakable Arturo \"Bai\" Cristobal was limited to 15, FEU's diminutive skipper Danilo Manalastas poured-in 17 to neutralize the combined effort of 63 tallied by UST's Francisco Natividad and Edmund Yee. Natividad finished with 38, 28 of them in the second half, while the high-leaping Yee, who saw little action with Crispa (MICAA) in the last National Seniors, came-up with 25."
