        "text": "The FIDE World Cup 2002, marketed as the Second Chess World Cup, was a 24-player Category XVI chess tournament played between 9 October and 22 October 2002 in Hyderabad, India. The tournament was hosted at Ramoji Film City and organized by FIDE in conjunction with the All India Chess Federation. Former World Cup winner Viswanathan Anand defeated Rustam Kasimdzhanov in the final to retain the title.\nFormat.\nThe tournament began with a league stage, consisting of 4 groups of six players each. Each player played a game against each of the other players in his group once. At the end of the group stage, the top two players from each group progressed to the quarterfinals. In the knockout rounds, each player played a two-game match against his opponent. If the match was tied after the regular games, blitz tie-breaks were used to determine a winner.\nParticipants.\nAll players are Grandmasters unless indicated otherwise.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stages featured a number of surprising upsets, with the top three seeds all struggling to remain in contention. Anand, the No. 1 seed, overcame an early loss to Krishnan Sasikaran with wins over Kasimdzhanov and Al-Modiahki to finish second in his group. Vassily Ivanchuk was less fortunate, dropping games to Malakhov and Macieja and finishing fifth in Group A. Morozevich never recovered after suffering a disastrous start with three straight losses to Ehlvest, Ganguly, and Harikrishna. He scored only one point in five matches, finishing second-to-last in the entire tournament and dropping below 2700 in Elo rating for the first time since 1998.\nPlayoffs.\nFinal.\nIn the final, Viswanathan Anand defended his World Cup title won in Shenyang against Rustam Kasimdzhanov in a two-game match. The first game of the match ended in a 16-move draw, with Kasimdzhanov failing to make any headway against Anand's Caro-Kann defence. In Game 2, Anand gradually outplayed Kasimdzhanov in the Petroff defence, gaining a strong advantage after 18 ... N6g5?. Kasimdzhanov would resign 11 moves later."

        "text": "The FIDE World Cup 2000 was a 24-player Category XVI chess tournament played between 1 September and 13 September 2000 in Shenyang, China. The tournament was organized by FIDE, hosted by the Chinese Chess Association, and billed as the First Chess World Cup. Viswanathan Anand defeated Evgeny Bareev in the final to win the inaugural title and a $50,000 cash prize.\nFormat.\nThe 24 players were split into four groups of six players each, with every player playing each other player in his group once. The top two finishers in each group were sent forward to the knockout stages, with ties being resolved by playoffs. From the quarterfinals onward, each knockout match consisted of two games, with ties being broken by a set of speed games.\nParticipants.\nAll players are Grandmasters unless indicated otherwise.\nGroup stage.\nNine out of the top 10 seeds finished the group stages with a plus or equal score – the lone exception, Alexander Morozevich, crashed out of the tournament with a single point in 5 games. The reigning FIDE World Champion Alexander Khalifman also suffered a disappointing showing, with losses to Anand and Gelfand. The dark horse of the tournament was 19th-seeded Gilberto Milos, a chess grandmaster from Brazil and five-time South American chess champion. Milos' upset win over Morozevich would propel him to the top of Group A, and eventually, into the semifinals of the World Cup. The top seed in each of the other groups advanced to the quarterfinals.\nPlayoffs.\nAnand, the tournament's hitherto-untroubled No. 1 seed, breezed through the quarterfinal round against his longtime rival Vassily Ivanchuk. But Boris Gelfand gave Anand a challenge in the semi-final, and the match was not settled until a sudden-death blitz game. In the other half of the bracket, Bareev dropped the first game but managed to win his quarterfinal match against Azmaiparashvili before facing a relentless Gilberto Milos in the semifinals. Bareev eventually edged past the Brazilian, drawing both classical games before winning the first rapid playoff thanks to a distressing blunder (79. Nd5??) from Milos that cost him his queen and the match.\nFinal.\nThe first game of the World Cup final between Viswanathan Anand and Evgeny Bareev played out to a draw after 33 moves. In the second game, Anand – playing the white side of the French defence – sacrificed the exchange for two pawns to gain a slight advantage. But Bareev's fate was not sealed until 36... Re8?? - a shocking blunder that gave Anand a completely winning position."

        "text": "Indianapolis 500 Evolution is a racing game, developed by British studio Brain in a Jar Ltd, based on the Indianapolis 500 and American Championship car racing from 1961 to 1971. It is similar to Destineer's 2007 game \"Indianapolis 500 Legends\". In the game, players take on the roles of various famous racers from that time period with 21 missions, photos, and movies, as well as competing on courses such as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, as well as the Milwaukee Mile, Trenton, Riverside, Hanford and Langhorne Speedway. Honey Creek, the name for inner road course of the Milwaukee Mile, is also included, and is still used for various club racing events in the present day.\nCareer.\nThe Career lasts between 1961 and 1971 and also features the \"rear-engine revolution\" and the final roadster to race at the Indy 500 in 1968. The game also includes 21 missions that reward the player credits for use in career mode, photos and movies of the Indy 500 between 1961 and 1971.\nIndy 500 events from 1961 to 1971.\n1961 - New Pennock Grandstands and Jack Brabham's Cooper-Climax that finished 9th in the 1961 Indy 500. New rookies such as Roger McCluskey, Bobby Marshman, and Parnelli Jones are introduced.\n1962 - The final strip of bricks left on the start-finish line, qualification speed, and Mickey Thompson's rear-engined Buick racer driven by rookie Dan Gurney.\n1963 - Introduction of the \"rear-engine revolution\" and Team Lotus, Jim Hurtubise driving a Novi-powered car, and Jim Clark's and Dan Gurney's Lotus cars.\n1964 - Decline of the front-engine roadsters begin as the Halibrand, Huffaker, and Brabham cars are introduced to replace the aging roadsters that dominated Indy since 1911.\n1965 - The tragic deaths of Eddie Sachs and Dave McDonald after the 1964 Indy 500 forced the fuel to be changed from gasoline to methanol. The fuel was in fire protective tanks off to the sides of the car with two mandatory pit stops to avoid such a tragic crash. The tanks were smaller in size compared to years previous. Only a handful of front-engine roadsters remains as the rear-engine cars keep dominating the circuit. The fuel change would not happen again in Indy history until 2005 when the fuel was changed to ethanol, which is what the Indy cars run on today.\n1966 - With Bobby Grim remaining as one of the final front-engine roadster drivers, the rear-engine cars also gain a few drivers from Europe such as Jim Clark, Sir Jackie Stewart and Graham Hill from the Formula One series. This also marks the 50th Indy 500 event. \n1967 - Andy Granatelli introduces the STP-Paxton Turbocar, while most of the field remains in rear-engined cars. Even though the turbine-powered car lacked handling, it almost won the 1967 Indy 500 until it broke down with eight miles to go. The problem was caused by a transmission bearing. In 1968, the Turbocar crashed into the wall during qualifying at Indy. Today it is now a museum gem of Indy's two brief years of turbine power. This also marks the first Indy race to not feature a front-engine roadster.\n1968 - Lotus introduces its turbine-powered Lotus 56, while the turbocharged Offenhauser engine is still being used in many Indy rear-engined cars. Jim Hurtubise qualifies a front-engine roadster for the roadster's last time in Indy history.\n1969 - With the turbine-powered cars and front-engined roadsters completely gone, the Indy cars have two choices for engines, both turbocharged: Offenhauser and Ford. However, the Ford engine suffered from high temperatures during racing, qualifying, and practice so most drivers stuck with the turbocharged Offenhauser. Also, the Indy cars now gain aerodynamic enhancements to improve grip and speed.\n1970 - Offenhauser and Ford engines dominate the field while the aerodynamics between the 1961 front-engine roadsters and the 1970 rear-engine cars are also mentioned. qualification speeds also play a big role in the entire Indy 500 field.\n1971 - With all the aerodynamic enhancements to the car, the Coyote is introduced as the first Indy car to handle the four turns at over and straight-line speed at over ."

        "text": "The Lehigh Mountain Hawks women’s basketball team is a college basketball program representing Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Mountain Hawks are a member of NCAA Division I basketball, and compete in the Patriot League. They are coached by Addie Micir, entering her 1st season as head coach. The Mountain Hawks currently play their home games at Stabler Arena.\nHistory.\nLehigh first sponsored a varsity women's basketball team for the 1974–75 season, just a few years after the university became coed. The team competed in the East Coast Conference from 1982–83 through the 1989–90 season. Muffet McGraw coached the team from 1982 to 1987 before becoming the head coach at Notre Dame. Lehigh is a charter member of the Patriot League, which began play in women's basketball in the fall of 1990. As of the end of the 2017–18 season, the Mountain Hawks have an all-time record of 571–599. They have won four conference championships in their history, including an East Coast Conference title in 1986 and three Patriot League titles in 1997, 2009 and 2010. They have made three NCAA Tournament appearances in program history and have lost in the first round all three times, losing 103–35 to Connecticut in 1997, losing 85–49 to Auburn in 2009, and losing 79–42 to Iowa State in 2010.\nHome Arenas.\nThe team originally played its home games exclusively inside Grace Hall on Lehigh's main Asa Packer Campus.

        "title": "Swimming in the United States",
        "text": "Swimming in the United States began competitively in the 1880s. The first nationally recognized swimming organization was the Amateur Athletic Union in 1888.\nHistory.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, public swimming pools became more accessible to the general public.\nUSA Swimming.\nThe Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) was the official organization responsible for the running of all amateur sports in the United States, established in 1888. The AAU was officially charged with the organization and operation of many sports in the US. During this time, swimming was one of the committees in the organization and was not an independent governing body.\nThe Amateur Sports Act of 1978 enabled the governance of sports in the US by organizations other than the AAU. This act made each sport set up its own National governing body (NGB). Each of these governing bodies would be part of the United States Olympic Committee, but would not be run by the committee. Thus, USA Swimming was born. From 1978 to 1980, the official responsibilities of governing the sport were transferred from the AAU Swimming Committee to the new United States Swimming. Bill Lippman, the last head of the Swimming Committee, and Ross Wales, the first president of United States Swimming, worked together to ease the transition. This process was made more complex because the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics and, during this time, the leadership of the sport was in flux.\nInternational competition.\nThe United States is the dominant force in international competitive swimming.\nCollegiate swimming.\nYoung swimmers compete on club teams and may wish to continue their careers through college. Prior to July 1, people can complete recruiting questionnaires for schools they are interested in. The recruiting process for collegiate swimming often starts on 1 July following the athlete's junior year of high school. That date marks the day that college coaches can contact athletes via phone to discuss possibly swimming for their team. After speaking with high school recruits via phone and email, college coaches are able to invite athletes on official recruiting trips, during which the recruits participate in a wide range of activities. Such activities include meeting the team members, attending classes, meetings, and athletic events in order to gain an idea about what it might be like to attend that college. The trips are funded by the athletic department and are known as structured sales pitches designed to impress the student-athlete. Each student-athlete is allowed to take five official recruiting trips, each lasting no longer than 48 hours. Swimmers most often base their college decisions on how well they mesh with the existing team and coaching staff, the location of the school, the academic opportunities, and the cost of attendance.\nStudent-athletes must reach a certain standard of academic performance depending on which college they seek to attend. In some cases, the athletic department may have some control over who is admitted. Once admitted however, academic regulation and policies, such as mandated study hall and credit hours, are strictly enforced. \nSwimmers can choose from competing in Division I, Division II, Division III, or the NAIA. Swimmers that choose to compete in Divisions I through III adhere to the rules set by the NCAA.\nThe collegiate swimming season spans from mid-October to mid-March and ends with the NCAA Championship meet. Meets between two or three teams, known as dual meets or the latter as tri-meets, run throughout the season at collegiate facilities. Conference championships, usually lasting four or five days, include all teams in each conference and are usually held at larger aquatics facilities to accommodate spectators. Collegiate swimmers are eligible to compete in the NCAA championships for Division I, II, and III contingent upon swimmers meeting the qualifying time standards. The qualifying time standard for the NCAA Championships are based on the times that qualified for 16th and 24th place for the meets the previous three years.\nThe NCAA invites 235 male swimmers and 281 female swimmers to the competition each year based on the qualifying standards. There are two qualifying standards, \"A\" and \"B\", where those qualifying with the \"A\" time standard are automatically invited to the championship. Then the next fastest swimmers with the \"B\" time standard are invited to keep each of the events even. This process is repeated until all of invite spots are filled.\nThe NCAA qualifying times varies across the different Divisions. The qualifying standards for the NCAA Championship meet can be found on the NCAA championships site.\nEthnic minorities.\nBlack people in the United States are less likely to be able to swim or swim regularly. This is partly due to aftereffects of segregation, during which access to swimming places for black people was limited due to racism.\nSimone Manuel was the first African American woman to win a gold medal in Olympic swimming."

It follows the lives of a group of women who have all been somehow romantically linked to professional basketball players.\nIt was executively produced by Pam Healey, Sean Rankine, Amanda Scott, Shaunie O'Neal, Mark Seliga, and Lisa Shannon.\nProduction.\n\"Basketball Wives LA\" was revealed on June 20, 2011, with Kimsha Artest, Gloria Govan, Laura Govan, Jackie Christie and Imani Showalter as the cast. Malaysia Pargo and Draya Michele were announced as part of the cast in the series' July 2011 press release. Kimsha Artest stopped showing up for filming because she did not agree with the \"shenanigans and drama\", which explains why she was not featured in more than one episode. Tanya Williams was to be the eighth official \"wife\" but left the series after two episodes. The series premiered on August 29, 2011, to 1.81 million viewers.\nThe third season of \"Basketball Wives LA\" was aired on February 17, 2014. Creator of the series, Shaunie O'Neal, announced that the series would be receiving a major update for the third season. Filming began in August 2013, with new members added to the mix. Gloria Govan Barnes and her sister Laura Govan confirmed their exit with their own series possibly in the works. Brooke Bailey confirmed via Twitter that she would also not return. British Williams, Brandi Maxiell, and Sundy Carter joined the cast. The third-season premiere acquired 1.95 million viewers making it the highest rated premiere for the LA franchise and a 1.0 in the adults 18–49 rating demographic. This season is also the first and only of the series to reach over 2 million viewers for six consecutive weeks\nEpisodes.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "Field hockey in the United States is a sport which has only limited popular support. In the US the sport used to be female dominated as opposed to Europe's male dominant leagues. However, in the United States of America, there are few field hockey clubs, most play taking place between high school or college sides, almost entirely of females. The strength of college field hockey reflects the impact of Title IX which mandated that colleges should fund men's and women's sports programmes comparably. Pennsylvania is a hotbed for field hockey in the United States.\nHistory.\nThe modern game of field hockey originated in Europe, and grew due to the growth of public schools. Springfield College started playing the game when Dr. James Huff McCurdy composed a set of rules for American Field Hockey, and it continued to grow.\nConstance Applebee founded the United States Field Hockey Association (USFHA), after noticing a growing popularity in the sport. The Field Hockey Association of America (FHAA) was created six years later to govern men's field hockey in the United States. The USFHA and FHAA combined April 1993, and the United States Field Hockey Association emerged. The name eventually changed to USA Field Hockey, as we know it today.\nThe game consists of 11 players, with two opposing teams. Curved sticks are used to move a ball across a 100 yard field, with the objective of scoring goals. It can be played both outdoors and indoors, with slightly different rules for each.\nNational board.\nIn the United States, it is called Field Hockey to distinguish it from Ice Hockey. It did not have serious competition until the 1970s. The first Women's World Cup took place in 1974 and women first competed in Olympic hockey in 1980.\nThe training base for the women's national team used to be Chula Vista, California and was relocated to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\nNational team.\nUSA Field Hockey women's team has competed in the Olympics in 1984, 1988, 1996, 2008, 2012, and 2016. The 1984 Olympics the women's team made their first appearance, and earned bronze. At the 2016 Olympics, Team USA closely lost to Germany in the quarterfinals.\nOne high scoring member of the USA team is Kathleen Sharkey, who attended Princeton University. She managed to lead Division 1 field hockey with most goals scored from 2010 to 2012. She was named two time Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year. The men's national team has achieved limited success in international tournaments in comparison to their female counterparts."

Wilkinson in 1928, who had previously worked for A. W. Tillinghast's firm, and was subsequently renovated by Robert Trent Jones in 1949; Alfred Tull in 1953; Stephen Kay in 1998 and Rees Jones in 2013. A new bar, restaurant, reception facilities, and clubhouse were built as part of an extensive remodeling to the course in 2013. \nThe New Jersey State Golf Association moved its headquarters to the club in recent years.\nIn 2016, it became the first New Jersey State Open held on a public course in 95 years. It offers golf lessons and various year-round state-of-the-art golf training facilities including a 9 hole practice course, 52 driving stalls (20 with heat and protection from elements), 46,000 square feet of chipping/putting practice areas, and practice bunkers.\nAccording to the Federal Writers' Project's WPA Guide (1939), \"the club occupies the low, rounded peak of Galloping Hill, so named because of the British military dispatch riders who galloped on the road here [during the American Revolutionary War, which was] an unusual sight for farmers who walked their horses on the steep hill.\"\nThe ghost of a headless Hessian horseman is said to roam the links. At least one ghosthunter has suggested that stories of the Galloping Hill Headless Horseman may have inspired Washington Irving to write \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" (1820).\nRail trail at Galloping Hill.\nArea residents have proposed a 7.3-mile pedestrian linear park along the main line of the abandoned Rahway Valley Railroad. The rail trail would run eastbound from the medical center on the edge of downtown Summit and head south along the old railbed through Springfield, Union, Kenilworth and ending at the southwest edge of Roselle Park at the Cranford border. A northern portion of the rail trail on the RVRR main line is under construction as the Summit Park Line, with a footbridge over Morris Avenue installed in October 2022. In parallel, advocates have been pushing for immediate development of the portion south of Route 22, running past the golf course, with views of same, through Kenilworth and Roselle Park. The New Jersey Department of Transportation, which owns the railbed, has been working to clear it in anticipation of possible future trail use."

        "title": "Handball goalkeeper",
        "text": "The handball goalkeeper is the most defensive player of their team. Their main task is to prevent the other team from scoring a goal.\nEquipment.\nTo avoid confusion, a handball goalkeeper has to wear a jersey that is different in colour to all the other jerseys of the players on the field, including the other team's goalkeeper. If such a jersey is not available the goalkeeper has to wear a bib that guarantees sufficient distinction between players involved. Most goalkeepers also wear special long trousers and male goalkeepers always wear a jockstrap (an undergarment serving protection purposes). Rule 4:9 (concerning equipment during the game) states that it is mandatory for the players to wear sports shoes during the games. Unlike in football, handball goalkeepers do not equip with gloves. Additional protective gear like face masks and helmets had been discussed in the early days of the game, but are nowadays prohibited, as are any items that could endanger the opposing players including piercings, necklaces, earrings and glasses.\nRules for the goalkeeper.\nAll rules can be found on the IHF website.\nA team has to appoint one player on the field as the goalie. However, a goalie can transition to a field player at any time during a game. In order to do this they need to be substituted and change their goalie jersey to a field player's jersey. A field player can assume the goalkeeper's position in the same manner. Rule 5 \"The Goalkeeper\" deals with all the rules pertaining to the goalie and a set of special rules about the goal area. Inside this area the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball with every part of their body in order to parry the ball. Additionally, several rules do not apply to the goalie inside the goal area. These rules are: the 3-second-rule (7:2), the 3-step-rule (7:3), the rule for bouncing the ball (7:4) and the multiple-touching-of-the-ball-rule (7:7). However, if the goalie purposefully delays playing the ball a referee can call passive gameplay.\nThe goalie is allowed to step out of the goal area and onto the playing field when not in possession of the ball at all times. While outside the goal area all rules pertaining to field players apply to them as well. Furthermore, they are allowed to step out of the goal area with the ball while he is still trying to get it under control (5:4). The goalkeeper is not allowed to leave the goal area with the ball under control if the referee has whistled for the execution of a goalkeeper-throw (5:6). This throw has to be executed within the goal area. Rule 5:7+8 stipulate that while standing inside the goal area the goalkeeper is not allowed to touch a rolling or stationary ball outside the goal area. Moreover, they are not allowed to re-enter the goal area from the playing field with the ball (5:9). The goalie must not touch the ball with his foot or the leg below the knee if the ball is moving out towards the playing area (5:10). During a 7-metre throw from the opposing team the goalkeeper is not allowed to cross the goalkeeper's restraining line (4-metre-line) before the ball has left the hand of the opposing player executing the throw (5.11).\nIf the ball crosses the outer goal line outside the goalposts and the goalkeeper was the last player to touch the ball, the keeper gets the ball to execute a goalkeeper-throw inside the goal area. However, if the ball crosses the sideline the opposing team gets the ball for a throw-in.\nSometimes the goalkeeper will be used as a seventh field player or substituted by a regular field player. This normally happens during the last minutes of play if the score is a tie or the attacking team is down by just a few points. The extra player is added to increase the team's chances for a win or a tie.\nDuties and requirements of a handball goalkeeper.\nThe goalkeeper's primary task is to prevent the other team from scoring a goal, which is achieved when the ball fully passes the goal line. The game has become much more fast-paced over the years which demands that the goalkeeper has to bring the ball back into play very fast, leading to fast breaks or turnovers which provide very good scoring chances. Strategies like the second wave or the so-called \"schnelle Mitte,\" are fast-action plays intended to catch the opposing team off guard. After having conceded a goal the keeper passes the ball immediately to the centre of the court for a throw-off. In some situation the goalkeeper even scores a goal himself by taking advantage of the fact that the other team's goalie is too far away from his own goal and throwing the ball across the whole field into the empty goal. The German goalkeeper Johannes Bitter managed to score two goals in that manner over the course of his 112 international games.\nHeight is an important criterion for goalkeepers who want to play on a professional level. The rule of thumb in this regard is \"the bigger the better\". Dieter Bartke, a former goalkeeper of the German national league, was tall. Disadvantages in height are effectively compensated by other factors, like jumping power and flexibility of the body. Prominent examples are Wieland Schmidt ( tall) and Henning Fritz (). Skills such as quick reflexes, quick comprehension and a distinct anticipation ability are considered more important than height. Modern handball training is focused on improving a goalkeeper's anticipation of typical in-game situations by implementing the so-called standard situation, a concept that simulates a set of the most common scenarios that can happen in a game. Sports scientists coined the phrase \"Aktionsmuster,\" action patterns, which goalkeepers try to embed in their subconsciousness.\nCommon goalkeeper injuries.\nProblems in the elbow area are most common among handball goalies. In 1992 a study conducted in Norway reported that 329 out of 729 (45%) handball goalkeepers suffered from pain in the elbow joint area. In contrast to these numbers only 166 out of 4120 (4%) field players complained about similar problems. In a follow-up survey out of these 729 goalkeepers 41% had acute problems and 34% reported past problems in the area. The health problem caused recurring pain and often the goalkeepers had to stop playing for several games due to injury. The apparent cause for these injuries is a repeated overextension of the elbow joint while trying to parry a ball. The authors of the study call the syndrome the \"handball goalie's elbow.\" This hyperextension trauma of the elbow can also frequently occur during joint-lock techniques in judo.\nThe cause for this type of pain is most probably damage to the ulnar nerve. A definite diagnosis is the main focus of current studies in order to develop sufficient prevention and treatment methods.\nFurther remarks.\nIf a goalkeeper receives a two-minute suspension he has to leave the field and is replaced by another goalkeeper, usually forcing his team to continue playing with one player less on the field. It has been under discussion for several years whether goalkeepers should be forbidden to step outside the goal area during fast breaks, a rule which has caused a lot of accidents between the goalie and field players.\nIf both teams have similar performance during a game, the goalkeeper's individual performance can have a huge impact on the outcome of the game. A ratio of 25 per cent saves and more is regarded a very good performance with 50 per cent saves very rarely being achieved over a time period of thirty minutes.\nThe jumping jack is a typical goalkeeper's defensive movement while trying to save the ball.\nWhen a player's throw hits the goalkeeper's head, for example, from a seven-meter throw, the player will be disqualified (rule 8:5).\nNotable goalkeepers.\nAmong the best male goalkeeper, one can mention (in alphabetical order)\nAmong the best female goalkeeper, one can mention (in alphabetical order)"

        "text": "Don Beck (born June 2, 1953) is an American professional basketball coach.\nCareer.\nA 1975 Quinnipiac University graduate, Beck began his career on the sideline as assistant coach at Santa Barbara City College in 1978, before taking his first head coach position at Santa Barbara City College in 1979, where he coached the women's team during the 1979-80 season. Other assistant coach stints came at Bentley College (1981-85), Rutgers University (1985-86) and Fresno State University (1986-90).

        "title": "Bowling Green massacre",
        "text": "The Bowling Green massacre is a fictitious incident of Islamic terrorism mentioned by Kellyanne Conway, then–counselor to President Donald Trump, in interviews with \"Cosmopolitan\" and TMZ on January 29, 2017, and in an interview on the MSNBC news program \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\" on February 2, 2017. Conway cited it as justification for a travel and immigration ban from seven Muslim-majority countries enacted by United States president Donald Trump. However, no such massacre occurred. The day after the interview, Conway said she misspoke and had been referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on charges including \"attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to al-Qaeda in Iraq.\" She stated that she had mentioned the incident because it led previous President Barack Obama to tighten immigration procedures for Iraqi citizens.\nHer false statement went viral and became the top trending topic on Twitter, with many tweets parodying it. A website was set up anonymously for the purpose of collecting donations for supposed victims. Facebook users used the site's safety check feature to act as if the event were real. Mock vigils were held in Kentucky and New York in commemoration. It provoked widespread press reaction, with many relating it to Conway's earlier use of the phrase \"alternative facts\" to describe false statements by White House press secretary Sean Spicer in the wake of Trump's inauguration.\nBackground.\nTerrorism-related arrests.\nIn 2011, two Iraqi men who had entered the country as refugees were arrested in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on federal terrorism charges after they attempted to send both money and weapons to al-Qaeda in Iraq. Both were convicted of supporting attacks on the U.S. military while they were still in Iraq as well as attempting to provide material support to al-Qaeda in Iraq after they emigrated to the United States. Arrests were made on various charges, including \"attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to al Qaeda in Iraq\".\nBefore entering the U.S., both had used improvised explosive devices in Iraq, although this was not known at the time of their admission. Both pleaded guilty; one is serving a life sentence while the other is serving 40 years in federal prison. The two did not attack anyone in the U.S., and there was no evidence that the men traveled back to Iraq or had any contact with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant after being admitted to the U.S. Neither was charged with plotting attacks inside the United States.\nIn response to the arrests, the administration of Barack Obama re-vetted 58,000 refugees already in the country, imposed vetting on 25,000 other Iraqi citizens still in Iraq, and significantly tightened the processing of Iraqi visa and refugee applications for six months. Obama also instituted a requirement for new background checks on visa applicants from Iraq; as a result, Iraq travel visas were issued more slowly. The changes in visa verification were temporary, and some Iraqi refugees continued to be admitted to the United States throughout the period.\nSimilar possible misstatements.\nIn September 2014, on \"Fox News Sunday\", U.S. Representative Peter King of New York referred to the 2011 arrest of Iraqi nationals in Kentucky as an attempt to \"attack either Fort Campbell or Fort Knox\". The fact-checking site PolitiFact.com, which evaluated the statement as being false, found that he had said something similar at least seven times previously.\nOn January 29–30, 2017, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated that Islamist terrorists perpetrated a terrorist attack in Atlanta, even though Atlanta has never had a terrorist attack carried out by Islamists. The initial comment was made on ABC's \"This Week\", and then Spicer repeated the claim on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" the following day. Spicer later said that he meant Orlando, referring to the mass shooting carried out by U.S.-born Omar Mateen. There have been two terrorist attacks in Atlanta: the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing, which was committed by domestic terrorist Eric Rudolph, and the 1958 Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple bombing.\nA day later, on January 31, two days before the \"Hardball\" interview with Conway, Kentucky senator Rand Paul referenced the 2011 case in an interview with MSNBC by mentioning \"the possibility or the attempted bombing in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where I live\". \"The Washington Post\"s Fact Checker noted that Paul's statement was truer than Conway's because the Iraqi nationals did discuss bombing an Army target in the United States, even though neither was charged with making actual plans to do so.\nFalse statements by Conway.\nOn January 29, 2017, in an interview with \"Cosmopolitan\", Conway said that Obama had limited Iraqi immigration because \"two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills, and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers' lives away\".\nOn the same day, in a brief interview with TMZ, Conway stated: \"He did that because, I assume, there were two Iraqis who came here, got radicalized, joined ISIS, and then were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green attack on our brave soldiers.\"\nThree days later, on February 2, in an interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC's \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\", Conway described the \"Bowling Green massacre\" as an attack of terrorism carried out within the United States by refugees. Conway said:\nAlthough the interviews with \"Cosmopolitan\" and TMZ were conducted first, they did not become public until after the MSNBC interview aired.\nAftermath.\nOn February 3, the day after her MSNBC interview, Conway said she misspoke and that she meant to use the term \"Bowling Green terrorists\" instead of \"Bowling Green massacre\", referring to the two Iraqi men arrested in 2011. \"The Washington Post\" subsequently mentioned previous statements by Conway in which she had made reference to the nonexistent massacre, indicating that \"now she doesn't appear to have misspoken at all; she seems to have believed that the Bowling Green massacre was a real thing.\"\nConway's statement that the men became \"radicalized\" in the United States was found to be incorrect, as they had been radicalized outside of the country. Conway's statement that President Obama \"had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program\" was misleading, as the Obama administration move was not a formal ban. Contrary to Conway's claims, there is no evidence that the men had traveled back to the Middle East or had any contact with ISIS after being admitted to the United States. Neither of the two was ever charged with plotting attacks inside the United States.\nConway, in her February 3 statement, said that there was no coverage of the Bowling Green investigation, which she intended to refer to. However, there were approximately 90 news articles that covered the arrest and charges at the time. Conway's February 3 statement cited an example of that coverage, without acknowledging that her claim that \"it didn't get covered\" was also incorrect.\nOn February 5, CNN declined an interview with Conway, partly because of \"serious questions about her credibility\" and partly because CNN could not get Mike Pence, whom the administration made available to all the other major Sunday shows. That day, she said in a text exchange, \"Frankly they were terrorists in Bowling Green but their massacre took place in Iraq.\" Two days later, she was a guest on CNN, interviewed on air by Jake Tapper. In the interview, Conway apologized for repeatedly referencing a \"Bowling Green massacre\" that did not happen.\nIn a March 2017 interview with \"New York\", Conway said she intended to say \"Bowling Green masterminds\" rather than \"Bowling Green massacre\", in reference to \"would-be terrorists who were apprehended before they staged an attack\".\nReactions.\nThe video clip of Conway's \"massacre\" statement went viral online, with the phrase becoming the top trending topic on Twitter. Some Twitter users wrote that, despite Conway's clarification, substituting \"terrorists\" for \"massacre\" in her statement did not make sense. Her statement was parodied on Twitter and other platforms with people creating fake tributes. A website was set up anonymously for the purpose of collecting donations for victims of the imaginary massacre; the donation link on the website goes to the ACLU's donation page. Facebook users mocked the Bowling Green massacre by using Facebook's safety check feature to pretend the event was real. In New York City's Bowling Green, people held a mock vigil to commemorate the \"victims\" of the \"massacre\". Another mock vigil took place on February 3, 2017, in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Responses on the Donald Trump-centric subreddit /r/The_Donald were \"varied – and rather muted\", with some redditors speculating that it was an intentional part of a larger strategy by the Trump administration.\nSamantha Schmidt wrote in \"The Washington Post\": \"Conway has taken 'alternative facts' to a new level\". \"The Atlantic\" wrote that her \"false statement stands out because it is simultaneously inaccurate and has the potential to be extremely inflammatory\". Brian Stelter on CNN criticized the Trump administration for \"hammering\" the media for mistakes but going easy on Conway's error. British journalist Marina Hyde wrote a column in \"The Guardian\" criticizing the Trump administration for creating a fictional massacre when it was silent on the Quebec City mosque shooting. UK talk show \"The Last Leg's\" Alex Brooker commented: \"Are there so few shootings in America that they're having to make them up?\" \"Cosmopolitan\" reporter Kristen Mascia said: \"It didn't surprise me that the comment was premeditated and that she'd tried it on multiple writers (who knows who else she auditioned it with, frankly). But others out there may not know this about her, and they should. We must call out the [White House] for stuff like this because it's egregious and totally unacceptable.\" After Chelsea Clinton posted a tweet that stated, in part: \"Please don't make up attacks\", Conway replied: \"Bosnia lie a Great reminder\", referring to how Clinton's mother Hillary Clinton falsely claimed to have landed in Bosnia \"under sniper fire\" during the Bosnian War.\nWriting in \"The New York Times\", A. C. Thompson mentioned the 2012 case of a man who the authorities suspected of trafficking in counterfeit goods. His home and his store in Bowling Green, Ohio, were raided, and 18 firearms were found in his possession. Federal authorities believed that he was planning on killing African Americans and Jews. The man, who the prosecutors called a white supremacist, pleaded guilty to weapons and counterfeit charges, but prosecutors failed to establish that he was a political terrorist.\nThe mayor of Bowling Green, Kentucky, issued a statement clarifying that \"there was no massacre in Bowling Green\", adding that he understood \"how during a live interview one can misspeak and we appreciate the clarification\".\nConway's statement was parodied in two segments of season 42 of \"Saturday Night Live\". In the cold open for that season's episode 13, Alec Baldwin, playing the role of Donald Trump, said that in the Bowling Green massacre, \"[s]o many people died, but really they're the lucky ones. They don't have to see how bad \"The Apprentice\" has gotten\". In episode 14's cold open, Melissa McCarthy, playing the role of Sean Spicer, recited a list of terrorist incidents that \"you [the news media] never even write about\", referencing a list of 78 supposedly under-reported terrorist incidents that the White House had released earlier that week. McCarthy, as Spicer, said: \"The Bowling Green massacre—not the Kellyanne one, the real one. The Horror in Six Flags. The Slaughter at Fraggle Rock. The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down. Okay?!\""

        "title": "2019 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2019 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League, the 64th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA and the 27th season since it was rebranded the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, Spain on 1 June 2019, between English sides Tottenham Hotspur (in their first European Cup final) and Liverpool (in their ninth overall and their second in a row, having been defeated by Real Madrid in 2018). It was the seventh Champions League final – and the fourth of the decade – to feature two teams from the same association, and the second all-English final (the first was in 2008). It was also the first final since 2013 to not feature at least one Spanish team, with Real Madrid and Barcelona having shared the previous five titles between them.\nLiverpool won the final 2–0, with a penalty which was scored after 106 seconds by Mohamed Salah, and a goal by substitute Divock Origi after 87 minutes. As winners, for the sixth time in their history, Liverpool earned the right to play in the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup, as well as against Chelsea, the winners of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League, in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup, winning in both competitions. They also secured qualification for the group stage of the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League. As Liverpool had already qualified through their league position, the reserved berth was given to Red Bull Salzburg, the champions of the 2018–19 Austrian Bundesliga, the 11th-ranked association according to next season's access list.\nIn March 2018, UEFA announced that a fourth substitution would be allowed in extra time and that the number of substitutes would be increased from 7 to 12. The kick-off time was also changed from 20:45 CEST to 21:00 CEST. The match was also the first Champions League final to use the video assistant referee (VAR) system.\nTeams.\n\"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\"\nVenue.\nThis was the fifth European Cup/UEFA Champions League final held in Madrid, after the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 finals, all held at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.\nThe 67,000-seat Metropolitano Stadium is the home of Atlético Madrid, who have occupied it since major renovations were completed in September 2017. Due to UEFA regulations regarding naming rights of non-tournament sponsors, the stadium was referred to as the \"Estadio Metropolitano\" in all UEFA materials.\nHost selection.\nFor the first time, UEFA launched an open bidding process to select the venues of the club competition finals (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Women's Champions League and UEFA Super Cup). The bidding process was opened on 9 December 2016 and associations were given until 27 January 2017 to express interest and 6 June 2017 to submit bid dossiers to UEFA.\nUEFA announced on 3 February 2017 that the associations of Azerbaijan and Spain had expressed interest in hosting the Champions League final. On 7 June 2017, UEFA confirmed that they submitted bids for the 2019 UEFA Champions League final, with Azerbaijan proposing the 68,700-seat Baku Olympic Stadium and Spain proposing the then-unfinished Wanda Metropolitano, which would hold 67,000 spectators. The bid evaluation report was published by UEFA on 14 September 2017. The Wanda Metropolitano was selected as the venue by the UEFA Executive Committee on 20 September 2017, while the Baku Olympic Stadium was successful in its bid to host the 2019 UEFA Europa League Final.\nBackground.\nTottenham Hotspur reached their first ever Champions League final, becoming the eighth unique finalist from England and the fortieth overall. They were the first final debutants since fellow English and London club Chelsea in 2008. It was the fifth time they had appeared in the final of a UEFA competition, having played in one Cup Winners' Cup final (winning in 1963 to become the first British team to win a European trophy) and three UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1972 and 1984 and losing in 1974). Had they won the final, they would have become the third English club, as well as the sixth club overall, to have won all three pre-1999 major European trophies (European Cup/Champions League, UEFA Cup/Europa League and the now-defunct Cup Winners' Cup).\nIn eight matches, they had a record of four wins, one draw and three losses in European competitions against fellow English clubs. Of the four ties, Tottenham won two: against Manchester City in this season's quarter-finals, and against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the 1972 UEFA Cup Final, the inaugural final of the competition, becoming the first British team to win two different European trophies.\nLiverpool reached their ninth overall final, an English record, as well as their second in a row, having lost to Real Madrid in 2018. They had won the competition on five occasions (1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005) and lost three times (1985, 2007 and 2018). This was also their 14th final in UEFA competitions, having played in one Cup Winners' Cup final (losing in 1966) and four UEFA Cup/Europa League finals (winning in 1973, 1976 and 2001, and losing in 2016). In twenty matches, Liverpool had a record of seven wins, eight draws (one of which they won on penalties) and five losses in European competitions against fellow English clubs. Most recently, they won both legs against Manchester City in the 2017–18 Champions League quarter-finals. The match was the third Champions League final for manager Jürgen Klopp, who had lost both previous finals, with Borussia Dortmund in 2013 and with Liverpool in 2018.\nThe final was the 171st competitive meeting between Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, with a record of 79 Liverpool wins, 48 Tottenham wins and 43 draws. The sides met twice during the 2018–19 Premier League season, with Liverpool winning 2–1 on both occasions, played at Wembley Stadium and Anfield respectively. They had faced each other once before in a European tie, meeting in the semi-final of the 1972–73 UEFA Cup; Liverpool won the first leg 1–0 at home and Tottenham won the second meeting 2–1, though Liverpool advanced to the final on away goals, before beating Borussia Mönchengladbach in the final. Domestically, the sides had met once in a cup final, with Liverpool winning 3–1 after extra time in the 1982 Football League Cup Final. Both managers were seeking their first major title with their respective clubs.\nThe match was the first final since 2013 not to feature a Spanish team, with Real Madrid (2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018) and Barcelona (2015) having won the previous five seasons of the competition. It was also the first final to be won by an English team since Chelsea in 2012, as well as the second all-English final, after Manchester United and Chelsea in 2008. Overall, the match was the seventh final to feature two teams from the same association, previously achieved on three occasions by Spanish teams (2000, 2014 and 2016), and once by Italian (2003) and German (2013) teams, in addition to English in 2008.\nAs Chelsea and Arsenal also reached the 2019 UEFA Europa League Final, this was the first season to have multiple finals of major European club competitions featuring teams from a single nation.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nTottenham Hotspur.\nTottenham Hotspur, making their first appearance in a European competition final since 1984 and their first ever in the European Cup final, qualified directly for the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League group stage as the third-placed team in the 2017–18 Premier League. They were drawn into Group B alongside Spanish champions Barcelona, Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven and Inter Milan of Italy, all of whom are former European champions.\nSpurs began their Champions League campaign at the San Siro in Milan, where they lost 2–1 to Inter after conceding twice in the final minutes of the match. At Wembley Stadium in London, the club's temporary home, Tottenham lost 4–2 to Barcelona and fell to third place in Group B. Spurs drew 2–2 with PSV Eindhoven on matchday 3, played in the Netherlands, but lost goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to a red card and conceded a late equalising goal to Luuk de Jong in the 87th minute. Tottenham conceded early to PSV in the home leg at Wembley, but two goals from Harry Kane late in the second half gave the team their first Champions League win of the season. Against Inter at Wembley, substitute Christian Eriksen's 80th-minute goal gave Spurs a 1–0 victory and prevented the club from being eliminated. The final group stage match against Barcelona at Camp Nou began with an early goal for the home side, but a late equaliser by Lucas Moura preserved a 1–1 draw for Tottenham. The team finished level on points with Inter, but advanced to the knockout stage on head-to-head away goals as group runners-up to Barcelona.\nTottenham faced German club Borussia Dortmund in the round of 16, marking the second time in three years that the two teams had met in a European competition. Spurs won 3–0 with a dominant performance in the first leg at home, highlighted by second-half goals from Son Heung-min, Jan Vertonghen and Fernando Llorente. The second leg at the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund ended as a 1–0 win for the visitors, with a goal by Harry Kane early in the second half bringing the tie to 4–0 on aggregate and sending Tottenham to the quarter-finals.\nThe club was drawn in the quarter-finals against their compatriots and reigning English champions Manchester City, with two legs scheduled within 11 days of a Premier League fixture between the clubs. Tottenham hosted the first leg, the first European tie at the newly-completed Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and won 1–0 thanks to a goal scored by Son Heung-min in the 78th minute, following an earlier penalty from City's Sergio Agüero in the first half that was saved by Hugo Lloris. Manchester City took an early 3–2 lead within 21 minutes to open the second leg, including two goals apiece for Son and City's Raheem Sterling and an additional goal scored by Bernardo Silva. Agüero's goal in the 59th minute gave Manchester City a 4–3 lead on aggregate in the series, but Fernando Llorente scored in the 73rd minute to tie the series once again and give Tottenham an advantage on away goals. Sterling scored a fifth goal for City in the third minute of stoppage time, but it was ruled out by the video assistant referee for an offside during the buildup to the goal, giving Tottenham a victory on away goals to send them to their first European Cup semi-final since 1962.\nIn the semi-finals, Tottenham faced Dutch club Ajax, who had won the European Cup four times. A resurgent Ajax had entered the competition through the qualifying rounds with a young squad and went on to eliminate reigning holders Real Madrid in the round of 16 and Juventus in the quarter-finals. Spurs, missing forwards Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, among others, to injuries, lost 1–0 in the first leg at home, Ajax's lone goal coming in the 15th minute from Donny van de Beek. Ajax began the second leg at their Johan Cruyff Arena with goals from Matthijs de Ligt and Hakim Ziyech to extend their aggregate lead to 3–0 at half-time. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino substituted defensive midfielder Victor Wanyama for striker Fernando Llorente at half-time, and his strike partner, Lucas Moura, scored the team's first goal of the semi-final in the 55th minute. Moura then scored a second goal five minutes later, his tight footwork helping him beat several Ajax players after an initial save by goalkeeper André Onana. After Tottenham failed to convert several chances to level the tie, the match entered five minutes of stoppage time. As the clock passed the five-minute mark, Moura completed his hat-trick with a first-time shot from just inside the penalty area to make the score 3–3 on aggregate and put Spurs through to the final on away goals. The second leg was hailed as one of the greatest comebacks in Champions League history, alongside Liverpool's semi-final played the day before.\nLiverpool.\nLiverpool, the runners-up in the previous year's final, qualified directly for the group stage as the fourth-placed team in the Premier League. They were drawn into Group C alongside French champions Paris Saint-Germain, Napoli of Italy and Serbian champions Red Star Belgrade, who qualified through the play-off round and were making their Champions League group stage debut.\nIn the opening match of the group stage, Liverpool faced Paris Saint-Germain at Anfield and won 3–2 with a goal in stoppage time by substitute Roberto Firmino. Liverpool failed to produce a shot on target during their 1–0 loss to Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on matchday 2, which the home side won with a 90th-minute goal from Lorenzo Insigne. Liverpool retook their position at the top of Group C following a 4–0 home victory over Red Star Belgrade on 24 October, including a brace from Mohamed Salah, but suffered a shock 2–0 defeat to Red Star two weeks later in Belgrade and fell to second place behind Napoli.\nAt the Parc des Princes in Paris, Liverpool were defeated 2–1 by Paris Saint-Germain and fell to third place in the group, putting them in jeopardy of a group stage elimination. Liverpool won their final group stage match, played on 11 December against Napoli at Anfield, with Salah scoring the only goal of the game. Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson saved Arkadiusz Milik's shot from eight yards out deep into second half injury time to preserve a clean sheet. Liverpool remained tied with Napoli on points, head-to-head record and goal difference but advanced to the knockout phase on total goals scored, with nine goals to Napoli's seven.\nLiverpool were matched against German champions Bayern Munich in the round of 16 and played to a scoreless draw in the first leg at Anfield, mirroring the two sides' semi-final tie in the 1980–81 European Cup. They advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating Bayern 3–1 in the second leg at the Allianz Arena, with two goals from Sadio Mané and one from Virgil van Dijk in the second half. Liverpool won their quarter-final tie against Portuguese club Porto with an aggregate score of 6–1, winning 2–0 in the first leg at home and 4–1 away at the Estádio do Dragão.\nIn the semi-finals, Liverpool faced tournament favourites Barcelona. Former Liverpool forwards Luis Suárez and Philippe Coutinho were playing against their old club for the first time competitively since being sold to Barça for record transfer fees in 2014 and 2018, respectively. Barcelona took advantage of several missed chances from Liverpool's strikers and won 3–0 at home, with two second-half goals by Lionel Messi, including a free kick in the 82nd minute, his 600th goal for the club. With a three-goal deficit going into the second leg and preoccupation with the Premier League title race, Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp asked his players to \"just try\" or \"fail in the most beautiful way\". Despite Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino being absent with injuries, Liverpool overturned the deficit with a 4–0 win at Anfield, advancing to the final 4–3 on aggregate, in what was described as one of the greatest comebacks in Champions League history. Liverpool's reserve striker Divock Origi scored the opening goal in the seventh minute, followed by a pair of goals in quick succession by half-time substitute Georginio Wijnaldum to level the tie on aggregate in the 56th minute. Alisson made a series of key saves to deny Barcelona a valuable away goal, a repeat of his performance for Roma in the previous year's quarter-final as they overcame a three-goal deficit against Barcelona. Origi scored the match's final goal in the 79th minute, taking advantage of a corner taken quickly from Trent Alexander-Arnold that left him unmarked in the penalty area.\nPre-match.\nFinal identity.\nThe final identity to be used in the final was unveiled on 30 August 2018 during the group stage draw. It was designed by Madrid-based artist Ruben Sanchez (Zoonchez) who drew inspiration from local folklore, including representations of the city emblem, cats (a nickname for Madrilenians), a guitar and a statue in Puerta del Sol. The colour palette includes blues and oranges that represent a type of Madrid sunset that is known as a \"candilazo\".\nAmbassador.\nThe ambassador for the final was former Spain international Luis García, who played for Atlético Madrid in 2002–03 and from 2007 to 2009, and won the UEFA Champions League with Liverpool in 2005.\nTicketing.\nWith a stadium capacity of 63,500 for the final, a total of 38,000 tickets were available to fans and the general public; the two finalist teams received 17,000 tickets each and another 4,000 tickets were made available for purchase by fans worldwide via \"UEFA.com\" from 14 to 21 March 2019 in four price categories: €600, €450, €160 and €70. The remaining tickets were allocated to the local organising committee, UEFA and national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters, and to serve the corporate hospitality programme.\nPrices for accommodation in Madrid and flights to the city from English airports surged by up to 683 percent in the hours after the semi-finals. The handling of the travel logistics and ticket pricing by UEFA were criticised by managers Jürgen Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino, as well as supporters groups representing the two clubs. Tottenham announced plans to show a live screening of the Champions League final at their stadium in London that would be opened to a full-capacity audience.\nOpening ceremony.\nAmerican pop rock band Imagine Dragons performed at the opening ceremony before kick-off, playing a medley of their hits \"Believer\", \"Thunder\", \"Radioactive\" and \"On Top of the World\", supported by a display of pyrotechnics and fireworks. Ukrainian electric string quartet Asturia Girls performed the UEFA Champions League Anthem as the teams walked out for the match.\nMatch.\nOfficials.\nOn 14 May 2019, UEFA named Slovenian Damir Skomina as the referee for the final. Skomina became a FIFA referee in 2002, and was previously the fourth official in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. His appointment completed a treble of European finals, having officiated the 2017 UEFA Europa League Final between Ajax and Manchester United, as well as the 2012 UEFA Super Cup between Chelsea and Atlético Madrid. He was joined by two of his fellow countrymen, with Jure Praprotnik and Robert Vukan as assistant referees. Spaniard Antonio Mateu Lahoz was the fourth official and Danny Makkelie of the Netherlands was the video assistant referee in the debut of the system at a Champions League final. He was joined by his compatriot Pol van Boekel as one of the assistant VAR officials, with Felix Zwayer of Germany appointed as the other assistant VAR for the final. His fellow German Mark Borsch served as the offside VAR official.\nSummary.\nPrior to kick-off, a moment of silence was observed for Spanish footballer José Antonio Reyes, who had died in a car crash earlier in the day. Liverpool kicked off and earned a penalty kick just 24 seconds into the match when Moussa Sissoko handled the ball in the penalty area, after a pass by Sadio Mané from the left struck his outstretched arm. The resulting penalty in the second minute was scored by Mohamed Salah shooting to the right, giving Liverpool a 1–0 lead and Salah the second-fastest goal in a Champions League final. Tottenham held the majority of possession in the first half, but were unable to find scoring chances; Liverpool had their own chances from a series of six corner kicks, but played cautiously with their lead. The match was briefly interrupted in the 18th minute by a pitch invader.\nThe second half featured more chances for Liverpool, including a shot by James Milner that beat goalkeeper Hugo Lloris but went wide of the goal. Both managers made their first set of substitutions around the 60th minute, with Klopp bringing on Divock Origi for Roberto Firmino and Pochettino replacing Harry Winks with Lucas Moura. Tottenham began pressing their attackers forward and took several shots on target in the last half-hour of the regular time, leaving themselves open to counterattacks by Liverpool. Following a corner kick in the 87th minute that was not cleared away by Spurs, Divock Origi struck from inside the penalty area and scored into the bottom right corner of the net. Liverpool won their sixth European Cup and Jürgen Klopp won his first trophy for the club.\nDetails.\nThe \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held after the quarter-final and semi-final draws, which was held on 15 March 2019, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nLiverpool won their sixth European Cup and their second of the Champions League era. The club surpassed Barcelona and Bayern Munich, each with five titles, and ranks third behind Real Madrid (13) and Milan (7) for overall European titles. Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk was named the man of the match by UEFA for his leadership and interventions to break up Tottenham's attacks.\nLiverpool returned to England the day after the final and celebrated their victory by parading the trophy around Liverpool in an open-top double-decker bus. The parade began at Allerton Maze and continued for 8 miles (13 kilometres) towards the city centre, ending on the Liverpool Strand. Police estimated the number of supporters to be approximately 750,000, with the number of people lining the route causing the parade to last an additional two hours.\nSubsequent matches.\nAs champions, Liverpool faced Chelsea (winners of the 2019 UEFA Europa League Final) in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup, held on 14 August. Liverpool won the match 5–4 on penalties after the game had ended 2–2 after extra time. Representing Europe, Liverpool also took part in the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup. Liverpool went on to win their first Club World Cup title, defeating Monterrey 2–1 in the semi-finals and Flamengo 1–0 after extra time in the final."

        "text": "The 2018–19 UEFA Champions League was the 64th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 27th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. For the first time, the video assistant referee (VAR) system was used in the competition from the round of 16 onward.\nThe final was played at the Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, Spain, between Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, in the second all-English final after Manchester United beat Chelsea in 2008. Liverpool won the match 2–0 to claim their sixth European Cup – becoming the third ever team to do so, behind Real Madrid in 1966, and Milan in 2003. The win gave Liverpool automatic qualification for the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League group stage and the right to play in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup and the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup, the latter two of which they won. As Chelsea and Arsenal also reached the 2019 UEFA Europa League final, this was the first season to have multiple finals of major European club competitions featuring teams from a single nation.\nReal Madrid, who had won four of the last five titles, including each of the last three, were eliminated by Ajax in the round of 16. Although Ajax was eliminated in the semi-finals, they had played more matches than any other team in the tournament due to entering in the second qualifying round.\nFormat changes.\nOn 9 December 2016, UEFA confirmed the reforming plan for the UEFA Champions League for the 2018–2021 cycle, which was announced on 26 August 2016. As per the new regulations, the previous season's UEFA Europa League winners will qualify automatically for the UEFA Champions League group stage (previously they would qualify for the play-off round, but would be promoted to the group stage only if the Champions League title holder berth was vacated, although this promotion to the group stage had been made in all three seasons since it was established from 2015–2016). Meanwhile, the top four teams from the leagues of the four top-ranked national associations in the UEFA country coefficients list will qualify automatically for the group stage as well. Only six teams will qualify for the group stage via the qualification rounds, down from ten in the previous season.\nThis was also the first year to feature a preliminary round, in which the representatives of the four bottom-ranked national associations in the UEFA country coefficients contested single-legged semi-finals and a final to determine the final team to enter the first qualifying round.\nAssociation team allocation.\n79 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\nAssociation ranking.\nFor the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2017 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2012–13 to 2016–17.\nApart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\nDistribution.\nIn the default access list, the Champions League title holders qualified for the group stage. However, since Real Madrid already qualified for the group stage via their domestic league (as third place of the 2017–18 La Liga), the following changes to the access list were made:\nIn addition, the Europa League title holders qualified for the group stage. However, since Atlético Madrid, the Europa League champions, already qualified for the group stage via their domestic league (as second place of the 2017–18 La Liga), the following changes to the access list were made:\nTeams.\nLeague positions of the previous season shown in parentheses (TH: Champions League title holders; EL: Europa League title holders).\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nFrom this season, there were staggered kick-off times in the group stage at 18:55 CET and 21:00 CET. Kick-off times starting from the knock-out phase were 21:00 CET.\nQualifying rounds.\nIn the qualifying and play-off rounds, teams were divided into seeded and unseeded teams based on their 2018 UEFA club coefficients, and then drawn into two-legged home-and-away ties.\nPreliminary round.\nIn the preliminary round, teams were divided into seeded and unseeded teams based on their 2018 UEFA club coefficients, and then drawn into one-legged semi-final and final ties. The draw for the preliminary round was held on 12 June 2018. The semi-final round was played on 26 June, and the final round was played on 29 June 2018, both at the Victoria Stadium in Gibraltar. The losers of both semi-final and final rounds entered the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League second qualifying round.\nDrita's win on 26 June 2018 was the first time that a team representing Kosovo had won a game in any UEFA competition.\nFirst qualifying round.\nThe draw for the first qualifying round was held on 19 June 2018. The first legs were played on 10 and 11 July, and the second legs were played on 17 and 18 July 2018. The losers entered the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League second qualifying round, except one team were drawn to receive a bye to the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round.\nSecond qualifying round.\nThe second qualifying round was split into two separate sections: Champions Path (for league champions) and League Path (for league non-champions). The draw for the second qualifying round was held on 19 June 2018. The first legs were played on 24 and 25 July, and the second legs were played on 31 July and 1 August 2018. The losers from both Champions Path and League Path entered the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round.\nThird qualifying round.\nThe third qualifying round was split into two separate sections: Champions Path (for league champions) and League Path (for league non-champions). The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 23 July 2018. The first legs were played on 7 and 8 August, and the second legs were played on 14 August 2018. The losers from Champions Path entered the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League play-off round, while the losers from League Path entered the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage.\nPlay-off round.\nThe play-off round was split into two separate sections: Champions Path (for league champions) and League Path (for league non-champions). The draw for the play-off round was held on 6 August 2018. The first legs were played on 21 and 22 August, and the second legs were played on 28 and 29 August. The losers from both Champions Path and League Path entered the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage.\nGroup stage.\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 30 August 2018 at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles (introduced starting this season):\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams entered the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League round of 32. The matchdays were 18–19 September, 2–3 October, 23–24 October, 6–7 November, 27–28 November, and 11–12 December 2018.\nThe youth teams of the clubs that qualified for the group stage also participated in the 2018–19 UEFA Youth League on the same matchdays, where they competed in the UEFA Champions League Path (the youth domestic champions of the top 32 associations competed in a separate Domestic Champions Path until the play-offs).\nA total of fifteen national associations were represented in the group stage. 1899 Hoffenheim, Red Star Belgrade (1991 European champions) and Young Boys made their debut appearances in the group stage (although Red Star Belgrade had appeared in the European Cup group stage).\nKnockout phase.\nIn the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final.\nRound of 16.\nThe draw for the round of 16 was held on 17 December 2018. The first legs were played on 12, 13, 19 and 20 February, and the second legs were played on 5, 6, 12 and 13 March 2019.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe draw for the quarter-finals was held on 15 March 2019. The first legs were played on 9 and 10 April, and the second legs were played on 16 and 17 April 2019.\nSemi-finals.\nThe draw for the semi-finals was held on 15 March 2019 (after the quarter-final draw). The first legs were played on 30 April and 1 May, and the second legs were played on 7 and 8 May 2019.\nLiverpool staged an improbable 4–0 comeback win against Barcelona in a return leg fixture at Anfield, having lost the first leg to the Spanish side 3–0 at the Camp Nou. Meanwhile, Ajax were winning 3–0 on aggregate by the 54th minute of the second leg against Tottenham Hotspur, yet Spurs made a similarly dramatic comeback; with Ajax seconds away from the final, Lucas Moura completed his hat-trick in the 96th minute to seal the tie on the away goals rule. Both semifinals are considered among the greatest Champions League comebacks of all time.\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 1 June 2019 at the Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid. The \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held after the quarter-final and semi-final draws.\nStatistics.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.\nSquad of the season.\nOn 2 June 2019, the UEFA technical study group selected the following 20 players as the squad of the tournament.\nPlayers of the season.\nVotes were cast for players of the season by coaches of the 32 teams in the group stage, together with 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, representing each of UEFA's member associations. The coaches were not allowed to vote for players from their own teams. Jury members selected their top three players, with the first receiving five points, the second three and the third one. The shortlist of the top three players was announced on 8 August 2019. The award winners were announced and presented during the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League group stage draw in Monaco on 29 August 2019."

        "text": "The Brigham Young University Women's Rugby team, formerly known as Women's Cougar Rugby Club, participates in the Pacific Desert Rugby Conference D-I in USA Rugby's Women's College rugby D-I National Championship Series Competition. BYU Women's rugby is a sanctioned team under Extramural Sports programs with the Department of Student Life at Brigham Young University. In May 2016, BYU entered its first national championship final ever as an extramural club on campus in Utah, and came in as runner-up to Penn State in the DI Elite Final. More recently, on May 4, 2019, BYU won its first-ever National Title by defeating Virginia Tech by a score of 48–0, to win the 2019 Spring Women's DI College National Championship that was played at Sportsplex Stadium, Matthews, North Carolina.\nHistory.\n“Women’s rugby at BYU began in February 2000, when Julia Hobbs, 19, a sophomore from Norman, OK, put up fliers on campus, asking girls interested in playing to call her.” “Over 100 girls called,” Hobbs said. Many have since dropped out or gone home for the summer — only 12 girls remain.” By Emily Bell – NewsNet Staff Writer – 31 May 2000. Women's Cougars rugby tradition lived on; from those 12 dedicated girls to a highly ranked team in the nation today (2019). To this day, BYU Women's rugby team maintains an average roster of 45 female students.\nEarly years.\nThe Brigham Young University women's rugby team was founded by Shane Seggar, who is the son of John Seggar. John previously founded the BYU men's rugby team when he was a student at BYU in 1962. Coach Shane Seggar moved on from coaching in 2003, and John Seggar took over as head coach from 2000 to 2004. Coach Tom Waqa was given the reigns by the team's committee as head coach of the unofficial team, Women's Cougar Rugby from 2004 until it became an official Extramural Sport on October 8, 2015.\nOn October 28, 2015, Tom Waqa was selected as the new Women's rugby coach of the BYU Women's rugby team.\nPost-season absence.\nPrior to 2007, the National Collegiate Tournament changed the schedule of playing from Friday-Saturday to Saturday-Sunday. This change in schedule and the women's rugby team's affiliation with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints kept them from competing for a national championship because they would not compete on Sundays. Over the next few years, BYU Rugby continued to participate in regular season matches, but they participated in no post-season.\nNational Championship Series.\nIn 2008, USA Rugby returned women's rugby post-season tournament play to a Friday-Saturday format, and BYU women's rugby began playing under USA Rugby Collegiate Tournaments after a successful petition that granted Women's Cougar rugby club a waiver to participate in USA College rugby.\n2010 Sunday forfeit.\nThe women on Brigham Young University's club rugby team made National News on April 16, 2010, when during their quarterfinal match which was scheduled on Sunday, due to an oversight by USA Rugby Competitions Committee, decided to forfeit the national college playoff that weekend in Florida. The Cougars advanced that far in last year's tournament, losing to Penn State, the eventual champion. The team was ranked sixth in Division I and had a good shot. The Cougars defeated Wisconsin-Milwaukee 46–7 on Saturday, however, B.Y.U. did not advance past the Round of 16 that weekend. All 35 team members of the team are Mormons, and because USA Rugby scheduled that round on Sunday, the team decided to forfeit the Sunday game against Penn State.\nResults.\nBYU women's rugby has had several successful seasons. In this past 2008 - 2016 seasons, BYU women's rugby has fought to the top seat in the state of Utah rugby, and are highly ranked in the Nation.\nCollegiate All-Americans.\nHM = Honorable Mention\nNotable players.\nThe following is a list of BYU Women's rugby players who have played for the United States women's national rugby union team, nicknamed Eagles, in a major international competition."

It was run on November 3, 2012 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California with a purse of $5,000,000.\nFort Larned, a 9-1 longshot, won the race in frontrunning fashion, holding off a closing drive by Mucho Macho Man. \nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nGame On Dude was the favorite for the Classic after winning the Hollywood Gold Cup and Awesome Again. Second in the 2011 Classic held at Churchill Downs, Game on Dude was expected to improve at Santa Anita, a track over which he was undefeated at the time. His frontrunning style was expected to give him a tactical advantage in a field that lacked other speed horses.\nHe faced a deep field that lacked star power, in part due to the injury and subsequent retirement of Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner I'll Have Another and Belmont Stakes winner Union Rags. The 12-horse field also included:\nRace Description.\nGame on Dude, who had been expected to set the pace, broke poorly and then experienced traffic problems that took him out of contention. Fort Larned went to the lead and set a brisk pace, trailed by Mucho Macho Man. Fort Larned opened up a lead of nearly three lengths moving into the far turn, then Mucho Macho Man started to close ground. With an eighth of a mile to go, Fort Larned's lead was down to a half length and his jockey Brian Hernandez, Jr. went to the whip. Fort Larned responded and maintained his lead to the finish line, completing the miles in a solid time of 2:00.11. Flat Out was well back in third.\nIt was the first Breeders' Cup win for trainer Ian Wilkes, who had previously been an assistant to Hall of Famer Carl Nafzger. \"We had to be there near the front and he was ready today\", said Wilkes. \"He had galloped great over the track. I knew we were good when he broke sharp. That's where Brian (Hernandez) won the race. We broke sharp and Game On Dude broke bad. I trust Brian because the horse trusts Brian.\"\nOn his 27th birthday, Hernandez also celebrated his first Breeders' Cup win. \"It's the greatest birthday ever\", said Hernandez. \"I always had a lot of confidence in him. Ian (Wilkes) and I talked about the race and he told me don't take him out of his game and let him do whatever he wants to do. He has a good cruising speed and I just let him go.\"\nOwner Janis Whitham was also Fort Larned's breeder. She and her late husband had owned the Champion race mare Bayakoa, two-time winner of the Distaff. Bayakoa was Fort Larned's grand-dam.\nResults.\nSource: Equibase\nTimes: – 0:23.20; – 0:46.50; – 1:10.12; mile – 1:34.66; final – 2:00.11.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:23.20) (:23.30) (:23.62) (:24.54) (:25.45)\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

It was won by one of the race favourites Tom Pidcock of Great Britain ahead of two compatriots.\nRace report.\nThe weeks before the race temperatures had been below zero causing the soil to be frozen and slight rain the night and morning before the race caused the track to be extremely icy and slippery. This was evident right at the start as several riders took a tumble in the first turn, holding up about half the pack.\nThe first lap saw Maxime Bonsergent of France take an early lead, chased by a small group involving Jelle Camps, Toon Vandebosch, Ben Turner, Antoine Benoist and pre-race favorite Tom Pidcock. Pidcock was the only one succeeding to bridge the gap to Bonsergent and together they built up a lead while the rest of the pack quickly spread out and most riders were cycling alone. Already at the end of the second lap, Pidcock had broken away and built up a gap of more than 20 seconds over Bonsergent who had been caught by Ben Turner. Timo Kielich was also in the chasing group but fell hard and dropped outside the top 10. This left the group of Antoine Benoist, Loris Rouiller and Dan Tulett racing for fourth place, another 20 seconds behind Turner and Bonsergent.\nPidcock maintained and extended his lead during the race, never coming in real trouble an easily taking the victory. In the battle for the medals, Bonsergent dropped out as he fell several times and eventually after breaking his derailleur gears and losing a shoe he had to run back to the pits and would eventually finish in 20th place. Tulett caught Turner by the end of lap three and they battled it out for the remaining two medals with Tulett taking the silver in the end. Louis Rouiller came close to both British riders on the final lap but finally came eight seconds short of bronze."

        "text": "In 2011, Kent County Cricket Club competed in Division Two of the County Championship, Group A of the 40-over Clydesdale Bank 40 and the South Group of the Friends Life t20. Kent also hosted a Twenty20 match at the St Lawrence Ground against the touring Indians, and a three-day first-class MCC Universities match against Loughborough MCCU, also at the St Lawrence Ground. It was the second and final season in charge for Director of Cricket Paul Farbrace. The club captain was former England batsman Rob Key who had been club captain since 2006. Pakistan fast bowler Wahab Riaz joined Kent as their overseas player in June, and another fast bowler, South African Charl Langeveldt, signed as Kent's second overseas player for the Friends Life t20 competition only.\nKent finished a very disappointing eighth of nine in Division Two of the County Championship in their first season since relegation from Division One. They won 6 and lost 6 matches in the Clydesdale Bank 40, leaving them in the middle of the final Group A standings (they did not progress to the knock-out stages). Kent did progress to the quarter-final stage of the Friends Life t20 after finishing in 3rd place in the South Group, with the side winning 9 out of 14 completed matches. They lost their quarter final at Grace Road against Leicestershire, in what was a high scoring game, by 3 wickets.\nSquad.\nFast bowler Amjad Khan left Kent at the end of the 2010 season to join Sussex, having been at the county since 2001. This, coupled with injuries affecting the remaining bowling unit, lead to Kent making several new signings.\nPakistan fast bowler Wahab Riaz joined Kent as their overseas player in June. Another fast bowler, South African Charl Langeveldt, signed as Kent's second overseas player for the Friends Life t20 competition only (two overseas players were permitted in this tournament). Langeveldt also played a single match in the Clydesdale Bank Pro40 competition against the Netherlands immediately after the conclusion of the Twenty20 group stage. Charlie Shreck signed on loan from Nottinghamshire in early April, but was recalled by his county just a few days later after playing in just one County Championship match. Shreck would later sign for Kent on a permanent contract after being released by Nottinghamshire at the end of the season, and would remain at the club for the next two seasons.\nSouth Africa-born Scotland international bowler Dewald Nel left Kent early in the season due to an ongoing back injury. Nel had signed a two-year contract with Kent in March 2010. Former Surrey bowler Neil Saker was on trial with Kent over the winter and played four first-class matches in May due to injuries to several other bowlers. However, he did not win a long-term contract. Kent signed David Balcombe from Hampshire on loan in early July initially for one month, but the player remained at the county until the end of the season.\nThe squad for 2011 featured a number of young players, including Adam Ball, Sam Billings, Daniel Bell-Drummond, Adam Riley and Ashley Shaw, who all made their first-class debuts during the season.\nFast bowler Robbie Joseph left the club after the end of the season, having debuted for the county in 2004, and would go on to sign for Leicestershire. Joseph would return to the county for a brief spell in 2014.\nKent suffered a double blow at the end of the 2011 season when high-profile players Joe Denly and Martin van Jaarsveld left the county. Van Jaarsveld had initially agreed to join Leicestershire, but later cancelled the deal and instead announced his retirement from county cricket in November 2011, citing fatigue. Denly signed for Middlesex in order to play Division One cricket and enhance his chances of reviving his international career with England. Denly and van Jaarsveld debuted for Kent in 2004 and 2005, respectively."

        "text": "The Saint Louis Billikens men's ice hockey is an ACHA Division II ice hockey team that plays in the Gold Division (D-II) of the Mid-American Collegiate Hockey Association. They are coached by Head Coach Joe Tomiser and Assistant Coach Connor Bradley. \nHistory.\nDivision I.\nSaint Louis University began sponsoring ice hockey as a Division I sport in 1970, partly to capitalize on the new NHL team, the St. Louis Blues, that had begun playing only three years earlier. The Billikens were able to reach an agreement with Blues owner Sid Salomon Jr. to play their home games at the newly renovated St. Louis Arena, giving Saint Louis by far the largest home venue in the college ranks. Additionally the Billikens were able to secure the services of Bill Selman as head coach. Selman had spent the preceding six years behind the bench for Minnesota–Duluth and North Dakota, helping the Fighting Sioux to back-to-back appearances in the NCAA Tournament in the mid-1960s. The biggest problem Saint Louis faced was finding a conference to compete in. At the time of their start there were effectively only two conferences at the Division-I level, one for eastern teams (ECAC) and one for western teams (WCHA). Because Saint Louis was considered a western team (as were all teams not playing on the eastern seaboard) the Billikens were forced to play as an independent for their first season.\nIn 1971 Saint Louis, Bowling Green and Lake Superior State agreed to form a conference of their own called the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). the Billikens and Falcons began play straight away with the Lakers set to join the following year. The three teams also invited Ohio State and Ohio into the conference. Saint Louis began well, finishing as runners-up in both the regular season and conference tournaments for the first year of league play. Saint Louis also served as the host for the CCHA tournament for the first six years of its existence.\nThe Billikens began to hit their stride in 1972–73 when they won their first conference regular season title, winning the CCHA by 8 points and ending the year with a 27-win season (the best record in the history of the program). Unfortunately a 5–6 overtime loss to Bowling Green in the round-robin tournament meant they finished in second place once more. Spurred on by consecutive near-missed the Billikens won three straight CCHA tournaments in the mid-1970s and two additional regular season titles, placing them firmly atop the conference. Not everything was going well, however. Ohio and Ohio State had left the CCHA after only two seasons and, despite the addition of Lake Superior State, the CCHA was on life-support as a 3-team conference during that period. For both 1974 and 1975 Western Michigan had to be invited to fill out a 4-team bracket which only served to make few take notice of the Billiken's achievements.\nBy 1975 Ohio State had rejoined the CCHA, however, and the conference seemed to be surviving. The next year the NCAA announced that it was granting the selection committee the ability to add up to 4 additional team to the tournament as it saw fit with the express purpose of allowing the CCHA to send a representative. Saint Louis, coming off three consecutive titles, won the 1976–77 regular season crown but fell to Bowling Green 4–5 on aggregate. The program was dealt a mortal blow that offseason when the St. Louis Blues were sold to Ralston Purina and the deal to use the Arena had to be reworked. The new arrangement was far more expensive for the university and when a budget crunch in 1978 forced the school to decide between keeping its ice hockey or basketball programs the board of governors allowed the axe to fall on the hockey team. Despite knowing the fate of the program Bill Selman remained with the Billikens for their final season in 1978–79 before it returned to club status.\nACHA.\nSince 1996 the Saint Louis Billikens have competed in the ACHA, playing in a variety of conferences. \nBillikens in the NHL.\nSource:"

        "title": "2017 Australian Open – Men's singles final",
        "text": "The 2017 Australian Open Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2017 Australian Open. Highly regarded as one of the greatest matches in tennis history, it was contested between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, ranked 17th and 9th in the world respectively. It was their record ninth meeting in a Grand Slam final in their rivalry, and their first meeting in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French Open. In a rematch of the 2009 Australian Open final, which Nadal won in five sets, Federer won the duel in five sets, beating Nadal for the first time in a Grand Slam since the 2007 Wimbledon final. He also trailed Nadal 3–1 in the final set but won five games in a row to win the title. This ended a six-match losing streak against Nadal in Grand Slam events. Having lost their previous three encounters, this was the first time Federer defeated Nadal at the Australian Open and also marked Federer's first Grand Slam victory over Nadal outside the grass courts of Wimbledon. Federer extended his record of Grand Slam singles titles to 18.\nDue to their storied rivalry, the advancing age of both players in their respective careers, critical speculation of the match being their last Grand Slam finals contest against one another, the potential tennis history made from either victory and subsequent implications for their respective legacies, and the match's relevance towards popular and critical discussions on either Federer or Nadal being 'the greatest tennis player of all time', the match, referred by the moniker 'Fedal XXXV', was a 'dream final'. Arguably one of the most highly anticipated matches in the history of tennis, the quality of the performances by both players during the match has resulted in it dubbed one of the most important sporting events ever played, as well as one of the greatest tennis matches of all time.\nBackground.\nFederer and Nadal's participation in this tournament marked their major returns from their 2016 seasons that saw sidelining injuries. Federer, in particular, had not played a tournament since the 2016 Wimbledon semi-final, having aggravated his surgically repaired knee to the extent that he called off the rest of his 2016 season, including missing out the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio that he was keen to compete in for the singles gold medal that eluded him and also playing the highly anticipated mixed doubles pairing with compatriot and fellow tennis great, Martina Hingis. Unable to defend his Cincinnati Open and Swiss Basel Indoors titles and his runner up position at the 2015 Wimbledon and US Open, Federer fell from No. 3 to No. 16 at the end of the 2016, dropping out of the top 5 for the first time since March 2014 and dropping out of the top 10 rankings for the first time since 2002. Contrasting Federer's consistent semi-finals and finals appearances in Grand Slams from 2015 Wimbledon onwards, Nadal failed to make a Grand Slam quarter-final since the 2015 French Open. His last Grand Slam title win was the 2014 French Open, and his last appearance in the Australian Open singles final was against Stan Wawrinka in 2014, which Wawrinka won in four sets. Nadal, however, won the Monte-Carlo Masters title in 2016, while Federer, for the first time since 2000, did not win a tournament title. Before this tournament, Nadal had reached the quarter-finals of the 2017 Brisbane International, losing to Milos Raonic, while Federer had played in the 2017 Hopman Cup in singles and mixed round robins with Belinda Bencic, winning two and losing one match in both singles and mixed doubles (the Swiss team did not qualify for the final).\nEn route to the final, both Federer and Nadal made exceptional campaigns. Federer scored three wins against top-10 seeded players, including a five-set win over Kei Nishikori in the fourth round, which became Federer's 200th win over top-10 players in his career and becoming the first man ever to achieve this feat, and culminating in a gutsy five-set win in the semi-finals over compatriot Stan Wawrinka after surviving several break points in the fifth. Nadal meanwhile scored two top-10 wins, as well as ending Grigor Dimitrov's unbeaten 2017 win streak of ten matches in the semi-finals in a gruelling five-set match that lasted 4 hours and 56 minutes; during the final set, Nadal was in trouble being down 3–4, 15–40, but managed to recover to defeat the Bulgarian in what up until that point was the best match of the tournament. When top seeds Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic were surprisingly knocked out early in the draw, a final between Federer and Nadal was anticipated early due to the two men being on opposite sides of the draw.\nBuild-up.\nFederer's entry in this tournament already drew substantial and critical media attention due to his 6-month layoff from his knee injury, his continued years-long quest for his 18th singles major, and his consistent form and reflected appearances in two semi-finals and two finals in four previous Grand Slam tournaments despite his advancing age. The final between Federer and Nadal further developed from that attention and the match was immediately regarded by fans, fellow tennis contemporaries, pundits and analysts, and the media as a 'dream final' and, more importantly, a match of historical significance for both players, as agreed by many past legends such as Andy Roddick and Pam Shriver as well as renowned tennis analyst Mary Carillo. Due to their respective ages of 35 and 30, the increasing number of years since their last respective Grand Slam title wins, and the perceived declines from their prime years which saw some critics voicing opinions that neither player would ever win a singles major again, it was critically speculated that this tournament final may mark the last time that Federer and Nadal would meet and contest each other in a Grand Slam final. Furthermore, many other pundits and analysts also agreed that this match could very well prove who between Federer and Nadal would be popularly and critically viewed as the \"greatest tennis player of all time\". Federer held the all-time count of Grand Slam singles titles at 17, while Nadal held the second all-time count of 14 tied with Pete Sampras and a dominant head-to-head 23–11 record against Federer. This final would either see Federer breaking his historic all-time record of 17 Grand Slam singles titles, or Nadal winning his 15th Grand Slam singles title which would break the tie between himself and Sampras' Grand Slam title count and subsequently narrow the Grand Slam title count gap between himself and Federer. Furthermore, should Nadal win, he would become the first man in the Open Era to achieve a double career Grand Slam, winning each of the Grand Slams at least twice in men's singles.\nNumerous tennis players and legends voiced their opinions on the match and who would win, including Australian Open promotional interviews with Roy Emerson, Fred Stolle, John McEnroe, Lindsay Davenport, and Rod Laver, in addition to other media interviews with John Newcombe, Martina Navratilova, Lleyton Hewitt, Pat Rafter, Michael Chang, Mary Joe Fernández, and Andy Roddick. Federer's age, his last two disappointing four-set losses in Grand Slam tournament finals, his first tournament return from his six-month layoff and the fact that he had played two five set matches in the last 7 days at the age of 35 were all collectively cited against Federer's chances for winning the final, in addition to the popularly cited Nadal's dominant head-to-head record (including 3-0 against Federer in their previous Australian Open matches), and particular match-up against Federer's game. Players remarked that the court speed would favour Federer's game over Nadal's, and the media noted that Federer's game might be further helped by the courts being comparatively faster than the previous year's Australian Open, but this remains disputed. Further adding to Federer's chances to winning were their last encounter ending in Federer's favour at the 2015 Swiss Basel Indoors, the fact that, despite having played two five-set matches in the past week, Federer had had an additional day of rest compared to Nadal who had recently won his intensely contested five-set semi-final match against Grigor Dimitrov which lasted almost five hours, but most importantly, a noticeably improved and more aggressive backhand that might hold up better against Nadal's high-spinning forehand.\nMatch.\nJames Keothavong of the UK was the chair umpire.\nThe match lasted 3 hours 38 minutes including a medical time-out for Federer after the fourth set. Federer won the first set 6–4 after breaking Nadal in the seventh game. Nadal won the second set 6–3 where he broke Federer twice, and Federer broke back once. The start of the third set saw a crucial momentum swing, where Federer saved three break points in his opening service game, all of which were saved by aces. After holding on to his serve, Federer subsequently broke Nadal twice to take the set 6–1. The fourth set was won by Nadal 6–3, and it came down to a fifth set.\nFederer took an off-court medical time-out at the start of the fifth set. Upon resumption of play, Nadal broke Federer in the first game and was leading the final set 3–1. Federer, however, would prove to be too strong for Nadal afterwards. He broke back to level the set at 3–3. After holding his serve to take the lead 4–3, Federer went on to break Nadal's next service game, which included a 26-shot rally (the longest in the match) at deuce that featured incredible shots from both players that drew a standing ovation from the crowd that lasted nearly a full minute. Whilst serving for the championship at 5–3, Federer had to overcome a 15–40 deficit to reach championship point. On his second championship point, Federer hit a forehand winner that landed on the line of the alley on the deuce side. Nadal challenged the call, but, upon a Hawk-Eye review, the call was upheld, and Federer won the match.\nStatistics.\nThe match statistics followed a similar pattern to those at the 2009 Australian Open final, with a few exceptions: Federer had a higher break point conversion rate than Nadal, while Nadal won a higher percentage of points at the net.\nThe most striking difference between this match and past Fedal Slam finals is that Federer hit more than double the number of winners than Nadal, 73 to 35.\nSource\nSignificance.\nWinning his fifth Australian Open title, Federer extended his all-time record of Grand Slam titles to 18, pulling four ahead of the second all-time count of 14 held by Nadal and Pete Sampras. Federer also became the first man ever to win at least five singles at three different Grand Slams each (Australian Open, Wimbledon, and US Open). In addition to being denied his third effort to win the Australian Open title, Nadal was also denied, for the second time after the 2014 Australian Open final, from becoming the first man to achieve a double career Grand Slam in the Open Era. Furthermore, Federer's victory was his first Grand Slam match win over Nadal since the 2007 Wimbledon final nearly a decade earlier, and also marked Federer's first-ever win over Nadal in a Grand Slam match outside of the grass courts of Wimbledon. Most importantly, Federer's victory marked the culmination of his years-long quest since his 2012 Wimbledon win for his 18th Grand Slam singles title, which previously saw three finals appearances and losses all to then-reigning No. 1 Novak Djokovic at the 2014 Wimbledon, 2015 Wimbledon and the 2015 US Open. At 35 years and 174 days of age, Federer became the second-oldest winner of a Grand Slam after Ken Rosewall since 1972. Considered altogether along with his return from his six-month injury layoff, his 2017 Australian Open run seeing three five-set match wins over the top ten players, and his Grand Slam match history of losses against Nadal, Federer's victory from being down 1–3 in the final set against Nadal is considered by some to be the biggest win in his career.\nFederer's fifth Australian Open title win marked a tournament-record seven-year-long gap between a player's successive Australian Open titles and also established an Open-era Slam record of a 13+ year-long span of winning men's singles Grand Slam titles since his maiden 2003 Wimbledon title win. Winning another Australian Open title also saw Federer increase his all-time record count of hard court singles majors to ten, two ahead of the second all-time count of eight held by Novak Djokovic. In addition, the match was also Federer's career seventh five-set Grand Slam final match, subsequently breaking the all-time career record tie held with Björn Borg of six Grand Slam five-set finals.\nFederer's winning campaign included defeating four top 10 players, three of which went to a fifth set and two of them were back-to-back: fifth seed Kei Nishikori in the fourth round; fourth seed Stan Wawrinka in the semi-final; and ninth seed Nadal in the final. This particular feat was last achieved 35 years ago by the unseeded 17 year-old Mats Wilander at the 1982 French Open. The 2017 Australian Open final also marked Federer's 100th Australian Open match. The victory catapulted Federer back into the top 10 rankings at No. 10, while Nadal's runner-up position advanced his rank from No. 9 to No. 6.\nNadal and Federer would continue their resurgent form throughout the season, each winning two of the four majors (Federer winning a record eighth Wimbledon title, Nadal a record 10th French Open and a third US Open) and finishing as world number one and two respectively. Federer, however, won all four matches between the two during the season, including a fourth-round encounter at Indian Wells and two further finals at the Masters 1000 series events in Miami and Shanghai.\nViewership.\nThe match was one of the most-watched tennis matches in history. Eurosport's coverage of the event reached 9.7 million viewers across Europe, becoming its most-watched tennis match of all-time and the second most-watched sports event in Eurosport’s history, averaging 7.2 million viewers through the match's duration and peaking at 8 million viewers during the final set. Eurosport's coverage of the final also broke local records receiving the highest ever amount of average viewers for a Eurosport programme in the Netherlands with 503,000 viewers and in Spain with 610,000 viewers.\nIn Australia, the free-to-air television broadcast on the Seven Network was the highest-rating Australian Open Men's Singles Final in more than a decade, with a combined 2.668 million viewers in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide &amp; Perth. Including regional viewers (965,000), the figure rose to 3.615 million viewers across Australia. A one-minute period peaked at 4.4 million viewers across Australia. Across the final day of the tournament, 6.5 million Australians watched at least five consecutive minutes of the broadcast. In addition, the match was streamed online in Australia by nearly 190,000 people. The Seven Network had a free-to-air audience share of 54.5% between 6:00 PM and 12:00 AM.\nIn the United States, ESPN said the men’s final drew a record audience since it moved to an overnight time slot in 2005. Starting at 3:30 AM ET Sunday, the five-set match posted a 0.9 overnight rating (~1.05 million households), up 80% from the 2016 final between Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. The network said it likely would be the most-watched program at that hour in ESPN history.\nReactions.\nJoining the social media congratulations and praise from fans, commentators, fellow contemporaries and tennis legends such as Billie Jean King who praised Federer as the greatest of all time, were other sport stars and legends outside of tennis such as Mesut Özil, Ian Thorpe, Alex Morgan, Sachin Tendulkar, Pau Gasol, Luís Figo, Franco Baresi, Karrie Webb, Lin Dan, and Usain Bolt.\n Golf legend 'Golden Bear' Jack Nicklaus, who holds the all-time record of golf majors at the same number of 18, also offered his congratulations to Federer for winning his 18th major tennis singles win.\nCommentators contributed their post-match thoughts. Brad Gilbert said to his fellow commentators Chris McKendry and Darren Cahill that he could easily make a case that Federer, being 1-3 down to his archrival Nadal in the final deciding set, would go on to play the best five games in his career, coming up the most clutch that he has ever been, especially in the face of Nadal and everything that was on line in losing this match to him. Patrick McEnroe of ESPN said that Federer 'out-Rafa'd Rafa', noting that, instead of being emotionally and physically depleted from being grounded down by Nadal's persistence and tenacity, Federer this time around was 'the fighter. . . that was defending, that was scrapping, was coming up with shots on the run' that, coupled with his serve, saw him close the gap between himself and Nadal and then go on to win the deciding set of the match. John McEnroe remarked that Nadal's long semi-final and the one day of difference of rest between him and Federer perhaps made themselves felt in the latter stages of the match. But John McEnroe, who himself in the past was one of the critics who judged that Federer would never again win another major after his 2012 Wimbledon title win, remarked that during the match's final set Federer 'showed more heart and will than he ever has in a singles match in his life,' which led to Federer's victory that in John McEnroe's eyes cemented Federer as being the best player of all time unless Nadal can win additional majors to once again close the gap between their respective Grand Slam singles title count. Due to the form shown by both players, both McEnroe brothers say that Federer and Nadal could very well win at their respective most successful Slams of Wimbledon and the French Open ahead. This prediction proved out to be correct, as later in the year Nadal and Federer, won French Open and Wimbledon respectively, both without dropping a set. Nadal also won the US Open later the same year. In 2018, Federer successfully defended his Australian Open title, defeating finalist Marin Čilić in five sets as well as Nadal successfully defended his French Open title, defeating finalist Thiem in three sets.\nPat Cash criticized Federer's 'lengthy break' after the 4th set due to a medical time-out, accusing him of \"legal\" cheating and criticized the tournament for allowing Federer to do so. In response, Federer said that Cash was unfair and exaggerating in his criticism, elaborating that his quad and groin began to hurt through the second and third sets respectively and finally warranted a medical time-out after the end of the fourth set. Further defending his integrity, Federer said that he was the last guy to take a medical time-out, much less abuse it, citing his 20-year career of having not called a medical time-out prior to the 2017 Australian Open. When asked in the post-match conference for his thoughts, Nadal was indifferent, \"[having] no opinion and didn't know what was going on\". Nadal himself had taken a brief break in which he went to the dressing room and returned to court in fresh clothes. As precedence, Nadal also took a time-out in the 2014 final against Stan Wawrinka when he was behind, and came back to play better and win the third set in that final following the break. Nadal's uncle and coach, Toni Nadal, also believed that Federer's medical time out was not called to secure an advantage from stopping the match's rhythm and pace. In fact, Nadal broke Federer's serve immediately after the time-out."

        "title": "St Andrew's Church, Rugby",
        "text": "The Church of St Andrew is a Church of England parish church and civic church in the centre of Rugby, in Warwickshire, England. It is a grade II* listed building. It is unique in having two peals of bells hung in separate towers and is part of the Major Churches Network. The church has medieval origins, but was greatly enlarged during the Victorian era.\nHistory.\nMedieval.\nThe first record of a church at the site was from 1140, originally as a chapel of ease of the mother church at nearby Clifton-upon-Dunsmore, until Rugby became a parish in 1221, and the chapel was upgraded to a parish church. Nothing is thought to remain of the original church, as it is believed to have been sited some metres away from the later building. It was rebuilt on the present site in either the 13th or 14th century. The oldest surviving parts of the present church are the North aisle and the high West tower, which is unusual in that its appearance and construction bears strong resemblance to that of a castle tower, meaning it was likely built to serve a defensive as well as religious role. According to a local legend, the tower was built from stones from a castle at Rugby, which had been demolished on the orders of Henry II, who forbade private fortifications without royal approval, however there was no prohibition against fortified churches, and so the tower may have been constructed, nominally as an addition to the church, but in reality as a way to provide a place of defence, while still conforming to the statute. The West tower is usually dated to the 14th century, but was possibly built during the reign of Henry III (1216–1272), and is Rugby's oldest building. The church has other artefacts of medieval Rugby including the 13th-century parish chest, and a medieval font.\n19th century expansion.\nIn order to cater for the growing population of the town, the church was enlarged several times in 1797, 1814, and then again in 1830, becoming ever larger. This involved demolition of much of the older church and resulted in the loss of some 14th century wall paintings. \nIn the late 19th century, due to the dilapidation of the building, St Andrew's was extensively rebuilt on a much larger footprint to the designs of William Butterfield, retaining only the West tower and North nave arcade from the medieval church. The main works were carried out between 1877 and 1879, with further additions from 1895 to 1896, by Ewan Christian to Butterfield's original designs, including a new East tower, added in 1895 which has a spire high.\nVery unusually, both of the church towers have ringable bells, the main peal of eight bells (all cast in 1896 by Mears &amp; Stainbank, London) being located in the East tower, and the old peal of five bells (all cast in 1711 by Joseph Smith of Edgbaston) located in the West tower.\nOn 11 October 1949, the church was designated a grade II* listed building.\nArchitecture.\nExternally the church is built from cream Bath stone under a grey slate roof. Internally, and in true Butterfield style, the supporting pillars are in bands of cream Bath stone and red Alton stone and there is much use of polychromatic tiles to the floor and walls in red, cream, grey and black. Overall the interior scheme is considered by many to be the pinnacle of Butterfied's achievement, his masterpiece, showing great finesse and sophistication. It has a painted ceiling reaching up sixty feet. There is stained glass, notably by Clayton and Bell, especially the East window and West window by the same company. There are two lancet windows partially obscured by the organ and a Rose Window completely hidden behind the organ. \nNear the organ and again partially obscured by it, is a mosaic by the renowned Italian company of Antonio Salviati of Murano, Venice, probably in collaboration with Clayton and Bell.\nDuring the period from 1909 to 1936 extensive works by Alex Millar, a highly regarded sculptor and leading member of the Campden Guild of Handicrafts, were commissioned. These include a statue of the Madonna and Child in the Lady Chapel, the reredos behind the high altar and a superb set of wrought iron screens in front of the chancel and Lady Chapel and a set of three screens flankng the chancel and Lady Chapel. Together they represent one of the largest complete sets of Millers work.\nThe design of the church's East tower and spire bears resemblance to some of Butterfield's other works such as Adelaide Cathedral.\nPresent day.\nSt Andrew's stands in the liberal catholic tradition of the Church of England."

        "title": "Super Bowl LVI",
        "text": "Super Bowl LVI was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20. The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium. Currently, this is the latest date for a Super Bowl during the calendar year.\nThe Rams' victory was their first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII. Each team finished the regular season as their respective conference's 4-seed, making this the first Super Bowl without a top-3 seed since seeding was introduced in .\nThe game had three lead changes and mostly kept within a one-possession margin. Los Angeles led 13–10 at halftime, but the Bengals scored 10 straight points on their first two drives in the third quarter. Trailing 20–16 in the fourth, the Rams scored a touchdown to retake the lead with under two minutes remaining and stopped Cincinnati's final drive on downs. Wide receiver Cooper Kupp, who converted a fourth down on the Rams' final drive and scored the game-winning touchdown, was named Super Bowl MVP.\nNBC's broadcast of Super Bowl LVI was the second-most watched in the game's history, marking a shift from several years of declining ratings. Seen by an average of 112.3 million total viewers on both NBC and its streaming platforms, the game's ratings were up 8% from the previous Super Bowl.\nBackground.\nHost selection process.\nIn contrast to most previous Super Bowls, no bids were accepted for Super Bowl LVI. The bids for Super Bowl LIII, Super Bowl LIV, and Super Bowl LV were all drawn from the same pool of candidates in a meeting on May 24, 2016. Atlanta, Miami, Los Angeles, and Tampa Bay were the four candidates for the three contests; Atlanta received Super Bowl LIII, Miami received Super Bowl LIV, and Los Angeles (which declined to bid on Super Bowl LIV and was not eligible for Super Bowl LIII) was granted Super Bowl LV.\nOn May 18, 2017, authorities announced that the opening of Los Angeles's new stadium, SoFi Stadium, originally scheduled for the start of the 2019 season, had been delayed a year to 2020. As a result, at the league's owners meetings in Chicago on May 23, 2017, the league re-awarded Super Bowl LV to the lone remaining candidate, Tampa Bay, and awarded Super Bowl LVI to Los Angeles.\nThe official logo for the game was unveiled on February 9, 2021, maintaining the standard design used since Super Bowl LI, but introducing sunset-themed designs reflecting the landscape of the host city/nearby area (featuring in this case palm trees) within the traditional Roman numerals.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn early January 2022, it was reported that AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, was being considered as an alternate site for the game as a contingency plan due to an increase of COVID-19 infections in California attributed to the Omicron variant. The stadium last hosted Super Bowl XLV in 2011. However, the NFL later confirmed on January 13 that the game would remain at SoFi Stadium.\nAttendance at the game was not limited, unlike Super Bowl LV in 2021, which was played with an audience at 37% of the capacity. Fans who went to the Super Bowl festivities prior to the game and those who attended the Super Bowl received a free KN95 mask. Per Los Angeles County public health orders, those attending the game were required to show proof of vaccination, a negative PCR test that was taken within 48 hours, or a negative antigen test that was taken within 24 hours. The proof of vaccination requirement had been implemented for large outdoor events in Los Angeles County since October 2021.\nThose requesting media accreditation for the Super Bowl and playoffs were required to be fully vaccinated and have received at least one booster dose of vaccine.\nTeams.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nThe Los Angeles Rams finished the 2021 season with a record under fifth-year head coach Sean McVay. This was their fifth Super Bowl appearance, third as a Los Angeles–based team, and second under McVay. The franchise held a 1–3 Super Bowl record prior to the game, winning Super Bowl XXXIV in 1999 as the St. Louis Rams. They also won two pre-Super Bowl era championships in 1945 as the Cleveland Rams and 1951 during their first stint in Los Angeles.\nAfter the Rams lost 2018's Super Bowl LIII, quarterback Jared Goff suffered a decline in production, which led to tension between Goff and McVay. Ahead of the 2021 season, the Rams traded Goff, two first-round picks, and a third-round pick to the Detroit Lions in exchange for 12-year veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford. Selected first overall by the Lions in the 2009 NFL Draft, Stafford held an 0–3 playoff record, but ranked in the top 20 of major passing categories and was considered more suited to Los Angeles' offense. The team made another significant acquisition midway through the season when they traded a second- and third-round draft pick to the Denver Broncos for eight-time Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller. A few weeks later, they signed free agent wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., a three-time Pro Bowl selection, after he was released by the Cleveland Browns.\nThe Rams' offense ranked ninth in yards (6,325) and tied with the Bengals for eighth in points scored (460). Stafford had career highs in touchdowns (41) and completion percentage (67.2), although he led the league in interceptions (17). He also set franchise records for single-season pass completions (404) and passing yards (4,886), while tying the passing touchdowns record. Wide receiver Cooper Kupp became the fourth NFL player and first since 2005 to obtain the receiving triple crown by leading the league in receptions (145), receiving yards (1,947), and receiving touchdowns (16). The Offensive Player of the Year, his receiving yards and receptions were both the second-most in a season. Kupp was joined by wide receiver Van Jefferson, who had 802 receiving yards and 6 touchdowns, and tight end Tyler Higbee, who had 560 receiving yards. Beckham added 537 yards and 5 touchdowns. The team's leading rusher at 845 yards was running back Sony Michel, who was acquired in a trade with the New England Patriots after Cam Akers missed most of the regular season with an Achilles tendon injury. Akers returned to the active roster ahead of the playoffs. Running back Darrell Henderson added 688 rushing yards until he suffered a season-ending injury in Week 16. The Rams' offensive line was led by 16-year veteran tackle Andrew Whitworth, who spent his first 11 seasons with the Bengals.\nDefensively, the Rams ranked 17th in yards allowed (5,863) and 15th in points allowed (372). Named to the Pro Bowl were defensive tackle Aaron Donald, who led the team in sacks (12.5), and cornerback Jalen Ramsey, whose 4 interceptions were tied with safety Taylor Rapp for the most on the team. Linebacker Leonard Floyd complemented Donald with 9.5 sacks and Miller had 5 sacks after joining the team. The safety tandem of Rapp (64 solo tackles, 94 total) and Jordan Fuller (63 solo tackles, 113 total) had the most solo and combined tackles for the Rams, respectively. After an injury in the regular season finale forced Fuller to miss the playoffs, Los Angeles signed six-time Pro Bowl safety Eric Weddle out of retirement, who last played for the Rams in 2019. On special teams, placekicker Matt Gay earned Pro Bowl honors after leading the league in field goal percentage (94.1).\nCincinnati Bengals.\nThe Cincinnati Bengals finished the season with a record under third-year head coach Zac Taylor.\nThis was their third Super Bowl appearance, following 1981's Super Bowl XVI and 1988's Super Bowl XXIII. After losing both, the Bengals saw little success and had not won a playoff game since the 1990 season, which was the longest active drought in the four major North American sports.\nEntering the 2021 season, the Bengals were considered unlikely to make the Super Bowl. They finished the previous three seasons at the bottom of the AFC North and had not made the playoffs since 2015. Cincinnati was also only two years removed from a league-worst 2–14 record during Taylor's first season. This finish granted the Bengals the first overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft, which they used to select Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Joe Burrow. Burrow posted strong numbers as a rookie, but won only two games before his season was cut short by a knee injury. In the following year's draft, Cincinnati used the fifth overall pick on wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase, who was Burrow's teammate at LSU. The team also drafted placekicker Evan McPherson in the fifth round. On defense, the Bengals signed free agent defensive end Trey Hendrickson, who was coming off a breakout season with the New Orleans Saints. Defensive tackles Larry Ogunjobi and B. J. Hill were also acquired through free agency and a trade with the New York Giants, respectively.\nThe reunion of Burrow and Chase brought success to the Bengals, whose offense went from 29th in yards and points scored the previous season to 13th in yards (6,145) and tied for eighth in points scored (460). In his first full season, Burrow led the league in completion percentage (70.4) and yards per attempt (8.9), despite also leading the league in sacks taken (51). He set the season franchise records for passing yards (4,611) and touchdowns (34), along with the franchise record for single-game passing yards (525), and was named Comeback Player of the Year. Chase was fourth in receiving yards (1,455) and third in receiving touchdowns (13), both of which led the AFC. The Offensive Rookie of the Year, his receiving yards were the most for a rookie in the Super Bowl era and he set the rookie record for receiving yards in a game (266). Complementing Chase was wide receiver Tee Higgins, who obtained 1,081 receiving yards, making the Bengals one of only five teams with two 1,000 yard-receivers. Wide receiver Tyler Boyd further bolstered the receiving corps with 828 receiving yards and 5 touchdowns. Tight end C. J. Uzomah, who missed most of the previous year with a torn Achilles, had a breakout season by setting career highs in receiving yards (493) and touchdowns (5). Pro Bowl running back Joe Mixon was third in the NFL in rushing yards (1,205) and fourth in rushing touchdowns (13), while also recording 314 receiving yards and 3 receiving touchdowns.\nCincinnati's defense was 18th in yards allowed (5,964) and 17th in points allowed (376). Hendrickson ranked fifth in sacks (14), earning him his first Pro Bowl selection. Rounding out the defensive line, Hill had 5.5 sacks and 50 combined tackles, Ogunjobi had 7 sacks and 49 combined tackles, and defensive end Sam Hubbard had 7.5 sacks and 62 combined tackles. Linebacker Logan Wilson led the team in interceptions (4) and combined tackles (100), while safety Jessie Bates had the most solo tackles (62). McPherson, who was named to the 2021 PFWA All-Rookie Team, set the franchise records for the most 50-yard field goals converted in a season (9) and the longest field goal converted (58).\nPlayoffs.\nThe Rams won their Wild Card matchup against the NFC West rival Arizona Cardinals in a 34–11 rout, marking the first career postseason win for Stafford. In the Divisional Round, the Rams took a 27–3 lead against the defending Super Bowl LV champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but committed a series of fumbles that led to the Buccaneers tying the game with 42 seconds remaining. Nevertheless, Stafford drove the Rams 63 yards off two passes to Kupp, which allowed Gay to kick the game-winning field goal as time expired. The NFC Championship Game pitted the Rams against the NFC West rival San Francisco 49ers, who swept them in the regular season and held a 6–0 record in games with quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. Los Angeles trailed 17–7 entering the fourth quarter, but scored 13 consecutive points to take the lead with under two minutes remaining. The rally was marked by San Francisco committing several miscues, including 49ers safety Jaquiski Tartt dropping a potential interception. On the 49ers' final drive, Donald forced a pass from Garoppolo that was intercepted by linebacker Travin Howard to secure the 20–17 victory. Higbee suffered a knee injury during the game that forced him to miss the Super Bowl.\nThe Bengals defeated the Las Vegas Raiders 26–19 in the Wild Card Round for their first playoff victory since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports. However, Ogunjobi suffered a foot injury that ruled him out for the remainder of the postseason. Their victory also came with controversy when a touchdown pass from Burrow to Boyd appeared to be whistled dead by an official before Boyd caught the ball. Cincinnati defeated the top-seeded Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round 19–16 off a last-second field goal by McPherson, which was the franchise's first away playoff win. The victory occurred despite Burrow being sacked nine times, tying Warren Moon's 1993 postseason record and making him the most-sacked quarterback to win a playoff game. McPherson also became the first kicker to convert four field goals in separate rounds of the same postseason. In the AFC Championship Game against the two-time defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs, Cincinnati fell into a 21–3 deficit during the first half, but rallied to take a 24–21 lead in the fourth quarter. The game went into overtime, in which safety Vonn Bell intercepted Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes on the first drive and McPherson converted a 31-yard field goal to send the Bengals to their first Super Bowl since 1988. Cincinnati's 18-point comeback was tied with the 2006 Indianapolis Colts for the largest in a conference championship.\nPre-game notes.\nThis was the first Super Bowl to be played on the second Sunday in February, following the adoption of a 17-game schedule in 2021. From the 2003 to 2020 seasons, all Super Bowls were played on the first Sunday in February. This was the second warmest Super Bowl on record with a kickoff temperature of , behind Super Bowl VII.\nThe Rams became the first NFL team to have their home stadium host both a conference championship game and the Super Bowl in the same season. However, the Rams were the designated visiting team as the home team alternates between the two conferences annually. Nevertheless, they still used their home locker room. The Bengals used the home locker room of the Los Angeles Chargers, who share the stadium with the Rams. This was the Rams' second Super Bowl in their home market, along with 1979's Super Bowl XIV, which was played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.\nAs the designated home team, the Bengals chose to wear their home black jerseys with white pants. The Rams selected newly unveiled alternate white jerseys with yellow pants.\nThe Bengals were the third team to make the Super Bowl after having the league's worst record two years earlier, following the 1981 San Francisco 49ers and the 2003 Carolina Panthers.\nWith McVay at age 36 and Taylor at age 38, Super Bowl LVI featured the youngest pair of head coaches in Super Bowl history and was the first to have both under 40. They were the two youngest head coaches in the league during the 2021 season. Taylor served on the Rams coaching staff under McVay from 2017 to 2018 and was hired as Cincinnati's head coach after Super Bowl LIII. Whitworth, at age 40, was the first player in a Super Bowl to be older than both head coaches.\nThis was the first Super Bowl in which both starting quarterbacks held career losing records. It was also the second in which both were first overall selections in the NFL Draft, along with Super Bowl 50. Burrow reached the Super Bowl faster than any previous quarterback taken first overall by doing so in his second season.\nEntertainment.\nPre-game ceremonies.\nCountry singer Mickey Guyton performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", making her the first black female country singer to perform the national anthem at the game. She was backed by several background singers. Jhené Aiko, accompanied by harpist Gracie Sprout, performed \"America the Beautiful\". Sandra Mae Frank performed both songs in American Sign Language alongside Guyton and Aiko, with full coverage of the ASL performance available on the NBC Sports app. Mary Mary, accompanied by the Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles, performed \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\". Electronic music producer Zedd served as DJ during pre-game warmups. The flyover was conducted by a 5-plane formation by the USAF Air Combat Command demonstration teams with an A-10 Thunderbolt II, an F-16 Fighting Falcon, an F-22 Raptor, and an F-35 Lightning II as well as a P-51 Mustang representing the Air Force Heritage Flight. Former tennis player Billie Jean King then participated in the coin toss ceremony, honoring the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the federal civil rights law prohibiting sex discrimination in education programs. Dwayne Johnson introduced both teams using his persona as The Rock from the WWE.\nHalftime show.\nThis was the final halftime show to be sponsored by Pepsi. The halftime show was headlined by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, and Kendrick Lamar, and it was widely praised. Surprise appearances were made by 50 Cent and Anderson .Paak. Deaf rappers Sean Forbes and Warren Snipe performed in American Sign Language during the show; this was the first time that American Sign Language was used during a halftime show at the Super Bowl. Described as a \"legends of hip hop\" performance, evoking nostalgia and localizing the globally broadcast game to Southern California with Dre's performance, it was the third show in partnership with Jay Z's Roc Nation. Eminem knelt after his set as a tribute to Colin Kaepernick. A rumor claimed that Eminem had been told by the NFL to stand up rather than kneel. However, an NFL spokesman told \"The New York Times\" that officials watched the taking the knee gesture \"during rehearsals this week.\" A list in \"Rolling Stone\" by Rob Sheffield praised the performance as an \"old-school West Coast rap history lesson\" and ranked it as the fourth-best Super Bowl halftime show of all time, behind those by Beyoncé, U2, and Prince. He wrote that Kendrick Lamar deserved his own full-length performance.\nBroadcasting.\nUnited States.\nTelevision.\nSuper Bowl LVI was televised by NBC, as part of a one-time modification to the annual cycle among the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. Under the normal cycle the game would have been televised by CBS. However, in order to avoid counterprogramming the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing—which are televised exclusively by NBC—the NFL announced on March 13, 2019, that NBC had agreed to swap 2021's Super Bowl LV to CBS in exchange for Super Bowl LVI. This swap gave NBC the rights to both events and the network planned to maximize the advertising revenue from both events (as it did for Super Bowl LII prior to the 2018 Olympics). NBC subsequently announced in November 2021 that a block of primetime coverage for the Winter Olympics would air after Super Bowl LVI in lieu of new entertainment programming. \nThis situation was also codified in the NFL's new 11-year media contracts taking effect in the 2023 season (which expands the Super Bowl rotation to four networks), where the cycle is aligned to give NBC rights to the Super Bowl in the future Winter Olympic years of 2026, 2030, and 2034.\nNBC's broadcast featured Al Michaels as the lead broadcaster with Cris Collinsworth as the analyst. Michele Tafoya reported from the Rams' sideline with Kathryn Tappen reporting from the Bengals’ sideline. This was Michaels' eleventh Super Bowl as a broadcaster, tying him with Pat Summerall for the most Super Bowls on television play-by-play. Collinsworth worked his fifth Super Bowl as an analyst, and his fourth since replacing John Madden as lead analyst. This would be the final game at NBC for both Michaels and Tafoya; following the game, Tafoya announced that she would be leaving her position to pursue other interests outside of sports broadcasting, and Amazon Prime Video announced that Michaels would move to \"Thursday Night Football\" in the 2022 season. NBC employed additional goal line, sideline and end zone camera angles, and a new on-air graphics package. The broadcast featured a special introduction starring actress Halle Berry.\nAs Mike Tirico was the studio host for both the NFL and the Olympics, he traveled back from Beijing part-way through the Games' opening week, and briefly hosted its primetime coverage from NBC Sports' headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut (using a redecorated version of the \"Football Night in America\" set) before flying out to Los Angeles for Super Bowl weekend. Tirico then presented the Games' primetime coverage from NBC's lakeside set on the SoFi Stadium grounds, before returning to Stamford after the Super Bowl.\nThe game was broadcast in Spanish by NBC's sister network Telemundo, the first time that a dedicated Spanish-language telecast aired on broadcast television. Carlos Mauricio Ramirez handled play by play duties while Jorge Andres and Rolando Cantu handled in-booth, pre-game and post-game analysis. Ariana Figuera was the reporter on the field and Miguel Gurwitz led supporting pre-game, halftime and post-game coverage. Alongside NBC's presences in and around SoFi Stadium, Telemundo originated a pre-game show from Plaza México in Lynwood to showcase California's Latino community.\nAdvertising.\nNBC charged $6.5–$7 million for a 30-second commercial at Super Bowl LVI; CBS was paid $5.5 million the previous year for Super Bowl ads. Budweiser, Coca-Cola, Hyundai, and Pepsi were among the sponsors that returned after skipping the previous Super Bowl due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, HBO Max, Netflix, Disney, Sony Pictures, Warner Bros., Peacock, AMC+, and Amazon Prime Video promoted their upcoming films and series during the game. These included \"Jurassic World Dominion\", \"Nope\", \"Ambulance\", \"The Lost City\", \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2\", ', \"The Adam Project\", \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\", \"Moon Knight\", \"Uncharted\", the DC Extended Universe's 2022 film slate, \"Bel-Air\", \"Joe vs. Carole\", and '.\nThe advertising during the game stood out for a high number of celebrity cameos and advertisements for futuristic technology, particularly for products like electric vehicles, virtual reality and cryptocurrency. There were many cryptocurrency-related ads drawing comparisons to dot-com commercials during Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000, leading some to refer to the game as the \"Crypto Bowl\". Critics echoed their reception of the halftime show performance said a number of ads prominently referenced media from the 1990s and 2000s, geared to evoke nostalgia among Generation X and Millennial audiences.\nThe Super Bowl Ad Meter survey conducted by \"USA Today\" was won by Rocket Mortgage for their ad featuring Anna Kendrick advertising a Barbie toy house while facing the grim realities of the modern housing and real estate market.\nStreaming.\nSuper Bowl LVI was streamed on NBCSports.com, the NBC Sports app, and Peacock Premium. This was the final game under the NFL's deal with Verizon (following the game NFL+ would be required to watch local games beginning in the 2022 season), as the game was also available on the NFL mobile app and the Yahoo! Sports mobile app for free. As part of its partnerships with the league, Verizon offered \"5G Multi-View\" features for attendees at SoFi Stadium.\nRadio.\nThe nationwide radio coverage was carried by Westwood One Sports. Kevin Harlan was the play-by-play commentator with analysis from Kurt Warner. Laura Okmin, and Mike Golic were the sideline reporters for each team, and Gene Steratore served as the rules analyst for the broadcast. Scott Graham served as pregame and postgame host, with Willie McGinest as his co-host.\nRatings and viewership.\nThe broadcast of Super Bowl LVI drew the second-largest Super Bowl audience in history, tied with Super Bowl 50, reversing several years of decline with a total of 112.3 million viewers. About 101.1 million viewers watched Super Bowl LVI on linear television in the United States, representing an 8% increase from the previous year's game. The broadcast on NBC had 99.2 million viewers and 1.9 million viewed the Spanish-language Telemundo broadcast which was the first Spanish-language broadcast to carry the Super Bowl. According to NBC, it was the largest audience in U.S. Spanish-language history.\n11.2 million viewers watched via streaming services (including co-viewing from connected devices), nearly doubling the record set by Super Bowl LV the year before which had 5.7 million viewers via streaming.\nWhile viewership was up household ratings were nearly at an all-time low. The game's overall rating of 36.9 was the lowest since Super Bowl III (36.0) and the third-lowest Super Bowl of all time.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nThe Bengals won the coin toss and deferred to the second half; the Rams received the ball at the kickoff. Cincinnati's Trey Hendrickson sacked Matthew Stafford, leading to a punt by Los Angeles. The Bengals drove towards midfield, but were stalled on fourth down, when Ernest Jones knocked down Joe Burrow's pass to Ja'Marr Chase. Los Angeles took over at their own 49-yard-line. A 3rd-and-4 was converted with a 20-yard completion from Stafford to Cooper Kupp and the Rams got into the red zone on the next play with a 4-yard Henderson rush. Two plays later, the game's first score came by way of a 17-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to Odell Beckham Jr. Unable to respond immediately, the Bengals went three-and-out, and Kevin Huber's punt was downed at the Los Angeles 28-yard-line. The Rams were similarly unproductive on their next drive, as a delay of game penalty erased a five-yard gain on first down and a catch by Van Jefferson on third down was short of a first down. Hekker's punt was returned to the Cincinnati 30-yard-line, where the Bengals started their next series. On the drive's second play, a 46-yard pass from Burrow to Chase advanced the ball to the Los Angeles 11-yard-line, though three straight incomplete passes forced a 29-yard field goal attempt, which was converted by Evan McPherson, making the score 7–3 Rams. After a touchback, the Rams got the ball on their own 25-yard-line; they ran one play, an Akers rush for a loss of one yard, before the first quarter ended.\nThe Rams started the second quarter facing 2nd-and-11 on their own 24-yard-line. An unsuccessful deep pass from Stafford to Kupp was immediately followed by a 35-yard pass to Beckham and a 25-yard pass to Henderson. Now inside the red zone at the Cincinnati 16-yard-line, Henderson rushed for five yards before Stafford passed to Kupp for an 11-yard touchdown. The extra point was unsuccessful as Hekker mishandled the snap, then threw an interception to Germaine Pratt, keeping the Rams lead at 13–3. The ensuing kickoff was a touchback, and the Bengals advanced the ball 75 yards in 14 plays, with Burrow completing 5/5 passes for 38 yards while Joe Mixon rushed 6 times for 26 yards. On the last play, Mixon took a pitch from Burrow and then passed to Tee Higgins with a halfback pass for a 6-yard-touchdown. Another touchback followed and the Rams began their drive with a pair of plays totaling 19 yards, which got them to their own 44-yard-line. After a knee injury to Beckham Jr., which sidelined him for the rest of the game, a false start penalty backed them up five yards. The drive ended on 3rd-and-14 at the Bengals' 43-yard-line, when Stafford's pass downfield was intercepted by Jessie Bates in the end zone for a touchback. The Bengals got possession at their own 10-yard-line (backed up ten yards as the result of an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty). The short drive was unsuccessful, and they punted with 42 seconds remaining. The Rams responded with a drive that was even shorter, as they went three-and-out in 26 seconds and punted back to Cincinnati; Burrow then took a knee to end the half.\nSecond half.\nCincinnati had their first lead of the game on the first play of the second half, when Burrow threw a deep pass to Higgins on near the left sideline, who was tangled up with defensive back Jalen Ramsey. Ramsey fell down just before Higgins caught a pass, leaving him wide open. Higgins ran to the end zone scoring a 75-yard touchdown. Replays showed Higgins grabbing Ramsey's facemask before the catch, but no penalty flag was thrown and the touchdown stood, giving the Bengals a 17–13 lead. Things got worse for the Rams, as Stafford threw a pass that bounced off the hand of receiver Ben Skowronek and was intercepted at the Rams' 32-yard-line by Chidobe Awuzie. Cincinnati was able to capitalize with a 38-yard field goal made by McPherson, after being pushed back nine yards by a sack by Aaron Donald on the previous play. Now leading by seven points, the Bengals kicked off for a touchback. Shortly into the drive, the Rams faced a 3rd-and-8, which they converted for 15 yards with a pass from Stafford to Henderson. Overall, the drive covered 11 plays and 52 yards, with Stafford completing 4/5 passes for 44 yards before Matt Gay's 41-yard field goal made the score 20–16 with 6:02 left in the third quarter. Four consecutive three-and-outs followed, with the Bengals punting with 43 seconds remaining in the quarter and the Rams running a single play, a five-yard Akers rush to the Cincinnati 47-yard-line, before the third quarter came to an end.\nThe Rams punted three plays into the fourth quarter, giving the Bengals the ball at their own 16-yard-line. A 16-yard pass from Burrow to Boyd on second down went for a 16-yard gain, but from there the Cincinnati offense stalled and an unnecessary roughness penalty on third down forced a punt on 4th-and-29, which was returned to the Los Angeles 35-yard-line. The Rams punted the ball back after another three-and-out of their own, and Cincinnati took over after the punt went out of bounds at their 16-yard-line. A 12-yard rush by Mixon gained a first down on the drive's first play and a 3-yard pass from Burrow to Chris Evans then gained another first down on 3rd-and-2; however, Cincinnati was not able to gain another first down and punted three plays later on 4th-and-9. Receiving the ball on their own 21-yard-line, the Rams found themselves facing 4th-and-1 just four plays into the drive, but a 7-yard rush by Kupp on an end-around converted it for a first down. They reached Bengals' territory three plays later. A 22-yard pass from Stafford to Kupp a few plays afterwards got them to the Bengals' 24-yard-line and they reached the red zone with another Stafford to Kupp pass, this for 8 yards. After the two-minute warning, three incomplete passes followed, but a holding penalty on linebacker Logan Wilson gave the Rams a first down. After the next play (a touchdown cancelled by offsetting penalties against both teams), Bengals' defensive back Eli Apple was flagged for pass interference in the end zone, bringing up first and goal from the 1. Two plays later, Stafford threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Kupp, giving the Rams a 23–20 lead with 1:25 left on the clock. The Bengals got the ball back at their own 25-yard-line and quickly gained 26 yards on a 17-yard pass to Chase and a 9-yard catch by Boyd, respectively. After an incomplete pass, Donald and fellow lineman Greg Gaines tackled Samaje Perine for no gain, bringing up 4th-and-1. The Bengals decided to pass the ball for a first down, but Donald wrapped Burrow up before he could make the throw. Burrow still managed to attempt a desperation pass to Perine as he was being taken down, but the ball fell short, causing a turnover on downs and enabling Los Angeles to run out the rest of the clock with a quarterback kneel. Kupp was named the Super Bowl MVP, with eight receptions for 92 yards and two touchdowns, including three receptions and a touchdown (as well as one carry for seven yards) on the Rams final drive.\nFinal statistics.\nIndividual statistics.\nCompletions/attempts&lt;br&gt;Carries&lt;br&gt;Long gain&lt;br&gt;Receptions&lt;br&gt;Times targeted\nOfficials.\nSuper Bowl LVI featured seven officials. Continuing a practice instituted the previous year an alternate official was assigned for each position of an official on the field and the replay official. The numbers in parentheses below indicate their uniform numbers.\nAftermath.\nThe 2022 Rams finished 5–12, setting the records for the most losses, lowest winning percentage (.294), and longest losing streak (six games) for a defending Super Bowl champion. They were also the first defending Super Bowl champion to miss the playoffs since the 2016 Denver Broncos and first to have a losing record since the 2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThe 2022 Bengals tied their franchise-best 12–4 record and clinched the franchise's first consecutive division title. They won a playoff game in consecutive seasons, another franchise first, before being defeated by the eventual Super Bowl LVII champion Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game."

Djokovic then lost to Nick Kyrgios in straight sets.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nDjokovic beat British Kyle Edmund in the second round and del Potro with a strong third set in the third round. The win over del Potro gave Djokovic his 19th consecutive win at Indian Wells, the longest win streak in the event's 43-year history. The streak was then ended, as Djokovic was beaten again by Kyrgios who overpowered him with first and second serves and a varied overall game.\nEuropean clay court season.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nDjokovic was hanging onto a thread throughout the tournament till the quarterfinals where that thread was cut by Belgian David Goffin, where he lost in 3 tight sets.\nMadrid Open.\nDjokovic beat Spaniards Nicolás Almagro and Feliciano López in succession before receiving a walkover when Kei Nishikori withdrew with a wrist injury. Rafael Nadal then ended his seven match losing streak against Djokovic with a comprehensive straight sets win.\nItalian Open.\nDjokovic successfully defended his 2016-point total by reaching the final after straight set victories over Aljaž Bedene, Roberto Bautista Agut, Juan Martín del Potro, and Dominic Thiem. However, Djokovic was then stopped by 20-year-old Alexander Zverev Jr. in the final. Shortly after the match, Djokovic confirmed a coaching partnership with Andre Agassi, beginning at Roland-Garros.\nFrench Open.\nDjokovic was the defending champion. He made it to the quarter-finals, losing to Dominic Thiem in straight sets including a bagel in the final set.\nGrass court season.\nEastbourne International.\nDjokovic took a wild card in an effort to pick up some match play on grass. It was the first grass tune-up ahead of Wimbledon he had played since 2010. Djokovic went on to win the event with four straight-sets wins.\nWimbledon.\nDjokovic beat Martin Kližan, Adam Pavlásek and Ernests Gulbis in the first three rounds without dropping a set. In his 4th round match with Adrian Mannarino, both players were forced to move the match to the next day due to a five set battle between Rafael Nadal and Gilles Müller, which ended with less than one hour of playable daylight on a then roofless No. 1 Court, meaning that after beating Mannarino in three sets, Novak had less time to recover for the upcoming quarterfinal match against Tomáš Berdych. Fighting with persisting right elbow problems, he criticized Wimbledon organisers for delaying his 4R match instead of moving it to Centre Court. The next day he retired against Tomáš Berdych while down 6–7, 0–2, due to an elbow injury.\nInjury hiatus.\nOn July 27, Djokovic announced he would be missing the rest of the season to recover from a persistent injury on his right elbow.\nMissing the last four months of the season, Djokovic saw his ranking drop to 12th, the lowest since 2007. This had been the first time Djokovic had to miss a Grand Slam since his first appearance in 2005.\nAll matches.\nThis table lists all the matches of Djokovic this year, including walkovers W/O (they are marked ND for non-decision)\nSingles.\n \n \n \nDoubles.\n \n \nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nNovak Djokovic had a record against the top 10, against the \"top 11–50\", against other players; against right-handed players and against left-handed players.\n\"Ordered by number of wins\" ."

        "text": "The Ivy League women's basketball tournament is the conference tournament in basketball for the Ivy League, and is held alongside the Ivy League men's tournament at the same venue. The overall event is currently marketed as Ivy Madness. As with the men's tournament, the women's event is a single-elimination tournament involving the top four schools in the standings. The tournament format consists of two semifinal games on the first day (Saturday), with the No. 1 seed playing the No. 4 seed and the No. 2 seed playing the No. 3 seed, followed by the championship game played the next day (Sunday). The tournament winner receives the League's automatic bids to the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. The teams that finish with the best records from the 14-game, regular-season conference schedule will continue to be recognized as Ivy League champions.\nUnlike the men's Ivy tournament, in which the regular-season champion receives an automatic berth in the National Invitation Tournament should it fail to win the conference tournament, a women's regular-season champion is technically not guaranteed a postseason berth if it does not make the NCAA tournament. However, the Women's National Invitation Tournament has a standing policy of inviting the top available team from each NCAA Division I conference once the NCAA women's tournament field has been set. (This difference is because unlike the men's NIT, the WNIT is neither owned nor operated by the NCAA.)\nPrior to the formal tournament, the Ivy League used a one-game playoff if necessary to break ties eight times with two teams, and in 2001-02, a three-team tournament, in order to settle the conference championship.\nThe first two tournaments in 2017 and 2018 were held at the Palestra on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. The 2019 event was held at John J. Lee Amphitheater, a venue located within Yale University's Payne Whitney Gymnasium. In 2019, the Ivy League announced that the men's and women's tournaments would rotate among the remaining conference members through 2025. Due to COVID-19 disruptions, the 2020 tournament was canceled, and the Ivy League did not play a 2020–21 season. The tournament resumed in 2022, with all venues shifted forward by two years.\nList of regular season champions.\nSince 1974, the Ivy League has had regular season titles for women's basketball.\nReferences.\n "

        "text": "Alfred Ernest 'Cap' McDonald (September 17, 1877 – May 1, 1956) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played from 1895 to 1914. In 1912–13, he was the captain and coach of the Sydney Millionaires when they played against the Quebec Bulldogs for the Stanley Cup in 1913.\nBiography.\nMcDonald was from the village of Iroquois, Ontario, and was the son of the Village Chief of Police, William McDonald. He left home at an early age in 1896 to play for the Smiths Falls Hockey Club until 1902. Interrupted briefly in 1898 when he played for Brockville.\nIt was during this period, on March 27, 1899, that Alfred broke the world record for high jumping on skates, having leaped 42 &amp; ½ inches high.\nAs with most early professional hockey players, he moved often from team to team within Canada and the United States. Players were paid by the game, or by the hockey season. Often players, termed \"ringers\", were hired to play specific games or series of games when teams were vying for championships in their league.\nAt that time, hockey was played with six men on the ice in addition to a goalkeeper. McDonald, noted to be a tall and husky person, played all positions except goalkeeper during his long hockey career. He was particularly effective at the 'point' and 'cover-point' positions which evolved in to the 'defenceman' position of modern style of hockey.\nDuring this era, teams based in Canada did not pay their hockey players. Rather, the hockey town provided off-ice jobs and other perks. It wasn't until the formation of the Ontario Professional Hockey League (OPHL) in 1908 that professional hockey arrived in Canada.\nThe world's first professional hockey leagues, which operated simultaneously, were the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL) and the International Professional Hockey League (IPHL), which started in 1902 and 1904 respectively, and McDonald moved to the United States to play in both leagues.\nMany good Canadian hockey players were lured down to play in both the WPHL and the IPHL. Players were provided with accommodation and transportation and paid on average US$30 per game, .\nBetween 1905 and 1909, McDonald moved from team to team in the IPHL and WPHL. Players were paid on an individual contract per game in most instances. The Calumet Miners (1905–1907), Pittsburgh Bankers (1907–1908), and the Pittsburgh Lyceum (1907–09) were the three main teams that McDonald rotated in and out of player contracts with.\nWhen the OPHL formed in 1908, professional hockey was gaining popularity in Canadian cities and many of the Canadian players in the WPHL and IPHL returned to Canada to play. McDonald was one of the players who was brought up from the United States to play for the famed Toronto Professionals in 1908. This is considered the first iteration of the current NHL team, the Toronto Maple Leafs.\nBy the 1908–09 season, McDonald was playing for the Brantford Braves (also known as the Brantford Indians) and it was with this team that he played three full seasons.\nIn two of his three last years of playing professional hockey he was the captain of the Sydney Millionaires in the Maritime Professional Hockey League (MPHL).\nList of teams that Alfred 'Cap' McDonald played for.\nCap’ played in three amateur hockey leagues: \n1896-1900 Iroquois Indians Hockey Club Ontario Hockey Association Seniors (OHAS) \n1901-1902 Smith’s Falls Hockey Club Upper Ottawa Valley Hockey League (UOVHL) \n1902-1903 Smith’s Falls Hockey Club OHAS \n1903-1904 Smith’s Falls Hockey Club OHAS \n1903-1904 Brockville Hockey Club OHAS \n1905-1906 Cornwall Hockey Club Federal Hockey League (FHL)\nIn 1905 Cap decided to become a professional hockey player, however there were no professional teams in Canada, so he went to the United States. \nHe played on the following professional teams and leagues: \n1905-1906 Michigan Soo Indians International Hockey League (IHL) \n1905-1906 Calumet Miners IHL 1906-1907 Calumet Miners IHL \n1907-1908 Pittsburgh Lyceum Western Professional Hockey League (WPHL) \n1907-1908 Pittsburgh Bankers WPHL \n1907-1908 Brantford Indians Ontario Professional Hockey League (OPHL) \n1908-1909 Brantford Indians OPHL \n1908-1909 Pittsburgh Lyceum WPHL \n1908-1909 Toronto Professionals OPHL \n1909-1910 Waterloo Colts OPHL \n1909-1910 Galt Professionals OPHL \n1910 Galt Professionals OPHL – Stanley Cup Challenge against Ottawa Senators \n1910-1911 Belleville Eastern Ontario Professional Hockey League (EOPHL) \n1910-1911 Brantford Indians OPHL \n1911-1912 Montreal Shamrocks Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union (IAHU) \n1912-1913 Montreal St. Pats IAHU \n1912-1913 Sydney Millionaires MPHL \n1913 Sydney Millionaires MPHL – Stanley Cup Challenge against Quebec Bulldogs \n1913-1914 Montreal Wanderers National Hockey Association (NHA"

In 1979, Fogel joined Jim Calhoun's staff at Northeastern, and was a part of five NCAA Tournament appearances, as well as six regular season conference titles before taking over the head coaching position when Calhoun left for Connecticut. In his first season at the helm, Fogel coached the Reggie Lewis-led Huskies to a 27–7 record an ECAC North regular season and tournament title, and a bid to the 1987 NCAA tournament. Fogel became the first coach in conference history to win the conference tournament and go to the NCAA tournament in his first season on the job. \nIn his next four seasons at Northeastern, Fogel guided the Huskies to a winning record, including a regular season title during the 1989-90 season, and a regular season and conference tournament title in 1990–91 and an appearance in the 1991 NCAA tournament. In the three seasons that followed, Fogel's record was 34–49 and was subsequently fired and replaced by Northeastern alum Dave Leitao.\nAfter Northeastern, Fogel became the head coach at Mercyhurst, where he stayed until 2003, accumulating an overall record of 106–106. \nUpon leaving coaching, Fogel became the athletic director at Westwood High School in Massachusetts, serving in the role until 2011 after being placed on administrative leave following an incident involving the firing of the school's track and field coach.

        "text": "The Iowa State Cyclones women's swimming and diving team represents Iowa State University (ISU) and competes in the Big 12 Conference of NCAA Division I. The team is coached by Duane Sorenson, who has led Iowa State since the 1997-98 season. The Cyclones host their home meets at Beyer Pool on Iowa State's campus.\nHistory.\nIowa State first had club swim teams dating back to the 1920s but first put together a varsity squad for the 1970–71 year. They were able to capture their first Big Eight Title in 1974 under coach Deidre Singleton.\nHead Coach Ramsey Van Horn was hired in 1979 to lead the Cyclones. Iowa State experienced a considerable amount of individual success under Ramsey including 15 All-Americans and 21 Conference Champions. Ramsey was let go in 1997.\nDuane Sorenson has been the head coach since the 1997-98 season. He is assisted by Jeff Warrick who is a diving specialist.\nFacilities.\nBeyer Hall Pool is the site of Cyclone home swimming meets. The facility houses a six-lane, T-shaped, 25-yard competitive pool with an attached diving well. The pool has permanent spectator seating for approximately 800 people. The competitive pool has a variable depth bottom and turbulence reducing gutters. Beyer pool is also equipped with a Colorado electronic timing system and a seven-line scoreboard display. Underwater viewing windows aid the coaching staff with stroke correction and videotape stroke analysis.\nBeyer’s diving well has two 1-meter diving boards, two 3-meter diving boards and a 5-meter platform. The 5-meter platform and 1-meter diving boards are on concrete stands. The 3-meter boards are on Durafirm stands and all diving boards are Maxiflex model “B” springboards. Next to the diving well are a trampoline and a dry-board that is fully equipped with a spotting rig designed to help divers learn and perfect somersaulting and twisting dives. The pool also has two TIVO video systems that capture dives off each board and platform allowing divers to quickly view the dive they just performed.\nBeyer has been the home of the 1962 and 1971 NCAA meets as well as numerous conference championships."

The competition is sponsored and broadcast by Dialog TV.\nThe league consists of 8 clubs playing in a home-and-away double round robin. The standings at the end of the season determine the seedings for the 2017 edition of the Clifford Cup playoffs held in the spring.\nThe reigning champions of both last year's regular season and the 2016 Clifford Cup is Kandy SC, who claimed their 17th league title after finishing the 2015-2016 season undefeated, two games clear of runners up Havelock SC.\nThe 2016-17 season was the first season that the SLRFU introduced a Television Match Official (TMO) for selected domestic games.\nKandy SC began the season in dominant form defeating CH&amp;FC 96 to nil in their opening game before losing to Air Force SC the following week in a close game 24 to 21. Before the mid season break at the end of the year Kandy SC lost a second game, this time to Navy SC 32-37. Havelock SC commenced the year with a six-game winning streak, which ended with a 30-39 loss to Kandy SC on 18 December 2016.\nIn the second half of the season both Kandy SC and Havelock SC continued their respective unbeaten runs, with the title race coming down to the second last game of the season. The resultant win by Kandy SC 26-11 virtually secured the club the title, as whilst both clubs have the same number of wins for the season Kandy SC have more bonus points due to the size of their winning margins over the season. In the final round of the season Kandy SC finished in the same manner as they started by comprehensively defeating CH&amp;FC 59-3, thereby retaining their League title for the 3rd year in a row.\nLeague table.\nTable standings updated through 12 February 2017"

        "text": "The 2016 FIFA Club World Cup final was the final match of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup, an association football tournament hosted by Japan. It was the 13th final of the FIFA Club World Cup, a FIFA-organised tournament between the winners of the six continental confederations, as well as the host nation's league champions.\nThe final was contested between Spanish club Real Madrid, representing UEFA as the reigning champions of the UEFA Champions League, and Japanese club Kashima Antlers, representing the host country as the reigning champions of the J1 League. It was the first time a team from Asia played in the final. The match was played at the International Stadium Yokohama in Yokohama on 18 December 2016.\nReal Madrid won the match 4–2 after extra time to claim their 2nd title.\nBackground.\nKashima Antlers became the first Asian club to reach the FIFA Club World Cup final. It was also the first time that an Asian club won against a South American side in the history of the competition, and the third time that South American champions failed to qualify for the final, after the 2010 and 2013 editions.\nFor Real Madrid, the match was their second final, after having won the 2014 final. This was the 12th time in 13 tournaments in which a European team made it to the final.\nRoute to the final.\nReal Madrid.\nReal Madrid entered the competition in the semi-finals, facing Mexican side and CONCACAF Champions League winners América. Karim Benzema opened the scoring for Real in first half stoppage time, putting them ahead at the break. Cristiano Ronaldo secured the 2–0 victory and final spot for \"Los Blancos\" with a goal in second half stoppage time.\nKashima Antlers.\nKashima Antlers started the tournament in the quarter-final play-off, facing New Zealand side Auckland City, winners of the OFC Champions League. Auckland opened the scoring via a goal from Kim Dae-wook in the 50th minute. Seventeen minutes later, Shuhei Akasaki equalised for the hosts. With two minutes remaining, Mu Kanazaki grabbed the late winner, sending Kashima through to the quarter-finals with a 2–1 win.\nIn the quarter-finals, \"the Antlers\" faced the CAF Champions League winners and South African champions Mamelodi Sundowns. Yasushi Endo opened the scoring in the 63rd minute to put Kashima ahead, before Shuhei Akasaki once again scored with two minutes remaining to secure the 2–0 win and semi-final spot.\nIn the semi-finals, Kashima met the Copa Libertadores winners, Atlético Nacional of Colombia. In the 33rd minute, Hungarian referee Viktor Kassai awarded a historic penalty to Kashima. This was the first time that the video assistant referee (VAR) system was used to award a penalty in football, following a video replay review by Kassai. The review was initiated after Kassai received information from Dutchman Danny Makkelie about a missed incident in Atlético Nacional's penalty box. Shoma Doi then successfully converted the penalty to put Kashima ahead at the interval. Yasushi Endo extended their lead in the 83rd minute, before Yuma Suzuki scored two minutes later, wrapping up the 3–0 win for Kashima and sending them through to the final.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nReal Madrid centre-forward Karim Benzema opened the scoring in the ninth minute with a right foot shot from seven yards out after an initial shot from Luka Modrić was saved by Hitoshi Sogahata with the rebound coming straight back to Benzema. Gaku Shibasaki equalised for Kashima Antlers shortly before the interval with a low left footed shot from six yards out to the right corner of the net. In the 52nd minute, Shibasaki scored his second to put Kashima ahead with a low left foot shot from outside the penalty box that skimmed past Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas and into the left corner of the net. In the sixtieth minute, Antlers defender Shuto Yamamoto fouled Real forward Lucas Vázquez in the box, resulting in a penalty awarded to Madrid. Forward Cristiano Ronaldo converted the spot kick shooting low to his left to equalise for the European champions. Both sides had additional opportunities to score, but with no further goals in regulation, the match went to extra time.\nIn the 98th minute, Ronaldo scored his second goal of the match to put Real Madrid ahead once again with a low left-footed shot from inside the penalty box which went under the goalkeeper, following a through ball by Benzema. In the final minute of the first half of extra time, Ronaldo completed his hat-trick for Real Madrid with a left-footed shot from the center of the box into the roof of the net, following a pass from Toni Kroos. The hat-trick goal sealed the 4–2 win for Real, giving them their second Club World Cup title in three years.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nThe win gave Real their second Club World title, after winning the 2014 edition. The title was Real's third of 2016, following victories in the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League and 2016 UEFA Super Cup. With his final hat-trick, Cristiano Ronaldo was named the man of the match. He also finished as the tournament's top scorer, with four goals. Additionally, he was awarded the adidas Golden Ball for best player of the tournament. Teammate Luka Modrić came in second, receiving the Silver Ball. Kashima midfielder Gaku Shibasaki came in third, and was given the Bronze Ball following his brace in the final. Kashima Antlers were also awarded the fair play award with the best fair play record during the tournament.\nFollowing the match, Real manager Zinedine Zidane commented on the victory, saying: \"We knew that this final would not be an easy one. They ran. They fought. I think there are several players from Kashima that could play in La Liga. The fact that we were able to be here and win, we're very happy. To be able to take the Club World Cup back home with us makes us very happy.\" Kashima manager Masatada Ishii stated that \"For us to be able to come so far is meaningful. It really means that Japanese football, in a very short period of time, has come up to a world-class level.\""

        "text": "Kyle Edward Keller (born January 16, 1968) is an American basketball coach, currently the head coach for the Stephen F. Austin Lumberjacks men's basketball team. Previously, he served as an assistant coach at Texas A&amp;M, Kansas, Oklahoma State, UTSA, Louisiana Tech and head coach at Tyler Junior College.\nEarly coaching career.\nKeller started his coaching career as an assistant at Louisiana Tech. After a four-year stint, Keller joined the staff at Tyler Junior College before taking a position as an assistant at Texas-San Antonio for one season. In 1997, Keller returned to Tyler Junior College and accepted his first head coaching job. Keller joined the staff of head coach Eddie Sutton at Oklahoma State in 1999, where he would remain until 2008. Keller's time in Stillwater was marred by the plane crash that killed 10 players and staffers in early 2001, including Keller's cousin, Nate Fleming, who replaced Keller on the plane during a last-minute switch. Keller's experience and that of Fleming's family in the aftermath of the crash was documented by ESPN's \"Outside the Lines\" in 2011. Following the resignation of then-head coach Sean Sutton in 2008, Keller relocated to Kansas where he served as an assistant to Bill Self. After three seasons, Keller became an assistant to Billy Kennedy at Texas A&amp;M. In 2016, Keller accepted the head coaching position at Stephen F. Austin following the departure of Brad Underwood to Oklahoma State.\nHead coaching career.\nStephen F. Austin.\nOn April 4, 2016, Keller was hired as the head coach at Stephen F. Austin. He replaced Brad Underwood who left after 3 seasons to become the head coach at Oklahoma State. SFA athletic director Robert Hill said in a statement, \"Kyle brings a wealth of experience having worked for great coaches like Eddie Sutton, Bill Self and Billy Kennedy. This experience will fit well to continue our SFA basketball culture of winning championships and making NCAA tournament appearances. He cares deeply for his players and is a wonderful husband and father. We are so happy he has agreed to become a Lumberjack. I look forward to having our fans and students get to know him.\"\nKeller won his first game as a Division I head coach against the Longwood Lancers on November 15, 2016. Keller led Stephen F. Austin to an 18–15 record in his first season. In 2017–18, Stephen F. Austin finished 28–7, won the 2018 Southland tournament as the no. 3 seed, and appeared in the NCAA tournament. Keller reached 100 wins on February 11, 2021, making him the fastest coach at SFA to reach this milestone.\nKeller is known for his stifling, unique defense. SFA led the nation in forced turnovers and steals in 2018 AND 2020 and are on pace to end 2021 in the top 15. In 2020, SFA was top 10 in the nation in 8 categories. In 2021, SFA is 2nd in the nation with field-goal percentage, and is Top 10 in the nation in categories.\nOn November 26, 2019, Stephen F. Austin upset no. 1 Duke 85–83 in overtime, giving Duke their first non-conference home loss in 150 games. Stephen F. Austin finished the 2019–20 season with a 28–3 (19–1 Southland) record and the regular season Southland title. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Southland and NCAA tournaments were cancelled. He also led the team to two other Power 5 victories, 59-58 vs Baylor and 83-82 over LSU.\nFollowing the discovery of an administrative error in declaring student-athletes eligible, on May 20, 2020, Stephen F. Austin reached an agreement with the NCAA to vacate hundreds of wins across multiple sports from 2013 to 2019, including all 117 men's basketball wins from the 2014–15 to 2018–19 seasons.\nIn 2021-2022, SFA were co-champions in the WAC. Kyle Keller is currently the 19th most winning basketball coach in all the NCAA of coaches that have been a head coach for a minimum of 4 years. \nPersonal.\nA native of Dallas, Texas, Keller attended Oklahoma State University where he played baseball. He is married to Chaunsea Keller and has two children: Kenzie and Kemper."

        "text": "Adam Brooks (born May 6, 1996) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre currently playing for the Lehigh Valley Phantoms in the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the fourth-round, 92nd overall, by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nWhile playing AAA hockey for the Winnipeg Hawks, both Brooks and his older brother Brett attended West Kildonan Collegiate. Brooks ended the season being named AAA Impact Player of the Year and MVP.\nBrooks was selected 25th overall by the Regina Pats in the 2011 Western Hockey League (WHL) draft after recording 111 points with the Winnipeg Hawks. He signed with the Pats on August 24, 2011, but was reassigned to the Winnipeg Thrashers in the Manitoba U-18 'AAA' Hockey League. While with the Thrashers, Brooks was selected to play for Team Canada at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics in Innsbruck Austria. At the conclusion of the 2011–12 season, Brooks recorded 41 points in 37 games, and appeared in the Western Canada Under-16 Challenge.\nAfter only recording 11 points during the 2013–14 season, Brooks was passed over in his first year of eligibility for the NHL Entry Draft. Prior to the beginning of the new season, the Pats hired Dave Struch and Brooks excelled that season, recording 62 points in 64 games. Despite going undrafted again, Brooks partook in the New York Rangers rookie camp.\nHis success continued into the following season where Brooks lead the league with 82 assists and 120 points, which earned him the Bob Clarke Trophy. This also earned him a 72nd final ranking from the NHL Central Scouting Bureau amongst North American skaters. By the time the 2016 NHL Entry Draft came around, Brooks was drafted 92nd overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs. Brooks was named team captain of the Pats to start his final junior year in the 2016–17 WHL season. Although the Pats qualified for the playoffs, Brooks injured his knee in Game 2 of an Eastern Conference semi-final and was out for the rest of the series. At the conclusion of his junior career, Brooks ranked third all-time in regular-season games played with 317, 10th in career points with 335, and sixth in assists with 216. He was also named to the WHL First All-Star team.\nProfessional.\nOn June 29, 2017, Brooks was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. After attending the Leafs training camp, Brooks was reassigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies, to begin the 2017–18 season. Brooks played on a line with Ben Smith and Colin Greening, whom helped him record his first career AHL point in a 4–0 win over the Charlotte Checkers. He later scored his first career AHL goal in a 5–1 win over the Belleville Senators on December 31, 2017. Brooks finished his rookie campaign with the Marlies recording 19 points in 57 regular AHL games, and six points in 20 playoff games to help lead the Marlies to their first Calder Cup in franchise history.\nAfter attending the Leafs training camp, Brooks was reassigned to the Marlies for the 2018–19 AHL season. The Marlies qualified for the 2019 Calder Cup playoffs, where Brooks recorded a hat trick to sweep the Marlies past the Rochester Americans. Brooks played his first NHL game against the New York Rangers on December 28, 2019. Brooks finished the season with 3 points in 7 games with the Maple Leafs and 9 goals and 20 points in 29 games for the Marlies. He re-signed with the Maple Leafs to a two-year, two-way contract in May 2020. On January 22, 2021, Brooks scored his first NHL goal with the Maple Leafs on Mikko Koskinen of the Edmonton Oilers. He finished the season with 5 points in 11 games with the Maple Leafs.\nOn October 10, 2021, prior to the season, Brooks was placed on waivers by the Maple Leafs as part of pre-season roster cuts. He was subsequently claimed by the Montreal Canadiens the following day. He appeared in four games with the Canadiens. Brooks was placed back on waivers by Montreal on November 16, 2021; the following day, he was claimed by the Vegas Golden Knights. Brooks played in seven games for the Golden Knights, scoring two goals. On February 15, 2022, Brooks was placed on waivers by the Golden Knights, and subsequently re-claimed by Toronto the next day. However, on February 17, Toronto placed Brooks on waivers again; the following day, he was claimed by the Winnipeg Jets. He finished the season with 14 games played for the Jets.\nOn July 13, 2022, Brooks was signed as a free agent to a two-year, two-way contract with the Philadelphia Flyers."

        "text": "This event was held on 29 January 2017 as part of the 2017 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships in Belvaux, Luxembourg. Participants must be men born in 1994 or before. It was won by Wout van Aert of Belgium.\nRace report.\nWout van Aert and Mathieu van der Poel were the big favourites before the race, having dominated the whole season and dividing the majority of races between them.\nIn contrast to the previous races, snow and ice were much less and the track had become much more muddy and therefore slower. As a result, several rocks surfaced which were barely visible and often covered in small pools of water. The race would turn out to become tough on the material, with especially flat tyres playing a deciding role.\nJust after the start, Belgian Tom Meeusen broke his bicycle at the first obstacle and was forced to retire immediately. Meanwhile, van der Poel immediately raced away from the pack with only Kevin Pauwels able to follow. A chase group involved van Aert, Tim Merlier, Michael Vanthourenhout, Corné van Kessel, Stan Godrie, Clément Venturini and Lars van der Haar already 15 seconds back after the first lap. A puncture by Pauwels caused him to drop back, leaving van der Poel going solo from lap two. In the chasing group several riders also suffered multiple punctures and dropped back, with only van Aert able to remain about ten seconds behind.\nVan der Poel suffered successive punctures on laps 2, 3 and 4 but each time closely before the pit lane, not losing much time but allowing van Aert to close the gap each lap, finally getting back together on lap 4. Behind the two leaders the gap kept widening, however the first chaser changed often as punctures caused many riders to drop back from a good position. Several riders suffered several punctures and some riders even dropped out of the race as they ran out of spare tyres, including 2008 World Champion Lars Boom.\nThe two leaders remained together until lap 6 when disaster struck for van der Poel as he suffered a puncture a long distance from the pits, causing him to lose 30 seconds on van Aert. Van Aert now only needed to avoid punctures in the last three laps to win his second consecutive world title, in which he succeeded. As the other riders were already over a minute back, van der Poel had no problem securing second but was visibly disappointed with his second place and eventually finished in tears 44 seconds behind van Aert.\nIn the fight for third, over two minutes behind van Aert, Pauwels was able to overtake van der Haar on the final lap to take his fifth bronze medal at the UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships following earlier third places in 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2016."

The origin of the club is unknown, but it is locally believed that Ticknall's relationship with cricket began in the mid-19th century.\nGround.\nTicknall's main ground is the Grange, a picturesque ground on Repton Road in Ticknall, which includes a two-lane all-weather net facility. Their second ground is at the old Woodville Cricket ground, on Burton Road, Derbyshire. The 1st and 2nd XI teams use the Grange, rated by the DCCL as a Grade A+ ground, and the 3rd XI use the Woodville ground, rated as a Grade C ground by the DCCL.\nHistory.\nIt is not known when the club was established, but local knowledge believe it to be around 1850. The earliest known cricket ground used by Ticknell was in the field adjacent to the current ground on Repton Road. One of the earliest records show Ticknall winning the Burton and District Cricket League in 1910. The club moved to their current ground, the Grange, in 1921. After a break during the Second World War, the club resumed activity playing friendly matches, until catastrophe hit the club when their wooden pavilion was destroyed by fire at the beginning of the cricket season in 1968. The club had no option but to use the garage next to the church as a changing room, and host teas in the local pub. The club entered the Derby and District Cricket League in 1971 and by the early 1980s, Ticknall fielded their first junior team, establishing the birth of a successful junior section that thrives today. It was during this time that the club was then able to field a second XI team, enabling the club to join the Central Derbyshire League in 1984, winning the league championship in 1987. In 1992, the club joined the Derbyshire County Cricket League, where it still plays today. The ground, overlooked by the village church, and graced with a new pavilion, built in 2000, is considered by many as one of the prettiest grounds in Derbyshire.\nThe Club currently has three senior teams competing in the Derbyshire County Cricket League, a Friendly XI team, and a long established and very successful junior training section that play competitive cricket in the South Derbyshire Development Group.\nClub Performance.\nThe Derbyshire County Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 1999."

        "title": "Kent County Cricket Club in 2017",
        "text": "In 2017, Kent County Cricket Club competed in Division Two of the County Championship, the Royal London One-Day Cup and the NatWest t20 Blast. In addition, before the start of the English cricket season, Kent competed in the 2016–17 Regional Super50, the List A competition of the West Indian domestic season. This was the first time that any English county had competed in an overseas domestic competition. The invitation to take part in the tournament was largely due to the influence of former West Indian captain Jimmy Adams who had been Kent's Head Coach until September 2016.\nThe season was the first in charge for new head coach and former player, Matthew Walker. Former South African fast-bowler Allan Donald was announced as the new assistant coach, but his arrival was delayed while he worked towards the ECB level three qualification he required to gain the visa necessary to take up the role. Former Yorkshire coach, and Australia fast-bowler, Jason Gillespie was appointed as assistant coach on an interim basis for the first few weeks of the season. It was later announced that Donald would not be joining up with Kent until 2018. Sam Northeast retained the club captaincy for a second season.\nJoe Denly won the club's Player of the Year award, having scored over 1,895 runs across all formats.\nSquad.\nDepartures.\nFast bowler David Griffiths left the club at the end of his contract in September 2016 after three seasons with Kent and academy graduate Sam Weller left without having played for the first XI (he had played 6 First Class matches for Oxford MCCU during his time with Kent).\nHardus Viljoen, who had a brief spell with Kent as an overseas player at the end of the 2016 season, signed a Kolpak deal with Derbyshire. Reports suggest that Kent had first refusal on signing Viljoen, but opted not to match Derbyshire's offer.\nOn the eve of the season Fabian Cowdrey left the club by mutual consent to pursue opportunities outside of cricket.\nAdam Ball, Hugh Bernard and Charlie Hartley were released by Kent at the end of the season. Matt Coles also left his home county to join county champions Essex in October.\nArrivals.\nHaving impressed while on loan at the county in 2016, Will Gidman signed a permanent contract with Kent in October 2016 after he was released by Nottinghamshire. Academy wicket-keeper Ollie Robinson made his senior debut for the county in the final match of the 2016–17 Regional Super50 tournament after being called into the touring squad as cover for Adam Rouse with Sam Billings away on England duty. Robinson went on to sign his first professional contract with the club at the end of the season. In March, Kent announced the signing of former England Under 19 captain Joe Weatherley on loan from Hampshire for the 2017 season, although he stayed with the county only for the first half of the season. Middlesex fast bowler James Harris followed as another loan signing in early April, initially for the first three County Championship matches and the first section of the 2017 Royal London One-Day Cup.\nOn 10 April, Kent announced the signing of South African international left-arm fast bowler Wayne Parnell, who had previously played for the county during the 2009 season, as an overseas player on a short-term contract. Parnell was available to play in the County Championship and Royal London One-Day Cup until he joined up with the South African national team when they began their tour of England in May. New Zealand fast bowler Adam Milne joined the team as an overseas player for the second half of the season after the conclusion of the ICC Champions Trophy that took place in England and Wales during the first half of June and Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah played two County Championship games during the middle of the season. Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham played in the T20 Blast campaign alongside Milne.\nAustralian-born fast-bowling all-rounder Grant Stewart signed his first professional contract with Kent at the end of August after impressing while on trial with the second XI as well as in the Kent Premier League with Sandwich Town. He holds an EU passport through his Italian mother and was not classed as an overseas player.\nRegional Super50.\nAt the beginning of the year, Kent competed in the 2016–17 Regional Super50, a List A tournament that is part of the West Indian domestic season, after accepting an invitation from the West Indies Cricket Board. The competition took place between 24 January and 18 February. It was the first time that Kent had competed in an overseas competition.\nKent were drawn in Group A, and played two matches against each of the other teams in the group: Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, Windward Islands and the West Indies under-19 cricket team. Group B included the other three regular teams of West Indian domestic cricket (Barbados, Guyana and Jamaica) and two development sides (Combined Campuses and Colleges and ICC Americas).\nKent began the tournament with a seven wicket loss to the Leeward islands at the Coolidge Cricket Ground in Antigua before consecutive wins against Trinidad and Tobago and Windward Islands. Four consecutive losses saw the county knocked out of the tournament at the group stage before a win in their final match of the competition. The tournament was viewed by Kent as an opportunity for warm weather preparation for the English domestic season.\nCounty Championship.\nKent played 14 County Championship Division Two matches in 2017. The Championship was restructured for 2017, with Division Two having ten teams, leaving the remaining eight counties in Division One instead of the previous nine-nine split. Teams in both divisions played fewer matches than in 2016 (14 instead of 16), meaning that teams in Division Two played five of their rivals twice and the other four teams only once during the season.\nKent's opening fixture was at home against Gloucestershire, starting on 7 April at the St Lawrence Ground, a match they won by 334 runs after bowling Gloucestershire out for a total of 61 in their second innings with Darren Stevens taking 6/22. They played seven home matches in total, five at the St Lawrence Ground and one each at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells and the County Cricket Ground, Beckenham. One fixture, an away game against Nottinghamshire, was a day–night match, part of an experiment by the England and Wales Cricket Board ahead of the staging of the first UK day–night Test match in August.\nKent started strongly, winning four of their first five matches. However, in a frustrating remainder of the season they failed to win any further matches in the championship and slipped to 5th place in the table. One match, against Derbyshire at Queen's Park, Chesterfield in September, was abandoned as a draw without a ball being bowled due to heavy rain and a wet outfield. As a result the team only played 13 of the scheduled 14 matches.\nOther first-class matches.\nKent began the 2017 English cricket season with a three-day University match against Leeds/Bradford MCC University on 28 March and played a three-day match against the touring West Indians at the beginning of August. The fixture against the West Indians formed the centre-piece of the 166th Canterbury Cricket Week.\nRoyal London One-Day Cup.\nKent competed in the South group of the 2017 Royal London One-Day Cup. They played each of the other eight teams in the group once, with all four home games being played at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury. A disappointing campaign saw Kent finish bottom of the table, with just a single win against Middlesex. After an early elimination, the starting eleven increasingly featured fringe squad players, particularly in the bowling department, and academy graduate batsman Zak Crawley made his senior debut in the final match against Essex.\nDaniel Bell-Drummond had a good tournament, scoring successive centuries against Somerset and Sussex, as well as two half centuries. Alex Blake also scored a century against Somerset, his first in List A cricket, reaching 116 from just 58 balls. Darren Stevens, on his 300th List A appearance, scored a career-high 147 from just 67 deliveries (including 10 fours and 14 sixes) against Glamorgan at Swansea, almost leading Kent to an unlikely victory and setting a new record for Kent's highest individual score in List A cricket.\nNatWest t20 Blast.\nKent played in the South group of the 2017 NatWest t20 Blast. The county played 14 matches, facing each team in the group at least once. They played seven home matches, one at County Cricket Ground, Beckenham and the other six at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury. In a very tight group, Kent went into the final game against Surrey needing a win to progress to the quarter-finals, but lost by 10 runs.\nJoe Denly scored two hundreds during the campaign. In a memorable match at The Oval against Surrey he scored 166 not out as Kent chased a total of 205 to win by eight wickets. Later in the tournament he scored 127 against Essex County Cricket Club at County Ground, Chelmsford as part of a first-wicket stand of 207 runs with Daniel Bell-Drummond. This set records for Kent's Twenty20 highest individual score and partnership and, as of the end of the season, was the highest partnership score for any wicket in T20 cricket in the UK, the third highest anywhere in the world and was a world record for the first wicket.\nAdam Milne took five wickets in the fixture against Somerset and recorded Kent's best bowling figures in Twenty20 cricket with 5/11.\nStatistics.\nBatting.\nSource: Cricinfo\nBowling.\nSource: CricInfo"

        "text": "The National Baseball Congress World Series or NBC World Series is an annual, collegiate and semi-pro baseball tournament held in Wichita, Kansas. Satchel Paige, Don Sutton, Tom Seaver, Ozzie Smith, Tony Gwynn, Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens are just a few of the Major League Baseball stars that have played in the tournament.\nWhen the national tournament started in 1935, participants were primarily town teams and industrial teams. Team rosters featured aging, former minor league and major league ballplayers and players ineligible for major league baseball. In the mid-1960s team rosters transitioned to collegiate players, including prospects on the fast path to the major leagues. In 1975, the NBC World Series began recognizing a tournament participant who went on to a major league career as Graduate of the Year.\nThe first NBC World Series called the \"Little World Series\" was held August 13–27, 1935 at Lawrence Stadium in Wichita. National Baseball Congress founder, Hap Dumont, was director of the National Tournament Committee of Wichita that put on the tournament. Thirty-two teams were invited to the first national tournament. A focus was put on diversity with five teams classified as \"integrated\", one team consisted of Native American players and another of Japanese players.\nFuture Baseball Hall of Famer, Satchel Paige, was signed to a $1,000 personal appearance contract for the 1935 tournament. A victim of the baseball color barrier, Paige was not eligible to play minor league or major league baseball. Paige won four games, striking out 60 batters while leading the Bismarck Churchills to the first NBC World Series championship. He was named MVP of the tournament.\nDumont recruited Baseball Hall of Fame member Honus Wagner as the guest of honor at the 1935 opening night banquet. In addition to Wagner, celebrity guests that have been honored at the opening night banquet include: Stan Musial, Mickey Mantle, Dizzy Dean, Connie Mack, Allie Reynolds, Fred Clarke and Rin Tin Tin.\nTeams bolstered by military service players dominated the WWII (1943–1945) and Korean War (1952–1955) tournaments. During these eras, major league players were serving at military bases across the country and playing for the base teams. 1953 World Series MVP Billy Martin played in the 1954 NBC World Series with the Goodland, Kansas Tigers. A new rule making major league \"name\" stars unavailable in National Baseball Congress tournaments was implemented following the 1955 NBC World Series.\nNBC Champions.\nNBC World Series Champions and MVPs.\nNBC Graduate of the Year.\nSince 1975 the NBC World Series has recognized a former participant as \"Graduate of the Year\".\nHistory.\nFounder.\nFounder Raymond Harry \"Hap\" Dumont (1904–1971) spent his career working in sports. Early in life, he was a sports editor for newspapers in Wichita and Hutchinson. He also promoted boxing and wrestling matches. When the opportunity arose, he sold sporting equipment, succeeding in the mail-order business even as the great depression lingered.\nDumont got his start promoting baseball with a game between circus clowns and firemen in 1925. Kansas had blue laws at the time that limited business activities on Sundays; that included the circus but not baseball. Sparks Bros Circus clowns and roustabouts inquired about playing a local baseball team to earn some extra money on their day off. Dumont setup the game at Island Park located on Ackerman Island in Wichita. Abe Goldstein, a famous clown, performed on the field and in the stands. The clowns did not provide all of the tricks as the Firemen's centerfielder patrolled the outfield on the back of a motorcycle driven by a policeman. A sellout crowd of 3,500 turned out to see the game.\nIsland Park burnt down in 1933 when a cigarette ignited the wooden structure. Without a venue to host his baseball games, Dumont petitioned the city of Wichita for a W.P.A. project to construct a new stadium. He presented an idea for a national, semi-professional baseball tournament to be held in Wichita. An idea that had not occurred to Dumont prior to the conversation. Lawrence Stadium was constructed prior to the 1934 baseball season. In 1978, Lawrence Stadium was renamed Lawrence-Dumont Stadium in honor of Dumont.\nDumont continued to use gimmicks to promote his baseball tournaments. Games were held early in the morning when graveyard shifts ended. An emphasis was put on \"wumps\", women umpires. One rule allowed the batter to run to either first or third base when the bases were unoccupied. Dumont had a microphone installed at home plate. When activated the microphone would rise up from the ground, allowing arguments at the plate to be broadcast to the whole stadium. To keep games moving at a rapid pace, he implemented an air device that could dust home plate. A timer with a buzzer was installed on the outfield wall. If either team took more than 90 seconds between innings or 20 seconds between pitches, a ball or strike was awarded to penalize the offender\nIn 1945, Dumont created a national uproar with a plan for a global tournament. Just five days after Japan surrendered in World War II, Dumont announced his plan for a September tournament that would include an invitation to Japan. Dumont quickly withdrew the proposal and the tournament was not held. Five years later with the authorization of General Douglas MacArthur, the series was held in Tokyo and Osaka Japan.\nDumont died in his office on July 3, 1971 while preparing for the 1971 National Baseball Congress World Series. His wife, Anne Dumont, retained ownership of the National Baseball Congress with Larry Davis leading the organization.\nNational Baseball Congress.\nThe National Baseball Congress is best known for promoting amateur baseball games, but their reach extended beyond the games. The National Baseball Congress printed an Official Baseball Annual that included two hundred pages of rules and records. A pocket size version of baseball rules was also printed. Certification was provided for umpires, scorers and leagues through the National Baseball Congress. Player contracts were tracked via a national system to prevent \"team jumping\". The organization also sold trophies, medals, baseballs, umpire equipment and even insurance.\nWichita businessman Dee Hubbard purchased the National Baseball Congress in 1972, following the death of Hap Dumont. The organization was renamed National Baseball Congress of America.\nState Tournaments.\nIn 1931, Dumont established the Kansas Invitation Baseball Tournament to determine a semi-pro champion in the state of Kansas. Thirty-two teams were invited to the inaugural event, a single elimination tournament held at Island Park in Wichita. Abilene won the first Kansas tournament.\nAdditional state tournaments were organized in the following years, eventually including all fifty states. When the national tournament, NBC World Series, was established in 1935 the state tournament champions qualified for the national tournament.\nThe state tournaments eventually became qualifying tournaments to regional tournaments, rather than the national tournament. Regional tournament champions qualified for the national tournament.\nGlobal Tournaments.\nWith district, state, regional and a national tournament in place, Dumont set out to establish a non-professional global tournament. He started in 1939, with a seven-game series between the NBC World Series champion representing the United States and the Puerto Rico national champion from Guayama. In 1948, a Can-Am Series with Canada was billed as the Sandlot Baseball World Series. 1950 and 1952 matched the NBC World Series champion against Japan in the Inter-Hemisphere Series.\nInternational Series\nIn 1955, a non-professional Global Series was organized. Teams representing Canada, Columbia, Hawaii (a U.S. Territory until 1959), Holland, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Spain played in the eight team tournament. The NBC World Series champion represented the United States. The Global Series only lasted three seasons.\nGlobal Series 1955–1957"

Initially just playing in regional tournaments and the occasional one-off match, they began participating in the brand new Big Eight tournament in 1976. Then in 1982 the Big Eight offered volleyball as a full sport including in-season conference play. The Cyclones struggled to put together competitive squads for most of their early years. Until 1995 they were unable to finish in the top half of the Big Eight. Jackie Nunez's 1995 team was the first in school history to make the NCAA Tournament to go along with their second-place finish in the conference.\nThe 1997 transition to the Big 12 did not treat the Cyclones well. During their first nine seasons as a member of the Big 12, they were only able to win 13 out of 59 matches in conference play.\nChristy Johnson-Lynch (2005–present).\nThe hiring of Christy Johnson-Lynch in 2005 brought new life to the Cyclones as she has taken them to new heights. She took the Cyclones to the second round of the NCAA tournament in 2006 and returned every year until 2018. This includes three Sweet 16 teams and two runs to Elite 8. She has produced 22 AVCA All-Americans."

        "text": "Spencer Martin (born June 8, 1995) is a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender for the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL). Martin was selected by the Colorado Avalanche in the third round, 63rd overall, in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nAn Ontario native, Martin played midget hockey with the Toronto Jr. Canadiens before he was originally selected 18th overall in the 2011 OHL Priority Selection by the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors, He made his debut in the 2011–12 season, appearing in 15 games in the last season that the team was known as the Majors.\nWith the renamed Mississauga Steelheads during the 2012–13 season, Martin was an invited participant at the 2013 CHL Top Prospects Game where he led Team Orr to a rare shutout win. Leading up to the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, Martin was rated as a top prospect. He was the fifth goalie selected in the draft, when he was selected 63rd overall by the Colorado Avalanche.\nIn the 2013–14 season, Martin, playing in his second campaign as the Steelheads' first-choice goaltender, appeared in a league-high 64 games and 3562 minutes in posting 24 wins. In his final year of major junior hockey, Martin was signed by the Avalanche to a three-year, entry-level contract on October 5, 2014.\nWhile playing in a career-high 50 games during the 2016–17 season, Martin was selected for the 2017 AHL All-Star Classic, the first and only Rampage goaltender to ever be selected. The same season, Martin made his NHL debut on January 21, 2017, in a 3–2 overtime loss to the San Jose Sharks. Due to the recalls by the Avalanche, Martin was unable to participate in the All-Star Classic. On July 16, 2018, Martin signed a one-year contract extension with the Avalanche.\nAn impending restricted free agent following the conclusion of his entry-level contract, Martin's tenure with the Avalanche ended after he was not tendered a qualifying offer on June 25, 2019. On the opening day of free agency, Martin agreed to a one-year, two-way contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning on July 1, 2019.\nMartin was one of eight players called up to the Lightning for their training camp prior to the 2020 Stanley Cup Playoffs.\nOn May 3, 2021, Martin signed a one-year, two-way contract extension with the Lightning.\nIn the following off-season, on July 31, 2021, Martin was traded by the Lightning to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for future considerations. Martin played 7 games for the AHL's Abbotsford Canucks to begin the 2021–22 campaign, posting a 5–0–2 record with a 2.24 GAA, .921 save percentage and 1 shutout, a 23-save performance against the San Diego Gulls, before being called up to the parent club on January 15 after its backup netminder, Jaroslav Halák, was placed on COVID-19 protocol. Starter Thatcher Demko subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 on January 20. This led to Martin playing in his first NHL game in nearly five years on January 21. Facing the league leading Florida Panthers, Martin turned aside 33 shots in a 2–1 shootout loss and was named the game's first star. He followed this up with a 47-save effort in a 3–2 overtime loss to the Edmonton Oilers on January 25. Martin earned his first NHL win in his following start, stopping 33 shots in a 5–1 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on January 27. He was reassigned to Abbotsford on January 30 as Demko and Halák returned to play.\nOn September 29, 2023, the Columbus Blue Jackets claimed Martin off waivers from the Vancouver Canucks. Remaining with Columbus to begin the 2023–24 season, Martin made his debut with the Blue Jackets replacing starting goaltender Elvis Merzļikins during a 5–3 victory over the New York Rangers on October 14, 2023. Martin was used in rotation by the Blue Jackets, posting just three wins through 13 games, before he was surpassed for the backup role by Daniil Tarasov. Martin was placed on waivers by the Blue Jackets, and was subsequently claimed by the Carolina Hurricanes on January 19, 2024.\nInternational play.\nMartin won a bronze medal with Team Ontario at the 2012 World U-17 Hockey Challenge, and was also a member of Canada national under-18 team at the 2012 IIHF World U18 Championships, which won bronze medals. In 2013, he helped Canada's under-18 team win gold medals at the 2013 IIHF World U18 Championships."

The winner of the tournament earned the Sun Belt Conference's automatic bid to the 2017 NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\nSeeding.\nIn a change from previous years, the seeding for the tournament was modified with the re-introduction of division play. The #1 seed would be the division winner with the best record, and the other division winner would be the #2 seed. This would reward each division winner for winning their division. Once the #1 seed is determined, the other division winner is automatically granted the #2 seed, even if that team's overall conference record isn't the second best. Seeds 3–10 are then assigned regardless of division based on conference winning percentage, with the bottom four seeds competing in a play-in round. The remaining eight teams will then play a two bracket, double-elimination tournament. The winner of each bracket will play a championship final.\nSchedule.\nDue to poor field conditions and the threat of further inclement weather the first round of the tournament was postponed. Alternative sites and make-up schedules are being examined. On May 24 the Sun Belt announced that the tournament would move to a single elimination format.\nBracket.\nPlay-in round.\nThe first two matchups of the tournament were single-elimination and were held on Thursday May 25, 2017.\nSingle-elimination round.\nCoastal Carolina faced the team that won on the day before with the lowest seed with the other winner against Texas-Arlington. The tournament was originally scheduled to be a double elimination tournament. Due to weather and poor field conditions they had to make the tournament single elimination."

The Tigresses swept their elimination games in 1988, 1993 and 1996 and were declared automatic champions in each of those years. They also have the third most Final Four appearances with 13, behind La Salle’s 18 and the FEU Lady Tamaraws’ 14. UST made seven straight Final Four appearances from 2005 until 2012.\nThe Tigresses also have six Premier Volleyball League championships, with the distinction of being the inaugural winners in 2004 when the tournament was still known as the Shakey’s V-League. They hold the same number of six championships in the UNIGAMES, with back-to-back wins in 2009 and 2010, and then capped by a three-peat from 2016 until 2018.\nHistory.\nThe Golden Tigresses’ team colors were derived from UST’s school colors of gold, black, and white, which were in turn inspired by the flag of the Papal States since their pontifical status was obtained in 1902.\nThe Tigresses who used to be called the Lady Goldies won their first championship in 1974. Even as the men’s volleyball team existed during their time in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the 1920s, the women’s team was only formed in the same year of the sports’ inception in the UAAP in 1938. The 1974 title was the first of three consecutive championships won until 1976. They next achieved an unprecedented seven-year title run from 1984 until 1990 under then coach August Sta. Maria.\nRivalries.\nThe UST Golden Tigresses and the FEU Lady Tamaraws met in the finals for a total of 13 seasons, with UST winning 11 times.\nThe rivalry between the De La Salle Lady Spikers and the Tigresses has also been apparent in women's volleyball with the two teams being frequent finalists in the UAAP Volleyball Championships, the UNIGAMES and the Shakey's V-League. The two teams met four times in the UAAP finals, with La Salle winning three. They also faced each other thrice in the finals of the Shakey's V-League, with UST winning the first and the Lady Spikers winning the latter two. The Tigresses have also defeated La Salle thrice in the UNIGAMES finals.\nCurrent season.\nRoster.\nAs of 18 Feb 2024"

The following criteria were applied (Regulations Articles 13.03 and 15.02):\nIn the play-offs, the team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs qualified for the final tournament. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e., the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals were also equal, extra time was played. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e., if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out (Regulations Article 17.01).\nSchedule.\nThe qualifying matches were played on dates that fell within the FIFA Women's International Match Calendar.\nEntrants.\nThe teams were ranked according to their coefficient ranking, calculated based on the following:\nThe 30 highest-ranked teams entered the qualifying group stage, while the 16 lowest-ranked teams entered the preliminary round. The coefficient ranking was also used for seeding in the preliminary round and qualifying group stage draws.\nPreliminary round.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the preliminary round was held on 19 January 2017, 13:30 CET (), at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\nThe 16 teams were allocated into four seeding positions according to their coefficient ranking. They were drawn into four groups of four containing one team from each of the four seeding positions. First, the four teams which were pre-selected as hosts were drawn from their own designated pot and allocated to their respective group as per their seeding positions. Next, the remaining 12 teams were drawn from their respective pot which were allocated according to their seeding positions.\nRanking of second-placed teams.\nTo determine the best second-placed teams from the preliminary round which advance to the qualifying group stage, only the results of the second-placed teams against the first and third-placed teams in their group were taken into account, while results against the fourth-placed team were not included. As a result, two matches played by each second-placed team were counted for the purposes of determining the ranking.\nQualifying group stage.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the qualifying group stage was held on 25 April 2017, 13:30 CEST (), at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\nThe 35 teams were allocated into five seeding pots according to their coefficient ranking, with the five preliminary round qualifiers placed in Pot E. They were drawn into seven groups of five containing one team from each of the five seeding pots. For political reasons, Russia and Ukraine would not be drawn in the same group.\nRanking of second-placed teams.\nTo determine the four best second-placed teams from the qualifying group stage which advanced to the play-offs, only the results of the second-placed teams against the first, third and fourth-placed teams in their group were taken into account, while results against the fifth-placed team were not included.

        "text": "The 1947–48 NCAA men's ice hockey season began in November 1947 and concluded with the 1948 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament's championship game on March 20, 1948 at the Broadmoor Ice Palace in Colorado Springs, Colorado. This was the 1st season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held and is the 54th year overall where an NCAA school fielded a team. In 1947 there were quasi-official guidelines separating major and minor football programs across the NCAA, but no such determinations had been made for ice hockey teams. Even among the universities that played ice hockey, no such distinctions were even attempted until the mid-1960s. As such, all American universities operating a men's varsity ice hockey program are included here.\nAs this was the first time a national championship was held, it is considered (unofficially) the first season of NCAA Division I ice hockey since it is the first time that any college teams would have to conform to NCAA regulations regarding recruitment, scholarship, eligibility, etc. The tournament was, itself, born out of a desire to definitively decide the best collegiate team in the country. With only a handful of universities even playing ice hockey (indoor ice rinks were fairly expensive to operate) and even less playing a decent number of games each year only four teams were selected to play in the tournament.\nPlayer stats.\nScoring leaders.\nThe following players led the league in points at the conclusion of the season.\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nLeading goaltenders.\nThe following goaltenders led the league in goals against average at the end of the regular season while playing at least 33% of their team's total minutes.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; OT = Overtime/shootout losses; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\""

        "text": "Chris Johnson (born 1986) is an English rugby union footballer, currently playing at Fly-half or Centre for Sale in National League 1. An outstanding player who can kick points, drop goals, and score tries, he is one of the most prolific scorers of all time in both National League 2 North and National League 1, with over 3,000 points spread across the two divisions from his time with Huddersfield, Fylde and Sale. Johnson has also had a very successful representative career, winning the Bill Beaumont Cup five times with Lancashire, and captaining the England Counties XV.\nCareer.\nHuddersfield.\nGrowing up in Lancashire where he played junior rugby at Rochdale, upon finishing school Johnson moved across the Pennines to study at the University of Huddersfield. While at university Johnson came to the attention of local rugby union side, Huddersfield, who were playing in North Division 1 (now known as National League 3 North) and signed with them for the 2006–07 season. In 2008 Huddersfield finished runners up in the league to Kendal, qualifying for a promotion playoff against Midlands Division 1 runners up Luctonians, with the Yorkshire side gaining home advantage due to a better comparable league standing. Johnson was outstanding in the playoff game at Lockwood Park, kicking 18 points in the 22–7 victory against Luctonians, and helping Huddersfield achieve a first ever promotion to the National Leagues.\nThe 2008–09 season was the first for Huddersfield in National Division 3 North and they managed to finish 10th out of the 14 teams, way clear of relegation. Johnson also adapted well to the higher level with 248 points making him the third top scorer in the division, which included 7 drop goals across the season. Outside of the league, Chris starred in a Huddersfield side that made it to the semi-finals of the Yorkshire Cup, going out 6–13 to eventual winners Leeds Carnegie. This form saw Lancashire born Johnson selected by reigning county champions Yorkshire as member of their 2009 Bill Beaumont Cup squad, although he could not help the side retain the cup. He also made his England Counties XV debut in March 2009, starting in the 19–27 defeat to France Federale XV at the match at Twickenham. The 2009–10 season saw National Division 3 North re-branded as National League 2 North as part of the RFU's changes to the English league system, which would also see the division increase by 2 teams to 16. Huddersfield ended the season in 11th while Johnson scored 327 points to one more finish as the third most prolific points scorer in the division. At the end of the season Johnson's form with his club side would once again see him called up by Yorkshire for the 2010 Bill Beaumont Cup.\nThe 2010–11 season saw Huddersfield finish 8th in the league with Johnson becoming the top scorer in the division with 387 points, including a career best 15 tries. He also played a key role in Huddersfield winning the Yorkshire Cup for the first time in the club's history, scoring 15 points in a 25–18 win over Hull in the final held at York. The final act of Johnson's season saw him switch his county allegiance from Yorkshire to the county of his birth, Lancashire, and he was part of the squad that would win the 2011 Bill Beaumont Cup. 2011–12 would be Johnson's final season at the club and he went out on a successful note as he helped Huddersfield to a highest ever position in the league as they finished in 6th place. Once again he would also finish as top scorer in the league with 362 points. He was also picked once for Lancashire for the 2012 Bill Beaumont Cup, playing in the final at Twickenham Stadium in a 38 – 20 defeat to Hertfordshire. Despite finishing runners up, Johnson had a fantastic tournament scoring 62 points, with 24 of those coming in the 54–33 victory away to former county side Yorkshire in front of 2,023 supporters at Scarborough – a record crowd for the ground.\nFylde.\nIn the summer of 2012, after six seasons with Huddersfield and over 1,800 points scored, Johnson decided to move back to Lancashire to sign for Fylde, playing one division higher in National League 1. His first season in National League 1 saw him became a regular in a Fylde side that finished the 2012–13 season in 6th place, scoring 251 points (the 4th highest tally in the division). As well as playing league games, Johnson also took part in the Fylde side that reached the semi-finals of the Lancashire Cup, losing 24–25 to rivals Preston Grasshoppers at home. Johnson was also called up to the Lancashire for the 2013 Bill Beaumont Cup where he had an excellent tournament, scoring 36 points (the second highest in the competition), 15 of which came the final in a 35–26 victory against Cornwall. He finished off the year by being selected for the England Counties XV side on their tour summer tour of Belgium. He played against Belgium 'A', leading his side out as captain and scoring 28 points (including 1 try) in a 78–0 victory. A second appearance would follow as he scored a try in a 57–5 win over Belgium to cap off a very successful season.\nThe 2013–14 season with Fylde saw his club finish an excellent 3rd in the league with Johnson once more one of the top scorers in the league with 272 points including 10 tries. Consistent good performances with Fylde saw Johnson come to the attention of Premiership side, Sale Sharks, and he was picked to play for the Jets development side, making his A-League debut in October 2013, scoring a try and drop goal in a 40–19 win against Northampton Wanderers at Heywood Road. At the start of 2014 Johnson captained England Counties XV as they lost very close games against France Federale XV and an Irish Club XV. His season finished with for Lancashire at the 2014 Bill Beaumont Cup, finishing as the competition's top scorer with 60 points as his county retained the trophy with a 36–26 victory over last year's finalists, Cornwall.\nThe 2014–15 season saw Fylde drop one place down to finish 5th in the league, with Johnson ending up as the second highest scorer in the division with 252 points (behind Richmond's Rob Kirby). Johnson would also return to action with England Counties XV at the start of 2015, scoring 7 points in a 37–3 victory against a Scottish Club XV in front of 1,200 supporters at Fylde's Woodlands Memorial Ground. He was even better in the next game for Counties as he bagged all 24 points in a 24 – 15 win against France Federale XV at Périgueux. The year would finish with Lancashire at the 2015 Bill Beaumont Cup, scoring 21 points as his side reached their fourth successive final, only to lose 18–13 against Cornwall, who avenged the two previous final defeats. The 2015–16 season was the last for Johnson at Fylde, scoring 215 points from 25 games as his side finished in 6th place. He also made further appears for England Counties in a 27 – 57 defeat against Scottish Clubs XV at Netherdale, as well as appearing for Lancashire at the 2016 Bill Beaumont Cup as his side failed to make the final for the first time in eight years.\nSale FC.\nIn the summer of 2016, after four seasons with Fylde, over 900 points scored for the club, and multiple county championship triumphs with Lancashire, Johnson decided to sign for Sale FC, playing one division below in National League 2 North. Reasons given for the move were that Johnson wanted to cut down on travel (Sale FC were closer to where he worked) and that his new club had more potential for winning silverware in the future. Although he was relegated to reserve kicker behind team-mate Luke McGovern he featured in all of Sale's games as they finished second to league champions Caldy. Unfortunately for Johnson his team were unable to grab promotion at the second chance of asking as they lost their promotion playoff game at home to National League 2 South runners up Old Elthamians. The disappointment of missing out on promotion was tempered as Johnson was called up to the Lancashire who went on to win the 2017 Bill Beaumont Cup. He started the final and kicked two conversions as his side beat Cornwall 19–8 at Twickenham Stadium for the counties 24th title and the first since 2014.\nHis second season (2017–18) at Sale FC was an excellent one. With Luke McGovern leaving the club, Johnson once again became the main kicker. He was ever present in the Sale FC that went on to become champions of National League 2 North, contributing 324 (second highest in league) as his club finished five points clear of runners up Sedgley Park to gain promotion to National League 1. Promotion was followed by more silverware as Johnson scored 55 points for Lancashire during the 2018 Bill Beaumont Cup, including 22 points in the 33-16 win over Hertfordshire in the final.\nSecond spell at Huddersfield.\nAlthough Johnson started the 2018–19 season with Sale FC in National League 1, in November 2018 he decided to drop down a league and return to play for former club, Huddersfield in National League 2 North, after an absence of six years. The reasons for him leaving were due to family commitments and the greater amount of travel required in National League 1. Despite not playing a full-season, he still managed to finish in the top 5 scorers in the league, scoring 222 points, and helping Huddersfield to a best-ever 4th place finish.\nSecond spell at Sale FC.\nIn June 2019, Johnson resigned with Sale FC, once more playing in National League 1 for the 2019-20 season.\nHonours and records.\nClub.\nHuddersfield\nSale FC\nYorkshire\nLancashire"

        "title": "Noah Brown (American football)",
        "text": "Noah Brown (born January 6, 1996) is an American football wide receiver for the Houston Texans of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Ohio State and was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round of the 2017 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nA resident of the Flanders section of Mount Olive Township, New Jersey, Brown attended Pope John XXIII Regional High School in Sparta, New Jersey. He missed his sophomore season after breaking his ribs in the first game. As a junior, he had 41 receptions for 630 yards and six touchdowns.\nAs a senior, he recorded 41 receptions for 857 yards, 14 receiving touchdowns and 7 rushing touchdowns, helping his team reach the Non-Public Group III final and receiving All-New Jersey honors by the \"Newark Star-Ledger\". He committed to Ohio State University to play college football. He finished with over 3,000 all-purpose yards and 42 touchdowns, after playing at wide receiver, running back and kick returner.\nBrown was a highly sought after prospect that received many offers from Virginia Tech, Notre Dame, Penn State, Michigan State, Pittsburgh, and USC. He had multiple visits to Columbus in 2013 and opted to shut down his recruiting early and commit to Ohio State five months before National Signing Day.\nCollege career.\nAs a true freshman in 2014, he played in all 14 games in a backup role, including the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship victory over Oregon. He had one reception for nine yards and one run for a 4-yard loss, while playing wide receiver, H-back and special teams.\nThe next year, he excelled in spring practice and was expected to earn the starting wide receiver job, until suffering a broken left tibia and fibula late in fall camp during a non-contact drill, forcing him to redshirt for the 2015 season. The injury was serious enough to require two separate surgeries.\nAs a sophomore in 2016, Brown returned and started in all 13 games. He had 32 receptions (second on the team) for 402 yards and 7 touchdowns (tied for the team lead). In the third game against the University of Oklahoma, he tied a school record with 4 receiving touchdowns, while totaling 5 receptions for 72 yards. After the season, he decided to forgo his remaining two years of eligibility and enter the 2017 NFL Draft.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nOn January 7, 2017, Brown announced via Twitter that he decided to forgo his senior season and enter the NFL draft. Many analysts were surprised he decided to enter the draft and opt out of his last two years of remaining eligibility, due to his limited experience as a one-year starter and his low draft projection. He was one of 58 collegiate wide receivers to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. Brown chose to only perform the three-cone drill, short shuttle, and bench press. He tied for second in the bench press behind Shepherd's Billy Brown who had 23 reps, but ended up playing tight end in the NFL.\nOn March 23, Brown attended Ohio State's pro day along with Marshon Lattimore, Gareon Conley, Raekwon McMillan, Curtis Samuel, and five other prospects. He performed the 40-yard dash, 20-yard dash, and 10-yard dash as scouts and team representatives from all 32 NFL teams looked on, including head coaches Bill Belichick (New England Patriots), Mike Tomlin (Pittsburgh Steelers), Hue Jackson (Cleveland Browns), Mike Mularkey (Tennessee Titans), Sean Payton (New Orleans Saints), Jim Caldwell (Detroit Lions), and Marvin Lewis (Cincinnati Bengals). At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Brown was projected to be a fifth or sixth round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the 27th best wide receiver prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com.\nDallas Cowboys.\n2017 season.\nBrown was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round (239th overall) of the 2017 NFL draft. He was the 31st wide receiver drafted in 2017, and the second wide receiver selected by the Cowboys after North Carolina's Ryan Switzer. Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones stated that running back Ezekiel Elliott was one of the main reasons they drafted Brown, after Elliott continually advocated for his former Ohio State teammate. On May 11, 2017, the Cowboys signed Brown to a four-year, $2.47 million contract that included a signing bonus of $71,938.\nThroughout training camp, Brown competed for a roster spot as the fifth or sixth wide receiver on the Cowboys' depth chart against Brice Butler, Lucky Whitehead, Andy Jones, and Lance Lenoir. Head coach Jason Garrett named Brown the sixth wide receiver on the Cowboys' depth chart, behind Dez Bryant, Terrance Williams, Cole Beasley, Butler, and Switzer.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Cowboys' Week 2 loss of 42–17 at the Denver Broncos. The following week, he made his first career reception during the Cowboys' 28–17 victory at the Arizona Cardinals. His reception came off a pass by quarterback Dak Prescott and he gained 13 yards before being tackled by Tyrann Mathieu. On November 19, Brown caught a pass for a season-long 14 yards during a 37–9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.\nHis contributions came from blocking downfield for the running game and on special teams, where he used his 6–2, 225-pound frame to his advantage. In Week 16, his blocking ability secured his first career start in the Cowboys' 21–12 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, as the offense opened with 3 receivers. He finished his rookie season with four receptions for 33 receiving yards in 13 games with one start. He was declared inactive in 3 contests.\n2018 season.\nBrown missed most of training camp and preseason with a hamstring injury. On September 3, 2018, he was placed on injured reserve. On November 9, he was activated off injured reserve. He started in the last 2 games of the season. \nHe was mostly used for his blocking abilities, appearing in 8 games with 2 starts, while registering 5 receptions for 54 yards and 5 special teams tackles (seventh on the team).\n2019 season.\nBrown began training camp on the physically unable to perform list, because of an offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. On August 31, he was left on the PUP list, where he spent the rest of the season. In November, he had a second surgery performed to alleviate his lingering knee issue.\n2020 season.\nBrown slimmed down to be more involved in the passing game, but the team's depth at wide receiver kept him mostly in a blocking and special teams role. In Week 4 against the Browns, he had 4 receptions for 43 yards. \nIn Week 12 against the Washington Football Team, he made 3 receptions for 40 yards. He appeared in all 16 games with one start, posting 14 receptions for 154 yards and 2 special teams tackles.\n2021 season.\nOn March 17, 2021, Brown re-signed with the Cowboys. He was declared inactive for the season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, after being activated from the Reserve/COVID-19 list the previous day. He had 2 receptions for 47 yards against the Patriots. Although he started against the Kansas City Chiefs, substituting Amari Cooper who was placed on the Reserve/COVID-19 list, he wasn't able to record any offensive stats and dropped 2 passes. \nHe had 6 receptions for 53 yards against the Las Vegas Raiders on Thanksgiving Day. On December 9, he was placed on injured reserve with a groin injury. He was activated on January 1, 2022. He appeared in 13 games with one start, making 16 receptions for 184 yards and 3 special teams tackles.\n2022 season.\nOn March 8, 2022, Brown re-signed with the Cowboys. He came into training camp leaner and quicker, to take advantage of the additional snaps available at the wide receiver position; Cooper was traded, Cedrick Wilson Jr. left in free agency and Michael Gallup was still in the process of recovering from an offseason ACL surgery. \nHe made 5 receptions for 68 yards in the season opener against the Buccaneers. In the second game against the Bengals, he collected 5 receptions for 91 yards, his first career touchdown and made a 12-yard reception on the final drive that helped set up the game-winning 50-yard field goal. He didn't play against the Chicago Bears because of a foot injury. He had 4 receptions for 85 yards against the Houston Texans. \nBrown's production as a receiver slowed as the season went on, contributing to the Cowboys' decision to sign veteran T.Y. Hilton on December 12. The former caught 6 receptions for 49 yards and 2 touchdowns against the Jacksonville Jaguars, but he also dropped a potential first-down reception; this gave the Jaguars the chance to mount a final drive and set up the winning field goal. In the last 3 contests of the season, he posted 3 receptions for 22 yards.\nHe appeared in 16 games, registering career-highs in starts (13), receptions (43), receiving yards (555), yards per reception (12.9) and touchdowns (3). He also tied for fifth on the team with 4 special teams tackles.\nHouston Texans.\nOn March 17, 2023, Brown signed a one-year contract with the Texans. He was placed on injured reserve on September 13, and was activated on October 14. In a Week 10 game against the Bengals, Brown had his best career game, catching 7 passes for 172 yards as the Texans won 30–27. \nNoah would play for five more games, accumulating 12 catches for 128 yards and a TD to end the season. Receiving a playoff target, Brown was unable to add to his postseason stats, playing only five snaps. On January 15, 2024, Brown was put on IR after suffering a shoulder injury on the second drive of the game.\nOn March 15, 2024, Brown re-signed with the Texans.\nNFL career statistics.\nRegular season.\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|2017 !!

        "text": "The 2019 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 90th Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The game was hosted by the Cleveland Indians and was played at Progressive Field on July 9, 2019, with the American League prevailing over the National League, 4–3. \nThe decision to name Cleveland the host city was announced on January 27, 2017, by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred. It was the sixth All-Star Game in Cleveland, and the first since 1997; this established the Indians as the team to have hosted the most All-Star Games, breaking a four-way tie with the Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals, and Cincinnati Reds, who have each hosted the game five times. It was also the first time since 2014 that an American League team has hosted the event. That All-Star Game also coincided with the 25th anniversary of Progressive Field and made it the second All-Star Game hosted by that ballpark.\nAlex Cora of the defending World Series champion Boston Red Sox managed the American League, and Dave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers managed the National League for the second consecutive year. The Houston Astros once again led all of baseball with a record six players selected to the All-Star roster, including four starters.\nHost selection.\nBidding for the 2019 All-Star Game began roughly five years before in 2014, according to Indians owner Paul Dolan. The selection of Cleveland to host the 2019 All-Star Game was heavily influenced by three major factors. The first involves recent improvement and growth throughout downtown Cleveland. The second factor is the recent success enjoyed by the Indians which culminated in an appearance in the 2016 World Series. Commissioner Manfred spoke highly of the city and its response to the World Series, stating that, \"Cleveland's a baseball town and it will be a great host for the Midsummer Classic.\" Recent renovations and improvements in Progressive Field were the third factor influencing the decision to name the ballpark as the All-Star Game host for the second time.\nThis marked the sixth time the Indians have hosted the All-Star Game, more than any other team. Likewise, this is the sixth All-Star Game played in Cleveland, the third most All-Star Games hosted by any city, only trailing New York (nine games hosted by four teams) and Chicago (seven games hosted by two teams).\nFan balloting.\nVoting for the All-Star game was changed from previous years. \"Primary\" voting lasted from on May 28 to June 21. The \"primary\" determined the top three vote-getters at every infield position and top nine vote-getters in the outfield for both the American and National Leagues. From this group of finalists, fans determined the All-Star Game starters. Voting ran from June 26 to 27.\nUnlike the format from previous years, which allowed fans to vote on a standard ballot up to 35 times, they could vote up to five times per day during the \"primary\" but only once during the final voting which determined the starting lineups. The \"Starters Election\" winners are highlighted below.\nThe remainder of the rosters, including all pitchers, were selected by player vote and input from both managers.\nFull rosters were announced on June 30.\nRosters.\nNational League.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLogo.\nThe Indians and Major League Baseball unveiled the electric guitar inspired logo for the 2019 All-Star Game on August 7, 2018.\nNational Anthems.\nThe Canadian national anthem was sung by country singer Lindsay Ell. The American national anthem was sung by pop singer MAX."

It was planned to be hosted on July 14 by the Los Angeles Dodgers, which would have been the second All-Star Game held at Dodger Stadium, following the 1980 All-Star Game, and the fourth hosted by the Dodgers. On July 3, the game was canceled due to the delayed start of the 2020 season, which began on July 23 due to the government restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first cancellation since 1945, when the All-Star Game that year was not held in compliance with wartime travel restrictions at the time. Dodger Stadium was awarded the 2022 All-Star Game in its place. Fox and ESPN Radio were the game's respective planned television and radio partners.\nHost selection.\nBidding for the 2020 All-Star Game began in 2017.

        "title": "2017 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2017 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2017 National Rugby League season and was played on Sunday October 1 at Sydney's ANZ Stadium. The match was contested between minor premiers the Melbourne Storm and the eighth-placed North Queensland Cowboys. The Melbourne club won the match 34 – 6 to claim their third premiership title. Melbourne fullback Billy Slater was awarded his second Clive Churchill Medal as the game's official man of the match.\nThe match was preceded by the 2017 NRL Under-20s Grand Final and the 2017 NRL State Championship. Pre-match entertainment was headlined by American rapper Macklemore, who attracted controversy for his scheduled performance of \"Same Love\" during the ongoing nationwide postal survey on same-sex marriage. The match was broadcast live throughout Australia by the Nine Network.\nFairfax Media described the 2017 NRL Grand final as \"one of the most one-sided grand finals in the NRL era\".\nBackground.\nThis was the third time that a grand final was contested by two non-Sydney/New South Wales based teams, after the 2006 Grand Final (Brisbane defeating Melbourne) and the 2015 Grand Final (North Queensland defeating Brisbane), and the first to feature neither the Brisbane Broncos or a Sydney-based club. The Melbourne Storm qualified for their seventh grand final since 2006, with only coach Craig Bellamy and halfback Cooper Cronk having been involved on each occasion. It was also the first time since 2009 that a side had reached a premiership decider in consecutive seasons, with the Storm having made four straight appearances between 2006-2009. The North Queensland Cowboys made their first grand final appearance since their maiden premiership victory over the Brisbane Broncos in 2015, as well as their third in the club's history. It was the first time since the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in 2014 that a side reached a grand final from outside the top-four, the first time since the Parramatta Eels in 2009 to reach the grand final from as low as 8th position, and the first club to qualify from 8th under the current final eight system that was implemented in 2012.\nClaiming their third minor premiership, the Melbourne Storm finished the regular season on 44 competition points, six points clear of the second placed Sydney Roosters in losing only 4 games from 24 matches. Their points differential of +297 was their highest amount since 2008. With a two-game home ground advantage, they defeated the fourth-placed Parramatta Eels 18–16 to earn a week off and a place in the grand final qualifier, where they would beat the Brisbane Broncos 30–0 to reach a consecutive grand final. North Queensland only made the finals series after the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs defeated the St. George Illawarra Dragons in the final round of the regular season. This result denied St. George Illawarra 8th spot and allowed the North Queensland side into the finals instead. North Queensland made a winning run defeating their next three opponents in the finals, all of whom were Sydney-based clubs. They defeated defending premiers, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks 15–14 in extra time at Allianz Stadium, Parramatta 24–16 at ANZ Stadium, and the Roosters 29–16 at Allianz Stadium, making it the first time they have reached a grand final without losing a finals match.\nMelbourne and North Queensland have previously played each other in a finals series on three occasions. Their first meeting was in 2005 at, the then named, Aussie Stadium where North Queensland defeated Melbourne 24-16 in the Semi Final. Their second was in 2015, when North Queensland defeated Melbourne 32–12 at Melbourne's AAMI Park to qualify for the Grand Final. Their third meeting was in the 2016 Qualifying Final, when Melbourne defeated North Queensland 16-10 at AAMI Park; Melbourne would earn a week off and finish runners-up that season.\nTeams.\nMelbourne Storm halfback Cooper Cronk played in his seventh grand final after having previously featured in every premiership decider his club have reached since 2006. It would also be his last game for the Melbourne side after playing 323 first-grade games for the club. Cronk, Will Chambers, Cameron Smith, Jesse Bromwich, and Billy Slater were the last remaining members of their last premiership winning team in 2012. The North Queensland Cowboys had twelve players from their 2015 Premiership winning side. Co-captains Johnathan Thurston and Matt Scott are the most notable absentees from their last Grand Final appearance after both suffered long-term injuries during the season, although Scott was named as a reserve for the starting line-up. They were replaced by Te Maire Martin and Scott Bolton (who was promoted to the starting line-up after coming off the bench in 2015) respectively, with Martin being transferred mid-season from the Penrith Panthers to cover the injured representative halfback. North Queensland utility Ben Hampton made a consecutive Grand Final appearance after playing for the Storm in their loss to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks the preceding year's premiership decider.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard/&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard/&gt;\nFirst half.\nIt was a tough night for the North Queensland side from the outset when Shaun Fensom was taken out of the game after a freak accident. Fensom tried to prevent a break from Melbourne but was tangled up with teammate Ethan Lowe. His leg was forced sideways and his grand final was over after just three minutes with a suspected broken tibia.\nAfter a lengthy stoppage of almost 10 minutes, the Melbourne side looked likely to score first despite some bruising defence from Antonio Winterstein.\nThe first try came in the 19th minute when Will Chambers pounced on a loose ball 10m from his own line and beat a couple of defenders before offloading to Josh Addo-Carr, who sprinted 75m for the try. Cameron Smith converted and Melbourne lead 6-0.\nFrom that point on the Melbourne side went about their business with clinical precision. As usual, it was the kicking game of Cooper Cronk which was on fire, ably supported by his captain Cameron Smith. Cronk forced a dropout with a well-weighted kick and on the resulting play in the 28th minute, Slater drew two defenders and set up Felise Kaufusi who had a clear run to the line and gave Melbourne their second try. Smith converted and Melbourne lead 12-0.\nIt went from bad to worse for North Queensland moments later when Winterstein made an error off a seemingly innocuous Cronk grubber. In a complete team performance, the “Big Three” had their fingerprints all over the execution of the plan and in the 37th minute, Cronk and Smith combined for Slater to slice through past Justin O’Neil for Melbourne's third try. Smith converted and Melbourne lead 18-0. Just before the half time siren, Feldt had set off on a long run after fielding a Cooper Cronk kick. The Melbourne chase reflected the determination of the Melbourne players.\nSecond half.\nAfter just one penalty in the opening half, the Melbourne side conceded three in a row early in the second. It gave North Queensland a rare chance at the Melbourne try line and in the 47th minute, Te Maire Martin finally broke through Melbourne's defence to score. It was the first points the Melbourne side had conceded in 140 minutes of finals football. Ethan Lowe converted and the Melbourne side lead 18-6. North Queensland began to build pressure but couldn’t make the most of further sets inside Melbourne's 20.\nMelbourne lock Dale Finucane all but put the game to bed in the 64th minute with a barge over try on the back of an assist from Smith. Smith converted and Melbourne lead 24-6.\nThe night was summed up from North Queensland in the 67th minute when Kane Linnett dropped the ball coming out of the defence. Curtis Scott scored a grand final try in his debut season after receiving a pass from Josh Addo-Carr. Smith missed the conversion and Melbourne lead 28-6.\nWith the game well and truly over, Melbourne turned into the Harlem Globetrotters with Smith, Cronk, Slater and Tohu Harris combining in the 73rd minute for a party-trick to set up Addo-Carr for his second try of the night. Smith converted and Melbourne lead 34-6. It was the icing on the cake for the best team of the season.\nOpening games.\nHolden Cup NYC Grand Final.\nThis was the last ever match of the National Youth Competition, which was scrapped after 10 seasons in favour of a return to state-based Under 20s.\nNRL State Championship.\nThe 2017 State Championship match featured the NSW Cup Premiers Penrith facing Queensland Cup premiers the Papua New Guinea Hunters.\nAftermath.\nBy winning the Grand Final, the Melbourne Storm qualified for the 2018 World Club Challenge against the Super League XXII champions Leeds Rhinos. The match would be staged in Australia for only the fourth time, where the Storm defeated the Rhinos 38–4.\nPre-match entertainment.\nAmerican rapper Macklemore was booked to perform four songs, accompanied by singers Eric Nally and Mary Lambert, including \"Same Love\". The song topped the Australian charts in 2013, and was regarded as an anthem for same-sex marriage advocates during the campaign in Macklemore's home state of Washington. In the days leading up to the grand final, the single returned to the top of the Australian iTunes charts.\nSeveral prominent conservative politicians voiced strong opposition to the scheduled performance of \"Same Love\", given its high-profile support for the 'Yes' campaign during the voting period of the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott tweeted his disapproval of a \"politicised grand final,\" while North Queensland crossbencher Bob Katter described allowing Macklemore's grand final performance as \"tantamount to seeping sewage into the debutante ball.\" Macklemore acknowledged the controversy several days before the final, but vowed to \"go harder\" as a result."

        "title": "Scottish District rugby structure",
        "text": "Scotland's District rugby union sides are provincial representative teams, that in the amateur era capped the best amateur players from their area's club sides to play inter-district matches and matches against touring sides. These districts still survive at amateur level playing in an amateur Inter-District Championship and age-grade. The professional teams Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby remain provincial sides based on the traditional districts.\nPlayers who played for their district were capped.\nBeginnings.\nThe District system began in Scotland in 1872 with the world's first provincial match, the 'Inter-City'.\nThis was a 20-a-side match between representatives of the Glasgow and Edinburgh rugby clubs on 23 November 1872.\nGlasgow District and Edinburgh District played at Burnbank Park in the west end of Glasgow. Edinburgh won the match 1 drop goal to nil.\nThe 'Inter-City' became the premier Inter-District match. Initially played twice a year for the first 4 seasons, it became an annual match thereafter. Only stopping due to world war or occasional severely inclement weather the Inter-City was absorbed into the Scottish Inter-District Championship in season 1953–-54.\nThe present Glasgow Warriors versus Edinburgh Rugby matches are a continuation of that first Inter-City match in 1872. They now play for the 1872 Cup each season.\nRugby Unions.\nThe Scottish Rugby Union was set up in 1873 as the Scottish Football Union. Scottish rugby clubs could apply for membership. District 'football' unions were also set up to develop the game at a more local level. Newly founded clubs usually applied to their District 'football' union for membership first, to become established, before being accepted into the national Scottish Football Union.\nA North of Scotland District side first played in 1881 by the SRU. The North of Scotland Rugby Union, initially formed as Scottish Northern Counties Football Union, was set up in 1887.\nA Midlands District side played the North of Scotland District on 17 December 1881. The Midlands District Rugby Union, initially formed as Scottish Midland Counties Football Union, was set up in 1889.\nA South of Scotland District side played the North of Scotland District on 31 December 1881. By 1890, the South is noted as playing Edinburgh District in December of that year.\nThe Anglo-Scots were playing South by December 1898.\nIn 1924, the Scottish Football Union became the Scottish Rugby Union. The SRU also standardised the 5 native districts by formally changing their set-ups to Glasgow District, North of Scotland, Midlands, South of Scotland and Edinburgh District Rugby Unions.\nCombined sides.\nWest v East.\nAlthough West of Scotland District and East of Scotland District occasionally played other districts, the biggest district trial match usually was the West of Scotland District versus the East of Scotland District.\nPlayers from the various districts were split along geographical lines for the West – East match, which was used as a selection trial match for the Scotland national rugby union team. It began in the spring of 1876 and its purpose was to broaden the opportunities for selection for all players throughout Scotland, not just the Glasgow District and Edinburgh District players who already were showcased in the Inter-City match. Thus, after the West - East fixture was introduced, the Inter-City match became an annual event from 1876–77 season onwards.\nHowever, the Scottish Rugby Union later standardised the trial matches outwith geographical districts from 1934–35 season onwards. There was usually a Blues Trial versus Whites Trial match where the possible candidates for international selection were represented; then a second final trial match where a typical Scotland Probables line-up would play the Scotland Possibles in a 'probables versus possibles' or 'Scotland versus Rest of Scotland' match. The mid 1980s saw the introduction of a Reds Trial side.\nGradually the West versus East trial match lost importance. By the onset of the Second World War it was used as a proving match for young talent. The West – East match continued up to the 1973–74 season as a junior match; but after that, the Districts took control of their own junior sides by fielding Under 23 sides.\nThe fixture has recently been resurrected for the Under 16 and Under 18 age grades.\nCities v Provinces.\nVery occasionally the Glasgow District and Edinburgh District sides would combine as a Cities District side. They would then play the 'Rest of Scotland' or a combined North-South team, usually known as the Provinces District side.\nThis practice although rare was usually kept for international touring sides. The combined Cities side was then just known as Glasgow - Edinburgh.\nScottish Districts.\nThe largest combined side was the Combined Scottish Districts side. This essentially took the best players from the districts, usually to play international touring sides.\nAlthough primarily used as a showcase match for Scotland hopefuls, the Scottish Districts side was open to all nationalities currently playing in Scotland (like the District sides themselves).\nSmaller districts.\nVarious smaller representative district sides were also set up. They usually played one another and their best players were then considered for the larger district rugby unions.\nThe smaller districts include:-\nand other combined or county sides were also variously used as representative sides:-\nOther representative sides.\nThe most well known of the other Scottish representative sides is the Co-Optimist Rugby Club.\nScottish Inter-District Championship.\nThe set-up of the Scottish Inter-District Championship in 1953 saw Scottish rugby coalesce around 4 main district rugby unions. Glasgow District, Edinburgh District, South and North were initially picked, with the Midlands District players entered into the North side.\nMidlands District complained to the SRU and a combined team, North and Midlands, was entered in subsequent seasons.\nThese 4 teams became the standard District sides.\nOther District matches were still played out with the Championship. Midlands still played North; and Glasgow still played Rest of the West. Gradually, however, the season's District matches settled on the 4 standard sides, although the Anglo-Scots were an increasing addition to the non-championship Inter-District matches and touring International teams were invariably entertained.\nThe Anglo-Scots entered the championship in 1981.\nProfessionalism.\nWhen the Scottish Rugby Union adopted professionalism in 1996, it decided to professionalise the 4 standard district teams. Glasgow District became the Glasgow Warriors; Edinburgh District became Edinburgh Rugby; North and Midlands became Caledonia Reds; and South became the Border Reivers. The Scottish Exiles were not included in this revamp as the Scottish Inter-District Championship became a European Qualifying Tournament for the Heineken Cup.\nPresently, with only Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby remaining, Glasgow has nominally taken over the Caledonia Reds district and Edinburgh has taken over the Border Reivers district.\nThe 4 standard districts still survive at age grade level and the SRU still has a long-term goal of having 4 professional district sides once again in Scotland."

        "title": "List of five-wicket hauls in women's One Day International cricket",
        "text": "A women's One Day International (WODI) is an international cricket match between two teams, each having WODI status, as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC). In a WODI match, the two teams play a single innings, each of which is restricted to a maximum of 50 overs. The first WODI matches were played as part of the 1973 Women's Cricket World Cup held in England, two years after the first men's One Day International was contested between Australia and England in January 1971. A five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. The first two five-wicket hauls in WODIs were taken on 23 June 1973, as part of the Women's World Cup. Australia's Tina Macpherson and New Zealand's Glenys Page both achieved the feat as part of their teams' victories over Young England and Trinidad and Tobago respectively. Macpherson and Page are two of only five players to take a five-wicket haul during their WODI debut, the others being India's Purnima Choudhary, Laura Harper of England and Felicity Leydon-Davis from New Zealand.\nSuthershini Sivanantham has taken the most economical five-wicket haul with an economy rate of just 0.21. Bowling for Sri Lanka, she took five wickets for just two runs against Pakistan at Moors Sports Club Ground in Colombo in January 2002. The least economical five-wicket haul was taken by South Africa's Suné Luus with an economy rate of 6.70. Despite Luus taking figures of 5 wickets for 67 runs (5/67) off her 10 overs at the County Ground in Taunton during the 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup, South Africa lost the match to Australia – one of only thirteen occurrences that did not result in a victory to the team taking the five-wicket haul. There have been three occasions where two five-wicket hauls have been taken in the same match. The first was during the 2005 Women's Cricket World Cup in South Africa. India's Neetu David took figures of 5/32 in the first innings with Louise Milliken of New Zealand taking 5/25 to lead her side to victory. The second was during the 2007 Women's European Cricket Championship in Deventer where Annemarie Tanke of the Netherlands finished with 5/40. In reply, Ciara Metcalfe returned career best figures of 5/18 to help steer Ireland to victory. The third was the first ODI of Zimbabwe's 2023 tour of Thailand, which saw Kelis Ndlovu (Zimbabwe, 5/22) and Thipatcha Putthawong (Thailand, 6/6) become the first players to achieve the feat for their respective countries in women's ODIs.\nAnisa Mohammed of the West Indies tops the list as the only bowler to have achieved the feat six times. She is followed by Katherine Brunt of England and South Africa's Suné Luus with five five-wicket hauls, Australian Cathryn Fitzpatrick with four and New Zealand's Holly Huddleston and Ellyse Perry of Australia with three. Fitzpatrick is also the oldest player to achieve to take a fifer, taking her final five-wicket haul seven days short of her 38th birthday. Five bowlers have taken a seven-wicket haul in a WODI, with Pakistan's Sajjida Shah returning the best figures in the format with seven wickets for just four runs. Playing in the 2003 IWCC Trophy against Japan in their debut WODI match, Shah is also the youngest bowler, aged just 15 years and 168 days, to take five wickets in an innings. The other four to take seven wickets in an innings are Jo Chamberlain of England who took 7/8 against Denmark during the 1991 European Women's Cricket Championship; Mohammed who took 7/14 in a player of the match performance to help the West Indies win the final of the 2011 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament against Pakistan, Perry who took 7/22 in the third WODI against England during the 2019 Women's Ashes series and Australia's Shelley Nitschke who finished with 7/24 during the 2005 Women's Ashes series. A further twelve players have taken a six-wicket haul.\n, 125 five-wicket hauls have been taken by 85 different players from over 1,312 WODI matches. England lead the list with 24 five-wicket hauls, followed by New Zealand with 22 and Australia with 20. Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln, New Zealand, leads the list of where the most five-wicket hauls have been taken with nine, ahead of the Derby County Cricket Ground and Grace Road with four each."

Nadal won two Majors (the French Open and US Open), six titles, and ended the year as the world No. 1 for the first time since 2013.\nYear summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nBrisbane International.\nHaving started the 2017 season defending his title in the World Tennis Championship, Nadal played his first competitive tournament of the season in Australia by taking part in the Brisbane International. His first match and win was against Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov. He beat Mischa Zverev in the next round, before losing to top-seed Milos Raonic in the quarter finals. He next played a FAST4 exhibition tournament in Sydney, which was run concurrently with the Apia International Sydney. He lost to Nick Kyrgios in his only match.\nAustralian Open.\nNadal was seeded ninth in the first major of the year, the Australian Open. After two relatively easy rounds against Florian Mayer, and former finalist Marcos Baghdatis, he faced 19-year-old Alexander Zverev in the third round. He prevailed in a five-set match, twice coming back from one set down, after the youngster began suffering cramps in the final set. He defeated the French number one, and world number nine Gaël Monfils in four sets in the fourth round to reach his first quarterfinal since the 2015 French Open. In a rematch against Raonic, he won in straight sets. In the semifinal, he defeated rising Bulgarian star Grigor Dimitrov in a five-set match that lasted just under five hours to reach his first major final since the 2014 French Open. The Australian Open final was the 35th meeting between him and former world number one and long-time rival Roger Federer. Due to their storied rivalry, the advancing age of both players in their respective careers, critical speculation of this being their last Grand Slam finals contest against one another, and the potential tennis history made from either victory and subsequent implications on their respective legacies, the match, referred by the moniker 'Fedal XXXV', was one of the most highly anticipated finals in not only the tournament's history but also all tennis history. The match went to five sets, but despite leading by a break in the final set, Nadal lost the match to Federer (who won his record-extending 18th major title) losing 5 games in a row. It was the first time Nadal lost to Federer at a major outside of Wimbledon, and the first time he lost a Grand slam match to Federer since the Wimbledon 2007 final, won by Federer in 5 sets.\nMexican Open.\nNadal's first scheduled tournament after the Australian Open was to be the Rotterdam Open in Rotterdam. However, he pulled out of this tournament citing fatigue. He decided to play the Mexican Open in Acapulco, and continued his impressive form by reaching the final without the loss of a set. In the first round, he defeated Mischa Zverev for the second time, before winning his second round match against Italian Paolo Lorenzi for the loss of just two games. In the quarterfinal, he eventually closed out Japanese upstart Yoshihito Nishioka despite struggling in the first set. He played eighth-ranked Croatian, Marin Čilić, in the semifinal, winning with the loss of only three games. However, he lost his second consecutive final of the season in two sets to American Sam Querrey.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nIn the first Masters 1000 of the season, the Indian Wells Masters, he was handed a difficult draw due to his low ranking, being placed in the same quarter as his closest rivals, Federer, and Novak Djokovic. He followed his opening round bye with relatively easy straight set victories over Guido Pella, and countryman Fernando Verdasco, before playing Federer once again; the Swiss winning in straight sets this time. He played his first competitive doubles matches of the year, partnering Bernard Tomic. They lost in the second round to the South African-American pairing of Raven Klaasen and Rajeev Ram.\nMiami Open.\nNadal then stayed in the United States to compete in the Miami Open. He won in straight sets against Israeli Dudi Sela, and then beat Philipp Kohlschreiber in three sets, despite winning no games in the first set. Two straight set victories over French doubles-specialist Nicolas Mahut, and Jack Sock took him to his first Masters 1000 semifinal since the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters last year. In the semifinal, he played world number 40, Fabio Fognini; the Italian famous for his comeback victory against Nadal at the 2015 US Open. The two had split their last six matches, but Nadal outclassed him in the first set, before winning a close second set, thereby reaching his fifth Miami Open final and setting up a third meeting between himself and Federer this season. In the final, Nadal lost to Roger Federer, marking his fourth consecutive loss to the Swiss and his fifth final loss in the Miami Open.\nSpring clay court season.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nWith the absence of Federer, the 5th-ranked Nadal, a nine-time former champion at the tournament, was seeded 4th. After an opening round bye, he played British rising star, Kyle Edmund, in his first competitive match on clay this season. Despite winning the first set comprehensively, Nadal had to overcome a shaky second set to win the match in three sets. Nadal fared better in his next match with Alexander Zverev, winning for the loss of just two games. Nadal took on Diego Schwartzman in the quarterfinal and despite a less-dominant display, rallied to win the match in straight sets. In the semifinal, Nadal made light work of David Goffin to reach his 11th Monte-Carlo final, with Goffin visibly affected by an incorrect line call. He won his first title of the year, and a record 10th Monte-Carlo Masters title by beating compatriot Albert Ramos Viñolas in the final in straight sets, and thus, became the first man in the Open Era to win a single tournament 10 times. The title was also his 50th on clay courts, surpassing the Open Era record for most clay titles previously held by Guillermo Vilas (49 titles). It was also his 29th ATP Masters 1000 title, one short of Novak Djokovic's all-time record of 30 ATP Masters 1000 titles.\nBarcelona Open.\nFresh from a landmark victory in Monte Carlo, Nadal proceeded to the Barcelona Open where he was seeded 3rd, and received a bye into the second round. He defeated Brazilian journeyman, Rogério Dutra Silva, for the loss of just three games, before beating Kevin Anderson. In his quarterfinal match, Nadal initially struggled against the upstart Korean, Chung Hyeon, before pulling through. Rafa managed to reach the finals with a straight set victory over Horacio Zeballos in the semifinals. A week after clinching his tenth title at Monte Carlo, he replicated that achievement at Barcelona, dominating Dominic Thiem in the final, winning in straight sets to grab his 10th title in Barcelona. The title was Nadal's record 18th ATP World Tour 500 title, his 71st tour-level crown and 51st on clay.\nMadrid Open.\nUnbeaten on clay so far, Nadal proceeded to participate in the Madrid Open where he was seeded 4th. After an opening round bye, his second round match against Italian Fabio Fognini lasted three hours, with Nadal winning in three tight sets. He won his third round match versus the big-serving Australian, Nick Kyrgios, fairly easily; the Australian playing his first competitive tournament on clay this year. In a rematch of their Monte-Carlo semifinal, Nadal played David Goffin in the quarterfinal. Nadal won in straight sets yet again, and booked a semifinal clash with longtime nemesis and rival, World No. 2 Novak Djokovic for the 50th time in their careers. Nadal was riding a seven-match losing streak (15 consecutive sets) to the struggling Serb coming into the match. Their contrasting form continued as Nadal won in straight sets, losing just six games, for a spot in the final. The win improved Nadal's head-to-head record with Djokovic to 24–26. In the final, Nadal played Dominic Thiem for the second straight final. After saving two set points in the opening set tiebreak, Nadal recovered to win his third straight title of the season, and his fifth Madrid Open title by winning the final in straight sets. With the win, Nadal tied Djokovic's record of 30 ATP World Tour Masters 1000 singles titles.\nItalian Open.\nBidding for a 4th consecutive title of the season and riding a 15-match winning streak, Nadal was seeded 4th and received a bye into the second round in the Italian International. He reached the third round after compatriot Nicolás Almagro retired after three games with an apparent knee injury. A straight sets victory over American 13th seed, Jack Sock pushed him to his ninth consecutive quarterfinal in Rome. For the third tournament in a row, Nadal faced Dominic Thiem, this time in the quarterfinal, but his 17–match winning streak was put to an end with a straight sets loss to the young Austrian.\nFrench Open.\nDespite being seeded 4th, Nadal came to the second Grand Slam of the year possessing a 17–1 win–loss record on clay for the season, and as a heavy favourite to win his 10th Roland-Garros title. His strong form continued, as he easily defeated home favourite Benoît Paire, and Dutchman Robin Haase, in the first two rounds. In the third round against top-ranked Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili, Nadal produced an absolute masterclass, winning the match for the loss of a sole game in the second set. In an all-Spanish affair in the fourth round, Nadal made light work of 17th-seed Roberto Bautista Agut, who managed to take just five games off the former champion. In the quarterfinal, another all-Spanish clash beckoned, Nadal facing Pablo Carreño Busta this time. After a dominant display in the first set, Nadal moved into the semifinals as his compatriot withdrew with an abdominal problem early in the second set. Bidding to reach his tenth final in Paris, and seventh final of the season, Nadal met Dominic Thiem in the semifinal. In the latest chapter to their budding rivalry, Nadal avenged his sole loss of the clay court season, as he beat the Austrian to reach the final. Having lost just 29 games on his road to the final, Nadal faced a Swiss for the second consecutive Slam final, this time World No. 3, Stan Wawrinka. In the final, Nadal continued his outstanding form, defeating Wawrinka to win \"La Décima\" (Spanish: the tenth; first used during Real Madrid's 2014 UEFA Champions League victory, and subsequently in the buildup to Nadal's 10th titles at Monte-Carlo, Barcelona, and Paris) at the French Open and consigning the Swiss to his first loss in a Slam final. With this landmark victory, Nadal became the first person in the Open Era to win 10 titles in single Grand Slam event. Nadal won the tournament for the loss of 35 games, thereby marking it as the second best performance, in terms of games lost, by a male tennis player in winning a Grand Slam singles title right after Björn Borg, who lost 32 games at the 1978 Roland-Garros. Nadal also passed Pete Sampras for sole second on the men's Grand Slam singles title list with the victory, his 15 titles only second to Roger Federer's 18 (since 20). It was also Nadal's 73rd Tour title, which ranks him 6th highest in the Open Era, one behind Rod Laver.\nGrass court season.\nNadal entered the grass court season not having played a match on grass since his loss to Dustin Brown in the 2015 Wimbledon Championships. He was scheduled to play the Aegon Championships, however withdrew citing a need for rest. Instead of an official tournament, Nadal played two matches in an exhibition tournament at The Hurlingham Club in London before his Wimbledon campaign, losing to Tomáš Berdych, but later defeating Tommy Haas.\nWimbledon.\nNadal was seeded 4th behind Federer, Djokovic and Murray for Wimbledon despite being ranked No. 2 and was in contention for the world No. 1 ranking at the start of the tournament. He began his campaign to win a 3rd Wimbledon title by defeating Australia's John Millman in straight sets. In the round of 32, Nadal dominated the No. 30-seed, Karen Khachanov, defeating him in straight sets and bringing his streak to 28 consecutive grand slam sets won, which equaled his previous best and is the 3rd longest in the Open Era. On 10 July 2017, Nadal faced Gilles Müller in the round of 16 and after forcing a fifth set from 2 sets down, Nadal then saved 4 match points in the deciding set, but came up short on the fifth match point, losing 15-13 in the final set.\nNorth American hard court season.\nCanadian Open.\nNadal opened his campaign by beating Borna Ćorić in 2R but went on to lose his 3R encounter against 18 year old Canadian Denis Shapovalov. With this early exit, his chance to get back to top spot halted. Had he reached semifinals, he would have become the world No. 1.\nCincinnati Masters.\nDue to the last minute withdrawal of Roger Federer, Rafa ascended to the world No. 1-ranking for the 4th time in his career on 21 August 2017, his 142nd week at the pinnacle of men's tennis. With only 370 points to defend for the rest of 2017, there is a strong possibility that he can finish year-end No. 1 for a 4th separate stint (only two other players have ever finished year-end No. 1 in separate stints, but Federer and Ivan Lendl have only done it in 2 separate stints). Nadal was the No. 1 seed and began his campaign against Frenchman Richard Gasquet. Rafa defeated Gasquet in straight sets, improved his head-to-head record to 15-0 and has now won their last 25 consecutive sets. Due to heavy rain, Nadal was required to play 2 matches in a day, dispatching Albert Ramos in straight sets only to be sent packing by Nick Kyrgios in straight sets later on. Despite this loss, Nadal still was ranked No.1 in the following week.\nUS Open.\nNadal was seeded No.1 in a grand slam for the first time since the 2014 French Open. Rafa opened the last major of the year against 85th-ranked Serbian Dušan Lajović whom he dismissed in straight sets. In the round of 64, Nadal faced Taro Daniel of Japan and despite trailing by a set and a break, he dispatched Daniel with the loss of just 7 games in the last three sets combined. Lucky loser Leonardo Mayer was up next for Nadal and for the second consecutive match, Rafa started slow and lost the first set in a tie break only to secure the next three sets to move into a round of 16 showdown with Alexandr Dolgopolov. Nadal advanced to his first US Open quarterfinal since he won his second US Open crown in 2013 with a dominant straight sets win in just over an hour and a half. His quarterfinal opponent would be NextGen 19-year old Andrey Rublev of Russia who grew up idolizing Nadal. Nadal successfully defeated the rising star in a one-sided match lasting only 96 minutes with the loss of just 5 games. He next faces Juan Martín del Potro who defeated Federer in 4 sets in the QF, preventing another Federer–Nadal meeting in the US Open and thus allowing Nadal to retain his No.1 ranking. He defeated del Potro in four sets to reach his 23rd major final where he faced Kevin Anderson. Nadal clinches his 16th Grand Slam title and 3rd USO title beating Anderson in straight sets, and also his first hardcourt singles title since Doha 2014. This victory brought him closer to 3 short of Federer's 19 major titles. This win also secured a fourth season where Federer and Nadal won all the Grand Slams (2006, 2007, 2010, 2017).\nAsian swing.\nChina Open.\nNadal opened his Asian swing with a tough draw at the Beijing Open, saving two match points in the 2nd set tiebreak to beat Lucas Pouille in his opening round match. He breezed through his next 2 matches against Karen Khachanov and big-serving John Isner in straight sets to set a blockbuster semifinal with Grigor Dimitrov. Nadal won the semifinal in three sets before defeating Nick Kyrgios in straight sets to win his 75th career title and 2nd title at Beijing following his 2005 crown. It was also Nadal's Tour-leading 6th title of the season and separated him from Roger Federer and Alexander Zverev who each have 5 titles this season. This was Rafa's 2nd consecutive hard court title after losing his last 8 consecutive hard court finals.\nShanghai Masters.\nNadal continued his run of form in the Shanghai Masters, reaching the quarterfinals with the loss of only 7 games against Jared Donaldson and Fabio Fognini. In the quarterfinals, he defeated Grigor Dimitrov for the 2nd time in 2 weeks in three tight sets to reach the semifinals where he faced Marin Čilić, winning the encounter in two grueling sets after saving two set points in the first set, reaching his 10th final of the year and 3rd consecutive tournament final. Nadal was beaten in straight sets by nemesis Roger Federer in the final, ending his winning streak of 16 matches and also marking his 5th consecutive loss to Federer for the first time in their 38 rivalry meetings.\nEuropean indoor hard court season.\nParis Masters.\nFollowing Federer's withdrawal from the final Masters 1000 tournament, Nadal clinched the year-end No.1 ranking for the 4th time in his career, also becoming the oldest man to finish the year on top of the rankings since its formation in 1973 at the age of 31, after beating Hyeon Chung in his first match in straight sets. Having previously finished at the top in 2008, 2010 and 2013, Nadal becomes the first player to hold, lose and regain the year-end No. 1 on three occasions. He also became the first player to finish No. 1 four times in non-consecutive years, the first aged over-30 and the first to finish in the top spot four years since he last achieved the feat (2013). The nine-year gap between his first year-end No. 1 season (2008) and his last (2017) is also a record.\nNadal managed to reach quarterfinals by beating Pablo Cuevas in the next round, but withdrew from the tournament due to an injured right knee.\nATP World Tour Finals.\nNadal' s final event of the year was at the ATP World Tour Finals. His first round robin match was against David Goffin. Nadal struggled with his knee injury, and ended up losing the match in three tight sets.

        "text": "Michael Melford (born 1984) is a retired English rugby union player who plays as a winger. He has spent most of his semi-professional rugby career with Canterbury during the most successful spell of the clubs career to date, which included a spell as club captain. With over 90 tries for his club in National League 2 South alone, he has become one of the most prolific try scorers in the competition's history. He currently runs a personal training business in Chatham, Kent.\nCareer.\nRise and Fall of Canterbury.\nAfter graduating from Loughborough University, Mike joined Canterbury in Kent in 2005, where he enjoyed a successful first season at the club as they won both the London Division 1 league title and retained the Kent Cup. The 2006–07 season saw the club finish 4th in National Division 3 South (excellent for a promoted side) with Mike playing all 26 games, scoring 16 tries in the process. The club also won the Kent Cup for the third year running, with Mike featuring as his side defeated Blackheath 41–27 in the final held at Maidstone rugby club. The next season finished in much the same way, with Canterbury once again finishing 4th in the league and winning the Kent Cup for the fourth year running.\nThe 2008–09 season saw Mike have one of his most prolific spells of his career with the club as he finished the second highest try scorer in the division with 22 tries from just 23 games, with Canterbury finishing 5th in the league. After a fairly low-key 2009–10 season, 2011–12 proved to be bittersweet for Mike.On the one hand he managed a career best total of 23 tries in National 3 South, but on the other it was for a relegated side as Canterbury went down at the end of the season, losing their final game at home to relegation rivals Westcombe Park, 18–25, condemning them to the drop, just 1 point off safety. At the end of the season Mike's try scoring exploits would lead him to be called up for the Kent county team taking part in the 2011 County Championships, although this too was a disappointment as Kent were relegated from Division 1 of the competition.\nReturn to the National Leagues.\nAlthough Canterbury were relegated from the National Leagues, Mike stayed at the club and was made captain in June 2011, replacing Chris Hinkins who became player-coach. His debut season as captain was a successful one as Canterbury took National League 3 South-West by storm, winning 24 out of 26 games to win the league title and promotion back to National League 2 South. The 2012–13 season would be his last with Canterbury as the newly promoted side finished mid-table, with Mike scoring 5 tries from 19 appearances to bow out after 8 seasons with the club.\nHonours and records.\nCanterbury\nKent\nInternational/Representative"

This was the 15th season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held and is the 68th year overall where an NCAA school fielded a team.\nThis was the premier season for ECAC Hockey which began as a conglomerate of 28 eastern schools among which 8 teams were selected by a committee to participate in a postseason tournament that would determine which university(s) would receive bids to the NCAA tournament. Due to the sheer number of schools and the lack of any scheduling criteria the teams played a vastly unbalanced schedule. As a result, the regular season standings were effectively immaterial in determining the conference tournament participants and the committee based their selections on which teams they felt were the best representatives.\nDespite already being in the Tri-State League Clarkson, Rensselaer and St. Lawrence were also founding members of ECAC Hockey and played concurrently in both conferences until the Tri-State League folded in 1972.\nThis was the first season for Minnesota–Duluth as a university sponsored program.\nPlayer stats.\nScoring leaders.\nThe following players led the league in points at the conclusion of the season.\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nLeading goaltenders.\nThe following goaltenders led the league in goals against average at the end of the regular season while playing at least 33% of their team's total minutes.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; OT = Overtime/shootout losses; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\""

        "text": "Andrew Frost (born 1983) is a retired English rugby union player who played mostly at fullback A former Saracens Academy player and England youth international, Andy made his name with Southend. An excellent spot kicker who could also score tries, he scored over 1,700 points for the Essex club, also becoming one of the most prolific scorers of all-time in National League 2 South. He retired in 2015 due to injury.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nAndy started his rugby career with the Saracens Academy before moving to Gloucester in 2002. While at Gloucester he made appearances for the second team as well as for England at under-21 level but suffered a dislocated shoulder which curtailed his progress. Unable to make the Gloucester first team, Andy dropped several divisions to play for Bracknell in National Division Two during the 2004 – 05 season. Initially understudy to Neil Hallett (until he left part way through the season to join Esher), Andy became the main man at the Berkshire club making 19 appearances and finishing in the top ten league points scorers with 172 points. Despite his efforts he was unable to keep Bracknell up as they were relegated at the end of the season, just 3 points clear from safety.\nSouthend RFC.\nFor the 2005 – 06 season, Andy returned to his boyhood county Essex to join Southend playing in National Division 3 South. Southend had struggled somewhat the previous season but they would finish the year in a respectable 6th place, thanks to Andy's accuracy from the tee as he ended up the division's top point's scorer with 258 points. The 2007 – 08 season was even better as Southend ended up as league champions and gained promotion to National Division Two (the highest level the club had reached in its history), with Andy once again the league's top scorer with a massive 335 points.\nLife in National 2 was tougher for the promoted but they managed to stay in the division and Andy continued his fine form by finishing as the second top scorer in the league with 282 (just four points behind the top scorer, Gareth Wynne). Southend suffered second season syndrome the next year in what was a very competitive National 2. With the RFU looking to implement widespread divisional changes the league would have four going down that season instead of the usual three. In the end Southend finished way off safety and were relegated in 12th place with Andy being injured at the latter end of the season.\nBack in (the newly named) National League 2 South, Southend prevented a free-fall down the divisions by finishing 4th for the 2009 – 10 season with Andy scoring regularly once he had returned from injury. The next year saw Andy score 330 points in a Southend side that finished 4th once again. The next couple of seasons would see Southend start to slide down to occupy a mid-table position in the league and Andy started to get less and less game time.\nDorking RFC.\nFor the 2013–14 season, Andy dropped down a division to join ambitious Surrey side, Dorking, playing in National League 3 London &amp; SE. He had a fantastic debut season with his new side, playing in almost every game and scoring regularly as they finished as champions and gained promotion to National League 2 South. Unfortunately Andy's next season would be his last as he suffered a shoulder injury in the first game of the new season – ironically against former club Southend in a game his side won 18–13 with Andy scoring all 18 points.\nHonours and records.\nSouthend\nDorking\nInternational"

        "text": "Connor Williams (born May 12, 1997) is an American football center who is a free agent. He played college football at Texas.\nEarly years.\nWilliams attended Coppell High School. As a freshman, he started the last 3 games at right tackle. As a sophomore, he was moved to tight end, but by the end of the season he was switched to left tackle.\nAs a senior, he was a two-way player, allowing one sack and one holding penalty, while making 38 tackles (5 for loss), 3 sacks, 5 quarterback pressures, 5 forced fumbles and 2 passes defensed. He was a second-team 6A All-State and an All-district selection.\nHe was a teammate of future NFL player Solomon Thomas. He also practiced basketball.\nCollege career.\nWilliams accepted a football scholarship from the University of Texas. As a freshman, he started all 12 games at left tackle.\nThe next year, he started 11 out of 12 games at left tackle and was considered by the media and coaches one of the best offensive tackles in college football. He became just the fourth sophomore in school history to receive consensus first-team All-American honors.\nAs a junior, he suffered a left knee injury in the third game against USC. He returned to play in the eleventh game against West Virginia University. He started only five out of 12 games at left tackle (first 3 and final 2 regular season contests). On November 27, 2017, Williams announced that he would forgo his senior year in favor of the 2018 NFL Draft, and that he would not play in the 2017 Texas Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nWilliams was selected by Dallas Cowboys in the second round (50th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft, with the intention of playing him at guard. He was named the starting left guard, starting the first eight games before being benched in Week 10 in favor of Xavier Su'a-Filo. He then started two games at right guard in place of an injured Zack Martin.\nIn 2019, he entered the season as the Cowboys starting left guard. He started 11 games, missing one due to arthroscopic knee surgery, before suffering a torn ACL in Week 13. He was placed on injured reserve on December 1, 2019.\nIn 2020, he was able to recover from a torn ACL to start all 16 games at left guard for the first time in his career, missing just one snap on offense (in the season opener). He also had to adjust to four different starting quarterbacks during the season.\nIn 2021, although he was tried briefly at center during training camp, he remained at his traditional left guard position. His play regressed during the first 10 weeks, when he led the league with 13 penalties (8 for holding). He was benched the next 4 games in favor of third-year guard Connor McGovern. As a backup, he was able to show his versatility when he suited up at fullback in one game. He got his starting position back in Week 15, but struggled in the final five games of the season, ranking second in the league with 15 penalties (13 for holding). He also had problems in the Wild Card playoff loss against the San Francisco 49ers, receiving 2 key penalties. He still managed to finish the year with the fewest pressures allowed by any Cowboy offensive lineman to start a game and surrendered only one sack.\nMiami Dolphins.\nOn March 17, 2022, Williams signed a two-year $14 million contract with the Miami Dolphins. He was switched to center and named the starter over Michael Deiter during organized team activities. He started in all 17 games, allowing 3 sacks and 6 penalties. He was the only player to participate in 100 percent of the offensive snaps (1,057) for the team.\nOn June 6, 2023, Williams was not present for mandatory mini-camp with the Dolphins.

        "text": "USA Water Polo is the leading body for the sport of water polo in the United States and is a member of the United States Aquatic Sports. USA Water Polo is responsible for fielding U.S. national teams and hosts 20 annual tournaments. The Organization is headquartered in Irvine, California.\nHistory.\nUSA Water Polo was formed in 1978 after a new law designated the United States Olympic Committee as the governing body for all Olympic activity in the United States. Water polo in the United States had previously been controlled by the Amateur Athletic Union. The organization is now responsible for overall Olympic development.\nThe U.S. has fielded a women's national team since the 1970s. Tina Bejarano, Lara Ruiz, Carmen Bejarano, Debbie Powell, Desiree Zepeda and Anabel Barragon played on a team from Commerce, California during this era. The team has participated in every Olympic Games since the inaugural women's competition in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, and have medalled in all five tournaments, winning the last three.\nNational teams.\nThe United States men's team has participated in Olympic water polo since the 1904 Games in St. Louis, the second Olympic Games to host a water polo tournament. The 1904 squad won the gold medal, the only gold the US men have earned in water polo. Since 1904, the US has won another six Olympic medals (1924, 1932, 1972, 1984, 1988, 2008). The United States women's team has competed in every tournament since the inaugural 2000 edition, winning a medal in each, including three consecutive victories in 2012–2021.\nUSA Water Polo also oversees junior, 18U, and 16U national teams.\nRacial Equity &amp; Reform Task Force.\nIn June 2020, USA Water Polo announced it was forming a task force to work on racial justice issues as well as expanding access to the sport. Four-time olympic champion Brenda Villa was selected alongside executive John Abdou.\nWashington Wetskins.\nThe Washington Wetskins, an organization affiliated with USA Water Polo, is the oldest LGBT friendly water polo team in the United States and the world. The Washington Wetskins welcomed women as well as men on their team. As of 2018, the organization had over 80 members. In 2020, the team changed their name to the Washington DSeahorses Water Polo Club. DSeahorse members have to be USA Water Polo members in order to play on the team.\nControversy.\nIn June 2021, USA Water Polo and a California club settled a $14 million lawsuit that had been filed against them by several female water polo players who accused their coach Bahram Hojreh of sexual misconduct. USA Water Polo stated it suspended the coach when it first obtained reports about his alleged abuse in January 2018 from the United States Center for SafeSport, but the organization was cautioned for allegedly failing to inform law enforcement at the time as required under California law and the SafeSport code."

This was the 12th season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held and is the 65th year overall where an NCAA school fielded a team.\nAfter the previous season the WIHL dissolved due to an argument between member universities over recruiting practices, namely the tendency of Colorado College, Denver and North Dakota to recruit overage Canadian players. In time the practice would eventually lead to Denver's appearance in the 1973 tournament being vacated but rules prohibiting such recruits did not exist at the time. Due to the dissolution of the WIHL the three schools belonging to the Big Ten Conference formed their own ice hockey division.\nPlayer stats.\nScoring leaders.\nThe following players led the league in points at the conclusion of the season.\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nLeading goaltenders.\nThe following goaltenders led the league in goals against average at the end of the regular season while playing at least 33% of their team's total minutes.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; OT = Overtime/shootout losses; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\""

        "title": "China Badminton Super League",
        "text": "The China Badminton Super League (CBSL) () is the prime National team competition for badminton players in China. The China Badminton Super League was re-launched in 2009 after a failing attempt seven years earlier. \nLiu Fengyan, director of the Table Tennis and Badminton Administration Center under China's State General Administration of Sport, announced the re-launch during the 50th anniversary meeting of the Chinese Badminton Association.\nThe China Badminton Super League (CBSL) has welcomed huge sponsorship deals hereby attracting top players from China and abroad to the participating teams.\nFormat.\nThe China Badminton Super League is a mixed team event, like the Sudirman Cup. After the inaugural first season the league was divided into two round-robin stages and then a final elimination stage. The clubs will be placed according to points accumulated by the end of this stage. After the inaugural season eight clubs were selected. Later from 2012 twelve clubs participated divided into two round-robin groups of each six clubs and from 2015 on the competition was back to eight teams.\nIn the round-robins, each of the participating clubs will be playing against every other club twice, once on their home courts, and the other on their opponent's. \nNext, in the elimination stage, the first four ranking teams in the round-robins will be placed in a group, equaling to the semifinal. At first the bottom four were also placed in another group, fighting for a better placing from among fifth to eighth spot. Like in the round-robins, at first the semifinalists had to play twice, once in each club's home courts. An extra round would be played if the teams end up with a tie. But from 2015 on a single semi-final tie was played. Also once a team had already won the first three matches in a tie, each game in the following matches would only be played to 11 points instead of 21. Later this was also eliminated when a tie was decided in the final stages no further match was played.\nFrom the 2013 season the CBSL competition rules were significantly changed. First, the 21-point games was scrapped in favor of a greatly scaled down 11-point system in order to reduce the duration of each competition to meet the requirement of live telecasts. By this means, the CBSL organization committee was able to convince sports channel CCTV to broadcast some focus competitions both in the group and knock-out stages. With live telecasts, commercial prospects for the CBSL seem much brighter and this may have attracted more and more financial supports from business enterprises. The scoring change had also created more uncertainty and suspense for each match.\nSecond, they introduced mixed three-on-three into the team competition. 3-on-3 was originally used as a training drill inside national team to enhance the reaction speed of doubles players. With three players on each side, the speed and pace of the match is very quick and exciting. From 2013 till 2015 each competition included 5 matches: men's singles, women's singles, and mixed 3-on-3 match which were fixed, while another two matches alternated among men's doubles, mixed doubles and women's doubles.\nA third alteration was the addition of one amateur men's doubles match before the start of each competition. In an attempt to increase public involvement and interaction with the CBSL, the players were selected from local amateur events. As members of the clubs they were rewarded with some training courses. By playing in the CBSL events, the players could earn points of CBA amateur ranking system or even prizes if their performances were good enough.\nFrom 2015 on the above-mentioned changes were turned around again by the organizers of the CBSL to the normal Sudirman Cup format and the normal 21 point scoring system.\n2009 season.\n2009 was the inaugural season for the China Badminton Super League.\nOnly in this first season a total of 14 teams participated in the preliminary qualification stage. Ultimately only 8 of these teams then took part in the main stage of the CBSL.\nThe 14 teams originally taking part in the preliminary rounds in the first 2009 season were: \nThe top teams of each of the four groups entered the semifinals. The four teams that went to the semifinals were 81 Chivas, Jiangsu Yonex, Hubei and home-team Guangzhou where the ties took place. In the first semi-final, Jiangsu beat Hubei 3-0. In the second semi-final 81 Chivas beat Guangzhou 3-0. In the final the strong and powerful Jiangsu Yonex team beat 81 Chivas with 3-0. The 2009 CBSL championship team of Jiangsu Yonex included top players like Wang Shixian, Tao Jiaming, Sun Xiaoli, Cheng Shu, Tang Jinhua, Li Yu, Zhi Luoliang, Cai Yun, Xu Chen and Lu Lan.\nBased on the results of the inaugural first year's CBSL competition, 8 clubs were selected to play in the next 2010 China Badminton Club Super League in a new home and away system.\n2010 season.\nThe 2010 season started with a round-robin system for the 8 participating teams. \nThere were a few unique rules in the China Badminton Super League from 2010:\n1. Teams placed fourth and fifth at the end of the round-robins had to fight in a PK round where the winner proceeded as the fourth team, joining the semifinal match, while the loser fell to the fifth-to-eighth placing group.\n2. The first-placing team in the round-robins will pick a semi-final opponent from either the third or fourth placing team. While the winners proceed into the finals, the defeated team with a higher placing in the round-robins will be placed third, and the lower one placed fourth. Aside from that, the seventh-placing team in the round-robins will also pick an opponent from the teams placed fifth and sixth. The four teams in this group will only play one elimination match each. The two winning teams will be placed fifth and sixth according to their placing in the round-robins, and the defeated teams placed seventh and eighth under the same rule.\n3. The team placed eighth at the end of the league will play a match against the champion of the National A-Grade One League, where the winner earns a chance to play in the coming China Super League with the loser dropping-out.\nThe composition of the players from each team in the 2010 China Badminton Super League are shown below;\nGuangzhou:\nDoubles: Guo Zhendong, Hong Wei, Gan Zhaolong, Zhang Jinkang, Zhang Jiewen, Zhong Qianxin\nSingles: Wang Zhengming, Liu Xin\nHubei:\nDoubles: Yu Yang, Wang Xiaoli, Rao Yuqiang, Ding Yang, Li Rui, Zhao Yunlei, Li Junyang\nSingles: Li Wen, Wen Kai, Chen Yuekun\nHunan:\nDoubles: Zheng Bo, Tian Qing, Xia Huan, Chai Biao, Zhang Wen, Liu Peixuan, Bao Yixin\nSingles: Shi Xiaoqian, Bao Chunlai, Chen Xiaojia\nJiangsu:\nDoubles: Tang Jinhua, Cheng Shu, Cai Yun, Xu Chen, Tao Jiaming, Sun Xiaoli\nSingles: Lu Lan, Wang Shixian, Chen Jin, Li Yu, Qiu Yanbo\nBayi BC - PLA (Chinese People's Liberation Army):\nDoubles: He Hanbin, Feng Chen, Pan Pan, Li Xuerui, He Hangqing, Li Gen\nSingles: Lin Dan, Jiang Yanjiao\nZhejiang:\nDoubles: Sang Yan, Zhang Nan, Zhang Yawen, Zhou Hui\nSingles: Wang Lin, Du Pengyu, Huang Yuxiang\nQingdao:\nDoubles: Qiu Zihan, Ma Jin, Du Jing, Fu Haifeng, Shen Ye, Luo Yu\nSingles: Zhou Wenlong, Wang Xin, Liu Jingru\nShanghai:\nDoubles: Chen Zhiben, Xie Jing, Liu Yingchun, Yu Hao, Yu Junjie, Shi Hong, Hu Minyu\nSingles: Chen Long, Wang Yihan, Zhu Lin, Lu Qicheng\nAfter almost two months of playing, the year's 2010 Chinese Badminton Super League came to an end. The year's two finalists were Qingdao and Hunan. Qingdao was expected to be in the final as they finished in the top 3 after the second round robin stage. In the semifinals against Jiangsu, they were defeated 3:2 whereas Qingdao won by a bigger margin at home, 3:0. As each club won once, they had to play a rubber tie and Qingdao defeated Jiangsu 3:0 to advance to the final.\nIn the other semi-final, Hunan, the dark horse, defeated Bayi BC, the 81st post of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (the strongest club led by Lin Dan and Jiang Yanjiao). Chinese People's Liberation Army was ranked first after the second round robin stage. In the semifinals, Hunan lost to Chinese People's Liberation Army 1:3 at home whilst Chinese People's Liberation Army lost to Hunan 2:3 at home. As each club won once, they also had to play a tie. At last, Hunan defeated Chinese People's Liberation Army 3:1 with the absence of Lin Dan in the tie. Qingdao beat Hunan 3:2 in the first leg of the final. After also winning the second leg of the final of the China Badminton Super League with a convincing 3:1 win from Qingdao over Hunan, the 2010 championship title was sealed. Shanghai ended up as the weakest team during the 2010 league as they never won a tie. They lost 18 out of 18 matches they had played. According to league regulations, Shanghai had to compete with the champion of the Badminton League One to decide whether they still could stay and play in next year's Chinese Badminton Super League.\nFinal Team ranking 2010 CBSL:\n1st – Qingdao – GOLD,\n2nd – Hunan – SILVER,\n3rd – Jiangsu, &amp; (Bayi BC) PLA - Chinese People's Liberation Army – (both teams) BRONZE,\n5th – Zhejiang,\n6th – Guangzhou,\n7th – Hubei,\n8th – Shanghai – had to play for relegation\n2011 season.\nThe 2011 CBSL season started with the round-robin system for the 8 participating teams.

According to the league's regulations, a team is declared champion if placed top of the list twice at the end of both cycles. If a different team grabs the first place in the second cycle, the team with a higher ranking within top four in the other cycle wins.\nWith a #1 finish in the first cycle, the Qingdao versus Hunan match was the utmost deciding match for the former team, who were still fighting for the last ticket into the top four of the second cycle, hoping to grab the final victory of the league. If first cycle's runner-up Hunan had won, it would have been a taste of victory for them instead, while Qingdao would have fallen off to the 7th place in the cycle, ending the season only as the second runner-up.\nHunan, on the other hand, who ended up second in both cycles, became the league's runner-up again as they did last year. While Bayi, the club under the lead of Lin Dan shared the same luck, ending up as the second runner-up yet again.\nFinal results:\n1st (Winner): QINGDAO Beer - GOLD,\n2nd (Runner-up): HUNAN Xiangcai Securities - SILVER,\n3rd (2nd Runner-up): BAYI Dongling Refineries - BRONZE,\n4th place: WUHAN Hubei Autocity,\n5th place: ZHEJIANG Yinjiang,\n6th place: GUANGZHOU Yueyu,\n7th place: JIANGSU Yonex,\n8th place: SHANGHAI Zi Wei Ke\n2012 season.\nThe 2012 CBSL season started with a new round-robin system for a total of 12 participating teams.

        "title": "AFC Wimbledon–Milton Keynes Dons F.C. rivalry",
        "text": "The rivalry between AFC Wimbledon and Milton Keynes Dons arose from the formation of both clubs due to the relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes. For many years the two clubs played at different levels of English football, with the first competitive fixture between them taking place on 2 December 2012 - a second round FA Cup tie in which the two clubs were drawn against one another.\nFollowing AFC Wimbledon's promotion to the Football League, and subsequent promotion to League One in 2016, fixtures between the two clubs have taken place regularly.\nThe rivalry was named as one of \"5 of the fiercest rivalries in the Football League\" and one of the \"8 biggest derbies in the EFL\" by commentators. A 2019 study ranked the rivalry 22nd out of the top 30 derbies in all of English football. The fixture has been labelled \"one of football's biggest grudge games\".\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nWimbledon Football Club relocated to Milton Keynes in September 2003, 16 months after receiving permission to do so from the Football Association on the basis of a two-to-one decision in favour by an FA-appointed independent commission. The move took the team from south London, where they had been based since their foundation in 1889, to Milton Keynes, a new city in Buckinghamshire, about to the northwest of the club's traditional home district Wimbledon. Hugely controversial, the move's authorisation prompted disaffected Wimbledon supporters to form AFC Wimbledon, a new club, in June 2002. The relocated team played home matches in Milton Keynes under the Wimbledon name from September 2003 until June 2004, when following the end of the 2003–04 season they renamed themselves Milton Keynes Dons F.C. (MK Dons).\nFirst encounter.\nOn 14 November 2012, the two clubs were drawn to play against each other for the first time in a second round FA Cup tie which would take place on 2 December 2012. At the time, MK Dons were an established League One club, and AFC Wimbledon a League Two club having achieved promotion from the Conference National in 2011. MK Dons were drawn as the home team, with the fixture being played at the club's home ground of Stadium MK. The tie was accompanied by worldwide press attention and was selected for live coverage by television networks around the world as well as being chosen for broadcast by ITV domestically in the UK.\nWimbledon Independent Supporters Association, representing fans of AFC Wimbledon, initially considered encouraging their supporters to boycott the fixture, but later released a statement suggesting individual supporters made an \"informed decision\" as to whether they attended or not. AFC Wimbledon chief executive Erik Samuelson stated that following discussions with the club's owners, board members would not accept hospitality at Stadium MK on the day of the fixture.\nA crowd of 16,459 including several thousand AFC Wimbledon supporters eventually attended the match. The first half saw little action, but on the stroke of half-time it was the home side that took the lead with a 25-yard strike from midfielder Stephen Gleeson. \nAfter the break, chances for both sides followed. On the 59th-minute, AFC Wimbledon equalised through striker Jack Midson's header, and almost took the lead themselves when Steven Gregory's shot produced a save from MK Dons' goalkeeper David Martin. The match ended in dramatic fashion when on the 93rd-minute, substitute Jon Otsemobor's was struck by the ball on the back of his boot, resulting in a last gasp 2–1 victory for Milton Keynes Dons. Supporters of the club later dubbed the freak goal, the \"Heel of God\".\nNotable subsequent encounters.\nThe first encounter between the two clubs to take place at AFC Wimbledon's (then) home ground of Kingsmeadow took place on 14 March 2017. The fixture was a League One match between the two that took place during the 2016–17 season as a result of AFC Wimbledon's promotion from League Two the previous season. This was the first season in which the two clubs would meet at the same level of the English football league system. The match was played in front of a heated atmosphere between both groups of fans. Following a stalemate in the first half, AFC Wimbledon midfielder Jake Reeves struck just after the hour mark before striker Lyle Taylor added a second soon after to seal the victory. The match ended 2–0 to the home side.\nOn 30 January 2021 the first fixture between the two clubs at AFC Wimbledon's new Plough Lane stadium took place, albeit without spectators in attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Milton Keynes Dons emerged from the encounter as 2–0 winners.\nIn the first contest between the two clubs in front of fans at Plough Lane on 2 March 2024, AFC Wimbledon secured a 1-0 victory following a last-gasp goal from Ronan Curtis in the final minute of added time. Tempers flared at the final whistle with staff and players from both clubs having to be separated by the referee.\nControversies.\nDue to the rivalry between the two clubs, there have been a number of controversies and incidents over the years, both on and off the pitch.\nDuring the first fixture between the two clubs at Stadium MK on 2 December 2012, a small plane chartered by AFC Wimbledon supporters flew over the stadium several times flying a banner which read \"We are Wimbledon\". Following the fixture, a local newspaper reported that the visiting AFC Wimbledon supporters were responsible for damage caused to \"seating, toilet and refreshment facilities\" within the stadium.\nThere were security concerns ahead of the first fixture to take place between the two clubs at AFC Wimbledon's (then) home ground of Kingsmeadow on 14 March 2017. Due to the street layout surrounding the venue there were safety concerns that groups of opposing supports would clash. Only 650 tickets were allocated to visiting fans. Following consultation between the police and the two clubs it was agreed the match would be designated as a \"bubble fixture\" with visiting MK Dons supporters only allowed to travel to the match via mandatory coach travel arranged by the club. On arrival, visiting supporters were then escorted to the ground by police. A similar arrangement remained in place for every subsequent fixture between the two clubs at Kingsmeadow.\nOn 20 December 2017, AFC Wimbledon were charged by the EFL with an alleged breach of league regulations following their home encounter with Milton Keynes Dons on 22 September 2017. The alleged breach related to the club not referring to Milton Keynes Dons by their full name on Kingsmeadow's electronic scoreboard throughout the tie as well as failing include their name on the cover of the matchday programme and only referring to them as MK or Milton Keynes.\nIn April 2018, the EFL reported that it was facilitating mediation between the two clubs in an attempt to reach an amicable agreement in relation to the clubs' relationship towards one another. On 10 July 2019, a further statement revealed mediation talks were still ongoing but that a temporary agreement for AFC Wimbledon to treat MK Dons' club name in an equal manner to any other visiting club, in relation to the matchday programme and scoreboard, had been reached.\nPlayers for both clubs.\nNo footballer has played for both clubs on a permanent basis. The following footballers have played for both clubs, although all have been loan signings for one or both clubs. \nAFC Wimbledon, then Milton Keynes Dons\n \nMilton Keynes Dons, then AFC Wimbledon\nFootballers who previously played for Wimbledon.\nThe following players played for the original Wimbledon club, and later played for either AFC Wimbledon or Milton Keynes Dons. The majority of players who have played for both Wimbledon FC and Milton Keynes Dons were members of the team at the time of the relocation.\nWimbledon and AFC Wimbledon\nWimbledon and Milton Keynes Dons\nStatistics.\nAll figures are correct as of 2 March 2024."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2017 season began with the wild-card round on January 6, 2018, and concluded with Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018, when the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nSeveral teams broke long playoff droughts, as the Buffalo Bills, Los Angeles Rams, Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans each qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1999, 2004, 2007 and 2008, respectively.\nThis was the first postseason since 2008–09 to not feature Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers and the first since 2001–02 without the Manning name (Peyton or Eli).\nThe playoffs were also notable for the Patriots reaching a seventh consecutive AFC Championship Game, extending their own NFL record, and the Eagles snapping a 57-year championship drought and claiming their first in the Super Bowl era.\nFor the first time since 2013–14, no games went to overtime.\nSchedule.\nSource:\nWild card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 6, 2018.\nAFC: Tennessee Titans 22, Kansas City Chiefs 21.\nThe Tennessee Titans overcame an 18-point halftime deficit to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs 22–21 and won their first playoff game since the 2003 season.\nKansas City opened the scoring on their second possession of the game. After Alex Smith connected with Tyreek Hill for 45 yards and Travis Kelce for a 27-yard completion, Kareem Hunt ran in for a one-yard touchdown. On their next drive the Chiefs drove 76 yards in five plays, with Smith completing a 26-yard pass to Hill and an 18-yard pass to receiver Albert Wilson. Following an 18-yard run by Hunt, Smith hit Kelce for a 13-yard touchdown. Smith finished the quarter with 154 passing yards, a career high.\nIn the second quarter, Tennessee advanced to Kansas City's 21-yard line before Marcus Mariota was intercepted by Marcus Peters, who returned the ball 28 yards to the Chiefs' 37-yard line. Following a punt, tight end Delanie Walker's 22-yard reception sparked a drive to the Chiefs' 22-yard line; however, on third-and-4, linebacker Derrick Johnson sacked Mariota and forced the team to settle for a 49-yard Ryan Succop field goal. The Chiefs increased their lead to 18 points by the end of the half, however, with a nine-play, 79-yard drive that culminated in a 14-yard scoring pass from Smith to Demarcus Robinson with three seconds left in the half. Kansas City went into halftime with a 21–3 lead, with more total yards (284 to 127) and more first downs (16 to 3). However, Kelce suffered a game-ending injury while catching a 12-yard pass on the final drive.\nTennessee opened the second half with a 15-play, 91-yard drive that consumed 8:29 off the clock. On a third-down play from the Kansas City 6-yard line, Mariota attempted a pass, which was deflected by Darrelle Revis, back to Mariota, who ran it in for a touchdown, making him the first quarterback to complete a touchdown pass to himself in a postseason game. The Chiefs were forced to punt on their next drive, but Adoree' Jackson muffed the catch and Keith Reaser recovered for Kansas City. They were unable to capitalize on the turnover, however, as they lost two yards over their next three plays and Harrison Butker hit the upright from a 48-yard field goal attempt. Tennessee took the ball back and drove 62 yards in six plays, scoring on a 35-yard run by Derrick Henry on the second play of the fourth quarter to cut the score to 21–16 after a failed two-point conversion.\nAgain forcing a Kansas City punt, Tennessee drove 81 yards in 11 plays to take their first lead of the game. Mariota converted three third downs on the drive, completing a 9-yard pass to Walker on third-and-3, scrambling 17 yards for a first down on third-and-8, and then connecting a 10-yard pass to tight end Jonnu Smith on third-and-2. Eventually, Mariota finished the drive by throwing to Eric Decker for a 22-yard touchdown, giving Tennessee a 22–21 lead following another failed two-point conversion with 6:06 remaining. Kansas City then drove into Tennessee territory, but Alex Smith was sacked on third down by Derrick Morgan and then missed a pass to Wilson on fourth down with 2:09 left. On the second play of Tennessee's drive, Johnson recovered a Henry fumble and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown, but Henry was ruled down by contact upon review. One play later, Kansas City had one last chance to get the ball back on a third-and-10 situation. Mariota handed the ball off to Henry, who started to run to the middle, but then switched direction and ran to the left. Aided by a key block from Mariota against linebacker Frank Zombo, Henry raced 22 yards down the left sideline for a game-clinching first down, and the Titans ran out the rest of the clock, having held the Chiefs to 41 yards and three first downs in the second half.\nAlex Smith finished as the leading passer with 264 yards and two touchdowns, but only 110 yards after the first quarter. Mariota threw for 205 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in his first playoff start; his self-caught touchdown pass made him the first player since at least 1950 to throw and catch a touchdown pass in the same playoff game. Henry gained 156 yards on 23 carries and 191 total yards from scrimmage, while Hunt, the league's leading rusher during the regular season, gained just 42 yards on 11 carries. Chiefs coach Andy Reid faced criticism for not relying on Hunt to protect their lead in the second half, as Hunt only carried the ball five times after halftime.\nTennessee became the first road team to erase an 18-point deficit to win a postseason game since the 1972 playoffs. The loss was Kansas City's sixth consecutive home playoff loss, extending a league record.\nNFC: Atlanta Falcons 26, Los Angeles Rams 13.\nIn the first playoff game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since the 1993 NFL season, and the first Rams playoff hosted at the venue since the 1978 NFL season, Matt Ryan threw for 218 yards and a touchdown, and kicker Matt Bryant kicked four field goals to beat the Rams.\nAtlanta got an early scoring opportunity when Blake Countess muffed a punt that Falcons linebacker LaRoy Reynolds recovered on the Rams' 17-yard line, leading to Matt Bryant's 29-yard field goal. Then, after a punt, Atlanta receiver Julio Jones caught a 27-yard pass and rushed for 13 yards on an end-around play as the team drove 57 yards in nine plays to go up 6–0 on Bryant's 51-yard field goal. Damontae Kazee forced a fumble from Pharoh Cooper on the ensuing kickoff, which Kemal Ishmael recovered for Atlanta on the Rams' 32-yard line. This time, the Falcons were able to take the ball to the end zone, scoring on a 3-yard touchdown run by Devonta Freeman as a result of center Alex Mack literally dragging him across the goal line.\nLate in the second quarter, the Rams finally managed to get on the board, sparked by a 26-yard run by Todd Gurley. Jared Goff finished the drive with passes to Cooper Kupp, the first for 15 yards and the second a 14-yard touchdown completion that made the score 13–7. The next time they had the ball, only 1:15 remained in the half, but they were able to convert a 38-yard completion from Goff to Robert Woods into a 35-yard Sam Ficken field goal, making the score 13–10 at halftime.\nThe Falcons took up more than half the third quarter with their opening drive, moving the ball 76 yards in 16 plays. Freeman carried the ball six times for 42 yards, while quarterback Matt Ryan converted a fourth-and-1 with a 1-yard sneak. Bryant finished the possession with his third field goal, this one from 25 yards, increasing their lead to 16–10. After a Rams punt, Ryan's completions to Jones for gains of 12 and 16 yards set up Bryant's fourth field goal, a 51-yard kick, to put the team up 19–10. The Rams quickly struck back, with Gurley rushing twice for gains of 14 and 33 yards, along with Goff completing an 18-yard pass to Woods. Ficken's 32-yard field goal at the end of the drive cut the deficit to 19–13 with just over 10 minutes left. However, Atlanta came back with an eight-play, 83-yard drive featuring a 52-yard completion from Ryan to Mohamed Sanu. On the last play, Ryan's 8-yard touchdown pass to Jones put his team up 26–13. The Rams responded with one last drive to try and get back in the game, moving the ball to a third-and-goal situation on Atlanta's 5-yard line. Goff then threw a touchdown pass to tight end Tyler Higbee, but the call was reversed by a review, as replays showed the ball hit the ground as Higbee was going to the turf. On the next play, Goff threw an incomplete pass, causing a turnover on downs with 2:05 left. The Rams received the ball one more time, but this resulted in another turnover on downs. \nRyan completed 21 of 30 passes for 213 yards and a touchdown, while Jones caught nine passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Goff finished the day 24-for-45 for 259 yards and a touchdown. His top target was Woods, who caught nine passes for 142 yards. Gurley was the game's top rusher with 101 yards on 14 carries, while also catching four passes for 10 yards.\nThis was the first Atlanta road playoff since 2002.\nSunday, January 7, 2018.\nAFC: Jacksonville Jaguars 10, Buffalo Bills 3.\nThis marked the Bills' first playoff appearance since 1999.\nIn the Jaguars' first playoff appearance since 2007 and the lowest scoring NFL postseason game since the 1997 season, Jacksonville's 15-play, 86-yard touchdown drive in the third quarter was enough to propel them to victory.\nEvery drive in the first quarter ended in a punt. Early in the second quarter, Jacksonville got a chance to score when Aaron Colvin intercepted a pass from Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor on the Buffalo 35-yard line. However, the team lost three yards over the next three plays and decided to punt rather than risk a long field goal. From there, Buffalo took up nearly all the remaining time in the quarter, driving all the way to the Jaguars' 1-yard line. However, an offensive pass interference penalty against receiver Kelvin Benjamin pushed them back 10 yards and they ended up settling for a 31-yard Steven Hauschka field goal to take a 3–0 lead with 1:49 left in the half. After an exchange of punts, Jacksonville got the ball on their own 47-yard line with 40 seconds left and quarterback Blake Bortles scrambled twice for gains of 20 and 12 yards to set up Josh Lambo's 44-yard field goal, tying the score at halftime.\nOn the Jaguars' second possession of the second half, they drove 86 yards in 15 plays to take a 10–3 lead. The key player of the drive was running back Leonard Fournette, who carried the ball eight times for 33 yards and caught a pass for 12 yards. Eventually the team faced fourth-and-goal on the 1-yard line and decided to go for the touchdown; the decision paid off as Bortles threw a pass to tight end Ben Koyack for the score with 42 seconds left in the third quarter. Jacksonville's defense then locked the Bills down in the fourth quarter, forcing three punts and an interception by Jalen Ramsey on the Jaguars' 48-yard line with 26 seconds left.\nBortles completed only 12 of 23 passes for 87 yards and a touchdown, but was also the game's leading rusher with 88 yards on the ground. Bills running back LeSean McCoy rushed for 75 yards and caught six passes for 44 yards.\nNFC: New Orleans Saints 31, Carolina Panthers 26.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Panthers and Saints.\nCarolina had a chance to score on their second possession of the game, driving to a third-and-goal on the Saints' 7-yard line. But over the next two plays, Kaelin Clay dropped a potential touchdown catch in the end zone and then Graham Gano missed a 25-yard field goal attempt. On the second play after the missed field goal, New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees threw a deep pass down the middle of the field to Ted Ginn Jr., who evaded a tackle attempt by James Bradberry and ran all the way to the end zone for an 80-yard touchdown reception. This gave New Orleans a 7–0 lead with less than two minutes left in the first quarter.\nCarolina responded on their next drive, converting a 22-yard completion from Cam Newton to Greg Olsen and a 39-yard pass interference penalty against defensive back Ken Crawley into a 27-yard Gano field goal that cut the score to 7–3. However, New Orleans responded immediately, with Brees completing passes to Michael Thomas for gains of 19, 8 and 13 yards, as well as passes to running backs Mark Ingram II and Alvin Kamara for gains of 13 and 10 yards. On the last play of the drive, Brees put the Saints up 14–3 with a 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Josh Hill. Carolina struck back, with Newton completing a 19-yard pass to Brenton Bersin and converting a fourth-and-1 with a quarterback sneak. Gano finished the 54-yard drive with a 39-yard field goal to make the score 14–6 with 2:47 left in the half. Brees responded by completing 4 of 6 passes for 67 yards on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by fullback Zach Line, increasing the Saints' lead to 21–6. Taking the ball back with just over 40 seconds left, Newton completed a 24-yard pass to Devin Funchess. A few more plays moved the ball to the Saints' 40-yard line, where Gano barely managed to squeeze a 58-yard field goal inside the left upright, tying the NFL record for the longest field goal in postseason history.\nThe Panthers continued to chip away at their deficit with their first drive of the second half, as they moved the ball 64 yards in nine plays on a possession that featured a 29-yard run by Jonathan Stewart. Gano finished the drive with his fourth field goal, making the score 21–12. But New Orleans was able to respond, with Ginn catching two passes for 30 yards on a 36-yard drive that ended with Wil Lutz kicking a 57-yard field goal, bringing their lead back up to 24–12. With less than two minutes left in the third quarter, the Panthers started a 68-yard drive in which Olsen caught three passes for 54 total yards, the last one a 14-yard touchdown catch that cut the score to 24–19.\nFollowing a few punts, Brees' 46-yard completion to Thomas gave the Saints a first down on the Carolina 5-yard line, where they went on to score with Kamara's 2-yard touchdown run and go up 31–19 with 5:08 left. On the third play of the Panthers' next drive, Newton completed a short pass to running back Christian McCaffrey, who raced 56 yards for a touchdown, cutting the score to 31–26. New Orleans took the ball back and drove to a fourth-and-2 situation on the 47-yard line at the two-minute warning. Deciding to go for the first down, Brees threw a pass that was intercepted by safety Mike Adams, giving the ball back to the Panthers, though Adams' decision to intercept the ball instead of knocking the pass down ended up costing his team 16 yards. Carolina then drove to the Saints' 21-yard line. On second down, Newton was flagged for intentional grounding while throwing a pass to avoid a sack, bringing up third-and-23. Then after an incompletion, safety Vonn Bell sacked Newton, forcing a turnover on downs with four seconds left.\nNewton finished the game 24-of-40 for 349 yards and two touchdowns, along with 37 yards on the ground. His top target was Olsen (eight receptions for 107 yards and a touchdown), who was one of four players in this game to have over 100 receiving yards. The others were McCaffrey (six for 101 yards and a touchdown), Thomas (eight receptions for 131 yards) and Ginn (four receptions for 115 yards and a touchdown). Brees was 23-of-33 for 376 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. Bell had nine tackles – seven solo – and a sack.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 13, 2018.\nNFC: Philadelphia Eagles 15, Atlanta Falcons 10.\nPhiladelphia's defense recorded three sacks, held Atlanta to 281 yards – 83 below their season average – and stopped the Falcons on four consecutive plays after a first-and-goal on their own 9-yard line in the final minutes to preserve a 15–10 win.\nThe Eagles seemed primed to score on their opening drive when a 42-yard pass interference penalty on Falcons defensive back Brian Poole gave them the ball on the Falcons' 33-yard line. But on the next play, Ricardo Allen forced a fumble from Jay Ajayi that was recovered by safety Keanu Neal. Atlanta then drove 59 yards in 12 plays to score on Matt Bryant's 33-yard field goal, giving them a 3–0 lead. After the teams exchanged punts, Ajayi rushed four times for 26 yards and receiver Nelson Agholor ran for 21 yards on an end-around play as the team drove to a fourth-and-goal on the Atlanta 1-yard line. On the next play, LeGarrette Blount finished the 86-yard drive with a rush for the touchdown, putting the team up 6–3 with 10:28 left in the half after Jake Elliott hit the upright on his extra point attempt.\nAtlanta had to punt on their next drive, but the ball bounced into Eagles blocker Bryan Braman and was recovered by Falcons linebacker LaRoy Reynolds on the Philadelphia 18-yard line, where they went on to go up 10–6 with Matt Ryan's six-yard touchdown pass to running back Devonta Freeman. Following a punt from each team, Philadelphia got the ball on their own 28-yard line with 46 seconds left in the half. Quarterback Nick Foles then completed passes to Corey Clement, Torrey Smith and Alshon Jeffery for gains of 7, 20 and 15 yards, setting up Elliott's 53-yard field goal, which cut the score to 10–9 at halftime.\nWith just under six minutes left in the third quarter, the Eagles got the ball on their own 7-yard line due to a 39-yard punt by Matt Bosher. From there, Foles completed 5 of 7 passes for 70 yards – Jeffery caught three of them for 46 – on a 74-yard, 12-play drive to take the lead at 12–10 with Elliott's 37-yard field goal. Elliott's ensuing kickoff went out of bounds, giving Atlanta good field position on their own 40-yard line. On the next play, the last of the third quarter, Ryan was sacked for a 10-yard loss by safety Rodney McLeod. The Falcons ended up going three-and-out and their defense was soon back on the field trying to contain another long Eagles drive. This one went for 14 plays and 80 yards, 32 of them on a reception by Ajayi, taking 7:57 off the clock. Desmond Trufant managed to end the drive on the Falcons' 3-yard line by tackling Clement a yard short of a first down on third-and-3. However, Elliott kicked his third field goal on the next play, giving Philadelphia a 15–10 lead with 6:02 remaining. Atlanta took the ball back and drove to a first down on the Eagles' 9-yard line, featuring a 20-yard reception by Julio Jones on fourth-and-6. After throwing incomplete passes on the next two plays, Ryan threw a seven-yard pass to Jones on the 2-yard line. Then with 1:05 left, Ryan tried to connect with Jones in the end zone, but the pass went just through his hands, enabling the Eagles to get the ball and run out the clock.\nFilling in for injured starter Carson Wentz, Foles completed 23 of 30 passes for 246 yards. Ajayi rushed for 54 yards and caught three passes for 44 yards. Ryan completed 22 of 36 passes for 210 yards and a touchdown. Jones caught nine passes for 101 yards and rushed for 21 yards, while Tevin Coleman was the top rusher of the game with 10 carries for 79 yards, while also catching a pass for 14 yards.\nWith the win, the Eagles won their first playoff game and advanced to their first NFC Championship appearance since 2008, and their first at home since 2004.\nAFC: New England Patriots 35, Tennessee Titans 14.\nNew England racked up 438 yards of offense, 31 first downs and eight sacks as they advanced to their seventh consecutive AFC Championship game.\nMidway through the first quarter, Tennessee drove 95 yards in 11 plays, featuring a 36-yard completion from Marcus Mariota to tight end Delanie Walker. Mariota finished the drive with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Corey Davis, who made a running one-handed catch in the back corner of the end zone to put the Titans up 7–0. However, the Patriots stormed right back, with Tom Brady completing five consecutive passes for 67 yards, the longest a 32-yard completion to Dion Lewis and the last a five-yard shovel pass to James White for a touchdown that tied the score. After a Tennessee punt, Brady completed three consecutive passes for 28 yards as the team drove 48 yards in six plays to go up 14–7 on White's six-yard touchdown run with 9:20 left in the half.\nThe next time New England got the ball, they had to punt after three plays, but a neutral zone infraction penalty on Titans defensive back Brynden Trawick gave them a first down. Taking advantage of their second chance, they ended up driving 91 yards in 16 plays to take a 21–7 lead on Brady's six-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan. Tennessee then drove to the Patriots' 46-yard line; on fourth-and-1, Derrick Henry tried to run for a first down, but defensive backs Malcolm Butler and Stephon Gilmore tackled him for no gain. With 17 seconds left, the Patriots were able to get to the Titans' 35-yard line with time remaining, but Stephen Gostkowski missed a 53-yard field goal attempt as time expired. In the first half alone, Brady completed 21 of 31 passes for 206 yards and two touchdowns.\nIn the third quarter, Brett Kern's 40-yard punt from his own 16-yard line gave the Patriots good field position on their 44-yard line. On the next play, Brady completed a 27-yard pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski and the team went on to increase their lead to 28–7 with Brandon Bolden's two-yard touchdown run. The next time New England got the ball, they went on a 15-play, 90-yard drive in which they only faced two third downs. Brady completed seven passes for 78 yards on the drive, the longest a 25-yard throw to Danny Amendola, and finished it off with a four-yard touchdown toss to Gronkowski, making the score 35–7 with 10:22 left. Before the end of the quarter, the Titans were able to make it 35–14 with Mariota's 11-yard touchdown pass to Davis on fourth down at the end of an 80-yard, 16-play drive.\nAt , Brady became the oldest quarterback to lead his team to victory in a postseason game, finishing the day 35-of-53 for 337 yards and three touchdowns. Amendola caught 11 passes for 112 yards, while also returning three punts for 18 yards. Lewis rushed for 62 yards, caught nine passes for 79 yards and returned a kickoff for 27 yards. Linebacker Geneo Grissom and defensive tackle Deatrich Wise Jr. each had two sacks for New England. Mariota completed 22 of 37 passes for 225 yards and two touchdowns.\nThis game set the NFL postseason record for the largest age difference between opposing quarterbacks: Brady was 40 and Mariota was 24.\nSunday, January 14, 2018.\nAFC: Jacksonville Jaguars 45, Pittsburgh Steelers 42.\nJacksonville built up a 28–7 first-half lead and held off a second-half Steelers comeback to win the fourth-highest-scoring NFL playoff game. It was a rematch of a regular season game in Week 5, which the Jags won 30–9 thanks to their defense intercepting Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger five times.\nThe Jaguars drove 66 yards in eight plays on their opening drive, with Blake Bortles completing passes to tight ends Ben Koyack and James O'Shaughnessy for gains of 21 and 19 yards on the way to a one-yard fourth-down touchdown run by Leonard Fournette. Later in the first quarter, linebacker Myles Jack intercepted a pass from Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger on the Pittsburgh 18-yard line and Fournette increased Jacksonville's lead to 14–0 with a touchdown run on the next play. The Steelers responded with a drive to the Jacksonville 21-yard line, but on fourth-and-1, running back Le'Veon Bell was tackled by Jalen Ramsey and Malik Jackson for a four-yard loss. The Jaguars then drove 75 yards in 11 plays and scored on T. J. Yeldon's 4-yard touchdown run, increasing their lead to 21–0 with just over 11 minutes left in the half.\nThis time, the Steelers responded with a 64-yard scoring drive, featuring a 21-yard run by Bell and ending on Roethlisberger's 23-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Brown. But the next time Pittsburgh got the ball, Roethlisberger lost a fumble while being sacked by Yannick Ngakoue. Linebacker Telvin Smith recovered the ball and returned it 50 yards for a touchdown, making the score 28–7 with less than two minutes left until halftime. However, the Jaguars were penalized 15 yards for excessive celebration, before Cameron Sutton returned the ensuing kickoff 22 yards to the Jacksonville 49-yard line. Pittsburgh went on to drive 51 yards and cut their deficit to 28–14 on Roethlisberger's 36-yard touchdown completion to Martavis Bryant with 25 seconds remaining.\nThe Steelers drove 77 yards in 10 plays on their opening drive of the second half, cutting their deficit to 28–21 with Roethlisberger's 19-yard touchdown pass to Bell. Early in the final period, the Steelers got the ball on the Jaguars' 48-yard line due to a deflected punt, but ended up turning the ball over with an incomplete pass on fourth-and-1. On the ensuing Jacksonville drive, Bortles' 45-yard completion to Keelan Cole put them on the Steelers' 3-yard line and Fournette ran the ball in for a touchdown on the next play, giving the Jaguars a 35–21 lead. This was the start of a scoring run from both teams, cumulatively totaling 38 points in the fourth quarter. After Fournette's score, Roethlisberger started the next drive with a 21-yard completion to Brown and eventually ended it with a 43-yard touchdown pass to Brown that cut the score to 35–28. Jacksonville stormed right back, moving the ball 75 yards in eight plays, one of them a 40-yard completion from Bortles to Yeldon on third-and-5. Fullback Tommy Bohanon caught a 14-yard touchdown pass from Bortles with 4:19 left, giving the Jaguars a 42–28 lead. The Steelers responded by moving the ball 75 yards in 12 plays, the longest a 22-yard reception from Bell. Bell finished the drive with an eight-yard touchdown run, reducing his team's deficit to 42–35 with 2:19 to play. However, Pittsburgh failed to recover their ensuing onside kick attempt, resulting in Jacksonville getting the ball back on the Steelers' 36-yard line and leading to a 45-yard Josh Lambo field goal that put the Jaguars up 45–35. Pittsburgh then drove 75 yards in 10 plays, including a 42-yard completion from Roethlisberger to Brown. He ended up throwing a four-yard touchdown pass to JuJu Smith-Schuster, but by then, one second remained.\nBortles completed 14 of 26 passes for 214 yards and a touchdown. Fournette was the top rusher of the game with 25 carries for 109 yards and three touchdowns, along with two receptions for 10 yards. Setting several franchise playoff records, Roethlisberger completed 37 of 58 passes for 469 yards – the second highest total in NFL postseason history, behind Bernie Kosar's 489-yard tally, from January 1987 – with five touchdowns and an interception. Bell rushed for 67 yards and a touchdown, while also catching nine passes for 88 yards, while Brown caught seven passes for 132 yards and two touchdowns. Tight end Vance McDonald also went over 100 yards receiving, making 10 receptions for 112 yards. The Steelers lost despite gaining 545 yards of total offense, the most yards gained by a losing team in a playoff game (this record was later surpassed by the Patriots in Super Bowl LII). Ben Roethlisberger became the first NFL quarterback in a playoff game to throw for five touchdowns in a losing effort. He was the first NFL quarterback to do this in any game since Tony Romo in 2013 against the Denver Broncos. Following the game, the Steelers were criticized by their fans and the media for looking past the Jaguars to the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, which, had the Steelers won, would have been the second consecutive AFC Championship meeting between the two teams. This was also the last game that running back Le'Veon Bell played for the Steelers, as he sat out the 2018 season due to a contract dispute, then sign with the New York Jets once he became a free agent at the start of 2019.\nNFC: Minnesota Vikings 29, New Orleans Saints 24.\nVikings quarterback Case Keenum's 61-yard touchdown pass to Stefon Diggs on the game's final play sent them to the NFC title game for the first time since the 2009 season and marked the first time in the NFL postseason that a game was won with a touchdown on the final play of regulation. The game has been referred to as the \"Minneapolis Miracle\".\nMinnesota dominated the first half, building up a 17–0 lead. The Saints had to punt on their opening drive and Marcus Sherels returned the ball 19 yards to the Vikings' 45-yard line before being tackled by punter Thomas Morstead. The Vikings then drove 55 yards in eight plays, including a 22-yard catch by Jarius Wright on third-and-3, to score on Jerick McKinnon's 14-yard touchdown run. The next time they got the ball, two pass interference penalties on defensive back Ken Crawley gave the Vikings 54 yards on a 79-yard drive that ended with Kai Forbath's 20-yard field goal, increasing their lead to 10–0. Following two more possessions, Vikings safety Andrew Sendejo intercepted a pass from Drew Brees, giving Minnesota the ball on their own 42-yard line with 1:06 left in the first quarter. Keenum went 5-of-7 for 54 yards on a 58-yard drive that ended with Latavius Murray's one-yard touchdown run, giving the Vikings a 17–0 lead.\nNew Orleans responded with a drive to the Vikings' 14-yard line, but lost their chance to score when Brees threw a pass that was tipped at the line by Everson Griffen and intercepted by linebacker Anthony Barr. Then after a punt, Brees led the team to the Minnesota 30-yard line. But after two incompletions, Brees was sacked by safety Harrison Smith for a 10-yard loss and Wil Lutz missed a 58-yard field goal attempt with 26 seconds left in the half. The Vikings also got a field goal try before halftime, which resulted in Forbath missing from 49 yards out.\nMinnesota took the opening kickoff and drove to the Saints' 30-yard line. However, in what turned out to be a crucial turning point, Keenum was sacked by Sheldon Rankins for a 10-yard loss on third down, pushing the team out of field goal range. New Orleans took the ball back and drove 80 yards in 12 plays, featuring a 23-yard reception by receiver Michael Thomas. Brees finished the drive with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Thomas, putting New Orleans on the board at 17–7. Then on the first play after the kickoff, Keenum threw a pass that was intercepted by rookie safety Marcus Williams, who returned it 12 yards to the Vikings' 30-yard line. New Orleans then drove for another touchdown, scoring on Brees' three-yard pass to Thomas that narrowed the gap to 17–14 with 13:09 left in the game.\nMinnesota responded with a seven-play, 44-yard drive that included a 27-yard completion from Keenum to Wright and ended on Forbath's 49-yard field goal that increased the Vikings' lead to 20–14. Furthermore, Saints coach Sean Payton lost two timeouts on the drive as a result of failed replay challenges. After forcing the Saints to punt, the Vikings ran the clock under six minutes before having to kick the ball back to New Orleans. Saints lineman George Johnson blocked the punt, enabling his team to take over on the Vikings' 40-yard line. From there, Brees completed four consecutive passes, the last one a 14-yard touchdown completion to running back Alvin Kamara, giving them their first lead of the game at 21–20 with 3:01 left. Undaunted, the Vikings stormed back, mainly on the strength of a 24-yard Adam Thielen reception, moving the ball to the Saints 35-yard line, where Forbath made a 53-yard field goal that gave the team a 23–21 lead with 1:29 remaining. Brees was able to answer, throwing an 18-yard pass to tight end Josh Hill, an 11-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. and a 13-yard completion to Willie Snead on fourth-and-10. Minnesota eventually halted the drive on their own 25-yard line, where Lutz kicked a 43-yard field goal.\nThe Vikings were now down 24–23 with 25 seconds and one timeout left. After a touchback and a false start penalty put the ball on the 20-yard line, Keenum completed a 19-yard pass to Diggs on the 39-yard line, where the team promptly called their last timeout. Following two incomplete passes, they faced third-and-10 with 10 seconds left. On the next play, Keenum threw a deep pass near the right sideline to Diggs, who made a leaping catch near the Saints' 35-yard line. Williams was in front of Diggs when he made the catch, but while trying to make a tackle, he completely missed Diggs and instead collided with Crawley (his own teammate and the other defender in range), leaving the receiver with no one around him. Diggs nearly fell over at this point, but was able to stay on his feet by using his off-hand and stay in bounds as he ran all the way to the end zone for a 61-yard touchdown completion to give the Vikings a 29–24 win. After several minutes of pandemonium, the Vikings knelt on the extra point try to close out the victory.\nKeenum completed 25 of 40 passes for 318 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Diggs was the game's leading receiver with six receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown. Like Keenum, Brees also finished the game 25-of-40, but for 294 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. Kamara rushed for 43 yards, while also catching six passes for 72 yards and a touchdown.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 21, 2018.\nAFC: New England Patriots 24, Jacksonville Jaguars 20.\nThis was the first conference championship game to feature a team from Florida in 15 years (the Super Bowl XXXVII champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the 2002 NFC championship Game). New England overcame a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to earn the franchise's 10th Super Bowl appearance.\nOn the opening drive of the game, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady completed a 31-yard pass to Brandin Cooks and a 20-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Amendola on fourth-and-1 as the team drove 62 yards in 10 plays to score on Stephen Gostkowski's 31-yard field goal. Following a pair of punts, Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles completed two passes to running back Corey Grant for 44 total yards as the team drove 76 yards in seven plays to take a 7–3 lead on a four-yard touchdown pass to tight end Marcedes Lewis on the second play of the second quarter. The next time they got the ball, Bortles completed all four pass attempts for 47 yards, one of them a 27-yard completion to Allen Hurns, as the team drove 77 yards in 10 plays to score on Leonard Fournette's four-yard touchdown run, increasing their lead to 14–3.\nOn the Jaguars' next drive, they moved the ball to a third-and-7 on the Patriots' 47-yard line. Bortles completed a 12-yard pass to Lewis that would have picked up a first down, but the team was flagged for a delay of game and Bortles was sacked by Adam Butler on the next play. New England got the ball on their own 15-yard line with 2:02 left in the half and proceeded to drive 85 yards in six plays – 47 yards from Jaguars penalties – to score on James White's 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 14–10. However, Jacksonville safety Barry Church delivered a helmet-to-helmet hit on Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski. Church drew a 15-yard penalty and Gronkowski was escorted off for medical testing that determined that he had suffered a concussion. Jacksonville got the ball back with 55 seconds and all three timeouts remaining, but chose to run out the clock and go to halftime, a choice that later earned them criticism, as no team had deliberately run the first half clock out with more than 50 seconds left during the season.\nJacksonville received the second half kickoff and drove 39 yards in nine plays, with 20 yards from a reception by fullback Tommy Bohanon. Josh Lambo finished the drive with a 54-yard field goal, increasing his team's lead to 17–10. Later in the period, the Jaguars advanced 66 yards in 11 plays, including 18 yards on a completion from Bortles to Marqise Lee on third-and-3. On the second play of the fourth quarter, Lambo scored with a 43-yard field goal, making the score 20–10. The game seemed to be slipping away from New England, particularly on their ensuing drive when linebacker Myles Jack forced and recovered a fumble from Dion Lewis on a trick play in which Amendola completed a forward pass to Lewis on the Jacksonville 33-yard line and Jack was ruled down by contact, nullifying what would have been a Jaguars touchdown. The New England defense subsequently forced a three-and-out. Taking the ball back on the Patriots' 15-yard line, Brady started the drive with an 18-yard pass to Cooks and then converted a third-and-18 with a 21-yard completion to Amendola on the 46-yard line. From there, Brady completed passes to Phillip Dorsett for 31 yards and Amendola for 14 yards before finishing the drive with a nine-yard touchdown pass to Amendola, making the score 20–17.\nFollowing a pair of punts, Ryan Allen's 35-yard kick pinned the Jaguars back at their own 10-yard line. The Jaguars lost one yard over their next three plays, before Amendola returned Brad Nortman's 41-yard punt 20 yards to the Jacksonville 30-yard line with 4:58 left. From there, New England drove 30 yards in five plays, scoring on Brady's four-yard touchdown pass to Amendola to take a 24–20 lead with 2:48 left. After taking the ball back, Bortles' 29-yard completion to Dede Westbrook gave the Jaguars a first down on the Patriots' 38-yard line. But over the next two plays, Bortles threw an incompletion and then fumbled the ball while being sacked by linebacker Kyle Van Noy. Jacksonville tackle Cam Robinson recovered the fumble, but the team lost nine yards on the play, bringing up third-and-19. After a four-yard pass to James O'Shaughnessy, Bortles' next pass was swatted away by Stephon Gilmore, causing a turnover on downs with 1:47 left. New England got a key first down on third-and-10 with an 18-yard run by Lewis that let them run out the clock.\nBrady completed 26 of 38 passes for 290 yards and two touchdowns, Cooks was the top receiver of the game with six receptions for 100 yards, while Amendola caught seven passes for 84 yards and two touchdowns; he also returned two punts for 24 yards. Van Noy had nine tackles – including five solo tackles – a sack and a forced fumble. Bortles completed 23 of 36 passes for 293 yards and a touchdown, while Fournette was the leading rusher of the game with 76 yards and a touchdown and Hurns was the Jaguars' leading receiver with six receptions for 80 yards.\nNFC: Philadelphia Eagles 38, Minnesota Vikings 7.\nThis was the first time a Super Bowl host team had appeared in the conference championship. Although the Vikings scored with their opening drive, they were soon buried by Philadelphia, who racked up 456 total yards and 38 unanswered points. Meanwhile, the Vikings' eight remaining drives after their game-opening touchdown resulted in three punts, two interceptions, two turnovers on downs and one lost fumble.\nMinnesota drove 75 yards in nine plays on their first possession, taking a 7–0 lead with Case Keenum's 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph. The Eagles had to punt on their next drive, but after moving the ball to the 43-yard line, Keenum threw a pass that was intercepted by cornerback Patrick Robinson and returned 50 yards for a touchdown. Following a Vikings punt, Philadelphia drove 75 yards in 12 plays to take a 14–7 lead. Jay Ajayi started the drive with two carries for 20 yards, while Nick Foles converted a third-and-10 with an 11-yard completion to Zach Ertz and LeGarrette Blount finished the drive with an 11-yard rushing score on the third play of the second quarter. Later on, the Vikings drove to a third-and-5 on the Eagles' 16-yard line. But on the next play, Derek Barnett forced a fumble while sacking Keenum and defensive end Chris Long recovered the ball. Philadelphia then drove 76 yards in six plays, scoring on Foles' 53-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery to go up 21–7 with 3:16 left in the half. Following a punt, the Eagles got the ball on their 20-yard line with 29 seconds on the clock. Foles started the drive with an 11-yard pass to Ajayi, who managed to get out of bounds, before throwing a 36-yard completion on Ertz on the Vikings' 33-yard line. On the next play, Foles' 13-yard completion to Ajayi moved the ball to the 20 yard line with four seconds left, where Jake Elliott kicked a 38-yard field goal, making the score 24–7 at halftime.\nThe Eagles increased their lead to 31–7 less than five minutes into the second half, scoring with Foles' 41-yard touchdown pass to Torrey Smith on a flea-flicker play. The Vikings responded with a drive to a first-and-goal on the Eagles' seven-yard line. After three incomplete passes, Keenum threw a pass to Adam Thielen that was initially ruled a touchdown, but overturned to an incomplete pass after replays showed the ball had hit the ground, causing a turnover on downs. The Eagles took over and drove 92 yards in 12 plays, including a 42-yard completion from Foles to Nelson Agholor on third-and-5. Foles finished the drive with a five-yard touchdown pass to Jeffery on the second play of the fourth quarter, making the score 38–7. The Vikings had only two drives on the final period, one of them ending with a turnover on downs and another with an interception by Eagles defensive back Corey Graham.\nFoles completed 26 of 33 passes for 352 yards and three touchdowns, Ertz was the leading receiver of the game with eight receptions for 93 yards, while Jeffery caught five passes for 85 yards and two touchdowns. Ajayi rushed for 73 yards and caught three passes for 26 yards. Keenum finished the game 28-of-48 for 271 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions, while Jerick McKinnon was the Vikings' leading rusher with 40 yards and their leading receiver with 11 receptions for 86 yards.\nThis was the final game of referee Ed Hochuli's 28-year career.\nIn the days leading up to the game, Vikings fans were seen performing the \"Skol!\" chant around various Philadelphia landmarks, such as the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where they also defaced the statue of Rocky with Vikings colors.\nTelevision coverage.\nAll playoff games were broadcast nationally on network television.\nABC and ESPN simulcast one AFC wild card game, while CBS broadcast all the other AFC playoff games. Coverage of the NFC Wild Card and Divisional rounds was split between Fox and NBC, with each network having coverage of one game in each of those two rounds. CBS had exclusive coverage of the AFC Championship Game. Fox had exclusive coverage of the NFC Championship Game. NBC had exclusive coverage of Super Bowl LII."

The next season, he achieved a second promotion with Ealing as they finished runners up in the league but were victorious in their promotion playoff game, defeating South West 1 runners up Cleve 48–16, with Ben kicking 18 points.\nRise through the National Leagues.\nWith promotion, Ealing started the 2007–08 season in National Division 3 South (the fourth tier of English rugby) and more than held their own in their first year in the national leagues, finishing 3rd in the division and just missing out on the promotion playoffs, 4 points off Cinderford (who would win their playoff game). Ben adapted well to the new league with 212 points in 22 games, finishing 3rd top scorer in the division. The next couple of seasons would see Ealing once again compete for promotion with successive 3rd-place finishes, which included several hotly contested battles with London rivals, Rosslyn Park, who twice pipped them to the playoffs, most notably during the 2009–10 season, where both sides ended tied on 113 points but Park went into the playoffs by virtue of winning one more game. Ben would feature and score regularly for Ealing in this time, coming 2nd and 3rd in the top scorer charts, including a career best (in the national leagues) 245 points in 2009–10.\nAfter missing out on promotion over the past three seasons, Ealing finally went up during the 2010–11 season, coming out on top during an epic battle with eventual runners up (and fellow promoted side), Jersey. Although relegated to secondary kicker behind team-mate, Neil Hallett, Ben featured in almost every league game as his side claimed promotion. Now in National League 1, Ealing resumed battle with promotion rivals, Jersey for the 2011–12 season. With only one place up for promotion, the league standings would be reversed as they finished runners up to Jersey who went up instead. Ben resumed kicking details this season with 177 points from the 24 games he played, breaking into the division's top 10 scorers. The 2012–13 season would see Ealing wipe out the disappointment of the previous year by emphatically winning the title and promotion to the RFU Championship for the first time in the club's history, with Ben making featuring in all but 5 games.\nChampionship Stability / Director of Rugby.\nWhile the club's first year in the RFU Championship would end in disappointment as Ealing were relegated just 1 point adrift of old foes Jersey, they proved to be competitive in the division, with Ben featuring regularly and scoring 100 points. In June 2014, Ben who was at this point a player-coach at the club, was made Director of Rugby at Ealing replacing the outgoing coach Mike Cudmore. In his first season in charge, Ben led Ealing back into the Championship, winning the league by achieving a record breaking 136 points, including 28 bonus points, on their way to the National League 1 title. Although head coach, Ben also played a key role in the team, appearing 27 games and scoring 122 points. The 2015–16 season saw Ben lead his club to survive in the Championship, finishing 11th, way ahead of the relegated side Moseley.\nHonours and records.\nEaling Trailfinders\nInternational/Representative"

Yamaha's defending champion Heikki Mikkola struggled to recover from a broken leg suffered in preseason. Noyce's consistent results earned him the championship points lead at the midpoint of the season with Suzuki's Gerrit Wolsink, Mikkola and Kawasaki's Brad Lackey within reach of the points lead. Wolsink won his fifth 500cc United States Grand Prix in six years and followed that with another victory at the Canadian Grand Prix to narrow the points lead. Mikkola then suffered another injury at the Canadian Grand Prix and his injuries forced him to sit out the West German Grand Prix. Former Honda factory rider, Lackey, won 6 individual moto victories, more than any other rider in the championship yet, his factory sponsored Kawasaki proved to be unreliable as the team struggled through development issues on a new motorcycle. Noyce then took command of the championship by posting a series of top five finishes to win the title for the Honda team.\nHåkan Carlqvist won the 250cc world championship for Husqvarna while Harry Everts dominated the 125cc world championship for the Suzuki factory racing team."

Tillinghast in 1922. Tom Bendelow designed the predecessor 9 hole course in 1896. In 1999, Ron Prichard completed a full restoration .\nSuburban Golf Club, Inc. is a non-profit corporation of approximately 230 golf members. It has an 18-hole golf course designed by the architect A. W. Tillinghast. It is situated within the township of Union, Union County, New Jersey. It lies near the intersection of the Garden State Parkway, U.S. Route 22, and New Jersey Route 82 and is approximately 15 miles from Times Square, New York City. The elevation of the Club House is 80 feet above sea level. It is adjacent to the hummocks, a natural water basin and source for the Elizabeth River. Its entrance is on Morris Avenue, which historically is the main road from Elizabeth to Morristown.\nThe club has adopted a monogram which depicts its age, having originated in 1896, and its location in the metropolitan area and particularly Northern New Jersey.\nOn March 18, 1896, a group of men, residents of Elizabeth, met, associated themselves, and formed what was then known as the Suburban Club of Elizabeth, New Jersey. The club was actually founded on March 23, 1896, when a Certificate of Incorporation of the Suburban Club of Elizabeth, New Jersey, was filed with the Union County Clerk.\nThe present course layout was designed in 1922. The course is characterized by narrow tree-lined fairways and small, well bunkered greens. Many stately indigenous trees surround the course including many types of oak, maple, elm and evergreens. Several flowering and ornamental trees are observed in the spring. The 18 holes are 6,525 yards in length, with nines of 3,362 and 3,163 yards. Par is established at 71 with nines of 36 and 35. The club has been host to many major State tournaments. The course record is 63, held by Ryan McCormick.\nIn 1999–2001, the most extensive renovation in the club's history was undertaken. Two million dollars in funds were approved by the general membership for on course renovations. Golf course architect, Ron Prichard, was commissioned to create and implement the Master Plan. Hundreds of trees were removed, 82 bunkers on the course were rebuilt, the fourteenth green was redesigned and built to USGA specifications, many fairways were reshaped/expanded, a complete new irrigation system and pumps were installed. Approximately 200 yards were added to the length of the course."

        "text": "The 2002–03 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team represented the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during the 2002–03 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Their head coach was Matt Doherty. The team captains for this season were Jonathan Holmes and Will Johnson. The team played its home games in the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nSchedule and results.\nThe Tar Heels' preseason began with their annual Blue-White Scrimmage. The attendance at the scrimmage was 14,125 people, the most people at one of the Blue-White Scrimmages at that time.\nIn between their run in the Preseason NIT, the Tar Heels played, and won, in the first game held in Old Dominion University's Ted Constant Convocation Center.\nThe Tar Heels would go on to win that season's Preseason NIT, defeating Kansas, then ranked number two in the AP Poll, and Stanford in the process. By the time the Tar Heels won over Stanford, they had their best start to a season since the 1998-99 season, when the Tar Heels started out with an 8-0 record.\nThe Tar Heels didn't fare as well in the ECAC Holiday Festival, getting upset by Iona in the first game. Iona's win against the Tar Heels was the first time Iona won over a ranked team in 23 years. The Tar Heels recovered in the second game, winning against St. John's. After the ECAC Holiday Festival, the Tar Heels would not appear in any other AP Polls that season.\nIn addition to the first game held at the Constant Center, the Tar Heels played the first game at what was then known as the University of Miami's Convocation Center. That game ended in an overtime loss for the Tar Heels.\nSeveral records involving three-point attempts were set this season. Thirty-five three-point attempts were made in the game against Davidson, setting a program record of three-point attempts made in a single game. The Tar Heels would come close to matching that record later that season against Wake Forest in the Dean Smith Center and Clemson at Littlejohn Coliseum. Eight hundred and twenty two three-point goals were attempted and 290 three-point goals were attempted this season, both program-high records.\nThe 40-point margin in the away game at Maryland became the third largest margin of defeat in the program's history, after a 43-point loss against Lynchburg Elks in 1915 and a 42-point loss against Kentucky in 1950.\nDespite a winning record at the start of this season, the Tar Heels finished conference play with a 6–10 record. The Tar Heels needed a win in the 2003 ACC men's basketball tournament to advance to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The Tar Heels fell short of this goal, defeating Maryland in the quarterfinals but falling to Duke in the semifinals.\nThe Tar Heels' then 17–15 record was good enough for the 2003 National Invitation Tournament. After defeating DePaul and Wyoming, the Tar Heels would fall to Georgetown in the quarterfinals with a 19–16 record.\nThe 16 losses in this season were the second most losses in the program's history at the time. The record would be broken by the 2009-10 season with 17 losses. The losses occurring in the 2009-10 season and this season are second and third, respectfully, to the program's loss record set in the previous season.\nDays after the end of the Tar Heels' NIT campaign, Doherty resigned as head coach on April 1, 2003. On April 14, 2003, Roy Williams would become the next head coach of the Tar Heels men's basketball team.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| NIT"

Argentina faced England, Ireland and Italy - with the latter two countries also hosting South Africa. The Springboks also faced their June test series opposition, France, whom they had beaten 3–0, before ending their tour in Wales, after the international window. Having beaten New Zealand in the third Bledisloe Cup Test match in October, Australia travelled to play Wales, England and Scotland, the latter of whom had beaten the Wallabies in Sydney during the June internationals.\nFour Tier 2 nations faced Tier 1 opposition during the international window. Ireland and Italy hosted Fiji, the first time since 2009 for Ireland. England and Scotland played host to Samoa. France and Wales hosted historic matches against Tier 2 opposition, with Wales playing Georgia for the first time and France hosting Japan for the first time in the professional era; Japan's previous visit to France came in 1973. For Japan this was the third time in five years that they had played two Tier 1 opponents during the November tests, having already hosted Australia prior to their away match against France.\nTier 2 and Tier 3.\nAfter defeating Canada and the United States away earlier in the year, Georgia played host to the same opposition at home. Romania took on Pacific opposition, hosting Samoa, and playing Samoa, for the first time since 1989, before playing host to Tonga after losing for the first time against them in 2015. For the second year in a row, Spain faced Tier 2 opposition from outside of Europe, facing Canada in what was the first meeting since they first played in 2010. As in previous November internationals, travelling Tier 2 nations faced each other at neutral venues in Europe. This year saw Japan face Tonga in Toulouse, while Fiji faced Canada in Narbonne. With Uruguay's 2019 Rugby World Cup qualifier play-offs taking place in February 2018, they embarked on a two-test series against Namibia as preparation. This was the first time since 2000 that the two nations has met, and the first time Namibia hosted the Los Teros.\nHaving won their two-test series against Brazil in November 2015 and November 2016, Germany faced Brazil for the third year in a row, this time in a one-off test match. Germany later went on to face Chile and the United States, in what were historic first ever matches between the respective nations. Brazil also faced historic opposition, playing Belgium and Spain for the first time.\nFixtures.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes"

        "text": "The Bangladesh national cricket team toured Sri Lanka from March 2017 to April 2017. The tour consisted of a series of two Test matches, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and two Twenty20 internationals (T20Is). The second Test match of the tour was the 100th Test played by Bangladesh. The tour also featured a two-day warm-up match ahead of the Test fixtures and a one-day warm-up match ahead of the ODIs. The Test series was played for the Joy Bangla Cup in honour of the father of the Bangladesh nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\nBefore the series, Sri Lanka's captain Angelo Mathews was ruled out of the Test matches with a hamstring injury. Rangana Herath was named as captain in his place. Mathews failed to recover in time for the ODI and T20I series, with Upul Tharanga named captain of the team for both formats.\nThe Test series was drawn 1–1, with Bangladesh winning the second match by 4 wickets. It was their first win against Sri Lanka in a Test match. The victory was their ninth win in Tests and their fourth overseas. The ODI series was drawn 1–1, with the second of the third match ending in a no result, due to rain. The T20I series also finished 1–1.\nAfter the conclusion of the ODI series, Bangladesh's captain, Mashrafe Mortaza, was suspended for one match for maintaining a slow over-rate in the third game. Therefore, he did not play in Bangladesh's first fixture of the 2017 Ireland Tri-Nation Series in May 2017. During the coin toss of the first T20I, Mashrafe announced his retirement from T20Is following the conclusion of the series.\nSquads.\nBangladesh's captain Mushfiqur Rahim was asked to play as a batsman only, with Litton Das becoming the wicket-keeper for the Test series. However, Das suffered a fractured rib during training ahead of the second Test, with Mushfiqur Rahim returning as the wicket-keeper for the final Test. Kusal Perera was ruled out of Sri Lanka's squad for the first two ODI matches, but he was expected to be fit for the third and final match. Mehedi Hasan was added to Bangladesh's ODI squad before the start of the limited-overs series. Niroshan Dickwella suffered a fracture to his hand in the first ODI and was ruled out of the rest of the series. Dilruwan Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara and Nuwan Pradeep were all added to Sri Lanka's ODI squad. Kusal Perera was included in Sri Lanka's T20I squad, subject to fitness, with Sandun Weerakkody added as cover, if needed."

One of his more important achievements was to reach the mixed doubles final of the 1951 Australian Championship.\nHe was trained and practiced as a dental technician, and May became an employee of Spalding Australia (A.G Spalding). He grew Spalding from a small supplier to its becoming a big manufacturer, especially in golf ball production.\nIn 1965, he and his family moved from Sydney to Melbourne (Spalding Head Office) where he remained for the rest of his life. He purchased the Sherrin Football Company in 1972, which manufactured AFL footballs in agreement with Tom Sherrin (Sherrin’s owner).\nMay improved Spalding’s overall performance and market share in the large golfing market. Hot Dot and Top Flite golf balls became big sellers and took Spalding’s market share from under 20% to almost 70%. Spalding asked Jack to move to Canada with the intention of moving him to the U.S., but Jack’s family decided to remain in Australia, so he turned down the offer.\nIn his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer recalled that he saw May play in Australia. Unaware of who he was but impressed with his skills, he asked who was on the court. Kramer was told he is \"just a weekend player\", and Kramer said \"he must be the best weekend player in the world\".\nPrivate life.\nJack was married to Patricia May (Everitt) on 3 August 1957. They had four children: Michelle, Jon, Martin and Rod."

This was the 23rd season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held and is the 76th year overall where an NCAA school fielded a team.\nIn 1969 the NCAA changed their bylaws to permit freshman to play on the Varsity team. Beginning with this season universities were permitted to not only have first-year students play for their teams but to also have said players earn letters for four seasons rather than the previous limit of three. As a consequence the WCHA offered both a Sophomore-of-the-Year and Freshman-of-the-Year awards with the previous being formally retired following the campaign.\nCornell finished the 1969–70 season with an undefeated record of 29–0, only the second flawless campaign in the modern history of Division I ice hockey. The previous unblemished season (Clarkson in 1955–56), however, came with a caveat as 8 Golden Knight players were 4-year seniors (a violation of NCAA regulations at the time). As a result, the Clarkson team declined to play in the NCAA tournament. Cornell's undefeated team had no such issues and was able to compete in, and win, both their conference tournament and the NCAA tournament to become the first and thus far only undefeated NCAA champion (as of 2022).\nSeason Outlook.\nPre-season conference polls.\nConference pre-season polls as voted on by coaches.

        "text": "Gerry Armstrong (born 1955) is an English tennis official. In a career lasting half a century, he has been a key figure at both the All-England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), where he has been the Championships Referee, and on the ATP Tour, where he is a Tour Supervisor.\nEarly life.\nGerald Armstrong was born in April 1955. His father, George Armstrong, who died in 1997, was himself a tennis official: in 1975 he was the chair-umpire for the memorable Gentlemen's Singles Final, between Arthur Ashe and Jimmy Connors.\nArmstrong qualified as a teacher in physical education (PE) at the Nonington College of Physical Education (NCPE) in Kent, from 1977 to 1980. He then graduated from Brighton University in 1983, with a BEd., specialising in sports coaching.\nCareer.\nWimbledon.\nArmstrong's career as a tennis official began in 1973, at the age of eighteen, when he became a line-judge at Wimbledon.\nIn 1982, Armstrong became a full-time chair-umpire at Wimbledon. He had first taken the chair some years earlier, in 1974, for a mixed doubles match involving major champions Evonne Goolagong and Virginia Wade and their match-partners Kim Warwick and Roger Becker. At his retirement from the chair, in 2015, he had been the umpire for thirteen finals matches: four Gentlemen's Singles, four Ladies' Singles and five Doubles matches.\nIn 2007 he became an Assistant Referee at the Championships, adding Qualification Referee in 2012 and Wheelchair Match Referee in 2014.\nIn 2020 he became the Championships Referee. He stood down in 2023.\nAustralian Open.\nIn addition to officiating at Wimbledon, Armstrong's career took him overseas, including the other Majors. This included John McEnroe's notorious 4th Round match at the 1990 AO, in Melbourne, in which the player was defaulted (disqualified) by Armstrong, game, set and match, following several code violations.\nATP World Tour.\nIn January 1990, Armstrong became one of eight full-time officials recruited for the Association of Tennis Professionals top-tier tour. He has now served more than three decades as Tour Supervisor for the ATP World Tour, now known simply as the ATP Tour.\nFamily life.\nArmstrong is married to Julie, herself a PE teacher, and they have two children; the couple are now grandparents. They live in Friston, near Eastbourne. \nArmstrong's other interests include playing village-cricket; he will turn out for Willingdon as the season allows.\nArmstrong studied at Brighton in order to obtain a BEd. degree in addition to his NCPE teaching qualification, but the University of London, which supervised many of the certificates and diplomas at the time, later decided to award retrospective honorary degrees to those who had completed the three-year course at NCPE and other colleges. As a result, Armstrong appears to have two first-degrees, both of which are a BEd."

        "text": "Tanker surfing uses water-displacement caused by large cargo and tanker ships passing through a ship channel, which in turn causes waves to form and break on shoals and sandbars along the ship channel. The waves that are generated by the ships are used by surfers to ride for kilometers if the conditions are perfect. This type of surfing has been around since the 1960s, and only a select few surfers even tried or knew of tanker surfing. One of the pioneers of modern tanker surfing is Captain James Fulbright. Captain Fulbright has been studying tanker surfing for the past 13 years and has come up with some of the most accurate formulas for tanker surfing. Some of the most important parts of tanker surfing is understanding the seabed and the way the waves react to it. The tonnage of the ships needs to be around or more than 100,000 ton, speed of at least and the draft (hull) all cumulate into a perfect setup for surfable waves to form. The problem with tanker surfing is not knowing if a ship is going to produce a wave that is suitable for surfing. This will lead to a waiting game for all the right factors to play out."

He was part of the South team that beat North 10 points to 9 on 11 November 1950.\nWhilst with Watsonians he played for Edinburgh District. He played in the 1952–53 season's Inter-City match but lost to Glasgow District.\nHe played in the Scottish Inter-District Championship in its first season. In that 1953–54 season, Edinburgh District won the first championship.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped for ten times from 1950 to 1953, playing in nine Five Nations matches. He was capped at Centre and Wing.\nHe never scored an international try, though during the Five Nations match against England in 1950, both he and teammate Donald Sloan pounced on a high kick over the try line. As both got up, Scott patted Sloan on the back and the try was awarded to Sloan.\nScott also played in Scotland's 44–0 defeat to South Africa in 1951. He remembered: \"When I played in any match there were three things I thought the man opposite me might do:- they would run at me and try to beat me; they would run at me and pass the ball; or they would kick the ball. Well, the South Africans did all that, but they also did something I had never seen before: they ran into you. They looked at you and said: come and take me. You watch rugby now and it is all about contact, and laying the ball off in different ways. That was the first time I saw that approach.\"\nOutside of rugby.\nScott was a teacher at George Watson's College. He coached the school's 1st XV at rugby union."

Instead of home field advantage being awarded to the team from the league that won the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, home field advantage in the World Series was determined by the team with the better regular season record.\nThe following teams qualified for the postseason:\nPlayoff bracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nAmerican League Wild Card.\n(4) New York Yankees vs. (5) Minnesota Twins.\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Yankees and Twins, with the Yankees winning the previous four meetings. The Yankees won 8–4 and advanced to the ALDS.\nNational League Wild Card.\n(4) Arizona Diamondbacks vs. (5) Colorado Rockies.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Rockies and D-Backs. They previously met in the 2007 NLCS, which the Rockies won in a sweep en route to the World Series. Despite a late rally by the Rockies, the D-Backs held on to win 11–8, and advanced to the NLDS.\nAmerican League Division Series.\n(1) Cleveland Indians vs. (4) New York Yankees.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Indians and Yankees, with Cleveland winning two of the three previous series including both times in the ALDS (1997 and 2007). The Yankees won the 1998 ALCS. The Indians won the first two games to go up 2–0, but the Yankees rallied to come back and win the series in five games, advancing to the ALCS for the first time since 2012.\n(2) Houston Astros vs. (3) Boston Red Sox.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Astros and Red Sox. The Astros won the series in four games to advance to their first ALCS. This was the first playoff series win by the Astros since the 2005 NLCS, when the team was still in the National League.\nNational League Division Series.\n(1) Los Angeles Dodgers vs. (4) Arizona Diamondbacks.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Dodgers and Diamondbacks. The Dodgers swept the Diamondbacks to advance to the NLCS for the second year in a row. \nThe Diamondbacks would not return to the postseason until 2023. They would again meet the Dodgers in the NLDS, and the Diamondbacks would win in a sweep.\n(2) Washington Nationals vs. (3) Chicago Cubs.\nThe Cubs narrowly defeated the Nationals in five games to return to the NLCS for the third year in a row. As of 2023, this is the last playoff series win by the Cubs.\nAmerican League Championship Series.\n(2) Houston Astros vs. (4) New York Yankees.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Yankees and Astros. In an ALCS where neither team won a road game, the Astros defeated the Yankees to advance to the World Series for the first time since 2005.\nThe Astros held off a late rally by the Yankees to win Game 1. In Game 2, Justin Verlander pitched a complete game as the Astros won by a 2–1 score again to go up 2–0 in the series. In the Bronx, the Yankees blew out the Astros in Game 3 to get on the board in the series. In Game 4, the Astros held a 4–0 lead after the top of the seventh, but the Yankees scored six unanswered runs to win and even the series. Masahiro Tanaka pitched seven shutout innings in Game 5 as the Yankees won 5–0 to go up 3–2 in the series headed back to Houston. In Game 6, Verlander again had another solid pitching performance as he threw seven shutout innings in a blowout win for the Astros. Charlie Morton and Lance McCullers Jr. helped shut out the Yankees in Game 7, 4–0, to clinch the pennant for the Astros.\nBoth teams would meet again in the 2019 ALCS, which the Astros won in six games, and in the 2022 ALCS, in which the Yankees were swept.\nNational League Championship Series.\n(1) Los Angeles Dodgers vs. (3) Chicago Cubs.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Dodgers and Cubs, and a rematch of the previous year's NLCS. The Dodgers defeated the defending World Series champion Cubs in five games to return to the World Series for the first time since 1988.\nIn Game 1, the Dodgers scored five unanswered runs across the fifth, sixth and seventh innings as they overcame an early 2–0 Cubs lead to win. In Game 2, the Dodgers prevailed off a walk-off three-run home run from Justin Turner in the bottom of the ninth. Turner's three-run home run was the Dodgers' first walk-off homer in the postseason since Kirk Gibson's two-run home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. When the series shifted to Chicago, Yu Darvish struck out seven in 6 innings of Game 3 as the Dodgers won 6–1 to go up 3–0 in the series. The Cubs would deny the Dodgers a sweep with a narrow victory in Game 4, however the defending champions were ultimately eliminated in a blowout loss in Game 5, 11–1. This was the third straight season in which the National League pennant was won at Wrigley Field.\nAs of 2022, this is the last time the Cubs appeared in the NLCS. The Dodgers would win the NL pennant again in two of the next three postseasons — the next year they defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games to capture the pennant, and in 2020 they defeated the Atlanta Braves, also in seven games.\n2017 World Series.\n(AL2) Houston Astros vs. (NL1) Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Dodgers and Astros. They had previously met in the 1981 NLDS, which the Dodgers won in five games en route to a World Series title. The Astros defeated the Dodgers in seven games to capture their first World Series title in franchise history, becoming the first team from Texas to accomplish such as feat. The Astros became the first team from Houston to win a championship since 1995, when the Houston Rockets repeated as NBA champions. \nThe Dodgers convincingly took Game 1 in the shortest World Series game since 1992 at 2 hours and 28 minutes. Game 2 was an 11-inning slugfest which the Astros won 7–6, as both teams had four different players hit home runs. Game 2 was the first World Series game won by the Astros in franchise history. When the series moved to Houston, the Astros took a 2–1 series lead with a two-run victory in Game 3. Game 3 was marred by controversy, as Houston's Yuli Gurriel made a racially insensitive gesture in the dugout at Los Angeles' Yu Darvish after his home run. He stretched the sides of his eyes and mouthing the Spanish word \"chinito\", which translates to \"little Chinese Boy\"; Darvish is from Japan. Gurriel apologized, and said that anyone from Asia is called a \"chino\" in Cuba, although he acknowledged knowing that the term was offensive in Japan from having played there. As a result, Rob Manfred, the Commissioner of Baseball, suspended Gurriel for the first five games of the 2018 Major League Baseball season without pay, but allowed him to continue playing in the World Series. The Dodgers rallied late in Game 4 by scoring six runs in two of the final three innings to even the series at two.\nThe series was notable for its Game 5, which saw a record six game-tying home runs and 25 combined runs scored. The six game-tying home runs in the series to this point is the most for any World Series on record. This World Series set a new record for most players to hit a home run (14 to date in the World Series). With the teams combining to score 25 runs throughout the game, this was the highest scoring World Series game since the Florida Marlins defeated the Cleveland Indians 14–11 in Game 3 of the 1997 World Series.\nWhen the series shifted back to Los Angeles, Tony Watson defeated Justin Verlander in a pitchers' duel as the Dodgers won 3–1 to force a seventh game. However, George Springer helped carry the Astros to victory in Game 7 with his fifth home run of the series. \nThe Astros' victory became controversial when MLB determined in 2019 that they had been illegally using technology to steal signs from opposing teams during their championship season, in addition to during the following season. As a result, the Astros were fined $5 million and docked several top draft picks, while Astros manager A. J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow were suspended for one year; both were subsequently fired. However, Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred opted against punishing any of the players involved or revoking the Astros' World Series title. ESPN writer Sam Miller opined that although competitive and memorable, the 2017 World Series \"produced a champion we all regret having felt happy for\".\nBroadcasting.\nThis was fourth year of eight-year U.S. TV contracts with ESPN, Fox Sports, and TBS. ESPN aired the American League Wild Card Game, Fox Sports 1 and MLB Network split the American League Division Series, and the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports 1 split the American League Championship Series. TBS had the National League Wild Card Game, Division Series, and Championship Series, with sister network TNT used as an overflow channel. The World Series then aired on the Fox broadcast network for the 18th consecutive year."

        "text": "The 2016 Major League Baseball postseason was the playoff tournament of Major League Baseball for the 2016 season. The winners of the Division Series would move on to the League Championship Series to determine the pennant winners that face each other in the World Series.\nIn the American League, the Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers made their second straight postseason appearances respectively, the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox made their second postseason appearances in the past four years, and the Baltimore Orioles made their third appearance in the past five years.\nIn the National League, the San Francisco Giants made their fourth appearance in seven years, the Washington Nationals made their third appearance in the past five years, the Chicago Cubs and New York Mets returned for the second year in a row, and the Los Angeles Dodgers returned for the fourth straight time.\nThe postseason began on October 4, and ended on November 2, with the Cubs defeating the Indians in seven games in the 2016 World Series. It was the Cubs' first title in 108 years, ending the longest championship drought in North American sports history, as well as the Curse of the Billy Goat.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe following teams qualified for the postseason:\nPlayoff bracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nAmerican League Wild Card.\n(4) Toronto Blue Jays vs. (5) Baltimore Orioles.\nThe Blue Jays defeated the Orioles, 5–2, in the 11th inning, when Edwin Encarnación hit a walk-off three-run home run off Ubaldo Jiménez. The Blue Jays returned to the ALDS for the second year in a row.\nThis was the last postseason appearance by the Orioles until the 2023 season.\nNational League Wild Card.\n(4) New York Mets vs. (5) San Francisco Giants.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Mets and Giants, with the last being the 2000 NLDS (won by the Mets). The Giants won 3–0 after a 3-run home run by Conor Gillaspie in the top of the ninth inning as Madison Bumgarner pitched a complete-game shutout in the Wild Card Game for the second time in three years.\nThe Mets would not return to the postseason again until 2022.\nAmerican League Division Series.\n(1) Texas Rangers vs. (4) Toronto Blue Jays.\nThis was the second straight postseason meeting between the Blue Jays and Rangers. The Blue Jays once again emerged victorious, sweeping the Rangers to advance to the ALCS for the second year in a row. In Arlington, the Blue Jays blew out the Rangers in Game 1, and then won Game 2 by a 5–3 score to go up 2–0 in the series headed back to Toronto. The Blue Jays took Game 3 in extra innings, capped off by an error made by Texas' Rougned Odor while attempting a double play — the throw went wide of first baseman Mitch Moreland, which allowed Toronto's Josh Donaldson to run to home plate and clinch the series win for the Blue Jays.\nThis is the last postseason series win by the Blue Jays, as well as the last postseason series ever played at Globe Life Park.\nThe Rangers would not return to the postseason again until 2023.\n(2) Cleveland Indians vs. (3) Boston Red Sox.\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Red Sox and Indians. The Indians won in 1995 and 1998, while the Red Sox won in 1999 and 2007. The Indians swept the Red Sox to return to the ALCS for the first time since 2007.\nThe Indians narrowly took Game 1 by holding off a late Red Sox rally. In Game 2, the Indians shut out the Red Sox, 6–0, thanks to a solid pitching performance from Corey Kluber. When the series shifted to Boston for Game 3, the Tribe struck first with an early lead which they did not relinquish, and closed out the series.\nWith the win, the Indians improved their postseason record against the Red Sox to 3–2. The Red Sox returned to the postseason the next year, but were defeated by the Houston Astros in four games in the ALDS.\nNational League Division Series.\n(1) Chicago Cubs vs. (5) San Francisco Giants.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Cubs and Giants. Their last meeting was in the 1989 NLCS, which the Giants won in five games. The Cubs defeated the Giants in four games to advance to the NLCS for the second year in a row. The Cubs prevailed in a 1–0 shutout in Game 1, and took Game 2 by three runs to go up 2–0 in the series headed to San Francisco. The Giants narrowly prevailed in an ugly 13-inning Game 3 to avoid a sweep, however the Cubs would close out the series with a 6–5 win in Game 4. In Game 4, the Cubs became the first team since 1986 to overcome a 3-run deficit when trailing after eight innings and win the game. However, the Cubs were the first team to complete the feat without requiring extra innings.\nThe Giants were denied the chance to win a fourth World Series title in seven years, officially ending their dynasty. The Giants would not return to the postseason again until 2021.\n(2) Washington Nationals vs. (3) Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between these two teams since the 1981 NLCS, back when the Nationals were known as the Montreal Expos. The Dodgers defeated the Nationals in five games after trailing the series 2–1 to return to the NLCS for the first time since 2013.\nBoth teams would meet again in the 2019 NLDS, which the Nationals won by also overcoming a 2–1 series deficit.\nAmerican League Championship Series.\n(2) Cleveland Indians vs. (4) Toronto Blue Jays.\nThe Indians defeated the Blue Jays in five games to return to the World Series for the first time since 1997. The Indians narrowly took Games 1 and 2 in Cleveland, and when the series shifted to Toronto, they went up 3–0 in the series with a 4–2 win in Game 3. The Blue Jays took Game 4 by four runs to avoid a sweep, however the Indians would close out the series with a 3–0 shutout in Game 5.\nThe Indians set an MLB record with the lowest batting average by a winning team in a postseason series, hitting just .168 against the Blue Jays. They also became the first club to win the AL pennant on the road since the Chicago White Sox did so at Angel Stadium in 2005. As of 2023, this is the last time the Indians won the AL pennant.\nThe 2016 ALCS was part of a streak of success for Cleveland-based teams against their Toronto counterparts, as the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers also defeated the Toronto Raptors in the NBA playoffs in the 2016 Eastern Conference Finals, and the Eastern Conference Semifinals in both 2017 and 2018.\nNational League Championship Series.\n(1) Chicago Cubs vs. (3) Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Cubs and Dodgers. They had last met in the 2008 NLDS, which the Dodgers won in a sweep. The Cubs defeated the Dodgers in six games, advancing to the World Series for the first time since 1945.\nBoth teams split the first two games in Chicago. When the series shifted to Los Angeles for Game 3, the Dodgers shut out the Cubs by a 6–0 score to go up 2–1 in the series. The Cubs blew out the Dodgers in Game 4 to even the series, and then took Game 5 by an 8–4 score to go up 3–2 in the series headed back home. In Game 6, the Cubs shut out the Dodgers, 5–0, to end their long pennant drought and return to the World Series.\nAs of 2023, this is the last time the Cubs won the NL pennant. Even so, they no longer hold the longest pennant drought in MLB, as with their win over the Dodgers, the Seattle Mariners, who have yet to win a pennant since their inception in 1977, now hold the longest pennant drought. The team with the longest pennant drought in the National League now became the Pittsburgh Pirates, who last won it in 1979.\nBoth teams would meet again in the NLCS the next year, which the Dodgers won in five games.\n2016 World Series.\n(AL2) Cleveland Indians vs. (NL1) Chicago Cubs.\nThis World Series featured the two teams with the longest championship droughts in the league - the Cubs' last championship came in 1908, while the Indians' last title was in 1948. In what is considered by many to be one of the greatest World Series ever played, the Cubs defeated the Indians in seven games to win their first title in 108 years, officially ending the Curse of the Billy Goat. The Cubs became the sixth team in World Series history to overcome a 3–1 series deficit to win the title, and the first team to do so since the Kansas City Royals in 1985.\nIn Cleveland, the Indians took Game 1 in a 6–0 shutout, while in Game 2, the Cubs prevailed by a 5–1 score to win their first World Series game since 1945 and even the series headed back to Chicago. In the first World Series game played at Wrigley Field since 1945, the Indians, with help from four pitchers - Josh Tomlin, Andrew Miller, Bryan Shaw, and Cody Allen, shut out the Cubs by a 1–0 score to take a 2–1 series lead. The Indians then took Game 4 by a 7–2 score to go up 3–1 in the series. In Game 5, the Cubs prevailed by a 3–2 score thanks to excellent pitching performances from Jon Lester and Aroldis Chapman to win their first home World Series game since 1945, sending the series back to Cleveland. In Game 6, the Cubs blew out the Indians, 9–3, to force a seventh game, and also made National League history as Jake Arrieta became the first NL starting pitcher to win two road games in a single World Series since Bob Gibson in 1967.\nGame 7 was the most notable contest of the series - the Indians, thanks to a 2-run home run from Rajai Davis, tied the game at six runs a piece. The game went into extra innings, and was then hit with a rain delay for 17 minutes. The Cubs then scored two runs in the top of the tenth. The Indians scored one more run in the bottom of the tenth to cut the Cubs' lead to one, but Kris Bryant picked up an infield ground ball and threw it to Anthony Rizzo, securing the title for the Cubs.\nThe Cubs' victory was the first World Series title for Chicago since 2005, when the Chicago White Sox swept the Houston Astros to end the Curse of the Black Sox. This marked the first time that the Cubs had won the World Series while playing at Wrigley Field. As of 2022, this is the last time that a team from either Ohio or Illinois appeared in the World Series.\nAfter the loss, the Indians now became the team with the longest World Series title drought, which stood at 68 years, and is now 75 years.\nBroadcasting.\nThis was third year of eight-year U.S. TV contracts with ESPN, Fox Sports, and TBS. ESPN aired the National League Wild Card Game, Fox Sports 1 and MLB Network split the National League Division Series, and the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports 1 split the National League Championship Series. TBS had the American League Wild Card Game, Division Series, and Championship Series, with sister network TNT used as an overflow channel. The World Series then aired on the Fox broadcast network for the 17th consecutive year."

        "text": "William Geoffrey Collins (born April 10, 1971) is an American football coach and former player. He is currently serving as the defensive coordinator at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Prior to the Tar Heels, he was the head coach at Georgia Tech from December 7, 2018, to September 25, 2022. He was previously the head coach at Temple University, and had served in the past as defensive coordinator for the University of Florida and Mississippi State University.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nCollins graduated from Rockdale County High School in Conyers, Georgia, where he played for coach and mentor Bob Smith. He went on to play football at Western Carolina University. Following his graduation, Collins served as a student assistant at Western Carolina, his alma mater, during the 1993 and 1994 seasons. Following a year coaching high school, Collins became the linebacker coach for Fordham in 1996 before becoming the defensive coordinator at Albright College from 1997 through 1998. Collins left Albright to become a graduate assistant at Georgia Tech under George O'Leary for the 1999 and 2000 seasons. Following two years in the GA position, Georgia Tech promoted Collins to tight ends coach at for the 2001 season. Collins returned to his alma mater to become Western Carolina's defensive coordinator from 2002 through 2005 before returning to Georgia Tech in 2006 as the Director of Player Personnel. After a year at Alabama as the Director of Player Personnel, Collins was terminated and reunited with O'Leary at UCF as linebackers coach and recruiting coordinator from 2008 through 2009.\nFIU (2010).\nCollins served as the defensive coordinator for Florida International during the 2010 season. Collins' defense led the Sun Belt Conference in total defense, scoring defense and turnover margin.\nMississippi State (2011–2014).\nCollins coached at Mississippi State from 2011 through 2014. During that time, Collins coached All-American Fletcher Cox, who was drafted in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft. Upon being promoted to defensive coordinator in 2013, Collins helped lead a Bulldogs team that finished in the Top 5 in the SEC in total defense, rushing defense and passing defense. In 2014, Collins' Mississippi State defense led the SEC in sacks and had the conference's No. 1 Red Zone defense en route to a 10-3 record.\nFlorida (2015–2016).\nCollins spent two years as the defensive coordinator at Florida underneath Jim McElwain. While with the Gators, Collins oversaw a defense that ranked No. 6 in scoring defense in 2016 and No. 11 in 2015. During the 2015 season, Collins' defense became just the seventh team in the last 20 years to not allow a touchdown against three FBS Power 5 schools on the road in the same season. During his time at Florida, Collins coached five defensive players that were drafted in the 2016 NFL Draft and produced a consensus All-American in Vernon Hargreaves. Hargreaves and safety Keanu Neal were drafted in the first round of the 2016 NFL Draft.\nFollowing the 2015 season, Collins was a candidate to replace O'Leary as the head coach at UCF. Collins interviewed for the position that ultimately went to Scott Frost.\nTemple (2017–2018).\nCollins secured his first head coaching job in December 2016 when he was named Matt Rhule's successor at Temple. Collins had previously worked alongside Rhule at Albright College and Western Carolina.\nIn Collins' first season, Temple went 7–6 and won the 2017 Gasparilla Bowl, the program's first bowl win since 2011 and just its third bowl win overall.\nIn his second season, the Owls started off 0-2 but finished the regular season 8–4 overall and 7–1 in conference play. The Owls qualified for the 2018 Independence Bowl as a result. Along the way, Collins surpassed Steve Addazio as the winningest Temple coach over the first two seasons of their tenure at the school.\nGeorgia Tech (2019–2022).\nOn December 7, 2018, Collins was named the 20th head coach of Georgia Tech football. Collins won three games in each of his first three seasons with the Yellow Jackets, including famously losing to The Citadel, which ran the triple option that Collins has criticized. In 2021, Collins ended his losing streak to FCS opponents when Georgia Tech defeated Kennesaw State, a team who was playing with their fourth string quarterback after a series of unfortunate incidents befell all other eligible quarterbacks. Collins never won back to back games at Georgia Tech. Following a 1-3 start to the 2022 season, and being out scored 210-20 over the final 5 games of his tenure against FBS opponents, Collins was fired by the Yellow Jackets. Collins finished with the worst winning percentage of any permanent head coach in the program's history. Assistant head coach Brent Key took over as interim head coach.\nNorth Carolina (2024–present).\nAfter the dismissal of previous defensive coordinator Gene Chizik, Collins was hired by Mack Brown to fill the vacant defensive coordinator position in Chapel Hill."

Kent also hosted three-day first-class matches at the St Lawrence Ground against Loughborough MCCU and the touring Pakistanis. It was the first season in charge for Director of Cricket Paul Farbrace. The club captain was former England batsman Rob Key who had been club captain since 2006. Kent's overseas players were South African fast bowler Makhaya Ntini until late May, and Sri Lankan leg-spinner Malinga Bandara for the rest of the season.\nKent were relegated from Division One of the County Championship in their first season since promotion from Division Two. They finished second in Group C of the Clydesdale Bank 40 and seventh in the South Group of the Friends Provident t20 (they did not progress to the knock-out stages of either competition).\nSquad.\nIt was announced in December 2009 that former South Africa batsman Justin Kemp would not return for the 2010 season due to changes to the Kolpak regulations under which he had been able to play county cricket since 2005. Kent had already lost fast bowler Martin Saggers after 11 seasons, when the player announced his retirement at the end of the 2009 season due to a serious knee injury.\nIn January, Kent announced that their overseas player would be Australian fast bowler Stuart Clark for the first half of the season, followed by Sri Lankan leg-spinner Malinga Bandara for the second half of the season. Clark had previously signed to play for Kent in the 2009 season, but later withdrew due to a late call up to the Australian tour of South Africa. However, in March 2010 it was announced that, for a second time, Clark would not play for the county – this time due to concerns about his fitness. A week later, Kent announced the signing of South African fast bowler Makhaya Ntini as a replacement for Clark. Ntini signed a five-week deal to play until Bandara arrived in late May.\nSouth African-born Scotland international, Dewald Nel, signed a two-year contract with Kent in March 2010 after impressing while on trial.\nLeg-spin bowler Mark Lawson (cricketer) signed for Kent during the season and played a single match (against the touring Pakistanis), but was later released.\nIn late July, Kent released slow left-arm spinner Rob Ferley 22 year-old medium-fast bowler Warren Lee). Lee would go on to play for the Unicorns (cricket team) in 2012 and 2013. A few days later, Kent released James Hockley from his second spell with the county. Hockley would now concentrate on his teaching career. Phil Edwards was released in late August.\nFast bowler Amjad Khan left Kent at the end of the 2010 season to join Sussex, having been at the county since 2001. Second XI wicket-keeper Paul Dixey also left after the end of the season and signed for Leicestershire."

        "text": "A women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) is an international cricket match between two teams, each having WT20I status, as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport's world governing body. In a women's Twenty20 match, the two teams play a single innings, each of which is restricted to a maximum of 20 overs. The Twenty20 format was originally introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board for the men's county cricket competition with the first matches contested on 13 June 2003 between the English counties in the Twenty20 Cup. The first women's Twenty20 International match took place on 5 August 2004 when New Zealand defeated England by nine runs at the County Cricket Ground in Hove. This match was held six months before the first men's Twenty20 International, contested between Australia and New Zealand in February 2005.\nA five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, especially in the Twenty20 format, as bowlers can bowl no more than four overs in an innings. The first five-wicket haul in a WT20I match was taken by New Zealand's Amy Satterthwaite against England in August 2007. Satterthwaite took six wickets for 17 runs, the first six-wicket haul in the international format. On 26 August 2021, Netherlands' Frederique Overdijk became the first player to take seven wickets in an international Twenty-20 match when she took seven wickets for 3 runs against France during the 2021 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier in Spain. At the same time it became the best bowling figures in an innings surpassing Nepal's Anjali Chand who returned figures of 6 for 0 against the Maldives during the 2019 South Asian Games in Nepal. Tanzania's Nasra Saidi also conceded no runs in her five-wicket haul against Mali during the 2019 Kwibuka Women's T20 Tournament in Rwanda making both figures the most economical with an economy rate of zero. Shabnim Ismail of South Africa took the least economical five-wicket haul, bowling with an economy rate of 7.82 against India in February 2018. At 40 years of age, Chamani Seneviratne playing for the United Arab Emirates is the oldest player to take five wickets in an innings while Botsogo Mpedi of Botswana who returned figures of 6 for 8 against Lesotho during the Botswana 7s tournament in Gaborone in August 2018, is the youngest at 15. Mpedi alongside Chand, Indonesia's Ni Suwandewi and Samoa's Teinemane Faimalo are the only bowlers to take a five-wicket haul on W20I debut. Chand, Hong Kong's Kary Chan, Anisa Mohammed of the West Indies and Nomvelo Sibanda of Zimbabwe all took a hat-trick as part of their T20I five-wicket haul. There have been only five occurrences which did not result in a victory to the team taking the five-wicket haul.\n, 98 five-wicket hauls have been taken in more than 1700 WT20I matches. Anisa Mohammed of West Indies and Kary Chan of Hong Kong have taken three five-wicket hauls each in WT20Is. "

        "text": "The 2017 Monaco Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2017) was a Formula One motor race held on 28 May 2017 at the Circuit de Monaco, a street circuit that runs through the Principality of Monaco. It was the sixth round of the 2017 FIA Formula One World Championship, the seventy-fifth time that the Monaco Grand Prix has been held, and the sixty-fourth time it has been a round of the Formula One World Championship since the inception of the series in .\nFerrari driver Sebastian Vettel entered the round holding a six-point lead over Lewis Hamilton in the World Drivers' Championship, with Valtteri Bottas being third. In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes held an eight-point lead over Ferrari, with Red Bull Racing a further eighty-one points behind in third.\nKimi Räikkönen started the race from pole position, his first since the 2008 French Grand Prix. In doing so, he broke Giancarlo Fisichella's record for the most race starts between pole positions, with one hundred and twenty-nine starts since his last pole. Sebastian Vettel won the race, Ferrari's first win in Monaco since 2001. Räikkönen finished second as this was Ferrari's first 1–2 finish since 2010 German Grand Prix. Daniel Ricciardo finished third. With the result, Vettel extended his Drivers' Championship lead over Lewis Hamilton, while in the World Constructors' Championship, Ferrari reclaimed the points lead from Mercedes.\nThis was also the 306th and final Grand Prix start for World Champion Jenson Button.\nReport.\nBackground.\nMcLaren driver Fernando Alonso missed the race in order to participate in the Indianapolis 500. Alonso became the first active Formula One driver to race at the Indy 500 since Teo Fabi in 1984. Jenson Button replaced Alonso for the race.\nPrior to the national anthem, a minute's silence was observed on the grid before the race as a mark of respect to the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing earlier in the week.\nFree practice.\nThursday morning's first practice ended with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton setting the quickest lap with 1:13.425, approximately 0.2 seconds quicker than his championship rival Sebastian Vettel. Max Verstappen was third quickest and Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat was the fastest driver not in one of the top three teams, setting the sixth fastest time. In second practice, Vettel was quickest with 1:12.720. Second through fourth were Daniel Ricciardo, Kimi Räikkönen, and Kvyat. The Mercedes team had a disappointing second practice as they finished eighth and tenth, off the pace of their championship rivals Ferrari. The session was stopped part way through for ten minutes due to a crash by Lance Stroll.\nSaturday's Free Practice 3 ended with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel setting the bar at 1:12.395, besting his own time set in FP2 by 0.3 seconds to set a new lap record, whilst nearest rival and teammate Kimi Räikkönen was 0.3 seconds behind with 1:12.740. The session was interrupted 8 minutes in by yellow flags when Esteban Ocon of Force India crashed in the swimming pool section, mimicking an incident Max Verstappen had during the 2016 qualifying session. Free practice eventually resumed with 4 minutes remaining. Daniel Ricciardo had a brake-by-wire failure and ended up retiring from the session, leaving him sixth with 1:13.392. McLaren driver Jenson Button ended the session in twelfth, but incurred a 15-place grid penalty for changing the MGU-H and turbocharger, which would be applied after qualifying.\nQualifying.\nFerrari's Kimi Räikkönen qualified on pole position for the first time in 9 years; his last pole position came at the 2008 French Grand Prix, also for Ferrari. His teammate and championship leader Sebastian Vettel qualified second, followed by Valtteri Bottas and Max Verstappen. Vettel's closest rival, Lewis Hamilton, qualified in fourteenth; he struggled warming up the tyres and his final flying lap in Q2 was impeded by Stoffel Vandoorne who had crashed towards the end of the session. Despite Vandoorne's accident, both McLarens had made it into Q3 for the first time in 2017; Jenson Button qualified in ninth place on his return, but due to his fifteen-place grid penalty would start from the back of the grid, and eventually opted to start from the pit lane.\nRace.\nRäikkönen led from the start until he pitted on lap 33. His teammate Vettel stayed out longer and when he eventually pitted, he came out ahead of Räikkönen and went on to win his 3rd race of the season and extended his championship lead to 25 points over Hamilton, who finished in 7th in a recovery drive after his poor qualifying. This win gave Ferrari their first 1-2 finish since the controversial 2010 German Grand Prix. Daniel Ricciardo finished in 3rd, despite lightly hitting the wall late in the race, jumping both Bottas and Verstappen by staying out longer on the ultra-softs in a strategy akin to Sebastian Vettel. Carlos Sainz had his best finish of the year so far with 6th for Toro Rosso. He was followed by Hamilton, Grosjean, Massa and Magnussen, who rounded off the points. It was the first time in Haas' history that they achieved a double points finish. It was also the first time in 2017 that both Force Indias finished out of the points with a late collision between Pérez and Kvyat, while running in the points, sent Pérez to last and Kvyat out of the race. Stoffel Vandoorne looked set to score McLaren's first points of the season before hitting the wall after being forced onto the breaking up asphalt by Sergio Pérez. Jenson Button, meanwhile, retired with suspension damage on his one-off return, much like his original retirement in the 2016 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, after colliding with Sauber's Pascal Wehrlein, leaving Wehrlein perched up vertically on the wall. The other Sauber of Marcus Ericsson retired after hitting the wall at turn 1 under the safety car. The Renault of Nico Hülkenberg retired early on with a gearbox failure, while running in 10th. Lance Stroll was another retiree.\nAfter the race Sergio Pérez and Jenson Button had two penalty points (each) added to their Super Licences, both for causing a collision."

        "title": "2017 British Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2017 British Grand Prix (formally known as the 2017 Formula 1 Rolex British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that took place on 16 July 2017 at the Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, United Kingdom. This race was the seventy-second running of the British Grand Prix, the sixty-eighth time that the race has been run as a World Championship event, and the fifty-first time that the World Championship event has been held at the Silverstone Circuit. \nFerrari driver Sebastian Vettel entered the round with a twenty-point lead over Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship. Mercedes led Ferrari by thirty-three points in the Constructors' Championship.\nThe race was dominated and won by Lewis Hamilton, who achieved a grand slam: starting from pole position, leading every lap of the race, setting fastest lap, and winning with a 14-second lead over Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas. \nWith his fifth British Grand Prix win, Hamilton equalled the records of Alain Prost and Jim Clark, who won the race five times each. His championship rival Sebastian Vettel suffered a tyre failure with two laps to go and finished seventh. As a result, Vettel's lead over Hamilton in the Drivers' standings was cut down to one point. Kimi Räikkönen, Vettel's teammate, suffered the same problem while in second position and lost his place to Bottas, and managed to finish third.\nReport.\nBackground.\nOn 11 July 2017, the BRDC, the owners of Silverstone, activated a break clause in their contract meaning unless a new contract is signed, 2019 will be the final year the British Grand Prix takes place at Silverstone.\nAs the race was on the week of the British premiere of \"Cars 3\", there was a special pit garage for Lightning McQueen and Jackson Storm. McQueen's voice actor, Owen Wilson, was in attendance, alongside director Brian Fee and producer Kevin Reher. They visited the garages of Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel, and Fernando Alonso, who voice the English, German, and Spanish voices of the built-in voice command assistant Hamilton. Wilson also experienced the Silverstone circuit with a ride in the F1 Experiences two-seater car.\nPractice.\nThe first free practice session saw the public début of the \"shield\" cockpit protection device, a reinforced perspex crash structure mounted to the monocoque. The shield is designed to provide additional driver protection by deflecting debris away from a driver's head without compromising the ability of marshalls to access the cockpit in the event of an accident. The initial testing was carried out by Ferrari to assess the shield's design ahead of a planned introduction in . Sebastian Vettel responded negatively to the design, cutting short his testing of the device and subsequently reporting that the concave shape of the shield distorted his vision and made him feel dizzy.\nMercedes's Valtteri Bottas went fastest in first practice, setting a time of 1:29.106. He was followed by his teammate Lewis Hamilton and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen in second and third. In second practice, Bottas was fastest followed by Hamilton and Räikkönen. Saturday's third and final practice was topped by Hamilton, with Vettel second and Bottas third. Hamilton set the quickest time of all three practices with a 1:28.063, closely followed by Vettel who set a 1:28.095.\nQualifying.\nQ1 was affected by rain and most drivers used intermediate tyres. Daniel Ricciardo's Red Bull experienced a turbo failure, ending his qualifying run. Fernando Alonso opted to change to supersoft tyres during the final minutes of Q1 as the track dried. He subsequently set the fastest time of the session, a 1:37.598.\nIn Q3, Lewis Hamilton secured pole position with a 1:26.600, 0.547 seconds quicker than Kimi Räikkönen in second, and 0.756 seconds quicker than Vettel in third. Nico Hülkenberg gave Renault team its best qualifying result since its return to F1 in 2016, with fifth. Hamilton's pole equalled Jim Clark's record for most poles at the British Grand Prix. Valtteri Bottas set the fourth fastest time during Q3 but started from ninth position after being set back five places as a result of an unauthorised gearbox change. Subsequently, Max Verstappen started fourth.\nRace.\nIn the formation lap Jolyon Palmer suffered a hydraulic failure and retired from the race. Another formation lap was held and thus the Grand Prix was shortened to 51 laps instead of the scheduled 52 laps.\nAt the start, Hamilton easily pulled away opening a 1.6 seconds gap to Räikkönen after just one lap. Sebastian Vettel, starting from third, was overtaken by Max Verstappen. Valtteri Bottas started his slow run towards what would become a second place, overtaking both McLaren Honda driver Stoffel Vandoorne and Sergio Pérez in a Force India, who started from eight and sixth respectively. \nA crash of the Toro Rosso drivers Carlos Sainz Jr. and Daniil Kvyat, caused by Kvyat, brought out the safety car on lap 2, with Sainz retiring while Kvyat continued but finished the race only fifteenth after receiving a drive-through penalty.\nAt the restart, once again Hamilton pulled away and, in the following laps, opened a gap towards second placed Kimi Räikkönen which allowed him to cruise to victory. Meanwhile, Bottas continued his charge and got up to fifth place before lap 7, overtaking Esteban Ocon and Nico Hülkenberg.\nVettel, after the restart, was stuck behind the Red Bull of Max Verstappen and the two banged wheels as Vettel tried to overtake. Verstappen stayed in third but Vettel eventually got out in front of him after he pitted on lap 18, one lap earlier than Verstappen.\nBottas, who was the only one of the top ten who started on the slower but more durable soft tyres instead of supersoft versions, stayed out until lap 32 and then pitted for the supersoft tyres. As he set fastest lap he soon caught up to Vettel and overtook him on lap 44, moving up into third.\nMeanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo, who started from 19th on the grid, also moved up, overtaking, among others, Fernando Alonso, Sergio Pérez and Kevin Magnussen. He eventually finished fifth.\nIn the final laps, both Ferraris suffered punctures. On lap 49 Kimi Räikkönen suffered a puncture on his left front tyre. With a relatively short distance to the pits, Räikkönen only lost second place to Bottas and still managed to finish third. Vettel's puncture came on lap 51 with almost the entire lap remaining to return to the pits with a blown tire. Losing a significant amount of time, the blow out dropped him down to seventh place.\nAs a result of the race, Hamilton narrowed the gap to Vettel in the Drivers' Championship to just one point, while Mercedes expanded their lead in the Constructors' Championship to 55 points over Ferrari.\nThe result marked Hamilton's fifth career grand slam. Additionally, Hamilton equaled the record for most British Grand Prix wins held jointly by Alain Prost and Jim Clark."

        "text": "The 2017 Italian Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Gran Premio Heineken d'Italia 2017) was a Formula One motor race held on 3 September 2017 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in Monza, Italy. It was the thirteenth round of the 2017 FIA Formula One World Championship, and marked the 87th running of the Italian Grand Prix and the 82nd time the race was held at Monza.\nFerrari driver Sebastian Vettel entered the round with a seven-point lead over Lewis Hamilton in the World Drivers' Championship, with Valtteri Bottas forty-one points behind in third. In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes led Ferrari by thirty-nine points with Red Bull Racing in third. Hamilton started the race from pole position, the sixty-ninth of his career. With this pole position, he broke Michael Schumacher's record for the most pole positions in a career.\nThe race concluded with Hamilton leading the championship by 3 points ahead of Vettel.\nThe grid order for the race was considered somewhat farcical, due to the number of grid penalties that were taken in the race equalling 150 and making the grid almost unrecognisable from the qualifying results. Only 4 drivers started in their qualifying positions, with only Hamilton of the four not having taken a penalty. Sergio Pérez, meanwhile, moved up 1 place on the grid despite having a 5-place grid penalty.\nReport.\nPractice.\nMercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas set the fastest times in first and second practice respectively, with times of 1:21.537 and 1:21.406.\nThird practice was disrupted by heavy rain on the circuit, and the green flag was only shown with 16 minutes remaining. Williams driver Felipe Massa set the quickest time with a 1:40.660.\nQualifying.\nThe heavy rains that delayed the start of Free Practice 3 remained over the region, causing qualifying to be interrupted. The session started on time, but was red-flagged when Romain Grosjean spun into the barriers. After almost two hours of waiting for the track to clear up, the session resumed with Lewis Hamilton taking pole ahead of the two Red Bulls. Due to grid penalties for both Red Bulls, Lance Stroll was promoted to second, becoming the youngest front row starter in a Formula One race. Esteban Ocon was promoted to third ahead of Bottas, Räikkönen and Vettel.\nRace.\nThe race was welcomed by clear sky with Hamilton on pole ahead of Stroll and Ocon. Hamilton got away well as Stroll was conservative into turn 1 and was passed by Ocon. Further behind there was contact between Massa and Perez. A few laps later, Verstappen moved to the outside at turn 1 but hit Massa which caused Verstappen to get a right front tyre puncture. The stewards took no further action. There were good battles further behind including Räikkönen, Ocon and Stroll. During the only round of pit stops (most drivers made only one stop in the race), all these drivers retained their positions. Further behind, Ricciardo was 5th but overtook Räikkönen into turn 1 and closed in on Vettel. In the end, Mercedes finished with a 1–2, with Lewis Hamilton winning ahead of the second-placed Valtteri Bottas. Vettel finished third ahead of a charging Ricciardo. On the final lap, Massa attacked Stroll but couldn't overtake him and finished 8th. Verstappen recovered from the early puncture to finish 10th after small incidents with the two Haas drivers (Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen)."

It was the fourteenth round of the 2017 FIA Formula One World Championship, and marked the eighteenth running of the Singapore Grand Prix, the tenth time the race had been held at Marina Bay.\nMercedes driver Lewis Hamilton entered the round with a three-point lead over Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in the World Drivers' Championship, with Valtteri Bottas third. In the Constructors' standings, Mercedes led Ferrari by 62 points, while Red Bull Racing were third.\nThe race was won by Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton who took the lead on the first lap following a significant collision between Sebastian Vettel, Max Verstappen and Kimi Räikkönen. Daniel Ricciardo finished second with Valtteri Bottas taking third. This result increased Hamilton's lead in the Drivers' Championship to 28 points and increased Mercedes's lead in the Constructors' standings to 102 points.\nReport.\nPractice.\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo went fastest in first practice with a time of 1:42.489. He was followed by the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel and his teammate Max Verstappen while championship leader Lewis Hamilton was only fourth fastest. Ricciardo was also quickest in second practice, followed by Verstappen and Hamilton.\nQualifying.\nMax Verstappen was quickest in both Q1 and Q2 as Red Bull seemed to have the advantage over Mercedes and Ferrari. However, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel took pole in the final session with a lap time of 1.39.491, ahead of Verstappen and teammate Ricciardo. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton could only take fifth on the grid with teammate Bottas sixth.\nRace.\nRainfall prior to the race start meant that the race would be the first night-time Grand Prix staged under wet conditions in Formula One history. Despite this, the race was started under normal racing conditions without the safety car as per 2017 rule changes. At the start, Räikkönen had an excellent start compared to his teammate Vettel and Verstappen of Red Bull. Verstappen ended up sandwiched between Vettel and Räikkönen with nowhere to go. Verstappen's tyres touched Räikkönen's car, which went out of control and he hit left sidepod of his teammate Vettel's car, causing significant damage to both. His car then slid forward into turn 1, where it hit Verstappen's car yet again, causing the Red Bull car to collide with Fernando Alonso's car. This resulted in the immediate retirement of both Räikkönen and Verstappen. Vettel was initially able to continue despite noticeable damage, followed by Hamilton, who had a good start with Ricciardo behind. However, Vettel soon spun due to the damage and subsequently retired. Alonso retired on lap 9. The collisions on the opening lap brought out a safety car that led the field until lap 4. This marked the first occasion in Formula One history when both Ferraris were eliminated on the opening lap. At the restart Lewis Hamilton continued to lead, followed by Daniel Ricciardo in second and Nico Hülkenberg in third. Hamilton then was able to pull away and establish a comfortable lead over Ricciardo.\nThere were two further safety car periods over the course of the race. One on lap 11, after Daniil Kvyat crashed at turn 7, and one on lap 38 after Marcus Ericsson spun. Bottas managed to get up to third and Carlos Sainz to fourth after the first safety car period as those on full wets ahead of them pitted for inters, the tyres Bottas and Sainz were already on. Hamilton was again able to get away well at both restarts. Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hülkenberg – from 4th position after passing Sainz in the second safety car period – would both retire later in the race with mechanical issues. Hamilton won the race from Ricciardo, and Valtteri Bottas took the final podium place, while Sainz achieved his then career-best finish of 4th place. Jolyon Palmer came home in 6th place for his first points finish of the season, on the same weekend it was announced he would be replaced by Sainz at the end of the season. The drivers did not complete the scheduled race distance of 61 laps due to the 2-hour time limit being reached, so the chequered flag was shown on lap 58."

Hamilton's teammate Valtteri Bottas sat third, a further twenty-five points behind. In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes held a lead of one hundred and eighteen points over Ferrari, with Red Bull Racing a further one hundred and fifteen points behind in third place.\nRace.\nBefore the race started Sebastian Vettel's mechanics were working on his car. When the race started it was clear he had some serious issues with the car losing positions immediately as Lewis Hamilton led away. Carlos Sainz had an accident on the opening lap, with the safety car being deployed. Soon after the race restarted Vettel retired with engine problems.

The flag bearers from each participating country entered the stadium informally in single file, and behind them marched all the athletes. The flags of each country were not necessarily carried by the same flag bearer as in the opening ceremony. The flag-bearers entered in \"ganada\" order of the Korean alphabet.\nUnlike the opening ceremony, North and South Korea used their own flags in addition to the Korean Unification Flag. Thus there were a total of 93 flag bearers representing 92 NOCs, with the North Korean flag and Korean Unification Flag appearing earlier in the parade order, and the South Korean flag appearing last.\nCountries and flagbearers.\nThe following is a list of each country's flag bearer. The list is sorted by the order in which each nation appears in the parade of nations. Names are given as were officially designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)."

The race was won by Sanne Cant of Belgium, winning her first title.\nRace report.\nThe fastest starter was Ellen Van Loy who took the head start but did not manage to get away from the bunch. At the end of the first lap, eight riders were still within 6 seconds: Eva Lechner, Marianne Vos, Sanne Cant, Kateřina Nash, Lucinda Brand, home rider Christine Majerus, surprise Maghalie Rochette and Van Loy.\nVos, Cant and Brand opened up a gap and separated as a group; Vos tried several times to break away but Cant each time managed to close the gap with Brand trailing slightly. On the fourth of five laps, Cant slipped and lost about ten seconds, therefore Vos went into the final lap with eight seconds advantage. Meanwhile, Nash had come back from behind and was leading Brand by a few seconds for third place.\nOn the final lap, Vos' chain dropped, forcing her to step off the bike and manually put it back in place which allowed Cant to close the gap. The two battled it out on the slippery last half lap, overtaking each other several times. At the final real obstacle, a steep descent, Cant was able to overtake Vos and kept the lead onto the final straight, outsprinting Vos to take her first world title. Twenty seconds later, Nash outsprinted Brand for third place."

Discussion of the NRC competition was included on Fox Sports' review show NRC Extra Time on Monday nights, and the Kick &amp; Chase program on Tuesday evenings.\nExperimental Law Variations.\nThe trialed changes to the point scoring system adopted in previous years were not continued for the 2017 NRC season, and scoring reverted to the standard values of five points for a try, two for a conversion and three for a penalty or drop goal.\nThe remaining law variations used in 2016 were retained for the 2017 season. Also adopted were World Rugby's six amendments to the program of trial laws for 2017, relating to the tackle/ruck (Law 15.4 (c), 16, and 16.4 variations) and scrum (Law 20, 20.5 (d), and 20.9 (b) variations).\nRegular season.\nThe nine teams played in a round-robin for the regular season, each team having four matches at home and four away. The top four teams qualified for the semi-finals with the respective winner meeting in the final.\nDuring this section of the competition, teams also played for the Horan-Little Shield, a challenge trophy put on the line when a challenge is accepted by the holders or mandated by the terms of competition for the shield.\nPoints for the regular season standings were accumulated by the same method as for The Rugby Championship and Super Rugby. A slightly modified version of the standard competition points system was used, with a bonus point awarded to a winning team scoring at least 3 tries more than their opponent; and a bonus point awarded to a losing team defeated by a margin of 7 points or under. Four points were awarded for a win and none for a loss; two points were awarded to each team if a match was drawn.\nEach team's placement was based on its cumulative points total, including any bonus points earned. For teams level on table points, tiebreakers apply in the following order:\nThe top four teams at the end of the regular season qualified for the title play-offs in the form of semi-finals followed by a final to determine the champion team.\nCompetition rounds.\nAll kick-offs listed are in local time.\nRound 6.\nPasifika Round\nFinals.\nThe top four sides in the regular season advanced to the semifinals of the knock-out stage, which was followed by the final to decide the National Rugby Championship title."

        "text": "Edward Heathcote Williams (23 March 1859 – 28 November 1931) was a New Zealand lawyer, farmer and cricket administrator.\nEarly life and family.\nHeathcote Williams was one of 11 children, eight boys and three girls, to John William Williams and Sarah nee Busby. His father was a New Zealand politician, and his grandfather Henry Williams was a missionary who arrived in New Zealand in 1823. His maternal grandfather was James Busby, the British Resident in New Zealand, who arrived in 1833. One of his brothers, Kenneth, was also a New Zealand politician.\nWilliams was educated at Auckland Grammar School. After three years working in a bank in Wellington he was articled to a lawyer there. He was admitted as a barrister and solicitor in 1883, and began practising in Hastings in 1884. He opened an office in Napier in 1888. He was for many years the borough solicitor for Hastings.\nCricket career.\nHeathcote Williams' playing record was modest – one first-class match for Hawke's Bay in 1891–92 when he captained his side to an innings victory over Taranaki – but he became one of the leading cricket administrators in New Zealand.\nHe was the president of the Hawke's Bay Cricket Association from 1892 until his death in 1931. In Christchurch on 27 December 1894, as a delegate from Hawke's Bay, he presided at a meeting of 12 delegates from around New Zealand at which the New Zealand Cricket Council was formed. He was elected the inaugural president. In all he served as president of the Council eight times."

        "text": "The 2021 IHF World Women's Handball Championship, the 25th event by the International Handball Federation, was held in Spain from 1 to 19 December 2021. On 18 October 2018, at a congress in Doha, Qatar, the IHF announced that the World Championship would be expanded from 24 teams to 32 teams from 2021 onwards.\nThe Netherlands were the defending champions after winning for the first time in 2019. However, they finished third in their main round group and failed to qualify for the quarterfinals.\nNorway defeated France to win their fourth title. Denmark captured the bronze medal by winning against Spain.\nBidding process.\nSpain and Hungary bid for the right to organise the 2021 Women's World Handball Championship. The International Handball Federation decided that the voting process would take place during the 2017 World Men's Handball Championship.\nThe Spanish bid included the following six host cities and venues:\nThe President of the Royal Spanish Handball Federation confirmed that full support is granted by the Olympic Movement, Spanish government and the handball community. The Spanish government guaranteed the introduction of all necessary measures so that the event could be celebrated in a full security setting, with special attention paid to key infrastructures for the staging of the competitions and to IHF operations, its subsidiaries and delegations from different countries.\nThe Hungarian bid included the following six host cities and venues:\nThe 2021 Women's World Handball Championship was awarded to Spain by a secret ballot of members of the IHF Council.\nVenues.\nThe tournament is being played in the following venues: Llíria, Torrevieja, Castelló and Granollers as the final four venue.\nQualification.\n1. On 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed on Russia. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russian sportspeople to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation. Like the men's team, the Russian women's team played under the alternative name of the sport's domestic governing body, the Russian Handball Federation.\n2. Since 2018 countries from Oceania (Australia and New Zealand) are participating in the Asian Championships: if one of them finishes within the top five, it qualifies for the World Championship. Otherwise the place transfers to the wild card spot.\n3. Since Oceania did not register a team for the upcoming Asian qualification event, the IHF Council awarded two Wild Cards for the 2021 IHF Women’s World Championship in Spain, namely to the National Federations of Slovakia and Poland.\n4. As the 2021 Asian tournament was only played with 11 teams instead of 12, only five teams qualified and a wild card was granted to China.\nDraw.\nThe draw took place on 12 August 2021 at 22:00 in Castellón, Spain.\nSeeding.\nThe seeding was announced on 8 August 2021. As organizer, Spain had the right to choose their group. The Asian, North and South American teams were not known at the time of the draw.\nReferees.\n18 referee pairs were selected on 12 October 2021.\nSquads.\nEach team consists of up to 18 players, of whom 16 may be fielded for each match.\nPreliminary round.\n\"All times are local (UTC+1).\"\nMain round.\nAll points obtained in the preliminary round against teams that advanced as well, were carried over.\nFinal ranking and awards.\nPlaces 1 to 4 and 25 to 32 were decided by play-off or knock-out. The losers of the quarter finals were ranked 5th to 8th according to the places in the main round, points gained and goal difference. Teams finishing third in the main round were ranked 9th to 12th, teams finishing fourth in the main round were ranked 13th to 16th, teams finishing fifth in the main round were ranked 17th to 20th and teams ranked sixth were ranked 21st to 24th. In case of a tie in points gained, the goal difference of the main round was taken into account, then number of goals scored. If teams were still equal, number of points gained in the preliminary round were considered followed by the goal difference and then number of goals scored in the preliminary round.\nAll-Star team.\nThe all-star team and MVP was announced on 19 December 2021."

        "text": "The 2018 Royal Rumble was the 31st annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on January 28, 2018, at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was the third Royal Rumble held at this venue after the 2004 and 2015 events, and was the first to include a women's Royal Rumble match, and consequently, two Royal Rumble matches, which is now standard for the event.\nTraditionally, the Royal Rumble match winner receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. With the introduction of a women's Royal Rumble match, two Royal Rumble matches were contested on the card with the winners of each receiving a choice of which championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 34. The men could choose to challenge for either Raw's Universal Championship or SmackDown's WWE Championship, while the women had the choice between the Raw Women's Championship and the SmackDown Women's Championship.\nIn total, nine matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, Raw's Asuka won the first-ever women's Royal Rumble match by last eliminating SmackDown's Nikki Bella. This was also the second women's match to main event a WWE pay-per-view, and the first to main event one of WWE's \"Big Four\" pay-per-views. The men's Royal Rumble match was won by SmackDown's Shinsuke Nakamura, who last eliminated Raw's Roman Reigns. Other prominent matches included Brock Lesnar retaining Raw's Universal Championship in a triple threat match against Braun Strowman and Kane, and AJ Styles retained SmackDown's WWE Championship against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn in a handicap match. The event was also notable for the surprise debut of former UFC mixed martial artist Ronda Rousey following the women's Rumble match, officially confirming that she had signed full-time with WWE.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick event produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. Announced on January 26, 2017, the 2018 event was the 31st Royal Rumble and was scheduled to be held on January 28, 2018, at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was the third Royal Rumble held at this venue after the 2004 and 2015 events. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions with some NXT wrestlers and WWE veterans appearing in the Royal Rumble matches. In addition to airing on traditional pay-per-view worldwide, the event was available to livestream on the WWE Network. Tickets went on sale on July 29.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. It was originally only contested by male wrestlers. However, for 2018, Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon scheduled the first-ever women's Royal Rumble match to be held at the 2018 Royal Rumble, which consequently made the 2018 event the first to include two Rumble matches, which is now standard. As a result, the winners of each match received a choice of which championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 34. The men could choose to challenge for either Raw's Universal Championship or SmackDown's WWE Championship, while the women had the choice between the Raw Women's Championship and the SmackDown Women's Championship.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised nine matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\nOn the October 16, 2017, episode of \"Raw\", Kane returned from a ten-month hiatus and helped Braun Strowman to defeat Roman Reigns in a Steel Cage match. Kane was then added to Strowman's team at in the 5-on-3 handicap Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. During the match, Kane accidentally hit Strowman with a chair, which caused tension between the two. Later on in the match, Kane turned on Strowman and crushed him in the back of a garbage truck; their team ultimately lost. The two then feuded over the next several weeks, leading to a match on the December 11 episode to determine the number one contender against Brock Lesnar for the Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble, but the match ended in a double countout. Raw General Manager Kurt Angle then decided that Lesnar would defend the title against both Kane and Strowman in a triple threat match at the event. On the January 8 episode, Kane attacked Lesnar from behind, followed by an attack from Strowman. After laying Kane and Lesnar out backstage, Strowman knocked over a lighting rig and crushed both. Lesnar was taken to a medical facility while Kane refused medical attention. Due to his actions, Strowman was removed from the triple threat match and fired by Angle. Strowman went on a rampage backstage, including destroying Angle's office and flipping over a tractor. Before he could do any more damage, Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon rehired Strowman, putting him back into the Universal Championship match at the Royal Rumble.\nAfter Survivor Series, several women from NXT were promoted to the main rosters of both Raw and SmackDown. On the November 20, 2017, episode of \"Raw\", Paige, who had been out with an injury since June 2016, returned along with the debuts of NXT's Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville, forming the heel group Absolution, while similarly on the November 21 episode of \"SmackDown\", NXT's Ruby Riott, Liv Morgan, and Sarah Logan debuted and formed the heel group The Riott Squad. On the December 18, 2017, episode of \"Raw\", with a larger roster of women on the main rosters, Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon scheduled the first-ever women's Royal Rumble match for the 2018 Royal Rumble, with the winner receiving a match at WrestleMania 34 for the top championship of their choice: Raw's Women's Championship or SmackDown's Women's Championship. Both brands' respective commissioners and general managers agreed that the women's match would have all of the same rules as the men's match, including having 30 participants. Stephanie was announced to join the commentary team for the women's match, and television host Maria Menounos was announced to be the special guest ring announcer.&lt;ref name=\"pre-show/event additions\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAt Clash of Champions, SmackDown's Commissioner Shane McMahon and General Manager Daniel Bryan both refereed a tag team match pitting Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn against Randy Orton and Shinsuke Nakamura, where Owens and Zayn would have been fired from WWE had they lost. During the match, there was controversy between Shane and Bryan, which resulted in Bryan giving a fast count for Owens and Zayn to win. Tensions between Shane and Bryan continued over the next couple of weeks, culminating on the final \"SmackDown\" of 2017, when Bryan scheduled Owens to face WWE Champion AJ Styles in a non-title match in the main event, much to the disapproval of Shane, who felt that Owens should not be in the main event, or facing the WWE Champion. That match ended when Zayn interfered, allowing Owens to win. The next week, Zayn would also defeat Styles in a non-title match after interference from Owens. Enraged at back-to-back losses, Styles stated they might as well schedule him in a handicap match against Owens and Zayn, which Bryan took literally and scheduled for the Royal Rumble where Styles would also defend the WWE Championship against both men. On the January 9 episode of \"SmackDown\", Styles said that although it was unfair, he was confident that he would win; Owens and Zayn interrupted and claimed that they would become the first-ever co-WWE Champions. On the final \"SmackDown\" before the Royal Rumble, Styles faced Owens and Zayn in back-to-back matches where Shane threatened that if one were to interfere in the other's match, that person would be fired. Styles managed to defeat Owens in the first match by submission, however, he would lose to Zayn in the second match.\nOn the December 18, 2017, episode of \"Raw\", Seth Rollins' tag team partner Dean Ambrose was injured by Samoa Joe. The following week, despite both wanting to take on Joe to avenge Ambrose, Raw General Manager Kurt Angle instead had his (storyline) son, Jason Jordan, and Rollins team up to face Cesaro and Sheamus for the Raw Tag Team Championship; Jordan and Rollins defeated Cesaro and Sheamus to win the championship. After the former champions confronted Angle about their contractual rematch, Angle scheduled it for the Royal Rumble. On the January 15 episode, Jordan caused a distraction, allowing Titus Worldwide (Apollo Crews and Titus O'Neil) to again defeat Cesaro and Sheamus in a rematch from the previous week, which Rollins disapproved of as he did not like Jordan acting on his own. Cesaro and Sheamus would try and return the favor during Rollins' match against Finn Bálor, but it backfired, resulting in Rollins winning, and Cesaro and Sheamus brawling with Bálor Club members, Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, at ringside. On \"Raw 25\" the next week, Jordan and Rollins were the guests on Christian's \"The Peep Show\", which Cesaro and Sheamus interrupted and the two teams brawled where Rollins accidentally hit Jordan with a knee attack that was intended for Cesaro.\nAt Clash of Champions, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) retained the SmackDown Tag Team Championship in a fatal four-way match against Rusev and Aiden English, The New Day's Big E and Xavier Woods, and Chad Gable and Shelton Benjamin. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Gable and Benjamin defeated The Usos in a non-title match, and they were awarded with a championship match on the first \"SmackDown\" of 2018, where they defeated The Usos to initially win the titles after pinning Jimmy Uso; however, Jimmy was not the legal man, and thus the match was restarted and The Usos retained their championship. The following week, Gable and Benjamin confronted SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan over the incident. After questioning if they should have to defeat The Usos twice in the same night, Bryan decided that at the Royal Rumble, The Usos would defend the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against Gable and Benjamin in a two out of three falls match.\nOn January 26, three matches were announced for the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show. For SmackDown, it was announced that United States Champion Bobby Roode would have an open challenge for the title. Two tag team matches were scheduled for Raw: a rematch between Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson and The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson) from \"Raw 25\", and a six-man tag team match for the cruiserweight division with Kalisto, Gran Metalik, and Lince Dorado against Drew Gulak, TJP, and Gentleman Jack Gallagher.\nCancellations.\nTwo other matches had been promoted for the event, but were later removed.\nThe first was the tournament final for SmackDown's then-vacant United States Championship. Originally scheduled for the PPV, the finals were instead contested on the January 16 episode of \"SmackDown\", where Bobby Roode defeated Jinder Mahal to win the title.\nThe second was a championship match for the Raw brand where WWE Cruiserweight Champion Enzo Amore was scheduled to defend the title against Cedric Alexander. However, after Amore was suspended from WWE on January 22 due to allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault, the match was canceled. Amore was released the next day and the title was vacated.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThree matches were contested during the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show. In the first match - featuring the cruiserweight division - Kalisto, Gran Metalik, and Lince Dorado faced TJP, Gentleman Jack Gallagher, and Drew Gulak in a six-man tag team match. Kalisto performed a \"Salida Del Sol\" on TJP to score the win.\nNext, also from Raw, The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson) faced Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. Dawson performed a chop block on Anderson to score the win.\nFinally, SmackDown's United States Champion Bobby Roode issued an open challenge, which was answered by fellow SmackDown wrestler Mojo Rawley. Roode performed a \"Glorious DDT\" on Rawley to score the pinfall and retain the title.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with AJ Styles defending the WWE Championship against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn in a handicap match. In the end, Styles threw Zayn out of the ring and immediately Owens performed a superkick on Styles. Owens - who was not the legal man - attempted a pop up powerbomb on Styles, who countered into a roll up to retain the title. In a backstage segment, Owens and Zayn confronted SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon about the incident; however, after questioning if he saw what had happened, Shane smiled, replied \"Yep\", and walked off.\nNext, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against Chad Gable and Shelton Benjamin in a two out of three falls match. Jimmy and Jey performed a double superkick on Gable, who was kneeling, to score the first fall. Jey then pinned Benjamin with a small package to score the second fall to retain the titles.\nAfter that, the 30-man Royal Rumble match for a world championship match at WrestleMania 34 was contested. Rusev and Finn Bálor began the match as the first and second entrants, respectively. Baron Corbin (#4) eliminated Rhyno (#3), but was eliminated by Bálor. Corbin attacked Bálor, Rusev, and Heath Slater (#5), who just made his entrance. NXT Champion Andrade \"Cien\" Almas was a surprise entrant at #7. Tye Dillinger was scheduled to be #10, but was attacked backstage by Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn, resulting in Zayn taking Dillinger's spot. Afterwards, Sheamus (#11) tossed Slater back in the ring, where Slater eliminated Sheamus in two seconds, but was eliminated by Bray Wyatt (#8) afterwards. Shinsuke Nakamura entered at #14 and eliminated Zayn. Jinder Mahal (#18) eliminated New Day members Big E (#9) and Xavier Woods (#12), but as he tried to eliminate Kofi Kingston, Kingston landed on Woods, and placed his foot on a plate of pancakes. When Mahal prevented Kingston from re-entering the ring, Big E and Woods sent Kingston back in the ring, after which, Kingston performed Trouble in Paradise on Mahal before eliminating him. Afterwards, Almas performed a Hammerlock DDT on Kingston before eliminating him. Afterwards, Matt Hardy (#19) teamed with Wyatt, and after they fought each other, they simultaneously eliminated each other. John Cena entered at #20 and eliminated Elias (#6) and The Hurricane (a surprise entrant at #21). NXT's Adam Cole, another surprise entrant, entered at #23. Randy Orton (#24) performed an \"RKO\" on Almas and eliminated him after a near 30-minute run. Rey Mysterio, another surprise entrant, entered at #27 and eliminated Cole. Roman Reigns entered at #28 and eliminated Titus O'Neil (#25). Reigns and Seth Rollins (#18) teamed up and performed a powerbomb on The Miz (#26) over the top rope to eliminate him, after which, Reigns immediately eliminated Rollins. Dolph Ziggler, making his return after vacating the United States Championship, entered at #30 and eliminated Goldust (#29), but was eliminated by Bálor. Reigns performed a superman punch on Orton and eliminated Orton. Mysterio performed a \"619\" on Cena and Reigns, but was eliminated by Bálor. Bálor, Nakamura, Cena, and Reigns were the final four. Cena eliminated Bálor (who lasted nearly an hour) and immediately afterwards fought with Nakamura, who performed a \"Kinshasa\" on Cena to eliminate him. Nakamura attacked Reigns and attempted a \"Kinshasa\", however, Reigns countered into a spear. As Reigns attempted to eliminate Nakamura, Nakamura countered, performed a \"Kinshasa\" on Reigns and then eliminated Reigns to win the match. Afterward, Renee Young interviewed Nakamura and asked which world championship he wanted to challenge for at WrestleMania 34. He called out WWE Champion AJ Styles, thus choosing the WWE Championship and staying on SmackDown.\nNext, Seth Rollins and Jason Jordan defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Cesaro and Sheamus. During the match, Jordan sustained a head injury (after being thrown into the ring post by Cesaro), rendering him unable to compete. In the end, Sheamus and Cesaro performed a \"White Noise\"/diving neckbreaker combination on Rollins to win the titles for a record-setting fourth time as a team, and a record-setting fifth time for Cesaro individually.\nIn the fifth match, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman and Kane in a triple threat match. Lesnar drove Kane into a corner, but Strowman caught Lesnar and drove him into the opposite corner. Strowman attacked Lesnar with a running dropkick and performed a clothesline on Kane. As Lesnar attempted an \"F-5\" on Strowman, Kane performed a chokeslam on Lesnar. Before he could cover him, Strowman attacked Kane, drove him back into his corner, and performed 2 headbutts on him. As Kane attempted a chokeslam on Strowman, Lesnar struck Kane with a chair, only for Strowman to punch the chair out of Lesnar's hand, perform a clothesline on him, and throw him and Kane outside the ring. At ringside, Strowman drove Lesnar into the barricade and struck Kane with the steel steps. Strowman retrieved two tables under the ring and brought Kane back in the ring. Strowman positioned both tables at two opposite corners, with one standing up and the other next to the turnbuckles. As Kane attempted a chokeslam on Strowman, the latter countered into his own chokeslam on Kane. However, Lesnar broke up the pinfall at a two count and performed three German suplexes on Strowman. Strowman performed a running powerslam on Lesnar through the standing table, only for Kane to break up the pinfall at a two count. As Strowman attempted another powerslam on Kane through the other table, the latter then drove Strowman through it instead, and performed a chokeslam on him, with Lesnar breaking up the pinfall at a two count. Lesnar performed an \"F-5\" on Kane, but before he could cover him, Strowman performed a German suplex on Lesnar, who rolled outside the ring. Once again at ringside, Strowman drove Lesnar into the barricade. Lesnar then performed an \"F-5\" on Strowman through an announce table and overturned another announce table on top of Strowman (in a reversal of what happened last year at Summerslam, though where Lesnar had to be stretchered out and then returned, Strowman stood back up in defiance). As Kane attempted a chokeslam on Lesnar, the latter countered and then performed another \"F-5\" on Kane through the third announce table. Strowman recovered and performed a kick to Lesnar, who fell head-first into the steel steps. Back in the ring, Strowman performed two running powerslams on Lesnar, but Kane returned and struck Strowman with a chair, driving him outside the ring. As Kane attempted a Tombstone piledriver on Lesnar, the latter shoved Kane into Strowman (who was about to return to the ring), knocking him off the ring apron. Lesnar performed an \"F-5\" on Kane onto the chair and pinned him to retain the title. After the match, an enraged Strowman returned to the ring and yelled at Lesnar that he did not beat and pin him.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the first-ever 30-woman Royal Rumble match for a women's championship match at WrestleMania 34. Sasha Banks and Becky Lynch were the first and second entrants, respectively. Sarah Logan entered at #3, followed by Mandy Rose at #4 and WWE Hall of Famer Lita at #5. After Lita eliminated Rose, Kairi Sane entered at #6. Sane managed to take down Lynch and Banks before Tamina entered at #7. Lita performed a Moonsault on Lynch and Banks, and eliminated Tamina, but was eliminated by Lynch. Dana Brooke (#8) eliminated Sane before being eliminated by Torrie Wilson (#9), who was in turn eliminated by Sonya Deville (#10). Liv Morgan (#11) teamed up with Logan to take down Banks before Molly Holly (#12) eliminated Logan. Morgan and Deville double-teamed Lana (#13). Michelle McCool (#14) ended up eliminating Deville, Morgan, Holly, and Lana. After Ruby Riott entered at #15, Vickie Guerrero entered at #16, after which, all the women eliminated her from the match. Guerrero then struck Carmella (#17) with the Money in the Bank briefcase before leaving. Natalya (#18) tried to eliminate Kelly Kelly (#19), who performed a headscissors on McCool, who was then eliminated by Natalya. After Naomi entered at #20, Riott eliminated Lynch. Jacqueline (#21) and Natalya were unable to eliminate Kelly, after which, Nia Jax (#22) eliminated Jacqueline and Kelly. Jax then eliminated Riott, and sent Naomi out of the ring and into the other women, but Naomi was not eliminated. After NXT Women's Champion Ember Moon entered at #23, Naomi saved herself from elimination by using a commentator chair to make it back to the ring. However, moments later, Naomi was eliminated by Jax. Beth Phoenix entered at #24 and tried to power up Jax, but was unable to. Phoenix and Natalya knocked Jax out of the ring, after which, Natalya turned on Phoenix and eliminated her. Asuka entered at #25 and battled with Moon. Moon was able to perform the Eclipse on Asuka, however, Asuka was able to eliminate Moon. Mickie James entered at #26 followed by Nikki Bella at #27. After Carmella mocked John Cena's \"You Can't See Me\" gesture at Nikki, Nikki eliminated Carmella. Nikki's tag team partner, Brie Bella, entered at #28 followed by Bayley at #29. The final entrant, Trish Stratus, performed a double bulldog on The Bella Twins. After taking out Bayley, Stratus and James had a showdown, with Stratus eliminating James. Afterwards, all the other women eliminated Jax from the match before Banks turned on Bayley and eliminated her. Stratus then eliminated Natalya, but after mocking Banks, Banks eliminated her from the match. The final four were Banks, Asuka, Nikki, and Brie. Banks, Nikki, and Brie attacked Asuka, but as Banks went for her double knee press on Asuka, Nikki and Brie eliminated Banks (who lasted the longest at nearly 55 minutes). Asuka attacked Nikki and Brie, but Nikki performed a Rack Attack 2.0 on Asuka and then eliminated Brie. Nikki sent Asuka over the top rope, but Asuka held on. Asuka then headscissored Nikki over the top rope and onto the apron. A short time later, Asuka kicked Nikki's legs out to win the match and earn a women's championship match at WrestleMania 34. After the match, Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss and SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair entered the ring. Before Asuka could make her decision for which title she wanted to challenge for, they were interrupted by the surprise appearance of former UFC star Ronda Rousey, officially confirming she had signed full-time with WWE. Rousey pointed to the WrestleMania sign and offered a handshake to Asuka, who refused. Rousey then shook hands with Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon as the event ended. The jacket which Rousey wore during this appearance belonged to lifelong idol Roddy Piper, whose son let her borrow it.\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nOn \"Raw\" the following night, Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon convinced Asuka to wait until after Elimination Chamber to make her decision, as Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss was scheduled to defend her title in the first-ever women's Elimination Chamber match, and the result may affect Asuka's decision. Asuka was then confronted by Sasha Banks, who spent the longest time in the Royal Rumble match, and Banks challenged Asuka to a match that Asuka won. Banks, along with Bayley, Mandy Rose, Mickie James, and Sonya Deville were announced as the other competitors in the Elimination Chamber match. Nia Jax was also scheduled to face Asuka at Elimination Chamber where if she were to win, she would be added to the Asuka's championship match at WrestleMania. On the February 12 episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that Ronda Rousey would sign her Raw contract at Elimination Chamber. At SmackDown's Fastlane pay-per-view, Asuka appeared and decided to challenge Charlotte Flair for the SmackDown Women's Championship at WrestleMania.\nSince Shinsuke Nakamura decided to stay on SmackDown to challenge for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 34, Raw General Manager Kurt Angle scheduled a number one contender's Elimination Chamber match at the namesake event to determine who would face Brock Lesnar for the Universal Championship at WrestleMania. Six qualification matches were scheduled over the next couple of weeks. Braun Strowman and Kane battled in a Last Man Standing match, which Strowman won to qualify. After the match, Kane was taken to a local hospital. Elias, John Cena, Roman Reigns, Intercontinental Champion The Miz, Finn Bálor, and Seth Rollins also qualified, marking the first seven-man Elimination Chamber match.\nNew Raw Tag Team Champions Cesaro and Sheamus defended their titles against Titus Worldwide (Apollo Crews and Titus O'Neil), as they had beaten Cesaro and Sheamus two weeks in a row prior to the Royal Rumble; Cesaro and Sheamus retained. The following week, Jason Jordan and Seth Rollins were scheduled to have their contractual rematch, but after Jordan was deemed unable to compete, he was replaced by Roman Reigns. Jordan, however, accidentally caused them to be disqualified.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Shinsuke Nakamura celebrated his win at the Royal Rumble, and said he would become the new WWE Champion at WrestleMania 34. He was interrupted by Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn, who said that they should be the co-WWE Champions, but the referee failed at his job at the Royal Rumble. WWE Champion AJ Styles came out and said that Owens and Zayn could complain all they want, but there would be a dream match at WrestleMania between him and Nakamura. Styles then suggested to have a dream team that night with him and Nakamura facing Owens and Zayn, which SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan made official for later that night in which Styles and Nakamura won. During the match, there were tensions between Owens and Zayn as Bryan had also scheduled them to face each other the following week to determine the number one contender for the WWE Championship at Fastlane. The championship match at Fastlane then became a fatal five-way match also involving Baron Corbin and Dolph Ziggler, and finally a six-pack challenge when John Cena qualified by defeating Styles in a non-title match.\nIn the mid-card, a fatal four-way match between Kofi Kingston of The New Day, Jinder Mahal, Zack Ryder, and Rusev occurred to determine the number one contender against Bobby Roode for the United States Championship, which was won by Rusev, who was unsuccessful in winning the title. Also following the Royal Rumble, SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan revealed the first-ever \"SmackDown Top Ten List\" as voted on by the SmackDown roster to see who the wrestlers thought should get a title opportunity. This played into a storyline between Roode, who ranked fifth, Randy Orton, who ranked ninth, and Jinder Mahal, who did not rank, resulting in SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon scheduling Roode to defend the U.S. Championship against Orton at Fastlane.\nIn the women's division, SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair praised the first-ever women's Royal Rumble match, but wished that she could have competed in it. She addressed Ronda Rousey's debut and questioned who her WrestleMania 34 opponent would be. The Riott Squad interrupted and Ruby Riott said Flair would not make it to WrestleMania and they attacked Flair. Carmella came out to try and cash-in her Money in the Bank briefcase on Flair, but was not able to as she accidentally knocked out the referee before the bell could ring. After feuding with The Riott Squad over the next few weeks, Flair was scheduled to defend her title against Riott at Fastlane.\n205 Live.\nOn \"205 Live\", Drake Maverick (formerly known as Rockstar Spud in Impact Wrestling) was appointed as the 205 Live General Manager. Maverick announced that there would be a 16-man single elimination tournament to crown a new WWE Cruiserweight Champion, with the finals to occur at WrestleMania 34.\nResults.\nMen's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations.\nBrand\n(*) - Tye Dillinger was announced as the #10 entrant, but was attacked backstage by Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn, resulting in Zayn taking his spot.&lt;br&gt;\n(**) - Heath Slater spent significant time outside of the ring before officially entering the Rumble, due to being attacked on the ramp by Baron Corbin, Elias, Andrade, Bray Wyatt, Big E, Sami Zayn, and Sheamus.&lt;br&gt;\n(***) - WWE.com's official website lists Sheamus' time to be 20 seconds, but they have otherwise stated 2 seconds.&lt;br&gt;\n(****) - Matt Hardy eliminated himself at the same time he eliminated Bray Wyatt.\nWomen's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations.\nBrand\n(*) - Kairi Sane was a last minute replacement for Alicia Fox, who was originally scheduled to participate in the match, but got injured just prior to the event."

The team is coached by Christie Martens, she is in her 17th year at Iowa State. The Cyclones play their home meets at Veenker Memorial Golf Course on Iowa State's campus.\nHistory.\nThe Iowa State women's golf team first got it start in 1972, initially competing in the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW). Off the heels of their hot start the Cyclones appeared in three AIAW Championships in their first 12 years of existence, finishing top 25 each time. During these early year individual success was highlighted by Barb Thomas, the high point of her career at ISU was becoming the first and only women's golf All-American in program history. Thomas would go on to have an 18-year career on the LPGA Tour.\nAfter almost a decade of struggles Iowa State again flourished under coach Julie Manning. They reached the NCAA Regional four straight years from 1993-1996 in addition to their first and only Big Eight conference championship in 1993. Two individual successes during this time period were Beth Bader and Shelly Finnestad. Bader still holds the record for most top-10 and top-five finishes as a Cyclone with 24 and 12 respectively. She would finish second in the 1993 Big Eight conference championship to Shelly Finnestad before going on to having a 13-year LPGA Tour career. Finnestad's 1993 conference title remains the only Cyclone championship to date.\nAfter another lull in success coach Christie Martens has taken the Cyclones to new heights. In her 17th year at Iowa State she is currently on a streak of seven straight NCAA regional appearances, including finishing 23rd overall at the 2014 NCAA National Championship. Some of the individual successes under her leadership include Punpaka Phuntumabamrung finishing as runner-up at the 2013 Big 12 Tournament and Chonlada Chayanun tying for seventh overall at the 2014 NCAA tournament.\nIn 2022, Ruby Chou became the first Iowa State player to individually qualify for the championship with an Iowa State Regional record of 211. She was soon joined by her teammate, Taglao Jeeravivitaporn, who defeated Northwestern's Jieni Li in a playoff for the second spot.\nVeenker Memorial Golf Course.\nNamed for George F. Veenker, head football coach at Iowa State from 1931 to 1936. He was also Athletic Director from 1933 until 1945. The golf course was completed in 1938 and given its current name in 1959.\nThe 6,543-yard, par-72, George Veenker Memorial Golf Course is located just two blocks north of the Iowa State campus. The 18-hole course was constructed in 1938 from the design of world-renowned golf course architect, Perry Maxwell (re-designer of the seventh and 10th holes at Augusta National Golf Club in 1937). The golf course was built with WPA and Athletic Council funds, and cost $122,373. The course hosted the conference championships in 1982 and 1989, two regional AIAW championships, and hosts the annual Iowa Masters Championship. It also hosted the 1949 NCAA national championship, in which Arnold Palmer was a participant.\nThe team practices at the newly opened $2 million Golf Performance Center located three miles from campus. The 16-acre facility was designed by world renowned architech Keith Foster to be used exclusively by the Iowa State men's and women's golf team."

NZPBA is a non-profit organisation.\nHistory.\nThe Body was founded as South Pacific Boxing Association, with the name changed to New Zealand Professional Boxing Association inc in 1984 at their AGM. The new name was greeted and accepted by the World Bodies and Commonwealth Boxing Council.\nIn 2006, NZPBA had their first female national champion with Daniella Smith defeating Sue Glassey for the Super Welterweight title. Smith is New Zealand's second professional National Champion.\nIn April 2016, NZPBA sanctioned New Zealand's first major world title fight (from one of the four major sanctioning bodies) for the WBC female middleweight title with Kali Reis defeating Maricela Cornejo by split decision. The fight night also featured two of New Zealand's first WBC Silver title fights with Melissa St. Vil defeating Baby Nansen and Ronica Jeffrey defeating Gentiane Lupi. On the same night, NZPBA had New Zealand's first female professional boxing referee, with Shelley Ashton officiating Nailini Helu vs. Kirsty Lupeamanu.\nControversy.\nFormer NZPBA President Lance Revill, is well known to stating his opinion to New Zealand's local media, causing major scrutiny to the association. Most recently, his comments were more directed at Joseph Parker. Since the beginning of Parker's career, Revill has made regular comments about Parker including when he turned pro, Parker's promoters only being interested in money, Parker being too hyped up and his belief that Parker didn't win his world title fight in December 2016. In February 2017, it was announced that due to the backlash of his comments against Parker, Revill resigned as president of NZPBA. Vise President John Conway was named interim President.\nIn 2018, NZPBA officiated a corporate boxing event in Christchurch in November where first time corporate boxer Kain Parsons, was knocked unconscious. Kain Parsons was taken to Christchurch Hospital's intensive care unit, however, Parsons died four days later after the event. Vise President of the organisation at time Kevin Pyne was the referee of the fight. Former NZPBA President Lance Revill stated that he believed the fight should have been stopped earlier. In 2019, Kevin Pyne was elected president of NZPBA, despite being the referee of the fight.\nCurrent roles.\nBoard members.\nPresident: Kevin Pyne\nVise President: 1st John Conway, 2nd David Kettle\nNational Secretary: Fiona Moore\nNational Treasurer: Pat Leonard\nWebmaster: Raylyne Siaosi and Kendall Cooper\nDoctors: David Renata &amp; Shaaren Jacobs\nRegional Representatives.\nNorthland &amp; Auckland: Jo Gallagher and Mal Siaosi\nBay of Plenty &amp; Waikato: Bob Mitchell\nManawatu &amp; East/West Coast: Shelley Ashton\nWellington Supervisor: Ian Scott\nSouth Island Supervisor: Paul Fitzimmons"

        "text": "Patrick Brian Murphy (born June 10, 1995) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays and Washington Nationals.\nAmateur career.\nMurphy attended Hamilton High School in his hometown of Chandler, Arizona. In 2012, he underwent Tommy John surgery, and missed the entire 2013 season as a result. He had committed to attend the University of Oregon before being selected in the third round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft by the Toronto Blue Jays. He signed with the Blue Jays for a $500,000 bonus, and reported to Dunedin, Florida for rehab.\nProfessional career.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nMurphy made his professional debut with the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League Blue Jays in 2014. After pitching four innings, he was shut down with hand and arm numbness. It was later determined that one of his ribs was pinching a nerve, and underwent surgery to remove the rib shortly afterward. The numbness persisted, which led doctors to remove a nerve in his pitching elbow, which caused him to miss the entire 2015 season. Fully healthy for 2016, Murphy split time between the Short Season-A Vancouver Canadians and the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts. He made 21 appearances during the 2016 season, 15 of which were starts, and posted a 4–6 win–loss record, 3.18 earned run average (ERA), and 68 strikeouts in 90 innings pitched. Murphy made most of his appearances in 2017 for Lansing, and also played in the GCL and for the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays. In total he went 5–4 with a 3.04 ERA and 77 strikeouts in 106 innings.\nThe Blue Jays added Murphy to their 40-man roster after the 2018 season. On September 18, 2020, the Blue Jays promoted Murphy to the major leagues for the first time, and he made his debut against the Philadelphia Phillies. With the 2020 Toronto Blue Jays, Murphy appeared in four games, compiling a 0-0 record with 1.50 ERA and five strikeouts in six innings pitched.\nOn February 28, 2021, Murphy was placed on the 60-day injured list due to a sprained AC joint in his shoulder. He was activated off of the injured list on June 16. On August 11, Murphy was designated for assignment by the Blue Jays.\nWashington Nationals.\nThe Washington Nationals claimed Murphy off waivers on August 14, 2021, and assigned him to their Triple-A affiliate, the Rochester Red Wings. \nMurphy made 6 appearances for Washington in 2022, posting a 6.35 ERA with 4 strikeouts in 5.2 innings pitched. He was designated for assignment on April 21, 2022. Murphy cleared waivers and was sent outright to Triple-A Rochester on April 27. He spent the remainder of the year there, making 40 appearances and pitching to a 3-3 record and 5.00 ERA with 73 strikeouts in 63.0 innings of work. He elected free agency on November 10, 2022.\nMinnesota Twins.\nOn December 13, 2022, Murphy signed a minor league deal with the Minnesota Twins with an invite to spring training. He elected free agency on November 6. \nHokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters.\nOn November 21, 2023, Murphy signed with the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball."

        "title": "William McKenzie (rugby union)",
        "text": "William \"Mac\" McKenzie (12 June 1871 – 1 July 1943), also known as \"Offside Mac\", was a rugby union player who represented New Zealand in the 1890s. Playing at wing-forward, McKenzie was first selected for the New Zealand national team on their 1893 tour of Australia, and continued to be selected up until the end of New Zealand's 1897 tour of Australia. In his 20 matches for the national side, McKenzie scored 23 points.\nMcKenzie was first selected provincially for Wairarapa in 1889 at the age of 18. He eventually relocated to Wellington in 1893, and joined the Petone Rugby Club. He was selected for Wellington that year, and was included in the New Zealand team to tour Australia. The 1893 tour of Australia was the first New Zealand team selected under the authority of the newly formed New Zealand Rugby Football Union. Captained by Thomas Ellison, the team played eleven matches, including three against New South Wales, and lost only one. McKenzie, playing at wing-forward, appeared in nine matches on the tour, including the team's only loss, which was to New South Wales. He did not appear in any test matches as New Zealand did not play its first full international until 1903.\nMcKenzie became infamous for being the first New Zealand player ordered off. In the last of the tour's matches against New South Wales referee Edward McCausland ordered McKenzie from the field. In the process of walking off McKenzie feigned a leg injury by limping, and the crowd, unaware he had been sent off and now believing he was injured, applauded him.\nWhen New South Wales toured New Zealand in 1896 McKenzie was selected for the New Zealand team that faced them, and he played for his country again in 1896 when Queensland toured New Zealand. The following year New Zealand again toured Australia, with McKenzie selected in the Alfred Bayly captained team. The side won nine of their ten matches, with their one loss coming against New South Wales.\nMcKenzie was regarded, along with a few others at the time, as one of the most gifted thinkers in New Zealand rugby, and he played a pivotal role in developing the unique wing-forward position. He was also the eldest of a highly influential rugby family; his younger brothers Jack, Ted, Bert, and Norman all made significant contributions to the sport in New Zealand as administrators, selectors, referees, or players.\nNewspaper career.\nIn 1903, McKenzie began working for the \"Wairarapa Leader\" newspaper, which was subsequently subsumed by the \"Wairarapa Daily News\". He then moved to \"The Dominion\" in Wellington as circulation manager and organiser, before accepting a position at \"The New Zealand Herald\". Eventually McKenzie, afflicted by rheumatism, moved to Melbourne, Australia, for health reasons, where he was circulation manager for \"The Herald\" and \"The Sun\". McKenzie died suddenly in the Melbourne suburb of Caulfield on 1 July 1943, and was buried at Box Hill Cemetery."

        "title": "2018 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for 2018 proceeded according to rules most recently amended in 2016. As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players. The results were announced on January 24, 2018, with the BBWAA electing Chipper Jones, Vladimir Guerrero, Jim Thome and Trevor Hoffman to the Hall of Fame. Jones and Thome were elected in their first year of eligibility.\nThe three voting panels that replaced the more broadly defined Veterans Committee following a 2010 rules change were replaced by a new set of four panels in 2016. The Modern Baseball Era Committee convened on December 10, 2017, to select from a ballot of retired players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the sport between 1970 and 1987, with Jack Morris and Alan Trammell elected by this body. The formal induction ceremony was held at the Hall's facilities in Cooperstown, New York, on July 29, 2018.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA election rules remained identical to those that were in effect for the most recent elections. The BBWAA voted at the 2016 winter meetings to make all Hall of Fame ballots public one week after the results were announced, effective with this election. However, the Hall rejected the BBWAA's proposal, and ballots remain confidential unless individual voters choose to reveal them (which is allowed by Hall of Fame rules).\nAnother recent rules change, announced in 2015, tightened the qualifications for the BBWAA electorate. Beginning with the 2016 election, eligible voters must not only have 10 years of continuous BBWAA membership, but also be currently active members, or have held active status within the 10 years prior to the election. A BBWAA member who has not been active for more than 10 years can regain voting status by covering MLB in the year preceding the election. As a result of the new rule, the vote total in 2016 decreased by 109 from the previous year, to 440.\nThe ballot included two categories of players:\n422 ballots were cast, 20 fewer than in 2017.\nThere were 422 ballots cast, with a total of 3570 votes for individual players, an average of 8.46 names per ballot—the highest per-ballot average since 1960 (8.51 votes per ballot).\nVoting results from 2018:\nPlayers who were eligible for the first time in 2018 but were \"not\" on the ballot included Rod Barajas, Miguel Batista, Geoff Blum, Miguel Cairo, Aaron Cook, Francisco Cordero, Juan Cruz, Brian Fuentes, Bill Hall, Willie Harris, Nick Johnson, Adam Kennedy, Rodrigo López, Mike MacDougal, Guillermo Mota, Will Ohman, Vicente Padilla, Carl Pavano, Scott Podsednik, Juan Rivera, J. C. Romero, Brian Schneider, Ben Sheets, Jeff Suppan, Kip Wells, Dan Wheeler and Jack Wilson.\nScott Rolen's 10.2% was the lowest first-year vote percentage in history for a candidate who was eventually elected by the BBWAA. He was voted in on the 2023 ballot.\nModern Baseball Era Committee.\nOn July 23, 2016, the Hall of Fame announced changes to the Era Committee system. The system's timeframes were restructured to place a greater emphasis on the modern game, and to reduce the frequency at which individuals from the pre-1970 game (including Negro league baseball figures) will have their careers reviewed. Considering candidates whose greatest contributions occurred from 1970 to 1987, the Modern Baseball Era Committee met in 2017 as part of the elections for the next calendar year.\nOn November 6, 2017, the Hall announced the 10 candidates to be considered when the Modern Baseball Era Committee met at the 2017 winter meetings near Walt Disney World on December 10, with the voting results announced immediately after the committee met. The cutoff for election and induction remained the standard 75%, or 12 of 16 votes.\nThe committee consisted of the following individuals:\nAll candidates except Miller were living when the ballot and voting results were announced. Mattingly, Morris, Murphy and Trammell were being considered for the first time; the others had been considered at least once by one of the predecessors to this committee. Garvey, John, Miller, Parker and Simmons were most recently considered in 2014 by the former Expansion Era Committee, and Tiant was most recently considered by the former Golden Era Committee in 2015. Among players, Simmons was the only candidate who was not on the BBWAA ballot for the full 15-year period formerly allowed by Hall rules; he received less than 5% when he debuted on the BBWAA ballot in 1994 and thus did not appear on further ballots. The Hall changed the eligibility period to 10 years starting with the 2015 election, but Trammell and Mattingly (who were then past the new 10-year cutoff) retained their original 15-year eligibility window.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is now given the previous day at the Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum.\nThe three finalists for the 2018 award were announced during the 2017 All-Star break.\nOcker was announced as the recipient during the 2017 winter meetings on December 12. He covered the Cleveland Indians for more than three decades, serving as Cleveland Indians beat reporter for the \"Beacon-Journal\" from 1981 until his retirement at the end of the 2013 season. Ocker received 168 of the 426 ballots cast (including two blanks) to Reeves' 143 and Reusse's 113.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nVarious changes in July 2016 were also made to the annual Ford C. Frick Award elections, presented annually to a preeminent baseball broadcaster since 1978. According to the Hall, the new criteria for selection are \"Commitment to excellence, quality of broadcasting abilities, reverence within the game, popularity with fans, and recognition by peers.\"\nAdditionally, a ballot of eight candidates will now be set, down from 10 in years past. The three ballot slots previously determined by fan voting on Facebook will now be filled by a committee of historians.\nA new election cycle has been established, rotating annually between \"Current Major League Markets\" (team-specific announcers) with the 2017 Frick Award; \"National Voices\" (broadcasters whose contributions were realized on a national level) with the 2018 Frick Award; and \"Broadcasting Beginnings\" (early team voices and pioneers of baseball broadcasting) with the 2019 Frick Award. This cycle will repeat every three years.\nThe Hall announced the following finalists for the 2018 Ford C. Frick Award on October 23, 2017.\nFour finalists were members of the Hall of Fame as players—Dean, Drysdale, Morgan and Reese. When the ballot was announced, Buck, Costas, Michaels and Morgan were still alive. The other four were deceased.\nCostas was announced as the recipient at the 2017 winter meetings on December 13. He began his sportscasting career as a play-by-play caller for the Spirits of St. Louis in the American Basketball Association, and went from there to calling NBA and NFL games for CBS, but made his greatest mark as part of NBC's broadcast team for its national MLB telecasts from 1982 to 2009. Costas then joined the MLB Network, where he was serving as the network's documentary host when he was announced as the Frick Award recipient."

        "title": "2017 PBA Tour season",
        "text": "2017 is the 58th season of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour. The 2017 schedule includes 24 singles title events, two doubles title events, and one non-title team event (PBA League). \nTournament schedule and recaps.\nFor the second year in a row, the PBA held three consecutive major tournaments in \"Big February\": The Barbasol PBA Players Championship, Fire Lake PBA Tournament of Champions, and the USBC Masters. The U.S. Open took place October 25 through November 1.\nThe season's final major, the PBA World Championship, was again part of the World Series of Bowling (WSOB), which took place November 7–19 at the National Bowling Stadium in Reno, Nevada. WSOB IX consisted of four \"animal oil pattern\" tournaments (Cheetah, Chameleon, Scorpion and Shark), each of which are standalone PBA title events while collectively serving as initial qualifying for the PBA World Championship. Total pinfall from the 40 games of animal pattern qualifying (10 games per tournament) determined the 49 bowlers for the Cashers Round of the World Championship. Cashers then bowled 20 more games (5 on each oil pattern) to determine the top five for the November 19 stepladder finals. \nIn April, the PBA announced the first-ever Main Event PBA Finals, held May 18–20 in Orlando, Florida and broadcast for five consecutive Tuesdays on CBS Sports Network, starting May 30. This is an invitational event that serves as a type of bowling \"playoffs\", similar to The Chase for the Cup in NASCAR or the FedEx Cup in PGA golf. The event featured the top eight players in PBA Tour earnings, from the start of the 2015 season through this year's USBC Masters. Players were seeded 1–8 based on earnings, and split into Group 1 (1, 4, 5 and 8 seeds) and Group 2 (2, 3, 6 and 7 seeds). The groups bowled a mixed roundrobin match play session of four matches each, which made up the first two broadcasts. Players were then re-seeded within their groups, based on total pinfall plus a 50 pin bonus for every match win. Group 1 and Group 2 stepladder matches were held next, and were broadcast in the third and fourth weeks. The Group 1 and Group 2 winners then faced off in the fifth and final broadcast in a three-game, total pinfall head-to-head match to determine the PBA Finals champion.\nFor a second straight year, the PBA kept a rolling points list for all of the season's Xtra Frame tournaments (so designated because they are broadcast start-to-finish on the PBA's Xtra Frame subscription webcast service). Last season, a $10,000 winner-take-all bonus was awarded to the top points earner in the series. For 2017, the Xtra Frame series was renamed the XF PBA Tour Storm Cup, with Storm Bowling sponsoring an expanded award platform. The top points earner in 2017 won a $20,000 bonus, with additional payouts for second through fifth-place finishers ($10,000, $8,000, $7,000 and $5,000). Seven tour stops made up the Storm Cup series. Two additional tournaments (DHC PBA Japan Invitational and PBA-PWBA Striking Against Breast Cancer Mixed Doubles) were also covered exclusively by Xtra Frame, but did not qualify for Xtra Frame series points.\nTournament summary.\nBelow is a current schedule of events for the 2017 PBA Tour season. Major tournaments are in bold. Career PBA title numbers for winners are shown in parentheses."

        "title": "2017 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "Roger Federer's 2017 tennis season officially commenced on 2 January 2017, with the start of the Hopman Cup, and ended on 18 November 2017, with a loss in the semifinals of the ATP Finals.\nThis season is regarded by some as one of the greatest comeback seasons of all time. It saw Federer return from an injury shortened 2016 season that saw him drop to world No. 16 in the ATP rankings. This season marked a renaissance and a return to success for Federer, winning two majors, the Australian Open and the Wimbledon Championships, marking the first season since 2009 in which he won multiple majors. Federer won a total of seven titles in the season, the most since 2007, and with a win–loss record of 54–5 his winning percentage was the highest since 2006. With these accomplishments, the season was statistically Federer's most successful in over a decade.\nYear summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nHopman Cup.\nAfter returning from injury, prior to the Australian Open, Federer paired with Belinda Bencic to compete in the Hopman Cup, representing Switzerland. They were knocked out in the round robin stage after winning two out of three ties. Federer played three singles matches during the event, winning two and losing one against Alexander Zverev.\nAustralian Open.\nIn his first major tournament of the year, Federer progressed all the way to the final, winning over top 10 players Tomáš Berdych, Kei Nishikori, and fellow countryman Stan Wawrinka, to face his archrival Rafael Nadal in the final. Nadal had won all six matches between the two in major tournaments since the Wimbledon final of 2007, including all three of their encounters at the Australian Open. Federer ultimately triumphed after being a break down in the fifth set, winning a record-extending and historic 18th men's singles Grand Slam title and becoming the first man to win at least five singles titles at three different major tournaments each, while denying Nadal's second opportunity to become the first man in the Open Era to win each major in men's singles twice. His previous record of winning at least four titles at three majors was also unmatched. Federer's campaign in winning the Australian Open 2017 title saw three of his matches going to five sets (fourth round against Nishikori, semi-final against Wawrinka, and final against Nadal) and the five-set major final was the 7th in Federer's career, which broke the record tie with Björn Borg of a career count of 6 five-set major men's singles finals. With the Australian Open 2017 title, Federer's ATP ranking rose from No. 17 to No. 10 and marked his first win over Nadal in a Grand Slam match outside the grass courts of Wimbledon.\nDubai Tennis Championships.\nUpon his return to Dubai, Federer beat Benoît Paire in the first round, but was upset in the second round by world No. 116 and qualifier Evgeny Donskoy in three sets, despite holding three match points in the second set, being up a break in the third set, and being ahead by four points in the third set tiebreak.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nFederer began the tournament by defeating Stéphane Robert and Steve Johnson in straight sets to set up a meeting with Nadal. Federer won in straight sets, marking the first time he had ever achieved three consecutive wins over the Spaniard. He reached the semifinals with a walkover from Nick Kyrgios due to food poisoning and reached the final after beating Jack Sock in straight sets. He defeated fellow countryman Stan Wawrinka in two sets in the final, to win a record-equaling fifth title in Indian Wells and the 90th title of his career. With this title, Federer's ranking rose from No. 10 to No. 6. This is the seventh time Federer has won a Masters 1000 title without dropping a set, and was only broken once in the entire tournament. At the age of 35, he became the oldest Masters 1000 finalist and winner ever, ahead of Andre Agassi who won the Cincinnati title in 2004 at the age of 34.\nMiami Open.\nAfter receiving a bye in the first round, Federer won his first match in Miami in straight sets against teenager Frances Tiafoe. He defeated Juan Martín del Potro and Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, he edged Tomáš Berdych in a close match, saving two match points in a third-set tiebreak and successfully avenged his fourth round loss to Berdych at this tournament in 2010. In the semi-final, he defeated Australian Nick Kyrgios in three tie-break sets to set up the final against Rafael Nadal. Federer won the match in two sets, capturing his third Sunshine Double, his fourth consecutive victory over Nadal, and his third Miami title but first since 2006. By doing so, he surpassed his previous record in Indian Wells as the oldest man ever to win a Master's 1000 event. Federer's ranking also improved to world No. 4. After his victory, he decided to take rest by skipping the entire clay court season including French Open which he initially planned to play but eventually decided to skip for the second consecutive year in order to prepare for the grass court season.\nGrass court season.\nStuttgart Open.\nIn his first tour match after winning the Miami final, Federer lost to Tommy Haas in the second round in three sets, having won the first set and held a match point in the second-set tiebreak. This was the first time since the 2002 Wimbledon championships that he had lost his opening match at a grass-court event.\nHalle Open.\nFederer defeated Yūichi Sugita, Mischa Zverev, Florian Mayer, and Karen Khachanov to reach the final without dropping a set. In the final he defeated Alexander Zverev, securing a record-extending ninth Halle title, and the third which he won without the loss of a set. This made him one of just two men in the Open Era, along with Rafael Nadal, to win the same tournament more than eight times. This title victory also saw Federer equal Nadal's all-time record of 18 ATP 500 titles won.\nWimbledon.\nDuring the first round, Federer advanced when his opponent, Alexandr Dolgopolov, withdrew mid-match due to injury. Still, Federer hit and surpassed the 10000 aces mark in his career during his shortened first round match. He then topped Dušan Lajović, Mischa Zverev, and Grigor Dimitrov, reaching an all-time record 15th Wimbledon quarter-final without the loss of a set. Against Milos Raonic whom he had lost to in last year's semifinal, Federer won the match in straight sets with a tiebreaker in the 3rd set to move onto his all-time record 12th Wimbledon semifinal, where he dispatched Tomáš Berdych in straight sets to advance to his 11th Wimbledon final, subsequently setting the record for the highest number of men's singles finals made at a single major. In the final, Federer defeated Marin Čilić in straight sets to win a record 8th Wimbledon Gentleman's singles title, breaking his previous tie with William Renshaw and Pete Sampras, and his 19th Grand Slam singles title overall. He became the second male player in the Open Era to win the championships without dropping a set, after Björn Borg in 1976. Following his victory, he also qualified for the 2017 ATP Finals for a record 15th time along with Rafael Nadal where he's won a record six titles.\nNorth American hard court season.\nCanadian Open.\nFederer announced that he would return to Montreal for the first time since 2011. Due to the absence of Andy Murray, he was seeded two behind Rafael Nadal, making this the first tournament since 2011 Monte-Carlo Masters where Nadal and Federer were the top two seeds. Federer started his campaign by beating Canadian Peter Polansky in straight sets in the second round. He went on to beat David Ferrer in the third round in 3 sets after recovering from a slow start, improving his career record against Ferrer to 17–0. However, his loss of the first set in that match broke his winning streak of 32 consecutive sets. He defeated Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in the quarterfinals in straight sets, improving to 7–0 against Bautista Agut. He defeated Dutchman Robin Haase in the semifinals to book his 6th final of the year. Federer suffered from a recurring back injury in the final, where he lost to Alexander Zverev in straight sets.\nCincinnati Masters.\nAfter losing the Montreal final, he traveled to Cincinnati only to pull out of the event due to a recurring back injury, missing a chance to return to No. 1.\nUS Open.\nFederer would make his return to New York after a back injury he suffered in Montreal. He was seeded third and drawn in the same half as Rafael Nadal, with both chasing the No.1 spot after the tournament. He faced American teenager Frances Tiafoe in the first round and defeated him in five sets; the first time he was taken to five sets in the opening round at the US Open since 2000. He went on to beat Russian Mikhail Youzhny by playing another five set match and improved to 17–0 in head-to-head matches. It is the first time in his career that he has played five-setters in both the first and second rounds of a major tournament. He easily dispatched Spaniard Feliciano López in the third round with a straight sets win to improve his record against him to 13–0. During his victory, Federer moved into second place in the all-time aces list surpassing Croatian Goran Ivanisevic's 10,131 tally. He went on to improve to 12–0 in head-to-head matches by beating German Philipp Kohlschreiber in straight sets to set up an encounter with Argentine Juan Martín del Potro in the quarterfinals, which he lost in 4 sets. After the encounter with del Potro, Federer reiterated that his back was healthy, but stated that he was \"not in a safe place\" going into the match and explained that his shot accuracy throughout the tournament had not been reliable enough.\nAsian swing.\nShanghai Masters.\nFederer began his campaign in Shanghai by defeating Diego Schwartzman, Alexandr Dolgopolov, and Richard Gasquet in straight sets.\nAfter prevailing in a 3-set semifinal match against Juan Martín del Potro, Federer defeated Rafael Nadal in the final in their fourth encounter of the season to equal Ivan Lendl for the second-most titles of the open era with 94. He beat his great rival for the fifth consecutive time, their 4 encounters in 2017 and the Basel 2015 Final. He also extended his own record as the oldest male player ever to win a Masters 1000 tournament. The win over Nadal was Federer's 350th match won at a Masters 1000 tournament.\nEuropean indoor hard court season.\nSwiss Indoors.\nUpon his return to Basel, Federer defeated Frances Tiafoe and Benoît Paire in straight sets. With this win Federer moved to the quarterfinals where he defeated Adrian Mannarino in three sets, then beat David Goffin in the semis to set up a final clash with Juan Martín del Potro. In the final Federer came from a set down, after losing a closely contested tiebreaker, to win in three sets. It was his 95th career title and his 8th in Basel.\nParis Masters.\nFederer was expected to play the Paris Masters, but withdrew before his first match citing a back injury.\nATP Finals.\nFederer qualified for the ATP finals as the second seed and won all three of his round-robin matches against Jack Sock, Alexander Zverev, and Marin Čilić. At the semifinals, he was defeated by David Goffin in three sets despite being a set up, ending his 2017 season.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Roger Federer in 2017, including walkovers (W/O) which the ATP does not count as wins or losses.\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nATP and Grand Slam sanctioned matches.\nRoger Federer has a ATP match win–loss record in the 2017 season.

        "text": "Cricketers who debuted for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in first-class cricket from the foundation of the club in 1787 until the end of the 1826 season are as follows. Many of the players continued to represent MCC after 1826 but they are only listed here, as it was in this period that they made their MCC debuts.\n1826 was effectively the last season in which underarm bowling prevailed; the so-called \"roundarm era\" began in 1827 with the roundarm trial matches. Furthermore, the major source for the period, the first volume of Arthur Haygarth's \"Scores &amp; Biographies\", ends in 1826 and his second volume (1827–1840) begins with the roundarm trials. All players in this list are sourced to either \"Scores &amp; Biographies\", Volume 1 (1744–1826) or Samuel Britcher's \"A list of all the principal Matches of Cricket that have been played (1790 to 1805)\" and \"not\" to any online source.\nDuring this period, MCC was the sport's predominant club with sole responsibility for the Laws of cricket and it was the main organiser of important matches. The club played a major role in cricket's long-term development by sustaining it through the Napoleonic Wars and providing the leadership needed to ensure its post-war recovery; during the Napoleonic Wars there was no formal county-based structure in cricket, let alone an international one, as in the two World Wars a century later. MCC played its home matches to 1826 at its three succeeding venues in London: Lord's \"Old Ground\" (1787–1810), Lord's \"Middle Ground\" (1811–1813) and the current Lord's from 1814. Although many of the players who represented the club were members or ground staff, others were associated with county clubs or teams and appeared for MCC by invitation. MCC teams have always operated at all levels of the sport and players who represented the club in minor cricket only are out of scope here (note, however, that the sources tend to treat the majority of MCC's senior matches to 1826 as important).\nThe details are the player's usual name followed by the span of years in which he was active as an MCC player in important matches (the span may include years in which he played in minor matches only for MCC and/or years in which he did not represent MCC in any matches) and then his name is given as it usually appeared on match scorecards (e.g., surname preceded by all initials). In cases where the player represented significant other teams besides MCC, these are given at the end of his entry."

        "title": "Michigan Wolverines women's ice hockey",
        "text": "The University of Michigan Women's Ice Hockey team represents the University of Michigan (U-M) in Women's Division 1 of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) and in the Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association (CCWHA). The team was founded in 1994 and has been consistently strong throughout its existence, winning a pair of CCWHA playoff titles (in a total of ten appearances in the league championship game) and qualifying for 13 of the 18 ACHA National Tournaments held for women's teams, a number that ranks third all-time behind Massachusetts and Michigan State.\nHistory.\nEarly Years (1994–2002).\nThe Wolverines were co-founded in 1994 by Sue McDowell, who has remained involved with the team in various capacities throughout its existence (although, emphasizing the difficulty of assembling early club hockey records, Michigan State has claimed that its 1995 founding makes it the oldest women's club hockey team in the state of Michigan). McDowell, a Massachusetts native, moved to Michigan in 1985 and took a job in U-M's IT department as a faculty liaison. She was dismayed at the lack of girls hockey in her new home state, leading to her starting the Wolverines' team and becoming heavily involved in local youth programs.\nIn 1996–97, the Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association was formed (notably pre-dating the women's hockey championships of both the ACHA and NCAA, as well as nearly every other women's college hockey conference), featuring Michigan as one of its charter members and the only team that has participated in each league season to date. The CCWHA provided an unprecedented level of organization and structure to an era when teams often filled out hodgepodge schedules with amateur adult teams and often did not have any sort of championship competition at the end of each season. The Wolverines, along with arch rival Ohio State, were among the most immediately successful teams in the CCWHA. At the inaugural 1997 CCWHA tournament, U-M swept a pool including Western Michigan, Bowling Green and Illinois, then beat Michigan State in the semi-finals, before losing to OSU for the championship. The Buckeyes would go on to win the first three CCWHA titles before moving to NCAA Division I in 1999 and becoming a varsity program.\nThat development would prove beneficial to the Wolverines, who would become the CCWHA's dominant team over the next couple seasons. In 2000–01, U-M smashed their way to a 24–1–1 regular season mark (including an unbeaten conference record, as the team's only defeat was to non-league opponent Arizona State) before defeating hosting Lake Superior State, Michigan State and Western Michigan en route to the CCWHA playoff title. There was plenty of credit to go around for the success: Meghan Collier was the team's leading scorer with 49 goals among her 67 points, Jackie Neal led the way with 24 assists, and goalies Dana Aronson and Christine Granger largely split duties, posting goals against averages of 0.94 and 1.19, respectively. Michigan was an inaugural member of the ACHA's first women's division (initially called the \"Women's Division,\" then \"Women's Division 1\" after a second women's division was added in 2006–07), which began play in that 2000–01 season and received the appropriate national spoils for a strong season. Collier became U-M's initial first team All-American, while the Wolverines received a bid to the ACHA National Tournament after finishing second in the ACHA's East Region (the team placed in the top spot for the first four periods before being edged out by Penn State in the fifth and final regular-season ranking).\nAt nationals, Michigan made history by participating in the opening game of the ACHA's first women's tournament, held in Wentzville, Missouri. Collier scored the first goal in tourney history, although the Wolverines had to settle for a tie with Colorado en route to a disappointing fifth-place finish, thanks largely to a 3–2 loss to Pittsburgh that saw U-M outshoot the Panthers 32–13.\nA Brief Struggle (2002–2004).\nAlthough it turned out to be a two-season blip relative to Michigan's typical success level, the Wolverines struggled during the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, a period that saw the departure of CCWHA-winning coach Hal Krenkel, and the one-year tenure of Steve Wartecker. In 2002–03, despite a strong first half and a fourth straight trip to the conference championship game (a 1–0 loss to Michigan State), the Wolverines dropped from second in the central region to third in the final ranking period to miss the tournament. Under the selection format used at the time, the top two teams in each region were picked for nationals, with two wild cards (generally, the third-ranked team in two of the three regions) rounding out a field of eight. However, for the 2003 tournament, Western Michigan (ranked below Michigan at fifth in the central) received a hosting autobid, limiting things to just one wild card, the west region's St. Cloud State.\nDespite the senior years of program legends like Collier and Neal, things went from near-miss to far-miss the following season. The 2003–04 schedule saw a disastrous 4–19–2 mark, with three of the four wins coming against a Notre Dame program that was a year away from going on hiatus.\nA Winters-Era Turnaround (2004–2008).\nMichigan's struggles would prove to be short-lived, thanks largely to new head coach Adam Winters (with Andrea Shear as co-coach during the first half of Winters' tenure) and a bevy of talented reinforcements. Players arriving at U-M in 2003 and 2004 included greats like Megan Lobeck, Lauren Lobert, Laine Schmid, Cheryl Mervich and Hillary Eagen. Jennifer Barnhart provided steady goaltending through the middle part of the decade, including being named the CCWHA's most valuable player in 2004–05, a season that saw her play every minute in the maize and blue crease.\nIn 2004–05, U-M got off to an inauspicious 1–6–1 start thanks in part to a tough schedule including Michigan State and Western Michigan, but the team's fortunes turned on a dime in early November and the Wolverines would only lose a pair of games through the remainder of the regular season, both to a powerful Northern Michigan team that would go on to the ACHA National Tournament. Key victories in the stretch included a 2–1 overtime result over Penn State on Darcy Utter's winner as well as the 6–0 win over Oakland that began the turnaround and featured two goals each from Schmid, Utter and Stacey Moses. At the end of the year, and following another CCWHA playoff run to the title game, Michigan ranked 11th nationally, but was initially bumped from the now-12-team field thanks once again to autobids – this time a host bid given to Buffalo (which was unranked) and another given to the University of Pennsylvania (ranked 14th) for winning the southeast region title. However, Penn declined their bid, allowing the Wolverines to sneak into nationals for the first time since 2002, although the trip ended quickly following losses to Massachusetts, Lindenwood and NMU. Still, Michigan's standard had been reset, and 2005 turned out to be the first of five straight trips to nationals, and 11 in 12 years through the 2015–16 season.\nSubsequent seasons saw a lot of the same, as U-M finished second during the CCWHA regular season in three straight years from 2005–06 through 2006–08, and won exactly 18 games while playing for the CCWHA title in 2004–05, 2005–06 and 2007–08 (Michigan's ten appearances in the league championship game are a record, solidly ahead of Michigan State's seven, although the Wolverines have gone 2–8–0 in those contests). In 2008, U-M defeated MSU in the CCWHA playoff semifinals in dramatic fashion, with goaltender Maggie Wagner holding the Spartans to a single goal through the overtime period and stopping 4 of 5 shots in the shootout round to claim victory. In both 2005–06 and 2007–08, U-M advanced out of the pool round of the ACHA National Tournament but were defeated in the quarterfinals by, respectively, Rhode Island and Robert Morris (IL), two of the ACHA's powerhouses of the era. In 2007–08, Michigan finished with three All-Americans (Amy Cauzillo on the second team, Lauren Lobert and Maggie Wagner as honorable mentions) although Emily Nelson's arrival that year, which included a 23-goal freshman season, signaled a passing of the baton to the next generation of stars.\nBlackburn Keeps The Beat Going (2008–2015).\nIn 2008–09, Rob Blackburn took over as head coach and his seven seasons in charge were marked by continuing success, as he led U-M to five winning records, six ACHA National Tournament appearances, and a pair of CCWHA championship games. As he began, much of the group that had fueled the Wolverines' mid-decade turnaround had moved on, but the squad quickly reloaded with players like Kristin Griebe, who arrived in 2009 and would go on to become Michigan's all-time leading scorer (in documented seasons) with 90 goals and 73 assists in 116 games. Beyond the point total, Griebe also achieved rarefied status in the accolade department, as she led U-M to a 19–8–4 mark (the team's best win total since 2001–02) and earned the school's second spot on the ACHA's All-American First Team, following Collier in 2000–01.\nBlackburn proved adept as a recruiter, particularly in landing players who had begun their collegiate careers in NCAA Division III like Charlotte Hotaling (Manhattanville) and Monica Korzon (Plattsburgh State). Both Hotaling and Korzon arrived in Ann Arbor in 2011 and would be significant pieces of the team's core over the next couple years.\nOne of Michigan's best seasons came in 2014–15, a campaign that saw the Wolverines close the regular season with their highest-ever ACHA national ranking, third. A well-balanced squad featuring Jenna Trubiano, Kalli Bates, Jennifer Cusmano, Mercedes Reyes, Karrie Inman and Erin Gregoire made a spirited CCWHA tournament run that included overtime wins against eventual ACHA semifinalists Adrian (thanks to Trubiano's winner) and Grand Valley State (with Jessica Buckley the hero that time) before falling in the final to defending national champion Miami. Although the Wolverines ultimately bowed out of nationals in the pool round, it wasn't before one of the most stirring wins in recent program history. On March 5, 2015, in York, Pennsylvania, U-M trailed Minnesota 3–1 midway through the third period. Bates, with her team facing elimination, willed the game back by scoring twice in a 2:24 span to force overtime, where Gregoire cashed in a power play for the victory. However, that triumph would be one of only three ACHA nationals wins of the Blackburn era (one of which came post-elimination in 2013), against 15 losses.\nRecent Seasons (2015–present).\nAfter Blackburn's departure following 2014–15, program founder McDowell stepped into the head coaching role and was then joined by Terry Mathews for one season. The result in 2015–16 was a somewhat uneven year epitomized by a pair of early upsets. The first, on October 4, 2015, saw an unheralded Davenport team undo 2–0 and 3–2 Michigan leads to win 4–3 behind Lexie Boydston's three-point morning, including a shorthanded game-winning goal for the Panthers' first-ever victory against their cross-state rivals. A more encouraging outcome for the Wolverines came just four days later when U-M toppled third-ranked Adrian on the road and in overtime. With Michigan trailing 2–1 in the game's dying moments, Cusmano pushed home a rebound with just one second showing on the clock to force the extra period. Then, 19 seconds from a tie, Sarah Lather potted the winner in support of Bailey Hamill's 31 saves.\nGoal scoring would rarely prove that timely for most of the year though, as Michigan only managed 61 over 25 ACHA games, 2.4 per contest. The efforts of Cusmano, Reyes and Inman (who combined for 29 goals of the 61) along with strong goaltending from Hamill and Julia Chenoweth, did wind up being just enough to push the Wolverines to their 13th nationals bid. However, thanks in part to Trubiano's long-term injury and an upset loss to Robert Morris at the CCWHA playoffs, U-M finished ninth in the ACHA rankings in 2016–17 to miss ACHAs for the first time since 2009–10. One season highlight came on February 18, 2017, when the Wolverines spoiled the senior night of eventual national champion Miami and the celebration of a class that would end up with the 2014, 2016 and 2017 ACHA titles, the 2014, 2015 and 2017 CCWHA titles, along with a host of individual honors. Nevertheless, goals by Camilla Vercollone, Rachel Hysong and Inman staked Michigan to an early 3–0 lead, and although the RedHawks rallied to force overtime, Reyes found a maize and blue winner there.\nPotential NCAA Status and Criticism.\nThe state of Michigan is notable for the fact that despite ranking fourth among the U.S. states in the total number of female players, it does not have a single NCAA Division I women's program. Because of this, and thanks largely to the historic success of the university's famed NCAA Division I men's program, U-M has often been the subject of speculation (and sometimes, criticism) concerning varsity status for women's hockey. The closest women's hockey came to becoming an NCAA program was early in the team's existence when, in 1997, the university considered the possibility but decided to make two other sports—women's soccer and women's water polo—varsity sports instead, citing the expense of women's hockey as the rationale for the decision. Another bid occurred in 2011, but U-M again declined women's hockey, this time in favor of women's lacrosse. In 2014, former Wolverines athletic director Dave Brandon said that financial considerations remain the primary obstacle for NCAA women's hockey at the school. Among the major expenses would be the construction of a new ice facility to supplement the single-sheet Yost Ice Arena and help meet that level's demands for available ice time and locker space.\nGiven the aforementioned realities concerning U-M's and the state of Michigan's stature in the hockey world, as well as the lack of NCAA Division I women's programs in the state, the school is often held up as a symbol of women's hockey growth struggles. On May 6, 2017, the \"New York Times\" published an article spotlighting the differences between U-M's top men's and women's hockey teams. The piece, most notably, cited the fact that the team receives none of its budget directly from the university's athletic department while requiring team members to pay $1600 each season to play. Players also conduct numerous fundraisers to meet expenses, including selling t-shirt, soliciting sponsorship money from local businesses and occasionally sweeping up the Crisler Center after U-M men's basketball games to defray expenses including travel, an annual ice bill of $20,000 from Yost Ice Arena and a $3000 stipend paid to the squad's head coach (contrasted with the $238,702 former men's coach Red Berenson made in 2014). Beyond financial concerns, the team does not have a permanent locker facility at their cramped, nearly-century-old rink, and even requests for more feasible space, like a display case, have been denied.\nSeason by Season Results.\nSources:\nProgram records.\nAs of May 9, 2017.

A preseason ranking was initiated beginning with 2014–15. Beginning with the 2016–17 season, the ACHA tabulated rankings each week during the season and issued them on Tuesdays following weekends including games.\nRegional rankings.\nFrom 2000–01 through 2002–03, regional rankings were the sole method for determining ACHA National Tournament bids. The inaugural 2000–01 season featured teams divided into East and West Regions (Michigan was sorted into the East), with the top four from each in February's final ranking invited to nationals. For 2001–02 and 2002–03, the setup was expanded to include East, Central and West Regions, with U-M moved to the Central Region that it would occupy through 2009–10. Under that system, the top two from each region were invited to nationals, along with two wild card teams. In 2003–04, the tournament field was expanded to 12 teams, and a national ranking was introduced. The latter development diminished the importance of the regional rankings, as the national rankings were used to determine nationals bids. Regional champions were still awarded an autobid, however, even if ranked outside of the top 12 nationally. In 2004–05, growth in the number of ACHA women's teams resulted in an increase to four regions – Northeast, Southeast, Central and West – although things reverted to East, Central and West in 2007–08. The 2009–10 season was notable both for the fact that the tournament field was reduced back to eight teams and as the final year of the regional system, which had become largely antiquated as regional champions generally had little issue placing highly in the national rankings.\nACHA national honors.\nAnnual Awards.\nAll-Americans and All-Tournament selections including all seasons except 2008–09.

Emily Nelson represented U-M on the 2011 squad, the first women's team USA Hockey sent to the tournament, and potted a pair of goals for the fourth-place finishers, both in a rout of host team Turkey. In 2013, the selections expanded to include then-head coach Rob Blackburn (as an assistant on the US staff), along with Monica Korzon, Kristin Griebe and Kalli Bates. Those Wolverines were part of a history-making squad that became the first Americans to medal at WUG in the modern era and using ACHA players (a period that began in 2001 on the men's side). Korzon scored twice during the event, and while one (assisted by Bates) came late in a blowout of Spain, the other was the opening goal in the bronze medal game, a 3–1 win over Japan. Another key win by Team USA in 2013 was a tourney-opening 4–2 victory over a Russian squad featuring several players who have been members of the senior Russia women's national ice hockey team.\nIn 2015, Korzon became the first (and, to date, only) Wolverine to be picked for WUG a second time, and she captained Team USA to a fifth-place finish while lodging a trio of assists in a consolation-round-clinching victory over Spain, with stateside teammate Eleanor Chalifoux scoring in the game.\nRivalries.\nMichigan State.\nWhen two of the pre-eminent, most successful and groundbreaking (given that both began life in the mid-1990s, making them well-aged by women's college hockey standards) programs in non-varsity women's hockey are located 65 miles apart from each other and already enjoy a healthy and ongoing feud in other sports (notably including men's hockey), a rivalry is more or less a foregone conclusion.\nMichigan and Michigan State are two of the ACHA's top three schools in all-time national tournament appearances (13 and 14, respectively), although MSU has twice claimed the national championship that has proven elusive for the Wolverines. U-M has faced the Spartans twice at nationals, with both ending in MSU overtime wins. The more recent of the pair came in 2014 with both teams already eliminated from advancement out of the pool stage, while 2002's fifth-place game saw an Andrea Deshong winner. The teams have also met twice with the CCWHA title on the line. Third-period goals by Mindy McCarthy and Susan Schutter delivered the 2002 crown to the Spartans, who then repeated with a 1–0 victory the next year.\nThe series was hindered for a brief time beginning in 2004–05 when Michigan State pulled its top team (then called the Green team) out of the CCWHA to play an independent schedule while placing its second team (then called the White team) in its spot. MSU White was generally far less of a factor in the league, as evidenced by U-M's 10–0–0 record and aggregate 61–4 scoreline against that squad over its two CCWHA seasons (Michigan did continue to schedule MSU Green as well during this period, although meetings were more intermittent). In 2007–08, the Spartans A team re-joined the CCWHA and remains in the conference today. U-M and MSU were well matched all that season, culminating in a thrilling Wolverines shootout victory over the Spartans in the CCWHA semifinals.\nOn December 6, 2010, Michigan and Michigan State played an outdoor game at Michigan Stadium, U-M's football venue. The contest, won 4–3 by the Spartans, was part of the festivities leading up to The Big Chill at the Big House between the schools' men's NCAA Division I hockey teams. Another wrinkle enhancing the rivalry relates to former U-M coach Rob Blackburn, who accepted the head coaching position with the Spartans in 2015–16, immediately following his departure from Michigan.\nIn 2016–17, Michigan and Michigan State split two scheduled games, with the Wolverines win coming on a Mercedes Reyes overtime goal on February 11, 2017.\nOhio State.\nA natural rivalry thanks to existing antipathy between the two universities (due mostly to the well-known football rivalry between the schools), the Michigan–Ohio State series in women's hockey has nevertheless been marked largely by inconsistency interrupted with occasional bursts of heat. OSU won the first three CCWHA playoff titles, defeating the Wolverines in the final of the inaugural 1996–97 season, but the rivalry went on hiatus for a few years immediately following the 1998–99 season when the Buckeyes moved their team to NCAA Division I. Ohio State rejoined the CCWHA (and joined the ACHA, which did not exist for women's hockey in 1999) with a separate team in 2004–05, and in the several seasons that followed, the rivalry enjoyed some of its best years. The Buckeyes were the 2006–07 CCWHA champions (which involved a win over U-M at the league tournament), while the Wolverines returned the favor two years later with an overtime win at the 2009 ACHA National Tournament, the only time the teams have met at nationals. However, Ohio State has not defeated Michigan since the 2011–12 season as the balance of the series has lately tilted heavily in the maize and blue direction.\nWestern Michigan.\nThe series between Michigan and the Kalamazoo, MI-based opponent has been dormant since WMU disbanded its team in 2012. But, for a time, Michigan–Western Michigan games defined the CCWHA race in a way that not even the better-known Michigan State and Ohio State rivalries could match. From 1997 through 2008, the two schools combined for a whopping 14 appearances in the league title game (of 24 total spots available over the 12-year run). They went head to head for the trophy on four occasions: Michigan defeated WMU for both of its titles in 2000 and 2001, while the Broncos returned the favor while winning their only titles in 2005 and 2006. In all situations, the teams met 14 documented times in the CCWHA playoffs, with the Wolverines holding a 9–5–0 advantage. One demonstration of the evenly-matched nature of the opponents was that prior to each of the three documented championship game meetings (2001, 2005 and 2006), the eventual losing team in the final defeated the eventual champion during the round robin stage of the tournament. Western Michigan, like U-M, enjoyed status on the national scene and qualified for five straight ACHA National Tournaments from 2004 through 2008. WMU took the only head-to-head meeting there however, a 6–1 decision in 2007 with both squads already eliminated from title contention.\nPlayers.\nCurrent Roster.\nAs of the 2023–24 season."

He was selected as the most valuable player on the Valley Forge football team in 1945.\nCarr signed with the San Francisco 49ers in 1947. At the time, he was reported to be 19 or 20 years old, though databases indicate that he was actually 24 years old in the fall of 1947. He played at the halfback position for the 49ers from 1947 to 1949, appearing in a total of 30 AAFC games, three as a starter. He totaled 283 rushing yards and 246 receiving yards, intercepted 14 passes, and scored nine touchdowns.\nDuring the 1949 season, Carr sustained a severe leg injury.

        "text": "Jorge Alves (pronounced \"George Ahlves\"; born January 30, 1979) is an American equipment manager for the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is best known for playing goaltender for the Hurricanes at the very end of one game during the 2016–17 season. With a total career playing time of 7.6 seconds, Alves' career is the shortest in NHL history.\nEarly life.\nAlves was born in Stoughton, Massachusetts, a twin brother in a Portuguese-American family. He began playing ice hockey at 14 or 15 years old, not having been able to afford it previously. He graduated from Stoughton High School where he played goaltender on the school's hockey team.\nHe served in the United States Marine Corps from 1997 to 2001. While he was in boot camp, his parents withheld offer letters from junior and college hockey teams, fearing that he would regret his decision to enlist. Alves then attended North Carolina State University, where he was the Wolfpack club's starting goaltender.\nProfessional career.\nAlves played professional hockey for the Greenville Grrrowl, South Carolina Stingrays, Charlotte Checkers and Pensacola Ice Pilots of the ECHL and Asheville Aces of the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL). He played nine games across the two leagues between 2004 and 2007.\nDuring the 2003–04 season, Alves was hired as an assistant equipment manager of the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL). He became a full-time equipment manager for the team during the 2012–13 season.\nAlves gained significant attention on December 31, 2016, when he signed a professional try-out contract to serve as a backup goaltender for the Hurricanes in their game later that day, due to the illness of Eddie Läck, who had suffered a concussion. While serving as backup, Alves engaged in his regular duties as equipment manager, such as sharpening skates and taping sticks. With the Hurricanes losing 3–1 to the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Lightning having iced the puck at the end of the game, Hurricanes' coach Bill Peters put Alves in the net in place of starting goalie Cam Ward for the final seconds of the match. He faced no shots in his debut. At age 37, Alves became one of the oldest players in NHL history to make their debut, and with 7.6 seconds of action, Alves achieved the second shortest debut in league history, behind Kellan Lain, who recorded a two-second debut in 2014. Additionally, Alves set records for both the shortest debut by a goaltender and shortest NHL career, surpassing both Robbie Irons and Christian Soucy, who each played for three minutes in their NHL careers.\nPersonal life.\nAlves speaks Portuguese. He has two children with his wife, Amanda. Alves met his wife at a nightclub in Raleigh, North Carolina which would later become the site of a Hurricanes practice facility."

It is located at the Port of Redwood City along Redwood creek in Redwood City, California. \nHistory.\nThe Stanford Rowing and Sailing Center has a long history dating back to 1905 when undergraduates at the university saw a need for a boathouse for intercollegiate competition. The first boathouse was constructed along Redwood Creek and remained active for the next 10 years there.\nIn 1913, another boathouse was built on campus on the edge of Lake Lagunita for Freshmen, spring practice, and campus recreation. Due to the onset of the World War I, rowing dwindled in popularity and revenues fell from sporting events; there was no longer any way to financially support the rowing team.\nIn 1929, the student body voted to reinstate crew as a sport and acquiring boats and shells with which to compete. In 1940 the Cardinal Crew made a comeback once again and with a new boathouse at the Redwood City Harbor. However, once again, the onset of war (this time World War II) brought the end of rowing, and the new boathouse was locked up. Use of the boathouse only resumed in 1947.\nModern day.\nIn 2004, there was resistance from homeowners in Redwood Shores to having Stanford boats stored near their properties. This in part spurred forward the building of the current center which still stands today.\nThe modern Stanford Rowing and Sailing Center is located alongside Redwood Creek in Redwood City and was built in 2003 to replace older facilities. It is a boathouse that cost to build. The building was designed by Hoover Associates and contains accommodation for both men's and women's crew and sailing with a second level with locker areas, exercise facilities, and a large function room. The center also hosts many youth rowing and sailing groups, often sharing dock and launch space with the nearby Marine Science Institute."

        "text": "The Kennedy Town Swimming Pool () is a public swimming complex in Kennedy Town, Hong Kong. There have been two pools of this name. The first iteration opened in 1974 while the current iteration opened in 2011.\nFirst generation.\nConstruction of the Kennedy Town Swimming Pool began in 1971 on the former site of the Kennedy Town cattle quarantine depot on Smithfield. The $7.5 million facility was funded by the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club and opened on 14 August 1974. At the opening ceremony, Jockey Club steward Douglas Laing unveiled a commemorative plaque. The pool was built and managed by the Urban Council and was the first public pool in Western District. The complex comprised two 50 metre pools, a diving pool, a spectator stand as well as smaller children's pools.\nThe West Island line, a scheme to extend the Island line railway line to Western District, was gazetted in October 2007 and given final authorisation in March 2009. It was decided to build the terminus of the line, Kennedy Town station, at Smithfield, necessitating the demolition of the swimming pool.\nSecond generation.\nThe new swimming pool complex occupies a 0.8 ha site near the Kennedy Town waterfront. It was designed by architecture firm Farrells, built by Paul Y. Engineering, and cost an estimated HK$671 million. The complex includes two 50 metres pools, a 25-metre training pool, a children's pool and a jacuzzi. The futuristic pool building is clad in zinc, while a translucent insulated membrane roofing system allows diffuse natural light to reach the indoor pool hall.\nComprising the outdoor pools only, the first phase of the new complex opened on 11 May 2011.\nThe second phase of the swimming pool, comprising the indoor pools, was completed in 2016 and opened to the public on 7 February 2017."
