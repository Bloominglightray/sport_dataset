        "text": "The 2021–22 Rugby Pro D2 was the second-level French rugby union club competition, below the Top 14, for the 2021–22 season. It will run alongside the 2021–22 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nCompetition format.\nThe regular season uses a double round-robin format, in which each team plays the others home and away.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nStarting with the 2017–18 season, Pro D2 conducts a play-off system identical to the one currently used in Top 14, with the top six teams qualifying for the play-offs and the top two teams receiving byes into the semi-finals. The winner of the play-offs earns the league championship and automatic promotion to the next season's Top 14; the runner-up enters a play-off with the second-from-bottom Top 14 team, with the winner of that play-off taking up the final place in Top 14.\nThis replaced the previous system in which the top team at the end of the regular season was declared champion, also earning a Top 14 place, while the second- through fifth-place teams competed in promotion play-offs. The play-off semi-finals were played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final was then played on neutral ground, and the winner earned the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nPromotion.\nPro D2 to Top 14.\nAs noted above, both promotion places will be determined by play-offs from 2017–18 forward, with the winner of the Pro D2 play-offs earning promotion and the runner-up playing the second-from-bottom Top 14 team for the next season's final Top 14 place.\nNationale to Pro D2.\nStarting with the 2021–22 season, the FFR created a third professional league, slotting between Pro D2 and Fédérale 1 in the league system called Nationale.\nRelegation.\nNormally, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to Nationale at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher-placed team to be demoted instead, or bar a Fédérale 1 team from promotion."

        "text": "Short track speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics are scheduled to be held at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing, China. The events are scheduled to take place between 5 and 16 February 2022. A total of nine short track speed skating events will be held.\nIn July 2018, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially added the mixed relay held over a distance of 2000 metres, increasing the total number of events to nine. Due to the addition of the event, the competition schedule was increased to six days from five.\nA total of 112 quota spots (56 per gender) were distributed to the sport, a decline of eight from the 2018 Winter Olympics. A total of nine events were contested, four for men, four for women and one mixed. \nQualification.\nA total quota of 112 athletes are scheduled to compete (56 men and 56 women). Countries were assigned quotas using the results of the entire 2020–21 World Cup in the autumn of 2021. Each nation was permitted to enter a maximum of five athletes per gender if it qualified a relay team and three if it did not. There were a maximum of thirty-two qualifiers for the 500m and 1000m events; thirty-six for the 1500m events; eight for the single gender relays, and 12 for the mixed relay. At the end of qualification, the International Skating Union confirmed 58 men and 54 women earned quota spots, which meant two quota spots were transferred from women to men.\nCompetition schedule.\nThe following was the competition schedule for all nine events. Sessions that included the event finals are shown in bold.\nMedal summary.\nMixed event.\n Skaters who did not participate in the final, but received medals.\nRecords.\nWorld records (WR) and Olympic records (OR) set during the competition.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 112 athletes from 22 nations (including the IOC's designation of ROC for the Russian Olympic Committee) qualified to participate. Turkey made its debut in the sport at these Winter Olympics.\n\"The numbers in parentheses represents the number of participants entered.\"\nControversy.\nThe Men's 1000 meters event was marred by controversy. During the semifinals, Hwang Dae-heon of South Korea was disqualified for an \"illegal late pass causing contact\", and Lee June-seo of South Korea were penalized for a lane change that caused contact, allowing Li Wenlong from China to qualify for the A final joining two countrymen. Then, after the conclusion of the A final, Shaolin Sandor Liu of Hungary was disqualified for a \"straight lane change from inside to out causing contact” and an “arm block at the finish\", resulting in Ren Ziwei and Li from China being awarded the gold and silver medals respectively The International Skating Union received and rejected two protests from Hungary and South Korea on February 7, 2022. The International Skating Union stated that they reviewed the incident with the Video Referee and rejected the protests, standing by the original decisions made by the Chief Referee. \nAustralian former Olympic gold medalist Steven Bradbury said, \"nothing could be more favorable for the Chinese team with the judges than what’s happened tonight here in Beijing\". While Stephen Gough, head coach of the U.S. team, stated that he did not believe that the Chinese team should have been penalized.\nHowever, the Korean Sport &amp; Olympic Committee later filed an official appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport over the disqualification of two of the South Korean athletes from the men's 1000 metres speedskating event semifinals.\nDuring the 5000 metres relay event, in the semifinals of the event, the Chinese team fell with 10 laps to go. There was no obvious obstruction on the Chinese skater, but they were advanced to the A final, with no team disqualified during the race. The Chinese team were advanced, even though they finished last in the race and there was no impeding action on the team."

        "text": "The following is about the qualification rules and the quota allocation for the short track speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nQualification rules.\nA total quota of 112 athletes are allowed to compete at the Games (56 men and 56 women). Countries are assigned quotas based on their performance during the 2021–22 ISU Short Track Speed Skating World Cup. Each nation is permitted to enter a maximum of four athletes per gender if it qualified a relay team and three if it did not. If, in a specific gender, the NOC has qualified eight individual starting places (i.e. 3 in the 500m, 3 in the 1000m, 2 in the 1500m) then they are allowed a maximum of five. Hosts China are guaranteed a quota of one entry per race for a total of eight athletes. There are a maximum of thirty-two qualifiers for the 500m and 1000m events; thirty-six for the 1500m events; eight for the men's and women's relays; and twelve for the mixed relay.\nAdditional quota's for the mixed team relay.\nIf there are not twelve NOCs with both two male and two female quotas, and if the maximum allocation limit of 112 has not been reached, then NOCs may receive a maximum of one quota to become eligible for this race. These quotas will be given out in order of the NOCs ranking in the world cup standings until there are twelve qualified teams.\nAllocation of remaining quotas.\nIf the maximum of 112 has not been reached after fulfilling all the above qualification than the remaining quotas will be distributed to NOCs qualified in a relay event that have also qualified seven individual starting places in that specific gender. Following that, if there is still remaining quotas, they will be available to any nation that has qualified four athletes in a gender, with priority given to the rankings in the relay standings.\nQuota allocation.\nThe ISU announced the complete breakdown of allocations on 9 December 2021, and the final list after reallocations on January 24, 2022.\nRelays.\nNations could compete in four world cup races, and are ranked by their three best scores. The top eight men's and women's teams qualify while the top twelve mixed teams qualify.\nFinal standings\nIndividual distances.\nThe first placed racer (per NOC) is ranked based on the three best world cup results, out of four, for each race. This means that multiple skaters could have a part in that ranking. The second and third best were ranked in the same way. For the 500m and 1000m the top 32 qualify, and for the 1500m the top 36 qualify. The next best six nations for each race are shown.\nFinal standings after four of four races."

It was run on November 6, 2021 at Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California. It proved decisive in American Horse of the Year voting as it featured the top-ranked older horse Knicks Go and the leading three-year-olds, Essential Quality and Medina Spirit. The race was won by Knicks Go.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). The purse of $6,000,000 was the highest in North America in 2021. The race is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nThe race was broadcast on NBC.\nContenders.\nThe Breeders' Cup Classic is open to up to 14 starters, with automatic berths for horses that win one of the designated \"Win and You're In\" races in the 2021 Breeders' Cup Challenge series. Other horses are ranked by their performances in graded stakes races and by the judgement of a panel of racing experts.\nEntries were taken on November 1, after which the post position draw was held. The leading contenders were:\nThe mare Letruska, who had won five straight races including four at the Grade I level, was the only Horse of the Year candidate not entered in the race, instead running in the Breeders' Cup Distaff.\nRace description.\nEssential Quality went off as the post-time favorite, in part because bettors expected a speed duel to develop between Medina Spirit and Knicks Go, who both favored a front-running style. Instead Medina Spirit broke slowly and Knicks Go got off to an early lead. After running a fast opening half-mile in 45.77 seconds, Knicks Go was able to relax down the backstretch. Moving around the final turn, Hot Rod Charlie mounted a drive and closed to within a length at the top of the stretch. Knicks Go then responded by drawing away down the stretch to win by lengths over Medina Spirit, with Essential Quality closing for third. The final time was an excellent 1:59.57.\nKnicks Go became the sixth horse to win two different Breeders' Cup races, having won the Dirt Mile in 2020. It was the first Breeders' Cup Classic win for trainer Brad Cox, and gave him wins in three of the four majors. \"Obviously, the race went really well\", said Cox. \"He broke and was able to establish position early. Once he was able to do that, he's a hard horse to catch.\"\nKnicks Go was subsequently named the 2021 American Horse of the Year, receiving 228 of 235 votes.\nResults.\nTimes: – 23.16; – 45.77; – 1:10.04; mile – 1:35.28; final – 1:59.57&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (23.16) (22.61) (24.27) (25.24) (24.29)\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

The Tigers represented the Princeton University and played their home games at the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink, and were coached by Ron Fogarty, in his 7th season.\nSeason.\nAfter losing all of their previous season to the COVID-19 pandemic, Princeton started the year well, posting a winning record through their third week. Afterwards, the team's goaltending faltered and the Tigers lost nine consecutive games, dropping them to the bottom of the conference standings.\nAround Christmas, Princeton was one of several teams affected by an uptick in COVID positives that forced the team to postpone several games until later in the season. At one point, Princeton was prepared to use Rachel McQuigge, the starting goalie for the women's team, as a backup but the game in question was delayed and the idea was never put into practice. The delay did allow the team to refocus for the second half of the season and the Tigers reeled off several wins to climb up into the middle of the ECAC pack.\nSenior Jérémie Forget took command of the Princeton crease by February, however, an injury knocked him out for the remainder of the regular season. Aidan Porter was installed in goal for the six games that had been shoehorned into the final two weeks and Princeton ended up losing each match. While the defense wasn't able to keep the puck out of the net, the offense had also regressed, getting shut out in three of those games.\nPrinceton got its starting goalie back in time for the postseason, but Forget had little time to get back into the swing of things. The Tigers allowed Union to shell their net, allowing 37 shots against in both games. Forget held the fort in the first contest, allowing 3 goals, but the offense remained diminished and Princeton was swept out of the playoffs.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "Ghost Golf",
        "text": "Ghost Golf is a humorous horror-themed indoor miniature golf course and arcade located on North Blackstone Avenue in Fresno, California.\nHistory and description.\nGhost Golf was originally a Halloween-inspired display set up in the front yard of the private residence of Daryn Coleman. Tired of having his \"one day of glory\" a year, he opened a 9-hole course in nearby Concord, California in 2010 on Salvio Street. Approximately four years later, they relocated to a larger 18-hole course in a former Hollywood Video on Clayton Road in Concord, adding a private party room and mummy shooting gallery. The location featured multiple animatronics along the course, including wise-cracking skeletons, a possessed voodoo doll, and a singing skeleton band that performed \"Skeletons in my Closet\" by The Fat Man and Team Fat. \nAlthough someone started a petition supporting Ghost Golf, their location closed in early 2018 to make room for a flagship Dunkin' Donuts location and two other retail spaces after the landlord raised the rent. The business then re-opened in a larger 10,000-square-foot location, formerly home to No Surrender Lazer Tag, in Fresno near Whitie's Pets on October 22, 2018. They retained the animatronics and graveyard designs from their first two locations while adding an additional party room. \nLawsuit.\nOn October 30, 2020, it was reported that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in California, Ghost Golf had shut down in March of that year and reopened two months later in June after being given the all-clear by Fresno County. However, they were only open four days before the business was closed again, this time due to Governor Gavin Newsom's pandemic response. According to Coleman, this has cost him $23,000 to $25,000 per month plus rent and other business expenses. Furthermore, Newsom's restrictions abruptly halted his additional plans to open an escape room due to insufficient funds. As a result, Coleman filed a lawsuit against Newsom on October 26, 2020. They were later allowed to re-open at limited capacity in early April 2021 when Fresno County moved to the yellow tier, just over a year since their initial closure in March 2020."

        "text": "General Israel Putnam, also known as Putnam's Escape at Horseneck, is an equestrian statue at the Putnam Memorial State Park in Redding, Connecticut, United States. The statue was designed by sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington and dedicated in 1969 in honor of Connecticut native Israel Putnam, a military officer who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.\nHistory.\nIsrael Putnam was a military officer who served as a major general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Putnam became a well-known historical figure for his actions during the war, which included leading troops at the Battle of Bunker Hill. In 1779, while in Greenwich, Connecticut, the 60-year-old Putnam was spotted by British troops, who proceeded to chase him on horseback. In one of his most well-known escapades, Putnam managed to escape capture by riding his horse down a notably steep hill that was considered unsafe for horse-riding.\nMore than a century later, this story inspired sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington to create an equestrian statue memorializing the event. Huntington, who was born in 1876, was an American sculptor from the Boston area who was recognized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art as one of the preeminent female sculptors in the country and had studied the craft at the Art Students League of New York in the early 1900s. For some time, Huntington had lived in Redding, Connecticut, near the Putnam Memorial State Park, which had served as Putnam's winter encampment during the war. Huntington was especially renowned for her equestrian statues, with some of her more notable works including an equestrian statue of Joan of Arc in New York City and \"El Cid Campeador\".\nWorking on the Putnam sculpture in 1966 at the age of 90, it would be the last of seven major equestrian statues she had created during her career, as well as one of the last works created before her death in 1973. Completed in 1967, the sculpture was donated to the Putnam Memorial State Park in 1969. It was dedicated on September 21, 1969, near the entrance of the park, with Albert D. Putnam, a descendant of Israel, giving the main speech at the ceremony, during which he stated that his ancestor had \"rode down the hill to everlasting fame and into the heart of Mrs. Huntington\". Another speech was given by Donald C. Matthews, Director of the Connecticut State Park and Forest Commission, who said: \"We are here to honor two great citizens, General Israel Putnam and Mrs. Huntington, the most remarkable woman I have ever known.\"\nIn 1994, the monument was surveyed as part of the Save Outdoor Sculpture! project.\nDesign.\nThe bronze sculpture measures tall and has side measurements of and . It stands on a rectangular fieldstone pedestal that is tall with side measurements of and . The sculpture depicts Putnam on horseback descending a flight of stairs, holding the reins in his left hand. His body is partially turned backwards and he is looking up and shaking his right fist in defiance. The horse's head is turned to the left and bears a terrified expression. The base of the sculpture bears some small inscriptions from the sculptor (ANNA H. HUNTINGTON / 1967 / STANERIGG), while a bronze plaque affixed to the pedestal bears the following inscription:"

The teams was coached by Bud Boeringer in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nIn the first season for the Big Red without Nick Bawlf in 32 years, the team had a dismal performance. The hope for the season was quickly quashed in the first game when Army trounced the nearly all-sophomore Cornell squad to the tune of 0–9. The team didn't get much better as the year went on; after a second shutout loss the following weekend, Cornell had to wait on the sideline for four weeks before they were able to play their third match.\nThe team, as it had since 1942, could only manage 4 contests on the year. For the third time in four years, they lost every one. To make matters worse, they weren't even competitive in any of their games, with the closest score being 2–10. The lack of practice time due to still using Lake Beebe as their primary surface was just too great an obstacle to overcome. This was also the first year that the NCAA sponsored ice hockey, which meant that the sport was becoming much more than just a fad for some schools.\nAfter the year, with no chance to improve the program's fortunes on the horizon, Cornell decided to shelve the ice hockey team. In the decade afterwards, the flame for the program was kept alive long enough for the school to secure funding for the first on-campus rink. Completed in 1957, the Lynah Rink enable Cornell to return to the ice and keep the tradition alive for the Big Red.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2020 Horse racing doping scam was revealed in March 2020, when the FBI cracked down several top names in horse racing. Initially, 27 people (trainers and veterinarians) were charged with doping, which later increased to 29 people.\nAmong the accused were the horse trainer Jason Servis, as well as the harness trainer Chris Oakes, who trained the world record champion Homicide Hunter. The FBI engaged in reconnaissance and telephone tapping for a long time, which helped prosecutors decide to prosecute. According to information, three horses in trainer Rene Allard's stable have died after ingesting illicit doping substances, and horses in Jorge Navarro's stable are also said to have died.\nThe defendants are risking long prison sentences and having their licenses revoked for life.\nThis crackdown on horse doping in 2020 also motivated congress to pass the first law establishing national regulations for the sport of horse racing. This law was Horseracing Safety and Integrity Act, which will also create a new enforcement agency to enforce the law."

The Catamounts represented the University of Vermont and were coached by Todd Woodcroft, in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nAfter a mercifully abbreviated season the year before, Vermont's rebuild under Woodcroft continued with a slow start. The Catamounts' offense was woefully inadequate for most of the season with the team able to score more than 3 goals on only three occasions. Surprisingly, the first of those happened against #9 Boston College. While time would later diminish that achievement due to a poor season from the Eagles, it was still Vermont's first victory over their conference rivals in six years. Unfortunately, the Catamounts had to wait almost a month for their second win. It was only a winning weekend against Maine that kept Vermont out of the conference cellar, though only by a hair's breadth.\nDuring the winter break, Dovar Tinling left the team and signed with the Des Moines Buccaneers. Because it was a junior club, Tinling remained eligible for Division I college hockey.\nThe Catamounts did only marginally better in the second half of the season, recording five more wins to bring their season's total up to eight. The defense played admirably in front of both Gabe Carriere and Tyler Harmon, limiting the opposition to less than 30 shots per game. The offense, however, didn't improve and neither goaltender received much help in that respect.\nWhen Vermont entered the postseason, they were a severe underdog against Providence. Though they did well to keep the score close against the Friars, the Catamounts were more than doubled in shots and scored their only marker of the game on the power play after Carriere had been pulled for an extra attacker.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

There, the roster defeated Team Empire 3–2 in a close series to qualify for the main event.\nAt the main event, the roster secured a place in the upper bracket after going 10–6 in the group stage, where they were set to face Invictus Gaming. There, the team lost the series 2–1 to drop down to the lower bracket, where the team made a miraculous run to the finals after notably defeating the two-time defending champions OG, Virtus.pro, the team that had sent them down to the lower bracket Invictus Gaming, and Team Secret to face off against PSG.LGD in the grand finals.

With this win, they were the first Eastern European team to win an International since Natus Vincere in the inaugural International in 2011.

The roster found success midway into the season, after defeating Team Liquid 3–1 in the Grand Finals of the 2023 Riyadh Masters, receiving 5,000,000 for winning the tournament. The team later won their second consecutive tournament, defeating Shopify Rebellion in the DreamLeague Season 21 grand finals.

        "text": "India competed at the 2022 Commonwealth Games at Birmingham, England from 28 July to 8 August 2022. It was India's 18th appearance at the Commonwealth Games.\nIn July 2022, the Indian team of 106 men and 104 women competing in 16 sports was named. India did not compete in 3x3 basketball, beach volleyball, netball and rugby sevens. Indian para-athletes competed in athletics, para powerlifting, swimming and table tennis.\nHockey player Manpreet Singh and badminton athlete P. V. Sindhu served as the country's opening ceremony flagbearers.\nSquash player Anahat Singh became the youngest Indian athlete to compete at the Commonwealth Games at just 14 years of age. 45-year old Lawn Bowls player Sunil Bahadur was the oldest player in the contingent.\nIndia's first medal of the Games was won by Sanket Sargar with a silver in weightlifting. Saikhom Mirabai Chanu won the first gold medal for the country, also in weightlifting. India won its first ever medals in Lawn Bowls after the Women's Fours team won the Gold medal, and were followed by the Men's fours team winning a silver medal. Sharath Kamal was India's most successful player at the Games, having won four (3 gold and 1 silver) medals in table tennis.\nIndia ended the games as the best nation in 4 sports: badminton, table tennis, wrestling and weightlifting and second best in boxing.\nWithdrawal threat.\nFollowing a June 2019 decision by the Commonwealth Games Federation Executive Board to back BOCCG's proposal that archery and shooting not be included in the 2022 sport programme, IOA President Narinder Batra proposed that India boycott the 2022 Games, claiming the CGF leadership had an \"India bashing mindset\" and that \"people with a particular mindset\" could not tolerate India's sporting prowess (of which shooting sports constitute a significant portion).\nHowever, the IOA later withdrew its boycott threat and proposed the hosting of a combined archery and shooting championships, scheduled to take place in Chandigarh during January 2022. The proposal was backed by associated stakeholders and subsequently received official approval on the proviso that India bore the cost of hosting the event; medals awarded in Chandigarh would be included in the 2022 Games overall medal table a week after the closing ceremony. In July 2021, the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn October 2021, Hockey India withdrew both hockey teams from the Games, citing the pandemic within the United Kingdom and the proximity of Birmingham 2022 to the 2022 Asian Games (with Paris 2024 Olympic qualification at stake in the latter); the decision was made in response to the UK's non-recognition of Indian COVID-19 vaccination certificates and England Hockey withdrawing from the 2021 Men's FIH Hockey Junior World Cup in Bhubaneswar. Following discussions with the IOA and Sports Minister Anurag Thakur, the federation determined that India would, subject to qualification, participate in the Commonwealth hockey tournaments.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating at the Games per sport/discipline.\nAthletics.\nFollowing the National Inter-State Athletics Championships in Chennai, a squad of thirty-seven athletes was selected on 16 June 2022.\nBadminton.\nBy virtue of its position in the combined BWF World Ranking (as of 1 February 2022), India qualified for the mixed team event. Following the Senior Selection Trials, a full squad of ten players was selected on 20 April 2022.\nBoxing.\nFollowing the men's selection trials on 2 June 2022, eight boxers were selected for the competition. The women's trials and selection of four more boxers followed on 11 June 2022.\nCricket.\nBy virtue of its position in the ICC Women's T20I rankings (as of 1 April 2021), India qualified for the tournament.\nFixtures were announced in November 2021.\nFifteen players were officially selected on 11 July 2022.\nReserves: Simran Bahadur, Richa Ghosh, Poonam Yadav\nCycling.\nThirteen cyclists (9 men and 4 women) have been officially selected to represent India at CWG 2022.\nHockey.\nBy virtue of its position in the FIH World Rankings for men and women respectively (as of 1 February 2022), India qualified for both tournaments. Detailed fixtures were released on 9 March 2022.\nHockey India originally sought to send reserve squads to the Commonwealth Games; this was so the primary squads could focus on the Asian Games tournaments and attempt to qualify for the 2024 Summer Olympics at the first opportunity. Owing to the subsequent postponement of the 2022 Asian Games, a full-strength men's squad for the Commonwealth Games was confirmed on 20 June 2022; an experienced women's squad was also confirmed on 23 June 2022.\nJudo.\nIndia announced a six-member judo team following selection trials held from May 23 to May 26.\nSquash.\nAs of 12 July 2022, a team of 9 athletes will represent India in the squash competition at the Games.\nSwimming.\nIndia declared its four-member swimming team on 25 June 2022.\nTable tennis.\nIndia qualified for both the men's and women's team events via the ITTF World Team Rankings (as of 2 January 2020). Seven players were selected on 31 May 2022; the women's selections were provisional and dependent on SAI approval since Archana Kamath was selected even though she did not satisfy the selection criteria.\nThe SAI returned responsibility for the decision back to the \"Committee of Administrators\"; Diya Chitale, who filed a writ petition to the Delhi High Court protesting her non-selection, replaced Kamath in the amended squad. Another player was also added to the men's squad.\nTriathlon.\nA squad of four triathletes (two per gender) was selected for the competition; the men will be named at a later date.\nWeightlifting.\nA squad of 15 weightlifters was confirmed on 13 April 2022.\nJeremy Lalrinnunga, Achinta Sheuli, Ajay Singh and Purnima Pandey qualified for the competition by winning gold at the 2021 Commonwealth Weightlifting Championships in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The other 11 qualified via the IWF Commonwealth Ranking List, which was finalised on 9 March 2022.\nWrestling.\nFollowing the women's selection trials on 16 May 2022, six wrestlers were selected for the competition. The men's trials and selection of six more wrestlers followed on 17 May 2022."

        "text": "The 2021-22 RPI Engineers Men's ice hockey season was the 102nd season of play for the program and the 60th season in the ECAC Hockey conference. The Engineers represented Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and played their home games at Houston Field House, and were coached by Dave Smith, in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nRensselaer returned to the ice after losing all of last season to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team began the year with a decent start, albeit against fairly weak competition. But looked to be in good standing after taking down Clarkson in early November. However, the following week, the Engineers were embarrassed by Cornell 3–11, the program's worst loss in decades. Afterwards, the defense recovered but the team was soon beset by a lack of offense over a several week span. RPI ended their first half with a 2–6 run with the only saving grace being that five of those losses were to non-conference teams.\nAfter returning from the winter break, Rensselaer was forced to postpone or cancel several games in early January due to an increase in positive COVID-19 tests. When they did began playing games, the team also found itself in need of a new starting goaltender as presumptive primary netminder, Linden Marshall, had not performed well enough to retain the job. Newcomer Jack Watson was a bit inconsistent in his early appearances, but he possessed a higher ceiling than Marshall and Dave Smith eventually settled on the freshman as the starter. The offense also saw a steady improvement after returning to action but remained hot and cold for the remainder of the regular season. RPI would regularly follow stunning victories with confounding losses and ended the year just under .500. However, with a 6th-place finish, they did at least receive a home site for the first round of the conference tournament.\nDespite having Marshall in net for the regular season finale, Watson led the Engineers into the postseason. Despite vastly outshooting Dartmouth in the opening match, RPI fell 2–3. The offense continued to pressure the Big Green net in the next two games and took advantage of several power play opportunities, riding their special team to consecutive wins and advancing to the quarterfinals. Rensselaer took control of the first game when they gained a 3–0 lead early in the third period. Watson kept Harvard off of the scoresheet despite a barrage of shots but, after the Crimson pulled their goaltender, the tide began to turn. RPI was swarmed over by Harvard and surrendered 3 goals in the final 4 minutes, all with the aide of an extra attacker. The momentum remained with their opponents and the Engineers allowed the winning goal just 2 minutes into overtime.\nThe second game did not have quite as much drama but it still saw Harvard tying the game late and force overtime once more. Watson was again called upon to stop a multitude of Crimson shots but this time he held his ground in the extra frame and sent the match into a second overtime. John Beaton saved the Engineer's season with the winner and set up a deciding third game. Watson was up to the task, holding Harvard to 2 goals, but the offense was not. RPI was stymied by the Crimson defense and the team fell 1–3.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Pioneers represented Sacred Heart University and were coached by C. J. Marottolo, in his 13th season.\nSeason.\nSacred Heart spent the entire season hovering around the .500 mark. The team was effectively average in all aspects of the game; neither their offense nor defense were particularly strong, but both couldn't be called weaknesses either. Over the course of the season, Sacred Heart's longest losing streak was just three games but they weren't able to put together any long stretches of winning hockey. The Pioneers got mostly reliable goaltending from junior Justin Robbins but also buoyed his efforts with stints from both Josh Benson and Luke Lush.\nProbably the best performance from the team came in the Connecticut Ice semifinal when they lost to #2 Quinnipiac into overtime. The Pioneers had led late, only to see the Bobcats tie the score after pulling their goalie.\nThe Pioneers' 5th-place finish in Atlantic Hockey earned them an automatic bid into the conference quarterfinals. Despite outplaying RIT for a majority of the three-game series, Sacred Heart's offense was lacking and scored just once in their two losses.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2021–22 St. Cloud State Huskies men's ice hockey season was the 87th season of play for the program, the 25th at the Division I level and the 9th in the NCHC conference. The Huskies represented St. Cloud State University and were coached by Brett Larson, in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nAfter reaching the championship game for the first time in program history, St. Cloud entered this season hoping to return and complete the job. The Huskies returned most of the men from the year before and lost none of the principle players, giving them a leg-up in the teamwork department. They retained the high ranking from the end of 2021 as they began the season and did so in tremendous fashion, scoring 12 goals in the season opener. While it did come against St. Thomas, a team that was playing its first game at the Division I level, it was still an impressive start. The second week could not have been a bigger contrast as the Huskies faced the #1 team in the nation, Minnesota State. St. Cloud acquitted itself well with a split, a feat that repeated the next week against #4 Minnesota. After a sweep of Wisconsin, St. Cloud found itself as the #1 ranked team and set about proving that they were worth of the honor.\nA loss in mid-November caused the team to slip down to #2 but the Huskies took a bigger hit when they were swept by a surprising Western Michigan squad just before Thanksgiving. After following with another split, the Huskies fell out of the top-5 for the first time and entered the winter break with a solid but unspectacular record. St. Cloud was, however, the beneficiary of playing in the toughest conference in the nation. With their good non-conference mark, the team could afford a few losses and still earn a return to the national tournament.\nAfter coming back with a sweep of Bemidji State, St. Cloud's season was put on hold due to positive COVID-19 tests that forced several games around the country to be delayed or cancelled. They didn't get back onto the ice until late-January and, though the Huskies played well in their return, the extra time off appeared to have taken the jam out of their game. St. Cloud went through a 6-game streak without a win and plummeted in the conference standings. Three ties during that run prevented them from falling out of postseason contention, but they found themselves on the edge by mid-February. A good weekend against WMU helped arrest their slide but they were back in trouble after losing two to Omaha.\nThe final five game of the Huskies season would make or break the team and 5th-year starter Dávid Hrenák came up huge. He sandwiched three stirling performances against Minnesota Duluth around a pair of wins that kept the team's head above water, making it all but certain that St. Cloud would receive an at-large bid regardless of what happened in the postseason. Unfortunately, as the Huskies were preparing for the conference quarterfinals, Hrenák came down with pneumonia and was unable to play. Backup Jaxon Castor had played decently in spots during the season, so there was hope that the team could play well enough defensively to insulate the understudy. That hope was banished by Duluth, who fired a total of 79 shots on goal in the two games, and scored 9 goals to knock St. Cloud out in the first round.\nAs was expected, however, St. Cloud State ended the season as #10 in the PairWise rankings and was guaranteed a spot in the tournament. With Hrenák on the mend, the team would need to put forth a better effort and give their starter the time he needed to return. In the opening game they faced the nation's top defensive team, Quinnipiac. The Huskies got behind early, allowing two goals in the first, but then responded by completely outplaying the Bobcats in the final 40 minutes. St. Cloud scored three times in the second, tying the game on two separate occasions, and limited their opponents to just 16 shots on goal. Senior Nolan Walker led the way with a 3-point night as the team scored four goals against Quinnipiac, the most they had allowed all season. Unfortunately, Castor did not play well in goal. He was beaten on 5 of the shots he faced and St. Cloud's season ended in heartbreaking fashion.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "2021 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2021 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2021 National Rugby League season in Australia. It was contested between the Penrith Panthers and the South Sydney Rabbitohs on Sunday 3 October at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. Penrith won the match 14–12 to claim their third premiership title, and their first since 2003. Penrith co-captain and halfback Nathan Cleary was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as the official man of the match.\nThe event was held in Brisbane for the first time in the competition's history due to an ongoing COVID-19 lockdown in New South Wales which prompted the NRL to relocate it from Stadium Australia in Sydney, where every NRL Grand Final since 1999 had been hosted. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the match was attended by only 39,322 spectators because the Queensland Government limited Suncorp Stadium to seventy-five percent of its maximum capacity.\nThe match was preceded by the 2021 Queensland Cup preliminary finals and broadcast live throughout Australia by the Nine Network, with pre-match and half-time entertainment headlined by Kate Miller-Heidke, Ian Moss, The Stafford Brothers, Timmy Trumpet, William Barton and a forty-piece Queensland orchestra.\nThis was the last game to be commentated by long-time announcer Ray Warren.\nBackground.\nThis was the first ever NRL Grand Final between the Penrith Panthers and the South Sydney Rabbitohs, and the first time since 2014 that the Grand Final featured two Sydney-based clubs. The Penrith side aimed for a third premiership, after defeating Canberra Raiders in 1991 and Sydney Roosters in 2003. It was also Ivan Cleary's third Grand Final appearance as a coach, after losing with the New Zealand Warriors against Manly Sea Eagles in 2011, and losing with the Penrith side against Melbourne Storm in 2020. Meanwhile, the Rabbitohs were aiming for their 22nd premiership victory; their most recent being against Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in 2014. It was also Wayne Bennett's tenth Grand Final appearance as a coach after winning seven of the previous nine.\nAfter finishing as minor premiers and runners-up in 2020, the Panthers finished the 2021 regular season in second place after twenty-one wins and three losses.\nSouth Sydney finished third after twenty wins and four losses. During the regular season, the Rabbitohs scored 775 points, the fourth highest of all time in competition history. Despite this, they conceded 50 points in a game twice during the home and away season, to the Panthers and the Melbourne Storm, dampening their premiership aspirations with no side ever winning the premiership after doing so. In the Rabbitohs' 54-12 victory over the Roosters in round 24, fullback Latrell Mitchell was suspended for 6 matches for reckless high contact on Joseph Manu. Rookie Blake Taaffe replaced him the next week, playing just his fourth NRL match at the time.\nDuring the regular season, the two teams faced each other twice. In round 11, the Panthers defeated the Rabbitohs 56–12 at Apex Oval. In round 23, the Panthers won 25–12 at Suncorp Stadium. However, in a major upset in the first week of the finals Series, South Sydney defeated Penrith 16–10 at Queensland Country Bank Stadium in the Qualifying Final and advanced straight to the Preliminary Finals two weeks later, beating Manly Warringah Sea Eagles 36–16 at Suncorp Stadium to advance to the Grand Final. After losing to Souths, Penrith defeated Parramatta Eels 8–6 in the Semi-Finals one week later at BB Print Stadium. The following week, Penrith defeated the minor premiers Melbourne Storm 10–6 in what was seen as a rematch of the previous year's grand final, during the Preliminary Final at Suncorp Stadium, to advance to the Grand Final.\nPre-match.\nBroadcasting.\nThe match was broadcast live on the Nine Network and delayed on Fox League in Australia and Sky Sport in New Zealand. Radio broadcasters included ABC, Triple M, 2GB, SEN and Koori Radio.\nCurtain-raiser matches.\nCurtain-raiser matches on the day included two matches.\nTeams.\nMatt Burton, Spencer Leniu, Paul Momirovski and Scott Sorensen were new additions to the Penrith squad that played in the 2020 grand final. For the South Sydney side, Tom Burgess, Alex Johnston and Adam Reynolds were the only remaining players from Souths' last premiership victory in 2014. Panthers hooker Apisai Koroisau was also part of the 2014 Souths premiership-winning squad. Blake Taaffe, who replaced suspended fullback Latrell Mitchell, became the least experienced player in a grand final, playing only his eighth game in the NRL. A few days later at club level, Taaffe won the John Sattler Medal for rookie of the year. After the match, South Sydney interchange Benji Marshall retired from his NRL career with a total of 346 matches played.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;section begin=2021 NRL Grand Final/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard/&gt;\n&lt;section end=2021 NRL Grand Final/&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard/&gt;\nSecond half.\nReynolds missed the conversion which could have locked up the game at 14-14, and send it to extra time.\nOpening Games.\nThe NRL announced that the opening games would be the Intrust Super Cup Preliminary Finals."

It is held in the preseason, usually around late August to early September.\nAfter an agreement was signed by the Provincial Council of Álava and Saski Baskonia in 1990, the tournament was set to be played under the name \"Trofeo Diputación Foral de Álava\", and it would serve as an introduction between the season's team and the fans. It featured Baskonia and two other teams, usually having a Liga ACB team and an international team have a round-robin tournament to determine the overall winner. From 1996 onwards, the format changed to a single game tournament, and has remained like that ever since. In 2018, the name \"Trofeo Álava / Araba Saria\" was adopted, but it is still commonly referred to as Trofeo Diputación by Baskonia fans.\nThe tournament has been held every year since 1991, with the exceptions of 1998, as the expansion works for the Araba Arena were being carried out during the months when the tournament was played, and 2020, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of the 31 times it has been contested, Baskonia has won it 28 times."

        "text": "The 2021–22 New Hampshire Wildcats Men's ice hockey season was the 96th season of play for the program and the 38th season in the Hockey East conference. The Wildcats represented the University of New Hampshire and were coached by Mike Souza, in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nFor much of the season, New Hampshire's attempt at rebuilding the program were hampered by a lack of offense. The Wildcats finished almost as many games being shut out (four) as scoring more than 3 goals (five). A majority of the team's victories came as a result of strong defensive play.\nUNH had their moments during the year, defeating several ranked teams, but they couldn't sustain their success for long. In the first half of the season the wildcats hovered around the .500 mark. After returning from the winter break, the team went on a 5-game winning streak to get their head above water. After that good stretch, however, the team stumbled down the stretch and lost eight of their final ten games. The offense was about as strong as it had been earlier in the year but the defense faltered, allowing almost 4 goals per game over that span.\nThe result of their poor finish was that New Hampshire slid down the Hockey East standings and had to open the conference playoffs on the road. They travelled south to play Boston College and vastly outshot the Eagles in the match, 47–27. Unfortunately, the defense was again an issue and the team needed a hat-trick from Tyler Ward just to get the game into overtime. It was not the Wildcat's night, unfortunately, and BC netted the game-winner. The loss capped off the season which, though it was an improvement over the previous campaign, was the 8th consecutive year that UNH did not possess a winning record.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The 14 races, all but one of which are Grade I, took place on November 5 and 6 at Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California and were telecast by NBC and NBC Sports. The Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North America racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December. The event typically determines champions in many of the Eclipse Award divisions.\nQualifying.\nA maximum of 14 horses (12 in the Turf Sprint and Juvenile Turf Sprint) are allowed to start in each race. Horses can automatically qualify by winning one of the designated races in the Breeders' Cup Challenge series, which provide \"Win and You're In\" berths in a specified division of the Breeders' Cup. Other pre-entries are ranked by a points system and the judgement of a panel of experts.\nOn October 27, a total of 196 horses were pre-entered in the Breeders' Cup, of which 46 were automatic qualifiers through the challenge races. A record 56 horses were based outside the United States — 26 from Great Britain, 17 from Ireland, 8 from Japan, 2 from France and 1 from each of Argentina, Peru and South Africa. The post position draw was held on November 1.\nEvent preparation.\nDel Mar Racetrack hosted the Breeders' Cup for the second time. Spectators were allowed with appropriate health measures, unlike the 2020 event that was held with only essential personnel in attendance, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Specially built corporate chalet expanded the on-track seating to 25,000, with general admission and infield seating bringing the total capacity to 37,500. Del Mar also built quarantine barns to support the large contingent of international horses.\nTV coverage.\nIn the United States the Breeders' Cup was televised live on NBC, NBCSN, and TVG, with the majority of coverage televised over both days on NBCSN and TVG on both days. The Breeders' Cup Classic was live and in prime time on NBC.\nIn the United Kingdom, ITV telecast Breeders' Cup Turf and Breeders' Cup Classic on the main channel and the other races except for the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Sprint, which were telecast on ITV4.\nRaces.\nThe post times for the Breeders' Cup program were announced on September 30 and the official race sequence was announced on October 27. The pools for multi-race wagers (early and late Pick 5, and Super Pick 5) on Friday would rollover to Saturday if there was no winning bet. The corresponding races on Saturday had a mandatory payout. For the first time, the Breeder's Cup ran an All-Turf Pick 4 for the four Turf races on the Saturday card. The handle for the two days set a record of US$154.45 million.\nFriday, November 5.\nThe five Breeders' Cup races on Friday were exclusively for two-year-olds. Echo Zulu was the dominating winner of the Juvenile Fillies, wrapping up championship honors in her division. Corniche was also an easy winner in the Juvenile and will contend with Jack Christopher, who was scratched from the race due to a minor injury, for the title of champion two-year-old colt. However, Corniche is not eligible on the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby as he is trained by Bob Baffert, who has been banned by Churchill Downs from running horses in the Kentucky Derby for two years due to a drug positive in the 2021 event. \nThe running of the Juvenile Turf was marked by controversy. The favorite, Albahr, reared in stall 2 of the starting gate and fell over, injuring an assistant starter. Once he was removed from the gate, Albahr was inspected by track veterinarians and was scratched for minor injuries. Meanwhile, Modern Games, his stablemate in stall 1, was released from the front of the gate to avoid possible injury and was quickly pulled up. He too was inspected and was passed as sound. However, the parimutuel feed to other racetracks marked both horses as scratched. When the stewards noticed the error, they announced that Modern Games, who would have become the favorite, would be running for purse money only. Single race bets (win, place, show and exotics involving either Albahr (#2) or Modern Games (#1)) were refunded. When Modern Games won the race, the \"win\" bet was payable on the horse that actually finished second, and so on. Even more significantly, the Juvenile Turf was the final leg in multi-race wagers (Pick 4 and Pick 5). Bettors with a \"live\" ticket, meaning they had picked the winners of the earlier races, who had picked either #1 or #2 in the final leg were automatically given the new post-time favorite, which turned out to be Dakota Gold (#3). However, Dakota Gold finished fifth, so none of those tickets paid off. If not for the error regarding his eligibility, Modern Games would have been the post-time favorite and the bets with either #1 or #2 would have been successful.\nIn the Juvenile Fillies Turf, Pizza Bianca won after a last-to-first stretch run that was captured on an on-board camera mounted on the helmet of her jockey, José Ortiz. The filly is owned and bred by celebrity chef Bobby Flay, and was the first winner at the Breeders' Cup for her trainer Christophe Clement, who won his first Breeders Cup race in his 41st start.\nAn asterisk after the odds means the horse was the post-time favorite.\nSource: Equibase"

He committed to play college football at the University of Florida.\nCollege career.\nRichardson appeared in just four games during his first year at Florida in 2020, completing one of two passes for 27 yards with a touchdown and interception. He was able to redshirt his first year of collegiate eligibility. Richardson entered 2021 as the backup to Emory Jones. Against LSU, he replaced Jones and completed 10 of 19 passes for 167 yards with three touchdowns, two interceptions and a rushing touchdown.\nRichardson officially became the starting quarterback for the Gators in 2022. In the first game of the season, he helped lead a 29–26 upset over the seventh-ranked Utah Utes on September 3, 2022. On September 24, in a 38–33 loss to Tennessee, Richardson passed for 453 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception to go along with 17 carries for 62 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. \nOverall, in 2022, Richardson played in 12 games and passed for 2,549 yards, 17 touchdowns and 9 interceptions, as well as rushing for 654 yards and 9 touchdowns in his first full season as a starting quarterback for a college team. During his time at Florida, Richardson amassed a 6-6 record as the starting quarterback for the Gators.\nAs a collegiate player, Richardson was stated to have displayed \"dynamic talent\" as a passer and runner during his college years. Richardson's physical gifts also helped propel him as a possible first-round NFL draft selection. Following the end of the 2022 season, Richardson announced that he would enter the 2023 NFL draft.\nProfessional career.\nRichardson was drafted in the first round by the Indianapolis Colts with the fourth overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. Richardson's combine measurables ranked him as the most athletic quarterback prospect in league history according to the Relative Athletic Score (RAS) metric. He joined Cam Newton and Daunte Culpepper as the only quarterbacks to have achieved a perfect RAS score.\nDuring his first training camp with the Colts, Richardson underwent nasal septum surgery to improve his breathing. On August 15, 2023, Richardson was named by head coach Shane Steichen as the Colts' starting quarterback over Gardner Minshew and Sam Ehlinger.\nOn September 10, 2023, Richardson made his NFL debut in Week 1 against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Richardson threw his first touchdown pass to Michael Pittman Jr, ran for a touchdown, and threw his first career interception to Tyson Campbell in the 31-21 loss. In Week 2 against the Houston Texans, Richardson ran for two touchdowns before leaving the game with a concussion in the second quarter.\nOn September 22, 2023, Richardson was declared out in Week 3 due to a concussion he suffered in Week 2. He returned the next week against the Los Angeles Rams and recorded two passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown and erased a 23 point deficit in a 29-23 loss in overtime. His rushing touchdown in this game marked the first time in NFL history that a rookie quarterback has scored a rushing touchdown in each of his first three starts.\nOn October 9, 2023, Richardson was placed on the injured reserve due to a grade three AC joint sprain he suffered in Week 5 against the Tennessee Titans, which was initially announced for him to miss one to two months. On October 18, 2023, the Colts announced that Richardson would miss the remainder of the season, and successfully underwent shoulder surgery to repair the sprain on October 24, 2023."

Tim Lafai scored the first try of the game in the sixth minute to give Samoa a 4–0 lead, and for the first time in the tournament, England conceded first. Five minutes later, Junior Paulo was shown a yellow card, and also put on report, for a dangerous tackle on George Williams. Elliott Whitehead scored England's first try on 25 minutes, with Tommy Makinson successful with the conversion, to give England a 6–4 lead. Five minutes later, Samoa scored again, this time from Ligi Sao to retake the lead 8–4; Stephen Crichton was successful with the conversion to give Samoa a 10–4 lead at half-time.\nFive minutes into the second half, England scored again, this time through John Bateman, and Makinson was once again successful with the conversion to make it 10–10. Two tries in seven minutes saw Samoa take a 20–12 lead, with England now needing at least two tries to draw level. Herbie Farnworth broke clear on 65 minutes, to race away and touch down near the posts, giving Makinson an easy conversion. From the kick-off, England were awarded a penalty, after Sam Tomkins was tackled in the air. Samoa used the captain's challenge, and after a quick review, the video referee agreed with the decision to award the penalty, meaning the challenge was unsuccessful. Makinson opted to kick the penalty and was successful, levelling the scores at 20–20 with just over 12 minutes remaining. Stephen Crichton looked to have won it for Samoa with sven minutes to go, as he intercepted a Dom Young pass to touch down under the posts, converting his own try. There was more drama to come, as Farnworth got his second try of the game with two minutes remaining, Makinson once again converting to take the game to extra time.\nSamoa attempted to score the golden point with a drop goal early in extra time, but it was charged down by England. Samoa eventually won the match after a forward pass from Sam Tomkins gave them possession 35 metres out. Crichton kicked the winning drop goal to send Samoa to their first World Cup final, making them the first team other than England, Australia or New Zealand to reach the final in 50 years.\nThe peak TV audience for the match was approximately 2.5 million views, which is the highest for any international rugby league match.\n&lt;section begin=SF2 /&gt;&lt;section begin=SF21 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=SF21 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=SF2 /&gt;"

The RedHawks represented Miami University and were coached by Chris Bergeron, in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nMiami opened the season with a solid performance but then saw its offense stall for much of the next two months. The RedHawks earned a surprising win over Omaha in early November but that was one of the only bright spots during the first half of the season. While their conference schedule was a murders row of ranked teams, the team couldn't get on track with its non-conference schedule, losing games to Long Island and Ferris State, two of the weakest teams in Division I hockey.\nLudvig Persson received the bulk of minutes in the crease despite fairly pedestrian performance. Even so, he was ill-served by a porous defense that allowed an average of more than 35 shots against per game. As a result, Miami was one of the worst defensive teams in the country. Only St. Thomas, who were playing their first season at the D-I level, allowed more goals.\nThe team's poor play continued through January, leaving the team with just a single conference win in sixteen matches. After a week off at the beginning of February, however, the RedHawks were able to recharge and sweep a series against the Mavericks, winning consecutive games for the first time in over a year. Even while losing five of their next six to end the regular season, the team kept the score close on most nights and appeared to have found some level of fight.\nThe late-season improvement did not prevent the team from finishing last in the conference. Miami was set against Denver in the NCHC quarterfinals and, predictably, did not fare well versus the #3 team in the country.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

In the second season of the conference's existence, Northern Illinois' Jim Bradley won the inaugural award. The conference disbanded after that year due to only having five members, and in order to be recognized by the NCAA, a conference was required to have six or more member institutions."

They represented Clarkson University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 61st season in the ECAC Hockey conference. The Golden Knights were coached by Casey Jones, in his 11th season, and played their home games at Cheel Arena.\nSeason.\nAfter twice missing out on a chance to participate in the NCAA tournament, both as a direct result of COVID-19, Clarkson entered the '22 season looking for a bit of redemption. The Golden Knights got off to a less-than-stellar start, holding a .500 record in early November with three of their wins coming against Alaska, who were still recovering from not having played at all the year before. A strong performance from defending Rookie of the Year Ethan Haider in the second month helped Clarkson right the ship and enabled the team to climb back into the rankings by the beginning of December. Just as things were looking up for the team, Haider's game began to slip. He allowed 13 goals in three games with Clarkson losing each match.\nThe second half of the season was dominated by Haider being replaced in goal by Jacob Mucitelli while the team's nominal starter fought to rediscover his game. Mucitelli played well in goal, helping the Knights to an 11-game stretch where they didn't lose once. The hefty win total allowed Clarkson to get into the top-15 with a potential shot at an at-large bid but the team had a problem. ECAC Hockey possessed a terrible non-conference record. Part of the league's problem was that eight member teams had not played in 2021 and many were slow to get back into the swing of things. Whatever the cause, however, the poor marks meant that most of Clarkson's conference opponents were rated as weak competition in the PairWise rankings. This meant that each win for Clarkson didn't help the team as much as it otherwise would have while losses proved to be a sizable drag on their postseason hopes. When Clarkson lost two games near the end of the year, the team was pushed out of at-large contention despite being 10 games above .500.\nEven finishing second in the conference didn't help Clarkson for the NCAA tournament, but it did give the team a decent draw for the conference quarterfinals. By that time, Haider and Mucitelli were in a battle for the starting role and each was given the chance to play one of the games against Union. Clarkson won both games in overtime but with Haider allowing fewer goals, he was given the start in the semifinal match versus Harvard. Entering the game, Clarkson was just outside the cutoff for an at-large bid and would have to at least reach the conference championship game to make the tournament. The Knights were locked in a close battle against the Crimson for much of the game, twice tying the score in the first two periods before taking a 1-goal lead into the third. Harvard ended up scoring three goals in the final frame to Clarkson's none and the Knights narrowly missed out on the tournament.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Raiders represented the Colgate University and played their home games at Class of 1965 Arena, and were coached by Don Vaughan, in his 29th season as their head coach.\nSeason.\nColgate got off to a hot start, winning its first four games and nearly entering the top-20. The Raiders played a pivotal game against Western Michigan at the end of October and looked to be heading for a surprise win when the jumped out to a 5–0 lead. In the second half of the game, however, the Broncos completely took over the game and scored six unanswered goals to take the match. That loss kicked off a downward stretch for the team that saw them go 3–12–2 over a three month period. Other than a pair of shutouts in November, there was very little that went right for the Raiders. The team's offense was inconsistent, their goaltending was suspect and they sank towards the bottom of the conference standings.\nAfter Carter Gylander lost his starting role in early January, both backups received time in goal but nothing seemed to work. Finally, at the end of the month, Mitch Benson put together a string of good games and allowed the team to get back on its feet. Over the final month of the season, Colgate started winning again and charged up the standings. The Raiders propelled themselves into a mediocre record, good enough for 5th in the ECAC. While they still had to play in the First Round of the conference tournament, they did so against the weakest opponent.\nColgate got a small scare in the first game when Yale tied the match in the last minute of regulation to force overtime. After escaping with a win, the Raiders were much better in the second game and swept the series. In the quarterfinals, Benson was assailed by the Cornell offense, facing 43 shots in the first match. After the loss, the team had no room for error and responded with a strong performance in game 2, tying the series with an offensive outburst. The final meeting looked more like the first, with the Big Red firing shot after shot on goal but Benson was equal to the task. He held Cornell scoreless for over 59 minutes, allowing the Riders to build a 2–0 lead, but lost his shutout bid with just 8 seconds to play. The result was what Colgate needed however, and the team advanced to the semifinals.\nBecause of the poor middle to their season, Colgate had no chance to make the NCAA tournament without winning the conference championship. To do that they would first have to get past Quinnipiac, who had been ranked #1 earlier in the season. The top seed didn't take pity on the Raiders and got out to a 2 goal lead in the first period. Colgate upped their game in the second, cutting the Bobcats' advantage in half, but the Raider offense couldn't net a tying goal. A third goal midway through the third put Quinnipiac back up by 2 Colgate's tournament hopes were dashed shortly afterwards.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The season turned out to be effectively a rebuilding year for the program with the team's offense being substandard for most of the campaign. While the defense wasn't much better, sophomore Dominic Basse kept the Tigers in many games early in the season. Despite some goaltending heroics, CC's pop-gun offense provided the team with just 2 wins in their first 13 games.\nWhile the team was never fully able to get on track, Colorado College managed to stay out of the NCHC basement on the strength of a season sweep of Miami. The four wins against the RedHawks made up almost half of the Tigers' total for the year.\nAs the campaign progressed, Basse's play in net became inconsistent and he ended up splitting time with Matt Vernon. By the end of the season, Vernon had taken control of the starting role and was in goal for the team's two playoff games.

The team featured again in the 2017 Asian Women's Club Volleyball Championship as \"Rebisco-PSL Manila\" due to a sponsorship deal with Republic Biscuit. The team likewise finished last at 8th place. The selection team has also participated in other tournaments in Thailand and the PSL Super Cup.\nRebisco and PNVF.\nThe Philippine National Volleyball Federation succeeded the LVP in early 2021.

For the women's competition, the federation will field two teams composing of national team players. The first team will composed of more established players and the second team will be a developmental side composed of younger players.\nOriginally, the PNVF planned to send two teams in that competition; the national team under the Rebisco brand and the Chery Tiggo 7 Pro Crossovers winners of the 2021 Premier Volleyball League Open Conference. However Chery Tiggo and all the other teams in the league declined to participate. The PNVF will instead field a second team composing of national team players instead.

By reaching the final, Djokovic tied Federer's record of 31 men's singles major finals contested, and repeated his 2015 achievement of contesting the maximum-possible 28 major singles matches in a season.

Taft, who had always planned on opening a miniature golf course hired a cadre of artist friends to design the course, creating miniaturized versions of San Francisco bay area landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Painted Ladies and Lombard Street. Taft went into debt during the development of the project, almost cancelling it three times before opening on Park Street in August 2012."

        "text": "The 1946–47 Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey season was the 40th season of play for the program. The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 25th season.\nSeason.\nNow more than a full year removed from the end of World War II, college hockey was getting back to normal. For Cornell, however, little had changed; the team was still unable to expand their playing schedule due to not having an indoor rink and being relatively remote in central New York. One of the few teams willing to travel to Ithaca was nearby Colgate and the Red Raiders met the Big Red for the latter's season opener. In what would turn out to be the only home game on the year, Cornell got a late start and trailed 1–2 after 20 minutes. When visiting netminder Mark Galloway complained about the lack of light the coaches of the two teams gave their players an extended rest to see if the illumination would improve. When more sun wasn't forthcoming the teams agreed to call the game after just one period.\nThree days later, Cornell travelled south to play its first full game against Army. The match turned into a debacle for the Big Red as not only did they lose 1–8 but three players were injured in the game. Starters Ken Hillas and Wally Schmidt came up lake while reserve Dave Batt pulled a muscle in his leg and was knocked out for the year. Even without the injuries, Cornell would have been hard pressed to win the game as the team had hardly been able to practice, an all-too-familiar problem for the club. With Hillas unable to play in the next game, coach Bawlf turned to backup Bill Brady with relative unknown Jack McNair in reserve. Unfortunately for Cornell, Yale was one of the best teams in the country that year and the Elis took no mercy on the short-handed Reds. With Cornell being pummeled by the Bulldogs, McNair was put in midway through the second period and turned in a stellar performance that had the Eli faithful cheer him as he left the ice. They were able to, of course, because their team had won 13–0.\nAfter the third game, head coach Nick Bawlf fell ill and was eventually confined to his bed. When the team returned to the ice in late January for practice, their bench boss was still ailing and had to be replaced by the football team's line coach, Bud Boeringer. While Bawlf was recovering, the team's final game against Colgate was delayed when a warm spell thawed out the Raiders' rink. Several weeks later, with Bawlf still not up to coaching, Boeringer took the Big Red to Hamilton to face the 12–0 Raiders. Several changes were made to the lineup, including moving Joe Louis to right wing and promoting Buck Ellis to the top defensive pair in his place. The changes, however, didn't seem to help as Cornell was routed 3–14. The Big Red's three goals all came in the final frame with the outcome all but certain. A third match between the two was scheduled for the 22nd but was never played.\nNick Bawlf never fully recovered from his illness and died in June. Boeringer agreed to stay on as head coach for the following year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "2022 World Series",
        "text": "The 2022 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2022 season. The 118th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Houston Astros and the National League (NL) champion Philadelphia Phillies. The Astros defeated the Phillies in six games to earn their second championship. The series was broadcast in the United States on Fox television and ESPN Radio.\nThe Houston Astros entered the 2022 MLB postseason as the AL West champions and the top-seeded AL team, while the Phillies won a wild card, earning the sixth and final NL playoff berth. The Phillies took a 2–1 lead after three games, before the Astros won the final three games to win the series. Jeremy Peña won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the first position player to win the award as a rookie.\nThe series was notable for being the first series to have a universal designated hitter (DH), which had alternated in prior years. 2022 also saw the first World Series no-hitter since Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, when Astros pitchers Cristian Javier, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero, and Ryan Pressly combined to leave the Phillies hitless in Game 4. It was also the third postseason no-hitter in MLB history, after Roy Halladay's no-hitter (also at Citizens Bank Park) in Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series.\nMLB has sold sponsorships to various postseason series since 2017, with YouTube TV serving as the official presenting sponsor of the World Series from 2017 through 2019. The World Series did not have a presenting sponsor in 2020 or 2021, but resumed sponsorship in 2022. As a result of a new multi-year agreement with Capital One, this World Series was officially known as the \"2022 World Series presented by Capital One\".\nBackground.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Houston Astros and the Philadelphia Phillies following their 1980 National League Championship Series encounter, which was won by Philadelphia, 3–2, en route to winning the 1980 World Series.\nHouston and Philadelphia met in the last series of the 2022 MLB season in Houston. Houston won two of the three games, although Philadelphia clinched their postseason berth in the first game with a win. The 19-game gap between the Astros and Phillies is the second largest in World Series history, trailing only the 23-game gap in between the 93-win Chicago White Sox and the 116-win Chicago Cubs.\nHouston Astros.\nThis is the fifth World Series appearance for the Astros, and the fourth as the American League team. The Astros qualified for the 2022 postseason as the American League (AL) West division winner. It was their fifth AL West championship in six years and their second straight divisional championship. The Astros entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League. In the Division Series, they swept the fifth-seeded Seattle Mariners. In the American League Championship Series, they swept the second-seeded New York Yankees to make it to the World Series for the fourth time in the previous six seasons (2017, 2019, 2021) and the second consecutive season.\nHouston's pitching staff led the American League in 2022 with the fewest runs allowed, lowest opponent's batting average and walks plus hits per inning pitched, the most strikeouts, and posted an MLB-best 2.78 bullpen earned run average (ERA). Justin Verlander, who had missed Houston's postseason runs in 2020 and 2021, made his return from Tommy John surgery and led the AL in wins, ERA, and walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio. Rookie shortstop Jeremy Peña won the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award after batting 6-for-18 (.333) with two home runs and two doubles in the ALCS.\nDusty Baker, in his 25th season as a major league manager, was seeking his first World Series win as a manager (he won the 1981 World Series as a player with the Dodgers). At 73 years of age, Baker was the oldest manager in World Series history.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nThis was the eighth World Series appearance for the Phillies and the first since 2009. The Phillies struggled at the start of the 2022 season. On June 3, and at a record of , manager Joe Girardi was fired, and Rob Thomson, their bench coach, was named their interim manager. From there, the Phillies went . They clinched a postseason berth on the third to last day of the season; they were the last postseason team of the 12 to clinch a berth. They qualified for the postseason as the sixth seed wild card entrant with an record.\nIn the National League Wild Card Series, they swept the National League Central division winner St. Louis Cardinals, who were ranked third in the National League. In the National League Division Series, they defeated the defending World Series champion and National League East division winner Atlanta Braves in four games, the NL's second seed. In the National League Championship Series (NLCS), they defeated the fifth-seeded San Diego Padres in five games to clinch a World Series berth for the first time since 2009, which the Phillies lost in six games to the New York Yankees. Bryce Harper won the most valuable player award for the NLCS after batting 8-for-20 (.400) with two home runs and three doubles. With their third-place finish, the Phillies were the first team to finish in third place in their division to advance to a World Series since the 1981 New York Yankees.\nDave Dombrowski, the Phillies' president of baseball operations, made his fifth World Series appearance. Dombrowski is the first lead executive to make World Series appearances with four different teams, having done so with the Florida Marlins in 1997, Detroit Tigers in 2006 and 2012, and the Boston Red Sox in 2018.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThis was the first World Series since to begin on a Friday. Prior to Game 1, Eric Burton of the band Black Pumas sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Terry Puhl threw the ceremonial first pitch and Simone Biles called \"play ball!\". Justin Verlander started for the Astros while Aaron Nola started for the Phillies.\nKyle Tucker hit a solo home run off of Nola in the bottom of the second inning. Nola then gave up two singles to Yuli Gurriel and Chas McCormick. With runners at the corners, Martín Maldonado hit a run batted in single scoring Gurriel. José Altuve grounded into a double play to end the inning. Jeremy Peña doubled to start the third for Houston and Alex Bregman drew a walk. Tucker hit a three-run home run into the Astros bullpen to give Houston a 5–0 lead. Verlander took a no-hit bid into the top of the fourth inning when he gave up a single to Rhys Hoskins. Bryce Harper singled, moving Hoskins to third. Nick Castellanos drove in Hoskins with a single, and Alec Bohm drove in Harper and Castellanos with a double down the left-field line to trim the lead to two. In the top of the fifth inning, Verlander gave up a leadoff double to Brandon Marsh, and walked Kyle Schwarber. J. T. Realmuto hit a double off the base of the wall to score both runners and tie the game at five. Realmuto advanced to third on a Harper groundout, but Verlander struck out Castellanos, ending the inning. At the top of the sixth, Nola was replaced by José Alvarado, who retired the side.\nThe game remained tied through nine innings, and entered extra innings. In the top of the tenth inning, Realmuto hit a solo home run off Luis García to give the Phillies a one-run lead. After a Harper single and a Bryson Stott walk, García was taken out of the game and replaced with Ryne Stanek, who was able to get out of the inning. In the bottom of the tenth inning, David Robertson struck out Yordan Álvarez before giving up a double to Bregman. Tucker tipped off a fair ball that bounced in front of home plate and was thrown out at first. Robertson walked Gurriel, bringing pinch hitter Aledmys Díaz to the plate. Robertson threw a wild pitch to advance the runners to second and third. After working the count to 2–1, Díaz was hit on the elbow by Robertson and started toward first base. However, the home plate umpire ruled that Díaz had leaned into the pitch, resulting in ball three. On the next pitch, Díaz grounded out, ending the game. It was the first time since 2002 that a team had overcome a five-run deficit to win a World Series game, when the San Francisco Giants – also managed by Dusty Baker – blew such a lead in Game 6.\nGame 2.\nLittle Big Town performed the national anthem before Game 2. Craig Biggio threw the ceremonial first pitch to Jeff Bagwell, and Bun B called \"play ball!\". Framber Valdez started for Houston and Zack Wheeler started for Philadelphia.\nIn the first inning, Jeremy Peña hit an RBI double to score Jose Altuve for the first run. Yordan Álvarez followed with the third straight double to bring in the second run for the Astros. With that hit, Houston became the first World Series team to start a game with three straight extra-base hits. Alvarez scored the third run on an error. In the bottom of the fifth inning, Alex Bregman hit a two-run home to left field to make the score 5–0. Nick Castellanos scored the first run for the Phillies on a sacrifice fly by Jean Segura in the seventh inning to make it 5–1. In the top of the eighth inning, Kyle Schwarber hit a foul ball that was initially ruled a two-run home run, which would have made the score 5–3. Schwarber ended up flying out deep to right on the next pitch, again just missing a home run. In the top of the ninth inning, Alec Bohm scored on an error by first baseman Yuli Gurriel to make it 5–2, which proved to be the final score.\nGame 2 was also notable for umpire Pat Hoberg calling a \"perfect game\" with 129 of 129 pitches called correctly. Hoberg received widespread praise from both fans and the press for this accomplishment.\nGame 3.\nOriginally scheduled for October 31, Game 3 was postponed to November 1 due to rain. Every following game was pushed back one day. Bernie Parent, Mike Schmidt, Julius Erving, and Brandon Graham threw ceremonial first pitches, and Chloe Bailey sang the national anthem. Ranger Suárez started for Philadelphia, taking the place of Noah Syndergaard, who would have started if it had not been postponed. Lance McCullers Jr. started for Houston.\nIn the bottom of the first, Kyle Schwarber drew a walk, and Bryce Harper hit a two-run home run to right field. Alec Bohm and Brandon Marsh hit solo home runs for the Phillies in the second. Bohm's solo home run to left field in the second inning marked the 1,000th home run in World Series history. When Marsh also homered in that inning, the Phillies became the first team to hit three home runs in the first two innings of a World Series game. In the bottom of the fifth, Schwarber hit a two-run home run to dead center, and Rhys Hoskins hit a solo home run to left, making the Phillies the fourth team to hit a record five home runs in a single World Series game, joining the 1928 Yankees (Game 4 of the 1928 World Series), 1989 Athletics (Game 3 of the 1989 World Series), and 2017 Astros (Game 5 of the 2017 World Series); they are also the only team of these four to go on to lose the World Series. Furthermore, McCullers became the first pitcher in history to surrender five home runs in a postseason game. Ryne Stanek relieved McCullers after Hoskins' home run. Suárez came out of the game after throwing five scoreless innings. Connor Brogdon, Kyle Gibson, Nick Nelson, and Andrew Bellatti each pitched a scoreless inning to complete the shutout as the Phillies won 7–0. All seven runs were scored via a home run.\nGame 4.\nJimmy Rollins and Chase Utley threw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 4 and \"American Idol\" contestant Madison Watkins sang the national anthem; Utley's pitch was caught by Rob McElhenney and Rollins' by Miles Teller. An additional first pitch was thrown out by a 19-year-old cancer survivor; Jill Biden was on hand to support Stand Up to Cancer in the middle of the fifth inning. Aaron Nola made his second start of the series for the Phillies, while Cristian Javier started for the Astros. The Astros and Phillies remained scoreless through four innings. The Astros loaded the bases in the top of the fifth inning against Nola. José Alvarado relieved Nola and hit Yordan Álvarez with a pitch, scoring the game's first run and breaking a 16-innings scoreless streak for Houston. The next batter, Alex Bregman hit a two-run double, Kyle Tucker followed with a sacrifice fly, and then Yuli Gurriel singled to score Bregman.\nJavier pitched six innings on 97 pitches without allowing a hit, striking out nine batters, and walking two. He was relieved by Bryan Abreu, who struck out the side in the seventh inning. Rafael Montero pitched a hitless eighth inning for the Astros. Ryan Pressly, the Astros closer, pitched in the ninth inning for the Astros, only allowing a one-out walk to Kyle Schwarber, to complete the no-hitter. It was the first combined no-hitter in postseason history, and the second no-hitter in World Series history after Don Larsen's perfect game in . It was also the third no-hitter in postseason history, after Roy Halladay threw a no-hitter for the Phillies in the 2010 National League Division Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Coincidentally, both no-hitters took place at Citizens Bank Park, and Dusty Baker was involved as a manager in both as he had managed the Reds in 2010.\nGame 5.\nBefore Game 5, Meek Mill performed a song on the field and rode with the Phillie Phanatic on an ATV. Philadelphia native Jazmine Sullivan performed the national anthem and Brad Lidge threw the ceremonial first pitch to Carlos Ruiz. Noah Syndergaard started for the Phillies and Justin Verlander started for the Astros. The Phillies donned powder blue throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s while the Astros wore their orange jerseys.\nJosé Altuve led off the game with a double, advanced to third base on an error, and scored on a single by Jeremy Peña. Kyle Schwarber led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run to tie it. Schwarber's home run was the tenth given up by Verlander in the World Series, passing Catfish Hunter for the most allowed in World Series history. In the bottom of the second inning, Verlander struck out Rhys Hoskins to escape the bases-loaded jam to keep the game tied 1–1 after giving up a single to Jean Segura and walking both Brandon Marsh and Kyle Schwarber with two outs. Peña hit a home run to put the Astros ahead at 2–1 in the fourth inning, becoming the first rookie shortstop to hit a home run in the World Series. The Phillies, who had put runners in scoring position throughout the next four innings, did not score another run off of Verlander, who finished his appearance with six strikeouts and four walks allowed in five innings. In the top of the eighth inning, Altuve scored from third base on a ground out by Yordan Álvarez, widening the Astros' lead to 3–1. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Nick Castellanos scored on an RBI single by Jean Segura, narrowing the Phillies' deficit and putting runners on the corners. Ryan Pressly entered to try for a five-out save, his fourth appearance in the series. He recorded a strikeout and a hard-hit groundout to Trey Mancini to end the eighth inning. In the ninth inning, Chas McCormick made a leaping catch at the right-center wall on a flyball hit by J. T. Realmuto for the second out, preventing a likely extra-base hit. The next batter, Bryce Harper, was hit by a pitch, putting the tying run on first base, but Castellanos hit a groundball to short that led to the game-ending putout from Peña to Mancini to end the game. The victory was the first World Series pitching win of Verlander's career, who had gone 0–6 in his previous eight World Series starts, including Game 1.\nThe change in the World Series schedule due to rain meant Game 5 went up directly against a \"Thursday Night Football\" game between the NFL franchises of both World Series cities, in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Houston Texans, 29–17. Estimates from Nielsen Media Research showed the baseball game drew an average of five million more viewers, with a share of at least 50 in both Philadelphia and Houston. Meanwhile, the football game, originally scheduled to air on the Fox affiliates in both markets per NFL rules, moved to the MyNetworkTV affiliates in both markets.\nGame 6.\nGame 6 set the record for the latest date that a World Series game has been played. The latest a World Series game had previously been played was November 4, in both 2001 and 2009. The Astros replaced Yuli Gurriel, who exited Game 5 with a knee injury, on their roster with Korey Lee. Gallery Furniture's Jim McIngvale threw the ceremonial first pitch, Andy Grammer sang the national anthem, and George Strait called \"play ball!\" In a rematch from Game 2, Framber Valdez started for the Astros, while Zack Wheeler started for the Phillies.\nThe game was initially a pitchers' duel between Valdez and Wheeler, with the game remaining scoreless through five innings. This was eventually broken by Kyle Schwarber hitting a solo home run to right field for the Phillies off of Valdez in the top of the sixth inning. In the bottom of the sixth, Wheeler hit Martin Maldonado with a pitch, which he and J. T. Realmuto argued he leaned into akin to Aledmys Diaz's attempt in Game 1, though this time the umpire ruled in favor of the Astros. Maldonado was eventually thrown out on a fielder's choice hit by José Altuve, before Jeremy Peña hit a single to allow Altuve to reach third. With runners on the corners, Wheeler was relieved by José Alvarado in preparation for Yordan Álvarez. Alvarado then gave up a three-run go-ahead home run to Álvarez, which flew 450 feet to center field and over the batter's eye. After walking Alex Bregman and striking out Kyle Tucker, Alvarado was relieved by Seranthony Dominguez. Bregman would steal second during Tucker's at-bat; he broke his finger after clipping it on second base in the steal, but remained in the game. Christian Vázquez would then hit an RBI single off of Dominguez, allowing Bregman to score. \nFollowing the four-spot in the sixth inning, Valdez was relieved by Hector Neris and Bryan Abreu, who each pitched an inning without allowing a baserunner. In the ninth, Ryan Pressly came in to save the game. Although Realmuto hit a single off of Pressly, Rhys Hoskins, Bryce Harper, and Nick Castellanos each popped out to the outfield, with Castellanos flying out to Tucker in foul territory for the final out and World Series' conclusion, as well as Pressly's sixth save of the postseason.\nManager Dusty Baker won his first career Fall Classic victory as a manager (after 3,884 games managed, a record for a first-time winner) and Houston was the first team since the Red Sox in 2013 to officially clinch the championship in their home stadium (the Dodgers won as the home team in 2020, but that was played at a neutral site due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Peña, who was 2-for-4 in Game 6, won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He batted 10-for-25 (.400) with one home run in the series. Peña became the first-position player (and the third player overall) to win the award in his rookie season. In total for the postseason, the Houston bullpen allowed five total runs over innings for an ERA of 0.83, becoming the first team to throw at least 40 postseason innings of the bullpen with an ERA below 1.00 in major league history. The Astros became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing the previous year, with the last having been the Kansas City Royals in 2015.\nWith the win, the Astros finished 11–2 in the postseason, the fourth team to win a World Series while losing fewer than three games in the Wild Card era after the 1998 New York Yankees (11–2), the 1999 New York Yankees (11–1), and the 2005 Chicago White Sox (11–1).\nComposite line score.\n2022 World Series (4–2): Houston Astros beat Philadelphia Phillies.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nFor the 23rd straight year, the World Series was televised in the United States by Fox. Play-by-play announcer Joe Davis called the event for the first time, succeeding Joe Buck following the latter's departure from the network after 25 years as its lead World Series voice. Davis was joined by Baseball Hall of Famer John Smoltz as color analyst, and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters. Kevin Burkhardt hosted the pregame and postgame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, and David Ortiz.\nOutside of the United States, MLB Network produced an international feed through MLB International, which aired on Sportsnet in Canada, BT Sport in the United Kingdom, and ESPN in Australia. Dave Flemming called the play-by-play of the games for Anglophone viewers, with Dan Plesac as color analyst.\nRatings.\nAudience includes Fox and Fox Deportes\n\"Figures are per cited sourcing and subject to revision.\"\nRadio.\nFor the 25th consecutive year, ESPN Radio aired the series in the United States. Dan Shulman called the play-by-play, with Jessica Mendoza and Eduardo Pérez as color analysts and Buster Olney as field reporter. Kevin Winter and Doug Glanville hosted the pregame coverage. This was Shulman's 12th and final World Series broadcast for ESPN Radio, with Jon Sciambi succeeding him in 2023.\nTUDN Radio broadcast the series in Spanish, with an announcing crew including Jesús Acostas, Enrique Burak, Alberto Ferreiro, José Luis Nápoles, Luis Eduardo Quiñones and Antonio de Valdes. The flagship radio stations for both teams broadcast the series locally. In Philadelphia, WIP-FM and WTTM aired the games in English and in Spanish respectively, while KBME and KLAT did so in Houston. During the Phillies-Eagles conflict for Game 5, WIP-FM aired the Eagles game while the Phillies aired on KYW and WPHT.\nSponsorship.\nThe 2022 World Series was sponsored by Capital One, the credit card provider, as part of a new multi-year agreement. This sponsorship included logo branding in-stadium and on official digital properties on the field, as well as commercial inventory during Fox's telecasts of the games.\nAftermath.\nHouston.\nShortly after his contract expired after the 2022 World Series, James Click rejected a one-year contract offer from the Astros and the team announced that they would move on without Click. Click became the first GM since 1947 to leave an MLB franchise this quickly after winning the World Series. ESPN's Jeff Passan covered the shocking departure, characterizing owner Jim Crane as extremely hands-on and at odds with Click's management style. “Sometimes I wonder if [Crane] thinks he’s Jerry Jones,” one Astros employee told Passan. The Astros hired Atlanta Braves scout Dana Brown as their general manager on January 26, 2023. A few week later, the Toronto Blue Jays hired James Click to be the vice president of baseball strategy. Additionally, with Click's departure, former Astros star Jeff Bagwell gained more power within the organization.\nThe Astros won the AL West in 2023, but they did not do so in dominant fashion like their teams from 2017 to 2019 and 2021 to 2022. Injuries and poor performance to their rotation saw the team trade young prospects for Justin Verlander at the trade deadline, who had signed a two-year deal with the New York Mets in the off-season. Overall, they finished tied with the Texas Rangers in first-place in the AL West, but won the tie-breaker thus giving them the division. However, in the postseason, the Astros were beaten by the Rangers in the 2023 ALCS, with the visitor winning all seven games. After the season, Dusty Baker retired as manager and the team promoted long-time bench Joe Espada to manager.\nPhiladelphia.\nThree months later, the Philadelphia Eagles lost in Super Bowl LVII to the Kansas City Chiefs, suffering the third championship defeat of a Philadelphia sports team in as many months following the Union and the Phillies losses. Philadelphia was the first sports city in history to lose three straight professional sports championship games in one season.\nAfter the season, Bryce Harper underwent Tommy John surgery for his ligament tear. Despite big free agent signings such as Trea Turner and Taijuan Walker, the Phillies started off similarly in 2023 as they did in 2022, particularly without Harper until May, finishing with a sub .500 record at the start of June. They would go 65–42 from June until the rest of the season and finish as the first wildcard. They would again defeat the NL East-winning Atlanta Braves in the NLDS before being upset by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLCS by losing the team's first ever game seven at home."

        "title": "2021–22 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2021–22 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey season was the 73rd season of play for the program. They represented the University of Denver in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 9th season in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). The Pioneers were coached by David Carle, in his fourth season, and played their home games at Magness Arena. The team won the 2022 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament for their NCAA record-tying ninth national championship.\nSeason.\nAlternating streaks.\nAfter a substandard year in 2021, Denver entered the year as a bit of a mystery, particularly with how unique the previous COVID-19-shortened season had been. The Pioneers returned with many of their top players, including starting goaltender Magnus Chrona, team captain Cole Guttman and top prospect Bobby Brink. The chief unknown, however, was how well the new crop of players would mesh with the team. Denver welcomed eight new players onto the team and while graduate transfer Cameron Wright was a known quantity, the Pioneers were also adding four young players drafted by NHL teams.\nEarly returns were good for Denver as the team shot out of the gate with four wins to open the season. In those matches the offense was overpowering, averaging 6 goals a night and pushing the Pioneers into the top-10 rankings. The once criticism at the time was that Denver had played relatively weak teams. That logic bore out when Denver followed up the quick success with four consecutive losses, all to ranked teams. During the losing streak, Denver's offense went quiet, being limited to just a single goal in three of the games. The mounting defeats also dropped the team down the rankings, and they were nearly out of the top-15 by early November. Each loss had come on the road and Denver's return to the Magness Arena coincided with the team getting back on track. Denver followed up their skid with a seven-game winning streak that included its first victories of the year against a ranked team. Critically, the defense was also able to settle down during the stretch and allowed more than 2 goals against on just one occasion.\nGolden Chrona.\nAfter concluding the first half of the regular season with a loss to Minnesota Duluth, Denver returned to action with dominating performances against Alaska. Despite vastly outplaying the Nanooks, Denver only managed one win due to subpar performances from Chrona. The mediocre play seemed to drive the Swedish netminder to up his game and he reeled off three consecutive shutouts over the succeeding two weeks. While his performance did eventually cool off, Chrona remained stout in goal and helped Denver produce another long winning streak, this time posting nine victories in a row.\nBrink leading the charge.\nBobby Brink had gotten off to a decent start, with 21 points in his first 16 games, but it was after returning from the winter break that he got into his groove. From December 31 to February 19, Brink scored at least one point in every game and averaged two per game. He raced to the top of the scoring lead, taking Denver to the top of the national scoring totals with average of just over four and quarter goals per game for the year. While Brink was aided somewhat by the temporary absence of Nathan Smith due to trip to Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics, he nevertheless became just the second player in program history and the first in 40 years to lead the nation in scoring.\nYoung guns.\nWhile the Pioneers were led by their upper-classmen, four freshmen were making key contributions to the team's success. Carter Mazur and Massimo Rizzo were both clicking along at more than a point-per-game pace while Sean Behrens and Shai Buium aided an already impressive group on the blueline. Each of the four would eventually end up being named to the convergence All-Rookie Team the most ever for one program in a single year.\nBumps in the road.\nDenver ended the regular season with a few blemishes on its record. However, due to the difficulty of their schedule, the Pioneers didn't see any real drop to their rankings and were mathematically guaranteed to make the NCAA tournament before the season was over. The small rough patch allowed North Dakota to catch up to the Pioneers in the conference standings, however, Denver was able to keep in contact with the Hawks and earn a regular season co-championship. Since the Pioneers possessed the tie-breaker, Denver was able to open postseason play against the worst team in the conference, Miami. The 3rd-ranked Pioneers made easy work of the RedHawks, outshooting their opponents 82–47 and riding their power play to two comfortable wins.\nWhen the team travelled north to the less-friendly Xcel Energy Center, the Pioneers saw their scoring dry up entirely. In a tremendous goaltending battle between Chrona and Ryan Fanti, Denver was shutout for the first time on the season and saw their hoped for a conference championship evaporate.\nChampionship run.\nDenver was one of four western teams to receive a #1 seed for the NCAA Tournament. Due to their campus' proximity to the West Regional in Loveland, Colorado, the Pioneers were the only top seed to play any tournament games close to home. Despite the advantage, the team got a tough fight from Massachusetts Lowell in the opening game. The River Hawks opened the scoring and used strong defensive play to keep the game tied well into the third period. After a penalty-filled sequence in the final frame, Denver was able to score twice and take the match 3–2. The regional final gave Denver an opportunity for revenge when it set them against Minnesota Duluth, who had knocked them out of the NCHC tournament. Similar to their prior meeting, the two teams were a match for one another early in the game and the Bulldogs managed to score first. When Cole Guttman tied the game a few minutes later, however, he ended Fanti's shutout streak that had begun more than three games earlier. The goal gave Denver the momentum entering the second but the Pioneers were unable to get another puck past the UMD netminder in the middle frame. The conference rivals remained knotted at 1-all well into the third period when the puck pin-balled around the Duluth cage before Carter Savoie was able to slip it into the cage for the eventual game-winner.\nIn the national semifinal, Denver met one of the championship favorites in Michigan who boasted no less than seven 1st-round draft picks. The high level of talent, however, did not stop the Pioneers from taking over the game for long stretches. The Pioneers played a nearly perfect game, outshooting the Wolverines 33–21 and not taking a single penalty in the match but were still unable to put any distance between the two teams. Denver twice took the lead in the match but Michigan tied the score on both occasions, forcing the two into overtime. 15 minutes into the extra session, the hero of the regional final, Carter Savoie, received a pass from Brink and potted the winner on his own rebound to send Denver to the championship game.\nNational Championship.\nThe final game for the Pioneers came against the top team in the nation, Minnesota State. The Mavericks had been atop the national rankings since mid-January and were one of the top three teams nationally for both offense and defense. In the first two periods, Denver looked outmatched by the veteran lineup and were held scoreless on just 8 shots. Entering the third, the only glimmer of hope for the Pioneers was that they were down by just 1 goal and the team came out flying in the final frame. Ryan Barrow tied the game less than five minutes into the third period and he was soon followed by Michael Benning and Massimo Rizzo. The reversal of fortune was so sudden that Minnesota State seemed unable to get back to their game and the Pioneers carried the play for the remainder of the match. two empty-net goals sealed the game for Denver and the program skated away with its ninth national championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | "

The team represented Ferris State University, was coached by Bob Daniels in his 30th season and played their home games at Ewigleben Arena.\nSeason.\nFerris State joined with six other members of the WCHA to restart the CCHA for the 2021–22 season. Ferris State was eager to leave the previous season behind after posting one of the worst records in the history of college hockey. Straight away, the team's offense looked much better, scoring four goals in each of their first two games and equaling their win total from the previous season after just the first weekend.\nWhile the Bulldogs put up several more wins over the succeeding month, including over #2 Minnesota State, the team was being let down by subpar goaltending. After going through an 8-game losing skid in November, where they surrendered at least 5 goals against on 5 occasions, head coach Bob Daniels knew something had to be done. He was able to lure Noah Giesbrecht from Windsor after the fall semester and the team began to respond to the new netminder. Giesbrecht put together a solid stretch and helped the Bulldogs produce their only weekend sweep of the season, downing Bemidji State in late-January. Giesbrecht would end up sharing the goal with senior Logan Stein by the end of the season and Ferris State ended the year with 11 wins, 10 more than they had all of the previous year.\nThe Bulldogs' goaltenders shone in the postseason, turning aside a barrage of shots from Michigan Tech in both games. While the team managed to push the Huskies into overtime twice, they weren't able to get the final goal on either occasion.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "WrestleMania XL",
        "text": "WrestleMania XL was a 2024 professional wrestling event produced by WWE. It was the 40th annual WrestleMania and took place as a two-night event on April 6 and 7, 2024, at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The event aired via pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming and featured wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. This was the second WrestleMania to be held in both the city of Philadelphia and state of Pennsylvania, after WrestleMania XV in 1999.\nThe card comprised a total of 14 matches, with seven on each night. In the main event for Night 1, The Bloodline (The Rock and Roman Reigns) defeated Cody Rhodes and Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins in a tag team match, which made the stipulation of the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match on Night 2 a Bloodline Rules match. In other prominent matches, Sami Zayn defeated Gunther to win Raw's Intercontinental Championship, ending the latter's record-setting reign at 666 days, and in the opening bout, Rhea Ripley defeated Becky Lynch to retain Raw's Women's World Championship.\nIn the main event for Night 2, Cody Rhodes defeated Roman Reigns in a Bloodline Rules match to win SmackDown's Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, ending the latter's world championship reign at 1,316 days. In other prominent matches, Bayley defeated Iyo Sky to win SmackDown's WWE Women's Championship, Logan Paul defeated Randy Orton and Kevin Owens in a triple threat match to retain SmackDown's United States Championship, and in the opening bout, Drew McIntyre defeated Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins to win Raw's World Heavyweight Championship, after which, Damian Priest cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated McIntyre to win the title.\nThis was the first WrestleMania held after WWE merged with the Endeavor subsidiary Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in September 2023, under the banner of TKO Group Holdings. It was the first WrestleMania under TKO and the first not directly under McMahon family control. It was also the final WrestleMania to livestream on the standalone WWE Network, which is set to close in any markets where the service is still available in January 2025, with WWE content moving to Netflix.\nThe event received highly positive reviews, with Night 2 being singled out for critical acclaim. Praise was given to all seven championship matches, with the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match garnering ubiquitous acclaim for its storytelling and satisfying conclusion.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event, having first been held in 1985. It was the company's first PPV produced and was also WWE's first major event available via livestreaming when the company launched the WWE Network in February 2014. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April, featuring wrestlers from WWE's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. Along with Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, it is one of the company's five biggest events of the year, referred to as the \"Big Five\". WrestleMania was ranked the sixth-most valuable sports brand in the world by \"Forbes\", and has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host WrestleMania. The official theme song for the event was \"Gasoline\" by The Weeknd, which marked the fifth consecutive year that a Weeknd song was used for WrestleMania.\nOn July 27, 2022, it was announced that Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania would host WrestleMania 40 on April 6 and 7, 2024. Philadelphia mayor Jim Kenney welcomed WWE to the city, noting the economic boost from visiting fans. The event's logo was revealed on October 8, 2022, during the Extreme Rules Kickoff pre-show at the nearby Wells Fargo Center. Themed after the Liberty Bell and in the colors of the Philadelphia Eagles, it incorporated Roman numerals for the first time since WrestleMania XXX in 2014, thus officially stylizing the title as WrestleMania XL. Tickets for the event went on sale on August 18, 2023. Over 90,000 tickets were sold on the first day for both nights combined, breaking WWE's record set by the prior year's WrestleMania.\nFrom January 2023, there had been speculation that WWE had been placed up for sale. Hours before WrestleMania 39 Night 2 began, CNBC reported via multiple sources that a deal between WWE and Endeavor, the parent company of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) via Zuffa, was imminent. The deal involved a merger of WWE with the UFC into a new publicly traded company, with Endeavor holding a 51% stake. The sale was confirmed the next day on April 3, 2023, and was finalized on September 12, with WWE merging with the UFC to become divisions of TKO Group Holdings. WrestleMania XL was in turn the first WrestleMania held in which WWE was not owned and controlled by the McMahon family, and subsequently the first WrestleMania under TKO.\nBroadcast outlets.\nWrestleMania XL was broadcast live on traditional pay-per-view worldwide. Additionally, it was available to livestream on Peacock in the United States, Disney+ Hotstar in Indonesia, Disney+ in the Philippines, Binge in Australia, Abema in Japan, SonyLIV in India, and the WWE Network in all other countries. \nAdditionally, the event streamed live on Netflix in New Zealand, as a technical test for when the promotion's new contract with Netflix comes into effect in January 2025. As a result of said contract, all WWE Network content will move to Netflix in all countries where the former is still available as a standalone service, making WrestleMania XL the final WrestleMania event to livestream on the WWE Network.\nOther WrestleMania week events.\nAs part of the WrestleMania festivities, WWE held a number of events throughout the week. WWE Hall of Famer The Undertaker presented his \"1 deadMAN Show\" on Thursday, April 4 at The Fillmore Philadelphia. From that same day through April 8 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, there was a fan convention called WWE World at WrestleMania. In partnership with Fanatics Events, the five-day event included interview panel sessions with WWE wrestlers, a \"WWE 2K24\" gaming tournament, live podcast recordings, meet-and-greets with wrestlers, and a large merchandise store with various memorabilia honoring WrestleMania's 40-year history. WWE World replaced the WrestleMania Fan Axxess event that had been held at each year's WrestleMania prior to WrestleMania 36 in 2020. WWE commentator Pat McAfee also hosted a live edition of his eponymous ESPN afternoon show at WWE World on Friday, April 5.\nThe night before WrestleMania XL on April 5, WWE kicked off WrestleMania Weekend with a special \"WrestleMania Edition\" of \"Friday Night SmackDown\", which featured the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, won by Bronson Reed . Immediately after \"SmackDown\", the 2024 WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony commenced. The afternoon of WrestleMania Saturday, WWE's NXT brand held its annual WrestleMania Week event, Stand &amp; Deliver. WrestleMania Week concluded with the post-WrestleMania edition of \"Monday Night Raw\" on April 8. These events were held live at the nearby Wells Fargo Center.\nBetween all of the WrestleMania Weekend events (\"SmackDown\"/HOF induction ceremony, Stand &amp; Deliver, both nights of WrestleMania XL, and \"Raw\"), WWE announced a grand total attendance of 201,924.\nCelebrities.\nAs is tradition at WrestleMania, celebrities from outside of wrestling participated at the event in various capacities, such as rapper and Philadelphia native Meek Mill, who narrated the cold open for the event on both nights.\nOn Night 1, Grammy Award winning singer Coco Jones opened the show by performing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Grammy winning rapper Lil Wayne debuted his latest single during the event. Philadelphia Eagles offensive linemen Jason Kelce and Lane Johnson were involved in the Rey Mysterio and Andrade vs. Santos Escobar and \"Dirty\" Dominik Mysterio tag team match, aiding Rey and Andrade. \nOn Night 2, Country music duo The War and Treaty performed \"God Bless America\" to open the show. WWE Hall of Famer and rapper Snoop Dogg was on commentary for the Philadelphia Street Fight, and returned later alongside the Philadelphia Eagles cheerleaders to announce the evening's attendance. Rapper and YouTuber IShowSpeed accompanied Logan Paul to the ring for his WWE United States Championship defense (wearing a Prime bottle costume at the start and then revealing himself while the match was in progress).\nStorylines.\nThe event included 14 matches, split evenly between both nights, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nMain event matches.\nAfter Cody Rhodes made his return to WWE at WrestleMania 38 in April 2022, he declared he would finish his story by winning the WWE Championship, a title his father Dusty Rhodes never held. Also at WrestleMania 38, Roman Reigns became the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion by retaining the WWE Universal Championship and winning the WWE Championship. Rhodes won the 2023 Royal Rumble match but failed to defeat Reigns for the undisputed title at WrestleMania 39. Prior to the Royal Rumble at \"Raw\": Day 1 on January 1, The Rock made a surprise appearance and seemingly called out Reigns by asking if he should sit at the \"head of the table\", a reference to their relationship through the Anoaʻi family as for over three years, Reigns had claimed he was the Head of the Table and Tribal Chief of The Bloodline, a faction of wrestlers from the family that includes Reigns and his cousins Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa, managed by Paul Heyman. \nRhodes again won the Royal Rumble match in 2024. With the introduction of the World Heavyweight Championship after WrestleMania 39, Rhodes received a choice of which world title to challenge for at WrestleMania XL. During the Royal Rumble post-event press conference, Rhodes stated that he wanted to face Reigns again for SmackDown's Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, but on the January 29 episode of \"Raw\", Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins argued that Rhodes should instead challenge him for Raw's World Heavyweight Championship. On that week's \"SmackDown\", Rhodes announced that he would not challenge Reigns at WrestleMania and said that one of the individuals he took counsel from in making his decision knew Reigns very well. The Rock then came out and stared down Reigns, with the clear implication that he would be Reign's WrestleMania opponent instead. This decision drew intense fan backlash with the hashtag #WeWantCody trending on social media worldwide, which caused WWE to legitimately pivot their story plans.\nA \"WrestleMania XL Kickoff\" media event was held on February 8 where Reigns and The Rock declared that they would face each other for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship in the main event of WrestleMania XL. However, Rhodes appeared and asserted that since he won the Royal Rumble, he earned the right to decide the main event and announced that he had reversed his decision and would challenge Reigns for the title at WrestleMania. After bringing up each other's families, Rock claimed that he and Rhodes now had issues and he slapped Rhodes in the face, turning heel for the first time since 2003. In the ensuing brawl, Rollins backed Rhodes.\nOn the following \"SmackDown\", WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H affirmed that the main event of WrestleMania XL Night 2 would be Reigns defending the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Rhodes. On the February 12 episode of \"Raw\", Rhodes claimed that it was because of the fans that he reversed his decision and decided to challenge Reigns. Rollins interrupted and stated that he understood Rhodes's decision and offered to be his backup due to Reigns always having his family in his corner. In response on that week's \"SmackDown\", The Rock officially joined The Bloodline and vowed that he would do everything in his power to ensure Rhodes did not finish his story.\nAt on February 24, Rhodes challenged Rock to a one-on-one match at any time, and Rollins again asserted that he would be in Rhodes's corner in facing The Bloodline. On the following \"SmackDown\", Rock rejected Rhodes's challenge and instead offered a counter: a tag team match featuring Rhodes and Rollins against Rock and Reigns in the main event of WrestleMania XL Night 1 with an added stipulation that if Rhodes and Rollins won, then The Bloodline would be barred from ringside during the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match on Night 2, however, if Rock and Reigns won, then the championship match would be contested under The Bloodline's rules in which anything goes. Rhodes and Rollins appeared on the next week's episode where they accepted the challenge.\nUndercard matches.\nAt SummerSlam in July 2022, Bayley made her return from injury alongside Dakota Kai and Iyo Sky with the trio dubbing themselves Damage CTRL. Kairi Sane, who returned to WWE in November 2023 and who had previous issues with Bayley before her departure, forgave Bayley and joined with Damage CTRL, followed by Asuka joining the group, subsequently reuniting The Kabuki Warriors in the process. The group would attain success on SmackDown, including multiple WWE Women's Tag Team Championship reigns, as well as Sky winning the WWE Women's Championship. Bayley then won the 2024 women's Royal Rumble match, thus earning a women's championship match of her choice at WrestleMania XL. Bayley had previously said she would be going after Raw's women's championship so that Damage CTRL would hold all the women's titles of Raw and SmackDown; however, on the February 2 episode of \"SmackDown\", after Bayley overheard Sky, Asuka, and Sane talking behind her back, Bayley revealed she understood Japanese and how they made fun of her. Bayley was then kicked out of Damage CTRL after Asuka and Sane attacked her, turning face for the first time since 2019. After fighting off the rest of Damage CTRL, Bayley decided that she would challenge Sky for the WWE Women's Championship at WrestleMania XL. Kai was absent when Sky, Asuka, and Sane turned on Bayley and although she seemingly sided with Bayley the next week, Kai also turned on her on the March 1 episode. On April 1, the WWE Women's Championship match was confirmed for Night 2.\nConcurrent to their feud with Bayley, Damage CTRL (Iyo Sky, Dakota Kai, Asuka, and Kairi Sane) were also feuding with Naomi and Bianca Belair. On the March 29 episode of \"SmackDown\", following Belair's win over Kai, Damage CTRL engaged in a beatdown of Belair and Naomi. Jade Cargill, who was making her debut as an official roster member of the brand that night, made the save after weeks of teasing a feud with the faction. Later, it was announced that Cargill, Naomi, and Belair would face Damage CTRL (Kai, Asuka, and Sane) in a six-woman tag team match at WrestleMania XL Night 1.\nAs a result of both the men's and women's Royal Rumble match winners choosing to challenge for SmackDown's respective men's and women's world championships at WrestleMania XL, the challengers for Raw's respective men's and women's world championships at the event were decided by Elimination Chamber matches at Elimination Chamber: Perth. Raw's Becky Lynch won the women's eponymous match to face Rhea Ripley for the Women's World Championship, while Raw's Drew McIntyre won the men's to face Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins for the World Heavyweight Championship. The Women's World Championship match was scheduled for Night 1, with the World Heavyweight Championship match set for Night 2. On the March 25 episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that CM Punk, who had issues with both Rollins and McIntyre but had gotten legitimately injured at the Royal Rumble, would serve as a special guest commentator for the World Heavyweight Championship match.\nAfter several wrestlers declared their intentions to challenge Gunther for Raw's Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania XL, Raw General Manager Adam Pearce announced that a gauntlet match would be held on the March 11 episode of \"Raw\" with the winner facing Gunther for the title at WrestleMania. The gauntlet match was won by Sami Zayn, and the Intercontinental Championship match was later confirmed for Night 1.\nOn the March 11 episode of \"Raw\", Raw General Manager Adam Pearce and SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis announced that at WrestleMania XL, The Judgment Day (Finn Bálor and Damian Priest) would defend the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship in a Six-Pack Tag Team Ladder match. Qualifying matches for the five vacant spots—three teams from Raw and two from SmackDown—occurred over the subsequent episodes of \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\". The three teams from Raw were determined by qualifier matches on the March 18 episode of \"Raw\", which were won by #DIY (Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa), The Awesome Truth (The Miz and R-Truth), and The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods). The two teams from SmackDown were determined by two tournament brackets, which were won by A-Town Down Under (Austin Theory and Grayson Waller) and New Catch Republic (Pete Dunne and Tyler Bate) on the March 29 episode of \"SmackDown\". On April 1, the match was confirmed for Night 1, and it was also clarified that both sets of titles under the Undisputed Championship banner (the Raw and SmackDown tag titles) had to be retrieved for the match to end.\nOn the December 15, 2023, episode of \"SmackDown\", AJ Styles made a return from injury and helped LA Knight in fending off The Bloodline, but then turned on Knight and attacked him with a steel chair. Styles later explained that he attacked Knight for taking his spot in a tag team match at Fastlane in October 2023, saying he \"stepped over his dead body\" to get ahead. Both then participated in a fatal four-way match for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble in January 2024, but were unsuccessful. Knight then qualified for the men's Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber: Perth the following month, but Styles did not. During the match itself, Styles snuck into the chamber and attacked Knight with a steel chair, causing Knight to be eliminated. After more weeks of feuding, Knight challenged Styles to a match at WrestleMania XL and Styles accepted, which was later confirmed for Night 2.\nPrior to the summer of 2023, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) were a unit of their family's stable, The Bloodline, on SmackDown. However, due to the manipulations of its leader, Roman Reigns, The Usos left the group which eventually led to a \"Bloodline Civil War\" tag team match at Money in the Bank against Reigns and Solo Sikoa, in which The Usos won. Jey then faced Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at SummerSlam that August, but Jimmy interfered and cost his brother the match. On the following \"SmackDown\", Jimmy explained that he cost Jey the match to keep him from gaining power and becoming corrupted like Reigns. Jey subsequently attacked Jimmy and \"quit\" WWE, but was later reinstated as a member of the Raw roster. Despite being on different shows, Jimmy, who rejoined The Bloodline, would often appear on \"Raw\" and attack Jey or cost him matches. The two would also face off in the men's Royal Rumble match in January 2024 as the first two entrants. Jimmy then cost Jey a match for the Intercontinental Championship the following month. On the March 11 episode of \"Raw\", fed up with his brother's actions, Jey challenged Jimmy to a match at WrestleMania XL, which Jimmy accepted on that week's \"SmackDown\". The match was later confirmed for Night 1.\nAt the Royal Rumble, Logan Paul defeated Kevin Owens by disqualification to retain SmackDown's United States Championship. Paul had attempted to use his signature brass knuckles, but Owens instead used them and was caught, thus was disqualified. The following month at Elimination Chamber: Perth, Paul, Owens, and Randy Orton were participants in the men's Elimination Chamber match. Orton eliminated both Owens and Paul, who in turn caused Orton to be eliminated by punching him with the brass knuckles. On the March 8 episode of \"SmackDown\", Paul and his business partner KSI announced that their energy drink company, Prime, would be an official WWE sponsor with the Prime logo placed in the center of the ring mat for PPV and livestreaming events, in turn becoming WWE's first center ring mat sponsor. Orton interrupted and attempted an RKO on Paul, but Paul escaped with KSI instead receiving the RKO. The following week, SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis announced that Paul would defend the United States Championship against Owens and Orton in a triple threat match at WrestleMania XL, which was later confirmed for Night 2.\nAt Crown Jewel in November 2023, Rey Mysterio lost the United States Championship to Logan Paul after his Latino World Order (LWO) stablemate, Santos Escobar, left Paul's signature brass knuckles on the ring apron, allowing Paul to hit Rey with them and win the title. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", fellow LWO member Carlito accused Escobar of intentionally leaving the brass knuckles on the ring apron. Later that night, Escobar attacked Rey as he was checking on Carlito, injuring Rey's left knee and striking it with steel steps, turning heel and defecting from the LWO. After a three-month hiatus, Rey returned on the March 1 episode of \"SmackDown\" to help Carlito defeat Escobar in a street fight. Three weeks later, Escobar defeated Rey after interference from the latter's son, \"Dirty\" Dominik Mysterio, who had turned on his father at Clash at the Castle in September 2022 to join The Judgment Day. One week later, Escobar and his Legado Del Fantasma stablemates thanked Dominik for his actions. Rey interrupted, introduced Dragon Lee as the newest member of the LWO, and Rey and Lee subsequently challenged Escobar and Dominik to a tag team match at WrestleMania XL, which was made official for Night 1. The following week, however, Lee was attacked backstage, rendering him unable to compete at WrestleMania. Andrade, who assisted Rey in fending off Escobar and Dominik earlier that night and reunited with LWO's Zelina Vega, was named Lee's replacement.\nAt \"SmackDown\": New Year's Revolution on January 5, Karrion Kross, accompanied by Scarlett, attacked The Pride (Bobby Lashley, Angelo Dawkins, and Montez Ford) with help from the returning Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar), accompanied by Paul Ellering, with Kross, Scarlett, Authors of Pain, and Ellering forming a faction called The Final Testament. The two groups would continue feuding over the next couple of months and on the March 29 episode of \"SmackDown\", The Final Testament attacked Lashley and B-Fab backstage, causing a distraction that cost The Street Profits (Dawkins and Ford) their tournament final match to qualify for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship match at WrestleMania XL. On April 1, a six-man tag team Philadelphia Street Fight pitting The Final Testament against The Pride was confirmed for WrestleMania XL Night 2.\nCancelled matches.\nBrock Lesnar, who last appeared at SummerSlam in August 2023, was planned to return at the Royal Rumble and be featured in a match at WrestleMania XL, reportedly against Gunther. However, due to Lesnar being referenced in a sex trafficking lawsuit against Vince McMahon, Lesnar was pulled from the Royal Rumble and all planned storylines for him leading into WrestleMania were scrapped.\nCM Punk, who after nearly 10 years made his return to WWE at in November 2023, legitimately tore his right triceps during the men's Royal Rumble match. It was reported that his planned WrestleMania XL match was to challenge Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins for Raw's World Heavyweight Championship, but due to his injury, plans were changed.\nEvent.\nNight 1.\nPreliminary matches.\nWrestleMania Saturday began with WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H welcoming and hyping up the fans for the event.\nIn the first match, Rhea Ripley defended the Women World's Championship against Becky Lynch. During the match, Lynch performed a leg drop on Ripley, sending her out of the ring and a Beck-sploder on Ripley at ringside. Lynch applied the Dis-arm-her on Ripley, who escaped by performing three sit-out powerbombs on Lynch for a nearfall. Lynch attempted another leg drop on Ripley, who countered into a Prison Trap submission maneuver, however, Lynch escaped. As Ripley attempted the Riptide, Lynch countered into a Manhandle Slam on Ripley for a nearfall. Ripley performed a Riptide on Lynch for a nearfall. Lynch applied the Dis-Arm-Her on Ripley, which sent both of the ring and Ripley a powerbomb on Lynch to escape. Ripley performed a frog splash on Lynch for a near fall. In the closing moments, as Lynch attempted a second Manhandle Slam, Ripley countered and performed two Riptides on Lynch to retain the title.\nNext, The Judgment Day (Finn Bálor and Damian Priest) defended the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship in a Six-Pack Tag Team Ladder match against #DIY (Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa), The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods), The Awesome Truth (The Miz and R-Truth), A-Town Down Under (Austin Theory and Grayson Waller), and New Catch Republic (Pete Dunne and Tyler Bate) in which both sets of titles had to be retrieved for the match to end. During the match, Truth performed the Attitude Adjustment on Bálor and pinned him for a three count. Truth celebrated, thinking it was a traditional tag team match, however, Miz had informed Truth that they had to unhook the title belts down to win them. Truth then suggested that #DIY go after the Raw Tag Team Championship, while he and Miz go after the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. The two teams were then knocked down by A-Town Down Under, who climbed the ladder and retrieved the SmackDown titles to become the new SmackDown Tag Team Champions. New Catch Republic then sent Waller crashing through ladders outside the ring. #DIY then set two tables next to each other at ringside. Judgment Day member JD McDonagh ascended the ladder to unhook the belts, however, The New Day tipped over the ladder, causing McDonagh to crash through the tables. In the end, Truth performed another Attitude Adjustment on Priest over the top rope to the floor. Truth then ascended the ladder and unhooked the Raw titles to win them, concluding the match as well as ending the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship with the two titles now separated. This made Truth the oldest Raw Tag Team Champion in the title's history and marked his first win at WrestleMania.\nAfter that, Rey Mysterio and Andrade (accompanied by Rey's LWO stablemates Carlito, Cruz Del Toro, Joaquin Wilde, and Zelina Vega) faced Santos Escobar and \"Dirty\" Dominik Mysterio (accompanied by Escobar's Legado del Fantasma stablemates Angel, Berto, and Elektra Lopez). In the end, two masked men incapacitated Dominik, and Rey then performed a 619 on Dominik and Escobar. Andrade performed a piledriver on Dominik and Rey performed a frog splash on Escobar to win the match. Following the match, the masked men, who were revealed as Philadelphia Eagles offensive linemen Jason Kelce and Lane Johnson, celebrated with the LWO. \nIn the fourth match, Jey Uso faced his brother Jimmy Uso in only the third-ever real life brother vs. brother match at WrestleMania (after Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart at WrestleMania X in March 1994 and Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy at WrestleMania 25 in April 2009). Before the match officially began, the two brawled at ringside. During the match, Jey and Jimmy traded multiple superkicks against each other. As Jey attempted a superkick on Jimmy, Jimmy pleaded forgiveness to Jey with Jimmy feigning an apology. After Jimmy offered a handshake to Jey, the latter shook his brother's hand and embraced him, however, Jimmy responded with a super kick to Jey. Jimmy then performed the Frog Splash on Jey for a nearfall. In the end, Jey performed a Spear and Uso Splash on Jimmy to win the match.\nNext, Jade Cargill, Bianca Belair, and Naomi faced off against Damage CTRL (Dakota Kai, Asuka, and Kairi Sane) in a six-woman tag team match. In the end, Asuka accidentally spit mist in Sane's face, allowing Belair to whip Asuka with her ponytail and followed up with the KOD. Cargill then performed the Jaded on Kai to win the match.\nIn the penultimate match, Gunther defended the Intercontinental Championship against Sami Zayn. As Zayn charged for the Helluva Kick, Gunther countered into a sleeper hold submission. Zayn escaped and attempted the Blue Thunder Bomb, but Gunther countered again and applied another sleeper hold. Gunther performed a dropkick and powerbomb on Zayn for a nearfall. Gunther executed multiple powerbombs, but Zayn kicked out. Gunther started mocking Zayn's wife, who was seated in the front row and performed multiple top rope splashes on Zayn. As Gunther climbed the top rope, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick and Brainbuster on Gunther on the top turnbuckle. Zayn then followed up with two consecutive Helluva Kicks and pinned Gunther to win the title for a fourth time, ending Gunther's 666 day reign as champion.\nMain event.\nIn the main event of Night 1, The Bloodline (The Rock and Roman Reigns, accompanied by Paul Heyman) faced Cody Rhodes and Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins in a match where if Rhodes and Rollins won, all members of The Bloodline would be barred from ringside during the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match between Reigns and Rhodes on Night 2, but if Rock and Reigns won, then the championship match would be held under Bloodline Rules. While Rock and Rollins were fighting outside the ring, Rock warned referee Chad Patton that he would fire him if there was a countout. As Reigns tagged in Rock, Rock performed a low blow on Rollins. Patton apologized to Rhodes as there was nothing he could do about it. Rock applied the Sharpshooter on Rollins, in which Rhodes broke it up by slapping Rock in the face. As Reigns' nose was bleeding, he attempted the Spear on Rhodes, who countered and performed a Sunset Flip for a nearfall. Rhodes performed the Cody Cutter and Rollins followed up with a frog splash on Reigns for a nearfall. Rollins performed a second Stomp on Reigns, in which Rhodes followed up with the Cross Rhodes. Rhodes went for the pin, but Rock pulled the referee out of the ring. Reigns recovered and hit Rhodes from behind with a low blow and a Spear. Rock rolled the referee back inside the ring for a nearfall. Outside the ring, Rock grabbed the weight belt with Rhodes' blood on it and taunted Rhodes' mother, who was seated at ringside. Back in the ring, Rock attempted the People's Elbow, but Rhodes countered with the Cody Cutter. Reigns attempted the Spear on Rhodes, who was pushed out of the way by Rollins, causing Reigns to accidentally spear Rock. Rhodes and Rollins performed simultaneous Pedigrees on Rock and Reigns for a nearfall. Outside the ring, Rhodes performed the Rock Bottom on Rock through the broadcast table, while Reigns speared Rollins through the barricade. Back in the ring, as Rhodes attempted a third consecutive Cross Rhodes on Reigns, Rock whipped Rhodes with the weight belt, allowing Reigns to perform the Spear on Rhodes. Reigns tagged in Rock, who performed the People's Elbow on Rhodes and pinned him to win the match, making the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match on Night 2 to be held under Bloodline Rules. This match was the second longest in WrestleMania history (after Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania XII in March 1996).\nNight 2.\nPreliminary matches.\nWrestleMania Sunday began with a returning Stephanie McMahon hyping up the crowd for the event.\nIn the first match, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Drew McIntyre, with CM Punk as a special guest commentator. Immediately at the beginning of the match, McIntyre performed the Claymore Kick on Rollins for a nearfall. Outside the ring, McIntyre grabbed a cellphone and took a selfie with his wife. Following this, Rollins performed the Pedigree on McIntyre. The latter beat the count, but as he went back into the ring, Rollins immediately performed the Stomp for a nearfall. McIntyre turned his attention to Punk and mocked him by signaling for his finisher, the GTS, but Rollins countered into an inside cradle for a nearfall. McIntyre then performed another Claymore Kick on Rollins for a nearfall. In the climax, as Rollins kicked out of another Claymore Kick, McIntyre hit him with the maneuver again and pinned him to finally win a WWE world title in front of a live crowd.\nAfter the match, McIntyre mocked Punk and gestured a crotch chop. Punk stood up and tripped McIntyre. Punk then removed the brace from his arm and hit McIntyre with it. 2023 Men's Money in the Bank winner Damian Priest then ran out to the ring with his briefcase and cashed in the contract. Priest immediately performed the South of Heaven on McIntyre and pinned him to win the title. This made him the first WWE world champion of Puerto Rican descent in over fifty years and only the second WWE world champion of Puerto Rican descent after Pedro Morales. This also made him the second person to cash in his briefcase at WrestleMania (after Rollins at WrestleMania 31 in 2015).\nNext, The Pride (Bobby Lashley, Angelo Dawkins, and Montez Ford, accompanied by B-Fab) faced The Final Testament (Karrion Kross, Akam, and Rezar, accompanied by Scarlett and Paul Ellering) in a Philadelphia Street Fight match. WWE Hall of Famer and rapper Snoop Dogg was the special guest commentator for the match, and WWE Hall of Famer Bubba Ray Dudley was introduced as the special guest referee. In the end, Kross bickered with Dudley and shoved him. Dudley then pulled out his Hansen Brothers glasses and put them on and then signaled to \"Get The Tables\". Ford and Dawkins grabbed a table and set it up inside the ring. Ford then performed a Frog Splash on Kross through the table. Lashley then pinned Kross to win the match. After the match, Snoop Dogg joined The Pride and Dudley inside the ring and celebrated with them.\nAfter that, LA Knight faced AJ Styles. Before the match began, Knight and Styles ensued in a brawl. As Knight went for a superplex, Styles slipped under him and tripped him, causing Knight's head to hit the top turnbuckle pad. In the climax, Styles attempted the Phenomenal Forearm on Knight, who countered and performed the Blunt Force Trauma on Styles and pinned him to win his WrestleMania debut.\nIn the next match, Logan Paul (accompanied by the Prime energy drink mascot) defended the United States Championship against Randy Orton and Kevin Owens. Throughout the match, Orton and Owens double-teamed Paul. As Orton and Owens attempted to pin Paul, both men traded punches to each other, giving Paul the opportunity to roll outside. Owens attempted the Stunner on Orton, only for the latter to counter into the RKO for a nearfall. Paul then hit Orton with his brass knuckles for a nearfall. Orton set up for the Punt Kick, but the Prime mascot pulled Paul outside the ring and revealed himself as IShowSpeed. Orton then performed the RKO on IShowSpeed through the announce table. Back in the ring, Orton countered Owens' Pop-Up Powerbomb attempt into the RKO. Paul then threw Orton out of the ring and performed the Frog Splash on Owens and pinned him to retain the title.\nIn the penultimate match, Iyo Sky defended the WWE Women's Championship against Bayley. During the match, Sky performed two consecutive bridge suplexes on Bayley for a nearfall. Sky applied the STF and transitioned into a crossface, in which Bayley escaped and performed the Bayley to Belly on Sky for a nearfall. Sky performed an Over The Moonsault, but Bayley kicked out. After hitting Sky with an elbow drop, Bayley performed the Rose Plant and pinned Sky to win the title for a second time.\nMain event.\nIn the main event of Night 2, Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship in a Bloodline Rules match against Cody Rhodes. During the match, Reigns and Rhodes fought into the crowd, where Rhodes suplexed Reigns on a table. Back in the ring, Reigns performed a back suplex and a fisherman's suplex on Rhodes for nearfalls. Outside the ring, Reigns performed a low blow on Rhodes before powerbombing him through an announce table. The two continued to fight back in the ring, where Rhodes performed the Cross Rhodes on Reigns, but as he attempted a second, Jimmy Uso attacked Rhodes. However, Jey Uso ran in. The two fought up the entrance ramp and Jey speared Jimmy off the ramp through tables. Reigns applied the guillotine choke, but Rhodes forced himself and Reigns out of the ring, where Rhodes speared Reigns through the barricade. Much like the previous year's WrestleMania, Rhodes performed the Cross Rhodes on Reigns twice, only for Solo Sikoa to appear and perform a Samoan Spike on Rhodes just before the third attempt.\nHowever, even after a Samoan Spike/Spear combination by Sikoa and Reigns, Rhodes kicked out. John Cena, who had his own issues with The Bloodline, then ran down to and hit Attitude Adjustments on both Sikoa and Reigns. The Rock appeared and after a stare-down with his old rival, performed a Rock Bottom on Cena. The Shield's music then hit, and Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, who was wearing the stable's old gear, arrived with a chair, but before he could hit Rock with it, he was taken out by Reigns with a Superman Punch. Rock was about to attack Rhodes with the weight belt, but The Undertaker then appeared and took out Rock with a chokeslam. With chaos unfolding around the ring, Reigns had the opportunity to take out Rhodes with a chair, but instead decided to hit Rollins in the back with the chair (as deliberate revenge for Rollins betraying Reigns in the same way that caused the Shield's breakup 10 years prior) before throwing it away. Reigns attempted to spear Rhodes, but Rhodes countered the move and hit three successive Cross Rhodes and then pinned Reigns to finish his story of becoming WWE Champion, and also ending Reigns' 1,316 day reign as Universal Champion, the fourth longest world championship reign in WWE history. After the match, Rhodes celebrated with many main roster wrestlers and WWE legends, as well as his family.\nReception.\nThe Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match between Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes was universally praised. Wade Keller of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" called it \"a mega-spectacle of a match\", stating that the only downfall was that the near falls before the slew of interferences occurred \"didn't really resonate as possible finishes since the Bloodline Rules advantage hadn't come into play yet\", but \"once it did, it delivered huge pops\". Keller stated that he \"loved the idea of other top babyfaces celebrating with Cody, as Dusty Rhodes did that when he won NWA World Titles\". \nChris Mueller of \"Bleacher Report\" and Brent Brookhouse of \"CBS Sports\" called it \"overbooked in the best way\". Brookhouse stated that there was a \"plodding\" beginning because \"everyone knew the mess of interference\" from The Bloodline would be coming, and that \"Rhodes getting help from Jey Uso, Cena, Rollins and Undertaker was the kind of wild mess that only makes sense at WrestleMania\". \nPhilip Sledge of Cinemablend described the match, and the appearances by The Rock, John Cena, and The Undertaker, as being WWE's \"\"\" moment\"."

        "text": "The 2021–22 UMass Lowell River Hawks Men's ice hockey season was the 55th season of play for the program, the 39th season competing at the Division I level, and the 38th season in the Hockey East conference. The River Hawks represented the University of Massachusetts Lowell and were coached by Norm Bazin, in his 11th season.\nSeason.\nLowell got off to a great start to their season, going nine consecutive games without a loss that included four wins against ranked teams. The primary reason for the early success was from the River Hawks' defense, particularly the stellar goaltending from Owen Savory. By the end of November, Savory was among the national leaders with 1.10 goals against average and 3 shutouts through just 9 games. The hot start earned Lowell its way into the national rankings and put them on the bubble of a potential NCAA bid.\nThe River Hawks had their first losing weekend of the season in early December, however, because it came against the defending national champions, they weren't harmed by the results too badly. The team responded by winning each of their next five games despite taking over a month to complete that stretch. Their lofty win total put UMass Lowell into the top 10 in late January and had them on the cusp of being a shoe-in for the national tournament. Unfortunately, the River Hawks' lack of offense began to catch up with them in the second half of the season.\nOver a period of about a month, from late-January to late-February, Lowell went 4–6. The team could manage more than 3 goals in just one of those games and that came against Dartmouth, one of the worst teams in the nation. The defense performed well but not nearly as stout as they had in the first half of the year. The only saving grace for the Hawks was that most of the losses were to ranked teams and did not send them plummeting down the PairWise rankings. Lowell recovered at the end of the regular season, sweeping their weekend finale and lifting themselves back into the #15 spot where they at least had a chance to make a tournament bid.\nPostseason.\nFor finishing 2nd (tied) in the conference standings, Lowell received a bye into the quarterfinals and were set against a fairly surprising Merrimack squad. The Hawks ended up producing their best offensive effort of the season and trounced the Warriors 7–2. The win pushed the team two spots higher in the rankings and gave them a more comfortable position for a tournament bid. In the semifinal round, Lowell faced off against Massachusetts. A win would not only send them to the conference championship but would likely guarantee the Hawks a tournament bid. The defense was again a strength, limiting the Minutemen to just 19 shots, but Lowell could not get on track offensively and ended up losing 1–3. Fortunately, because several underdog teams lost in the semifinal round, Lowel's position as the #13 team was assured an appearance in the NCAA tournament.\nThe River Hawks played in their first tournament in five years and opened against Denver, the #3 overall seed. Lucas Condotta got the Hawks on the board first and the team seemed to carry the balance of play, though they couldn't stop the Pioneers from tying the game near the end of the period. Lowell managed to kill of three separate penalties in the middle frame, a solid achievement against one of the strongest power plays in the nation. All that work, however, kept the Hawks on the defensive and Denver pressed Savory hard. Mid-way through the third, they finally got their first lead of the game on a shot from Carter Savoie. The River Hawks didn't surrender and immediately set about tying the game once more. In less than five minutes, Connor Sodergren netted the River Hawks' second goal and gave hope that Lowell could pull off the upset in front of the partisan crowd. With just under three minutes to play, Cameron Wright deflected a puck out of mid-air through Savory and took all the momentum away from the Hawks. In spite of a furious charge to get a third goal, Lowell ran out of time and their season came to a close.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Manawatu Cricket Association was formed in 1895, made up of six clubs: Feilding, Palmerston North, Colyton, Carnarvon, Cheltenham and Birmingham. \nManawatu played in the very first match in the Hawke Cup, when they defeated Wairarapa in December 1910, thanks largely to the bowling of Arthur Ongley, who took 12 wickets. They have held the Hawke Cup nine times, the first time from February 1928 to March 1930, and most recently from February 2014 to February 2015. They also held the trophy between December 1934 and February 1938, and between January 1940 and April 1947.\nManawatu is one of the eight district associations that make up Central Districts, which competes in the first-class Plunket Shield, the 50-over Ford Trophy and the T20 Super Smash. When Central Districts played their first first-class match in December 1950, they were captained by Manawatu's Joe Ongley.\nIn 2021, to mark the 125th anniversary of the Manawatu Cricket Association, two former Central Districts and Manawatū players, Murray Brown and Alec Astle, wrote \"125 Not Out\", the Association's official history.\nSenior teams.\nThe clubs that compete at senior level in the Manawatu Cricket Association are Bloomfield, Dannevirke HS, Dannevirke SC, Feilding, Freyberg, Manawatu-Foxton, Marist, Maw Haws, Old Boys, Palmerston, Palmerston North BHS, United and Wanderers."

        "text": "The 2021–22 Mercyhurst Lakers men's ice hockey season was the 35th season of play for the program, the 23rd at the Division I level, and the 19th season in the Atlantic Hockey conference. The Lakers represented Mercyhurst University and were coached by Rick Gotkin, in his 34th season.\nSeason.\nMercyhurst was hoping to build on an improvement in 2021 with a strong start to their season. Early returns were mixed as the team tied four of their first eight games. Defense was an issue as the Mercyhurst goal was consistently harassed by their opponents to the tune of nearly 34 shots a game. While the team had Hank Johnson and Kyle McClellan share the starting role, neither was able to shine against the constant barrage. The Lakers nearly pulled themselves back up to .500 at the end of November when they earned a surprising split with Ohio State and there was some hope that the team was ready to turn a corner.\nUnfortunately, the defensive performance got even worse afterwards and Mercyhurst went 1–10 in their next eleven matches. In that stretch the Lakers allowed no fewer than 3 goals a game and, even when the offense had a good night, their two netminders couldn't keep the puck out of the net.\nBy the middle of January, the team was at the bottom of the Atlantic Hockey standings and it looked like the Lakers would have to wait for another year. However, Rick Gotkin decided to put his trust in McClellan as the team's starter and the sophomore began to respond with stellar performances by the end of the month. Seemingly overnight, Mercyhurst went from allowing 5 goals a game to surrendering 1. Mercyhurst arrested their downward descent and started winning games, the most surprising coming against conference-leader, American International in mid-February.\nThe winning came too late for Mercyhurst to finish any higher than 7th, but it did grant the Lakers home ice advantage in the first round of the conference tournament. McLellan continued to be called upon to save the team's season and he responded with two sterling efforts, winning consecutive 2–1 games while stopping 71 shots. McLellan then backstopped Mercyhurst to an upset over the #2 seed, Canisius; while he got a bit more help from the Laker offense in terms of shots, he still needed to make every save as both games were essentially 2–1 matches (Mercyhurst scored an empty-net goal in the second game).\nMercyhurst managed to lift itself into the conference semifinal and continued to play strong, putting a scare into American International. The Lakers twice took the lead in the game but a hat-trick from AIC's Blake Bennett erased both leads. The Lakers were forced to pull McLellan to try and tie the game but the Yellow Jackets ended up netting a 5th goal as a result. That marker proved critical after Mercyhurst answered with 80 seconds to play but they could not even the score and saw their tremendous postseason run end.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2021–22 Merrimack Warriors Men's ice hockey season was the 67th season of play for the program, the 33rd at the Division I level, and the 33rd season in the Hockey East conference. The Warriors represented Merrimack College and were coached by Scott Borek, in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nMerrimack entered the season having posted losing records in each of the previous nine seasons. Early in the season it appeared that trend would continue when the Warriors lost four consecutive games and then turned to a freshman goaltender to try and salvage their season. Hugo Ollas had a bit of a rough go at first, but he helped stabilize the back end for Merrimack and enabled the team to play .500 hockey in November and December.\nWhile their record was still under water, the team had a bigger problem to contend with after returning from the winter break. A pair of games against Clarkson and St. Lawrence were cancelled due to COVID-19. Bentley was swiftly added to the schedule and kicked off a 5-game winning streak that saw Merrimack score four victories over ranked teams.\nThe quality wins earned the Warriors the first appearance in the national rankings in years and made it possible for their supporters to hope for a tournament bid. Their time in the top 20 was short-lived and Merrick lost their very next game. The team flirted with the rankings for most of the remainder of the season, but sweep at the hands of Northeastern in the regular season finale ended any chance of an at-large bid.\nEntering the postseason, Merrimack knew they would likely have to win the Hockey East championship in order to make the NCAA tournament. After a solid win over Maine in the opening round, the Warriors travelled to Lowell to take on the River Hawks. Despite outshooting their opponents, Ollas and Borgiel combined to allow 7 goals and the Warriors were drubbed out of contention. Regardless of the sour end, this was the most successful season for the program in a decade and was Scott Borek's best season behind the bench since 1997.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The series was the conclusion of the 2021 Overwatch League playoffs and was played between the Shanghai Dragons and the Atlanta Reign. The final was originally planned to be played at the Galen Center in Los Angeles, California; however, due to increasing threat of COVID-19 and the delta variant, the match was shifted to be played online.\nShanghai qualified for the season playoffs as the top seed and defeated the San Francisco Shock, Los Angeles Gladiators, and Dallas Fuel all in the upper bracket of the tournament. Atlanta qualified as the fifth seed and was defeated in the first round by the Chengdu Hunters but went on to defeat the Washington Justice, Los Angeles Gladiators, San Francisco Shock, and Dallas Fuel in the lower bracket.\nIn the Grand Finals match, the Dragons swept the Reign by a score of 4–0 to win their first OWL championship.\nRoad to the Grand Finals.\nThe Grand Finals are the post-season championship series of the Overwatch League (OWL), a professional international esports league; the teams in the 2021 Grand Finals match competed for a $2.2 million prize pool, where the winners received $1.5 million. The 2021 season was the fourth season in OWL history and consisted of twenty teams. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, most regular season and midseason tournament matches were played online. The playoffs was contested by eight teams – five from the league's West region and three from the league's East region.\nThe finalists, the Atlanta Reign and the Shanghai Dragons, finished the 2021 regular season with records of and , respectively. The Dragons claimed the top seed in the season playoffs, while the Reign entered as the fifth seed. The two teams faced each other twice throughout the 2021 season – in the June Joust and Summer Showdown tournaments. Both times, the Dragons defeated the Reign by a score of 3–0. The defending OWL champions, the San Francisco Shock, were eliminated in the third round of the lower bracket of the season playoffs, while the 2020 runners-up, the Seoul Dynasty, failed to qualify for the 2021 playoffs after being eliminated in the play-in tournament.\nAtlanta Reign.\nThe Reign joined the league in 2019 as one of eight expansion teams. After a mediocre 2020 season, the Reign elected to not re-sign all six of their free agents in the offseason, which included damage players Garrett \"Saucy\" Roland and Joon \"Erster\" Jeong, tank players Park \"Pokpo\" Hyun-jun and Nathan \"frd\" Goebel, and support players Dusttin \"Dogman\" Bowerman and Anthony \"Fire\" King. Additionally, the team released damage player Hugo \"SharP\" Sahlberg. Atlanta signed two players in the offseason: damage players Oh \"Pelican\" Se-hyun and Kai \"Kai\" Collins.\nThe Reign began their 2021 season with a loss to Florida Mayhem in the May Melee qualifiers. After going 1–3 in the May Melee qualifiers, the Reign failed to the regional knockouts. The team found success in the following tournament cycle, the June Joust; after going 3–1 in the qualifiers, the Reign defeated the San Francisco Shock in the regional knockout finals to advance to the June Joust tournament. However, the team lost in the lower bracket finals to the Dragons by a 0–3 scoreline. Atlanta found similar results in the Summer Showdown, defeating the Los Angeles Gladiators in the regional finals to advance to their second consecutive midseason tournament. The Reign ultimately fell in the first round of the lower bracket in a 2–3 loss to the Dallas Fuel. In the final tournament cycle, the Countdown Cup, the Reign qualified for their third consecutive tournament appearance. However, Reign rookie Oh \"Pelican\" Se-hyun suffered a collapsed lung prior to the tournament. Atlanta fell in the tournament to the Chengdu Hunters by a score of 0–3. The team finished the regular season with 11 wins, 5 losses, 13 league points, and the fifth seed in the season playoffs. Oh \"Pelican\" Se-hyun was awarded the league's Rookie of the Year award and was an MVP candidate for the 2021 regular season.\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Reign fell to the third-seeded Chengdu Hunters, 2–3, sending Atlanta to the lower bracket of the tournament. Atlanta ran through the lower bracket, defeating the eighth-seeded Washington Justice, 3–0, the fourth-seeded Los Angeles Gladiators, 3–2 the sixth-seeded San Francisco Shock, 3–1, and the second-seeded Dallas Fuel, 3–1.\nShanghai Dragons.\nThe Shanghai Dragons entered the league in 2018 as one of the twelve founding franchises. In the offseason preceding the 2021 season, the team made several roster changes. The team elected not to re-sign all five of their free agents: damage players Yang \"Dding\" Jin-hyeok, Lu \"Diya\" Weida, and Bae \"Diem\" Min-seong, tank player Kim \"Geguri\" Se-yeon, and support player Yang \"Luffy\" Sung-hyeon, although Diem was signed back to the team later in the offseason. Additionally, the Dragons transferred tank player Lee \"Fearless\" Eui-seok to the Dallas Fuel, and released tank player Seo \"Stand1\" Ji-won. Additions to the team included tank player Koo \"Fate\" Pan-seung, who was acquired from the Florida Mayhem, damage player Jeong \"Erster\" Jun, and support player He \"Molly\" Chengzhi.\nThe Dragons' first match of the 2021 season resulted in a win over the Guangzhou Charge in the May Melee qualifiers. After defeating the Philadelphia Fusion in the Eastern regional knockouts, the Dragons entered the May Melee tournament, the first of four midseason double-elimination tournaments in the regular season, as the second-seeded Eastern team. The team fell to the Dallas Fuel in the upper bracket finals, dropping them to the lower bracket of the tournament; the Dragons reached the finals of the tournament through the lower bracket, where they once again lost to the Fuel. Prior to the start of the June Joust qualifiers, damage player Joon \"Erster\" Jeong retired. Looking to add depth to their roster, the Dragons signed damage player Lee \"WhoRU\" Seung-jun several days later. The team won three of their four June Joust qualifying matches to advance them to the regional knockouts. Several days before the knockouts began, the Dragons lost another player to retirement in damage player Bae \"Diem\" Min-seong; once again looking for depth, the team signed damage player Chae \"Develop\" Rak-hoon shortly afterwards. The Dragons advanced to the June Joust tournament after defeating the Seoul Dynasty in the regional knockouts. The team lost their first match of the tournament, again to the Fuel; however, after making it to the finals through the lower bracket, the Dragons defeated the Fuel to claim their first title of the 2021 season. The Dragons continued their success throughout the Summer Showdown, winning all four of their qualifying matches and advancing past the regional qualifiers. Prior to the start of the Summer Showdown tournament, the team added former Dragons player Kim \"Daemin\" Dae-min as a coach. The Dragons went undefeated in the tournament, and after defeating the Chengdu Hunters in the finals, they claimed their second consecutive midseason tournament title. In the final tournament cycle of the regular season, the Countdown Cup, the Dragons went 2–2 in the qualifiers, failing to advance to the regional knockouts for the first time in the season; Dragons' head coach Moon \"Moon\" Byung-chul stated that they were \"resting\" their players during the tournament cycle.

The Beavers were led by eighth-year head coach Wayne Tinkle, and played their home games at Gill Coliseum in Corvallis, Oregon as members of the Pac-12 Conference. They finished the season 3–28, 1–19 in Pac-12 play to finish in last place. They lost to Oregon in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament.\nPrevious season.\nIn a season limited due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Beavers finished the 2020–21 season 20–13, 10–10 in Pac-12 play to finish in sixth place.\nDespite being picked to finish last in the Pac-12 standings in preseason media polls, the Beavers finished tied for sixth in conference play and received a 5-seed in the Pac-12 tournament due to Arizona's self-imposed ban. Despite the Beavers' outperforming of low expectations, the consensus among analysts entering the Pac-12 tournament was that OSU would not receive an at-large bid to the upcoming NCAA tournament, and thus needed to win the conference tournament to make the field as an automatic qualifier. The Beavers proceeded to defeat 4-seed UCLA in overtime, top-seed and rival Oregon, and 3-seed Colorado in succession to win their first Pac-12 tournament title in school history and guarantee just their second NCAA tournament berth since 1990.\nSeeded 12th in the Midwest region in the 2021 NCAA tournament, the Beavers would trail for less than five combined minutes in upset wins over 5th-seeded Tennessee and 4th-seeded Oklahoma State to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. The wins were Oregon State's first in the NCAA tournament since advancing to the Elite Eight in 1982. The Beavers next overcame a slow start to defeat 8-seed Loyola-Chicago and advance to the Elite Eight, matching their 1982 run. Over their six-game postseason winning streak dating back to the Pac-12 tournament, the Beavers were not favored in a single game. They became just the second ever 12-seed to advance to the Elite Eight since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.\nFacing the 2-seed Houston Cougars in the Midwest regional final, the Beavers rallied from a 17-point second half deficit to tie the game with under four minutes remaining.

        "text": "Grant Morgan (born January 23, 1998) is an American football coach for the Illinois Fighting Illini. He played college football for the Arkansas Razorbacks. Originally a preferred walk-on with the team, he was placed on full scholarship in August 2018. He has since been named to multiple All-America and All-SEC teams, and has served as a team captain for the Razorbacks in 2020 and 2021. He has twice been named a Burlsworth Trophy finalist, and signed a Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) deal with Walk-On's Bistreaux and Bar in August 2021.\nEarly life.\nGrant Morgan, the son of Matt Morgan and Annie Shaw, was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on January 23, 1998. He was a three-year letterwinner at Greenwood High School, where he was rated the No. 22 prospect in Arkansas and the No. 71 inside linebacker in his class by 247Sports and given an overall three-star rating. During his senior year, he was named Defensive Player of the Year by the \"Arkansas Democrat-Gazette\" and Player of the Year by the \"Southwest Times Record\". Greenwood made the second round of the AAA football playoffs in Morgan's junior year and won the state championship in his senior year.\nMorgan accepted a position as a preferred walk-on at Arkansas on January 18, 2016, one day after his unofficial visit to the campus. He chose Arkansas over his other interests, Arkansas State, Auburn, Central Arkansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, and Tulsa, though he did not receive offers from any of these schools. Morgan formally enrolled at Arkansas on May 31, 2016.\nCollege career.\nAfter redshirting during the 2016 season, Morgan saw the field for the first time in 2017. He appeared in all twelve of the Razorbacks' games, recording at least one tackle in each, and a season-high eight in the last game of the season against Missouri. On August 26, 2018, Morgan was placed on full scholarship alongside two other Arkansas players. In 2018 and 2019, Morgan again made appearances in every game for Arkansas, totaling 24 and 39 tackles, respectively, over the course of each season. Prior to the 2020 season, Morgan was voted one of four team captains by his teammates under new head coach Sam Pittman, and garnered nationwide recognition by the end of the season. He was named a second-team All-American by the Walter Camp Football Foundation and the American Football Coaches Association, and earned third-team All-America honors from college football analyst Phil Steele. Morgan was also named first-team all-SEC by the Associated Press and SEC head coaches, the first Razorback to be named by both since Martrell Spaight in 2014. On August 12, 2021, Arkansas announced that Morgan had signed a Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) deal with Walk-On's Bistreaux and Bar. As a senior, Morgan helped Arkansas to an 8-4 regular season, and a bid to the 2022 Outback Bowl against Penn State on New Year's Day. The Razorbacks went on to win the game, 24–10, finishing the 2021 season 9–4 and ranked in the Top 25.\nIn 2020, Morgan was named a finalist for the Burlsworth Trophy – which is given to the best national player who began their college career as a walk-on – alongside Dax Milne and eventual winner Jimmy Morrissey. Morgan was again named a finalist in 2021, alongside Carlton Martial and Stetson Bennett. The trophy ceremony was held at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art on December 6, and Morgan was announced as the winner.\nProfessional career.\nMorgan signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars as an undrafted free agent on May 2, 2022. He was waived on August 26 and re-signed to the practice squad. He was released off the practice squad on September 12.\nCoaching career.\nIn April 2023, Morgan joined the Illinois coaching staff as a graduate assistant.\nPersonal life.\nMorgan is the second of seven siblings. He has an older brother – former Arkansas wide receiver Drew Morgan – in addition to four younger sisters and a younger brother. Morgan graduated from the University of Arkansas in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in kinesiology, and again in 2020 with a Master of Science in operations management. On January 4, 2020, Morgan married his longtime girlfriend, Sydnie, an Arkansas Tech softball player."

The series also saw a resumption of the long-running cricketing rivalry between the two north-west African nations.\nSierra Leone stunned the hosts by winning the first match with a single scored off the last ball of their twenty overs. Nigeria levelled the series after another close finish in the second game, winning by just six runs. The third game was a more one-sided affair, with the hosts claiming a 69-run victory to lead the series 2–1 at the halfway stage. The fourth game resulted in another comfortable win for the hosts, this time by nine wickets. Nigeria sealed the series after winning the fifth game, during which Peter Aho took six wickets for just five runs, the best bowling figures in a T20I."

        "text": "Robert Weiner is an American football coach. He currently serves as the co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Toledo.\nEarly life and education.\nWeiner is from Tampa, Florida, and attended Jesuit High School. He then attended Boston College, earning a bachelor's degree in English and secondary education. Weiner never played football; instead, he played on his high school's tennis team.\nCoaching career.\nHigh school.\nShortly after his graduation from Boston College, Weiner returned to his alma mater, Jesuit High School, to accept a position as an assistant coach for the football, basketball, and baseball teams. He held these positions from 1989 to 2003, when he departed Jesuit for Crystal River High School in Crystal River, Florida. He spent two seasons there before accepting the position of head football coach at Henry B. Plant High School in South Tampa. He served in this position from 2004 to 2019, with remarkable success. In the two seasons before Weiner arrived, Plant suffered through a combined 1–19 record, and the team had not recorded a winning season in the last decade. During Weiner's sixteen seasons as Plant's head coach, the team only recorded two losing seasons – his first and his last. The team went 3–7 under Weiner in his first year, but proceeded to win 14 consecutive district championships, a streak that ended after Plant went 4–6 in 2019, Weiner's last season. During Weiner's time at the helm, Plant won four FSHAA state championships (in 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2011), finished as state runners-up twice, and won a total of 172 games. While coaching at Plant High School, Weiner also taught AP English Literature and Composition. He has stated in interviews that \"Ulysses\" is among his favorite works that he studied in college.\nWeiner coached several notable athletes during his time at Plant, including future Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray, future Miami and Purdue quarterback Robert Marve, and future South Florida and Arizona quarterback Jordan McCloud.\nOn January 22, 2013, Weiner announced that he had accepted a position as the wide receivers coach at South Florida, however, he reversed this decision within 48 hours and ended up remaining at Plant. Ultimately, Weiner accepted a position as the co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Toledo on January 2, 2020. Weiner had long been linked to potential collegiate jobs; he stated that he had been offered a college coaching job in each of his final seven years at Plant, including one from Toledo that he declined.\nSuspension.\nOn October 2, 2019, Weiner received a six-week suspension for violations of the Florida High School Athletic Association rules regarding athletic recruiting and improper contact with a player that were self-reported by Plant High School. Specifically, Weiner violated the FHSAA's rules against coaches making living arrangements for players, since he made arrangements for a player (who was only practicing with the team and did not play in games) to live with a Plant High School parent after his elderly caretaker was no longer able to look after him. In addition to the six-week suspension, Weiner was also fined $5,000. Following the announcement of the suspension, Weiner defended his actions, saying, \"I can also stand here and honestly say, without any question, that we did not violate the educational, athletic spirit and philosophy.\" Following an appeal, his suspension was reduced to three weeks.\nCollege.\nWeiner's first season at Toledo was in 2020. He was rated No. 2 in the Mid-American Conference for class of 2022 recruiting by 247Sports. In 2022, Weiner coached Maxwell Award finalist, Dequan Finn to Toledo's first MAC West Championship since 2017.\nPersonal life.\nWeiner and his longtime girlfriend, Tonya Thomas, maintain houses in Toledo, Ohio, and Tampa, Florida."

After finishing second in the opening time trial, behind Yves Lampaert of , Wout van Aert of Jumbo–Visma took the yellow jersey in stage 2 by virtue of bonus seconds. Danish rider Magnus Cort of EF Education–EasyPost took all King of the Mountains (KoM) points available in Denmark, collecting enough for him to wear the polka dot jersey until stage 9. During this run he claimed the record of most consecutive summits won, from former Tour champion and multi-time mountains classification winner Federico Bahamontes. Sprinter Dylan Groenewegen of won the final stage in Denmark, before a transfer day and return to France.\nOn stage 4, van Aert extended his lead with a solo attack into Calais. Stage 5 involved cobbles for the first time since 2018, with Pogačar gaining time in the general classification over every contender including Vingegaard, who had mechanical issues, and Roglič who crashed and dislocated his shoulder. Stage 6 was the longest of the race, with van Aert taking part in the breakaway to extend his lead in the points classification, before eventually being caught and falling off the back losing the overall lead. In the final uphill sprint, Pogačar out sprinted everyone to win the stage and take the \"maillot jaune\" by virtue of the bonus seconds.\nStage 7 was the first summit finish of the race at Super Planche des Belles Filles. A group of contenders made their way up the majority of the climb together, before Vingegaard attacked and only Pogačar could follow. In a sprint on the final slope, Pogačar overtook Vingegaard to get the stage win and extend his lead to over 30 seconds. Other contenders lost between 20 seconds and over a minute to the leading two. After stage 8, a hilly stage that finished in Lausanne, Switzerland where van Aert extended his points classification lead further, and stage 9 in the Swiss Alps where Bob Jungels won the day and Simon Geschke gained enough points to take the polka dot jersey, the first rest day took place in Morzine. \nWeek Two.\nDuring the second week, stages 10 and 18 were disrupted by Climate Change protesters, which forced stages to be halted for a short period. Media discussed the legitimacy of the protest and the effect that climate change was having on the Tour, while other coverage expressed annoyance at the disruption to the race. The second week of the race was affected by an intense heat wave, with several stages having temperatures of around . Some riders suffered heat stroke including Alexis Vuillermoz on stage 9.\nNo major attacks by contenders occurred on stage 10, the first in the French Alps, however Lennard Kämna who was in the breakaway that finished close to ten minutes ahead of the peloton, came within eleven seconds of taking the yellow jersey from Pogačar. The stage was won by Magnus Cort, in a photo finish ahead of Nick Schultz. Stage 11 was a summit finish at the Col du Granon – which was included in the Tour for the first time since 1986. After constant attacks by Roglič and Vingegaard on the flat before the Col du Galibier, a gap opened up between Pogačar and Vingegaard on the final ascent to Col du Granon. Vingegaard gained nearly three minutes on Pogačar, winning the stage and taking the yellow jersey. At the end of the day only six riders were within five minutes of Vingegaard in the overall situation: Bardet, Pogačar, Thomas, Quintana, Yates and Gaudu.\nStage 12 to Alpe d'Huez was the \"queen stage\" of the Tour, taking place on Bastille Day. Neilson Powless of Team attacked at kilometre zero and stayed at the front of the race until near the very end. Tom Pidcock of Ineos Grenadiers and former Tour winner Chris Froome, attacked about halfway through the stage and bridged up to the leading breakaway riders. On the final ascent of Alpe d'Huez, Pidcock attacked from the group including Powless, Froome, Ciccone and Meintjes and rode on to a convincing solo victory. In the race, Pogačar attacked Vingegaard twice, with both riders dropping the other contenders on the climb, however the Slovenian rider was unable to shake off the Dane.\nThe transitional stage 13 out of the Alps was won by the sprinter Mads Pedersen of , and stage 14 was won by Michael Matthews of from the breakaway, who was just able to drop Alberto Bettiol prior to reaching the summit of the final intermediate climb. Behind Matthews, Pogačar and Vingegaard attacked the peloton on this same climb and extended their lead over the other contenders. Stage 15, before the second rest day, took the Tour to Carcassonne where the final breakaway rider in Benjamin Thomas was caught in the final few hundred meters to set up a sprint finish, which was won by Jasper Philipsen. Jumbo–Visma lost two riders on stage 15: team leader Roglič abandoned the race following his injuries on stage 5, and domestique Steven Kruijswijk left the race in an ambulance after dislocating his shoulder in a crash. \nWeek Three.\nAfter a rest day in Carcassonne, the race entered the Pyrenees. Stage 16 was won by Hugo Houle of Israel–Premier Tech, after a solo attack from the breakaway with around to go. Rafał Majka, a \"key lieutenant\" of Pogačar did not start stage 17, due to an injury suffered after he threw his chain near the end of stage 16. Brandon McNulty of UAE Team Emirates pulled his teammate Pogačar and Vingegaard up to the final steep slopes of Peyragudes, increasing the gap to the rest of the peloton. Inside the final 500m of steep climbing Pogačar attacked, but Vingegaard responded and followed with a counter attack of his own. Just before the line, Pogačar was able to come around him to win his third stage of the Tour and reduce Vingegaard's lead in the by four seconds thanks to bonus seconds, to 2 minutes 18 seconds.\nOn stage 18 – the final day in the Pyrenees – Pogačar attacked Vingegaard multiple times on the Col de Spandelles, with Vingegaard able to keep up every time. On the descent, both riders pushed hard: Vingegaard almost crashed, while Pogačar did crash after slipping on gravel. Pogačar was able to continue with minor cuts to his leg; in a moment of sportsmanship, Vingegaard slowed down and waited for Pogačar.\nBefore the ascent of the Hautacam, both riders were caught by a larger group including Thomas and two of Vingegaard's teammates (Sepp Kuss and Tiesj Benoot). On the final climb, a furious pace was set by Kuss, leaving all other contenders behind. Meeting up with van Aert ahead (who had been in a breakaway), the high tempo continued, until van Aert and Vingegaard attacked Pogačar with around to go to the top. Pogačar was unable to keep up, so Vingegaard extended his lead to almost three and a half minutes. By taking maximum points at the top of Hautacam, Vingegaard gained an unassailable lead of that classification, taking the jersey from Simon Geschke of Team , who had set a record for most days by a German rider leading the mountains classification.\nAfter the transitional stage 19 was won by Christophe Laporte of Jumbo-Visma, the final time trial to Rocamadour was won by van Aert, followed by Vingegaard, Pogačar and Thomas. The traditional final stage on the Champs-Élysées in Paris completed the Tour, with sprinter Jasper Philipsen winning his second stage of the Tour.\nIn the general classification, Vingegaard became the first Dane to win the Tour since 1996, with Pogačar in second 2 minutes 43 seconds behind. Thomas was third, over seven minutes behind. The points classification was won by Wout van Aert with 480 points, breaking Peter Sagan's modern record. Vingegaard also won the mountains classification, marking the first time since the Faema team of Eddy Merckx in 1969, that riders from the same team won the yellow and green jerseys as well as the mountains classification. The young rider classification was won by runner-up Pogačar, who led the classification from start to finish and tied Jan Ullrich and Andy Schleck with his third win of this classification. The team of third place Thomas, Ineos Grenadiers, won the team classification. Van Aert was chosen as the most combative rider. Caleb Ewan was the Lanterne rouge - normally competitive with the elite sprinters, his top 10 result on stage 21 was his highest stage finish of the Tour.\nThe race had the fewest finishers since 2000, with just 135 of the 176 starters reaching the finish line in Paris. The teams of the first two podium finishers were severely depleted by the end of the race, with Team UAE Emirates losing half its start list due to injury and illness, and Team Jumbo-Visma losing several key members along the route. Several riders were forced to leave the race due to contracting Covid, including stage winners Magnus Cort and Simon Clarke, and former Tour winner Chris Froome of .\nIn August 2022, Colombian rider Nairo Quintana of Arkéa–Samsic was disqualified from 6th place overall, after blood samples tested positive for tramadol, a painkiller.\nNotes.\nAs of 1 March 2022, the UCI announced that cyclists from Russia and Belarus would no longer compete under the name or flag of those respective countries due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine."

The route generally headed eastwards from Paris, including gravel sections in Champagne vineyards, stages in the Vosges mountains (including the longest, stage 5), and a summit finish at La Super Planche des Belles Filles. The route was welcomed by the professional peloton, with riders praising the variety of stages. Campaigners such as Kathryn Bertine also welcomed the route. The overall length of the event was met with agreement, with some teams noting that they do not \"yet have the staff or numbers ... for a three-week event.\"\nThe route itself required a waiver from the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), as Women's WorldTour races have a maximum stage length of and a maximum race length of six days. The restrictions were criticised by the professional peloton and campaigners as \"sexist\", as the UCI does not allow women to compete over identical distances as men. \n&lt;section begin=stages /&gt;\n&lt;section end=stages /&gt;\nRace overview.\nAnnemiek van Vleuten, Elisa Longo Borghini, Ashleigh Moolman, Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig, Marta Cavalli and Katarzyna Niewiadoma were all named as pre-race favourites for the general classification (GC), with Lorena Wiebes and Elisa Balsamo tipped for the points classification.

He played college football for the Syracuse Orange and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Buccaneers after the 2023 NFL draft.\nEarly years.\nTucker was born on October 25, 2001, in Owings Mills, Maryland. He attended Calvert Hall in Towson, Maryland, where he played football and also ran track. Considered one of the top running back prospects in Maryland by ESPN (#14), 247Sports (#27, rated three-star) and Rivals (#27), Tucker was recruited by Syracuse assistant coach Reno Ferri.\nCollege career.\n2020.\nAs a freshman in 2020, Tucker was named Syracuse's starting running back four games into the season following a rash of injuries and opt-outs due to COVID-19 pandemic. He ran for the third-most yards (626 yards) and the second-most yards per game (69.9) in a single season by an Syracuse Orange freshman ever. He was named the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) \"Running Back of the Week\" twice and led all freshmen running backs in the ACC in rushing yards per game.\n2021.\nDuring the breakout 2021 season, Tucker totaled 1,496 rushing yards during the 2021 regular season, fourth best among all Division I FBS players. He became the first player in program history to rush for over 1,000 yards in eight games or less and set the program record for most 100-yard games in a season (8) and most consecutive 100 yards games at 7. He broke Joe Morris's 42-year record for Syracuse's most single-season rushing yards in game against NC State. In addition to breaking this record set in 1979, Tucker also overtook Syracuse greats such as Floyd Little, Walter Reyes, and Larry Csonka. In the game against Albany, Tucker had a combined 253 yards (132 rushing, 121 receiving) and five touchdowns, becoming the first player in program history to have both 100+ rushing yards and 100+ receiving yards. Tucker surpassed 1,000-yard mark in win over Virginia Tech. Against Boston College, he amassed a career-high 207 rushing yards.\nTucker was named to the Associated Press midseason All-America first team. ESPN college football analyst Trevor Matich named Tucker one of four candidates for the Heisman Trophy. He was the semifinalists for the Doak Walker Award as well as the Maxwell Award. Tucker was named the ACC Running Back of the Week multiple times.\nTucker was named to first-team All-ACC, first-team All-American by Football Writers Association of America, ESPN and second-team All-American by the Associated Press, Walter Camp Football Foundation, and American Football Coaches Association.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in 2023 NFL draft, Tucker signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent on April 29, 2023. On August 29, 2023, the Buccaneers announced that he had made the initial 53-man roster. In Week 1 of the 2023 season Tucker saw action against the Minnesota Vikings having 5 carries for 15 yards and 2 receptions for 9 yards."

        "title": "Owen White (baseball)",
        "text": "William Timothy Owen White (born August 9, 1999) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2023.\nAmateur career.\nWhite attended Jesse C. Carson High School in China Grove, North Carolina. White was a three–sport athlete in high school, playing basketball through his senior year and quarterback on the football team through his junior season. White finished his senior season after posting a 10–1 record, 0.22 ERA, with 101 strikeouts in innings. He was named the North Carolina Gatorade baseball Player of the Year for 2017–2018. White committed to the University of South Carolina to play college baseball for the South Carolina Gamecocks.\nThe Texas Rangers selected White in the 2nd round, with the 55th overall selection, of the 2018 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with Texas for a $1.5 million signing bonus.\nProfessional career.\nAfter signing, White did not appear in an official game with a Rangers' affiliate in the 2018 season. Instead, he took part in a new program put in place by Texas for their newly drafted high school pitchers. The \"de-load\" program as the organization called it, emphasized building a foundation mentally and physically while resting the pitchers' bodies from a strenuous senior season and pre-draft showcase circuit. The players were put through a strength program and classroom work until the post-season fall instructional training started. White suffered a torn UCL and underwent Tommy John surgery in May 2019, causing him to miss the entire season. White did not play in 2020 due to the cancellation of the Minor League Baseball season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhite spent the 2021 season with the Down East Wood Ducks of the Low-A East. In his first professional game, White struck the ground with his right hand after making a fielding error and fractured his hand. After making a rehab appearance with the ACL Rangers of the Rookie-level Arizona Complex League, he returned in August and finished the season posting a combined 4–1 record with a 3.06 ERA and 56 strikeouts over innings. Following the 2021 season, White played for the Surprise Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League. White was named to the Fall League All-Star team. White was named the AFL Pitcher of Year, after posting a 5–0 record with a 1.91 ERA and 29 strikeouts over innings.\nWhite opened the 2022 season with the Hickory Crawdads of the High-A South Atlantic League. After going 6–2 with a 3.99 ERA and 81 strikeouts over innings for Hickory, White was promoted to the Frisco RoughRiders of the Double-A Texas League in June. With Frisco he posted a 3–0 record with a 2.49 ERA and 23 strikeouts over innings. White missed over two months with a right forearm strain, but returned in time to pitch in the Texas League playoffs. White was ranked as the 59th overall prospect in baseball by Baseball America, the 66th overall prospect by MLB Pipeline, and the 70th overall prospect by The Athletic's Keith Law during the 2023 off-season. On November 15, 2022, the Rangers selected White to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.\nWhite suffered neck inflammation in spring training and was optioned back to Frisco to begin the 2023 season. In 11 starts for Frisco, he registered a 2–3 record and 3.54 ERA with 45 strikeouts in innings pitched. On June 13, 2023, White was promoted to the major leagues for the first time. He made his major league debut that night versus the Los Angeles Angels in relief, allowing three runs over two innings and suffering the loss. He was optioned back to Frisco following his debut. After a final appearance for Frisco, he was promoted to the Round Rock Express of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League on June 20. White was selected to represent Texas in the 2023 All-Star Futures Game.\nWhite was optioned to Triple–A Round Rock to begin the 2024 season. White was called up on April 19, 2024."

        "text": "Michael Anthony Hughes II (born February 1, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) and the Basketball Champions League (BCL). He played college basketball for the Akron Zips and the Duquesne Dukes.\nEarly life and high school career.\nHughes joined his first basketball league at the age of five. He attended Liberty High School in Liberty, Missouri during his freshman year. Due to redistricting, Hughes transferred to Liberty North High School for his sophomore season. As a sophomore, he averaged 12.1 points and 8.7 rebounds per game. Hughes averaged 14.4 points, 12 rebounds, and 4.7 blocks per game as a junior, while shooting 59.7 percent. He earned Suburban Middle Seven All-Conference first-team honors as well as all-district accolades after helping guide Liberty North to a fifth-consecutive district championship. As a senior, Hughes averaged 22 points and 15 rebounds per game. He set school records for rebounds (979) and blocks (349) during his career. He committed to playing college basketball for Akron.\nCollege career.\nHughes averaged 1.8 points and 1.2 rebounds per game as a freshman at Akron. Following the season, he transferred to Duquesne, following coach Keith Dambrot who was hired there. Hughes underwent surgery in the summer for stress fractures in his shins. During his redshirt season, he focused on dieting and conditioning, eventually losing 45 pounds. As a sophomore, Hughes averaged 11.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks per game, which was second in the Atlantic 10 Conference. On December 4, 2019, he scored a career-high 23 points to go with 11 rebounds in a 71–58 win against VMI. During his junior season, Hughes was a strong defensive presence but struggled with foul trouble. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.8 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 2.7 blocks per game. As a senior, Hughes averaged 10.8 points and 7.9 rebounds per game. He finished as the program’s all-time leader in career field goal percentage, making 56.2 percent of his shot attempts, as well as fourth on Duquesne’s all-time blocks list with 177.\nProfessional career.\nOn August 15, 2021, Hughes signed his first professional contract with BC Vienna of the Austrian Basketball Superliga.\nOn July 14, 2023, Hughes signed a one-year deal with CBet Jonava of the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL).\nPersonal life.\nHughes is the fourth of six children born to Robbie-Joe and Michael Hughes I. His father died in 2003, while competing in a men's basketball league at Longview Community College. According to an autopsy, he had an enlarged heart. Following his father's death, Hughes became close with his older brother Tony. In February 2006, his mother discovered Tony dead in his room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 19. The loss of his older brother turned Michael into a selfish and angry player on the court, until his coaches found a way to curb his negative behavior. Hughes developed a love for reading."

It was held on outdoor hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City.\nDaniil Medvedev and Emma Raducanu were the men's and women's singles defending tournament champions. Raducanu lost to Alizé Cornet in the first round, while Medvedev lost to Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round.\nCarlos Alcaraz and Iga Świątek won the men's and women's singles titles, respectively. Carlos became the first male player from the 2000s (born in 2003) and Iga became the second female player from the 2000s (born in 2001), to win the tournament's singles titles.\nTournament.\nThe 2022 US Open was the 142nd consecutive edition of the tournament and took place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park of Queens in New York City, New York, United States.

        "text": "The men's extreme slalom at the 2021 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships took place on 24 and 26 September 2021 at the Čunovo Water Sports Centre in Bratislava. It was the 4th edition of the event, after it made its debut in 2017 in Pau. 82 athletes from 34 nations competed.\nThe event was won by Joe Clarke of Great Britain, 2016 Olympic Champion in K1, securing his fourth medal at World Championship level and first individual gold. Finn Butcher of New Zealand won silver, his first medal at this level, while Austrian World No. 1 Mario Leitner won bronze.\nBackground.\nStefan Hengst of Germany entered the event as the reigning world champion, a title he won in 2019 in Prague. Austria's Mario Leitner entered as the World No. 1, having finished third in the 2021 World Cup standings. The winner of the standings was Czech Vít Přindiš, who also entered as a favourite.\nParticipation in the event was the largest in history, leading into the events Olympic debut in 2024. \nCompetition format.\nThe men's extreme slalom event in canoe slalom is split into two phases - time trials and knockout-style heats. On the Friday, all athletes complete a timed run of the course alone and are seeded based on their performance, with those awarded faults ranked last. 32 athletes progress to the heats, with the advancing paddlers selected first by National Federation, and then time. That is, if there are 32 or more competing federations, only the fastest athlete from each of the 32 fastest federations will advance. If there are less than 32 federations competing, the second fastest athletes from each federation will advance and so on until 32 positions are filled. A federation can enter a maximum of four boats in the time trials.\nOn Sunday, the advancing athletes are split into 8 heats of 4, arranged in an order specified by the rulebook (page 74). The heats and subsequent rounds involve head-to-head racing of 4 boats on the course, where paddlers must navigate 2 upstream gates, a series of downstream gates and perform a complete eskimo roll. The athletes select their positions in the start ramp, with preference given in the order which they were seeded by the time trials. The highest two ranked athletes in each heat progress to the quarter-finals, then to the semifinal and final. Whichever athlete is ranked first in the final is awarded gold. Athletes can be penalised in three ways in each round, by receiving a fault (FLT), being a ranked last finisher (RLF), or by not finishing (DNF). Faults are incurred for false starts, missing gates or failing to correctly perform a 360-degree roll. Athletes are ranked last (RLF) if they breach the safety requirements of the competition, such as by holding back another athlete with their hands or paddle, deliberately paddling over another athlete's boat, or by making dangerous contact with another athlete's head or body - all other non-dangerous contact is allowed. In each round athletes are ranked first by the order in which they cross the finish line, with those incurring penalties ranked in the following order: FLT, RLF, DNF, .\nThe final classification of athletes is determined in the following manner: Athletes eliminated at any phase of the competition will be given their rank based on the comparison of the time trial times of athletes eliminated at the same phase. All 3rd ranked athletes will be ranked above all 4th ranked athletes. The final rank of athletes who did not progress to the heats is determined by their time trial results.\nResults.\nTime Trials.\nWorld Cup overall winner Vít Přindiš of the Czech Republic was fastest in the time trials with a time of 54.99 ahead of Italian Giovanni De Gennaro. With 32 National Federations making the start, all were permitted 1 starter only in the heats. The fastest non-qualifiers were Benjamin Renia of France (7th) and Joe Clarke of Great Britain (10th). However, the qualifying athletes from Australia and South Africa scratched from the heats, allowing both to progress - Vavřinec Hradilek of the Czech Republic in 11th was then the fastest non-qualifier. Hradilek and Clarke set identical times of 55.92, with Clarke favoured due to his higher world ranking. Hengst and De Dionigi also failed to progress, guaranteeing a first-time World Champion in this event. The top ten in the time trials were as follows:\nKnockout rounds.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTop Half\nBottom Half\nFinal.\nAs the highest-seeded athlete, Mario Leitner chose the rightmost starting position. Clarke started in the leftmost position, Pasiut centre-left and Butcher centre-right. Clarke was fastest to the first set of upstreams and opted for the left one, while all other three went to the right. Butcher started slowest but successfully undercut Pasiut and Leitner in the first upstream. Clarke and Butcher opted for separate upstreams in the second set, with no change of lead. Butcher gained steadily in the final gates but could not overtake Clarke. \nJoe Clarke won gold to 'resurrect' a disappointing weekend in his favoured K1 event, which saw him eliminated in the heats. Finn Butcher's silver was his first at Championship level, after he also won silver in the opening World Cup of 2021. Leitner's bronze was also his first world championship medal, while Pasiut achieved a career-best 4th. All competitors completed penalty-free runs."

Originally, the tour was scheduled to take place in May 2021, but it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All of the matches took place at the VRA Cricket Ground in Amstelveen, and was the first bilateral series between the two sides.\nThe matches were played between the second and third Test matches that England played against New Zealand. Netherlands captain Pieter Seelaar commented on his frustration of several players being unavailable for the national team due to their commitments in the T20 Blast.\nIn the first ODI, England were put into bat and went on to score the highest innings total in an ODI match, with 498/4 from their 50 overs. England also broke the highest total in a List A cricket match, surpassing the 496/4 that Surrey made in the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy. England then bowled the Netherlands out for 266 to win the match by 232 runs. Pieter Seelaar was ruled out of the second ODI due to a back injury, and he later announced his retirement from international cricket, with Scott Edwards captaining the team for the last two matches. England won the second ODI by six wickets, after the match was reduced to 41 overs per side due to a wet outfield, to win the series with a match to play. Prior to the third and final ODI, England's captain Eoin Morgan was ruled out of the match with a groin injury, with Jos Buttler named as the team's captain in his place. England won the third and final match by eight wickets to win the series 3–0. Six days after the end of the series, Eoin Morgan announced his retirement from international cricket.\nSquads.\nPaul van Meekeren and Fred Klaassen were added to the Dutch squad for the third ODI."

        "title": "Will Rogers (American football)",
        "text": "William Wyatt Rogers III (born August 19, 2001) is an American football quarterback who plays for the Washington Huskies. He holds Mississippi State program records in nearly every major passing category and Southeastern Conference (SEC) records for single season and career completions.\nEarly life and high school career.\nRogers was born on August 19, 2001, in Louisville, Mississippi. He spent his early years in Louisville before his family moved to Brandon, Mississippi, when he was in the seventh grade. The second of three children, his mother Judy attended the University of Alabama while his father Wyatt, a football coach, attended the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss). His paternal grandfather Bill Rogers also attended Ole Miss, playing on the school's baseball team with Archie Manning. Rogers grew up an avid fan of the Ole Miss Rebels football team, idolizing quarterbacks Eli Manning and Bo Wallace. A strong athlete, he played a variety of sports growing up, including baseball and soccer. However, he was the most passionate about football, where in elementary school he ran drills with his father's high school players. While in middle school, Rogers would be mentored by future National Football League (NFL) quarterback Gardner Minshew, whom his father coached in high school, with the two forming a bond that continued even after Minshew had left Brandon to play college football.\nRogers attended Brandon High School, where he played football under his father who served as the team's offensive coordinator. He became the team's starting quarterback as a sophomore, throwing for 2,476 yards and 18 touchdowns. In his second season as a starter, Rogers threw for 3,009 yards and 23 touchdowns, 14 of which were caught by future 2nd round draft pick Jonathan Mingo, and helped Brandon reach the state semifinals. As a senior, Rogers threw for 3,572 yards and 38 touchdowns and was named a member of the Mississippi AllStar Team.\nRecruiting.\nRogers was a 3 star prospect coming out of high school, ranked by 247Sports as the 29th best prostyle quarterback of his class. There was little mutual interest between Rogers and his childhood team of Ole Miss, as the Rebels had hired Rich Rodriguez as their offensive coordinator, whose read option offense typically utilizes a dualthreat quarterback rather than a prostyle quarterback. Rogers instead committed to play college football at Mississippi State University over an offer from Washington State, citing his relationship with Mississippi State head coach Joe Moorhead and the team's playing style as the reasons for his commitment.\nCollege career.\n2020.\nSoon after Rogers enrolled at Mississippi State, the Bulldogs fired head coach Joe Moorhead in favor of Mike Leach, who had unsuccessfully recruited Rogers while at Washington State. In the offseason, Rogers and K.J Costello battled to become the team's starting quarterback, with Leach ultimately deciding to start Costello for the season's first game. \nRogers made his collegiate appearance against Kentucky, replacing a struggling Costello. Rogers was unimpressive in his debut, throwing two interceptions. The following week, Rogers was once again put in to relieve a struggling Costello, and threw for his first career touchdown in 2814 loss to Texas A&amp;M. Against the eventual national champion Alabama, Rogers replaced Costello for the third week in a row midgame, this time due to Costello suffering a concussion. Rogers had a mediocre statistical performance against Alabama, but was praised by coach Mike Leach. \nRogers made his first career start the following week, throwing for 224 yards and a touchdown in a 2417 win over Vanderbilt. Rogers served as the Bulldogs starter for the remainder of the season, recording a 33 record. His best performance of the season came in the teams Egg Bowl rivalry game against Ole Miss, throwing for a then careerhigh 440 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 3124 loss.\n2021.\nRogers entered the Bulldogs 2022 campaign as the team's starting quarterback, beating out transfer Chance Lovertich for the position. In the season opener against Louisiana Tech, the Bulldogs fell behind 3114 in the 4th quarter before Rogers led the team to three straight touchdown drives to win the game 3534, in what was then the largest comeback in program history. Two weeks later, he threw for a seasonhigh 419 yards on a schoolrecord 50 completions in a 3129 loss to Memphis. On October 2, he recorded his second 400 yard game of the season in a 2622 upset victory over Texas A&amp;M. For his performance against Texas A&amp;M; he was named the SEC offensive player of the week. The following week against top five ranked Alabama, Rogers suffered an AC joint sprain but remained in the game, throwing for 300 yards, but would post his only sub100 passer rating of the year in a 499 loss. On October 30, he completed 36/39 passes in a 3117 victory over Kentucky, setting an SEC record for single game completion percentage. The following week, he once again threw for 400 yards as well as four touchdowns in a 3128 loss to Arkansas. On November 13, Rogers would have a historic performance on the road against Auburn. After falling behind 283, Rogers threw for six touchdowns, setting a school record for singlegame passing touchdowns and leading the Bulldog's to their largest comeback in school history, ultimately winning 4334. In the Bulldog's final game of the regular season against Ole Miss, Rogers threw for 336 yards but the team fell to their instate rival for the second year in a row. Rogers finished the season having thrown an SEC record 505 completions and set program records with 4,738 passing yards and 36 touchdowns.\n2022.\nRogers got off to a strong start in 2022, throwing for 450 yards and five touchdowns in the Bulldogs opening game victory over Memphis. Three weeks later he threw for 409 yards and 6 touchdowns in a blowout win against Bowling Green. On October 8, Rogers had his third 400yard performance of the season, and broke the Southeastern Conference career completions record. In doing so he eclipsed the 921 completion mark set by Aaron Murray, despite playing in 24 fewer games than Murray. Following losses to Alabama and Kentucky, Rogers bounced back by throwing for three touchdowns in a 3933 win over Auburn. Two weeks later, he posted a 194.0 passer rating, his highest of the season, in a blowout win over East Tennessee State. In the Bulldog's final game of the season against Ole Miss, Rogers earned his first victory against his childhood team in a 2422 victory. Two weeks prior to the Bulldogs bowl game, coach Mike Leach died after suffering a heart attack. Rogers would lead the Bulldogs to an emotional victory in their bowl, dedicating the win to Leach in a postgame interview. He finished the season with 3,713 passing yards and 34 touchdowns. \n2023.\nEntering the 2023 season Rogers holds Mississippi State records in career passing yards, completions and touchdowns. Rogers entered the transfer portal on November 24, 2023. On December 15, he announced that he would be transferring to Washington. On January 12, 2024, he announced he was decommiting due to Kalen DeBoer becoming the head coach at Alabama, but he later chose to remain at Washington after Jedd Fisch was hired as the head coach."

        "text": "The 2022–23 European Rugby Champions Cup was the ninth season of the European Rugby Champions Cup, the annual club rugby union competition run by European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) for teams from the top five nations in European rugby and South Africa. It was the 28th season of pan-European professional club rugby competition.\nDutch beer brand Heineken continued as the title sponsor of the competition, extending their deal after their previous agreement expired at the end of the 2021–22 season.\nThis was the first year to feature the top teams from South Africa, following the inaugural United Rugby Championship season.\nThe tournament commenced in December 2022. The final was held at Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland on 20 May 2023. The match was a repeat of the 2022 final, with Stade Rochelais defeating Leinster for the second consecutive year.\nTeams.\nTwenty-four clubs from the three major European domestic and regional leagues competed in the Champions Cup.\nThe distribution of teams was:\nThe following teams qualified for the tournament.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeedings and structure.\nFor the purposes of the pool draw, the 24 clubs were separated into tiers based on their league finishing position, and clubs from the same league in the same tier were not drawn into the same pool. The number 1 and number 2 ranked clubs from each league are in Tier 1, the number 3 and number 4 ranked clubs are in Tier 2, the number 5 and 6 ranked clubs are in Tier 3, and the number 7 and number 8 ranked clubs are in Tier 4.\nIn effect, each pool contains one team from each of the three leagues, from each of the four tiers.\nPool play will feature the Tier 1 teams playing the Tier 4 teams in their pool twice, home and away, while the Tier 2 and 3 clubs will follow in a similar manner. However a team will not play the relevant team from its own league i.e. the tier 1 French team will play the tier 4 English and tier 4 URC team in its pool, but will not play the tier 4 French team in its pool. Each team will therefore play four pool games over four match weekends.\nAs with the previous two seasons, the 24 teams will play four rounds of pool matches. These will take place from 9–18 December 2022 and 13–22 January 2023. Sixteen teams will qualify for the knockout rounds. In a change from the 2021–22 format, the round of 16 contests will take the form of a single match rather than a two-legged tie.\nThe eight teams from each pool with the best points will qualify for the knockout stage, a single-leg single-elimination bracket of 16 teams. Teams finishing 9th and 10th after pool play will join the Challenge Cup, also at the round of 16 stage (joining twelve qualifiers from the Challenge Cup pool stage), once more in a single-leg single-elimination bracket. Last season's home-and-away two-legged round of 16 has not been continued.\nPool stage.\nTeams were awarded four points for a win, two for a draw, one bonus point for scoring four tries in a game, and one bonus point for losing by less than eight points.\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage began with the round of 16, starting on 31 March 2023, and concludes with the final on 20 May 2023.\nUnlike the previous year, the round of 16 consists of a single leg of matches, consisting of the top eight ranked teams from Pool A and Pool B respectively, with the top four from each receiving home advantage.\nWhilst the round of 16 follows a pre-determined format, the quarter-finals include an expected home advantage to the higher ranked team. The semi-finals are to be played at a neutral venue.\nSemi-finals.\nBoth semi-finals will be played in Europe and the highest-ranked clubs from the pool stage has country advantage. If a South African team had been ranked higher, the game would still have been located in Europe.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags to the left of player names indicate national team as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules, or primary nationality for players who have not yet earned international senior caps. Players may hold one or more non-WR nationalities.\nMost points.\nSource:\nMost tries.\nSource:"

        "title": "Survivor Series (2021)",
        "text": "The 2021 Survivor Series was the 35th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on November 21, 2021, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, and was the first Survivor Series to livestream on Peacock. The theme of the event was brand supremacy and featured wrestlers from the two brands against each other; this was the final Survivor Series to carry the brand supremacy theme as well as the traditional Survivor Series matches.\nSeven matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show. The card was highlighted by two traditional Survivor Series elimination matches: Raw's men's and women's teams were victorious over SmackDown's. In the main event match, SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns defeated Raw's WWE Champion Big E. In other prominent matches, Raw Tag Team Champions RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) defeated SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), and in the opening bout, Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch defeated SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair. The event also commemorated the 25th anniversary of The Rock's WWE debut at the 1996 Survivor Series where a 25-man dual-branded battle royal took place in honor of the occasion; Raw's Omos won by last eliminating SmackDown's Ricochet. Raw won brand supremacy by winning five of the seven matches, only excluding the pre-show and main event matches. The event also had a promotional tie-in with the Netflix film \"Red Notice\", which stars The Rock, though The Rock himself did not appear at the event despite rumors before the show suggesting that he would have appeared.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual professional wrestling event produced every November by WWE since 1987. The second longest running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble, originally referred to as the \"Big Four\", and as of August 2021, it is considered one of the \"Big Five\", along with Money in the Bank. The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically features teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. Announced on August 16, 2021, the 2021 event was the 35th Survivor Series and was scheduled to be held on November 21, 2021, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. In addition to airing on traditional pay-per-view worldwide and the WWE Network in international markets, it was the first Survivor Series to livestream on Peacock after the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March. Tickets went on sale on September 24 through SeatGeek.\nSince WWE reintroduced the brand split in July 2016, Survivor Series has also centered around competition between wrestlers from Raw and SmackDown for brand supremacy. In addition to traditional Survivor Series matches between the brands, the champions of Raw face their SmackDown counterparts in non-title matches, which began at the 2017 event. The 2021 Survivor Series featured Raw's WWE Champion against SmackDown's Universal Champion, the Raw Women's Champion against the SmackDown Women's Champion, Raw's United States Champion against SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion, and the Raw Tag Team Champions against the SmackDown Tag Team Champions. The 2019 event had also featured the NXT brand - being elevated to third main brand status with its debut on USA - involved in the competition, making all brand supremacy matches triple threats. NXT was removed from the 2020 event due to COVID-19-related issues, and in September 2021 was repositioned to its previous status as the developmental brand for the main roster under the \"NXT 2.0\" banner.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised seven matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nOn November 6, WWE revealed both Raw and SmackDown's team members for the men's Survivor Series match. Team Raw's members were announced to be Seth Rollins, Finn Bálor, Kevin Owens, Rey Mysterio, and Dominik Mysterio. On the November 8 episode of \"Raw\", WWE official Adam Pearce noted that every member of Team Raw was a former world champion, except Dominik. In turn, Pearce scheduled Dominik to face Bobby Lashley where the winner would be on the team; Lashley defeated Dominik. After Rey was seemingly injured during a match with Lashley the following week, Pearce removed Rey from Team Raw and replaced him with Austin Theory. For Team SmackDown, its members were announced as Drew McIntyre, Jeff Hardy, King Woods, Sami Zayn, and Happy Corbin. On the November 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", Hardy defeated Zayn in a match where the loser would be removed from the team. The vacant spot was filled the following week by Sheamus, who defeated Cesaro, Jinder Mahal, and Ricochet in a fatal four-way match to earn the spot.\nAlso on November 6, WWE revealed both Raw and SmackDown's team members for the women's Survivor Series match. It was announced that Bianca Belair, Liv Morgan, Carmella, Queen Zelina, and one-half of the WWE Women's Tag Team Champions, Rhea Ripley, would represent Team Raw. Team SmackDown's members were revealed to be Sasha Banks, Shayna Baszler, Shotzi, Natalya, and Aliyah. On the November 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", however, WWE official Sonya Deville removed Aliyah from the match seemingly due to her relationship with Naomi, who had been at odds with Deville. On November 18, Deville revealed via WWE's social media that Toni Storm would fill Team SmackDown's vacant spot.\nA prominent rivalry heading into Survivor Series was between WWE Champion Big E and Universal Champion Roman Reigns. On the September 17 episode of \"SmackDown\", Big E interrupted a promo by Reigns, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), and Paul Heyman of The Bloodline. Reigns and Big E then posed with their belts, leading to a tag team match where Big E was victorious. Later that night, he told Heyman and Reigns that he would face the Universal Champion at Survivor Series before The Usos attacked him. This led to a six-man tag team match pitting The New Day (Kofi Kingston, Big E, and Xavier Woods) against Reigns and The Usos on the September 20 episode of \"Raw\", which The Bloodline won after interference from Bobby Lashley. This led to a triple threat match where Reigns defeated Big E and Lashley, who Reigns pinned. With The New Day resuming their feud with The Usos in late October, on November 8, it was announced that Big E would face Reigns one-on-one at Survivor Series.\nAlso on November 8, it was announced that Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch and SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair, who have had a long history with each other, would face each other at Survivor Series. \nFor the remaining champion vs. champion matches, on November 15, WWE announced Raw Tag Team Champions RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) vs. SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) and Raw's United States Champion Damian Priest vs. SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura, the latter of which was scheduled for the Kickoff pre-show on the day of the event.\nTo commemorate the 25th anniversary of The Rock's WWE debut at the 1996 Survivor Series, a 25-man dual-branded battle royal was scheduled to take place at the 2021 event.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nOn the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show, SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura (accompanied by Rick Boogs) faced Raw's United States Champion Damian Priest. Priest controlled the match early while Boogs played his guitar to try and distract Priest. Priest performed a Falcon Arrow for a near-fall. Nakamura countered a Chokeslam with his knee. Priest performed a South of Heaven for a nearfall. Priest attempted The Reckoning, but Nakamura countered with an armbar. In the end, Priest broke Boogs' guitar over his knee and hit Boogs over the head before accidentally hitting Nakamura with it and getting himself disqualified, thus Nakamura won, giving SmackDown the first match of the night.\nAlso during the pre-show, WWE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mr. McMahon arrived at the arena holding what he said was a real Cleopatra golden egg, which was part of a promotional tie-in with the Netflix film \"Red Notice\", which stars The Rock.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch taking on SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair. The two started the match by slapping and hair pulling. Flair attempted the Top Rope Moonsault, but Lynch shoved her off the top rope to the floor. Lynch applied the Dis-Arm-Her, but Flair countered with a Powerbomb. Lynch performed a leg drop to the back of Flair's neck while she was caught up in the ropes. Lynch attempted her own version of Flair's figure-four leglock, but Flair reversed the pressure until Lynch made it to the ropes. Flair performed a Queen's Boot for a nearfall. Lynch performed an Inverted DDT and a Manhandle Slam, but Flair put her foot on the bottom rope to void the pin. Flair performed a Top Rope Moonsault on Lynch outside the ring. Back inside, Flair did a roll-up pin, but the referee caught her holding onto the ropes for leverage. Lynch then reversed the pin and used the ropes herself as leverage to win the match, giving Raw its first match of the night.\nNext was the men's Survivor Series elimination match where Team Raw (Seth Rollins, Finn Bálor, Kevin Owens, Bobby Lashley, and Austin Theory) took on Team SmackDown (Drew McIntyre, Jeff Hardy, King Woods, Sheamus, and Happy Corbin). At the start, Owens walked out on his team and got eliminated by countout. Corbin was eliminated by Bálor following a Coup de Grâce. Woods was eliminated by Lashley as he passed out in the Hurt Lock. Lashley and McIntyre fought outside the ring and both were eliminated by countout. Bálor was eliminated by Sheamus after a Brogue Kick. Sheamus was eliminated by Theory with a roll-up. Sheamus attacked Hardy before leaving, but Hardy eliminated Theory after a Swanton Bomb. Hardy performed a Twist of Fate on Rollins, but Rollins got the knees up to block the Swanton Bomb and performed The Stomp on Hardy to win the match as the sole survivor for Team Raw, thus putting the score at 2-1 for Raw.\nIn a backstage segment, Roman Reigns met with Mr. McMahon in the latter's office. There, McMahon showed Reigns the golden egg that he said was given to him by Reigns' cousin, The Rock, and that it was worth $100 million as it was the real egg and not a prop used in \"Red Notice\".\nAfter that was the 25-man dual-branded battle royal to celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Rock's WWE debut. Raw's Omos dominated the match by eliminating half of the competitors. His tag team partner AJ Styles stayed outside the ring for most of the match, but was eliminated despite help from Omos. Omos won the match after last eliminating SmackDown's Ricochet, thus giving Raw a 3-1 lead over SmackDown.\nThe fourth match saw Raw Tag Team Champions RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) taking on SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso). This was Orton's 177th match on pay-per-view, breaking a tie with Kane for most pay-per-view matches contested. In the end, Jey performed a Superkick on Riddle. Both Usos performed Double Superkicks on both Orton and Riddle. Jimmy went for the Uso Splash on Riddle, not knowing that Orton was the legal competitor. Orton caught Jimmy in mid-air with an RKO to win the match, thus putting the score at 4–1 for Raw, clinching brand supremacy for the night.\nIn another backstage segment, Mr. McMahon, Adam Pearce, and Sonya Deville were talking in McMahon's office when they realized that the golden egg had disappeared. McMahon ordered Deville to call the police and then told Pearce to tell everyone on both the Raw and SmackDown rosters to report to \"Raw\" the next night as he was going to get to the bottom of it.\nThe penultimate match was the women's Survivor Series elimination match where Team Raw (Bianca Belair, Rhea Ripley, Liv Morgan, Carmella, and Queen Zelina) took on Team SmackDown (Sasha Banks, Shayna Baszler, Shotzi, Natalya, and Toni Storm). Carmella was eliminated by Storm after a roll-up while Carmella was trying to put her protective mask on. Storm then eliminated Zelina by performing the Storm One. Morgan eliminated Storm after performing an Oblivion on Storm. Morgan was eliminated by Banks after both Banks and Shotzi performed back-to-back Frog Splashes on Morgan. Baszler eliminated Ripley by pinfall after a Knee Strike, leaving Belair at a 4-1 disadvantage. Banks and Shotzi began to argue as Baszler tried to calm things down, but Banks shoved Shotzi into Baszler. Shotzi, Baszler, and Natalya all kept Banks from returning to the ring, resulting in Banks being eliminated by countout. Natalya locked Belair in the Sharpshooter, but Belair kicked Natalya into Baszler and Belair eliminated Natalya with a roll-up. Belair eliminated Baszler after a Glam Slam and then pinned Shotzi after the Kiss of Death to win the match for Team Raw as the sole survivor, and giving Raw an overall 5-1 lead on the night.\nAnother backstage segment occurred where interviewer Kayla Braxton informed Roman Reigns' special counsel Paul Heyman that Brock Lesnar's suspension was no longer indefinite.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Raw's WWE Champion Big E faced SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman). Big E attempted the Apron Splash, but Reigns moved out of the way. Big E applied a Stretch Muffler, but Reigns escaped. Reigns performed a Rock Bottom on Big E for a nearfall. Reigns performed a Superman Punch twice, but missed a Spear attempt and Big E performed a Spear through the ropes to put Reigns on the floor. Big E attempted a second one, but Reigns countered with the Guillotine submission. Big E countered the submission and performed a Big Ending on Reigns, who got his foot on the bottom rope during the pin. Reigns performed a Spear for a nearfall. On the outside, Big E threw Reigns into the announce table and the barricade, but Reigns reversed another attack and threw Big E into the steel steps. Reigns performed a Superman Punch, and back in the ring, Reigns attacked Big E's injured knee and performed a second Spear on Big E to win the match. Although this gave SmackDown another win, it was only SmackDown's second win for the night, with the final score being Raw 5, SmackDown 2.\nReception.\nThe event received mostly negative reviews from critics and fans alike, specifically towards the Survivor Series elimination matches, which received average reviews, but the battle royal being the most disliked match. Criticism was also directed at promoting the event as the 25th anniversary of The Rock's WWE debut but without a live appearance or even a pre-recorded message by The Rock himself. The Rock only appeared in archive footage that highlighted his career.\nThe event was voted by readers of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" as the Worst Major Wrestling Show of 2021.\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Mr. McMahon addressed the entire Raw and SmackDown roster over the stolen Cleopatra Egg, stating that whoever found it would be rewarded with a WWE Championship match. He also threatened to fire Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville if the egg was not found. Sami Zayn revealed to McMahon that it was Austin Theory who stole the egg, and Theory explained that he had just wanted to take a selfie with it. McMahon was first mad at Theory, but then told Theory he showed intestinal fortitude, rewarding him a WWE Championship match against Big E in the main event, much to Zayn's confusion and displeasure. Theory, however, lost the title match. This began a storyline between McMahon and Theory, with Theory becoming McMahon's protégé until McMahon announced his first retirement in July 2022.\nAlso on \"Raw\", Seth Rollins talked about being the sole survivor for his team at Survivor Series when Finn Bálor interrupted. The two were scheduled to have a match that night, but it never began when Rollins laid out Bálor with two Stomps. Their match was rescheduled for the following week, where Rollins won.\nAfter the aforementioned title match, Big E attacked Kevin Owens and Seth Rollins, who showed up during the match. The following week, Rollins (who announced that his match against Big E for the WWE Championship would take place at Day 1) attacked Owens during the latter's match against Big E. As a result, Owens was added to the title match, making it a triple threat match. However, two weeks later, it became a fatal four-way match when Bobby Lashley, who recently completed his feud with Rey and Dominik Mysterio, defeated Owens, Rollins, and Big E in a gauntlet match.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown\", a Black Friday Invitational Battle Royal took place, where the winner would face Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship at a future date. In the end, Jeff Hardy thought he won by last eliminating Happy Corbin, but Sami Zayn, who wasn't officially eliminated, eliminated Hardy to win the match. Immediately afterwards, it was announced that Brock Lesnar's suspension was lifted and he would return the following week. There, he convinced Zayn into cashing in his title shot that night. It was then announced that the winner would defend the title against Lesnar at Day 1. Just before the match, Lesnar attacked Zayn, allowing Reigns to quickly defeat Zayn and retain the title, officially scheduling Reigns to defend the championship against Lesnar at Day 1.\nAfter Shayna Baszler, Shotzi, and Natalya caused Sasha Banks to be eliminated by countout during the women's Survivor Series match, Banks teamed with Naomi, who would continue her feud with Sonya Deville over the next few weeks, to defeat Natalya and Baszler on the following episode of \"SmackDown\".\nFuture.\nThe 2021 Survivor Series would be the final Survivor Series to carry the brand supremacy theme, as on September 19, 2022, WWE executive Triple H announced that the would not be based on this concept. He also announced that the 2022 event would feature two WarGames matches, one each for the men and women, marking the first time for a main roster WWE event to feature the match; this in turn discontinued NXT's annual WarGames event, which was held from 2017 until 2021. The 2022 Survivor Series was subsequently rebranded as \"Survivor Series: WarGames\". The retained the WarGames theme."

        "text": "The Women's K1 at the 2021 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships took place on 23 and 25 September 2021 at the Čunovo Water Sports Centre in Bratislava. It was the 41st edition of the event, and 58 athletes from 29 nations competed.\nBackground.\nEva Terčelj of Slovenia entered as the reigning world champion, having taken the title in 2019 in La Seu d'Urgell. Jess Fox was the World No. 1 and came into the championship having won the 2021 World Cup overall title and the last three World Cups. Ricarda Funk was the Olympic Champion from Tokyo and had the opportunity to become the first athlete to win the Olympics and World Championships in the same calendar year. World number 3 Corinna Kuhnle was also a favourite, as the winner of the 2019 World Cup round on this course and having become European Champion earlier this year.\n3-time Olympic medallist Maialen Chourraut and World No. 5 Stefanie Horn were notable absentees from the field. Leading into the event, Jana Dukátová announced her retirement, ending a 25-year career that saw her become a three-time World Champion: 2006 in K1; 2010 in C1; and 2011 in K1 team.\nCompetition format.\nThe women's K1 event in canoe slalom uses a three-round format with heats, a semifinal and final. Athletes complete up to two runs in the heats. In the first heat, the 20 fastest women qualify automatically for the semifinal, whilst the rest complete another run in the repêchage second heat for a further 10 qualification positions. The final rank of non-qualifying athletes is determined by their second run score. Athletes start in the reverse order of their heats position in the semifinal and complete a single run, with the top 10 advancing to the final. The athlete with the best time in the single-run final is awarded gold.\nPenalties of 2 or 50 seconds are incurred for infractions such as missing a gate, touching a gate, or not negotiating gates in numerical order. A team may request up to one review of a penalty per boat in the heats or semifinals phases, with no enquiries considered in the finals.\nResults.\nTokyo Olympic bronze-medallist Jessica Fox topped the first heat with a clean 89.18 ahead of Olympic Champion Ricarda Funk. Camille Prigent won the second heat with the fourth-fastest time of the day. 2016 Olympic silver-medallist Luuka Jones finished 14th in the second heat, missing out on a spot in the semifinal.\nDespite 4 seconds of penalties, Funk topped the semifinal ahead of Corinna Kuhnle and Fiona Pennie. Fox initially set the fastest time but was awarded a 50-second penalty on downstream gate 12, placing 25th. Reigning Champion Eva Terčelj also received a 50-second penalty, finishing 26th. This left Kuhnle as the only previous World Champion (2010 and 2011) in the final.\nFunk won the 2021 K1W World Championship in a time of 94.80, including a 2-second penalty. Fellow countrywoman Elena Apel won silver, forming the first quinella in this event since Angelika Bahmann and Petra Krol finished 1–2 in 1977. Great Britain's Kimberley Woods won bronze, 3 days after winning the teams title and just a week after being involved in a car accident whilst preparing for the event. Funk's victory marked the first time any canoe slalom athlete became Olympic and World Champion in the same calendar year.\nPenalties are included in the time shown. The fastest time in each round is shown in bold."

        "text": "The teams events at the 2021 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships took place on 22 September 2021 at the Čunovo Water Sports Centre in Bratislava. It was the 41st edition of the K1M, K1W and C1M team events, and the 8th edition of the C1W team event.\nCompetition format.\nTeams events in canoe slalom use a single-round format with the team with the fastest time inclusive of penalties awarded gold. Teams started in reverse order of their results at the previous World Championships in 2019. Teams consist of three athletes from the same nation, who must complete the course at the same time, often employing a technique known as 'weaving' in upstream gates, where one paddler exits the gate at the same time as the other enters in order to minimise time loss.\nPenalties are compounded for each gate, such that a team can incur a total of 150 seconds of penalties on a single gate (if all three miss it) or 6 seconds (if all three touch it). The time begins when the first paddler crosses the start beam and ends when the last one crosses the finish beam. All three paddlers must cross the finish line within 15 seconds or else incur an additional 50 second penalty.\nWomen's K1 Teams.\nGreat Britain entered the event as favourites, being the reigning World and European Champions. They won the event with a clean run of 101.24 seconds over 2019 silver-medallists the Czech Republic and host nation Slovakia. The British win was particularly significant, given Kimberley Woods had been in a wheelchair less than a week prior, following a car accident. This was Jana Dukátová's last teams event after she announced her retirement at the end of 2021, having taken the teams title in 2011.\nMen's K1 Teams.\nSpain entered the event as the reigning World Champions, whilst the Czech republic fielded a team including 2020 Olympic Champion Jiří Prskavec and 2021 overall World Cup Champion Vít Přindiš. The event was won by France in a clean run of 91.64 ahead of host nation Slovakia and Slovenia. The Czech Republic finished fourth after Prskavec had to paddle back for gate 10 following a near collision whilst weaving. Germany completed the course in the fastest raw time (90.99) but was awarded a 50 second penalty after they missed the last upstream gate in the windy conditions. 20 nations in total competed.\nWomen's C1 Teams.\nReigning World Champions Australia did not compete, fielding a depleted team at the championships due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. This meant that Spain held the number 1 bib after their silver medal in 2019. The Czech Republic team of 2021 overall World Cup Champion Tereza Fišerová and sisters Gabriela and Martina Satková won with a total time of 110.43, their seventh consecutive top three finish in this event. Spain came second by 1.57 seconds, and the team representing the Russian Canoe Federation placed third.\nMen's C1 Teams.\nHost nation Slovakia entered the event as the distinct favourites, having won the C1 team title a record 9 consecutive times from 2009 to 2019 - the longest winning streak in any canoe slalom event. The french team of 2021 overall World Cup Champion Denis Gargaud Chanut, 2020 Olympian Martin Thomas and two-time U23 World Champion Nicolas Gestin won in a time of 95.34, just beating out the Czech Republic. The reigning champions had to settle for the bronze after an early mistake."

        "text": "The 2022 Monaco Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2022) was a Formula One motor race held on 29 May 2022 at the Circuit de Monaco in the Principality of Monaco. It was round 7 of 22 in the 2022 Formula One World Championship.\nCharles Leclerc took pole in front of Carlos Sainz Jr. and Sergio Pérez. The race started with a rolling start after a 65-minute delay. Leclerc lost the race lead to strategy error and dropped down to fourth place behind Max Verstappen and Sainz, as Pérez won the race.\nBackground.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nMax Verstappen was the Drivers' Championship leader after the sixth round, the Spanish Grand Prix, with 110 points, 6 ahead of Charles Leclerc in second, with Sergio Pérez in third, 25 points behind Verstappen. In the Constructors' Championship, Red Bull Racing led Ferrari by 26 points and Mercedes by 75.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race.\nTyre choices.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C3, C4, and C5 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively) for teams to use at the event.\nPractice.\nThree free practice sessions were held per the sport's regulations. In defiance of Monaco tradition, for the first time the first two sessions were not held on Thursday but on Friday, in balance with the other Grand Prix weekends during the season. The first two practice sessions took place at 14:00 and 17:00 local time (), respectively, on 27 May. Charles Leclerc led both sessions, ahead of Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz Jr. in the first session, and ahead of Sainz and Pérez in the second session. Both sessions also had one red flag each; in the first session, it was after Mick Schumacher stopped by the pit lane with a gearbox issue, while Daniel Ricciardo had a crash in the second session. The final session took place on 28 May, 13:00 local time, ahead of the qualifying practice session. Pèrez was the fastest ahead of Leclerc and Sainz.\nQualifying.\nQualifying took place at 16:00 local time () on 28 May.\nQualifying report.\nIn the first segment of qualifying, there was a red flag after Yuki Tsunoda clipped the barrier, and Alexander Albon, Pierre Gasly, Lance Stroll, Nicholas Latifi, and Zhou Guanyu were eliminated from the session; some drivers, such as Valtteri Bottas, Gasly, Lewis Hamilton, and Zhou, were not able to have a final lap due to traffic and crossed the line on the checkered flag. In the second segment, Tsunoda, Bottas, Kevin Magnussen, Daniel Ricciardo, and Schumacher were eliminated.\nIn the third and final segment Sergio Pérez spun and crashed before the tunnel section, and was then hit by Carlos Sainz Jr., who saw the yellow flags too late. The red flag was thrown, and the session ended was not resumed, with the 30-seconds left on the clock not sufficient for anyone to start another lap. Charles Leclerc, who led all three qualifying sessions, took the pole position ahead of Sainz and Pérez. Championship leader Max Verstappen finished fourth, with Lando Norris, George Russell, Fernando Alonso, who crashed on his own at Mirabeau in his last flying lap, Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel, and Esteban Ocon completing the top ten.\nRace.\nThe race was due to start at 15:00 local time on 29 May and was scheduled to last for 78 laps. The race start was first delayed to 15:09, as heavy rain was identified approaching the circuit. The delay was to give teams time to switch to wet tyres before the start. Two formation laps were run at 15:16, before the decision was made to suspend the start procedure due to the rain intensity, and all cars were directed to the pit lane. In the interval between 15:16 and 16:05, a power failure to the start signalling systems, including the starting gantry and signal light panels, caused further delay. This failure, even after repaired, cast doubt on the ability to perform a standing start at all, and rolling starts were used for the rest of the race session. The two formation laps reduced the scheduled distance of the race by one lap, to 77.\nRace report.\nThe race began as the safety car led the field out of the pit lane at 16:05, with all drivers on wet tyres and a rolling start planned. Nicholas Latifi went long at the hairpin and Lance Stroll hit the barriers at Massenet while still behind the safety car; both went to the pit lane to fix their cars. On the lap 3 rolling start, pole-sitter Charles Leclerc led the race ahead of Carlos Sainz Jr., Sergio Pérez, Max Verstappen, and Lando Norris. The rain had stopped, and Pierre Gasly opted for intermediate tyres on lap 4, which was followed by other drivers at the back of the grid; he overtook Zhou Guanyu and Daniel Ricciardo on laps 12 and 15, respectively. By lap 14, Leclerc had built a lead of 4.7 seconds over Sainz, who was ahead of Pérez by 2.6 seconds, and Verstappen a few seconds further behind.\nOn lap 17, Pérez pitted for intermediate tyres, followed by Verstappen and Leclerc on lap 19. This left Sainz in the lead, the only driver in the top four still on wet tyres. Further back in the field, Esteban Ocon and Lewis Hamilton collided without damage on lap 18, and Ocon was given a five-second time penalty for the contact; on lap 20, Hamilton attempted to pass Ocon but did not succeed. On lap 21, race leader Sainz was instructed to pit, to swap from wet tyres directly to slick tyres. Leclerc, his teammate behind him in third, was first told via team radio to pit, and then not after he had already committed to the pit lane; both Ferrari cars pitted, with Sainz and Leclerc switching to the hard tyre. Due to Leclerc pitting immediately after Sainz (causing a delay to his servicing) and the lapped cars of Alexander Albon and Latifi on their out lap, Leclerc fell back to fourth behind Verstappen, while Sainz re-joined the track in second, behind Pérez and ahead of Verstappen, with Red Bull's overcut succeeding.\nOn lap 26, Mick Schumacher lost control of his car through the swimming pool section, crashing into the barriers. Although the car lost the rear and split in half, Schumacher came out of the accident unscathed. This led to a virtual safety car, then a full safety car, before the race was suspended with a red flag, given the need to repair the barriers. In red flag conditions, teams are permitted to change tyres as they choose. Both Ferrari cars kept the hard tyres they had been running on, while the Red Bull cars switched to new medium tyres. The race resumed at 17:15 under the safety car with a second rolling start. At the restart, Pérez led Sainz, ahead of Verstappen, Leclerc, George Russell, Lando Norris, and Fernando Alonso, who was able to maintain track position despite having a slower pace of several seconds. On lap 51, Norris went to the pits for medium tyres, while Zhou tried to overtake Yuki Tsunoda at the exit of the tunnel but almost lost control of the car. In the final laps, Pérez suffered graining on the tyres but was able keep the lead and win the race, ahead of Sainz, Verstappen, Leclerc, and Russell completing the top five. Norris, Alonso, Hamilton, Valtteri Bottas, and Sebastian Vettel completed the top ten, with Ocon falling to 12th. Due to the numerous delays, the three-hour time limit for the race (including stoppages) was reached, and only 64 laps were completed.\nAfter the race, Leclerc described the race as \"a freaking disaster\", and Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto said they would investigate the strategical error. At the same time, Ferrari lodged a protest against Red Bull, alleging that both cars went over the line at the pit exit, asking for a five-second penalty, in reference to the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix, and a clarification of the rules. The stewards dismissed both protests after Ferrari conceded that the Red Bull cars tyres' did not go over the white line. The race director's notes had been wrongly copied and pasted from 2021, and the rule had been changed from 2021 from \"any part of the car\" to \"any tyre of the car\" may not cross the line; had the rules not changed, Verstappen would have broken the rule. The FIA underwent further criticism, including by Formula One owners and Hamilton, for delaying the start.\nRace classification.\nNotes"

        "text": "The women's extreme slalom at the 2021 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships took place on 24 and 26 September 2021 at the Čunovo Water Sports Centre in Bratislava. It was the 4th edition of the event, after it made its debut in 2017 in Pau. 55 athletes from 24 nations competed.\nThe event was won by Jessica Fox of Australia, her 8th individual title in a third unique event. German Elena Apel won silver securing a third medal of the Championships along with her C1 world title and K1 silver, whilst 17 year old Evy Leibfarth won bronze, making her the youngest ever medallist in this event and securing USA's first canoe slalom medal since Michal Smolen won bronze in men's K1 in 2015.\nBackground.\nReigning world champion Veronika Vojtová of the Czech Republic, who took the title in 2019 in Prague, did not compete after missing out on domestic selection. Brazil's Ana Sátila entered as the World No. 1, having won the title in 2018, whilst the 2021 World Cup overall winner and inaugural champion Caroline Trompeter also entered as a favourite.\nParticipation in the event was the largest in history, leading into the events Olympic debut in 2024. \nCompetition format.\nThe women's extreme slalom event in canoe slalom is split into two phases - time trials and knockout-style heats. On the Friday, all athletes complete a timed run of the course alone and are seeded based on their performance, with those awarded faults ranked last. 32 athletes progress to the heats, with the advancing paddlers selected first by National Federation, and then time. That is, if there are 32 or more competing federations, only the fastest athlete from each of the 32 fastest federations will advance. If there are less than 32 federations competing, the second fastest athletes from each federation will advance and so on until 32 positions are filled. A federation can enter a maximum of four boats in the time trials.\nOn Sunday, the advancing athletes are split into 8 heats of 4, arranged in an order specified by the rulebook (page 74). The heats and subsequent rounds involve head-to-head racing of 4 boats on the course, where paddlers must navigate 2 upstream gates, a series of downstream gates and perform a complete eskimo roll. The athletes select their positions in the start ramp, with preference given in the order which they were seeded by the time trials. The highest two ranked athletes in each heat progress to the quarter-finals, then to the semifinal and final. Whichever athlete is ranked first in the final is awarded gold. Athletes can be penalised in three ways in each round, by receiving a fault (FLT), being a ranked last finisher (RLF), or by not finishing (DNF). Faults are incurred for false starts, missing gates or failing to correctly perform a 360-degree roll. Athletes are ranked last (RLF) if they breach the safety requirements of the competition, such as by holding back another athlete with their hands or paddle, deliberately paddling over another athlete's boat, or by making dangerous contact with another athlete's head or body - all other non-dangerous contact is allowed. In each round athletes are ranked first by the order in which they cross the finish line, with those incurring penalties ranked in the following order: FLT, RLF, DNF, .\nThe final classification of athletes is determined in the following manner: Athletes eliminated at any phase of the competition will be given their rank based on the comparison of the time trial times of athletes eliminated at the same phase. All 3rd ranked athletes will be ranked above all 4th ranked athletes. The final rank of athletes who did not progress to the heats is determined by their time trial results.\nResults.\nTime Trials.\nRicarda Funk of Germany was fastest in the time trials with a time of 57.33 ahead of Australian Jess Fox. With 23 National Federations starting, 9 federations were permitted 2 starters in the heats, and none were permitted 3. 2021 World Cup overall winner Caroline Trompeter did not progress to the heats. The fastest non-qualifiers were Fiona Pennie of Great Britain (10th) and Lucia Simonidesová of Slovakia (19th). The top ten in the time trials were as follows:\nKnockout rounds.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTop Half\nBottom Half\nFinal.\nApel lead into the first set of upstreams but relinquished the lead to Fox when they opted for different gates. Both chose the upstream on the left side of the course in the second set, but Apel was unable to undercut Fox. Jessica Fox won gold to 'resurrect' a weekend that say her miss out on the K1 and C1 finals at the World Championships for the first time in her entire career. Despite a late challenge from Leibfarth, Elena Apel held on to win silver in what was her third medal in as many events. 17 year old Evy Leibfarth's bronze medal made her the youngest ever medallist in this event. Naemi Brändle of Switzerland finished 4th in a career-best result. All completed penalty free runs."

He played three seasons for Canterbury-Bankstown of the New South Wales Rugby League Premiership. A goal-kicking fullback, Main played for the struggling Canterbury side who were playing their first seasons of professional football.\nPlaying career.\nOn Anzac Day, 1935, Main made his debut with the new Canterbury club (who played their first game in club history) against North Sydney. North Sydney would win the game 20-5. 3 rounds later, Main scored his first career points, kicking 3 goals in Canterbury's 22-14 loss to Newtown. In Round 5, Main played in a record-breaking 91-6 loss to the St. George Dragons. The game still remains as the largest winning margin (85) in a NSWRL/NRL game.\nIn Round 8, he recorded a respectable 6 goals against the eventual wooden spooners for the 1935 season, University. He helped his club win their first game in history, winning 21-2 after holding onto a 5-2 lead at half-time. One round later, Main kicked 5 goals against Western Suburbs, but his side lost 25-19. Main was employed as the side's regular goal kicker for the remainder of the season. At the conclusion of 1935, Main scored 29 goals in 14 appearances, totaling 58 points. He was Canterbury's leader in goals scored and points scored.\nAfter Main's solid 1935 season, he struggled to consistently play games. He only made 3 appearances in 1936, scoring 8 goals.\nThe following year, he only played the two opening rounds of the season, before finishing his career. He played the final game of his career in a Round 2 loss to South Sydney, kicking 3 goals. Main concluded his career with 42 goals (84 points) in 19 appearances."

The roster was composed of players from domestic and ABA League clubs, excluding Crvena zvezda and Partizan. On 18 October, the Basketball Federation of Serbia canceled the b-team training camp due to health issues of head coach Pešić. The B-team roster included: Mihailo Petrović, Ilija Đoković, Marko Pecarski, Aleksa Radanov, Dalibor Ilić, Stefan Đorđević, Boriša Simanić, Mihailo Mušikić, Nikola Jović, Nikola Đurišić, Matija Belić, Vojin Medarević, Dušan Beslać, Marko Pavićević, Arijan Lakić, Zoran Paunović, and Đorđe Pažin.\nStaff.\nAfter he got appointed as an assistant coach for the Dallas Mavericks, head coach Igor Kokoškov parted ways with the Basketball Federation of Serbia as the Serbian team coach on 14 September 2021. On 28 September, the Federation hired Svetislav Pešić as the new head coach for the Serbia men's national team. On the next day, the Federation hired Dragan Tarlać as the new national team director. In November 2021, Oliver Kostić, Marko Marinović, and Nenad Trunić were named assistant coaches. In February 2022, head coach Pešić added assistant coach Vladimir Jovanović, scout Miloš Isakov Kovačević, and physiotherapist Đorđe Milošević to his staff.\nExhibition games.\nSerbia played one exhibition game in June 2022. The game was played behind closed doors without any game reports or statements given after the game.\nQualification.\nFirst round – Group A.\nAs one of the 24 national teams that qualified for EuroBasket 2022, Serbia automatically qualified for the First round. Serbia was seeded in the Seed 1. The draw for the First round was held on 31 August 2021 in Mies, Switzerland. Serbia was drawn into the Group A with the Latvia, Belgium, and Slovakia. These matches was played in three windows in November 2021, February 2022, and June/July 2022 with two games played by each team in every window.\nGroup A is one of eight qualifiers groups of four teams. The groups will be conducted in a round-robin system, with each team playing all other teams in the respective group in home and away games. If Serbia finishes as one of the top three teams in its group, they will advance to the Second round of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification and will play against top three finishers of Group B, which is composed of Belarus, Great Britain, Greece, and Turkey. In February 2022, following a 3–1 record in the first four matches, Serbia secured their place in the second round of the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 European qualifiers.\nLatvia home game.\nLatvian guard Rihards Lomažs scored 33 points including six of theirs 16 three-pointers, but it was still Serbia who were left celebrating at the end of a thrilling duel in the Aleksandar Nikolić Hall, Belgrade. In his debut at the Serbia's bench, Svetislav Pešić oversaw his side's 101–100 triumph sealing victory in the closing seconds to start their quest towards the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. Latvia looked to be heading to a big victory as triple after triple rained down on the court in Belgrade, but the hosts stayed alive and overturned a 93–88 deficit with three minutes to go. Serbia took the lead inside the final minute and had another chance after Latvia leveled with Serbian forward Marko Jagodić-Kuridža sinking the decisive free throw for the win. Serbian guard Miloš Teodosić came off the bench with a typically instrumental performance to contribute an efficient 21 points along with 9 assists and was backed up by a string of valuable displays, including that of Aleksa Avramović, who had 17 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds and 3 steals. The game was played at a frantic pace and both teams shot above 70-percent from inside the arc and in a game of small margins, Serbia out-rebounded their opponents 29–20 and had the edge on second chance points at 11–6. Latvia had the lead for over 25 minutes, but not when it counted as the final buzzer sounded. Plenty to build from for both sides and Serbia will be mightily relieved to get off to a winning start.\nIn after-game interviews, Serbian players dedicated their victory to Stevan Jelovac, a former Serbian national team player who suffered a brain hemorrhage during an AEK practice session ten days prior to the game.\nBelgium road game.\nForward Alen Smailagić was ruled out of the roster due to injury. He was replaced by center Filip Petrušev.\nIn the battle to finish the first window with a 2–0 record, it was Belgium who prevailed to overcome Serbia in a 73–69 victory for a perfect start to their 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup European Qualifiers campaign. Belgian guard Sam Van Rossom stepped up to drain the go-ahead triple inside the final minute and added a late free throw to ice the game as Belgium produced a final flourish to take early control of Group A as the leaders. Serbia were in the ascendancy early on and moved 36–22 ahead in the second quarter and were still ahead by double-digits late in the third. There was a brief delay before the start of the fourth and Belgium resumed reinvigorated with a 12–2 start to take the lead and they would come through an exciting finish. Belgian center Ismaël Bako starred for the Belgian Lions with 14 points, 11 rebounds, 5 assists and 2 steals in an action-packed display, while Van Rossom top scored with 20 points and was clutch in the closing minutes to help secure the victory. Serbia finished 57 percent from inside the arc, but their struggles from outside amplified in the final quarter as they missed all nine attempts from three-point range and were held to 3-of-15 overall in the fourth. Two from two for Belgium is the dream opening, while Serbia were on the wrong end of another close encounter to finish the November window at 11.\nSlovakia home game.\nSerbia dropped Slovakia to 0–3 with a 75–63 win behind Aleksa Avramović's 14 points. Forward Marko Jagodić-Kuridža scored 13, as did guard Jovan Novak.\nSlovakia road game.\nOnce again, Serbia did not have things all their own way as Slovakia pushed them even closer in Levice before they prevailed for a 71–63 success. Serbian guard Aleksa Avramović played a leading role with 24 points, 6 assists and 3 rebounds in 30 minutes with teenage forward Nikola Jović stepping up with a contribution of 13 points and 7 rebounds amongst the starting five. Center Dušan Ristić was the third - and final - Serbian player in double figures with 12 points on 6-of-9 shooting to go with 8 rebounds and the starting center gave deserving praise to the opposition.\nLatvia road game.\nLatvia produced an impressive defensive display with a 66–55 victory over Serbia to the delight of their home fans, in Riga. While points may not have been accumulated as easily as they did in the first meeting in November, there was still little to separate the teams in a tightly contested first half. Serbia had opened up a nine-point lead at 34–25 before momentum swung in favor of Latvia with a 26–4 spell across quarters with the visitors held to just 10 points in 15 second-half minutes. Forward Artūrs Kurucs sparked the pivotal run in the third quarter with back-to-back threes for Latvia and finished with a team-high 13 points along with 4 rebounds and 6 assists in an all-round display. Latvian centers Klavs Cavars and Anžejs Pasečņiks shared 19 points and 5 blocks between them as they set the tone in the paint in the defensive effort. Serbia were held to just 59 points – their lowest total in the World Cup Qualifiers – as they shot an uncharacteristic 21-of-60 from the field. An NBA forward Nemanja Bjelica was restricted to just a solitary point and guard Aleksa Avramović was unable to add to his first-half tally of 16 points. Just what Latvia needed. If Belgium advance, as expected, then Luca Banchi's side will enter the Second Round at 2–2. Meanwhile, early concern for Serbia as they now head back home with added pressure on their reverse fixture with Belgium.\nBelgium home game.\nThe game was held in the Čair Sports Center, Niš. The game, originally scheduled for 3 July 2022 at 21:00, was postponed due to a lighting issue with just three minutes played and Belgium leading 6–3, and rescheduled to 4 July 2022 at 19:00. The game was resumed with 7:54 to play in the first quarter and the score of 6–3 in favor of Belgium.\nSerbia and Belgium started their duel on Sunday, and saw it finish more than 24 hours later on Monday. Serbia held a 10-point lead with just four minutes left to play, but they learned a lesson about a typical Dario Gjergja-coached team, be it on national team level or on the club level. His teams are stubborn. If Gjergja is on the sideline, don't expect the white towel at any point. Guard Manu Lecomte came up big in the clutch minutes. At 71–61 from Serbia's point of view, the Belgian comeback started with a Hans Vanwijn layup. Forward Maxime De Zeeuw knocked down a triple on the next offense. Lecomte added another one two possessions later. Lecomte got an and-one to complete the 11–0 run which got Belgium the lead heading into the last 120 seconds of the game. Serbia did briefly retake the lead on Ognjen Jaramaz's free throws. But with the game on the line, Lecomte get the game-winning layup to set the final score at 74–73 about 26 hours after the tip-off.\nSecond round – Group I.\nIn February 2022, following a 3–1 record in the first four matches, Serbia secured their place in the second round of the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 European qualifiers. They play against top three finishers of Group B, Great Britain, Greece, and Turkey. In March 2022, the fourth contestant of Group B, Belarus was expelled from the competition following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As only three teams played in the Group B, after the disqualification of Belarus, the result of the qualified teams from Group A against the last-placed team will not be carried over. Following two losses in August 2022, Serbia advanced to the second round with a 1–3 record.\nGreece home game.\nSerbia got their bid to reach next year's FIBA Basketball World Cup back on track with an important 100–94 overtime triumph against Greece in front of a European Qualifiers record crowd of 19,150. In a battle of two recent back-to-back NBA Most Valuable Players, it was Serbian center Nikola Jokić who prevailed over Greek forward Giannis Antetokounmpo as bottom beat top to open up Group I in the Second Round. Serbia had the lead for 41–23 of an enthralling contest, while Greece were only ahead for just over a minute. The depth for the hosts told with 33 points off the bench as they needed important contributions following an injury to Serbian guard Vasilije Micić, who had started well. The Serbians had been ahead for the majority of the contest and moved up by 10 in the fourth before Greece rallied to make it a one-possession game. Serbia made some big shots, but Greek guard Tyler Dorsey tied the game with a corner triple to force overtime. It was Serbia who made the first move in the extra period and this time, they were able to close it out. Jokić paced Serbia with 29 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists in the win, but there was a telling contribution off the bench from guard Ognjen Jaramaz: 15 points on 6-of-8 shooting including a huge three down the stretch in regulation. It was enough to fend off Giannis' European Qualifiers record-breaking effort of 40 points along with 8 boards and 5 assists. The Jokic-Giannis battle was epic and attention quickly turns to Sunday's games with Serbia visiting Turkey with the chance to move into the top three.\nTurkey away game.\nSerbia produced a near flawless first half as they led by 19 points as Serbian forward Nikola Kalinić beat the buzzer from inside his own half. However, Turkey rallied through their star trio of Cedi Osman, Furkan Korkmaz, and Alperen Şengün as they eventually tied the game at 72–72. Kalinić responded with a huge triple before a later offensive putback from Serbian center Nikola Jokić put the finishing touches on the win. Jokić made it look easy at times and put together a clinic in the paint with 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting in just 11 minutes of action in the first half. It was a slightly different story after the break as Jokić mostly sat on the bench watching Serbia's huge lead evaporate, but came up with an important score late on to finish with 24 points and 10 rebounds. There were also telling contributions from Kalinić and guard Marko Gudurić. Turkey's starters combined for 65 of their 72 points but ran out of steam down the stretch after a huge effort in the second half. The hosts were down at 27 percent from three-point range and it was Serbia who made the big shots count in the final two minutes of the game. Serbia scored the final seven points of the game to fend off an epic fightback from Turkey and win 79–72 on the road. The Serbians managed to prevent another famous sporting comeback in Istanbul to complete a perfect window having seen a lead as large as 21 points wiped out in the second half. The August window was bordering on make-or-break for Serbia with huge games with Greece and Turkey – they've beaten them both and reignited their campaign to move back to .500. In contrast, back-to-back defeats for Turkey dent their hopes of making it to the World Cup with a 2-4 record with the reverse fixture taking place in the next window in November."

        "title": "Dick Smith (rugby league)",
        "text": "Dick Smith was a rugby league player who represented New Zealand in one test match in 1932 against England on the wing. In the process he became the 218th player to represent New Zealand. He also played rugby league for Auckland. He was a member of the North Shore Albions (also named Devonport United), and the Newton Rangers clubs. His brother was Jack Smith, the New Zealand rugby league representative of the late 1930s, they were both the nephews of the well known sportsman of the 1890s-1910s George Smith.\nEarly life.\nDick Smith was born Walton Victor Roy Smith but later became known as Dick with his initials often being recorded as \"R. Smith\" and \"R.W. Smith\" in team lists and match reports throughout his career. He was born on July 26, 1911, to Walton Smith and Clara Evelyn Smith (née Green). He had an older brother named Richard Frederick Smith born in 1909, and a younger brother Charles Ernest Smith born in 1918, though Charles was better known as Jack Smith. Jack also went on to play for New Zealand in 1938 and 1939. Their uncle (Walton's brother) was George Smith, the famous sportsman who represented New Zealand in rugby union, rugby league, as well as winning the New Zealand Cup as a jockey. The family lived on Auckland’s North Shore at Devonport.\nCricket.\nIn 1925 Dick was playing for the North Shore 4th grade cricket side. He was awarded the \"T. Eyres bat\" for the \"highest batting in the fourth grade\" at the clubs annual awards. He progressed through the grades playing for the 3rd grade side by 1928 and in 1929 he was promoted to the North Shore senior B side aged 18 and was then chosen for the Auckland Colts for a tour of the South Island. In his side was future first class cricketer Trevor Lyon, and New Zealand Test cricketer Giff Vivian. He only managed 1 run in a match with an Otago side on December 25. Smith scored 10 runs and took a catch in their match with Southland on December 29. On January 1 he scored 34 at Oamaru against a North Otago side. It was said that he “did not get into his stride for some time, but hit hard for his 34”. He also took a catch and a wicket as Auckland went on to win the match on the second day. On the 3rd against South Canterbury at Timaru, \"Smith came to the crease [with Auckland 98/6] and played brightly...the rest went easily with the exception of Smith, who was undefeated\" on 43 at the end of Auckland's innings of 151. Auckland was bowled out for 125 in their second innings with Smith again not out on 7. In their final tour match against Ashburton on January 7–8 he scored 22 in a draw. He had been promoted up the order to bat at 5, after spending most of the tour at 7 or 8. After returning from the tour on January 25 he made his senior club debut for North Shore against United Suburbs. It was reported that \"Bush and R. Smith brightened the outlook. The latter, a promoted colt, was eventually bowled when attempting to put Horspool out of the ground\". On March 29 he scored 100 in a game against Eden while batting at number 4. The Auckland Star said \"the cricket was brighter than has been seen for some time past at Devonport, and this fact was in great measure due to the innings of R. Smith, who carried his bat for 100 dead. This was his first century in big cricket, and, although his innings was not chance less, he deserves high praise for his sparkling display. At no time was his batting dull, and his crisp well-timed strokes sent the ball to the boundary on fifteen occasions. more at home to the slow stuff stuff than to the faster variety of bowling, Smith thrived on leg deliveries, although his off shots were at times brilliant. With coaching he should develop into a batsman of more than ordinary ability\". After a handful of low scores to start the following season he was dropped to the B team and seemingly played no further cricket for North Shore.\nRugby league playing career.\nDevonport United and Auckland debut.\nIn 1929 Dick Smith was playing for the Devonport United rugby league fourth grade side. Devonport had formerly been known as North Shore Albions, which was the name they would revert to later in the 1930s. His fourth grade side went undefeated for the season, winning all 16 matches and scoring 352 points and only conceding 23. Smith was the captain of the side and received the cup on behalf of the team at Devonport's prize giving.\nSmith began the 1931 season in the Devonport reserve grade side. His debut in the senior side was on July 11 against Richmond Rovers in a round 11 match at Carlaw Park. Devonport won the game 14-10 with Smith scoring a try. The New Zealand Herald said \"R. Smith, a reserve grade player, was given a trial at centre. His promise in this position was one of the features of the game. Smith is a tricky and clever player with a natural side-step which left tacklers frequently grabbing the air. He was inclined to go a little too far at times when in possession\". His try came when Allan Seagar \"made a brilliant opening and [he] followed him through and scored a fine try by the posts\". Smith contributed a lot of Devonport's points over the remainder of the season. He scored tries in matches with Ellerslie-Otahuhu, Newton Rangers, Ponsonby United, and Marist Old Boys, as well as kicking several goals. He finished the season with 57 points from just 9 games making him the 4th highest points scorer in Auckland for the 1931 season. In the Roope Rooster final against Ponsonby on September 19 it was said that Smith along with Seagar \"dazzled with their side-stepping and incisive tactical moves which invariably threw the defence awry\". Later in the match in which he also kicked 5 goals “Smith paralysed his opponents with two sparking tries”. The Herald writer said that \"it was a pity the selectors did not give Smith an opportunity of playing as five-eighths with Davidson and List for Auckland against Northland\". However Smith was ultimately named in the side at five eighths along with Dunn from Richmond. The match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup was played at Carlaw Park on September 26. The game finished 19-19. Smith missed the conversion for Auckland's first try, but a while latter picked up a loose ball and sent Pat Meehan in for a try. He missed another conversion but in another attack set Meehan free again for another try.\nSmith's next match was in the Stormont Shield final against Marist Old Boys which Devonport won 25–6 with Smith scoring 2 tries. Then Devonport had the opportunity to play Eastern Suburbs who were touring Auckland. On October 10 they played at Carlaw Park before an enormous crowd of 17,000. Smith scored a try and kicked 6 goals however Devonport still went down 41-27. A week later on October 17 Smith played in a combined Devonport-Marist side against Eastern Suburbs and won 14–13. Smith then played the tourists for the third time on October 21 as part of an Auckland Colts side. The colts lost 18–13 with Smith kicking a conversion and a penalty.\nThe 1932 season saw Smith again playing at five eighth for Devonport and in 13 games he scored 54 points through 6 tries and 18 goals. He was the 3rd highest scorer behind Frank Delgrosso and Alan Clarke. He kicked a conversion and penalty in their round 9 win over Marist 7 points to 5 which secured the Fox Memorial title with a round to spare.\nNew Zealand selection.\nIn mid July Smith was chosen in a trial match to assist with the selection of the New Zealand team to play the touring England side. The trial was a curtain-raiser to the Auckland match with South Auckland on July 16. Smith played for the Probables side which beat the Possibles 26 to 12 and he scored a try. He picked up the ball around halfway and \"cut in nicely to outpace Delgrosso and score a nice try\". The Auckland Star said \"the Shore colt, R.W. Smith played his best game this season, but is still inclined to selfishness\". A week later he played in a second New Zealand trial match which was curtain-raiser to the North Island v South Island game. Smith was on the Probables team again but this time they lost 37 to 16 though he did manage a try and 2 conversions for the losing side.\nFollowing the inter-island match and trial game the New Zealand team was named with Smith in the reserves for the first test by the selectors (Thomas McClymont, Archie Ferguson, and Jim Sanders). It was said that he “gained precedence over Prentice”. It was then reported that P. Hart from the West Coast had not been able to recover from a leg injury that he sustained in the Inter-island match and so Smith replaced him in the starting side at wing. Unfortunately for Smith he was playing in a position that he had spent very little time in. The test was played at Carlaw Park before a crowd of 25,000 and saw New Zealand comprehensively outplayed, losing 24-9. New Zealand won very little scrum ball and the backs were starved of possession. Smith and Len Scott on the other wing \"never saw the ball in orthodox attack. That was not their fault, but in individual effort neither ... was up to the standard that one expects in big league football\". With New Zealand trailing 6-4 Smith was involved in an attack with Bert Cooke and Lou Hutt but Cooke's kick ahead saw the ball roll into touch a foot from the try line with Hutt and Smith the only players on hand. Then in the second half with England leading 11-9 Smith tackled Alf Ellaby with England threatening. England's final try came after \"weak play by Laing and Smith gave England another try\". The defence of Smith who was playing out of his regular position was also questioned along with that of his Devonport teammates Len Scott and Albert Laing \"for neither our wingers nor the full-back were equal to the occasion. Scott, who was expected to make the \"come back\" he made against Parkin’s side in 1928, showed no initiative and Smith, well, he wilted. It was too grave a risk with both of these players, one of whom had made no pretense to being a wing three-quarter (Smith)...\". For the second test all three were dropped and replaced by Steve Watene, Bert Cooke (who was moving from five eighth), and Ben Davidson. New Zealand lost 25 to 14 in Christchurch.\nSmith played in a round 10 loss for Devonport against City Rovers in the first grade championship which Devonport had already secured and was then named in a North Island side to play England in Wellington. The line up was then changed to include 3 South Island players and so the side essentially became a ‘New Zealand XIII’. Smith was chosen in an outside five eighth position alongside Edwin Abbott, with Wilf Hassan at half back. The New Zealand selection was thrashed 59-8 at the Basin Reserve in Wellington before a crowd of 4,000. They were unfortunate to lose captain Lou Hutt to a compound fracture of his thumb early in the match and had to play the remainder of the game with 12 players. Despite the poor showing by the side Smith was at least named in the reserves for the third test to be played back in Auckland.\nSmith then finished his season playing in 2 losses for Devonport. The first was a Roope Rooster semi final loss for Devonport against Marist where he contributed 10 of his sides points in their 19-18 defeat. While the second was in a loss to the same opponent in the Stormont Shield final.\nDevonport and Auckland again.\nThe 1933 season was very injury disrupted for Smith. He only played in 9 of Devonport's 17 matches. The season began with the annual club meeting for Devonport at which Smith was presented with Mr. Kiely's gold medal for the most individual points scored in the senior side. Through 6 games of the season Smith had scored 4 tries and kicked 8 goals for a total of 28 points. He was then selected for the Auckland side to play Taranaki on June 10. The match was played at Carlaw Park before 10,000 spectators who saw Auckland win 32-20. Smith scored Auckland's first try which he also converted. He kicked a further 3 conversions for a personal haul of 11 points. The Auckland Star noted that the Taranaki inside backs stood too deep, with the result \"that when Auckland backs obtained possession they were able to get up speed before they met the defence, and enjoyed more room to work in than they should have been permitted. This suited a tricky player like Smith, who was able several times to cut in and find gaps\". A week later in a match for Devonport against Marist Smith went off with an injured ankle. His injury occurred in a tackle and he was moved to fullback as a result before eventually leaving the field. Earlier in the match he had kicked a \"great penalty goal ... from just inside half-way\". The injury was more serious than first thought and he did not play again for 3 months when he turned out for Devonport in the Stormont Shield final against Richmond Rovers. Devonport had qualified for the match by winning the Fox Memorial title for the second consecutive year. It was revealed that Smith had broken \"a small bone in his leg\" and it was thought at the time that he \"will not be available for the rest of the season\". With Smith out injured and the first grade title on the line the Devonport coach Allan Seagar came out of retirement to play. It was reported 6 weeks after the injury that he was moving about on crutches. Despite the suggestion that he would miss the rest of the season he was named to play in a challenge round match against Newton on August 26 however he ultimately didn't take the field. Then on 6 September the New Zealand Herald reported that \"R. Smith, the Devonport five eighths, who broke a bone in his leg during championship matches, has made a good recovery. He expects to play for his club against Richmond in the [Stormont Shield] champion of champions match on Saturday week\". He kicked a conversion and a penalty in a 12–7 win to help Devonport claim their 3rd Stormont Shield title. It was said that he played \"a fine game at five-eighths\". The match had unofficially been meant to find a club opponent to play against the touring St George team who had finished runner up in the 1933 NSW RFL however ultimately they also played the losing Richmond side twice anyway. Devonport lost the match 19 to 8 before 9,000 spectators at Carlaw Park with Smith playing at five eighth.\nIt was mentioned at the start of the 1934 season that he would again be playing for Devonport if fit however he ultimately did not play a single game all season. Smith did however make a return to the Devonport side in 1935. In their first match of the season against Marist he kicked 4 goals in a 17–17 draw. In their round 3 match he had to leave the field injured. Then in round 4 against Newton Rangers Smith was described as \"mediocre at fullback, and gave a colourless exposition. In the fading stages, however, he came into the play and was the means of forcing and scoring Shore's one and only try with credit\". He only played in 3 more matches for Devonport with his last coming on June 15 about the halfway mark of the season.\nTransfer to Newton Rangers.\nIn 1936 Smith began playing for Newton Rangers across the Waitematā Harbour. He was listed in their squad for their round 4 match against Devonport however he did not play in the game. His transfer was granted on May 27. In his first appearance against Richmond Rovers on May 30 he played on the wing but \"did not have many chances\". He finished the season having played 11 games and scored 3 tries though Newton finished last in the Fox Memorial championship.\nReturn to the North Shore.\nSmith did not play at all in the 1937 season, then in 1938 he returned to Devonport who had changed their name back to their original North Shore Albions which they had been prior to their merger with the Sunnyside club. The transfer of \"W.V.R. Smith (Newton Rangers) to North Shore Albions\" went through at the control board meeting of April 13. North Shore was being coached by Bob Banham, who had been brought to Auckland from Australia by the Auckland Rugby League to help develop the game. Dick was also playing with his younger brother Jack Smith for the first time. Following their first match with Marist on April 9 the Herald reported \"both the Smith brothers were associated in some nice play with the coach, and their play will be more effective once movements have been discussed with Banham\".\nIn the middle of the season on May 28 Dick and Jack's father 'Walter' died suddenly. Neither of the brothers played in the North Shore side the following weekend where the team wore white armbands (Devonport wore all black jerseys). The Auckland Rugby League gave their sympathies to the family and Dick wrote a letter on behalf of the family thanking them. The brothers returned to play in June 4 and Dick ended the season having played 10 games, scoring 18 points. He spent the later part of the season playing at full back. His season finished prematurely after he was injured in a July 9 game against Richmond. It was said he was playing \"well at fullback, particularly in the first half, when he made some fine saves\". They had six players leave the field injured at various stages and played the second half with 11 men.\nSmith had seemingly retired and did not play at all in 1939 or 1940. He did however come out of retirement in 1941. During the war years a large number of players had gone to fight overseas and many retired players, or players later in their careers turned out for sides to ensure they could continue. The Auckland Star reported that Jack Smith, who was away at an army training camp, had his place \"taken at full-back by his brother, R. Smith, and there he gave good service\". In \"his first appearance at Carlaw Park for three years\" he kicked 3 conversions and a penalty in a 23–3 win over Marist. He \"played a sound game, both in defence and attack, and kicked with judgment considering the heavy state of the ground\". Against Richmond a week later he \"was a tower of strength at fullback\". North Shore went on to win the championship for the 6th time in their history. Dick's final two appearances for North Shore were on October 11 in a 21-12 Phelan Shield semi final loss against Mount Albert United where he kicked 3 penalty goals. And then on October 18 in their 30-10 Stormont Shield final loss to Manukau where he kicked a conversion and a penalty. This was to be the last game that Smith played, retiring aged 30.\nPersonal life.\nOn December 16, 1931, Dick married Nancie Alice Edwards. Nancie was born in 1913 to Alice Frances George Edwards and William James Edwards His wife Nancie and he had a son on March 18, 1937, at \"St Kilda, 239 Great North Road\".\nIt was reported that on the night of December 22, 1936, Smith was found in an illegal gaming premises known as the Albert Club on Wyndham Street. The venue was raided by a large number of detectives and \"29 men were arrested on gaming charges\". \"Walton Victor Roy Smith\" was fined in court \"£3 and costs\". The judge had fined those who pleaded guilty and had a clean record £1 which indicated that Smith was not a first time offender.\nThen in 1938 on February 11 Smith was 'caught' again in a \"raid on a gambling school on the second floor of the Queen's Arcade on Friday night\". There was a total of 28 arrests and “Walton Victor Roy Smith was fined £5 and costs” whilst most others were only fined £2 or £3 based on prior records.\nOn May 38, 1938, Dick's father Walton died suddenly. He was living at 50 Old Lake Road in Devonport at the time of his death. In his death notices his name was variously given as \"Walter\" and \"Walton\" with one stating that he was the “dearly beloved husband of Clara Evelyn Smith, and father of Fred, Dick and Jack, age 56 years. The funeral will leave the chapel of H. Morris Limited, at 11am. Monday for O'Neill's Point Cemetery” at Bayswater. The Auckland Star published an obituary for him which stated \"the death occurred at Devonport this morning of Mr. Walter Smith, a well known resident, and father of R. Smith and J. Smith, two well known North Shore Rugby League players, the latter being the full back chosen for the New Zealand League team to tour Australia. Mr. Smith was a brother of George Smith, the former well known Auckland footballer, who was a member of the original All Black team which toured Britain and Canada\".\nOn December 22, 1940, Dick's older brother Frederick drowned after leaping off the ketch Miena which he was a member of the crew of. The vessel had loaded cement at the Portland wharf in the Whangārei Harbour and was returning to Auckland. Frederick was seen to \"jump overboard and to attempt to swim to the shore, but he sank after swimming a short distance\". The Miena reversed its engines and a launch and dinghy were sent from the wharf but they failed to locate him. His body was recovered by the police near Portland wharf on December 25. The inquest found that he had accidentally drowned with another seaman giving evidence \"of an argument during loading\". The \"master of the vessel, Angus Matheson, said that he saw Smith deliberately dive into the sea when the ship was about 150 yds, from the Portland wharf, but with the strong tide against him he was unable to do so, and sank before help could reach him\". He was living at 9 Holiday Road, Milford, Auckland at the time and left behind a wife (Claire/Clara Isabell) and three daughters (Beverley, Valerie, and Shirley). His funeral was held at Morris' Chapel, Anne Street, Devonport on December 27 and he was buried at O'Neill's Point Cemetery.\nWalton Victor Roy (Dick) Smith died on July 2, 1964, aged 52. His address at the time of his death was 19 Great South Road, Remuera. He was cremated by Watney Sibun's Sons Ltd on July 6 at Purewa Cemetery in Meadowbank, Auckland with his ashes returned."

        "title": "1965 American Football League All-Star game",
        "text": "The 1965 All-Star Game was the AFL's fourth annual season-ending showpiece, which featured the outstanding performers from the 1964 season. A team drawn from the Western Division defeated their Eastern counterparts by a score of 38–14, scoring 21 unanswered points to pull away in the second half. The head coaches, Sid Gillman and Lou Saban, had faced each other in the 1964 AFL Championship game three weeks earlier, when Saban's Buffalo Bills had defeated Gillman's San Diego Chargers. Running back Keith Lincoln had suffered a cracked rib in that game, but recovered to score two long touchdowns and win the offensive MVP award in the All-Star game, as he had done in the previous year's edition. Defensive back Willie Brown of the Denver Broncos won the defensive MVP award.\nOriginally scheduled to take place in Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, the game had to be moved at short notice to Jeppesen Stadium, home of the Houston Oilers. The twenty-one African American players on the All-Star teams encountered numerous instances of racism in New Orleans during the build-up to the game, and voted to stage a boycott, with some white players saying they would join with and also boycott the game. In response, the AFL moved the game.\nThe game was televised by ABC, making it the final professional football game televised by the network until the debut of Monday Night Football in 1970.\nRosters.\nThe rosters were announced on December 30, 1964.\nBoycott.\nOn 21 May 1964, New Orleans businessman David Dixon met with the AFL owners to discuss various proposals that would bring football to his city. He hoped to host either postseason games or the All-Star game in Tulane Stadium, as a stepping stone to establishing a New Orleans franchise in either the AFL or the rival NFL. on 1 July, New Orleans were announced as hosts for the next All-Star game, which had previously been hosted by San Diego's Balboa Stadium.\nThe game was scheduled to take place six months after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which aimed to end racial segregation in the United States. Ten days prior to the game, Tulane Stadium had hosted the 1965 Sugar Bowl, which featured eight African American players and was the first Sugar Bowl to be completely integrated; this game went ahead without major incident. When the AFL All-Stars arrived in New Orleans the week before their game, however, the Black players encountered numerous problems, starting at the airport when they tried to hail taxis to take them to their hotels. White taxi drivers refused to give the players rides, or else took them to the wrong location. After reaching their hotels, some of the players went out to sample the French Quarter, but were greeted by overtly racist remarks, and acts such as having their coats taken from racks and thrown on the floor in restaurants. When a group tried to enter nightclub that was playing James Brown music, they were denied entry, with a doorman pointing a gun at Ernie Ladd.\nIn response to these incidents, all twenty-one Black players gathered to discuss their response in the Roosevelt Hotel, where the West team were stationed. While some wanted to go ahead with the game, Ladd and Cookie Gilchrist were influential figures in persuading the majority to boycott, which they opted to do after a vote. San Diego tackle Ron Mix tried to persuade the Black players to go ahead with the game, but they stood by their decision, with Clem Daniels stating that playing the game would serve to condone the treatment they had received. Mix then joined the boycott in a show of solidarity, as did Buffalo quarterback Jack Kemp.\nOn January 11, AFL Commissioner Joe Foss announced that due to the boycott, the game would be moved to Houston. Daniels, one of a handful of players who made statements, said, \"We are not wanted here so we are leaving.\"\nThe game.\nThe West took the lead on the first play from scrimmage, and kept it for the entire game. Len Dawson's long pass to Keith Lincoln covered 73 yards to open the scoring, though Dawson was knocked out of the game with a bloody nose on his next series. John Hadl replaced Dawson and doubled the lead with a touchdown to wide open Oakland receiver Clem Daniels early in the 2nd quarter. The East responded with a 10-play, 80-yard drive, with Sid Blanks scoring from the 5. Following a Tom Brooker field goal for the West, Nick Buoniconti forced a fumble by Abner Haynes, and returned the ball for a touchdown himself, making it 17–14 at halftime.\nLincoln scored again on the first West drive of the second half, taking a pitchout to the right and outpacing the defense for an 80-yard touchdown run. Later in the 3rd quarter, Hadl was intercepted by Butch Byrd, but the Buffalo defensive back attempted a lateral that was claimed by the West's Art Powell. Hadl and his San Diego teammate Lance Alworth connected for a touchdown on the next play. Hadl completed the scoring with his third touchdown pass, and second to a Raider, with Powell the recipient.\nEast kicker Gino Cappelletti had a difficult game, missing four kicks and having a fifth blocked (on another occasion, the East turned the ball over on downs after fake field goal didn't work). After the blocked kick, Jerry Maves picked up the ball and lateralled to Bobby Bell, who returned it 72 yards for an apparent touchdown, controversially ruled out as the lateral was ruled to have gone forwards. The West ran their advantage in the series to 4–0. They had a 362–189 offensive yardage advantage, including 153–7 in rushing yardage.\nAftermath.\nThe attendance of 15,446 in Houston was barely a quarter of the 60,000 that David Dixon had believed was attainable in New Orleans. Dixon feared that the incident would hinder New Orleans' plans to win an AFL franchise, either through expansion or through relocation of the Denver Broncos. There was speculation that Atlanta, a rival as a prospective pro football city, might be an indirect beneficiary, with Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. stating that what had happened in New Orleans would not have done so in his city. The AFL showed no interest in retrying New Orleans as a venue, instead announcing Houston and Oakland as the hosts of the next two All-Star games. NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, however, retained his interest in the city, and the franchise who would become known as the New Orleans Saints would be announced less than two years after the All-Star boycott, on 1 November 1966.\nReaction to the boycott was mixed in the days that followed it. A New Orleans sportswriter suggested that his city had been unfairly judged based on a handful of incidents, and implied that the players had come looking to cause trouble, and representatives of the city noted that the visiting Syracuse team had reported no problems; journalists from outside the city were more sympathetic to the African Americans' reaction, and noted that the Syracuse players had not mingled with the general populace to the same extent. In the years that followed, the boycott has been seen as a positive action that served as a catalyst for change in New Orleans. Butch Byrd, who had been among the Black players who still wanted to play the game during the meeting in the Roosevelt Hotel, later reflected, \"It didn't dawn on me until I read accounts in various newspapers and you could see what an event this really was. We had to take a stand.\""

        "text": "The Prairie View Cricket Complex (PVCC) is a group of six cricket grounds located in the Waller County neighborhood of Houston, Texas, United States. The facility is joint-owned by Tanweer Ahmed and Major League Cricket.\nHistory.\nIn January 2018, Houston developer David Wolff, along with Pakistani American businessman Tanweer Ahmed joint-purchased 86 acres of land in Prairie View, Texas to build a cricket complex. Construction on the complex started by March 2018, in which two cricket grounds were scheduled to open by April 2018. They opened four more cricket grounds in September 2018 as part of its first phase. Upon opening, the complex hosted three cricket matches of the Houston Cricket League. By July of 2022, a total of 14 cricket grounds were opened at the venue.\nIn May 2019, the United States national cricket team played its first match at this venue. By July of that same year, six cricket grounds had opened. Construction continued throughout September of that year, before ending and being ready for use in December 2019. For the first half of 2020, it would be used as a venue for the Houston Cricket League, before being used by the Houston Hurricanes as their home ground for the exhibition league of Minor League Cricket.\nIt served as the host of the Houston Open 2021 (which was sanctioned by USA Cricket) in early April of that year. It also hosted the United States Men's Under-19 National Championship, in which the Mid-Atlantic Zone were crowned champions. Later that month, it was also announced by USA Cricket that the venue would become the first official Major League Cricket National Cricket Center, and, as part of their joint-venture deal, they would add eight new turf practice nets and wickets, upgrading three cricket pitches to a high-quality natural turf wicket, and build a cricket pavilion, which would cater for both men and women players. It was also announced that Tanweer Ahmed, along with PVCC Head of Operations, Mangesh Chaudhari would be added to the investor group in Major League Cricket, and that they both would also co-own the Houston Hurricanes, which was announced in August of the same year. Additionally, the venue hosted a series of practice games between two Major League Cricket squads, and a United States Training Group. The practice series featured the likes of Corey Anderson, Sami Aslam, Dane Piedt and more. Similarly, it was the home ground to the Houston Hurricanes during the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket from July 31 to September 12, 2021.\nIt was also announced on August 28, 2021, that the venue would be the host of the inaugural USA Cricket national men's 50-over championship, which took place from November 15-19, 2021 (changed from a November 12-20 schedule due to the revised schedule of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier).\nIn March 2022, it was announced that the venue would undergo a $3 million renovation ahead of MLC and the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. In May 2022, the venue hosted warm-up and practice games ahead of 2 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 series at Moosa Stadium. Additionally, from June to July 2022, the venue was used again by the Hurricanes in their 2022 campaign of Minor League Cricket. In December of the same year, it was announced that the venue – alongside other venues such as Central Broward Stadium, Moosa Stadium, and the Grand Prairie Stadium – were likely to host matches in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.\nEvents.\nUpon opening in September 2018, the venue hosted matches of the Houston Cricket League throughout 2019 and 2020. The United States national cricket team played their first cricket match at this venue in May 2019. The following years, it was used as the Houston Hurricanes' home ground in both the exhibition league (in which Mayor David Allen was invited to see) and the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket. In April 2021, the venue hosted the \"USA Cricket-sanctioned\" Houston Open 2021, in which the Nepali Rhinos took the trophy. Later that month, it also hosted the United States Men's Under-19 National Championship, in which the Mid-Atlantic Zone was crowned champions. The same month, the venue hosted a series of practice matches between a United States Training Group and two Major League Cricket squads, which featured many international cricketers such as Shayan Jahangir, Dane Piedt, and others.\nIn August 2021, it was announced that the venue would be hosting the first inaugural United States Men's National Championship, which featured eight teams, and spanned from November 15-19, 2021 (changed from a November 12-20 schedule due to the revised schedule of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier).\nThe ground is set to host a total of 8 games in April and May 2024, with the United States playing Canada in a 5-match T20I series, and Bangladesh in a 3-match T20I series."

        "text": "The Women's C1 at the 2021 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships took place on 23 and 26 September 2021 at the Čunovo Water Sports Centre in Bratislava. It was the 9th official edition of the event, after it made its debut in 2010. 44 athletes from 22 nations competed.\nThe event was won by Elena Apel of Germany, securing her second medal of the Championships after she won silver in K1. Briton Mallory Franklin won silver for the fourth time, her fifth ever medal in this event. 2020 European Champion Gabriela Satková of the Czech Republic won bronze, her first individual medal at world championship level.\nBackground.\nAndrea Herzog of Germany entered the event as the reigning world champion, having taken the title in 2019 in La Seu d'Urgell. This was the first World Championships since women's C1 made its Olympic debut at Tokyo, where Jess Fox won gold ahead of Mallory Franklin and Herzog. Czech Tereza Fišerová came into the event having taken her first World Cup overall title after winning the final round in Pau. All four were favourites for the title as the highest ranked athletes by the ICF.\nCompetition format.\nThe women's C1 event in canoe slalom uses a three-round format with heats, a semifinal and final. Athletes complete up to two runs in the heats. In the first heat, the 20 fastest women qualify automatically for the semifinal, whilst the rest complete another run in the repêchage second heat for a further 10 qualification positions. The final rank of non-qualifying athletes is determined by their second run score. Athletes start in the reverse order of their heats position in the semifinal and complete a single run, with the top 10 advancing to the final. The athlete with the best time in the single-run final is awarded gold.\nPenalties of 2 or 50 seconds are incurred for infractions such as missing a gate, touching a gate, or not negotiating gates in numerical order. A team may request up to one review of a penalty per boat in the heats or semifinals phases, with no enquiries considered in the finals.\nResults.\nKimberley Woods set the fastest time in the first heat with a penalty-free 92.11. This was particularly significant, given she had been in a wheelchair a week earlier, following a car accident. Fellow countrywoman Mallory Franklin set the second fastest time, ahead of Australian Jessica Fox. World No. 5 Ana Sátila did not qualify directly to the semifinal after receiving a 50-second penalty but set the second fastest time of the day to win the second heat.\nThe Russian Canoe Federation's Alsu Minazova topped the semifinal with a time of 103.55 ahead of Angèle Hug of France. In an upset semifinal on a difficult course, Olympic Champion Fox, European Champion Miren Lazkano, World Cup overall winner Tereza Fišerová and reigning World Champion Andrea Herzog were all eliminated - the first two after incurring 50 second penalties. Fox' penalty meant that she would leave the World Championships without a medal in a canoe slalom event for the first time since 2011 and without making a final for the first time in her entire career.\nElena Apel of Germany backed up her silver medal in K1 by becoming the 2021 C1W World Champion in a time of 99.03, including a 2-second penalty. Olympic silver-medallist Franklin won silver, whilst 2020 European Champion Gabriela Satková took bronze. In a marked difference to the semifinal where just three athletes completed clean runs, only two athletes took penalties, including Apel.\nPenalties are included in the time shown. The fastest time in each round is shown in bold."

Nine teams from across Brisbane competed for the premiership, which culminated in a grand final match between the Redcliffe and Past Brothers clubs.\nSeason summary.\nThe format of the Winfield Cup was changed once again for the 1987 season, with games between Brisbane sides in the Winfield State League no longer granting competition points for the regular season. Instead, rounds 2 to 5 of the Woolies Pre-Season Competition were once again treated as first-grade games (Round 1, in which only 2 games were played, did not give competition points).\nTeams played each other twice, with 18 rounds of competition played. It resulted in a top four of Past Brothers, Northern Suburbs, Redcliffe and Wynnum-Manly. The 1987 season is significant as most Rugby League historians view it as the final season of the BRL as a true top tier competition, as the entry of the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast Giants into the NSWRL Premiership in 1988 devastated the BRL by stripping it of mainstream media coverage and players.\nPre-Season.\nThe 1987 Woolies pre-season competition took place over 5 rounds, from February 22 to March 22. Four competition points were available in each match, with one point going to the side that scored the most points in each half and two points to the winning side. Winfield Cup competition points were also available for teams that won games in rounds 2 through 5 of the pre-season. The pre-season final was held on March 29, between Brothers and Norths, both teams that had won all of their pre-season matches. The Brethren were without captain Trevor Bailey, who would also miss the Winfield State League and two rounds of the regular season. Second-row forward Gary Smith captained Brothers in Bailey's absence, the side winning 18-4 after taking the lead in the 33rd minute.\nLadder.\nSource:\nWoolies Trophy.\nThe 1987 Woolies Trophy match was held on August 2, as part of round 15 of the regular season. The Trophy was contested by Northern Suburbs and Wynnum-Manly, the teams that led the competition after the end of round 9.\nMatch details.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\nGrand Final.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\nWinfield State League.\nThe 1987 Winfield State League was the inaugural season of the Queensland Rugby League's statewide competition. A total of 14 teams competed in the season, 8 of which were BRL Premiership clubs. The remaining six were regional teams from across the state, hence the \"State League\" name. Wynnum Manly, Redcliffe, Brisbane Brothers and Toowoomba were the semi-finalists. Toowoomba were only the second non-Brisbane side to make the state league finals, but lost by 22 points to Wynnum-Manly in the semi-finals. The Seagulls faced Redcliffe in the State League Final for the second year in a row, winning 36-14."

The start to the regular season was delayed until November 13, 2020, and concluded on March 6, 2021. The conference tournament was held at the Compton Family Ice Arena in Notre Dame, Indiana.\nSeason.\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Big Ten season did not begin until mid-November, 6 weeks later than usual. As a result of the pandemic, the Big Ten only scheduled conference opponents during the regular season with one exception. Arizona State, an independent program, entered into a scheduling alliance with the Big Ten for this season. The group consented to play the full season on the road and forfeit its right to compete in the Big Ten tournament.\nThe regular season was highlighted by the prominence of Minnesota for most of the year and the scoring exploits of Cole Caufield. Caufield averaged a goal per game pace for the year and led both the Big Ten and the nation in both goals and points. The conference was able to earn 3 at-large bids for member schools, resulting in more than half of the Big Ten making the NCAA tournament. Unfortunately, while the conference was able to avoid too much trouble from COVID during the regular season, both Michigan and Notre Dame had players test positive just before their regional semifinal games and were forced to withdraw. As a result, their matchup with Boston College was ruled a no-contest and the Eagles automatically advanced to the Northeast Regional final. Similarly, on March 26, the NCAA announced Michigan was forced to withdraw as well due to COVID protocols. Minnesota provided the conference with its only tournament victory, defeating Omaha 7–2 before losing in the quarterfinals to in-state rival Minnesota State.\nAfter the season, Michigan made national headlines by having 3 players be drafted in the first five selections of the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. The Wolverines had an incoming freshman taken 4th overall as well.\nStatistics.\nLeading scorers.\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nLeading goaltenders.\n&lt;br&gt;\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\""

        "title": "Cycling in the Philippines",
        "text": "Cycling is a popular mode of transport and recreational sport in the Philippines.\nBicycles were first introduced to the archipelago in the 1880s during the Spanish colonial occupation of the Philippines and served as a common mode of transport, especially among the local \"mestizo\" population. In the present day, many of those who cycle in the country mainly do so as a mode of transport and as recreational activities, such as road racing, mountain biking, and recreational cycling. The popularity of cycling, however, was largely limited to local neighborhoods and rural towns as most urban areas were considered to be dangerous for cycling due to the dominance of motorized traffic with little to no cycling infrastructure for protection.\nHowever, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to the suspension and restriction of public transportation in the country, many Filipinos turned to cycling as an alternative mode of transportation, accelerating the development and promotion of active transportation infrastructure in urban areas.\nHistory.\nColonial era.\nBicycles were first introduced to the country in the 1880s, among other 20th century technologies introduced during the Spanish colonial occupation of the Philippines. American author Joseph Earle Stevens, who was living in Manila at the time, described cycling as a booming mode of transport on the streets of Manila, especially among the local \"mestizo \" population, as well as bicycle races that took place in Luneta, Manila in his journal entries in 1894. While in exile in Dapitan, Philippine national hero Jose Rizal wrote a letter on December 18, 1895, to his mother, requesting her to buy him a second-hand bicycle that he could use for his trips to town.\nFollowing the Spanish Empire's secession of the Philippines to the United States, bicycles made in the United States found their way into the local streets.\nOne of the earliest legislation on the regulation of bicycles was in 1901, where the Taft Commission under United States Army Provost Marshal General Arthur MacArthur Jr. approved City Ordinance No. 11, or \"An Ordinance Relating to the Use of the Public Streets and Places of Manila\" for the city of Manila. Under Section 21 of this ordinance, bicycles were regarded as vehicles on public streets and were to adhere to traffic ordinances and regulations. Bicycles were required to carry a bell, which was to be sounded when approaching a street intersection or crossing, or any vehicle or pedestrian occupying the street. Bicycles were also required to carry a light when in use during the night. Bicycle registration also took place, with over 2,000 bicycles being registered until registration was halted in 1906.\nThe use of bicycles as a recreational activity were marketed in the country as early as the 1920s, with a July 1926 issue of the Philippine Education Magazine promoting bicycle-riding as an economic mode of transport with health benefits.\nCommonwealth and WWII era.\nDuring the Commonwealth period, German engineer Frank Ephraim wrote in his autobiography \"Escape to Manila: From Nazi Tyranny to Japanese Terror\" that before the second World War in the Philippines, door-to-door salespeople using bicycles were a common sight on the streets of Manila. He also noted that bicycle theft was rampant during this period as bicycle owners would use heavier and more expensive chains and padlocks to prevent their bicycles from being stolen. This however, was often to no avail as bicycle thieves were typically able to cut the chains or pick the locks, a problem that still persists to the present day.\nIt was estimated that by 1942, there were over 12,750 bicycles being used as a mode of transport by Manila's then population of 9,000 people, including those in the outlying areas. During the second World War and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the Imperial Japanese Army used bicycle brigades during invasions and patrols, with each officer armed with a sheathed katana and a pistol.\nBy 1944, the occupying Japanese forces seized many carts, bicycles, tricycles, pedicabs, and pushcarts from the local population, crippling local public transportation.\nPost-WWII.\nSince then, the bicycle continued to serve as a mode of transport for Filipinos, but dwarfed by the growth of the automobile, motorized tricycles, and the jeepney as a primary mode of transport. As a result, the use of bicycles became more limited to areas with little motorized road traffic, as cycling remained popular as a sport and for cyclotourism.\nAs the road system and inefficient public transportation struggled to cope with population booms and increasing car ownership, people across different socioeconomic backgrounds turned to cycling as a mode of transport. However, the lack of cycling infrastructure in cities has caused many altercations between bicycles and motorized vehicles, leading to growing clamor for active transportation infrastructure to promote cycling as a safe and sustainable mode of transportation and alleviate traffic congestion in cities.\nIn 2002, the City of Marikina in Metro Manila initiated a bikeways program that was funded by a $1.3 million grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), a World Bank-supervised assistance program. A 52-kilometer bike lane network was eventually established in the city, making it the first city in Metro Manila to establish bicycle lanes.\nOn December 26, 2008, Philippine president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Executive Order No. 774 s. 2008, reorganizing the Presidential Task Force on Climate Change earlier established in 2007 to improve the country's response to the climate crisis. The order also created a Task Group on Fossil Fuels (TGFF), headed by the then-Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) to develop a new mobility paradigm favoring non-motorized locomotion, following the simple principle of \"those who have less in wheels must have more in road\". This was followed by Administrative Order No. 254 s. 2009, which mandated the DOTC and the TGFF to create a \"national environmentally sustainable transport strategy\" for the country. Later that year, these responsibilities were then absorbed by the Climate Change Commission (CCC) created through Republic Act No. 9729, or the Climate Change Act of 2009.\nLocal government units have since also implemented cycling infrastructure and initiatives in their own cities and municipalities, such as Marikina, Pasig, and Quezon City in Metro Manila, Iloilo City in Iloilo, and Vigan in Ilocos Sur, while other cities such as Mandaluyong included plans to establish bicycle routes around their cities.\nFrom 2012 to 2015, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) established bikeways along various roads in Metro Manila. The first was a bidirectional bike lane on Remedios Street and Remedios Circle in Manila, established on November 15, 2012. This was followed by bidirectional shared-use paths on Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City, Marikina-Infanta Highway in Marikina and Pasig, EDSA in Makati, and Roxas Boulevard in Manila. One-way shared-use paths were also established on EDSA in Quezon City, particularly from Ortigas Avenue to White Plains Avenue and along White Plains Avenue. The MMDA also established a bicycle-sharing system along designated control areas on EDSA between Ortigas Avenue and White Plains Avenue in Quezon City and between Ayala station and Magallanes station in Makati.\nThroughout 2018 and 2019, the Quezon City government also began establishing bicycle lanes along several major roads in the city. In an interview, Quezon City mayor Herbert Bautista also floated the idea of designating the inner roads of residential subdivisions as cycling corridors.\nOn February 7, 2019, the DPWH inaugurated the country's first protected bicycle lane along a national highway, located along the Laguna Lake Highway of Circumferential Road 6. The bicycle lane is a bi-directional bikeway spanning of the highway, and is physically separated from the highway with a planting strip.\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, public transport was suspended and subsequently reopened at a limited capacity. As a result, cycling as a mode of transport grew in popularity among Filipinos who needed means to go to and from their workplace safely and efficiently. This, alongside the decreased road traffic in many urban areas as a result of the community quarantine classifications led to the fast-tracked development of active transport infrastructure, such as protected bike lanes and bicycle parking amidst the pandemic, further encouraging bike ridership.\nWith the country transitioning into the looser general community quarantine and in anticipation of people returning to work, the MMDA, in coordination with cyclists and scooter riders pushing for permanent active transport infrastructure, conducted a dry run of pop-up bicycle lanes along EDSA, the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila on July 3, 2020, coinciding with World Bicycle Day. The agency also vowed to support the provision of bicycle lanes across the metropolis.\nOn August 19, 2020, the Department of Health, Department of Transportation, Department of the Interior and Local Government, and Department of Public Works and Highways through Joint Administrative Order No. 0001 s. 2020 issued guidelines on the proper use and promotion of active transport amidst and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn September 15, 2020, the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act provided recovery and resilience interventions and mechanisms related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The act declared the need to accommodate alternative modes of transportation, including bicycle lanes on all roads in cities, municipalities, and provinces. It authorized the President of the Philippines to exercise powers necessary to provide emergency pathways, bicycle sharing schemes with safety equipment, and pop-up bicycle lanes, particularly for health workers and other frontliners. Through the act, the Department of Transportation was allocated billion to develop accessible sidewalks and protected bicycle lanes, bicycles for distribution, safety equipment, and bicycle racks.\nOn November 18, 2020, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte signed Presidential Proclamation No. 1052 s. 2020, declaring every fourth Sunday of November as \"National Bicycle Day\". The proclamation provides legitimacy to the \"National Bicycle Day\" initially organized by the National Bicycle Organization, a non-government organization that hosted the event annually since 2014.\nOn May 11, 2021, the Land Transportation Office released LTO Administrative Order No. 39 s. 2021, defining the classification, registration, and operation of electric vehicles. The order allows personal mobility scooters, electric kick scooters, and light electric vehicles under classifications L1a and L2a to use bicycle lanes.\nThe Department of Transportation announced on November 28, 2021, coinciding with National Bicycle Day, that it would be working with Google to push for the inclusion of the nationwide bicycle lane network into Google Maps.\nOn April 15, 2022, the Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act, which was passed to promote the manufacturing and use of electric vehicles, declared the need to provide options for micromobility through light electric vehicles (LEVs). The act states that local government units should provide segregated lanes for LEVs on all major local and national roads, which may be integrated with bicycle lanes. This is to be done in coordination with the Department of Public Works and Highways.\nIn December 2022, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) approved the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) for 2023 to 2028, which outlined that pedestrians and cyclists should be accorded the highest priority among all road users in transport-related infrastructure.\nRecent developments.\nOn November 28, 2023, Philippine president Bongbong Marcos signed Proclamation No. 409 s. 2023, declaring the last working day of November as \"National Bike to Work Day\".\nOn February 21, 2024, the LTO released LTO Administrative Order No. 44 s. 2024, amending sections of LTO Administrative Order No. 39 s. 2021, requiring all electric vehicles, including electric bicycles and scooters to be registered when used on public roads.\nBicycle lane network.\nThe nationwide bicycle lane network of the Philippines was established during the COVID-19 pandemic in response to the popularity of cycling as a mode of transport and to encourage the use of bicycles and other light mobility vehicles as a safe, healthy, and sustainable means of mobility.\nThroughout 2021, the Department of Transportation and Department of Public Works and Highways established the Metropolitan Bike Lane Networks, consisting of paint-delineated and physically-protected bicycle lanes and other bicycle-related infrastructure in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and Metro Davao. It is also known as the Bayanihan II Bike Lane Networks as it was funded through the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act. The Metropolitan Bike Lane Networks were inaugurated on July 28, 2021 with a total of of bicycle lanes in the country's metropolitan areas: in Metro Manila, in Metro Cebu, and in Metro Davao.\nAs of March 2023, the Department of Transportation has established of bicycle lanes since 2020, with plans to expand the network to within the year. The DOTr plans to establish new bicycle lanes in the Ilocos Region, Central Luzon, Metro Manila, Southern Tagalog, Bicol Region, Western Visayas, Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, and Davao Region, with the national government planning to build a total of of bicycle lanes nationwide by the end of the presidency of Bongbong Marcos in 2028.\nBicycle lane classifications.\nThe Department of Public Works and Highways and the Department of Transportation through DPWH Department Order No. 88 series of 2020 defines bicycle lanes into three classes, based on prevailing road and traffic conditions. The order also provides that all new road and bridge construction and expansion projects must incorporate bicycle lanes with an absolute minimum width of These guidelines were then updated in December 2022 through DPWH Department Order No. 263 series of 2022.\nUnder these guidelines, the maximum slope grade of all bicycle lane crossings and Class I bicycle lanes should not exceed 5 percent, while Class II and Class III bicycle lanes must follow the slope grade of the roadway. In addition, Class I and Class II bicycle lanes have a maximum speed limit of and are exclusive to the use of non-motorized vehicles and light electric vehicles with a maximum vehicle weight of .\nThese guidelines only apply to bicycle lanes set up by the national government and as such do not apply to bicycle lanes set up by local government units or private developments.\nClass I.\nClass I bicycle lanes are shared use paths or bike paths, which are designated paths completely separated from the roadway that are designated for the exclusive use of bicycles or shared with pedestrians.\nThe minimum clear width of a Class I bicycle lane is , which may be widened to in high traffic areas or briefly narrowed to at narrow road sections. Class I bicycle lanes are separated from motor vehicle roadways by open spaces, have line markings delineating the paths for cycling and pedestrian traffic, and are recommended on roads with high traffic volume (annual average daily traffic or AADT of 6,000 to 8,000 vehicles or more) and an operating speed of or higher.\nClass II.\nClass II bicycle lanes are separated bicycle lanes on a portion of the road for the exclusive use of bicycles. These are divided into Class IIa bicycle lanes, which uses physical separation, and Class IIb bicycle lanes, which uses pavement markings. \nA unidirectional Class II bicycle lane has a minimum clear width of or briefly narrowed to at narrow road sections. Class IIa bicycle lanes are distinguished by physical separation using bollards, curbs, plant boxes, concrete barriers, or a median strip with elevation changes, while Class IIb bicycle lanes are distinguished by green and white pavement markings using paint.\nPavement markings are recommended on roads with low to moderate traffic volume (AADT of 3,000 to 6,000 vehicles) and an operating speed of , while physical separation is recommended on roads with high traffic volume (an AADT of 6,000 to 8,000 vehicles or more) and an operating speed of or higher. Class II bicycle lanes may also be supplemented with a buffer zone between the bicycle lane and other road lanes.\nClass III.\nClass III bicycle lanes are shared roadways, which are roads used by motor vehicles but are officially designated as bicycle routes.\nThese are placed on roads with a lane width of , operating speeds not exceeding , low volume of traffic (AADT of not more than 3,000 vehicles), and limited carriageway width. These routes are distinguished by signs encouraging road users to be mindful of cyclists. Class III bicycle lanes may also contain brief sections of non-exclusive painted bicycle lanes with broken lines to limit the movement of cycling traffic on narrow roads.\nClass III bicycle lanes may also be used as temporary bicycle lanes until more appropriate infrastructure can be implemented.\nPrivate developments.\nMany mixed-use developments and planned communities owned and managed by private real estate companies across the country have also incorporated bicycle lanes in their developments. These bicycle lanes are typically not within the jurisdiction of the national or local governments but may be integrated into existing networks. \nSome examples of private developments with bicycle lanes include Bonifacio Global City in Taguig, the Megaworld Corporation's Arcovia City and Ortigas Land's Capitol Commons in Pasig, and the Nuvali development of Ayala Land in Laguna. Bicycle lanes are also present along Ayala Avenue, the main road of the Makati Central Business District in Makati. Additionally, some shopping malls also have bicycle lanes in their vicinity, such as those at the SM Mall of Asia in Pasay and SM Seaside City in Cebu City of SM Supermalls.\nHigher education instutitions in the Philippines have also incorporated bicycle lanes within their campuses, such as in University of the Philippines Diliman, Ateneo de Manila University, and De La Salle University – Laguna Campus.\nBicycle use and ownership.\nMMUTIS Capacity Enhancement Project.\nAs part of the MMUTIS Capacity Enhancement Project (MUCEP) of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the then-Department of Transportation and Communications, several household interviews on transport characteristics and patterns were conducted in Metro Manila from 2012 to 2014. The data from the MUCEP database reveals that 3,233 respondents from the household interviews made trips using bicycles. The respondents were predominantly male with a 12:1 ratio, consisted mainly of people from the 19 to 59 years old age brackets, and were mostly made by individuals with a personal monthly income of less than . Blue-collar workers comprised the majority of these respondents at 75.5 percent of respondents while white-collar workers only comprised 7.6 percent of respondents. Lastly, it was found that most respondents owned at least one bicycle and that the majority of them did not own a car or motorcycle.\nProject KaLakBay.\nIn partnership with the Department of Transportation, the KaLakBay (\"Ka-Lakad at Baysikleta\") Project conducted bicycle counts for 16 hours on April 22, 2022 and road-side route choice surveys on April 22 and 29, 2022 along several major roads in Metro Manila.\nThe bicycle counts counted 37,529 cyclists, most of which were male with a 25:1 ratio. It was also observed that 61.9 percent of were wearing helmets, in which higher helmet usage was observed in cities with bicycle helmet laws such as in Quezon City and Valenzuela.\nA total of 748 respondents were interviewed for the route choice surveys. Most respondents were also male with a 15:1 ratio, consisted of at least high school and college graduates, were mostly full-time employed, and were predominantly from individuals with a personal monthly income of less than . Survey respondents also predominantly use bicycles for work and home-errands, with 46 percent of trips made under 30 minutes and 37 percent of trips made within 1 to 2 hours. The surveys also reveal that only a third of respondents began cycling during the pandemic, with most not owning a car or motorcycle, and would take public transport when not using their bicycles. Most respondents also cycled for leisure at least once or twice a week. Over 90 percent of respondents stated that their workplaces had bicycle parking, while only 29 percent of respondents had workplaces with locker rooms and only 15 percent of respondents had workplaces with showers.\nSocial Weather Stations.\nSince 2020, the Social Weather Stations has conducted 13 surveys nationwide assessing the ownership and use of bicycles as a mode of transportation and as a recreational activity.\nThe latest survey, conducted from March 26 to 29, 2023, finds that 36 percent of households (an estimated 10 million households) in the Philippines use bicycles for any activity, up from 29 percent in April 2022. The latest survey also finds that 24 percent of households (an estimated 6.6 million households) own bicycles, up from 23 percent in April 2022. Throughout the 13 surveys, it was also reported that more households own bicycles than four-wheeled motor vehicles, such as cars, vans, electric cars, jeepneys, or electric jeepneys and three-wheeled motor vehicles such as motorized and electric tricycles. However, it states that are more households nationwide that own two-wheeled motor vehicles such as motorcycles and electric bicycles.\n&lt;section begin=\"ownership-chart\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"ownership-chart\" /&gt;\nThe March 2023 survey also reveals that among the 36 percent of households that use bicycles, 24 percent percent of households use them for essential activities, up from 21 percent in April 2022 and 19 percent in May 2021. On the other hand, 27 percent of households that use bicycles use them for recreational activities, up from 18 percent in April 2022 and 19 percent in May 2021.\nAdditionally, the March 2023 survey also shows that of the 36 percent of cycling households, 23 percent use their own bicycles while 13 percent use borrowed bicycles. This is up from 23 percent using their own bicycles and 6 percent using borrowed bicycles as reported in the April 2022 survey.\nIntermodal transport and parking.\nThe use of bicycles as transportation is supported by the inclusion of bicycle parking racks in schools, retail stores, shopping centers, parks and plazas, and transport stops. The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) outlines that short term bicycle parking facilities such as bicycle parking racks, bicycle parking sheds, and bicycle repair stations should be located to such establishments, including the presence of trip-end facilities. It also outlines the inclusion of long-term bicycle parking facilities such as bicycle lockers for all-day or overnight bicycle parking.\nEducation institutions such as the Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University, and the University of Santo Tomas provide bicycle racks on their respective campuses that are free of charge for visitors, students, faculty, and staff. In addition to bicycle racks, the University of the Philippines Diliman has a bicycle-sharing system run by UP Bike Share, a student-led organization.\nOn November 8, 2009, the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA) inaugurated its \"Bike On, Bike Off\" or \"Bike O2\" project, allowing folding bicycles to be brought onto Line 1 and Line 2 trains for free to promote bimodal transportation to reduce traffic on the road. Folding bikes are allowed onboard trains provided that they do not exceed the LRTA's baggage size limitations of . After much persuasion from folding bike groups, this was followed by the MRT Line 3 also allowing folding bikes to be brought into trains on February 1, 2012, albeit only for folding bikes with wheels not more than in diameter.\nIn 2020, bicycle racks were installed at Line 1, 2, and 3 stations, as well as on stations of the PNR Metro Commuter Line. The Philippine National Railways allows folding bicycles to be brought on its trains with the bicycle being charged as equivalent to the fare of one person. The Pasig River Ferry Service, operated by the MMDA, allows both folded and full-sized bicycles to be carried onboard free of charge.\nSeveral pedestrian footbridges and underpasses have also been outfitted with bicycle ramps to allow cyclists to bring their bicycles on them, particularly in Quezon City.\nSport and recreation.\nIn the Philippines, people who cycle as a sport are usually grouped by those who cycle as part of triathlon events, those who cycle for tourism, those who cycle for exercise on weekends, and those who cycle within the vicinity of their neighborhoods.\nRoad cycling tours are usually held annually by different sports institutions in the country, often spanning long distances such as from Manila to Baguio. These include the annual Le Tour de Filipinas, Ronda Pilipinas, and PRUride Philippines.\nIn the 1990s, mountain biking grew in popularity as a recreational weekend activity, especially among Filipino yuppies. The province of Rizal is home to several popular mountain biking trails, particularly in its provincial capital of Antipolo. Other popular trail locations can also be found in the city of Tagaytay in Cavite, and the Nuvali real-estate development in Laguna.\nIn 2023, the Ateneo de Manila Senior High School has started offered cycling as a PE elective. In that same year, De La Salle University - Dasmariñas Senior High School announced that it would offer a PE elective as well in the upcoming school year.\nReception.\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of attention to developing bicycle infrastructure in the Philippines had been a point of criticism for cyclists and mobility advocates clamoring for alternative modes of transportation. These individuals and groups cited the high levels of traffic congestion caused by private motor vehicles and overcrowding on public transport in urban areas as reasons for prioritizing the development of cycling infrastructure.\nAs a result, when the Philippine government increased its focus on active transport infrastructure during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, this was met with support from the public. In support, mobility advocacy groups also called for stronger policies that would support a sustainable and inclusive public transportation system, while also helping provide input on the development of national guidelines for the proper use and promotion of active transport during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBacklash from motorists.\nThe implementation of a national bicycle lane network in the Philippines has faced criticism from both motorists and cyclists. Some motorists have argued that the addition of bicycle lanes on major roads has resulted in the removal of lanes previously dedicated to motor vehicles, leading to increased traffic congestion and longer travel times. Cyclists have also criticized the design of the bicycle lane network and the apparent reluctance of the government to prioritize the development of infrastructure for public and active transportation over infrastructure for motor vehicles.\nConcerns were also raised on the placement of bicycle lanes, with some being overlaid onto existing road lanes rather than being integrated as part of a reconfiguration of the road. This raised concerns about confusion among road users and an increased risk of accidents involving both cyclists and motorists.\nIn December 2022, motoring journalist James Deakin wrote a column in the \"Manila Bulletin\" where he labeled the national government's bicycle lane network as a \"failed experiment\" due to the \"half lane\" design and proliferation of motorcycles in the bicycle lanes, which he attributes the latter as one of the reluctances of Filipinos to consider cycling as a mode of transport. Deakin suggested that the bicycle lane should be \"salvaged\" into a motorcycle lane or removed completely to give \"back to cars\", which drew criticism online. Voice-over artist and content creator Inka Magnaye, in response to Deakin's column, showed annoyance at the \"bandaid solution\" design of the bicycle lanes, urging the need to improve them to be safer for cyclists and motorists alike. However, her remarks were interpreted as a criticism against bicycle lanes, sparking multiple discussions online on road safety for drivers and cyclists alike\nBicycle-related accidents.\nDue to the growing popularity of cycling brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of bicycle-related road accidents have also increased.\nIn a column in \"The Manila Times\" in June 2020, then-Manila mayor Isko Moreno expressed his reluctance in complying with the national government's directive to put up bicycle lanes in Manila, stating that the city streets are too dangerous to normalize cycling on due to the presence of unruly motorists and \"gargantuan\" trucks. Cycling advocacy group Cycling Matters responded to Moreno's column, criticizing his arguments for complaining about the unsafe conditions for cyclists while not taking the \"long overdue responsibility\" to make Manila's roads safer for them.\nThe Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) reported a total of 1,759 accidents in 2019, which had increased to 2,503 accidents in 2020, and slightly decreased to 2,397 accidents in 2021 along major roads within its jurisdiction. Most of these accidents were reported to be non-fatal and a third of these were reported as damage to property. The MMDA has noted, however, that its data as of 2020 has since included road accidents involving pedicabs and electric bicycles. Many of these accidents have been attributed to a lack of protected bicycle lanes and traffic calming measures to allow bicycles to safely navigate through heavily congested roads.\nObstacles along bicycle lanes.\nSince the establishment of the nationwide bicycle lane network, motorists have complained that cyclists and other non-motorized transport users often leave or do not use the bicycle lanes, causing these users to go on open roads. However, many cyclists have also aired their grievances on social media on obstacles within the bicycle lanes, ranging from potholes, puddles, metal sheets covering roadworks, dangerous drain covers, utility poles, parked vehicles, and motor vehicles entering unprotected segments of the bicycle lanes to turn or overtake. As a result, cyclists often go in and out of the bicycle lanes around these obstacles or avoid using the bicycle lanes completely. Cycling advocates have also argued that bicycle lanes are not meant to \"cage\" cyclists into bicycle lanes but to keep motor vehicle users out of them."

The Puerto Rico men's national 3x3 team has won medals in the Pan American and Central American and Caribbean Games.\nNational program.\nSummer Youth Olimpics.\nThe first FIBA Americas workshop for the 3x3 initiative was held in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on August 13, 2012, counting with the participation of federations from Brasil, Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala, Venezuela, Dominican Republic and the host. The first worldwide implementation of the format came at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, where the \"Federación de Baloncesto de Puerto Rico\" assembled a team that ran parallel to the junior national team but did not rely on its players, composed of Kristian Medina, Ónix Collazo, Ángel Torres and Abdiel Badillo.\nPuerto Rico opened with a 33–15 victory over India. However, the team then lost a series of close games to European adversaries, the first against Greece by two points, the second to New Zealand by four points and the last one to eventual gold medallist, Serbia, by a single point. In the next round, Puerto Rico opened by defeating Egypt 29–16 and Turkey 30–28 to advance, before losing the final game to the Philippines. The first FIBA tournament was the 2011 FIBA 3x3 Youth World Championship, to which the team remained the same except for Kevin Ramiu replacing Badillo.

The team's first participation was at the New York Master.\nSan Juan won its opening game over NY Bronx with scores of 21–7. To complete the round robin they defeated Team Dallas (21–17), Team Edmonton (16–12) and Team Orlando (21–15). San Juan won its quarterfinals draw over Team Minnesota with scores of 14–13. Their next opponent was Team Moscow, whom they defeated 17–15. In the finals, the team lost to Team Denver 17–19 on a last-second three-point basket, but classified for the 3x3 World Tour Finals. Held in Miami, the event began on September 21, 2012, and lasted three days, gathering the top-four teams from the New York, São Paulo, Vladivostok, Insatnbul and Madrid Masters. Their first draw in this stage was the wild card qualifier Team Miami, whom they defeated 16–8. In their next appearance, San Juan earned a 16–13 victory over Bucharest UPB.

The team won the first stage by besting Team Miami (21–7), Team Toronto (14:13) and NY Queens (20:16). Two other local squads joined in this edition.

        "text": "The 2021–22 Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey season was the 80th season of play for the program. They represented Michigan State University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. This season marked the 32nd season in the Big Ten Conference. They were coached by Danton Cole, in his fifth season, and played their home games at Munn Ice Arena.\nSeason.\nMichigan State began the season well, posting a winning record through the first month of the season. After dropping both games to arch-rival Michigan, the Spartans dipped below .500 but they responded with four consecutive wins to get back onto the plus side of the ledger. MSU ended the first half of their season with a split against Notre Dame, putting them in a strong position to make a run for a home game in the postseason.\nUnfortunately, both the team's offense and defense faltered in the back half of their campaign and the Spartans lost 13 consecutive games. Both goaltenders played during the stretch and performed well, but neither received much help. MSU allowed an average of 37 shots per game, while recording just 27 of their own. While most of their losses were against ranked teams, that would provide little solace as Michigan State finished last in the conference for the fourth time in five years.\nThey faced Michigan in the first round of the conference tournament and were thoroughly beaten, losing both games by a combined 1–12 score.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Those 10 teams are determined based upon the PairWise rankings. The rankings take into account all games played but are heavily affected by intra-conference results. The result is that teams from leagues which perform better in non-conference are much more likely to receive at-large bids even if they possess inferior records overall.\nAs a conference, the Big Ten had a tremendous non-conference season. Only one of the seven league members (Wisconsin) had a losing record in non-league games. Four teams had at least an 80% winning percentage. On the whole, only one conference possessed a winning record against the Big Ten (NCHC), however, they did so by only one victory.\nStatistics.\nLeading scorers.\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nLeading goaltenders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\""

        "text": "The 1939 Auckland Rugby League season was its 31st.\nMount Albert United won their first ever Fox Memorial Shield title with a 13 win, 1 draw, 2 loss record. North Shore Albions were 6 competition points further back. After 12 rounds Mount Albert (17) trailed North Shore (18) by one competition point before North Shore could only secure a win and a draw from their last 5 matches while Mount Albert won all five to run away with the title.\nMarist Old Boys beat Mount Albert in the Roope Rooster final 13–11. This was the 5th time Marist had won the Roope Rooster. A week later Mount Albert beat Marist 15–9 to win the Stormont Shield (champion of champions) for the first time. City Rovers won the Phelan Shield when they beat Richmond Rovers 15–12 in the final. This was the first time they had won the Phelan Shield which was played for by teams knocked out of the Roope Rooster in the first two rounds.\nRichmond won the reserve grade competition ahead of Mount Albert and Ponsonby United. They also won the reserve grade knockout competition (Stallard Cup) when they beat Otahuhu Rovers in the final. Otahuhu had competed in the senior B grade but asked to compete for the Stallard Cup after they had won the senior B championship (Sharman Cup). Otahuhu also won the senior B knockout competition beating Ellerslie United 5–3 in the final. Ellerslie claimed the Foster Shield.\nThe representative season to an extent was focussed on helping the selectors choose the New Zealand team to tour England and France. Auckland played matches against South Auckland and Wellington while the traditional Inter-Island match was also played at Carlaw Park. Two New Zealand trial matches were played at the same venue and were heavily populated by Auckland players. The Tāmaki (Auckland Māori) side played 2 matches against Auckland Pākehā with the sides splitting them, one win a piece. On June 11 the Māori side played South Auckland in Huntly with the South Auckland team winning. They also played the first ever Bay of Plenty Māori side for the Waitangi Shield with the teams deadlocked 3–3 at full time. Another Waitangi Shield defence was scheduled for August 31 but was postponed due to bad weather. It was then cancelled altogether because of petrol restrictions due to the looming outbreak of war meaning the Taranaki Māori side couldn't get a license to travel. At the start of the season an Eastern Suburbs side (though with several players from other clubs) visited Auckland and played 4 matches against Auckland club sides. They beat Marist (22-9), lost to Richmond (16-17), lost to Mount Albert (11-16), and then beat Manukau (23-10).\n \n \nAuckland Rugby League news.\nAnnual meeting.\nThe report presented at the annual meeting on March 8 stated: \"there was again a marked increase in revenue from gate and grandstand receipts and ground rates, the respective figures being: 1937, £3410; 1938, £3761 18s 5d [with] the tour of the Sydney Eastern Suburbs team [being] a material factor in this increase. There had been an increase in expenditure from £160 to £312 due to the increased length of the season, more travel, and more insurance payments to cover injured players hospital treatment. The surplus for the season to be transferred to the appropriation account was £1439\". Grants to clubs had amounted to £628 4s 7d. Mention was also made of the loss of several “notable stalwarts, including the late Messrs. Charles Seagar, William James Liversidge, T. Bellamy, and R. Badiley”. The annual meeting was held on March 8 with Mr. John A. Lee, M.P. presiding. He said that “the code was steadily progressing so far as the quality of players and public esteem were concerned”. Ivan Culpan was congratulated on reaching his twenty-first year in office. Mr. G. Grey Campbell referred to the generosity of vice-president, Mr. R.H. Wood who had presented “the handsome Edith Wood Roll of Honour for the inscription of the names of men who had given 25 years of continuous special service. The gift was dedicated to the memory of the donor's wife. The memorial was draped with the flags of all the clubs”. Election of officers were as follows:-Patron Mr. J.F.W. Dickson; president, Mr. John A. Lee, M.P.; vice-presidents, Sir Ernest Davis, Messrs. J. Donald, C. Drysdale, H. Grange, R.J. Land, W.J. Lovatt, E. Morton, Frederick William Schramm, M.P., W.

Bridgman. Following R. Doble's July appointment as co-manager of the New Zealand team to tour England and France a reshuffle was needed of officials at Auckland Rugby League. Mr. Francis Thomas McAneny was asked to deputise on the New Zealand Council pending a permanent appointment. Mr. E. Chapman was chosen as Press and call steward at Carlaw Park and Mr. Probert was elected to the insurance committee.\nJunior Control Board.\nTheir annual report from the 1938 season stated that 55 teams took part in junior competitions with 1123 players registered. The ladies social committee “paid over 200 visits to the sick and needy” with many players expressing their “thanks for their generosity and kindness”. The ladies committee also managed all the social functions of the control board. In 1937 club delegates had formed the Amalgamated Senior Clubs' Officers Association and through their efforts £300 had been contributed to help players in need.\nHonours board.\nAt the control board meeting on February 15 “consideration was given to the list of names to be inscribed on the honours’ board, which will be a record of those who have given 25 years of continuous service to the code in Auckland\". At their March 1 meeting chairman Campbell “stated that the roll of honour … would be unveiled at the annual meeting” the following week. At the annual meeting on March 8 the memorial was unveiled with the names being D.W. Mclean, founder of the New Zealand Rugby League, and James Carlaw (deceased), Messrs. Ernie Asher, R.H. Benson, A.J. Ferguson, Ivan Culpan, B Longbottom, C. Raynes, A. Campney, Freeman Thompson, W.J. Liversidge, W. Mincham, and M.J. Hooper. Chairman Campbell said that other names were to be added. On August 7 Mr. W. Mincham reported that the name of Mr. Les Edgar Bull was being added to the Roll of Honour board. He was the association president and had been a key figure in Auckland refereeing for many years.\nPre-season.\nAt the board of control meeting on February 22 it was decided to notify clubs that Carlaw Park “would be available for regular training after next Saturday and to engage a coach to attend the park to conduct free physical culture and loosening exercises for players from 7:30 pm to 8pm tonight week and the following Tuesday and Thursday evenings” with “his services open to all players”. At the same meeting the board congratulated Verdun Scott of the North Shore Albions who had scored a record 235 not out recently in club cricket.\nSydney combined side tour.\nIt was organised that the Balmain club would tour Auckland playing three matches over the Easter weekend before returning to Australia to begin their season. A week later however the club informed the authorities in New Zealand that they would not be able to come as \"several players were not available\". The Auckland Rugby League then engaged in a “lengthy radio-telephone conversation with Australia” on February 15 that left them “practically certain that one of the leading club teams of Sydney will play at Carlaw Park at Easter in lieu of Balmain”. Ray Stehr of Eastern Suburbs had also been reported as saying that he could get together a very strong composite team made up of Eastern Suburbs and Balmain players to tour. The team was eventually granted permission to tour and four matches were arranged for Carlaw Park against Marist, Richmond, Mount Albert, and Manukau. The touring side was particularly strong and included good players from several clubs: Jim Sharman, J. Robinson (W. Suburbs), Frank Hyde, Jim Quealey, Jack Redman, Frank Griffiths, George Watt (Balmain), Roy Thompson (N. Sydney), Don Manson (S. Sydney), Aub Mitchell (Canterbury-Bankstown), Fred Tottey, Rod O'Loan, Laurie Pickup, Jack McCarthy, Jack Arnold, Harry Pierce, and Ray Stehr (E. Suburbs). The tour raised £300 for the injured players fund.\nBefore the kickoff of the first match between Marist and Sydney XIII both teams stood in silence and wore arm bands as a mark of respect for the late Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Joseph Lyons who had died in office 13 days earlier on April 7. Robert Grotte was sent off for Marist and was later suspended for 2 games. John Anderson, normally one of the most reliable place kickers in New Zealand missed 5 first half shots at goal and another in the second half, while Murdoch also missed one.\nBroadhead had to leave the field injured early in the second half for Richmond. A relay race was run during the afternoon between 4 senior club teams including the Sydney side. The Ponsonby team won by 2 yards ahead of Sydney with Brian Riley, Arthur Kay, Jack Campbell, and Pat Young running for the winners.\nHarold Milliken, Dave Solomon and Bruce Donaldson switch codes.\nIt was reported on March 21 that Harold Milliken, an All Black in 1937-38 was moving from Christchurch to Auckland and would play for the Papakura club. At the same time the Auckland rugby representative five eighth, Bruce Donaldson also switched codes and joined the Mount Albert side. He ultimately topped the point scoring for the season with 117 points. On May 20 Dave Solomon who had played for the All Blacks in 1935-36 switched to rugby league and joined Richmond. He debuted for them in their May 20 match with Papakura.\nReturn of Bob Banham, George Nepia, and Hawea Mataira.\nBob Banham the Australian who had been recruited by Auckland Rugby League in 1938 as a player-coach was returning to Auckland for the 1939 season. The previous year he had played and coached at North Shore Albions (5 games), and City Rovers (12 games), with 2 other appearances for Newton Rangers as a guest. Mount Albert United had secured his services as a player coach. Hawea Mataira, who had played for City Rovers in 1937 before returning to the East Coast for 1938 was once again back in Auckland and playing for his former side. George Nepia had also returned to Auckland to play for Manukau Rovers. He had played for them briefly in 1938 before leaving for Gisborne after he pulled out of the New Zealand team to tour Australia for personal reasons. He was joining Manukau as a player-coach.\nNewmarket Rugby League Football Club revival.\nOn February 6 a special meeting was held at the Municipal Hall for the Newmarket Rugby League Football Club and they were “revived” as a result. The mayor of Newmarket was presiding over the meeting. The Auckland Rugby League granted them affiliation as a junior club. The club had last fielded junior teams in 1931 when they won the 6th grade A competition, after starting out with a solitary schoolboys side in 1926.\nCarlaw Park.\nImprovements were made to the Carlaw Park entrance gates with the work completed by May 6 at a cost of £200. Work was also intended to be carried out on the “eastern end of the grandstand, to prevent rain beating in”.\nObituaries.\nWilliam James Barningham Liversidge.\nOn December 26, 1938, William Liversidge had a heart attack and died in the pavilion of the Auckland Bowling Club whilst competing in a bowls tournament. He was aged just 50 at the time of his death. Liversidge was a member of the Men's fours national champions in 1935 from the Grey Lynn club along with Auckland referee and father of Ted Mincham, William Mincham. He had been involved in Auckland rugby league \"since its inception\" and was a life member of the Auckland Rugby League. He had also been on the committee of the Maritime Football Club from 1919 onwards. At the Auckland control board meeting on February 2 chairman Campbell said that \"Mr Liversidge was a progressive administrator of ability and for many years had served the game well, giving keen support to the Auckland League as well as to the national management\". Liversidge was an employee of the waterworks department of the City Council. He was buried at Waikumete Cemetery on the 28th.\nRepresentative season.\nAt the control board meeting on March 15 there were four nominations for the three positions of Auckland selectors. As the result of a ballot Messrs. Hec Brisbane, Bert Avery, and Bill Cloke were elected. Auckland played two matches, the first against South Auckland (Waikato) on August 5 resulting in a 26–17 win while they defeated Wellington 23–9 on September 2. An Auckland Pākehā side played the Tamaki (Auckland Māori) side on two occasions with the Māori side winning the first 19-15 (June 5), and the Pākehā \nside the second 15-12 (September 30). The Māori side also played a Bay of Plenty Māori team on August 24 with the match drawn 3-3. Other matches were played by Māori teams against South Auckland sides but the results were not well reported. They were also scheduled to play against the Taranaki Māori side but the match was postponed due to the weather and then cancelled due to government imposed petrol restrictions with war looming. the annual inter-island match between the North Island and South Island was also played at Carlaw Park and was won 35-13 by the North Island which was dominated by Auckland players as was the norm. There were also 2 New Zealand trial matches played at Carlaw Park again featuring a large number of Auckland players.\nAuckland players chosen for New Zealand tour of England and France.\nIn July the New Zealand team to tour England and France was named in 3 stages. The following players from Auckland were selected:- Bob Banham (Mount Albert), Tom Chase (Manukau), Jack Hemi (Manukau), Ross Jones (North Shore), Arthur Kay, Bert Leatherbarrow, Hawea Mataira (City), Arthur McInnarney (Mount Albert), George Mitchell (Richmond), Harold Milliken (Papakura), Laurie Mills (Richmond), Pita Ririnui (Manukau), Verdun Scott (North Shore), Jack Smith, Dave Solomon (Richmond), Ivor Stirling (North Shore), Wally Tittleton (Richmond). The Auckland Rugby League chairman, Mr. G. Grey Campbell was appointed co-manager for the tour, along with Mr. J.A. Redwood. On July 15 a complimentary dinner was held at Hotel Auckland in the evening to farewell the managers and Auckland players selected. The team was toasted by Mr. J.A. Lee, M.P., and replied to by Bob Banham and Hawea Mataira. Each of “the Auckland players was presented with a travelling case on behalf” of Auckland Rugby League. Campbell withdrew as co-manager on July 23 following several medical checks on his health. He “had recently had a severe attack of influenza, and the doctors were unanimously of the opinion that it would not be in the best interests of his health to undertake such a strenuous tour at the present time” He was replaced as co-manager by Mr. R. Doble who was the Auckland delegate to the New Zealand Rugby League Council.\nOn July 22 at Carlaw Park during the afternoon of regular club matches the Auckland players were farewelled by all the junior teams.\nThe schoolboys marched in their playing gear and “formed huge letters N.Z. in the background”. Members of the New Zealand team “assembled in front of the grandstand and a loud speaker system was used to carry the farewell messages of a dozen speakers”. The New Zealand Herald reported that “a feature of the occasion was the dedication in Māori of the New Zealand ensign and the ceremony was carried out by Mr. T.P. Kewene, on behalf of the Māori Control Board. The address was interpreted by Mr. P.K. Paikea, M.P. for the Northern Māori district, as an incantation of guidance and blessing to the team when abroad. Presentations were made to Verdun Scott, Arthur McInnarney and Laurie Mills by Mr. R. Newport on behalf of the Schoolboys’ Association for being the first ever products of the Auckland Rugby League school grades to “earn national honours with a team going overseas”. The ceremony concluded with Mr. J.A. Lee, M.P., president of the ARL leading singing of “For They Are Jolly Good Fellows”, and George Nepia and other Māori players singing “Till We Meet Again”.\nSenior first grade competitions.\nFox Memorial results.\nRound 2.\nManukau played against the touring Eastern Suburbs side at 3pm on the number 1 field with just 3 senior club matches played. In the Ponsonby v North Shore match the New Zealand Herald reported that Jack Campbell scored 2 tries however the Auckland Star said that he scored one and Simpson scored the other. The New Zealand Herald had a slightly more detailed description of the match and so Campbell has been attributed with both tries.\nRound 4.\nPapakura had their first win of the season beating a Marist side that was missing six of its regular players due to influenza.\nRound 5.\nIn the match between Newton and Papakura, Harold Milliken was sent off. The match was said to be marred by rough play and “the referee appeared to treat the incidents too lightly”. It was said that deliberate “spotting” of prominent players “should not be tolerated. In this respect H. Milliken, who was ordered off, must be considered unlucky, as he was badly obstructed on several occasions”. George Nepia scored a try for Manukau in their loss to Mt Albert. The match was full of current and future New Zealand team players such as Angus Gault, Des Herring, Arthur McInnarney, Bert Leatherbarrow, Tom Chase, Jack Brodrick, and Jack Hemi.\nRound 6.\nIn the match between North Shore and Newton at the Devonport Domain, Newton player Cyril Blacklaws was carried from the field with broken ribs. He missed several months and only returned to play late in the season. City had their bye and traveled to Huntly to play a match.\nRound 7.\nEx-New Zealand rugby union player Dave Solomon made his debut for Richmond and scored a try. Jack Campbell of the Ponsonby side was reported in the newspaper following this round to have been transferred to Christchurch for work reasons. He was selected for the New Zealand team later in the year. The Ponsonby v Marist match was reported as being 13–7 in both the New Zealand Herald and the Auckland Star however both newspapers only provided details for 10 of Ponsonby's points with a Ponsonby try scorer seemingly omitted.\nCatchup match.\nOn June 5 a match was played between Richmond and Marist. The match was from round 2 but was not played as Manukau were playing the Eastern Suburbs side at Carlaw Park that day and so only 3 club matches could be played. Hadley (Richmond), and Quirke (Newton) were ordered off and both suspended for one match.\nRound 10.\nFor Manukau's match against Ponsonby they were missing George Nepia, Jack Hemi, Peter Mahima, and Jack Brodrick, while Ponsonby was missing McManus (who had been injured the previous week in the first minute of the game), whilst Brian Riley went off injured early in the match. William Greer who had begun the season with City transferred to Papakura and played his first match with them against Mount Albert.\nRound 12.\nTaranaki played against Northland in a representative match at Carlaw Park as the curtain-raiser to the North Shore v Richmond match. While Manukau hosted Papakura at Waikaraka Park in Onehunga where Manukau were largely based at this time of their existence.\nRound 14.\nBob Banham who had already been selected for the New Zealand tour had to leave the field in his Mount Albert match with Manukau. He returned heavily bandaged and needed stitches afterwards. Hapeta was sent off in the North Shore game with Marist and was later suspended for one match.\nRound 15.\nAlf Broadhead of Richmond was sent off for “reckless tackling” and suspended for one week.\nRound 16.\nWith their 8–0 win over North Shore, Mount Albert sealed the championship. It gave them an unassailable 5 pt lead over the same side with only two rounds remaining.\nRound 18.\nDespite the fact that Mount Albert had secured the championship the league decided to play the final two rounds to find the runner up. In many seasons the competition would have concluded when the champion was found but a proper runner up was needed to play in the Stormont Shield final against Mount Albert in the event that they also won the Roope Rooster. North Shore beat Manukau to take second place with 21 points ahead of Newton on 19. The Richmond v Ponsonby match did not take place as the result could not have any bearing on second place.\nPhelan Shield.\nThe Phelan Shield was played for by teams who were defeated in the first round of the Roope Rooster knockout competition.\nStormont Shield (champion of champions).\nFinal.\nMalcolm Cato kicked a drop goal for Mount Albert after recently having switched from the rugby code. He went overseas to join the war effort in early 1941 and was killed in an aircraft accident on July 16, 1942, aged 25.\nSeven-a-side tournament.\nOn April 8 a seven-a-side tournament was held at Carlaw Park between the senior teams prior to the Eastern Suburbs XIII match against Marist.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\n \nSenior reserve competitions.\nNorton Cup results.\nIn round 1 Papakura defaulted to Manukau with it being reported during the week that the team had “suffered seriously from influenza”. Following round 16 Richmond were congratulated on securing the championship. Ponsonby appealed the result suffered in that same round claiming that Richmond had played an ineligible player owing to the fact that the match was a ‘final’. They said that he had played 5 matches for the senior side already so should not have been allowed to play. The league said that the game was not a final and so the player was in order.\nSenior B grade competitions.\nIn the Sharman Cup Otahuhu won with Ellerslie runner up. The first round featured a bye for Green Lane as Northcote was not able to field a team until round 2. Several results were not reported in any of the Auckland newspapers though Otahuhu winning the competition was reported.\nSharman Cup standings.\nThe standings are incomplete as all teams had match scores unreported (Ellerslie x 2), Green Lane (x1), R.V. (x2), Otahuhu (x2), Point Chevalier (x2), and Northcote (x3).\nSharman Cup results.\nIn their round 3 match the entire Green Lane side walked off the field in protest at the referee's decision. The referee was J. Gedye with the “incident occurring shortly before full time”. Point Chevalier were leading 10–6 at the time. Green Lane players stated later “that the play had been clean and that their action had been taken solely in protest to a decision by the referee”. in round 7 referee K. McIvor called off the match before it started because one of the teams only had 8 players after being “handicapped by influenza and injuries to players”. When dealing with the matter later the control board stated that a match should go ahead provided a team had 7 players and “desired to play”. Otahuhu were congratulated on winning the competition following round 10.\nWalmsley Shield (knockout competition).\nAs in previous seasons due to the short nature of the championship competition the Walmsley Shield knockout competition was played over one full round. The matches were played at neutral venues. In round 4 R.V. defaulted their match and withdrew from the competition owing to illness and injuries. The final was due to be played in late August but Otahuhu were entering the reserve grade knockout competition and so Ellerslie agreed to postpone the Walmesley Shield final until a later date which was ultimately September 9. Otahuhu won the final 5-3 which was played at Manukau. Northcote won the Foster Shield, presumably for finishing the 5 match round in first place (prior to the final).\nOther club matches and lower grades.\nLower grade clubs.\nOn October 4 the junior control board advised that Edmund Walter Garrod of the Marist club's third grade team had won the Dickson medal for the most improved player.\nGrades were made of the following teams with the winning team in bold:\nSchoolboys\nSchoolboy gala.\nA schoolboy gala was held at Carlaw Park On October 14. It featured the final of the fourth grade between Mount Albert and City which resulted in an 11-all draw, along with the crowning of the schoolboys’ queen which was Miss Dick. Other events were held such as running races, goal kicking competitions and a tug-o-war.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nSouth Auckland (Waikato) v Tāmaki (Auckland Māori).\nThere were no match reports with only the score stated as being a 19–8 win for the South Auckland team. It was also remarked that George Nēpia had played brilliantly in the game.\nTāmaki (Auckland Māori) v Auckland Pakeha.\nErnie Asher was the selector for the Auckland Māori side while R. Doble selected the Auckland Pakeha team. Richmond were playing Marist on the same afternoon and so no players from either team were chosen for the match. Jack Hemi kicked a penalty goal from a yard inside his own half.\nSouth Auckland (Waikato) v Tāmaki (Auckland Māori).\nThere were no match reports so it is unknown what the score was or who took the field exactly.\nInter Island match.\nWally Tittleton was chosen as the North Island captain while Rex King captained the South Island.\nNew Zealand Probables v New Zealand Possibles.\nJack Smith (Possibles) and Bob Banham (Probables) captained the sides.\nAuckland v South Auckland (Waikato).\nStan Prentice was named to coach the Auckland side. George Nepia was originally selected for Auckland but withdrew.\nTāmaki (Auckland Māori) v Bay of Plenty Māori (Waitangi Shield).\nThis match was originally scheduled to be played on August 17 but was postponed due to the state of Carlaw Park which had been badly affected by the wet weather.\nAuckland Pākehā v Tāmaki (Auckland Māori).\nThere were no players included in either side from Marist, City, or Richmond, with the later two teams playing in the Phelan Shield final which was the curtain-raiser.\nTāmaki (Auckland Māori) representative matches played and scoring.\nThe Māori side played in 5 matches in total. The first match was at Davies Park in Huntly and there was no match report. That match and several others had squads published but not match day teams so all squad players have been credited with playing regardless of whether they did or not. There was no scoring reported in two of the games so the scoring is incomplete.\nAnnual general meetings and club news.\nAuckland Rugby League Schools Committee.\nThey held their annual meeting in mid May.

The rent for the use of the park for the season was set at £10.\nIn early June the Papakura Post Office held a farewell function for Mr. P. Herkt who was transferring to Wellington. Herky had been a Papakura forward for years. On July 23 Papakura held a “special social function” with about 80 members and supporters in attendance to farewell Harold Milliken who had been chosen for the New Zealand team to tour England and France. Milliken was the Papakura club's first ever player to be selected to represent New Zealand. He was presented with “a substantial cheque… by the president, Mr. Les McVeagh, who wished him bon voyage and a successful tour. A combination travelling set was presented on behalf of the senior and senior reserve teams by Mr. J. Fogarty, captain of the senior side. Milliken “who replied, was accorded rousing musical honours. Items were given by Messrs Gregor Johnson, T.C. Seaton, Cyril Morris and Dobbyn”. In late July the club sent a letter of complaint regarding the state of Prince Edward Park which was “mud and slush”. The club secretary Mr. R.C. Williams wrote that the “club was deeply concerned about the conditions of the playing area. There was practically no grass in some parts and the mud near the shed where the sheep shelter was three or four inches thick. The Mayor said that the exceptionally bad weather was in a large measure responsible, but any damage by the sheep would be counteracted by the good they would do later on. It was decided to put a load or two of metal round the pavilion and pass on the matter to the reserves committee with power to act”.\nIn early September the Papakura Borough Council received a letter of complaint about the state of Prince Edward Park from the rugby league club particularly focussing on the playing area where the drain was not dealing with the flooding from recent rains. They also complained about several of the electric lights being broken and that the shed was in “an untidy condition” and often unlocked. On October 25 it was reported in the Franklin Times that the league club had taken over the scouts hall for training purposes. It would be fitted as a gymnasium and have “some useful equipment including overhanging rings, wrestling ring, vaulting horse, etc”. The club had received advice from the Athletic Centre in Auckland, and “a qualified instructor will be in attendance at the start of training which will begin very shortly. The training will be open for all members from boys to seniors”.\nPt.

        "title": "2021–22 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2021–22 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season was the 101st season of play for the program. They represented the University of Minnesota in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. This season marked the 32nd season in the Big Ten Conference. They were coached by Bob Motzko, in his fourth season, and played their home games at 3M Arena at Mariucci.\nSeason.\nMinnesota came into the season ranked 4th in both preseason polls. The lofty expectations were due mostly to the quality of returning players, which included starting goaltender and co-captain, Jack LaFontaine who was the reigning Mike Richter Award winner. In addition, Minnesota added five NHL-drafted players to their roster. Despite the prognostications, The Gophers got off to a less-than-stellar start. The team swept their opening weekend in spite of a sloppy defensive effort and followed that up- by playing .500 hockey for two months. The Minnesota offense showed up on most nights but, surprisingly, it was LaFontaine who appeared to be the team's biggest problem. The team's starter was inconsistent for the first half of the year, rarely posting consecutive games with solid results.\nBy the time Christmas rolled around, Minnesota was just 2 games above .500 and were in the middle of the Big Ten standings. The only saving grace for the team was their strength of schedule. Due to playing three top-10 non-conference teams, as well as three other ranked clubs within their conference, Minnesota was still on pace to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament.\nThe Gophers opened the second half of their season with a sweep over lowly Michigan State but then suffered a massive loss. On January 9 Jack LaFontaine, who had played all but 28 minutes in goal for the team to that point, signed a profession contract with the Carolina Hurricanes and ended his college career. Minnesota was forced to turn to junior Justen Close, who hadn't started a game in three years. The defense rallied around the Saskatchewan native and kept him insulated for several games as he got used to his new role on the team. Close managed to break even for the remainder of January even while playing two tournament-bound teams.\nOnce the calendar turned to February, Close began looking like a top-flight goalie and he backstopped the Gophers to their best performance all season. Though they had lost Brock Faber, Ben Meyers and Matthew Knies to the US Olympic team, Minnesota won their final eight regular season games and shot up both the standings and the rankings. In their final weekend before the playoffs, Minnesota shut out long time rival Wisconsin twice in the same weekend. The last time that had happened was in 1934, over 88 years earlier. The winning streak placed Minnesota atop the conference standings and gave the Gophers a bye into the Big Ten semifinals.\nPostseason.\nMinnesota remained at home and welcomed an upstart Penn State team to Mariucci. Despite having not played in two weeks, the Gophers got out to a 2-goal lead early in the second period. The Nittany Lions, however, stormed back to tie the game. Close held the fort in the third, giving co-Captain Sammy Walker the time he needed to score the winning goal. The team then faced Michigan for the title and while both teams were already guaranteed appearances in the NCAA tournament, they were fighting for more than just pride. Jaxon Nelson opened the scoring just 32 seconds into the game but that was the high point for the Gophers. The Wolverines scored four times over the next 30 minutes and took a commanding lead. As the clock ticked, Minnesota was unable to generate anything on the scoresheet until Michigan was handed a pair of penalties near the end of regulation. The Gophers scored on both powerplays, cutting the lead to just a single goal, but the second marker came with just 5 seconds left. Minnesota's comeback started just a bit too late and the Gophers were forced to watch Michigan celebrate a championship.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe loss caused Minnesota to drop just enough to receive a #2 seed in the tournament and were set against the defending national champion, Massachusetts. Early on it looked to be a bad match for the Gophers when UMass scored twice in the first but a late goal by Ryan Johnson got Minnesota back in the game before the period was over. After trading goals in the second, Knies knotted the score a 3-all in the third period and the two teams fought to a draw after 60 minutes. The Gophers traded chances with the Minutemen in overtime with the other co-Captain, Meyers, netting the winner on a pass from Aaron Huglen.\nIn the second round, Minnesota looked dominant against Western Michigan and shut down one of the strongest offenses in the nation. While the Gophers weren't particularly outstanding offensively, Close stopped all 24 shots that came his way and his third shutout of the season sent Minnesota to the frozen four.\nTheir semifinal opponent, Minnesota State, was the same team that had knocked Minnesota out of the tournament the year before. Unfortunately for the Gophers, they weren't able to produce a different result. After Knies opened the scoring, the Mavericks ran roughshod over the Maroon and Gold and scored the final 5 goals of the game. Though the finale was Minnesota's worst loss all season, the team was still one of the last four teams standing and could take pride in reaching the program's 22nd national semifinal.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2021–22 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey season was the 62nd season of play for the program. They represented the University of Notre Dame in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. This season marked the fifth season in the Big Ten Conference. They were coached by Jeff Jackson, in his 17th season, and played their home games at Compton Family Ice Arena.\nSeason.\nAfter a horribly disappointing situation that saw them have to withdraw from the 2021 NCAA tournament, Notre Dame entered the season with high expectations. They began the year alternating between junior Ryan Bischel and graduate transfer Matthew Galajda in goal with both performing wonderfully in goal. During the season both goaltenders were among the top 10 in the nation for goals against average and kept the Fighting Irish in contention for just about every game.\nDuring the first half of the year ND stayed in the second 10 of the polls until a showdown with Michigan just before Thanksgiving. The Irish managed to beat the top-ranked Wolverines twice on the road, firmly establishing themselves as a tournament hopeful. While they earned splits over each of the succeeding weekends to weaker teams, the losses didn't hurt their postseason chances too much.\nOn the offensive side, Notre Dame didn't have much in the way of a star scorer but the team worked well overall. The Fighting Irish averages over three goals a game and typically scored when they needed to, generating offense from all four lines. The balanced play enabled Notre Dame to put together an even better second half and, as the season progressed, the Irish slowly moved up into the top 10. In the final week of the regular season, they played Michigan once more, this time at home, and Notre Dame again swept the vaunted Wolverines, all but guaranteeing them a spot in the NCAA tournament.\nIn the Big Ten tournament, the Irish got a slight scare from Wisconsin when they lost the first game. Despite firing 50 shots on goal, the offense continued to attack in the next two games and the Badgers' defense couldn't repeat the same performance. When Notre Dame won the series they moved up to 6 in the PairWise rankings and were mathematically guaranteed a spot in the tournament. Despite that, the team was chomping at the bit to defeat Michigan for a 5th time that season as the two met in the conference semifinals. Unfortunately for the Irish, their offense would not get on track and they could only manage 20 shots in the game, losing 1–2.\nNCAA tournament.\nDespite the setback, Notre Dame looked ready to go once the NCAA tournament began. They took on North Dakota in what was expected to be a very even match (the two were ranked 9th and 7th respectively). Both teams played a very defensive style which kept both the shot total and scoring chances low. The Fighting Hawks got on the board at the end of the first but the Irish responded with their own just over a minute after the second began. Both defenses held strong for the balance of the game but a breakdown on a North Dakota power play as time was expiring gave Notre Dame a chance. The puck was fired into the top of the net right before the final buzzer and the Irish began to celebrate but, upon review, there was a problem with the clock. One of the game clocks still had time remaining but the official clock had already expired. After a lengthy review, the goal was ruled to have entered after time expired and the two teams required overtime. With North Dakota still on the power play, the Hawks made a mistake at the Irish blueline and took a penalty in order to stop a Notre Dame breakaway. Once the ND penalty expired, the Fighing Irish got to work and engineered an overtime winner from Graham Slaggert to send them to the quarterfinals.\nIn the Regional finals, Notre Dame faced off against #1 ranked Minnesota State but the Irish were undaunted. Notre Dame played the same hard defensive game that had worked for them all season but their offense, which was lacking high-end firepower, could not solve the equally strong resistance from the Mavericks. While Notre Dame was outshot, they had several opportunities to score but they could get nothing past Dryden McKay and the single goal that Galajda allowed was enough to end their season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

It was the eleventh iteration of the \"League of Legends\" World Championship, an annual international tournament organized by the game's developer, Riot Games. The tournament was held from 5 October to 6 November in Reykjavík, Iceland. Twenty two teams from 11 regions qualified for the tournament based on their placement in regional circuits such as those in China, Europe, North America, South Korea and Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macau/Southeast Asia with ten of those teams having to reach the main event via a play-in stage.\n\"Burn It All Down\" was the tournament's theme song, put together by PVRIS, while Denzel Curry, CIFIKA, Besomorph, and Wang Yibo from Uniq, produced their own respective remix versions of \"Burn It All Down\".\nEdward Gaming of China's LPL defeated the defending world champions, DWG KIA of Korea's LCK, to win their first World Championship title.\nImpact of coronavirus on the tournament.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which was mainly confined to China in January and early February 2020, once again affected the scheduled multi-city hosting format that was most recently present for the 2019 League of Legends World Championship. On June 16, Riot Games originally announced the dates and locations of the event, with the event taking place in Shanghai, Qingdao, Wuhan, Chengdu, and the finals taking place in Shenzhen. However, due to travel complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China, Riot Games announced Reykjavík, Iceland (where the 2021 Mid-Season Invitational had been hosted), as the new host city for the event.\nDue to complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam, two teams from the VCS (Vietnam) were once again unable to participate in the tournament.\nLike the 2020 event, the tournament did not feature a live audience as result of the pandemic.\nQualified teams.\nSouth Korea (LCK) and China (LPL) received an additional spot in the group stage, totaling up to four representatives each for their respective region. The qualification format for North America (LCS) changed to a one-season-per-year system, with the seeding decided by the cumulative scoreboard from the whole season and the results from their respective championship series. \nDue to Vietnam (VCS) being unable to field teams for the event, the third seed from Europe (LEC) received direct entry into the group stage. \nTop 4 regions in 2021 Mid-Season Invitational (LPL, LCK, LEC, PCS) are seeded to pool 1 in the main event's group stage for the summer champion.\nVenue.\nReykjavík was the city chosen to host the competition. All matches were played at Laugardalshöll without spectators. "

        "text": "The 2021–22 Penn State Nittany Lions men's ice hockey season was the 16th season of play for the program. They represented Penn State University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. This season marked the ninth season in the Big Ten Conference. They were coached by Guy Gadowsky, in his 11th season, and played their home games at Pegula Ice Arena.\nSeason.\nPenn State's season began with a bang and the Nittany Lions won six of their first seven games, culminating with a win over North Dakota at the Bridgestone Arena, the home of the Nashville Predators. The hot start got PSU its first ranking of the season but their circumstances quickly changed. As soon as they began their conference schedule, Penn State lost four game in a row with both their offense and defense crumbling. They recovered a bit at the end of November but the respite didn't last long and the Nittany Lions finished the first half of their season near the bottom of the Big Ten standings.\nAfter a win over Army to kick off their second half, Penn State lost four consecutive game again and were wallowing at the bottom of their conference. Oskar Autio hadn't been playing well in goal and the team began to move away from his as the primary starter. Liam Soulière began sharing the load in goal and the team got a boost at the end of January when they made their only conference weekend sweep of the year. The offense then failed afterwards and Penn State lost another 5 games in a row before managing a split with Big Ten bottom-feeder Michigan State to close out the regular season.\nThe team's terrible season was supposed to end quickly against Ohio State, who were gearing up for the NCAA tournament. Instead of surrendering to expectations, the Lions fought hard against the Buckeyes; after losing the first game by just a goal, the offense bombarded the OSU cage with 81 shots in two games. Soulière held back the counterattack just enough to earn two 1-goal wins and Penn State knocked out #12 team in the country. The Lions were nearly able to pull off a stunning comeback the following game when they tied Minnesota after being down 0–2, but a late goal from the Gophers ultimately ended their season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "These are the qualification rules and the quota allocation for the snowboarding events at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nQualification standard.\nA total of 238 athletes are scheduled to qualify to compete in the snowboarding events (119 men and 119 women). A country can enter a maximum of 26 athletes across all events, with a maximum of 14 per gender. A total of eight quotas (one per event) is reserved for the host nation, if it fails to qualify in that respective event. Each event also has a minimum FIS points total required per athlete, along with a top 30 finish at a World Cup event during the qualification period (1 July 2019 or 2020 in Parallel giant slalom, to 16 January 2022), or 2021 FIS Snowboarding World Championships. A total of 16 NOC's will qualify for the mixed team snowboard cross event. The athlete quota per event is listed below.\nAllocation of quotas.\nAt the end of the qualification period of 16 January 2022 quotas will be awarded using the Olympic Quota Allocation List (which includes all results of the World Cups from July 2019 and the results of the 2021 World Championship, except PGS which is only from July 2020). The spots will be awarded to each country per athlete appearing on the list starting at number one per event until a maximum for each event is reached, except for the snowboard cross events which will stop at 24 of 32. Once an NOC has reached the maximum of 4 quota spots in an event, it will no longer be counted for the allocation of quotas. If a nation goes over the total of 14 per sex or 26 total it is up to that nation to select its team to meet the rules by 18 January 2022. Any vacated spots will be then awarded in that event starting from the first athlete not to be awarded a quota. Slopestyle and Big Air are calculated as one event.\nAllocation for the mixed team snowboard cross event.\nAny nation that has qualified at least one competitor from each gender, may enter this event. If less than sixteen teams have the required number of athletes then NOCs that need either one more male or female competitor will be awarded a quota to enable participation in the team event. Once sixteen teams are formed, and if there is still less than 32 quotas filled in the male or female events, then the allocation process described above will continue. If there are not sixteen teams formed then NOCs who can form a second team will be ranked to fill remaining vacancies.\nAdditional participation for already qualified athletes.\nThe halfpipe will have quota limits of 25 athletes in both male and female events. However, athletes who have qualified in slopestyle or big air, and have met the qualification standard in halfpipe, may also compete bringing the event totals up to a maximum of 30 per gender. Similarly the slopestyle and big air events may include athletes who have qualified in halfpipe as long as each event total does not exceed 30 per gender.\nHost country places.\nIf the host China has not earned at least one quota place in each event they will be entitled to one quota within the prescribed maximums, provided the athlete has met the qualification standard.\nCurrent summary.\n\"As of 22 January 2022.\"\nNext eligible NOC per event.\nThe following list shows the next five (or less) eligible NOCs. A country can be eligible for more than one quota spot per event in the reallocation process."

They represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. This marked the 21st season in the Big Ten Conference. They were coached by Tony Granato, in his sixth season, playing their home games at Kohl Center.\nSeason.\nDespite losing its top 4 scorers from the previous season, Wisconsin entered the year ranked 13th in the nation. However, That soon proved to be a bit of wishful thinking and the Badgers were dropped from the polls by mid-October. The team faced a murderers-row of opponents, including three consecutive weeks against top-5 teams, and a lack of offensive firepower resulted in a last-place record come December.\nDespite the poor start, Wisconsin had an opportunity to turn their season around beginning with the Holiday Face–Off, the first in-season tournament held in Wisconsin since the Badger Showdown ended in 2010. The Badgers ended up winning the event, defeating Providence in a shootout, but weren't able to carry over any momentum from the championship.\nIn the second half of the season, Wisconsin won just three games. Their 6th-place finish came just a year after they won their first Big Ten championship. Wisconsin faced Notre Dame in the Big Ten quarterfinals and pulled off a stunning victory behind a 50-save effort from Jared Moe. Unfortunately, the Badgers couldn't get a repeat performance and lost the nest two games to the fighting Irish, ending a rather disappointing season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Players customize their own bowlers, selecting characters, naming them and selecting their clothes. Players interact with the game using four windows: the scorecard, a view to set the spin and power on the ball, a view for aiming the shot, and a display of the ball hitting the pins. Players are able to select their ball weight and choose lane conditions. Players may position their bowlers anywhere on the lane, using the aiming arrows to line up the throw.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was developed by Bethesda Softworks and MediaTech West.\nReception.\nGameSpot gave the game a 6.2 of 10 stating \"I'm sure there are people out there saying “Yeah, football and baseball are great, but when is a bowling game for the PC coming out?” Well, here it is. And, if you're a die-hard bowler, it's probably all you hoped for. For the rest of us, though, PBA Bowling leaves a little to be desired.\"\nPC Gamer gave the game a 70% of 100 stating \" PBA is one of a king simulation and great fun for fans of sport-but you may tire of the solo action before the beer frame\"\nPeter Scisco from CNET recommended the game stating \"There's no lounge, either. So even if the PBA Bowling is enough sports action for you, you still have an excuse to get out to the lanes. Either way you look at, it's best to download a demo first to see for yourself\" \nAccording to Pete Hines, Director of Marketing and Public Relations at Bethesda, the game is the best-selling bowling game of all time."

        "text": "Rock climbing in New Zealand, as a sport in its own right, emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s. While it has been practiced at least since the late 1800s it was largely considered as training for mountaineering. But by 1968 the first dedicated rock climbing guide had been published by the University of Canterbury tramping club, and the following decade saw a rapid improvement in standards and the introduction of new technologies and approaches including the bolting of routes that paved the way for sport climbing to emerge as an alternative to traditional route protection. Pursuit of trad climbing, sport climbing and bouldering all began developing their distinct trajectories separate from each other and from mountaineering.\nAccess.\nRock climbing in New Zealand is pursued in many settings: sea cliffs (e.g. Ti Point, Long Beach), lakeside cliffs (e.g. Kawakawa Bay and Whanganui Bay on Lake Taupō), riverside cliffs (e.g. Waipapa Dam), old quarries (e.g. Mt Eden Quarry), farmland crags (e.g. Wharepapa Rock, Waipari), and alpine crags (e.g. Wye Creek in The Remarkables). Access rights to these climbing areas vary across the country due to the circumstances of land ownership and governance. Sustainable access to rock climbing areas in New Zealand has become an increasingly important issue and in recent years a number of historically important climbing areas, such as Mt Eden Quarry and Whanganui Bay have become closed to the climbing community. In response to these difficulties the Aotearoa Climbing Access Trust was recently formed to engage with landowners and public land governance bodies to maintain sustainable access to rock climbing areas in New Zealand.\nMajor climbing areas.\nDetailed descriptions of climbing areas and climbing routes in New Zealand can be found on specialist websites including climbnz.org.nz, 8a.nu and thecrag.com.\nThe table below details those areas that have been most popular over the years, although some are closed.\nCompetition climbing.\nCompetition climbing in New Zealand is administered by Climbing New Zealand, a member of Sport New Zealand.\nHistory.\nAlthough rock climbing in New Zealand has a post-colonial history that can be traced back at least to the 1890s, it was primarily employed as training for mountaineering.\nIt was not until the 1970s that a community of dedicated rock climbers emerged focused primarily on rock climbing to push the sport into the modern era. The key protagonists advancing rock climbing standards in the 1970s included Robbie McBirney and Rick Mcgregor in Auckland and John Allen, John Howard and Dave Fearnley in Christchurch. Robbie McBirney and Rick Mcgregor contributed many first ascents in the Mt Eden Quarry, including Robbie McBirney's ascent of Supergroove in 1976. Although McBirney initially graded Supergroove at 24, it was soon recognised as the first 26 to be established in Oceania.\nAlthough rock climbing standards were greatly elevated in the 1970s, largely driven by members of the Auckland Rock Group, it was the 1980s the has been called the \"revolutionary epoch\" of New Zealand Climbing. It was the decade when bolting became ubiquitous, opening up many of the rock faces in New Zealand that had previously been unprotectable by traditional gear placements. In the North island the focus of activity was at Whanganui Bay with many climbers making significant contributions, including: Len Gillman, Graeme Aimer, Grant Davison, Bryce Martin, Simon Vallings, Robbie McBirney, Rick McGregor, Roland Foster and Micke Rockell.\nThe 1990s saw the proliferation of indoor climbing walls and the rapid development of Paynes Ford, arguably New Zealand finest sport climbing crag."

A Bay of Plenty team, consisting of players from Tauranga, Opotiki and Katikati, visited Auckland to play against four club teams over four days in December 1881.\nThe current Bay of Plenty Cricket Association, the first to cover the whole region, was formed in August 1931. \nIt was the 23rd association to become affiliated with the New Zealand Cricket Council, and thus became eligible to compete in the Hawke Cup.\nBay of Plenty were outclassed in their first challenges for the Hawke Cup, losing by wide margins to South Auckland in March 1932 and to Waikato (the renamed South Auckland team) in December 1938. Bay of Plenty hosted an international touring team for the first time in February 1936 when the Marylebone Cricket Club played them in a one-day match at Rotorua.\nThe Rigden Shield was inaugurated in 1944–45 for matches between Bay of Plenty and Poverty Bay. Bay of Plenty won and held the Shield for the first two years.\nNorthern Districts, of which Bay of Plenty is one of the constituent associations, began playing in the Plunket Shield in 1956–57. The first Bay of Plenty player to represent Northern Districts in the Plunket Shield was Des Ferrow, who played in three matches in 1956–57 and one in 1957–58. The second was Maurice Langdon, who began a 25-match career for Northern Districts in 1957–58.\nCricket in the Bay of Plenty developed as the population increased in the second half of the 20th century. Bay of Plenty won the Hawke Cup for the first time in 1985–86, captained by the Test player Andy Roberts, who scored 117 in the victory over Hawke's Bay. The next season, after relinquishing the title to Hawke's Bay, Bay of Plenty became the first team to lose and regain the Hawke Cup in the same season when they beat Hawke's Bay again. Since then, Bay of Plenty have won the title in 1996–97, 2012–13 and 2015–16. They hold the record for the highest team score in the Hawke Cup: 701, which they have reached twice – in 2013 and 2017.\nThe Bay of Plenty Cricket Association set up the Bay of Plenty Cricket Trust (now called the Bay Oval Trust) in 2009 to develop the team's home ground, Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui. While it remains Bay of Plenty's home ground, it is also one of Northern Districts' grounds, and is now also an international venue, staging its first Test match in November 2019.\nStructure.\nThree sub-associations make up the Bay of Plenty regional association: Rotorua Cricket Association, centred in Rotorua, Taupo Cricket Association, centred in Taupō, and Western Bay of Plenty Cricket Association, centred in Tauranga. Eastern Bay of Plenty, formerly with three clubs, currently consists of only one club, Whakatane."

However, it was largely dormant until the Arabian Gulf Rugby Football Union (AGRFU) was dissolved at the end of 2010. The AGRFU had organised local and regional rugby competitions before then across most countries in the Arabian Peninsula, including Qatar, but was split up to allow national federations to take charge in each country.\nThe Qatar Rugby Federation was fully affiliated to Asia Rugby in 2016, and became an associate member of World Rugby in 2020."

France 'B' won the match 17 - 15 and \"The Glasgow Herald\" noted:\nApart from the solid front row, only one Scot, Wright, did himself justice. It was he that kept Scotland in contention at the touchline, and his aggressive work elsewhere, notably in ruck drive and maul wrestling, should have served as a reminder to others.\nWhile with Edinburgh Wanderers, he made his full senior Scotland debut on 13 January 1973 against France in Paris. It was his only senior cap."

        "title": "Roy Powell (New Zealand rugby league)",
        "text": "Roy Powell was a rugby league player who represented New Zealand in four test matches in 1935 and 1936 against Australia (2), and England (2) at halfback. In the process he became the 230th player to represent New Zealand. He also played rugby league for the North Island and Auckland representative sides as well as spending 16 years playing for Richmond Rovers including 8 in the senior side.\nEarly life.\nRoy Powell was recorded as “Samuel Royden Henry Powell” on his birth records when he was born on 8 September 1908. His parents were Mabel Powell and Samuel Powell. His mother Mabel had previously been married to John Mulhern and they had 6 children together before John’s death. They were Horace John Mulhern (b.1891), Henry James Mulhern (b.1893), Ivy May Mulhern (1895), Irene Maude Mulhern (b.1896), Elsie Winifred Jane Mulhern (b.1898), and Reginald Frank Mulhern (b.1899). Henry died on 12 October 1893 aged just one month.\nAfter John’s death Mabel remarried Samuel Powell and at some point Mabel moved from the North Shore suburb of Northcote to Grey Lynn across the Waitematā Harbour. They had Roy in 1908 and a second son, Allan Frank Powell in 1909. Sadly Allan died on 19 April 1911 aged just 1 year and 5 months old. Further tragedy was to strike the family in 1916 when the eldest son, Horace John Mulhern was killed at the Somme on 2 July whilst fighting in World War 1. He was aged just 24 at the time and was buried at the Cite Bonjean Military Cemetery, Armentières in France. For several years after his death the family would have ‘In memoriam’ notices published including one on 4 July 1921 which read in part “Dear Jack, you are ever remembered and sadly missed. Inserted by his loving mother and step father, S. and M. Powell and little Roy, of Grey Lynn”.\nPlaying career.\nRichmond Rovers juniors.\nRoy Powell grey up in the Grey Lynn area and began playing for Richmond Rovers as a junior around 1924 aged 16 in the 6th grade. He was most likely playing in the midfield based on where he was being listed in the team line ups. Earlier in the year Roy had lost yet another brother, Reginald who died by suicide on the East Cape in July aged 24. He was working as a sawmill hand at the time though his name was erroneously reported at Reginald \"Malone\" at the time. He was buried Motu Cemetery on 22 July.\nRoy continued to play for Richmond juniors right through the remainder of the 1920s. In 1925 and 1926 he was still in the 6th grade A side before progressing to the 5th grade later in the season. In 1927 he had progressed to the 4th grade and then the 3rd grade intermediate section the following year. In 1929 aged 21 he started the year in the 3rd grade open side and the following season was promoted to the ranks of the 2nd grade. Then in 1931 he was part of the newly formed reserve grade competition once again in the Richmond jersey with the side coming 3rd. They did however win the Stallard Cup for the reserve grade knockout competition, defeating City Rovers reserves 13–5 in the final. Powell was briefly mentioned in a report of the match as having “given better full-back displays for the maroons”.\nRichmond seniors.\nAt the start of the 1932 season Powell would have been 26 years old and he still began the season most likely in the reserve grade side. But on 11 June he was mentioned in a match report for the senior side against Marist Old Boys. It is possible that he had debuted earlier but Richmond were not submitting their team sheets to the newspapers prior to this. It was said that “Powell put Richmond on the offensive with a well judged line kick…” though Richmond went down 21–13 in the match played at Carlaw Park. Against Devonport United the following week the Auckland Star said that he was “well in evidence” though Richmond again lost 13–5. Unfortunately the “good game” Powell was playing came to a premature end when he was forced to retire with an injury. The match was played in heavy rain and the main field at Carlaw Park was turning to mud before Powell collided with the fence. Powell was fit to play the following weekend however and turned out in their matches against City Rovers and Newton Rangers before spending a few weeks back in the reserve grade. His final match of the season was back in the top side though Richmond were knocked out of the Roope Rooster by City thus ending his and Richmond’s season.\nThe 1933 season saw Powell become fully established in the senior Richmond side. He played 19 matches and scored 5 tries. He spent the first half of the season playing in the loose forwards as a ‘rover’. His first try was in a round 5 match against Marist when he “dashed over for a good try” from a scrum. Against Newton the following weekend it was said he “played a fine game for Richmond. Not much over 9st., Powell was in the thick of the play all afternoon”. The following week in a resounding 32–12 win over Ponsonby United the Auckland Star reported that “with Telford, J Hawkes, [Tony] Milicich, Satherley, and Powell, Richmond has forwards of calibre, Powell revealing cleverness as a breakaway”. Despite his good play in the forwards however he began playing in the halfback position mid season and was there when Richmond won the Roope Rooster final against City on 19 August. They won 26–16 at Carlaw Park. Against Devonport in their 12–7 Stormont Shield loss Powell was singled out in \"The New Zealand Herald\" which said “Powell was easily the best Richmond back. His play at halfback was brilliant at times”. On 27 October Richmond were given the opportunity to test themselves against Australian opposition with St. George (New South Wales runners up), touring the upper North Island. Richmond won 13 points to 8 at Carlaw Park with “Prentice, Powell and Mitchell… the outstanding backs for Richmond”. Powell was again on the victorious Richmond side when they defeated St. George again on 14 October by 5 points to 3.\nAuckland and North Island selection.\nThe 1934 season began on an interesting note for Powell. Shortly before the season he lost the “joint of a finger” in a “motor accident”. The year for Richmond was to be somewhat of an historic one. They were only defeated twice in the season, both in the championship on their way to their first ever Fox Memorial title. They also won the Roope Rooster knockout competition and Stormont Shield awarded to the champion of champions, becoming the first ever club to do this. Then at the end of the season they defeated the Western Suburbs side who were New South Wales Rugby League champions. Powell played a prominent part throughout and earned a place in the Auckland and North Island sides. In Richmond’s first game of the season he was said to have done “a lot of useful work behind the scrum” in an 18–7 win over Newton Rangers. After a win over Devonport \"The New Zealand Herald\" said that “an outstanding game was played by Powell, the Richmond halfback. His all-round play meant a great deal to Richmond and he was responsible for the team’s only try through a clever movement from the scrum. Powell has been playing very sound football all the season and must come into consideration for the representative honours”. In a 20–8 win over Marist he “played another fine game at halfback, being directly responsible for the try scored by [Ralph] Jenkinson through clever play from the scrum”. It was also said that “besides improving on attack, Powell does a lot of defensive work, which repeatedly gets his side out of trouble. On present form there should be no doubt about his inclusion as representative half”.\nOn 20 June he was selected as part of the Auckland training squad to practice towards the match with Taranaki. Then on 25 June the selectors Bert Avery, W. Mincham, and Ernie Asher chose him to play in the match with Richmond team mates Bert Cooke and Stan Prentice outside him in the five-eighths positions.\nThe match was played on 30 June at Carlaw Park with Auckland winning 35–8. The Auckland Star said that “he lived up to his reputation at half-back”. Then after 2 more club matches Powell was nominated by Auckland Rugby League for the North Island team to play the South Island. He went with Richmond on their tour to Taranaki and Hawke's Bay where they played the local representative sides on 9 and 11 August respectively. They lost to Taranaki 23–22 before beating Hawke's Bay 37–11. Upon his return to Auckland he played Devonport and the Herald said that “another fine game was played by Powell, who has improved considerably during the season and is developing into a fine all-round player”. A fortnight later after a Roope Rooster semi final win over Ponsonby United, Powell was picked in the North Island side to play the South Island. Alongside him again would be Cooke and Prentice. The match was played on 1 September at Carlaw Park and before a crowd of 9,000 the North Island side won 36–18. It was said that “Powell was great behind the Northern pack, and right from the opening of the game he made repeated gaps in the opposing lines, and on occasion ran a trifle too far before parting with the ball”.\nOn 9 September Richmond defeated Marist 20–13 to win the Roope Rooster for the fourth time with Powell playing well. He was then named in the Auckland team to play South Auckland (Waikato). Thomas McClymont was coaching the side and they won 35–16 at Carlaw Park on 15 September with Powell in “good form”.\nPowell then finished the season with 3 big matches for Richmond. They played the 1934 New South Wales champions Western Suburbs twice recording 18–16 and 10–3 wins before crowds of 15,000 and 13,000 respectively. Powell scored a try in the first win when the scores were level 13–13 after he “dashed away from the scrum, and, catching his opponents on the wrong foot, crossed the line and darted around near the goal-posts”. The Herald reported said that he was “the most improved player in the code in Auckland. He has shown great promise for the past two seasons and was always very solid on defence. He is now very clever on attack and scored a fine try against Western Suburbs… on present form he bids fair to rival the best halfbacks of the past”. Powell then capped his season as part of the Richmond, 21–5 Stormont Shield win over Newton.\nNew Zealand debut v Australia.\nPowell played 18 games for Richmond in 1935, scoring 4 tries. Reports of him early in the season were critical saying that he was holding on to the ball too long and being caught with it. After round 4 against Ponsonby it was reported that he “showed improvement, but his play was not up to that of last season”. By round 10 following a match against Marist it was said that \"Powell was in top-hole form behind the scrum, deftly getting the ball away to Stan Prentice\". He was then chosen for the Auckland side to play Taranaki. He scored a try in a 37–14 win at Carlaw Park though he reportedly “did not show his best form”. Despite this he was picked for the North Island to play the South Island. Then days later on 10 August he scored a “very fine solo try from a scrum ten yards out [after he] caught the Mount Albert backs hopelessly out of position” in the Fox Memorial championship final. Richmond won the match 14 to 9.\nIn the match for the North Island he scored a try in their 19–18 win though he was said to have “played better games”. His try came after he “chimed in twice to a North Island passing rush and finally scored wide out”. Powell was then chosen to train as part of a group of Auckland players who were not going on their southern tour to play Canterbury and Wellington. On 14 September he played in Richmond’s 26–15 Stormont Shield win over Newton. Richmond had qualified for the game by winning the Fox Memorial championship for the second straight time. Powell was picked in the Auckland side at half back to play the touring Australia team after Wilf Hassan was troubled by a knee injury during Auckland's matches in the south. On 21 September Auckland went down 16–8 before a crowd of 15,000 at Carlaw Park. Auckland had put up a good showing against a strong side and Powell “did his duty satisfactorily” behind a “sextet that was beaten for the ball”.\nImmediately after the match for Auckland, the New Zealand team to play the first test against Australia was chosen. Powell was selected at half back with Stan Prentice and Arthur Kay outside him in the five eighths positions. The match was played at Carlaw Park and saw New Zealand with an upset victory by 22 points to 14. Powell was playing opposite Australian halfback Viv Thicknesse and “defended well but had few chances on attack”. He was chosen to play half back again for the second test which was also at Carlaw Park. New Zealand were heavily beaten by 29 points to 8. Powell was a casualty of the loss with seven personnel changes in total, and was replaced at half back by Richmond team mate Eric Fletcher for the third test which New Zealand lost comprehensively again 31 to 8.\nNew Zealand v England.\nThe 1936 season saw Powell make 19 appearances for Richmond. After 6 rounds of the Fox Memorial the Herald reported Powell was the best half back in Auckland along with Frank Halloran of Ponsonby, however [Powell] has proved sturdy on defence, and this may be the deciding factor in his favour when the final Auckland team is chosen”. On 23 June he played for Auckland against the Auckland Māori (Tāmaki) side. The Māori team won 30–21. On 11 July he played in an Auckland trial which was the curtain-raiser to the annual North Island v South Island match. His ‘A Team’ went down 16–13 to the ‘B Team’. Two weeks later Powell was chosen to play for Auckland against the touring England side. The match was played on 15 July before 14,000 spectators and Auckland fought well before going down 22–16 to a strong opponent. Powell was said to have been “starved” of the ball with Auckland losing the scrums (18–40) “but shaped well in a defensive role”.\nHis performance was enough to convince the selectors (Bert Avery, Thomas McClymont, and Jim Amos) to choose him to play in the first test at Carlaw Park. It was said his selection was justified as he was “the soundest all-round half-back”. New Zealand went down narrowly by 10 points to 8 before a huge crowd of 25,000 with Powell playing opposite Billy Watkins. He was involved in an early attack but “was smothered when a try looked possible” after Frank Pickrang had broken away. He was then involved in a passing movement with Wally Tittleton and Lou Brown who was pushed into touch a few feet from the try line. Later in the match with the score 10–6 in favour of England Arthur Kay broke away to the halfway line and passed to Powell who was again “smothered” by Alec Troup. Then at the conclusion of the game, probably not knowing exactly how much time was left “from a set scrum right in front of England’s goal Powell passed to Trevarthan, who kicked a neat field goal. The game ended immediately” with England holding on for a two point victory.\nPowell was then chosen for the second test which was played at the same venue a week later with it said “Powell is safe and sound in all departments at half-back, and he will open up the play if the ball is heeled to him”. Once again the backs received few chances with the Auckland Star reporter saying that “the New Zealand wings had a starvation day as far as scoring chances went, and Mincham scarcely saw the ball, except in the distance”. They went on to say that “Powell played resolutely at half-back, and gave his best” however New Zealand went down 23 to 11 with 17,000 watching on. At one point with New Zealand trailling 10–2 he \"beat the defence, but [fullback] Belshaw saved with a fine tackle\".\nPowell then returned to club football and played 6 matches for Richmond before the season end. They were neck and neck with Manukau in the Fox Memorial championship before a loss to North Shore Albions in the penultimate round saw Manukau leap frog them into first place and they stayed there after a final round win. Richmond did however have the ‘last laugh’ when they beat Manukau to win the Stormont Shield on 3 October by 30 points to 9 to finish the club season in Auckland.\nRichmond and Auckland.\nIn 1937 Powell played 19 matches for Richmond, scoring 3 tries. After 2 preseason games and 2 Fox Memorial games Powell was selected to play for Auckland against Auckland Māori (Tāmaki). The match was played midweek at Carlaw Park on 12 May and saw Auckland win 24–14. On 9 June in another midweek representative fixture Powell again turned out for Auckland in their match against Taranaki. Auckland won by 27 points to 10 with Powell playing “a sound game, but [he] lacked variety”. With the Australian team due to tour later in the season Powell was chosen in a New Zealand trial match amongst the reserves, however on match day on 28 July he was not among the reserves with just William McCallum and Hawea Mataira listed. On 31 July Powell played in an 11–11 draw with a Manukau side who were the reigning champions. The New Zealand Herald said after the match that “Powell played easily his best game this season, and is a little unlucky to lose his place as the New Zealand halfback”. On 28 August Richmond sealed another championship when they beat Newton Rangers 30–9 in the final round to claim their third title, with Powell having been at halfback through them all. Five weeks later Powell’s season finished with a 12–5 loss to Marist Old Boys in the Stormont Shield final with Powell scoring Richmond’s only try after he “dived through the ruck to score”. He was the “pick of the backs” along with Noel Bickerton and Ted Mincham.\nFinal season for Richmond and retirement.\nThe 1938 season was to be Powell’s last season of rugby league. He played 17 games and scored 3 tries as Richmond could only manage 5th in the Fox Memorial competition. They did however lift the Stormont Shield though Powell was not part of the side as he had stopped playing following their 6 August match against Marist in the penultimate round of the Fox Memorial. Perhaps fittingly he played halfback in the match after spending much of the season in other positions. He had been moved to fullback from round 2 until round 5 after A. Watkins had taken up the halfback position. The Herald said after round 4 that Richmond was “having difficulty with the fullback position. Powell, halfback last season, was tried, but he did not fill the role with the same success as that he enjoyed behind the scrum”. Following their round 5 game with Marist he was said to have “played a sound game at fullback and placed his kicks with good judgment”. Then the following week Powell was moved to standoff for their match with Manukau where he remained for 7 matches before shifting to fullback for a match before his final game at halfback.\nPowell had obviously retired late in the 1938 season missing their final 6 games however he made one more appearance for Richmond in round 3 in 1939. Several teams had been hit hard by influenza and so he turned out at halfback with Watkins are standoff. The Auckland Star said that Powell “behind the scrum, distinguished himself by playing the best game amongst the Richmond backs”.\nIn August 1941 Powell was chosen in a “Patriotic Contest” in a match between the “All Golds” and South Auckland. The sides were composed of past New Zealand and South Auckland representative players with Powell at halfback. Later in the same year he was chosen in a team “to represent the New Zealand Rugby League Old Boys’ Association” in a match with South Auckland.\nPersonal life and death.\nRoy Powell married Joyce Caroline Bryant on 27 July 1935. Roy was working as a cabinet maker at the time of his marriage when he was living at 2 Sussex Street in Grey Lynn with his parents. His father Samuel has his occupation listed as a seaman. The married couple lived at 18 Warwick Avenue in Westmere, a neighbouring suburb to Grey Lynn with that being Joyce Powell's listed address on the 1935 electoral roll.\nRoy and Joyce had a daughter in 1936 who later married Barrington John Lereculey. Joyce died on 27 September 1960.\nRoy died on 2 April 1980 aged 71. He had been working as a machinist prior to his retirement and was living at 32 Hoteo Avenue in Papatoetoe, Auckland. He was cremated at Purewa Cemetery with his ashes returned and then buried on the “Protestant Lawn” at Waikumete Cemetery."

        "text": "The 2022 Indianapolis 500 (branded as the 106th Running of the Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge for sponsorship reasons) was a 500-mile (804.7 km, 200 lap) race in the 2022 IndyCar Series, held on Sunday, May 29, 2022, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. The month of May activities formally began on May 14 with the GMR Grand Prix on the combined road course. Practice on the oval opened on May 17, and time trials took place on May 21–22. Carb Day, the traditional final day of practice, along with the Pit Stop Challenge, took place on May 27.\nSix-time IndyCar champion, and 2008 Indianapolis 500 winner Scott Dixon won the pole position, his fifth career Indy 500 pole. It was also Chip Ganassi Racing's seventh Indy pole. Dixon's qualifying speed of was the fastest Indy 500 pole speed of all time, and the second-fastest Indy 500 qualifying attempt in history. Dixon moved into second on the all-time list for poles at Indy, behind only Rick Mears, who had six. The top twelve starting positions saw a near even split with seven Hondas and five Chevrolets. During the race, Dixon became the all-time lap leader in the history of the Indy 500.\nDixon led the most laps (95), and dominated much of the race along with teammate Álex Palou. With 25 laps to go, however, during his final pit stop, Dixon was penalized for speeding entering the pit lane. Dixon was issued a drive-through penalty, which took him out of contention and handed the lead to his teammate, Marcus Ericsson. Ericsson held off a furious charge from Pato O'Ward on a restart with two laps to go to win the race. Ericsson became the second Swedish winner in the race's history, after Kenny Bräck in 1999.\nRace background.\nSponsorship.\nOn January 31, 2019, it was announced that the online financial services company Gainbridge would become the new presenting sponsor of the 500 under a four-year deal. This will be the fourth year under the current deal.\nQualifying changes.\nThe Two-day format that began in 2019 has been expanded, based on the popularity of the three-round system used for most of the IndyCar road and street courses events. The system will continue to use the two day system (Saturday May 21 &amp; Sunday May 22), and cars will continue to utilize the traditional four-lap qualifying attempts. The top twelve cars from the first day will advance to a new second round that will take place on the second day. The top six cars in the second round advance to the final round to determine the pole position as well as starting positions two through six. If more than 33 entries take part in the event, the Last Chance Qualifying session will be used once again to set starting positions 31–32–33.\nOn Saturday, the procedure will be as follows:\nOn Sunday, time trials will conclude as follows:\n2022 IndyCar Series.\nThe 2022 Indianapolis 500 was the sixth race of the 2022 NTT IndyCar Series season. Four different drivers won the first five races of the season, including one first-time winner. Scott McLaughlin won the season opener at St. Petersburg, his first career IndyCar win. At Texas, Josef Newgarden won, passing McLaughlin coming off the last turn of the last lap. Newgarden followed up with another win at Long Beach and Pato O'Ward won at Alabama in a time-shortened race (two hours) due to rain. The GMR Grand Prix was won by Colton Herta. Despite zero wins thus far on the season, Will Power entered the 500 as the series points leader.\nRace schedules.\nThe 2022 IndyCar Series schedule was announced on September 19, 2021. The Indianapolis 500 was for Sunday, May 29. Practice, time trials, and other ancillary events are scheduled for the two weeks leading up to the race. The GMR Grand Prix, including the Road to Indy races, will again serve as the opening weekend of track activity, on May 14. The Freedom 100 for the Indy Lights was left off the schedule for the third year in a row, with Roger Penske citing safety as an issue. The 2022 Indy Lights season will only include a race on the road course during GMR Grand Prix weekend.\nEntry list.\nAll entries utilized the Dallara DW12 chassis with the Universal Aero Kit 18, with Firestone tires.\nA total of 32 car/driver combinations were made official in time for the Open test on April 20. Paretta Autosport (in technical alliance with Ed Carpenter Racing) announced on April 19 that they would not enter, electing instead to focus on road/street course races during the summer months. The 33rd and final entry was announced on May 5, with DragonSpeed and Cusick Motorsports joining to field a car. The official entry list was published on May 16, 2022.\nTesting and Rookie Orientation.\nOctober 2021.\nA private offseason Firestone tire test was scheduled for October 8. Hélio Castroneves (Meyer Shank Racing) and Pato O'Ward (Arrow McLaren SP) were scheduled to participate. Jimmie Johnson (Ganassi) and Romain Grosjean (Andretti) were scheduled to complete the Rookie Orientation Program during a separate session on October 6.\nRookie Orientation consists of three phases. Phase 1 was ten laps between , Phase 2 was fifteen laps between , and Phase 3 was fifteen laps over . Lingering rain hampered track activity, but the track was dried and Johnson and Grosjean both completed Phase 1 and Phase 2. Both drivers completed about half of Phase 3 before a downpour closed the track for the day at 4:15 p.m.. Series officials announced that both drivers had completed a satisfactory amount of laps, and would be eligible to participate in the full-field Open Test scheduled for April.\nOn Friday October 8, Castroneves and O'Ward conducted baseline testing, as well as preliminary KERS testing. No incidents were reported, and no speeds were announced.\nPractice.\nOpening Day — Tuesday May 17.\nRookie and refresher tests.\nAt 12:00 p.m., the track was opened for three hours for rookie and refresher testing. As nearly all drivers had participated in the April test session, Stefan Wilson was the lone participant in the session. Wilson passed his refresher test without incident. He turned a top lap of .\nCombined session.\nAll 33 drivers took to the track during the session, turning a combined 3,229 laps. Takuma Sato set the fastest lap late in the day, running at . Rinus VeeKay was fastest in the no-tow rankings, running a lap at with no aid from aerodynamic drafting. No major incidents were reported, but the session was briefly disrupted by a fox entering the race course. Honda-powered machines took eight of the top ten spots for the session.\nTime Trials.\nQualifying — Saturday, May 21.\nIn anticipation of forecast afternoon rain storms, IndyCar officials moved the start of qualifications up one hour to 11:00 a.m. During morning practice, Ed Carpenter set the pace with a blistering lap of , the fastest lap thus far of the month. Several minor incidents dotted the day. Juan Pablo Montoya's car failed pre-qualifying inspection, causing him to lose his guaranteed attempt and was only permitted to run after all others completed their guaranteed attempt. Stefan Wilson also saw pre-qualifying drama, as the engine in his car failed during the morning practice session. Wilson did not make a qualifying attempt, relegating him to starting 33rd for the race.\nDuring qualification runs, Takuma Sato had his first attempt disallowed after he neglected to use the turn three warmup lane on his cool down lap, resulting in him interfering with Marco Andretti's run. Andretti had further issues on his run with engine problems causing him to lose significant time on his third lap. Sato and Andretti would later requalify and improve their times. Sato advanced to the Fast 12 session on Sunday, despite brushing the wall in turn two on his third lap. Andretti's teammate Colton Herta suffered an engine failure on his first attempt and was forced to change engines before making a second run later in the day.\nRain began to fall on the track just before 2:30 p.m. After roughly one hour, the track was dried and two more runs were completed, but more rain began to fall just before 4:00 p.m., with IndyCar calling an end to Saturday qualifications at roughly 4:50 p.m. Rinus VeeKay was the fastest driver of the day, qualifying with a four-lap average of . VeeKay's attempt was the third fastest qualifying run in Indianapolis 500 history.\nQualifying — Sunday May 22.\nTop 12 qualifying.\nThe Top 12 session commenced at 4:00 p.m., with each driver permitted one attempt. Drivers took to the track in reverse order of the results from Saturday qualifying. Scott Dixon was the fastest in the Top 12 round, completing a 4-lap average at . Rinus VeeKay, Álex Palou, Marcus Ericsson, Ed Carpenter, and Tony Kanaan also advanced to the Fast Six round. There were no incidents, though Jimmie Johnson nearly lost control of his car on his run, resulting in him being last of the top 12. After the conclusion of the session, those that qualified for the Fast Six shootout were given a five-minute period behind the pace car to cool their engines down for the next run.\nPost-Qualifying practice.\nPit Stop Challenge.\nThe Pit Stop Challenge returned to the Carb Day schedule for the first time since 2019. The event was scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m., after Carb Day practice had concluded, but was delayed to 3:30 due to early weather holds. 14 teams were invited to participate. Colton Herta's team was entered, but withdrew after Herta's crash during the earlier practice session. Team Penske won the pit stop challenge with Josef Newgarden's car, winning the best-of-three final against Chip Ganassi Racing with Scott Dixon's car. It was Penske's 18th win in the competition and the third for chief mechanic Travis Law. One incident occurred during the challenge when Sage Karam spun and nearly collided with Felix Rosenqvist in the first round when his Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing team failed to secure a tire on his car.\nRace report.\nFirst half.\nAt the start, Álex Palou took the early lead of the race, with Rinus VeeKay and Scott Dixon behind. Dixon eventually passed VeeKay for second, allowing him and his teammate Palou to exchange positions regularly to drive to conserve fuel. These three remained at the front through to the first pit stops, which came around lap 31. After pit stops, VeeKay emerged ahead of Dixon for second. On lap 39, VeeKay caused the race's first caution period after losing control of his car in turn two and impacting the outside wall. VeeKay was uninjured, but was relegated to finishing 33rd and last. After the accident, Chip Ganassi Racing cars ran 1–2–3, with Palou leading Dixon and Marcus Ericsson.\nRacing resumed on lap 47, with Palou and Dixon resuming their attempt at fuel conservation. This continued to the second round of pit stops, which began at roughly lap 67. Just as the first stops began happening, Callum Ilott lost control of his car in turn two and impacted the outside wall before skidding back across the track and making light contact with the inside wall on the backstraight. Ilott suffered broken bones in his right hand, but was able to climb from the car unassisted. The injuries would force Ilott to miss the next race of the IndyCar season. The incident brought out the race's second caution period. Race leader Álex Palou was worst effected by the timing of the caution. Palou entered pit lane just after it closed for the caution, forcing him to drive through without taking service. Two laps later, with the pits still closed, Palou was forced to take emergency service to prevent running out of fuel, with the penalty being starting at the end of the field for the restart. The sequence took Palou out of contention for the win for the remainder of the race. Everyone else who had not pitted before the caution came in once the pits opened. Scott Dixon assumed the lead of the race, having stopped just before Ilott's crash, while Conor Daly vaulted up the order to second.\nRacing resumed at lap 78, with Dixon maintaining his lead over Daly. At lap 80, Daly overtook Dixon for the lead, but only led for a few laps before Dixon returned to the front. The running order remained largely the same to halfway. At the halfway mark, Scott Dixon held the lead over Daly, Pato O'Ward, Marcus Ericsson, and Tony Kanaan.\nSecond half.\nThe third caution period of the race came out on lap 106, when Romain Grosjean lost control of his car in turn two and impacted the outside wall. Grosjean was uninjured in the accident. During the caution, the majority of the field pitted again, with Scott Dixon being first out of the pits. Dixon would line up second for the restart behind Conor Daly, who had pitted just before the caution.\nRacing got under way once again on lap 112. On the restart, Pato O'Ward passed both Daly and Dixon to take the lead of the race, while Santino Ferrucci moved into the top-five positions after passing several cars. Dixon quickly took the lead from O'Ward, with O'Ward settling in behind in a bid to conserve fuel. Daly ran third, Ferrucci fourth, and Felix Rosenqvist fifth. At lap 141, the penultimate round of pit stops began. O'Ward emerged from the pits with the lead over Dixon, while O'Ward's teammate Rosenqvist moved to third.\nThe fourth caution period of the day came at lap 151, when Scott McLaughlin lost control of his car in turn three. McLaughlin impacted the outside wall, then continued to slide into turn four before impacting the wall again and nearly collecting Ed Carpenter in the incident. McLaughlin emerged uninjured in the wreck and later indicated that he had been caught out by the wind, which had increased since the start of the race.\nRacing resumed at lap 158, with Dixon immediately passing O'Ward to take over the lead again, with Felix Rosenqvist third, Conor Daly fourth, and Marcus Ericsson fifth. This order remained the same until the final round of pit stops, which began at roughly lap 173. Dixon pitted from the lead on lap 175, but locked the rear tires entering the lane, causing him to be over the pit lane speed limit at the pit entry line. Dixon received a drive-through penalty for the mistake, removing him from contention to win despite leading nearly half of the race. With Dixon removed from the lead battle, the front pack now consisted of O'Ward, Felix Rosenqvist, and Dixon's teammate Marcus Ericsson, who had gained substantially on the Arrow McLaren SP cars during the pit sequence. Ericsson moved around O'Ward and Rosenqvist and began to pull away while dealing with slower lapped traffic. Marco Andretti and Jimmie Johnson briefly lead ahead of this group, but were on an alternate pit strategy and both pitted by lap 190, handing the lead to Ericsson.\nFinish.\nThe fifth caution period of the day came at lap 194, when Jimmie Johnson lost control of his car in turn two after entering too low, causing him to impact the outside wall. Johnson was uninjured in the accident. In an effort to ensure the race did not finish under a caution period, IndyCar officials stopped the race to clean up the wreckage, setting up a two-lap shootout to the end. At the red flag, Ericsson led O'Ward, Tony Kanaan, Rosenqvist, and Alexander Rossi.\nRacing resumed on lap 199, with Rosenqvist diving to the inside of Kanaan on the restart, allowing Ericsson and O'Ward to gap the duo down the backstretch. Ericsson started weaving across the track in an effort to break the draft that O'Ward would get. On the final lap, O'Ward drew even with Ericsson entering turn one, but was unable to execute a pass. As the leaders reached turn three for the final time, the sixth and final caution period came as Sage Karam impacted the wall in turn two and skidded to a halt on the backstraight grass. Karam was sent to a local hospital after complaining of musculoskeletal soreness, but was released shortly thereafter with no injuries. The caution period effectively ended the race, with Marcus Ericsson taking his first Indianapolis 500 victory.\nEricsson's victory was the second for a driver from Sweden, after Kenny Bräck's win in 1999. It was the fifth Indianapolis 500 victory for the Chip Ganassi Racing team, but its first since 2012. For winning, Ericsson earned $3.1 million from a record purse of $16,000,200. Despite his late race accident, Jimmie Johnson was elected Rookie of the Year. The decision to award Johnson Rookie of the Year honors was divisive, with several motor racing journalists as well as some competitors suggesting that David Malukas – the highest finishing rookie in 16th – was more deserving of the award.\nDuring the course of the race, Scott Dixon set a new record for Most career laps led in the Indianapolis 500. By leading 95 laps during the race, Dixon reached 665 total career laps led, surpassing the previous mark set by Al Unser of 644 laps led.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\n Points include qualification points from time trials, 1 point for leading a lap, and 2 points for most laps led.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe race was televised on NBC and Peacock Premium in the United States. The terrestrial television broadcast was subject to blackout in Central Indiana. The streaming broadcast on Peacock was not subject to blackout, as the platform does not currently have the ability to enforce such restrictions at a local level. NBC received special consent from IMS to stream the race within the blackout region for 2022 only, under the presumption that the required capabilities would be implemented prior to the 2023 race. This was only the sixth time in race history that the race was available to be seen live in the Central Indiana market.\nFormer driver James Hinchcliffe joined the NBC broadcast team for 2022 as a color commentator, replacing Paul Tracy, who had been in the role for the previous three years for the race.\nOn May 4, NBC announced their full crew for the race broadcast. Mike Tirico and Danica Patrick returned as the hosts for pre-race and post-race coverage, while Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Rutledge Wood returned for pre-race coverage. Tirico, Patrick, and Earnhardt were also announced as part of the \"Peacock Pit Box\" crew for mid-race coverage. Dillon Welch joined the crew as a pit reporter, replacing Kelli Stavast, who had been part of NBC's coverage since 2019.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried by the IndyCar Radio Network. The chief announcer or \"Voice of the 500\" for the seventh consecutive year was Mark Jaynes with Davey Hamilton as driver analyst."

        "text": "The 2021–22 UConn Huskies women's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut (UConn) during the 2021–22 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The Huskies, led by Hall of Fame head coach Geno Auriemma in his 37th season at UConn, split their home games between Harry A. Gampel Pavilion and the XL Center and were members of the Big East Conference, which they joined for women's basketball the previous season. UConn was a member of the original Big East Conference from 1979 through 2013, and one of the original women's basketball teams in that conference in 1982.\nReturning from a 28–2 season with no graduations, the team went into the season highly regarded, starting the season ranked 2nd in the AP poll. The Huskies returned three seniors and sophomore consensus 2020–21 NCAA player of the year Paige Bueckers, while adding a 2nd ranked recruiting class. Several athletes transferred during the offseason and early season, leaving the team with 12 players. The no. 2 Huskies lost a November game against no. 1 South Carolina. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic caused game postponements and cancellations. Injuries plagued the team; only two athletes played every game. In December, Bueckers suffered a knee fracture which kept her sidelined until late in the season.\nWith Bueckers out, UConn's offense struggled against several teams, with losses against unranked Georgia Tech and no. 6 Louisville before semester break, no. 9 Oregon in January, and unranked Big East Conference opponent Villanova in February. Coach Auriemma had the team focus on defense, keeping the Huskies in games when their offense was struggling. Nine different players started, and Auriemma tried eleven different starting lineups during the season. By the time Bueckers returned to the lineup for limited minutes, the Huskies were dominating without her. After winning the Big East regular season championship, the team won the 2022 Big East tournament and accepted an automatic bid to the 2022 NCAA Division I tournament.\nAs a number 2 seed in the NCAA tournament, UConn defeated 15th seed Mercer, 7th seed Central Florida, 3rd seed Indiana, and 1st seed North Carolina State to win their region and advance to their 14th consecutive Final Four. The Huskies then beat defending national champion Stanford before losing to South Carolina in the championship game. UConn finished the season with a record of 30–6.\nPrevious season.\nUConn was ranked no. 3 in both the 2020 AP and Coaches pre-season polls. During the regular season, they had a record of 21–1, including 18–0 in the Big East to win the conference regular season championship. In February 2021, they defeated no. 1 ranked South Carolina; it was UConn freshman Paige Bueckers' third straight 30-point game. UConn won the Big East tournament, winning all three of their games by over 30 points. They were ranked no. 1 in both polls at that time. As a no. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, they won their region with a victory over no. 5 ranked Baylor in the Elite Eight. UConn then lost to Arizona in the Final Four and finished their campaign with a record of 28–2. Bueckers, the team's leading scorer, won several awards at the end of the season, including the Naismith College Player of the Year.\nOffseason.\nDepartures.\nThe Huskies lost guards Autumn Chassion and Anna Makurat after the end of the previous season but graduated no seniors. Chassion, who had earned a place on the squad as a walk-on and played in eight games, chose to transfer to Louisiana State University at Eunice after the end of her freshman year. Makurat, who had played in 48 games in her two seasons, ended her time at UConn having averaged 6.5 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game and after entering the NCAA transfer portal, chose instead to return to her native Poland and play professional basketball with AZS AJP Gorzów Wielkopolski of the Basket Liga Kobiet. After the Huskies' first game, freshman Saylor Poffenbarger chose to transfer and then committed to play for Arkansas in late November. On December 13, sophomore forward Mir McLean announced she would be leaving the team at the end of the fall term and later transferred to Virginia.\nIncoming transfers.\nThe Huskies added forward Dorka Juhász, a graduate student transfer from Ohio State. Juhász was twice selected to the All-Big Ten team and averaged 14 points and 11 rebounds per game as a junior. Juhász had two years of eligibility remaining.\nRecruiting.\nThe Huskies had one of the best recruiting classes in the nation. They again signed the top-ranked high school player in Azzi Fudd and added rangy guard Caroline Ducharme and 6-foot-5 forward Amari DeBerry. Saylor Poffenbarger started school during the 2021 spring semester and joined the team in January, but she decided to transfer to Arkansas in November 2021.\nCoaching.\nHall of Fame head coach Geno Auriemma and Hall of Fame associate head coach Chris Dailey returned for their 37th season coaching the team; Auriemma's contract was extended for five years in May. UConn assistant coach and former player Shea Ralph left the program in April to become the head coach at Vanderbilt, leaving assistant coach Jamelle Elliott on the bench. Elliott was an UConn assistant coach from 1998 to 2009 and returned after a nine-year head coaching stint at Cincinnati. Morgan Valley, a three-time national champion as a UConn player, was hired to fill the second assistant role. Since graduation Valley had been an assistant coach with several NCAA programs, and was head coach of the Hartford Hawks when hired to coach the Huskies.\nSeason summary.\nAt the season's outset, the Huskies returned several starters: seniors Christyn Williams, Olivia Nelson-Ododa, and Evina Westbrook, plus accomplished sophomore Paige Bueckers. Westbrook was eligible to enter the 2021 WNBA draft but chose to exercise her redshirt year option to play for the Huskies through her last year of eligibility. Two-time All-Big Ten forward Dorka Juhász, an Ohio State graduate transfer, was expected to add experience and depth in the post. Aubrey Griffin was the sole returning junior. Sophomores Nika Mühl, Aaliyah Edwards, Mir McLean, and Piath Gabriel returned. Highly touted freshman recruits Azzi Fudd, Amari DeBerry, Caroline Ducharme, and Saylor Poffenbarger were expected to compete for playing time.\nIn the season's opening weeks, Griffin was affected by a back problem and missed the entire year due to injury. Poffenbarger and McLean both announced transfers. Towards the end of the team's sixth game, Bueckers suffered a tibial plateau fracture and after surgery was forced to sit out most of the regular season, only returning before the Big East Conference tournament, where she played limited minutes. Guards Fudd and Mühl both suffered early season injuries which caused them to miss several games. Four canceled or postponed contests in December (due to pandemic or travel issues) allowed time for recovery. During the season, eight UConn players missed multiple games due to injury; with forwards Gabriel and DeBerry still in development, sometimes only six players were available for play. The only players able to compete in every regular season game were Westbrook and Edwards. Accordingly, the team tried eleven different starting lineups during the season, with nine different starters and eight different players leading a game in scoring. Caroline Ducharme assumed a scoring role originally anticipated for Fudd, but when Fudd returned both players continued to score effectively. With their scoring threats largely neutralized early in the season, the Huskies focused on defense, limiting their opponents to 54.2 points per game and collecting an average of 9.3 steals and 4.7 blocks per game. Mühl, the vocal floor leader of an aggressive and effective defense, was recognized as Big East Conference defensive player of the year. First team all-conference honors went to seniors Williams and Nelson-Ododa, with Ducharme on the second team. Both Fudd and Ducharme were named to the conference's all-freshman team. Williams won the Ann Meyers Drysdale Award as the best shooting guard in the country. UConn finished the regular season with a record of 22–5; they were 16–1 in conference play.\nAll the Huskies (except for Griffin) were back in playing condition by the time of the Big East Conference tournament, where they dominated all three games, including the tournament final against Villanova, the only Big East team that had defeated UConn during the regular season. In the first ever 68-team NCAA women's March Madness, UConn won games at the Storrs sub-regional against 15th seed Mercer and 7th seed Central Florida to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for a record 28th consecutive appearance. At the Bridgeport regional, the Huskies took a lead in the second quarter against 3rd seed Indiana and never looked back, advancing to a record 16th consecutive Elite Eight. In the regional finals against 1st seed North Carolina State, the teams battled through two overtimes in what game announcers called an \"instant classic,\" and UConn won 91–87 to reach their 14th consecutive Final Four. Juhász suffered a fractured and dislocated wrist in that game and was out for the rest of the tournament. In the Final Four contest, UConn overcame defending national champion Stanford to advance to a rematch against no. 1 South Carolina in the final. In the national championship game, South Carolina jumped out to an 18-point lead while dominating the boards and held off scoring runs to defeat UConn. The Huskies finished the season with a record of 30–6 and were ranked 2nd in the final Coaches poll.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"| Exhibition \n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=|Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"|NCAA tournament"

The Tigers represented the Rochester Institute of Technology and were coached by Wayne Wilson, in his 23rd season.\nSeason.\nAt the start of the season, Wayne Wilson was just 9 wins shy of reaching 400 for his career. RIT shot out of the gate, trying to get their coach to that mark as quickly as they could. The team's good start, which included a surprising win over ranked Notre Dame, got Wilson to the milestone in late November and had the Tigers well positioned in Atlantic Hockey.\nUnfortunately, the winter break and COVID-19 delays combined to stop all of the team's momentum as RIT played just two games (both losses) over the succeeding 6 weeks. A pair of poor stretches in January and February dropped the team down around the .500 mark and saw the Tigers' switch starting goaltenders from Kolby Matthews to Frehshman, Tommy Scarfone. Scarfone had a tough beginning to his college career, allowing 6 goals in his first start (albeit on 45 shots), but made the most of his opportunities afterwards.\nDespite being outscored by a fair margin during the season, RIT's 4th-place finish gave the team a home date for the conference quarterfinals and the Tigers were able to use that advantage to give them a narrow 2–1 series win over Sacred Heart. In their semifinal game, the Tigers answered goals from Air Force on three separate occasions but could not equal the score a fourth time and lost the game 3–4.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "Patrick Terrence Fox (July 6, 1918 – April 1, 1981) was an American football fullback and linebacker who played three seasons in the National Football League (NFL) and All-America Football Conference (AAFC) as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles and Miami Seahawks. He played college football at Miami (FL) and was drafted in the 17th round of the 1941 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nEarly life and education.\nFox was born on July 6, 1918, in Newark, New Jersey. He attended high school in the state before earning a scholarship at University of Miami. He spent 1937–1940 at Miami, earning a varsity letter in his final three seasons. A 1938 advertisement by \"The Miami News\" wrote, \"Here he is, fans: Terry Fox, powerful sophomore fullback who will lead the power plays at Burdine stadium tonight when the University of Miami Hurricanes oppose Tampa's Spartans in the annual football classic between the two schools. He came to us billed as an end. but soon found he liked to buck the line. He's one of the Hurricanes you'd better watch tonight.\" After one of his best games during the 1939 season, which included 149 rushing yards, \"The Miami News\" wrote, \"Twas power night at the stadium and Terry Fox was at the throttle!\" Following his senior season, Fox was a unanimous selection to the all-state team and was considered to be one of the best in the state. He also was named team MVP.\nProfessional career.\nFollowing his college career, Fox was drafted in the 17th round (153rd overall) of the 1941 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He signed his rookie contract on April 15. \"The Miami News\" reported it was believed to be a \"fat contract.\" However, he left the team a few months later and subsequently joined the Philadelphia Eagles in July. Fox played in all eleven games during his rookie season, and started two. Statistically, he made 21 rushing attempts, gaining 97 yards, with a long of 13, and an average of 4.6 per carry. He also recorded six receptions for 71 yards. Following the season Fox called the professional game, \"lots tougher than the college game ... All those guys are tough and you never get a chance to let up.\"\nHe left the Eagles in January after being drafted to serve in World War II as a member of the Marine Air Corps. He enlisted in March, and served the next 42 months overseas. He was able to rise to the rank of captain, commanding Company B, 1st Battalion of the 6th Marines during the campaigns on Salpan, Tinlan and Okinawa. He returned to the Eagles in November 1945, playing in two games.\nHis contract with the team expired the following year and he was signed in March by the Miami Seahawks of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). \"The Miami News\" wrote, \"Harvey Hester, irked enough over \"raiding\" staged by the rival National football league to threaten court proceedings, did a little raiding of his own today by signing Terry Fox, ex-University of Miami fullback and former Philadelphia Eagle, for his Miami pro gridders. \"But he doesn't have a 1946 contract with the Eagles,\" Hester explained In announcing the signing. \"He played three games with the Eagles last year after returning from the marines, but that contract expired.\" \nFox was waived by the Seahawks in early September, but resigned near the end of the month. \"The Miami News\" reported, \" A move believed certain to meet with approval of Miami fans was the rehiring of Terry Fox, former U. Miami fullback and a veteran of four years with the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL. Fox, one of the most popular players ever to appear locally, did not learn of his good fortune until he read about it in the newspapers late yesterday on returning from a fishing trip.\" He appeared in between eight and nine games during the season, compiling 26 rushing yards on 12 carries, just a 2.2 average. He also made two punts for 44 yards on special teams, and three catches for 27 yards receiving. The Seahawks folded following the season, ending his professional career.\nDeath.\nFox died on April 1, 1981, in Miami, at the age of 62 following a heart attack."

        "title": "1940 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1940 Auckland Rugby League season was its 32nd.\nRichmond Rovers won the Fox Memorial Shield for the 4th time after previously winning in 1934, 1935, and 1937. They finished the season with a 12 win, 1 draw, 3 loss record and were 3 points ahead of runner up North Shore Albions, with Mount Albert United in 3rd. Papakura struggled through much of the competition only managing 1 win. They, like many teams had lost playing members to the war effort and were unable to field a reserve grade side.\nRichmond Rovers also won the Roope Rooster knockout competition when they beat Ponsonby United 31–7 in the final. Richmond had made the final by defeating a surprise Papakura side who had beaten Otahuhu Rovers and Manukau on their way to the semi-final. While Ponsonby had thrashed Mount Albert 41–13 in their semi final. After being knocked out of the Roope Rooster, Manukau managed to win the Phelan Shield knockout competition when they defeated Mount Albert 20–14 in the final.\nIn the Stormont Shield, champion of champions match North Shore Albions beat Richmond 15–10. North Shore had qualified for the match by virtue of the fact that they had finished runner up in the championship. Typically the match would be played between the winner of the championship and the winner of the Roope Rooster. But with Richmond winning both trophies the long standing rule was that the championship runner up would play in the match in that eventuality.\nRichmond also won the reserve grade championship (Norton Cup) ahead of Mount Albert. There was very poor coverage of the reserve grade competition and as such a large number of results were not reported and towards the later part of the season match fixtures were not even being published in either \"The New Zealand Herald\" or the Auckland Star. The competition only featured seven of the eight 1st grade senior sides with Papakura not involved. Otahuhu Rovers won the Senior B championship (Sharman Cup) once again. This competition was also very poorly reported though most of Otahuhu's matches did at least have the score reported.\nOwing to the war there were very few representative fixtures. The majority involved matches between Auckland (Tamaki) Māori and Pakehā sides with Auckland Māori playing one match at Davies Park in Huntly against South Auckland (Waikato). At the conclusion of the season a charity type fixture was played between the Auckland Veterans and the South Auckland veterans. Craddock Dufty kicked 5 conversions for the Auckland side in a 31–18 win.\n \n \nAuckland Rugby League News.\nAgreement to commence season with war underway.\nOn 14 February all “units of the Auckland Rugby League… adopted a resolution to carry on football as usual, with the proviso that, if it was necessary to curtail activities, the league would loyally support any government action in this direction”. The difficulties that the league would likely face were discussed at length and some pointed “to the request of Empire authorities that sport should be carried on as normally as possible, given the consensus of opinion being that, by providing the usual facilities for play, the game would be keeping men fit for national emergency”. It was also noted that as all clubs had already lost players to the war effort from the senior and lower grades. The possibility was also suggested of amalgamating clubs to maintain the strength of the competition. The annual report showed that £1537 16s 4d was transferred to the appropriation account. The balance-sheet showed that the assets of the league totaled £11,430 which was an increase of £100 on the previous year.\nAt its 30th annual meeting on 27 March tribute was paid to “the memory of the Rt. Hon. M.J. Savage” and they also “passed a motion of regret at the passing of two supporters, Mr. George Seagar, and international player in his day, and Mr. O. Blackwood”. The board added the name of Mr. W.J. Hammill to the honours board after a suggestion by Mr. E.G. Phelan. Phelan’s name was also subsequently added. Officers were elected as follows: Patron, Mr. J.B. Donald; vice patron, Mr. J.F.W. Dickson; president, Mr. John A. Lee, M.P.; vice presidents, same as last year, with the name of Mr. B. Brigham president of Mount Albert, added: trustees, Messrs. A. Stormont, E.J. Phelan and G. Grey Campbell; junior board chairman, Mr. E. Chapman; club delegates to control board, Messrs. T. Davis, J.W. Probert, T.H.V. Wilson and a member to be appointed, auditor, Mr. R.A. Spinley, F.P.A. (NZ); hon. solicitor, Mr. H.M. Rogerson; junior board secretary, Mr. W.F. Clarke; delegate to Referees’ Appointment Board, Mr. A.C. Gallagher (T. Davis deputy); hon. physicians, Drs. M.G. Pezaro, S. Morris, K.H. Holdgate, J.N. Waddell, G.W. Lock, H. Burrell and W. Bridgman, hon. masseur, Mr. F. Flanagan. Then at the subsequent meeting of the board of control Messrs. Ivan Culpan and J.E. Knowling were reappointed hon. secretary and treasurer respectively, with Mr. R. Doble delegate to the New Zealand Rugby League and also press steward. Messrs. Percy Rogers, A.C. Gallagher and G. Grey Campbell were appointed to the Referees’ Appointment Board), and Messrs. T. Hill and E. Chapman (timekeepers). South Auckland (Waikato) had also applied to enter a team in the Auckland senior competition but the board “decided that owing to various difficulties revealed in consideration of the matter…it could not at present be approved”. It was intended to open the season with preliminary rounds of senior play on 6 and 13 April.\nAt their meeting on 3 April they welcomed new members onto the board, namely Jim Clark, who was a former New Zealand, Auckland, and Ponsonby player and long time official for the Otahuhu club, and Mr. F.M.V. Wilson, who was a former trustee and chairman at Newton Rangers.\nSenior grade eligibility.\nThe ARL senior board proposed to extend “during the duration of the war, the limit of three days to six in the case of juniors being tried out for senior teams before such players are regraded as seniors” however this was strongly opposed by the junior board. The “opinion was expressed that the change would be too detrimental to junior clubs and organisations”. The junior board members were unanimous “that the change would be too drastic, as well as unnecessary, because the quality of a trialist should be measured in three games”. At the 25 April meeting the difficultly that some clubs were experiencing in maintaining full playing strength due to players enlisting in the military forces was discussed. It was “decided that for the duration of the war the rule be waived regarding the nomination of senior reserve and senior B teams”. As teams had to field senior reserve grade teams to qualify to play in the senior grade chairman G Grey Campbell said “It is going to be difficult to keep the senior A teams up to full strength… and as time goes on reserve grade players will be moved up to fill vacancies. In the circumstances the requirements of senior status cannot be enforced”.\nScrum rules.\nAfter several weeks where scrums were an issue during matches it was decided to endeavour to improve them. Chairman Campbell “expressed approval of the suggestion by Mr. Jim Clark regarding the desirability of better understanding on the scrum formation. He said that there was need for improvement in the method of hooking to open up the game. It was decided to hold a conference next week with Messrs. Archie Ferguson, representing the New Zealand Referees’ Association, and Les Bull, chairman of the Auckland Referees’ Association, and Percy Rogers and A.C. Gallagher, of the appointments board”. It was decided that the ball needed to enter the scrum 3 feet and land before players could hook for the ball.\nResignation of Mr. D. Wilkie.\nOn 28 February Mr. D. Wilkie submitted his resignation. He was chairman of the junior control board, and had been on the committee for seven years. He was moving to Ōpōtiki for business reasons.\nPapakura army camp teams.\nAt the board of control meeting on 3 April it was indicated that Papakura Camp teams would most likely be “officially represented in the Auckland Rugby League senior competition”. Captain T.P. Laffey who was the sports organiser of the camp was in attendance at the meeting and he pointed out “that football and other sports were an important integral part of soldier training and it was hoped that the board would admit one or two representative teams in the Auckland league senior competitions”. Chairman Campbell, with other members in agreement, “assured Captain Laffey that the league would welcome teams”. It was also decided that soldiers in uniform “for active service” would be admitted free to Carlaw Park during the season.\nCarlaw Park military activities.\nThe Auckland Rugby League gave permission for Carlaw Park to be used full time by the military for gatherings and training activities starting in September however they were still able to use it for rugby league activities on Saturday’s until the end of the season.\nFred Tottey.\nFred Tottey had moved to New Zealand from Australia and sought to play for Mount Albert. However he had still been under contract with his English club (Halifax) and was not allowed to register in New Zealand without a clearance being granted. As a result he only played two preseason matches and then later registered with rugby, playing a few matches for the Grammar club before returning to Australia.\nWeight increase for junior grades.\nOn 23 April the junior control board granted permission “to raise the weights on all weighted grades by 4lb, the usual allowances to apply. The weighing committee reported that boys were finding difficulty in getting down to the present scale”.\nAuckland representative team.\nAt the 10 April board meeting “acting on the club nomination, a ballot resulted in the election of Messrs. H. (Hec) Brisbane, W. E. (Bill) Cloke, and A. J. (Dougie) McGregor as Auckland senior selectors for the season. McGregor was replacing Bert Avery who had been selector along with Brisbane and Cloke previously.\nObituary.\nJames Rukutai.\nOn 11 January Puhipi James Rukutai died suddenly at his daughters home in Onehunga. He was originally from Kawhia, and a member of the Ngāti Hikairo and Ngāti Hourua tribes. He was educated at St Stephens College. He worked as a miner at Waihi and while there played for the Goldfields rugby team. After moving “to Auckland he became established as a native interpreter, particularly in the Supreme Court, and was advisor in legal matters to a wide circle of his people”. He was “a vigorous supporter of league football, and was a member of one of the representative teams that visited Australia”. Rukutai played for City Rovers in 1910 and 1911 before transferring to the Manukau club for 2 seasons. He later moved back to his former City side from 1913 to 1918 before playing a final season with Māngere United in 1924. Rukutai made 9 appearances for New Zealand Māori in 1909, 18 for Auckland from 1911 to 1918, and 23 for New Zealand from 1911 to 1921. He also coached the 1921 New Zealand team on their tour and coached the New Zealand Māori side from 1922 to 1937. He was also involved in the Auckland Lawn Tennis Association and the Campbell Park Tennis Club. The minor premiership Rukutai Shield was named in his honour and is still competed for today. His funeral was held at the St. James’ Māori cemetery at Māngere. Tawauwau Tapihana and Tema Tewene spoke at his daughters house, paying “tribute to the memory of the departed Rangatira”. The graveside services were conducted by Revs. Tokorau Poihipi and E. Pepemana, and Mr. G. Harrison, Worshipful Master of Lodge Manukau, No. 24, of which Mr. Rukutai was a highly respected officer”. Noted rugby league officials in attendance included the president of New Zealand Rugby League, Mr. J.A. Redwood, and the chairman and deputy chairman of the Auckland Rugby League, Messrs, G. Grey Campbell and E.J. Phelan respectively. The Mayor of Onehunga, Mr. Archer Garside was also present. At a meeting for the Auckland Rugby League on 3 April Mr. H. Walmsley was thanked for “the offer of a special trophy to commemorate the late Mr. James Rukutai”. On 22 May the league read a written submission by a supporter, Mr. D. Philburn that the “Rukutai Trophy” be awarded to the senior team that is leading at the end of the first round in the championship. At the same meeting it was reported that Māori supporters, through Steve Watene “were contributing a sum towards a further special memorial to Mr. J. Rukutai”. With the ARL board subsidising the fund. On 10 July Mr. W.E. Dervan presented the league with a “presentation photograph” of Rukutai. North Shore were the inaugural winners of the Rukutai Shield when they finished the first round with 14 competition points from 7 wins and a loss ahead of Richmond and Manukau who both had 11 competition points. On 23 October a memorial tablet was unveiled in Rukutai’s memory by Ted Phelan. The tablet was inscribed with the words “Ake Ake Kia Pono”.\nWilliam Winter.\nWilliam Wilfred Winter died aged 55 on 6 June. He was a foundation member of Newton Rangers playing for them in 1909 and 1910. He “was a contractor by trade and was responsible for the early laying out of Carlaw Park when that site was a Chinamen’s garden”. He was also on the Ponsonby United committee for several years in the mid 1920s.\nSenior first grade competitions.\nPreliminary rounds.\nPreliminary round 1.\n Roy Mansill debuted for Mount Albert. He was the Auckland amateur sprint champion and the son of Arthur Mansill who played a generation earlier for Newton Rangers. Roy enlisted in the NZ air force as a pilot and was killed on a training flight at RNZAF Base Ohakea in 1945. In the match between Richmond and Marist, Frank Furnell broke his left arm and was taken by ambulance to Auckland Hospital. His arm was set and he was later discharged. Desmond Bilkey of the Papakura side scored the first try of the season and after the match was congratulated by chairman Campbell. Bilkey had recently become the leading half mile runner at the Papakura Athletic Club which was also based at Prince Edward Park in Papakura as was the rugby league club. He enlisted shortly after this photo was taken and went to war. He was wounded in 1945 before returning to New Zealand.\nFox Memorial results.\nRound 4.\nIn the City v Marist game Gordon Crocker of Marist fractured his right forearm and was taken to hospital. Midway through the second half in the match between Newton and Papakura, Harold Milliken of the Papakura side was ordered off. The ARL control board met in committee and decided to stand him down for two playing Saturday’s. Edgar Tredrea scored 2 tries for Newton after being promoted to the senior side. He was the brother of Frank Tredrea, a champion cyclist who went on to represent New Zealand at the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland.\nRound 5.\nIn the match between Mount Albert and Marist, Shadbolt and McLeod were both ordered off near the end of the game. During the week they were severely cautioned by the control board. G.D. (Huck) Flanagan, the hooker for Ponsonby was sent off in their match with Manukau for lifting in the scrums. The referee had been heard by spectators warning Flanagan at the first scrum of the match for lifting, and he also discussed the issue with the Ponsonby captain, intimating “that Flanagan would have to be moved from the position of hooker”. A short time later he “was ordered by the referee to play second row of the pack, an action not considered warranted by members of the Ponsonby side”. He later moved to the prop position and whilst there the referee “decided to order him off”. After the match Flanagan was interviewed and “expressed astonishment at the referee’s action. He stated that, during his 12 years’ experience in club and representative play, his style of hooking had never been questioned”. Other officials who were present refused to give comment on the incident until the referee had given his report to the control board. Flanagan was away on business during the week and so was told to appear before the board a week later. In the meantime the referee said that he had sent him off for repeatedly kicking the ball out of the scrum.\nRound 6.\nThe match between Newton and Mount Albert was played on 25 May as part of a Gala to raise money for the Sick and Wounded Soldiers’ Campaign. The gala featured the senior league match, midget league games, a representative football match, and a relay race between rugby league and football senior players. The rugby league relay team was Roy Nurse (Ponsonby), Robert Cheator (North Shore), Jack Brodrick (Manukau), and either Jim or Chappie Gould from the City club, while the football team was L Needham, G Hutchinson, A Masters, and G Robinson. The football side won the relay race after “the final runner for the rugby league team failed to accept the baton at a stage when a thrilling finish seemed likely”. The football match was drawn between Auckland and ‘The Rest’. Remarkably when the sixth round was complete Ponsonby had still not registered a try through 5 matches (they had a bye in round 1).\nRound 9.\nJ Marsh of Manukau was sent off in their match with North Shore but the referee did not submit a report and so the case lapsed enabling Marsh to play the following week.\nRound 10.\nWith Papakura trailing Richmond 32–2 with 14 minutes their captain Harold Milliken took his side from the field in protest at a refereeing decision by O Chalmers. The incident occurred just after the referee awarded a try to Richmond. After the match Milliken and the referee refused to make a statement but “several members of the Papakura team said that their action had been precipitated by the referee’s decisions, with which they disagreed”.\n The control board met on 10 July to discuss the case and met in committee. It was reported later that the club had apologised for its teams actions and the apology was accepted by the board.\nRound 11.\nPonsonby's win over Papakura was their 200th win in first grade matches stretching back to the inaugural season in 1910. They were the first team to achieve this feat.\nRound 12.\nIn the match between Richmond and North Shore, Charles Webb (Richmond) broke his jaw. He had played on after receiving the injury and was taken to hospital after the match. He had received “a severe blow to the face when endeavouring to tackle an opponent. He appeared slightly dazed for a few seconds, but continued playing throughout the game… at the conclusion of the match he collapsed in the dressing room and an examination revealed a badly fractured jaw”. Bruce Donaldson returned from his dislocated elbow injury received in the match between Auckland Pākehā and Auckland Māori to replace Verdun Scott in the North Shore side who had sprained his ankle after falling heavily in a midweek game of basketball at the Y.M.C.A.\nRound 13.\nIn the City-Marist match the referee G Kelly received a kick and play had to be stopped for him to receive treatment. In the same match Reginald Haslam made a return to the Marist side after not having played for years. He had been an Auckland rugby representative who had played against England in 1930. Papakura began their match with Newton short of players and Francis filled in.\nRound 15.\nIt was reported in the Auckland Star that Verdun Scott was returning from injury however they contradicted their earlier report that said he had received his injury playing basketball at the YMCA, and said that his injury had occurred playing table tennis. His cousin, Len Scott came out of retirement to assist the side for the match.\nRound 17.\nLen Jordan who would later represent New Zealand made his debut for Ponsonby after transferring from Northcote’s senior B side. In the same match former international Brian Riley made his first appearance of the season. The match between Mount Albert and Papakura did not have any point scorers attributed. There was a list published of point scorers to this point of the season which indicated Bert Leatherbarrow had 65 points from 15 tries and 10 goals which suggested that he must have scored 2 tries and kicked 6 goals in the match. Papakura had many injuries and had to play the second half with just 11 players at which time the score was 29–22.\nRound 18.\nSomewhat confusingly the ARL originally decided to just play the Mount Albert – Richmond game in round 18. Richmond had already secured the title but the runner up needed to be decided in the event of Richmond also winning the Roope Rooster as this would mean the Stormont Shield would need to be played against the genuine second place getter. Mount Albert complicated matters by upsetting Richmond which then tied them for second with North Shore. In order to make it fair North Shore then played their round 18 match 2 weeks later against Newton at the Devonport Domain. They won 33–15 to finish runner up on their own. With little riding on the game for Newton they fielded several 3rd grade players. Ultimately Richmond did indeed win the Roope Rooster meaning they played North Shore in the Stormont Shield with the Devonport based side winning.\nRoope Rooster.\nOtahuhu United, who had won the Senior B competition were given permission to play in the Roope Rooster competition. They were defeated by Papakura in the first round by 23 points to 9.\nRound 2.\nIn the match between Papakura and Manukau, Selwyn Jackson made his debut for Manukau. He was a Hawkes Bay rugby representative and had gone on the 1938 tour of Fiji with New Zealand Māori. Bob Banham played his last match for Mount Albert before returning to Australia.\nPhelan Shield.\nRound 3.\nW Mataira was sent off for City in their match with Papakura.\nFinal.\nFollowing the Phelan Shield final Bert Leatherbarrow announced that he was retiring. An article in the Auckland Star said “he made a start with football when seven years of age and was then goalkeeper for the North Shore fifth grade soccer football team. In his school days at Devonport he played rugby, and he also played rugby in North Auckland and Taranaki. Then he played league in the North Shore junior grades”. Leatherbarrow was selected in the New Zealand side in 1939.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\n \nSenior reserve competitions.\nA huge number of matches in the reserve grade competition were neither listed in the newspaper nor had their result reported. As such the records are very incomplete. It wasn’t until mid September that it was reported that Richmond had won the reserve grade competition. Most teams would have played approximately 11 games but the majority had less than half their scores reported. Papakura did not field a reserve grade team most likely due to the effect of World War 2 on playing numbers.\nStallard Cup (knockout competition).\nSeveral of the fixtures were not reported in the newspapers including the final. The knockout competition was between reserve grade sides and the senior B teams.\nSenior B grade competitions.\nSharman Cup results.\nR.V. withdrew their senior B team after the first round. It is unlikely that they played their opening match against Northcote. There we no fixtures or results recorded in round 9.\nKnockout competition.\nIn recent seasons when the senior B championship had concluded a 'knockout' competition was held which was run more as a full round robin than a knockout. It featured Otahuhu United, Point Chevalier, Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers, and Ellerslie United. The competition was named \"Walmesley Shield\" in previous seasons but the name was not used in 1940. Otahuhu United won after beating their other 3 opponents over consecutive weekends.\nOther club matches and lower grades.\nLower grade clubs.\nThe Intermediate Primary Schools competition was reportedly won by Newton however later in the year it was reported that Marist beat R.V. by 5 points to 3 which drew the two teams level in the competition and they therefore shared the title however there was no Marist team competing in the grade so it is probably in error and for a different grade or competition. It was also reported that Mount Albert beat Avondale 16–0 in the Intermediate grade final though this was likely for the A section winner. It is possible that Mount Albert was defeated by Newton in a playoff between the winners of the two sections.\nGrades were made of the following teams with the winning team in bold:\nSchoolboys\nOther senior club matches.\nSouth Auckland v Manukau XIII.\nThe team which represented Manukau included players from other clubs. When Jack Brodrick went off injured in the first half he was replaced by Briggs of Ponsonby.\nManukau v Huntly.\nOn 10 August when Manukau had a bye in the Fox Memorial Shield competition they arranged a friendly match with Huntly at Waikaraka Park in Onehunga. The visitors won 23 points to 13.\nChallenge Match.\nOn 24 August a match was played between Richmond, the winner of the Auckland club championship and the winner of the Waikato club championship, Huntly South.\nNorth Shore v Huntly.\nNorth Shore travelled to Huntly to play the local side on 7 September. Only the score was reported though it was noted that the Huntly side was similar to the one which had defeated Richmond two weeks earlier.\nStratford v City.\nIn September City travelled to Stratford with their senior team and their reserve side. The senior side lost to Stratford 9–5.\nTauranga Māori v Manukau (rugby union game).\nAt the end of the season the Manukau side travelled to Tauranga to play a local side in a game of rugby union which was not unprecedented for them. A large number of the Manukau side had grown up playing rugby union and been recruited to the Manukau club directly out of that code. Several of these players who were named in the Manukau side to play included former rugby union players: Tom Chase, Pita Ririnui, and Jack Hemi amongst others. A collection was taken at the game to give to 'patriotic funds'. Jack Hemi, well known for his prodigious kick sent the opening kickoff over the dead ball line and when converting Cato's try at the end of the match from the halfway line jokingly \"trickled\" it a few yards. He was then asked to make a proper effort and from the centre spot on halfway slammed it through the posts but was not awarded the points.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nAuckland Māori v South Auckland (Waikato).\nErnie Asher was appointed the coach of the Māori side.\nAuckland Māori v Auckland Pākehā (James Carlaw Memorial Trophy).\nThe match between Auckland Māori and Pākehā was originally scheduled to be played on 1 June to celebrate Kings Birthday however due to war being well underway his birthday was not being officially celebrated so it was thought inappropriate to play the match as part of the ‘non existent’ celebrations. Bruce Donaldson dislocated his elbow during the match and missed several club games.\nAuckland Schoolboys Team.\nIn August an Auckland schoolboys representative side was selected to travel to New Plymouth to play a Taranaki team. They left by train on 22 August and played their match on Saturday, the 23rd. Auckland won the match 39 points to 3. The team selected was Glean (Ellerslie, Keene, Belsham, Walker (Newton), Purvan (Ponsonby), Robinson, Watson, Clarke, Reeve, Flanagan (Richmond), Smith (North Shore), Robinson (Northcote), and Reilly (Green Lane) with two more to be chosen at a later date (the team had been named on 15 August). L Rout and J Silva were named as the team managers to accompany them on the tour.\nAnother schoolboys side was selected to play a match against 'The Rest' on 19 October as a curtain-raiser to the Auckland Veterans v South Auckland Veterans side. The result was not reported.\nThird Grade representative teams.\nOn 31 August a 3rd grade representative match was played at Carlaw Park between a suburban 3rd grade representative side and a town representative side. It was a curtain-raiser to the Auckland Māori v Auckland Pakehā match. The result was not reported.\nThe teams were as follows; \nTown: Bob Scott, B. Thomas, R.D. Elliot (Ponsonby), K.J. Hagen, H.L. Burton, J. Brady (Newton), C.D. Lorimer, E. McCarthy, J. Brown, H. Phillips, F.R. Williams, A.R. Turner, P.M. Virtue (Richmond), E.H. James, E. Sexton, A.J.B. Donovan (Marist), W. Burgoyne, H.

Weigel (Avondale).\nAnnual General Meetings and Club News.\nAuckland Rugby League Junior Management Committee.\nOn 19 March the junior management held their annual meeting.

Chairman Campbell said that City had applied just prior to the game starting and it was granted pending confirmation at the first meeting following the match. On 1 May the Ellerslie club sent a deputation to the control board meeting asking for support “in the matter of contribution to the borough’s effort to raise funds for the erection of an ambulance room on” the ground they used. “Mr. J. McInnarney appealed for the staging of a senior match at Ellerslie later in the season.

The council granted permission.\nOtahuhu Rugby League Football Club.\nOn 22 April the Ōtāhuhu Borough Council met and “on the advice of the legal and finance committee it was resolved to charge the [Otahuhu] league football club 5/ per week during the season for the use of the playing ground in Hutton Street, plus £2 12/ per year for the use of the ground on which the training shed stands”. In the middle of the year the club sent a deputation to the Otahuhu Borough Council meeting complaining of being “charged for use of water for which they had not received an account for seven years”. A member of the council said that they statement should be withdrawn as the council had duplicates of the accounts which proved that the league club had in fact received annual accounts. The council said that they would reconsider the charge of £2 12/ per year for the use of the playing area. Following a meeting of the Otahuhu Borough Council in early July they invited any member of the rugby league club who was a ratepayer in the area to “peruse office documents regarding the letting of Sturges Park to the rugby union. In regard to the water account owing by the [Otahuhu league] club, which they allege went to the sister code, the town clerk stated that carbon copies inspected by the parks committee prove that with one exception accounts were addressed correctly”.

Each man was presented with an inscribed wristlet watch. Walsh and Williams had “been in office since 1936”.\nRichmond Rovers Football Club.\nThey held their annual meeting in late March with Mr. B.W. Davis presiding.

Dick; club captain, Mr. R. Hyland; schoolboys’ delegate, Mr. E.J. McCarthy; auditor, Mr. J.A. Redwood.\nTransfers and registrations.\nOn 10 April an unnamed club sought to register J.A. Flower (Kogorah, New South Wales). He had “signed up with an Auckland club [Ponsonby] in June last year, but had not played”.

        "text": "The 2021–22 Michigan Tech Huskies men's ice hockey season was the 101st season of play for the program and 4th in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). They represented Michigan Technological University, played their home games at MacInnes Student Ice Arena and were coached by Joe Shawhan, in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nMichigan Tech joined with six other members of the WCHA to restart the CCHA for the 2021–22 season. The Huskies had a rocky start to their season; after sweeping their first weekend, the team lost at least one game in each of the next five weeks. While their opposition was nothing to sneeze at, Tech was unable to distance itself from the crowd and subsequently fell out of the polls. The cause for their inconsistent play was just as mercurial; some times the offense would not be able to get on track while at other times the goaltending wasn't quite up to par. One thing that did carry over from game to game was the defense, which did a tremendous job limiting the opposition's chances to the tune of less than 22 shots a game.\nNear the end of November the Huskies looked to be getting themselves in order when they swept two weekends sandwiched around a losing effort against Minnesota State. The improvement in their play enabled the team to get back into the polls and remain there even after a less-than-stellar Great Lakes Invitational.\nTech was limited to just 4 games in January, due to positive COVID-19 tests around the college hockey landscape, but the team used its time off to great effect and went on a winning streak when they finally got back onto the ice. Michigan Tech went 8–0–1 through mid-February and rose up to 14 in the polls. More importantly, the team got into the top 10 in the PairWise rankings, which would guarantee them a spot in the NCAA tournament. The strong play in the second half also put the Huskies in a position to win the regular season crown if it could sweep its final four games, however, after going into overtime twice against Ferris State, their longshot hopes were dashed.\nIn the first CCHA tournament in 9 years, the Huskies were again pressed by Ferris State, needing overtime in both contests. Their special teams play saved their season as MTU scored 2 power play goals, 1 shorthanded goal and on a penalty shot. Their offense continued to sputter in the semifinal but they were also let down by a defensive breakdown in the third that saw Bemidji State score three times in under 5 minutes. The loss dropped the Huskies to 12 in the PairWise but that was well within the margin for at-large teams and Tech made it back to the tournament for the first time in four years.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Huskies received a #3 seed for the tournament but were a sizable underdog to Minnesota Duluth, who were coming off of their 4th-consecutive Frozen Four. Their chances in the game were dealt a serious blow just 3 minutes into the game when their leading scorer, and Hobey Baker Award finalist, Brian Halonen received a controversial major penalty for boarding and was ejected from the game. Afterwards the offense was never able to get on track; while Tech got several shots on goal, few were high-level scoring chances and the team were held off by a very strong Bulldog defense. The only saving grace for MTU was that Pietila kept them in the game and the Huskies were still just one shot away from tying the score entering the third period. As the offense tried to rise to the occasion, Eric Gotz lost the puck on a pass up the ice and the turnover was immediately fired into the Tech goal. The second Duluth goal took most of the energy out of the Huskies. While they did try to claw their way back late, they could never get the puck past Ryan Fanti and an empty-netter sealed their fate.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2021–22 Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 78th season of play for the program. They represented the University of Minnesota Duluth in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 9th season in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). The Bulldogs were coached by Scott Sandelin, in his 22nd season, and played their home games at AMSOIL Arena.\nSeason.\nFresh off of their 4th consecutive frozen four, Minnesota Duluth entered the season as one of the favorites for the National Championship. Early on, the team lived up to expectations and compiled a 6–2 record by early November with all of their games coming against ranked teams. Leading the way was junior netminder, Ryan Fanti, who had taken over the starting role the year before and seemed to be performing even better. He rang up three consecutive shutouts with the help of a lock-down defense and led the Bulldogs to a #1 ranking by the beginning of December.\nFanti's turn in goal was interrupted when he tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced to sit out a road series against Northern Michigan. With nominal backup Zach Stejskal undergoing treatment for testicular cancer, the team turned to their third goalie, Ben Patt. The redshirt senior's first career starts turned out poorly and he allowed 5 goals in both games. The losses sent UMD tumbling from the top of the national rankings and began a stretch of poor performances from the club.\nDuluth got Fanti back in goal the following week and earned a split with Denver but then took a couple of weeks off for the winter break. Upon their return, the Bulldogs faced down the team that had replaced them as the #1 squad, Minnesota State. The Mavericks swept UMD in the home-and-home series, demonstrating that the Bulldogs' biggest weakness was their lack of offensive punch. The week after, the entire program was hit by COVID-19 and a series with St. Cloud State was postponed until later in the season. When the team finally got back into their routine, they were inconsistent and played .500 hockey over the next month.\nThough the results weren't sterling, Minnesota Duluth benefitted from their difficult schedule and still remained well within the top-10. However, a sweep at the hands of North Dakota in mid-February put the team in a precarious position. After the losses, UMD's record stood at just 2 games over .500 and a poor performance over the remainder of their season could knock them out of the NCAA tournament. The Bulldogs split their final five games of the season, dropping the team to #10 in the rankings. While their collective heads were still above water, the Bulldogs had little margin for error and would need to defeat St. Cloud State to ensure a place in the national tournament.\nNCHC Tournament.\nBefore postseason play even began, Duluth got a leg-up on their competition when St. Cloud's starter, Dávid Hrenák, came down with pneumonia. Fanti did not play at his best but the Bulldogs' offense was able to light up the Huskies' backup and scored 9 goals in two games, their best output all season. Beginning with the semifinals, the defense returned to their early-season form and dominated the rest of the tournament. UMD shut down two of the nations top offenses and captured the program's third NCHC championship. The win pushed Minnesota Duluth up to 6 in the rankings, good enough for a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Bulldogs began their run against Michigan Tech and received a boon early in the game. The Huskies' leading scorer, Brian Halonen, was called for boarding and received a controversial game-misconduct penalty. Without their top offensive threat, Tech was unable to generate much in the way of offensive chances for a majority of the game. UMD scored three unassisted goals in the game, two coming from Kobe Roth, and skated to a comfortable 3–0 victory.\nUMD faced down Denver in the quarterfinals and were on the back foot almost from the start of the game. The defense did its best impression of a wall and held the Pioneers back. Duluth managed to score first on just their second shot of the period and looked to be gearing up for a 4th-consecutive shutout. Unfortunately, Fanti's streak was ended a few minutes later after a shot was deflected into the cage. Denver remained the better of the two teams for the balance of the match and stopped Duluth from gaining the lead a second time, despite the Bulldogs receiving a 5-on-3 power play in the second period. In the end it took a crazy series of bounces for the winning goal to be scored but it was Duluth that fell victim to their own mediocre offense.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "2021–22 Minnesota State Mavericks men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2021–22 Minnesota State Mavericks men's ice hockey season was the 53rd season of play for the program. They represented Minnesota State University, Mankato in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 1st season in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). They are coached by Mike Hastings, in his 10th season, and play their home games at Mayo Clinic Health System Event Center.\nSeason.\nMinnesota State joined with six other members of the WCHA to restart the CCHA for the 2021–22 season. With their new conference being relatively weak in national rankings, the Mavericks scheduled several games against non-conference opponents that were expected to be very strong. MSU kicked off the season with a road series against the defending national champions Massachusetts. Dryden McKay, who was just 3 shutouts shy of tying the career record of 27 held by Ryan Miller, kicked off the campaign with an 18-save blanking of the Minutemen. That game set te tone for the entire season; Minnesota State relied on a constant offensive attack that kept the puck in their opponent's end. Holding to the maxim 'the best defense is a good offense', MSU stopped most of their opponents from generating offensive chances by forcing them to defend. When their defense was called upon, the corps, led by Jake Livingstone and captain Wyatt Aamodt, was up to the task and limited the opposing forwards to fewer than 20 shots on goal on most nights. Of those reduced shots, only a paltry number managed to get past McKay.\nThe Mavericks began the season by playing both of the finalists from the previous year's national championship and won three out of four games. For their third week, the team participated in the Ice Breaker Tournament and lost the championship game to Michigan, the then-#3 team in the country. While the defeat cost MSU their #1 ranking, they were still left with a very strong resume as they entered their conference schedule.\nAfter sweeping Northern Michigan, which included McKay's record-breaking shutout, Minnesota State played probably its worst game of the season against lowly Ferris State. While the Mavs could only manage a single goal, the defense allowed the Bulldogs to get 30 shots on McKay, the most they would allow all season. The team responded by flattening their foes over the next couple of weeks, winning their next five games by an average score of nearly 6–1, including two more shutouts. While the CCHA's overall weakness held Minnesota State back, the sheer number of victories and the overwhelming nature of play could not be ignored and MSU received the #1 ranking for the second time in late-November.\nMcKay was forced to miss the team's first game against Lake Superior State, giving freshman Keenan Rancier his first career start. While the backup played well, allowing just 1 goal, the team's offense fell flat and they were shutout for the only time on the season. McKay returned the following night and began a run of games that was nearly unheard of in NCAA history; Minnesota State won each of their next nine games with McKay allowing a maximum of 1 goal in each affair. The stretch of 12 consecutive games by MSU of allowing less than 2 goals was the longest in Division I history. The five shutouts recorded during that run put McKay at 32 for his career and 8 on the season. He was not, however, alone for lofty goaltending statistics. both Yaniv Perets and Devon Levi were also having magical seasons for their respective programs, leading some to call the 2022 season as the 'Year of the Goaltender'.\nWhen Minnesota State lost its fifth game of the season, they were firmly established one of the two best teams in the country (Michigan being the other). MSU was top three in both goals for and goals against as well as boasting the nation's scoring leader Nathan Smith. With that in mind, there was little surprise when, after the NHL backed out of the 2022 Winter Olympics, head coach Mike Hastings was added to Team USA's coaching staff. Smith joined soon afterwards but, despite persistent rumors, Dryden McKay was not included on the roster.\nMSU did not lose a beat in their absence and won their final eleven regular season games. In winning 20 out of 21 games, Minnesota State became one of the select few teams to post 30 wins during the regular season and were rewarded by nearly sweeping the CCHA awards. They were also mathematically guaranteed to make the NCAA tournament and receive a favorable seeding for at least the opening round.\nCCHA tournament.\nThe Mavericks continued their inspired play in the postseason, posting a pair of wins over St. Thomas to all but guarantee MSU one of the four #1 seeds. A demolition of Northern Michigan, who had upset the Mavs the year before, sealed a top seed and set the team up for a showdown against Bemidji State. The Beavers were fighting for a tournament appearance, being ranked too low to earn an at-large bid, and gave the Mavericks everything they had. MSU was held scoreless for more than half the game and, when Bemidji netted the first goal around the mid-way point of the match, it appeared that the boys in green may have had a chance. Fortunately for the Mavericks, their power play, which had been a strength for them all season, provided them with the tying goal and forced the game into overtime. Less than three minutes into the extra session, The puck found its way into the Bemidji cage and Minnesota won the revived CCHA championship.\nHalf an hour later, after hoisting the trophy and heading to the locker room, both teams were called back onto the ice. While the goal was initially ruled to be a 'good goal', a camera angle that had initially not been available to replay showed conclusively than the puck had gone under the goal cage rather than through the 4-by-6 opening. The goal was waved off and both teams were recalled to the ice to resume the game. Luckily for the Mavericks, their very next shot went into the goal cleanly and they were able to celebrate a championship after was is described as 'the craziest championship ever'. The win was also McKay's 35 victory on the season, breaking the record that had jointly been held by college hockey legends Robb Stauber and Marty Turco.\nNCAA tournament.\nMSU received the #2 overall seed and began their run facing Harvard, the ECAC Hockey champion. The first 35 minutes of the game was a complete mismatch. The Mavericks scored the first three goals and were completely dominating the Crimson in shots and offensive zone time. Everything changed in the later part of the second period when Sean Farrell fired a puck from behind the goal line that deflected in off of McKay's skate. Less than a minute later Harvard netted their second goal and had reduced the Mavericks' advantage to just 1. Ondřej Pavel scored on a rush early in the third to put a little distance between the two but Harvard would not go away and they netted a third marker on the power play with 3:31 left on the clock. The Crimson went on a furious charge at the MSU cage and twice had looks at a half-open cage. Luck was with the Mavs, however, as both shots went awry and Minnesota State escaped with a 4–3 victory.\nThe quarterfinal match against Notre Dame turned into a classic goaltending battle with both McKay and Matthew Galajda playing nearly perfect games. While MSU more than doubled up the Irish in shots over the first 20 minutes, they were only able to sneak the final one into the goal with just 16 seconds remaining in the period. Smith's marker remained the only goal for the rest of the contest as both teams attacked relentlessly but to no avail. Vital to the win was MSU's penalty-kill which held Notre Dame back during their three man-advantages.\nIn the national semifinals, which consisted entirely of western teams, Minnesota State faced off against Minnesota. Though the two had never had much of a rivalry, this was the second time in as many years that they were meeting in the NCAA tournament. As they had all season, MSU shot out of the gate and dominated play for most of the match. It was the Gophers, however, who opened the scoring in the first. The Mavericks were undeterred and continued to assail the Minnesota net. They finally managed to break through midway through the second and that began a deluge of goals. Minnesota State scored the final 5 markers to take the game comfortably and send the team to its first ever Division I championship game appearance.\nThe final game of the year looked to be following a familiar format when Minnesota State controlled the puck from the opening faceoff and outshout Denver 18–8 through the first 40 minutes. Despite the disparity in play, the Mavericks only enjoyed a 1–0 lead entering the third and little room for error with how well Denver's defense was playing. In the final frame, MSU appeared to move away from the constant attack that was the hallmark of the team and played a more traditional defensive shell. This maneuver proved disastrous for the club as it allowed the Pioneers to get their offense flowing. Denver scored three times in the third and a shell-shocked Mavericks team scrambled to respond. They ended up being forced into pulling McKay for an extra attacker but all that served to do was give Denver two empty-net goals. When the final buzzer sounded, one bad period had completely sunk Minnesota State's entire season and ruined the championship hopes for the school.\nDoping ban.\nAfter the season, it was reported that Dryden McKay, who had by then won the Hobey Baker Award, accepted a 6-month suspension from international hockey for testing positive for a banned substance. The United States Anti-Doping Agency could have imposed as much as a 4-year suspension, however, the body accepted the evidence that McKay provided which proved he had unwittingly consumed the substance as part of an effort to combat COVID-19. On the weekend that the team was to play Lake Superior State, a strain of the flu was going around the Mavericks' locker room. Compounded with increased worries over the Omicron variant, McKay took non-NSF-certified antiviral supplements over the course of 10 days that had been contaminated with Ostarine. The drug is typically used to combat muscle wasting and osteoporosis and has been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency since 2008.\nMcKay had submitted the sample on January 23 and the results were available by January 31. Because this occurred prior to the start of the Olympics, it was likely the primary reason that McKay was left off the United States Olympic roster. Minnesota State had given a mandatory provisional suspension to McKay on February 3 but had lifted the prohibition on the same day. Since Ostarine was detected in a sealed bottle sent to a testing lab by the manufacturer, McKay was determined to have not been at fault for the positive test and remained eligible to play for the remainder of the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2021–22 Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey season was the 59th season of play for the program. They represented the Ohio State University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. This season marked the ninth season in the Big Ten Conference. They were coached by Steve Rohlik, in his ninth season, and played their home games at Value City Arena.\nSeason.\nEntering the season, Ohio State was picked to finish last in the Big Ten. The Buckeyes, however, began the season well, winning three of their first four games. While the victories helped, the first few weeks also settled the goaltending competition when freshman Jakub Dobeš established himself as the starter over Ryan Snowden. Ohio State was able to use stellar performances from the Czech goalie to dramatically exceed expectations for the year.\nAfter beginning their conference schedule, OSU swept Penn State and then earned splits with Michigan, Minnesota and Notre Dame, all ranked teams. While their record wasn't particularly outstanding by the end of December, Ohio State had played well enough to rise up to 17th in the ranking, putting them in a prime position to make the NCAA Tournament. In the first half of the year, Ohio State's offense was clicking along at more than three goals per game and was performing very consistently, being held under 3 goals on just five occasions.\nThe Buckeyes played even better after the Winter Break, losing just once in twelve games. While their opponents weren't particularly strong, OSU was able to get up to 8th in the polls and, more importantly, they were in the top 10 of the PairWise rankings. All the Buckeyes needed to guarantee themselves a spot in the tournament was a win or two in the final few weeks of the season but, just as they were ready to make postseason plans, the wheels came off.\nOhio State's final two opponents were top two teams in the conference, Minnesota and Michigan. Both were playing at a very high level while the Buckeyes were seemingly coasting into the conference tournament. The OSU offense, a strength all season, failed. The team scored just 6 goals in 4 games. Worse, Dobeš didn't play particularly well as the team allowed 8 goals against in both weekends and were swept by both teams. The four consecutive losses could not have come at a worse time, dropping Ohio State down the rankings, but the team's postseason hopes were still alive due to the strength of their conquerors.\nOhio State sat 13th in the PairWise as they began the Big Ten Tournament. While the top 10 were automatically qualified for the NCAA tournament, the next 6 could receive bids based on postseason results. As long as Ohio State got out of the conference quarterfinals, they would likely receive an at-large bid. Their opponent, Penn State, had had a dreadful conference season; despite being just one place behind the Buckeyes, PSU was 22 points lower in the standings. The first game went to script for OSU as the offense seemed to get back on track but it was the defense that looked to be a problem. While they won 4–3, Ohio State allowed 52 shots against and that trend continued over the next two games. Penn State carried the bulk of the play, outshooting the Buckeyes by at least 10 in each of the three games. While Ohio State was able to score in the first match, they faltered in games 2 and 3, allowing the Nittany Lions to win both and potting themselves on the postseason bubble.\nAfter losing the series, Ohio State was dropped down to 15 in the PairWise. Because none of the Atlantic Hockey teams were in the top 16, that was the lowest possible position that could make the tournament. Ohio State could only wait and hope that there were no upsets for any of the five other conference championships. The next week the team got a slight boost when both the Big Ten and NCHC all advanced teams that were guaranteed bids to their respective championships but they had to hold their breath as spoilers from the CCHA, ECAC and Hockey East continued. On the final day of conference play, Ohio State needed each of those three championship games to go a specific way but they could only get two. When Harvard won the ECAC championship, Ohio State was knocked out and their season was over.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Before the season, the NCAA reversed its decision and ruled him eligible. On March 5, 2021, Flowers posted a season-high 34 points, five rebounds and four assists in an 80–72 victory against Louisiana–Monroe at the first round of the Sun Belt tournament.

The Wildcats represented Northern Michigan University and were coached by Grant Potulny, in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nNorthern Michigan joined with six other members of the WCHA to restart the CCHA for the 2021–22 season. They opened their season with a weekend sweep but then ran into trouble with a 5-game losing skid. While the offense was able to produce, the Wildcats did not receive adequate goaltending from Rico DiMatteo. Come November, however, the results began to improve and Northern Michigan rose a high-octane offense to a winning record. The team's attack was led by Hank Crone and A. J. Vanderbeck, both of whom would finish among the national scoring leaders. The best performance on the season came in early December when NMU took on then-#1 Minnesota Duluth and swept both games. While the Bulldogs were forced to use their third string goalie due to illness and injury, putting up 5 goals in both games against one of the nation's top defenses was still impressive. The victories also garnered Northern Michigan with their first ranking of the season and set the team up as a possible surprise for the NCAA Tournament. Unfortunately, the Wildcats ended the first half of their year getting swept by Lake Superior State and immediately dropping out of the polls.\nThe second half of the season began well for the Wildcats and when the team split a weekend with Minnesota State they reentered the top-20. After a week off, the team was again stymied by the Lakers and kicked out of the rankings. More importantly, however, was that DiMatteo's play in net had become so inconsistent that the team turned to freshman Charlie Glockner. The new starter immediately provided a boost in goal and the team tried to make a bid for a home site in the postseason, but their 1–3 record versus Lake Superior ultimately left them in the 5th position.\nThe Wildcats had to travel to Sault Ste. Marie to take on their long-time rival but their powerful offense, which had carried them to victory so often during the season, gave Northern Michigan the edge. After splitting the first two games, NMU found itself down 1–3 mid-way through the deciding game but then went on a rampage in the Lakers' zone. In exactly 8 minutes of game time, Northern Michigan scored four goals and took a commanding 5–3 lead. Glockner was able to hold off Lake Superior for most of the third and give the Wildcats a date in the conference semifinal. There they found Minnesota State waiting for them but the Mavericks were looking for revenge. NMU had downed Minnesota State in the semis the year before and MSU was going to make sure there was no repeat. Northern Michigan was completely swamped, getting outshot 21–34 and outscored 1–8. While the end of their season wasn't pretty, the team had been able to provide some stunning highlights during the year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

They represented the University of Nebraska Omaha in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 9th season in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). The Mavericks were coached by Mike Gabinet, in his fifth season, and played their home games at Baxter Arena.\nSeason.\nOmaha began its season with a tremendous run, winning seven consecutive games during the month of October. The extended winning streak vaulted the Mavericks into a top-10 ranking but it did come with a caveat. All of their early-season matches came against relatively weak non-conference opponents and wouldn't provide much assistance in the team's bid for an NCAA appearance. That didn't seem like much of a problem when Omaha earned a road split with top-ranked St. Cloud State, but the Mavericks didn't help themselves with inconsistent performances against the two worst teams in the NCHC.\nAfter returning from the winter break, Omaha continued their up-and-down play with a split against unranked St. Lawrence that put them in the final potential at-large position. They were forced to postpone their series the following week due to COVID-19 but suffered a greater loss when they were swept by Denver afterwards.\nOmaha was unable to arrest its downward slide for a while, splitting three consecutive weekends and then bottoming out with a sweep at the hands of Miami in mid-February. The losses to the RedHawks knocked Omaha out of the polls entirely and made it all but impossible for the team to make the NCAA tournament without a conference championship. While the team finished strong in the final three weeks, Omaha sat mired in 6th place with a losing conference record.\nIsaiah Saville remained in goal for the Mavericks as they began postseason play. Omaha managed to gain a lead in the first game and were ahead at the start of the third, however, they were facing one of the top offenses in the country in Western Michigan and the Broncos stormed back with a 3-goal third period to take the match. The second game had a similar pattern with Omaha gaining a 3–1 lead mid-way through the contest, only to see their advantage erased with WMU netted three goals in less than 5 minutes. The Mavs were able to tie the game in the third period but could not get the game-winner and ultimately fell in overtime.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The Lindenwood Lions men's ice hockey team represents the Lindenwood University in NCAA Division I ice hockey. The program had won four club National Championships prior to its promotion to varsity status.\nHistory.\nLindenwood founded its men's program as a club team in 2003. From its inception, the Lions performed well on the ice, winning 25 out of 29 games in its first year. As the team's schedule increased in difficult, head coach Derek Schaub was able to keep the program in good standing and got the Lions to post a 30-win season 2008. That season saw the team reach the championship game but it was only the beginning for the Lions. The following year Lindenwood was a juggernaut, going 42–4 and winning their first championship while outscoring opponents 313 to 77. After a second dominating championship in 2010, Schaub stepped down and turned the team over to assistant coach and former NHL player, Rick Zombo.\nUnder Zombo's leadership the Lions continued to be a national contender, reaching the championship in his first season and eventually winning their third title in 2016. While the men's team was achieving those heights, they were overshadowed by the women's team, which had won three consecutive American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) championships and been promoted to Division I in 2011. In 2021 the school announced its plan to have the men's team finally follow the Lady Lions into the varsity ranks and the program began to transition in that direction.\nWhile the school did not officially state that the team would be a Division I program in 2022, multiple news reports indicate the program was on track to secure the needed funding. Critically, the COVID-19 pandemic did not appear to have hampered plans for the program's promotion. Furthering the potential viability of the team is its current home, the Centene Community Ice Center. With a seating capacity of 2,500, the building is comparable to other Division I programs, particularly for a school that only boasts a student body of approximately 7,500.\nIn the 2021 offseason, the team also began seeing its first transfers into the program from Division I programs (Kyle Jeffers), demonstrating the confidence that some have in Lindenwood's progress. Lindenwood's promotion made the Lions the first Division I program in the St. Louis area since Saint Louis University discontinued their program in 1979.\nOn March 23, 2022, Lindenwood officially announced that its men's ice hockey team would join Division I in the fall. The team finished its final club season with a 22–3 record and won their fourth ACHA National Championship.\nLindenwood will be eligible for postseason participation in 2026–27, its first full season of D-I membership.\nSeason-by-season results.\n&lt;br&gt;\nCoaches.\nRick Zombo was retained as the team's head coach when it transitioned to Division I status in 2022. After two seasons, it was announced that he would not return.\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\""

        "title": "2022 Formula Regional European Championship",
        "text": "The 2022 Formula Regional European Championship by Alpine was a multi-event, Formula Regional open-wheel single seater motor racing championship held across Europe. The championship featured a mix of professional and amateur drivers, competing in Formula Regional cars that conform to the FIA Formula Regional regulations for the championship. This was the fourth season of the championship and the second after a merger with Formula Renault Eurocup which resulted to the change of the engine supplier to Alpine. The season commenced on 22 April at Autodromo Nazionale Monza and concluded on 23 October at Mugello Circuit, after ten rounds.\nPrema Racing won their third teams' championship at Barcelona, with two races to spare. Their driver Dino Beganovic won the drivers' championship, with one race to spare. Leonardo Fornaroli, driving for Trident, won the rookie title.\nTeams and drivers.\nTwelve teams were pre-selected on 12 November 2021; JD Motorsport's entry and assets were taken over by Trident. On 23 February 2022, new team Race Performance Motorsport was announced to have taken over DR Formula's entry.\nRace calendar.\nThe calendar was revealed on 25 October 2021.\nSeason summary.\nFirst half.\nThe fourth season of the championship began in late April at Monza with Dino Beganovic on pole for the wet season opener. He kept the lead at the start, while Lorenzo Fluxá next to him dropped back behind Gabriele Minì and Michael Belov, before repassing the Russian. A collision in turn one resulted in the first safety car. On the restart, Belov got Fluxá back while Minì collided with Beganovic, destroying his front wing and with it his chances for a points finish. The top three remained unchanged for the rest of the race, untroubled by two further safety car periods. Paul Aron claimed pole for the second race, and led from the start ahead of Minì, who was overtaken by Beganovic at the start. Aron's lead remained steady, he mastered two safety cars, one mid-race and one close to the end. Beganovic kept close to Aron, but was not able to challenge the leader. Still, his second place together with his win the day before meant he took the championship lead, 15 points ahead of Belov. Sebastián Montoya led the rookie standings.\nThe championship stayed in Italy, visiting Imola next, where Minì won pole for race one. He kept the lead all throughout a disrupted race: first, the race was stopped for Sami Meguetounif, who crashed heavy and had to be taken to hospital. On the restart, Beganovic claimed second place from Mari Boya, while leader Minì was handed a ten-second time penalty for a false start. Two more safety cars and another red flag, this time for Axel Gnos, saw the race to its end, promoting Beganovic to the win and Aron to the podium. Minì bounced back the day after to take another pole position. A safety car start for damp conditions saw him control the start ahead of Tim Tramnitz in second, before the German was passed by Beganovic, and then by Kas Haverkort, who would later lose his podium to Gabriel Bortoleto after a penalty for a technical fault. A sudden thunderstorm caused a three-car crash and a red flag, and Minì controlled the restart to claim the win. Beganovic's championship advantage rose to 38 points from Aron.\nRound three supported the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix, and one qualifying session was held, where Hadrien David and Beganovic claimed pole for the two races. David held the lead in race one, and there were little changes to the order before the red flag was thrown when the track was blocked by Esteban Masson at the Fairmont Hairpin. When the race restarted, passing remained tricky, so Beganovic could do nothing but follow David to the finish to grab his fifth top-two finish in a row. Haverkort came third, having held back Minì all race long. Race two saw the top pair reversed, with Beganovic leading David, before two separate crashes for Roman Bilinski and Macéo Capietto brought out the safety car. There were a few little fights with slight contact further down the field, but almost no passes were made, and the top trio of Beganovic, David and Minì held position until the finish. David's great weekend saw him grab second in the standings, but Beganovic's lead now stood at 55 points over the rest of the field.\nA week later, Paul Ricard hosted the next round, and Beganovic started the first race on pole. He kept Bortoleto behind at the start, before Joshua Dufek crashed and caused a safety car. On the restart, Aron in third managed to pass Bortoleto. The Prema pair gapped the field fighting for the win, and eventually Aron was able to pass his teammate. On the last lap, Bortoleto in third had to relinquish his podium to Belov. Race two saw Minì on pole, surviving another first-lap safety car ahead of Beganovic, who had already passed Bortoleto. The lead group was close together all race, before another safety car neutralised the race, leaving a short dash to the finish. Beganovic pressured the leader, but was not able to make a move, so came second behind Minì and ahead of Haverkort. His run of now eight top-two finishes was brought to an end however, as his car was found to be non-compliant and he was excluded from race two. This initially gifted Aron a podium, but Beganovic's championship lead was still 45 points over Minì. Beganovic's team appealed the decision. After the team won its appeal in front of the Italian Federation's Court of Appeal in October, the Championship Promoter made a further appeal against the Italian Court's ruling, which was finally denied by the FIA International Court of Appeal. Beganovic was thus reinstated to second place. \nThe first half of the season concluded at Zandvoort with Aron winning the first qualifying. He held David back at the start and kept a consistent gap to the Frenchman, before coming under attack in the latter stages of the race. Keith Donegan had an incident in turn two that resulted in a late safety car, but David was not able to make a move on the leader during the restart. Behind the pair, Haverkort held back Minì to complete the podium. David later lost his podium when he was penalized for misuse of the push-to-pass system. Qualifying for race two again saw Aron come out on top. He was once again strong in the race, holding the lead from Beganovic as Minì jumped from fifth to third before a red flag was thrown when Pietro Delli Guanti's car flew over the barrier at Hugenholtzbocht. Through the rest of the race, Minì passed Beganovic for second, but Aron's lead was uncontested. He completed a perfect weekend, his two wins earned him second in the standings and cut Beganovic's lead down to 36 points.\nSecond half.\nNext, the series travelled to the Hungaroring, where Haverkort picked up his maiden pole position in first qualifying. He controlled the start, as Aron in second got overtaken by Minì, before he got pushed off by Dufek and fell down the order. Dufek was then passed himself by Roman Bilinski and Leonardo Fornaroli. This order then settled down and remained the same until the end, earning Haverkort his maiden win in the series. Race two began with David on pole alongside Minì, with the Italian getting overtaken by Bortoleto around turn one, who then tried to pass David for the lead, but failed. This order remained until Joshua Dürksen crashed, bringing out a safety car and setting the field up for a late restart. This was where Minì quickly passed Bortoleto for second before the safety car was called again and the race ended behind it. Beganovic had a rare off-day, qualifying twelfth, then having a troubled race and finishing 16th. This coupled with two second places for Minì meant his lead was slashed to only nine points.\nSpa-Francorchamps played host to round six of the championship, and Beganovic was back on form, taking pole for race one. He held off pressure from Minì in second at the start, and had no pressure from then on. Shortly before the end, Minì had a puncture that ended his race. He would have lost his second place, were it not for a timely red flag called two laps later, with the results declared from lap 12 and Minì in second. Third was Meguetounif, fighting with Aron all race. After the race, Minì was disqualified on technical grounds, promoting Eduardo Barrichello to his maiden podium. Race two saw Aron on pole, before getting passed by David, Bortoleto and Beganovic. David was first over the line, but the stewards judged his pass for the lead to be made under yellow flags, handing him a penalty and thereby giving Bortoleto the win. A win and a podium meant Beganovic could overturn his recent negative trend and grow his points margin to 23 ahead of Minì. The rookie standings were now led by Fornaroli.\nAfter the summer break, racing returned at Spielberg with Aron on pole for race one. Heavy rain disrupted the race start and caused a stoppage. On the restart, many drivers, including the lead group, soon pitted for dry tires. This left Barrichello in the lead, before getting passed by returnee Pierre-Louis Chovet, while Haverkort had moved up from 12th on the grid to second. A safety car was then brought out when Aron and Montoya collided after pitting. While slick tires initially were faster than rain tires, returning rain meant the advantage of the dry tires was gone. On the restart Haverkort and Dufek went past Chovet to finish first and second. The second race also was not very straightforward, disrupted by three safety car periods. David was still able to keep his competition behind, leading from pole until the end and leaving Beganovic and Dufek to fight each other behind, the pair eventually finishing in that same order. Two podiums for Beganovic to none for Minì meant the Swede built up his points gap to 53.\nThe penultimate round of the season was held at Barcelona, and Aron was once again on pole for the first race. He held off Dilano van 't Hoff at the start, who had to defend from Barrichello and David. Over the race, David was able to dispatch third and second place and began closing in on Aron. Through the last three laps, Aron repeatedly came under attack from David, but was able to keep the frenchman behind and win the race. Qualifying for race two saw Bortoleto grab his maiden pole. David started third and was able to get by Chovet straight away, but his attempt to gain the race lead was interrupted by the safety car being called. On the restart, Bortoleto initially gapped David, but the latter managed to close the gap again, with the pair fighting for a few laps until another safety car was called late in the race and the race ended under yellow flag conditions. Beganovic had a mediocre weekend, with only one points finish, so his gap to Minì dropped to 38 points, leaving the championship to be decided at Mugello.\nThe championship decider at Mugello began with Aron on pole for race one and Beganovic needing at least fourth place to seal the title. Aron ran a flawless lights-to-flag race to get maximum points, but was not able to deny Beganovic his championship. The Swede started third and drove with his championship in mind, not attacking Victor Bernier in second all too aggressively. He held on to fourth after Dufek passed him on a late safety car restart, thereby clinching his first single-seater title. Bortoleto was on pole for the final race of the season. Minì started third and had to win with Aron not scoring to secure second in the championship. He dispatched Dufek right at the start and gained the lead after the first third of the race. From then on, he controlled the race, while Aron started 16th and came home pointless, ceding second in the standings to Minì by a single point. Dufek in fourth was on course to win the rookie title, before an error on a safety car restart saw him drop to seventh, giving Fornaroli in eighth the title.\nBeganovic's consistency was the key for his championship, only failing to score points on three occasions, as well as his very strong start to the season that saw him finish in the top two for the first seven races in a row. Minì and Aron both had stretches where they seemed able to close up to Beganovic, but his early advantage meant he led the standings from the first race until the end. In the fight for the rookie title, Montoya had the strongest start, but a run of eight pointless races in the end saw him drop to third. Entry numbers never dropped below 35, showing continually high interest in the championship. The introduction of a push-to-pass system proved to better competition, although still held back somewhat by the heavy Tatuus chassis.\nChampionship standings.\nPoints were awarded to the top 10 classified finishers.\nTeams' standings.\nFor teams entering more than two cars only the two best-finishing cars were eligible to score points in the teams' championship."

They represent Providence College in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 38th season in the Hockey East conference. They are coached by Nate Leaman, in his 11th season, and play their home games at Schneider Arena.\nSeason.\nProvidence began the season well, winning its first three games and headed into the Ice Breaker Tournament ranked in the top 10. Unfortunately, when the Friars faced other highly ranked opponents, they weren't able to sustain the same level of success. They finished last in the tournament but recovered a week later with a win over Denver. They regained their spot in the top-10 and held it until early November when they were swept by defending national champion Massachusetts. The two losses were very harmful to Providence since their record left them with little opportunity for improvement over the next month. The Friars did win the succeeding six games, however, because all of them were to unranked teams (some of whom had terrible records) they actually fell in the rankings, dropping down to 13th by the beginning of December.\nThe team finally got a chance to climb back into postseason contention when they met Northeastern. Unfortunately, just as they had against the Minutemen, Providence dropped both games to the Huskies and fell further down the standings. The Friars performed well in their four other games during the month but none were against ranked teams.\nCOVID-19 ended up causing Providence to cancel a few games at the beginning of January and the team looked out of sorts afterwards. Providence played inconsistently over the second half of the year. While the team did record impressive wins against upper-echelon clubs, the bright spots couldn't cover up the fact that, in a down year for Hockey East, the Friars finished in the bottom half of the standings.\nProvidence entered postseason play with only a slim chance for an at-large bid. The Friars would likely need to make the conference championship game to have any hope at making the tournament but even that would not be a guarantee. They dominated Vermont in the opening match, outshooting the Catamounts 40–18, but only scraped by with a 2–1 victory. The lack of scoring continued in the quarterfinals when they took on Massachusetts. They continued to send a barrage of shots on goal, firing 47 in total, but again could only manage 2 goals. The Minutemen, however, had no trouble getting the puck past Jaxson Stauber and notched 4 on only 19 shots and ended the Friars' season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2021–22 Quinnipiac Bobcats Men's ice hockey season was the 46th season of play for the program. They represented Quinnipiac University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 17th season in the ECAC Hockey conference. The Bobcats were coached by Rand Pecknold, in his 28th season, and played their home games at the People's United Center.\nSeason.\nRegular season.\nQuinnipiac began the season with high hopes of building on their recent success. The biggest question early in the year was how the team would replace the now-departed Keith Petruzzelli in goal. Graduate transfer Dylan St. Cyr was the obvious choice for the Bobcats however, he was injured in the first game of the season. Backup Yaniv Perets, a sophomore who had played just 32 minutes all of the year before, finished the game and then posted his first career shutout in the Ice Breaker Tournament consolation match. St. Cyr returned the following game, earning a shutout of his own, but head coach Rand Pecknold had seen something special with his young goalie. Buoyed by a suffocating defensive system, both goaltenders performed well and led the Bobcats to an enviable record early in the season.\nThough the team was hampered by a weak schedule, that didn't stop Quinnipiac from earning the #2 ranking on the strength of an astounding 14–1–3 record when they paused for their winter break. By that time the team was already the top defensive club in the nation with 8 shutouts shared between their two starters. The start to their second half was delayed by COVID-19 positives but that didn't slow down the Bobcats. The team continued winning and was the top-ranked team in the nation in mid-January. A narrow loss to Cornell dropped Quinnipiac down to #2 but the team responded by winning their next seven games.\nAs the regular season wound down, it was apparent that the team's biggest weakness was its offense. Though they were one of the top scoring teams in ECAC Hockey, the Bobcats' offense had not been consistent during the course of the season. The team went through stretches where they couldn't score with their impenetrable goaltending being the only reason the Bobcats would win. Over the final three weeks of the season, the lack of scoring punch cost Quinnipiac three games against good teams. While the losses didn't harm their NCAA tournament hopes, they did prevent the Bobcats from earning a top seed for the tournament.\nPostseason.\nEven with the subpar end, Quinnipiac earned their second consecutive regular season title. As they entered the postseason, Quinnipiac had already set the record for most shutouts by a team in one season with 16. They had broken the record held by 1999–2000 Niagara (12) with Perets just one behind Greg Gardner for the individual single-season mark. Despite facing rather weak opposition in the quarterfinals, Quinnipiac struggled against St. Lawrence and had to come back from a 2-goal deficit to win the second game in overtime. After downing the Cindarella-hopes of Colgate in the semifinal, Quinnipiac was challenged by a rising Harvard squad who were playing for the season. The Bobcats widely outshot the Crimson, 49–17, but were never able to gain a lead in the match. Harvard's defense held and Perets was unable to stop the winning goal from getting by his glove in overtime.\nAs they entered the NCAA tournament, Quinnipiac received a #2 seed, however, they were set against the defending national runners-up, St. Cloud State. Before the game began, the scales were tilted in the Bobcats' favor due to the opposing starter being unable to play due to pneumonia. As it turned out, the Bobcats needed all the luck they could get. The team played its worst game all season, getting outshot 16–34 with Perets allowing a season-high 4 goals. It was only though the ineffective netminding in the St. Cloud end that Quinnipiac managed to squeak by with a 5–4 victory.\nFor their second game, Quinnipiac knew they were facing a tougher fight in top-seeded Michigan and they would have to play much better if they had any chance at victory. Early on, nothing seemed to go right for the Bobcats. They weren't able to get any traction in the game and found themselves down 0–4 after two periods. Needing to wake his team up, Pecknold replaced Perets with St. Cyr in goal for the start of third and the Bobcats rose to the occasion. Quinnipiac completely took over the game in the final frame, peppering the Wolverine cage with shot after shot until Jayden Lee finally broke through. The score remained unchanged for about five minutes but the assault continued. Around the mid-way point of the period, Quinnipiac netted 2 goals in the span of 2 minutes, cutting the lead to 1 with just under nine minutes to play. With Michigan reeling, it appeared that the Bobcats may have had a shot at upsetting the championship favorites. While the Wolverines shored up their defense, they could not keep the puck away from Quinnipiac and the bobcats attacked relentlessly. Despite the constant threat of scoring, Pecknold pulled St. Cyr for an extra attacker with 4 minutes to play, much earlier than 1-goal deficit typically required. The gambit failed almost immediately as a bad pass in the Michigan zone ended up being skated down the ice into a vacated cage. Two successive goals put the game out of reach and Quinnipiac's season was over.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "Norman Aaron Black (born December 3, 1996) is a Filipino-American professional basketball player for the Meralco Bolts of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). He won the PBA Outstanding Rookie award in 2021. He is the son of former PBA Best Import Norman Black, who is also the former head coach of Meralco.\nCollege career.\nAfter playing in high school for the Ateneo Blue Eaglets, Black committed to the senior team of Ateneo. He didn't play that season as he was a team captain for the Philippine team in the 2014 FIBA Asia U-18 Championship.\nHe made his college debut the next season, scoring 11 points in a win over the Adamson Soaring Falcons. He scored 13 points in 13 minutes to extend Ateneo's win streak to five against the De La Salle Green Archers. His team lost in the semis that season to the FEU Tamaraws.\nWith Season 78 MVP Kiefer Ravena graduating, Black transitioned from role player to one of the Eagles' top players. In their first game of Season 79, he had a game-high 23 points and a win against the UST Growling Tigers. In a game against FEU, he injured his left foot, causing him to sit out for three weeks. He returned in a win against the UE Red Warriors. He scored 16 points to help Ateneo prevent La Salle from sweeping the elimination round. For that performance, he was named Player of the Week. They lost in the Finals to La Salle.\nIn Seasons 80 and 81, Black saw his stats dip under Coach Tab Baldwin, but was still a reliable contributor as Ateneo won back-to-back titles. He forwent his final playing year.\nProfessional career.\nQuezon City Capitals (2019).\nAfter playing for Ateneo, he next played for the Quezon City Capitals in the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League. He tallied 17 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists for a triple-double in a win against the Binan City Laguna Heroes. Black averaged 11.8 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.4 assists in the 14 games that he played for Quezon City.\nAMA Online Education Titans (2019).\nIn 2019, Black played for the AMA Online Education Titans in the semi-professional PBA D-League Foundation Cup. He had 25 points, 15 rebounds, and 11 assists in his debut. In their first win, he registered 26 points, 16 rebounds, and 14 assists, becoming only the third player in that league's history to rack up multiple triple-doubles after Mike Tolomia (twice) and Jeron Teng (thrice). He cooled down slightly as AMA lost to Marinerong Pilipino, with only 12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 assists. He had another triple-double with 45 points, 18 assists, and 12 rebounds as AMA qualified for the quarterfinals. He closed his D-League stint with 22 points as Marinerong Pilipino eliminated them.\nZamboanga Family's Brand Sardines (2019–2020).\nBlack was traded to the Zamboanga Family's Brand Sardines where he became teammates with future Meralco teammate Alvin Pasaol.\nMeralco Bolts (2020–present).\n2020 season: Rookie season.\nIn the 2019 PBA Draft, Black was drafted 18th overall by the Meralco Bolts, who are coached by his father, Norman Black. He became only the third PBA player to be coached by his father as a head coach after Dodot Jaworski with Robert Jaworski and Marc Agustin with Ato Agustin. In the Bolts' first win, he produced 8 points, 2 rebounds and 2 assists, which was better than his losing debut of 6 points, 3 assists, and 2 turnovers. He contributed 16 points on 6-of-10 shooting, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, and a steal in an overtime win against the Magnolia Hotshots. He copped a Rookie of the Week honor as Meralco started the year 3–1. They finished 7–4, qualifying for the playoffs as a 5th seed and playing against the San Miguel Beermen. In Game 1, he dropped 11 of his 14 points in the fourth quarter as Meralco defeated San Miguel, 78–71, and forced a rubber match for a semis seat. This performance gave him another Rookie of the Week award. They clinched a spot in the semifinals with a dominating 90–68 win. In the semis, they lost in 5 games to the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel, with Scottie Thompson preventing Meralco from going to the Finals. He finished the season by winning the Rookie of the Year Award, becoming the lowest draft pick to do so. He was also named to the All-Rookie Team.\n2021 season: First Finals appearance.\nIn a 2021 Philippine Cup win against the Beermen, Black scored 14 points. He injured his hand during a game against the Terrafirma Dyip. He was cleared to return nearly a month later during the playoffs. Meralco got to the semifinals in that conference, where they were eliminated by Magnolia. In a 2021 Governors' Cup win over the NLEX Road Warriors, he scored 19 points. They faced Magnolia once again in the semis where in Game 1, he had 14 points, six rebounds, and four assists to contribute in the win. In Game 5, he stepped up for the injured Chris Banchero with 16 points as they got past Magnolia and reached the Finals against Ginebra. In his Finals debut, he scored 12 points as Meralco won first. He then followed it up with 24 points, but Ginebra took the win to even the series 1–1. In Game 5, he got a season-high 25 points, but Ginebra won that game and the next, making them the Governors' Cup champions.\n2022–23 season.\nOn May 24, 2022, Black signed a two-year extension with the team. To start the 2022–23 season, he scored 19 points in a win over the Phoenix Super LPG Fuel Masters. He then followed it up by tying his career-high of 25 points in a win over the Converge FiberXers. He missed the next game due to a wrist sprain. Against the NorthPort Batang Pier, he made his return and put up 20 points, five rebounds, and seven assists to lead Meralco to the win. In a win over the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters, he scored 20 points including a clutch triple with 35.6 seconds left. They ended the 2022 Philippine Cup with a record of 7–4, good for the fifth seed. In Game 1 of their quarterfinals series against Ginebra, he led the way with 25 points as they won. With a win the following game, Meralco was finally able to get past Ginebra in a series. In Game 4 of their semis against the Beermen, he led with 21 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists to tie the series. Then in Game 6, he scored 11 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter and also grabbed five rebounds and six assists to force a do-or-die game. However, they lost Game 7, and were eliminated from title contention.\nMeralco then started the Commissioner's Cup with back-to-back losses, but finally got their first win of the conference against Terrafirma in which he had 17 points. In a game against Rain or Shine, Black was accidentally elbowed in the nose by Rey Nambatac and had to be taken to the hospital. In a win over the TNT Tropang Giga, he had a double-double of 17 points and 11 rebounds, along with six assists, a steal, and a block. Meralco didn't qualify for the playoffs that conference.\nBlack missed some games during the Governors' Cup due to a knee injury. In a win over the Blackwater Bossing, he contributed 19 points, three rebounds, and seven assists. He then had 21 points and eight rebounds in a loss to TNT.

        "text": "The 2021–22 UConn Huskies men's ice hockey season was the 62nd season of play for the program, the 24th at the Division I level, and the 8th season in the Hockey East conference. The Huskies represented the University of Connecticut and were coached by Mike Cavanaugh, in his 9th season.\nThis was expected to be UConn's final season playing home games at the XL Center in downtown Hartford, Connecticut. In May, 2021, UConn began construction on a new 2,600-seat arena on its Storrs campus that will be home to both the Huskies men's and women's hockey programs upon its opening, planned for the 2022–23 season.\nSeason.\nUConn entered the season looking to post their first winning record since 2013. Though they had been trending upwards in recent years, the Huskies were still picked to finish in the middle of the standings. The biggest question early was which goaltender would take over for the departed Tomáš Vomáčka. Graduate Darion Hanson, who had transferred to UConn the year before, won the job and held the position for the duration of the season. Hanson proved to be a stabilizing force in goal, and kept Connecticut in contention for most of the season.\nThe biggest impediment to the Huskies was the poor non-conference record for their entire conference which downgraded the team's overall strength of schedule. While UConn won most of their games against unranked opponents, a middling record against ranked teams did the Huskies no favors and the team was a long shot to make the tournament at the end of January. A 4-game winning streak in February briefly put the team in the top-20, but the Huskies followed that by losing four out of five games near the end of the regular season.\nThough UConn was guaranteed to finish with a winning record at the beginning of the playoff, they also knew that they had no chance to make the NCAA tournament without a conference championship. Hanson played masterfully in the quarterfinal game, stopping 38 shots from Boston University. In the semifinal the offense took over and triumphed over top-seeded Northeastern. Suddenly, the Huskies found themselves just 1 win away from the program's first NCAA tournament appearance. All they had to do now was defeat the defending national champions, Massachusetts. Hanson was again a brick wall in goal, turning aside all but one shot in regulation. The rest of the team, however, was outplayed by the Minutemen and could only hold on to force overtime. UMass ended the game on their first shot of overtime and ended the Huskies' season.\nDespite the sour end, UConn recorded 20 wins for the first time in 24 years. Combined with their strong performances against the top teams in their conference, this was objectively the best season in the history of the program.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "Gerald Carr (American football)",
        "text": "Gerald N. Carr (born June 28, 1959) is a former American football quarterback and coach. He played college football at Southern Illinois before starting a coaching career that spanned from 1981–2012 with North Mecklenburg High School, Southern Illinois, Davidson, Akron, Washington State, Arizona, North Carolina, the Philadelphia Eagles, Wake Forest, the Carolina Cobras, Indiana, Kentucky, Baylor, Buffalo, Southern, and the Virginia Destroyers.\nEarly life and education.\nCarr was born on June 28, 1959, in Davidson, North Carolina. He went to high school in Huntersville, North Carolina, at North Mecklenburg. He was offered a full scholarship from Southern Illinois University following high school. After his first season, Carr left the school's football team upon his family's request. He rejoined the team early in the 1978 season following an injury to starting quarterback John Cernak. In the team's final practice game before the season, Carr completed 11 of 18 passes for 154 yards and two touchdowns. After starting a few games, he was replaced by Arthur Williams. \nHe did not play much again until October 1979, when he came off the bench and lead the Illinois to a 31–7 victory over Wichita State. His teammate Joe Barwinski said Carr \"was tearing Wichita State apart\". The \"Southern Illinoisan\" reported, \"Every time Wichita State penetrated the Salukis' pass protection and closed in on Carr, off he'd go, darting and dancing away from would-be tacklers. The whole scene, hilarious at times, was reminiscent of the old \"Roadrunner\" shows, where the coyote gets foiled every time.\" Carr was the team captain in his senior year, 1980. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science. \nCoaching career.\nRather than pursue a career in professional football, Carr returned home to Huntersville and became a coach at North Mecklenburg High School, serving as assistant football coach and head coach of the JV baseball team. Under his coaching, the JV baseball team compiled a 16–1 record in the season. He also was a substitute teacher in Mecklenburg's school program.\nAfterwards he returned to Southern Illinois University, and served as a graduate assistant during the 1982 season while working towards a master's degree. In 1983, Carr was hired by the Davidson Wildcats to be their offensive backfield coach. He was the team's receivers coach and academic coordinator from 1984–1985.\nIn 1986, he was given a position by the Akron Zips college football team. He would coach from 1986–1988 at Akron, serving as academic coordinator, quarterbacks coach, receivers coach, and tight ends coach during his three seasons with the school. Carr left Akron and was hired as the receivers coach of Washington State in 1989.\nOn January 10, 1991, Arizona Wildcats football coach Dick Tomey announced he had signed Carr to be the Wildcats' quarterbacks coach. Tomey said, \"Gerald will give us some ability to be more explosive in our passing offense, because he came from an explosive offense at WSU.\" The Wildcats compiled a 4–7 record in the 1991 season.\nCarr left Arizona after one season, and joined the North Carolina Tar Heels in the same position. He spent three seasons, from 1992–1994, with the Tar Heels, helping them achieve a 10–3 record in 1993.\nAfter three seasons, he joined the professional Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He was given the position of wide receivers coach, and was hired in February 1995 by Ray Rhodes. After his first season, the Eagles acquired Irving Fryar, who he coached to Pro Bowl seasons in 1996 and 1997. Fryar set the franchise record for single-season receptions in 1996. Carr was fired following the 1998 season. \nAfter his departure from the Eagles, Carr was given a position as the receivers coach for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team. He left after one season to join the Carolina Cobras of the Arena Football League (AFL). He served as the team's offensive coordinator, quarterbacks coach, and wide receivers coach during 2000. He joined the Indiana Hoosiers following the season, and served as their passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach.\nOn February 11, 2002, Carr joined the Kentucky Wildcats to be their running backs coach. Guy Morriss gave him the task of assistant coach before the season started. Morriss said, \"Gerald has earned the respect of the players already in the short time he has been here. I like the way he has handled the players very demanding, but fair. He's also proven that he is a good, knowledgeable coach.\"\nCarr spent one season at Kentucky before spending 2003–2005 at Baylor University. He served as the school's assistant head coach and running backs coach. He resigned in December 2005. He was replaced by Wes Phillips. In 2006, he was announced as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the Buffalo Bulls. He left Buffalo in January 2007.\nHe was retired until 2011, when he accepted an offer to be the Southern Jaguars' offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. He left before the season began to join the Virginia Destroyers of the United Football League (UFL). He spent two seasons as their running backs coach, winning the 2011 UFL Championship Game before retiring from coaching. Running back Dominic Rhodes won UFL player of the year in 2011.\nLater life.\nAfter Carr's coaching career he founded a construction company called All-Pro Builders."

        "text": "The Vancouver bid for the 2030 Winter Olympics was a proposed bid to bring the 2030 Winter Olympics to the province of British Columbia in Canada, with Vancouver and Whistler were expected to serve as the main host cities. Vancouver and Whistler previously hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 Winter Paralympics, while Canada also hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, the 1976 Summer Paralympics in Toronto and the 1988 Winter Olympics with Calgary as main host, along another venues in the province of Alberta.\nIn May 2014, with many potential candidates withdrawing their bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics due to several motives, the idea for Vancouver to host the Olympics again began floating around. At that time, Stockholm and Kraków already withdrew their bids, along with Munich and St. Moritz who got negative referendums for their candidacies. Given Lviv's candidacy to be eliminated due to the Ukrainian political crisis, this meant Oslo would have been considered the frontrunner. However, on 1 October, Oslo also withdrew. This raised questions about whether Almaty or Beijing could be selected to host the 2022 Winter Olympics; Beijing was ultimately selected. Due to the troubled bidding process, some specialists wondered about the possibility of a recent host such as Vancouver or Salt Lake City could be invited directly to host the games. A similar situation occurred in 1976, when Innsbruck, the host of 1964 Winter Olympics, replaced Denver as host of the 1976 Winter Olympics.\nIn October 2021, it was revealed that 43% of people in British Columbia supported the bid, a considerable drop from 60% a year earlier.\nAnother poll by Leger and Leger conducted in December 2021 showed that more than 65% of British Columbians were supportive or neutral about the candidature. 62% supported the bid that won the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nIn February 2022, the Canadian Olympic Committee and its Paralympic counterpart signed an agreement with the cities of Vancouver and Whistler, as well as several B.C. First Nations organizations, to explore the feasibility of a bid for 2030. The bid group's current goal is to host the games in B.C., without reference to a primary host city at this time, under the interim name \"B.C. 2030\". The COC has also disavowed any relationship with an unofficial \"Vancouver 2030\" organization, which had been reported in some media as being the official bid committee.\nMore detailed plans were revealed in June 2022; about 85% to 95% of the existing venues from the 2010 games would be reused, but with some small changes such as the creation of a cluster in Hastings Park that would encompass the Pacific Coliseum, the PNE Agrodome (which would host the curling in place of the Hillcrest Centre, which in 2011 turned a community center) and provisory infrastructures for the Big Air. Another changes is about the no use of Cypress Mountain (due environmental issues), whose events would be moved to the Sun Peaks Resort in Kamloops and the use of BC Place, that will be an exclusive venue to the opening and closing ceremonies. A new and provisory Medals Plaza is planned to be at the Hastings Park. This venue is planned to host the Paralympics Closing Ceremonies in place of Whistler Medal Plaza. Three or four New Olympic Villages would be constructed on First Nations-owned lands and after the Games will turn a low-cost and quality housing for these communities and they will be built with the goal of a 'climate-positive' outcome - leaving the natural environment in a better state than before the Games.\nIn October 2022, the BC Government decided to not support the bid, citing high costs. The bid is over according to Chief Jen Thomas of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation."

        "text": "The 2021–22 St. Lawrence Saints Men's ice hockey season was the 82nd season of play for the program and the 61st season in the ECAC Hockey conference. The Saints represented the St. Lawrence University and were coached by Brent Brekke, in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nAfter a stunning conference championship in 2021, St. Lawrence was hoping to continue the upwards swing but the team got off to a rotten start. Emil Zetterquist was a tower of strength in goal, holding opponents to an average of 2 goals a game in his first eight starts, but the team's offense was pitiful. Over the first month and a half of their season, the Saints scored more than 2 goals just once and ended up with twice as many ties as they had wins. The lack of scoring was a trend that continued throughout the entire season and prevented the Larries from being able to make any waves in their conference. On the other side of the puck, St. Lawrence's stable defense went through a rough patch in the middle of the season and their average goals allowed ballooned to more than double what it had been at the start.\nIn late January, the Saints finally recovered on the back end and gave Zetterquist the help he needed. In their final eleven games, St. Lawrence played .500 hockey, which enabled them to finish 8th in the conference and receive a home site for the First Round of the conference tournament.\nThe series against Brown pitted two fairly remedial offenses against one another but that did not prevent some drama from being created. After a solid win in the first game, St. Lawrence dropped the second in overtime. A deciding third match was required and the Bears, who averaged just over one and a half goals a game, built a 3–1 lead midway through the game. The Saints came storming back, however, and tied the score with less than 10 minutes to play. The pivotal game required overtime as well with every shot potentially ending someone's season. As it turned out, St. Lawrence only needed one chance because the first shot on goal in the extra session found its way into the net and the Saints advanced to the quarterfinals.\nSince every higher-seed won in the opening round, St. Lawrence was set against top-seeded Quinnipiac in the second round. The Tournament-bound Bobcats had been a powerhouse in conference all season and looked like they were ready to trounce the Saints after a routine win in the first game. However, the Larries would not just lay down and the team fought back in the second match. The Saints scored twice early in the third period, taking a 3–1 edge and potentially setting up a third meeting. Quinnipiac rallied to tie the score but couldn't knock out St. Lawrence before the buzzer, forcing overtime. In the extra period, neither offense was particularly strong, with just 10 shots being recorded between the two, but it was the Larries who had more chances on goal. That trend continued in the second overtime and, as their shot total increased, it seemed like only a matter of time before the Saints broke through. Unfortunately, the team ran out of time in the 89th minute of play and St. Lawrence's valiant effort ended in defeat.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Tommies represented the University of St. Thomas (Minnesota) and were coached by Enrico Blasi, in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nSt. Thomas began its first season at the Division I level knowing that it wasn't expected to compete with many of its new opponents. While the roster was full of transfers from other D-I programs, few had been high-level players. The Tommies began their season with a bad if unsurprising 2–12 loss to the defending national runner-up, St. Cloud State. The second game, however, was much better; even though it was a loss, it was a much closer affair and demonstrated that St. Thomas could at least rise to the level of play.\nWhile the Tommies started the season 0–7, there were a few close games and the team finally broke through with its first D-I win in late October. After the victory, the St. Thomas offense went dormant for several months, scoring more than 2 goals on just one occasion until mid-January. The 15-game losing streak that resulted made it very difficult for St. Thomas to do anything but finish last in the CCHA standings.\nThe scoring picked up slightly in the later part of the season, and the Tommies were able to get two more wins before the season was out, but it was hardly a shock when St. Thomas was ranked as the worst team at the Division I level by season's end.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Dutchmen represented Union College and played their home games at Achilles Center, and were coached by Rick Bennett, in his 10th season.\nSeason.\nAfter losing the entirety of their previous season to the COVID-19 pandemic, Union got a slow start to their season. Neither the offense nor the defense were effective during the first month of the season but, once November rolled around, the Dutchmen began to show some promise. Inconsistent play had the team floating in the middle of the ECAC Hockey standings and by the winter break the team well out of the running for the NCAA tournament.\nOn January 19, the Union administration received an allegation regarding the conduct of head coach Rick Bennett. He was placed on paid administrative leave the following day when an investigation began and assistant coach John Ronan took over day-to-day responsibilities. Nine days later, after the investigation confirmed the allegation about 'coaching style and practices', Bennett resigned from his position. At the same time, Ronan was confirmed as the interim head coach and would remain in that position until at least the end of the season.\nThere was a brief uptick in the team's play during the transition but the team flagged in February, slipping down into the bottom third of the conference. Union managed to win its final two regular season games which pushed the team up to 7th and enabled the club to have a home date for the first round of the conference tournament.\nThe strong play that had suddenly appeared at the end continued into the postseason and Union was dominant in their two wins over Princeton. The team appeared to have turned a corner under Ronan and gave Clarkson everything they had. Against the second-seeded Golden Knights, Murphy was under a wither barrage of shots but he kept his team in both games, allowing the Dutchmen to tie the score on four separate occasions and push both matches into overtime. While the Dutchmen didn't have the firepower to win either contest, the team acquitted themselves well after a very trying campaign.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Sharks represented Long Island University and were coached by Brett Riley, in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic curtailed the program's first season, LIU was able to pay its first full campaign in 2022. Partly due to the recent addition of the team to the Division I ranks, Long Island scheduled several games against Division II teams during the season. While none of these games helped the Sharks in improving their standing (only games against D-I teams are included in PairWise rankings), they won each match comfortably. Against their contemporaries, the Sharks were less successful but the team did show some flashes of potential throughout the year.\nDuring the first half of the season, LIU played 14 games against D-I opponents and the team won once against lowly Miami. While this was hardly surprising as the team was just two years old, the Sharks compounded their difficulty by scheduling many ranked opponents, several of whom would make the NCAA tournament. The schedule didn't get much easier in the second half but LIU was able to earn a season split with fellow independent Alaska to give some heft to their win total.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Lakers represented Lake Superior State University and were coached by Damon Whitten, in his 8th season.\nSeason.\nLake Superior State joined with six other members of the WCHA to restart the CCHA for the 2021–22 season.\nThe Lakers were hoping to build upon their first NCAA tournament appearance in 25 years with a strong performance. Unfortunately, they lost three critical games in the first two weeks. While they went undefeated in their succeeding seven games, the strength of their opponents kept them out of the polls. A bad stretch in November also cost Lake State and put the Lakers on the wrong side of .500.\nThe defense looked like it had recovered during a weekend split with top-ranked Minnesota State but then the offense flagged the following week against lowly Ferris State. The team went up and down in their play for several months but began to show a bit more consistency towards the end of the season. However, despite the improvement, Lake Superior was too far down the PairWise rankings to make the tournament without a conference championship.\nLake Superior began postseason play at home against Northern Michigan and laid an egg in the first game. The Lakers allowed the first five goals of the game and were only able to score with less than 5 minutes to play. They were much better in the rematch, winning 3–2 to tie the series and force a deciding rubber match. After surrendering the first goal, the Lakers reeled off three in a row to build a 3–1 lead early in the second period. Northern Michigan replied with a deluge of goals, scoring four times in the span of 8 minutes to take a commanding lead. Lake State was unable to add to their total for most of the third and were forced to pull Ethan Langenegger in desperation. The ploy worked once but the Wildcats managed to stop a tying goal from being scored and the Lakers' season was over.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Initially formed in Pruszcz Gdański the club enjoyed some success in the higher levels of Polish rugby in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 2000 the club has been based in Gdańsk and has been linked with AZS-AWFiS Gdańsk, the sporting section of the Academy of Physical Education and Sport Jędrzej Śniadeckiego in Gdańsk.\nHistory.\nFormed in 1988, the club was initially known as Lotnik Pruszcz Gdański and served as Lechia Gdańsk's affiliate team, due to Lechia being a strong team in the Polish leagues and an affiliate team provided playing time for younger or fringe players. Lotnik made their II liga debut in 1992 and continued to play in this league until dropping back to the third tier for the 1996 season. The club immediately returned to the second tier, then known as \"Seria B\", and won the league securing promotion to Poland's top division. In 1998, along with the club's promotion the team's name changed, becoming Dębica Lincer Pruszcz Gdański. During the club's early years in the top flight the team steadily rose up the league table and becoming a more competitive club. Dębica Lincer enjoyed its greatest success in the 1999–2000 season, when the club finished third in the league and won the Polish Cup. It was after this season the club moved to Gdańsk and joined the AZS-AWFiS Gdańsk sports club, initially using the name AZS AWF Dębica Lincer Gdańsk. The team eventually became generally known as AZS-AWFiS Gdańsk due to its links with the sports club. AZS-AWFiS continued to play in the top division until 2005 when the team suffered relegation to the II liga. After failing to secure an immediate return to the top division the rugby club's operations were temporarily suspended and the team was removed from the leagues.\nAZS-AWFiS have not fielded a rugby union side since 2006, but have continued to field a rugby sevens team which first started competing in 2008. The rugby sevens team's greatest current success is a 4th place overall finish in the Polska Liga Rugby 7 tournament in 2011.\nHonours.\nEkstraliga\nI liga \nPolish Cup"

Despite returning almost off the players from the previous season, the offense was unable to coalesce and proved to be a hindrance for the Black Bears' success. Maine was shutout seven times during the season and finished as one of the lowest goal for in the nation. Compounding their problems was a less-than-stellar performance in goal. Victor Östman and Matthew Thiessen split the starting job but both were fairly inconsistent.\nMaine's start doomed their postseason hopes and by mid-December the Black Bears had just 1 win in 16 games. They played better in the second half, Nearly quadrupling their win total, and took games from Massachusetts and Boston University, both ranked teams. Unfortunately, Maine could never put together a string of good play and ended the year with the worst record in Hockey East. In their only playoff match, the Bears were soundly beaten by Merrimack.

In 1972, he earned a Masters in Education from Queen's University Belfast, and subsequently completed his Ph.D. in the same institution in 1981, with a thesis on \"A consideration of the growth of the concept of the community school, with particular reference to its development since 1930 in Great Britain and the United States of America.\".\nSporting career.\nAt the age of twenty, Wilkinson started playing senior interprovincial badminton. Despite being from Ulster, he was eligible to play for Leinster by virtue of the fact he was a student in Trinity College Dublin. Footage from 1960 of a doubles match Wilkinson played in against Ulster survives in the Irish Film Institute archive. That year Wilkinson was first called up to the Ireland national badminton team as a men's doubles player in a Thomas Cup match against Denmark.\nThe 1960's saw Wilkinson dominate the men's doubles and mixed doubles national titles, with a sole men's single title included for good measure. Beginning in December 1961, Wilkinson succeeded in the men's singles of the Irish National Badminton Championships. The semi-finals of that tournament saw him paired against James 'Chick' Doyle, the reigning men's single champion unbeaten since 1953. Wilkinson received a walkover as Doyle withdrew. The final saw Wilkinson overcome Lennox Robinson in two sets.\nCoaching roles and later life.\nIn the 1980's Wilkinson was an Irish team coach and a senior coach with the Badminton Union of Ireland. Wilkinson died in 2014 in Spain."

        "text": "The 2021–22 UMass Minutemen ice hockey season was the 90th season of play for the program. They represented the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 28th season in the Hockey East conference. The Minutemen were coached by Greg Carvel, in his sixth season, and played their home games at Mullins Center.\nSeason.\nFresh off of the program's first national championship, Massachusetts would have to overcome a sizable loss of talent if they wanted a repeat performance. While the team still possessed many returning players, including tournament MOP Bobby Trivigno, several players had left early for professional careers after outstanding seasons. While the team lost Filip Lindberg, Matt Murray had shared the starting role in net so the team was not without an experienced and proven goaltender. However, the losses were felt in the opening weekend when the Minutemen were swept by Minnesota State at home.\nThe team performed better over the succeeding month and won each of their next six games but then played poorly in the middle of November and saw their ranking sink down into the mid-teens. UMass suffered from Hockey East's poor performance in non-conference games. This meant that victories against their conference rivals, even ranked opponents, would not help their postseason hopes as much as it would in other years. For the remainder of the season, Massachusetts would hover around #10 in the national rankings as they weren't able to put together any extended winning streaks. Throughout the team's up and down play, Trivigno was the leading light offensively. Not only did he finish 16 points better than any other Minuteman but he ended up tied for third in the national scoring race.\nEntering the final week of the regular season, UMass had a 5-point lead in the conference standings and needed just one point to guarantee itself a share of the Hockey East title. Instead, the Minutemen lost both games to Boston College by 1-goal margins while Northeastern swept its weekend finale to surge past Massachusetts. Aside from the stunning result, the losses forced UMass to play Providence in the quarterfinals. The Minutemen were badly outshot by the Friars in the match, 19–47, but Matt Murray stood tall and held the fort while the offense made the most of its sparse opportunities. They were again outshot in the semifinal, though that time only by 4, and managed to knock off Massachusetts Lowell behind Trivigno's second game-winner of the postseason.\nBefore the championship game, UMass knew they were mathematically guaranteed to receive a bid to the NCAA tournament but they weren't going to let that slow them down. Trivigno tied the game just past the midway point and, though he didn't net the winner, he assisted on the final goal that sealed their second consecutive Hockey East Championship.\nDespite riding high after a conference victory, UMass could still only garner a #3 seed for the national tournament. This forced the team into an underdog role against one of the tournament favorites, Minnesota. The Minutemen got off to a decent start and then netted two quick goals in the later half of the first. The Gophers added their own before the period was out but UMass rebuilt its 2-goal advantage early in the second. After that, however, Minnesota slowly chipped away at Massachusetts' lead and ended up tying the game on the power play late in the third. Once overtime began, both teams looked to end things quickly. Unfortunately for the Minutemen, it was Ben Meyers, captain of the Gophers, who scored the final goal and ended the Minutemen's season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "2021–22 North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2021–22 North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's ice hockey season was the 81st season of play for the program. They represented the University of North Dakota in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 9th season in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). The Fighting Hawks were coached by Brad Berry, in his seventh season, and played their home games at Ralph Engelstad Arena.\nSeason.\nNorth Dakota's lineup saw a great deal of change with 14 of the team's 26 players in their first year with the program. While several were transfers from other schools, head coach Brad Berry had his work cut out for him in getting the team to work together. Despite the turnover, UND was still seen as having a good chance at the title and was ranked in the top-10 in the preseason polls. However, the Hawks struggled with consistency early in the season and only possessed a middling record after the first month of the campaign. Once the team got into its conference schedule, they began playing much better and rose to the top of the NCHC.\nWhen they returned after the winter break, North Dakota was in the top-5 in both polls but the offense sputtered. UND lost four games in a row, all to ranked teams, and began sinking in both the rankings and the standings. They recovered at the end of January and then had a tremendous month by winning seven out of eight games in February. The extended winning streak put them back atop the conference standings and had the Hawks set up for a 1st-place finish. Unfortunately, losing to Omaha in the final game of the regular season put UND into a tie with Denver and, because the Pioneers possessed the tie-breaker, meant that North Dakota received the #2 seed for the NCHC tournament.\nThe entire second half of the Hawks season was dominated by the status of Jake Sanderson, the team's top prospect. He wasn't able to play a single game after January 29 due to joining Team USA at the 2022 Winter Olympics. During the competition, He came down with COVID-19, forcing him to miss the first game, and was then injured during the preliminary round. He remained out of the Fighting Hawks lineup for the rest of the regular season before returning for the team's quarterfinal match against Colorado College.\nSanderson opened the scoring on his return, however, in spite of the boost his reappearance provided, the Hawks did not play well against the Tigers. North Dakota had almost three times as many wins as CC during the season but they got a huge fight from their opponents. UND only managed to score twice in each of the two games and it was only through the heroics of Zach Driscoll in goal that they managed to squeeze through into the semifinals. To make matters worse, Sanderson was injured while blocking a shot in the second match and ended up needing wrist surgery to repair the damage. While the team had demonstrated an ability to win without the big defenseman, they weren't able to replicate that effort in the semifinal and fell to Western Michigan.\nNCAA tournament.\nThough the loss was disappointing, North Dakota was already guaranteed a bid for the NCAA tournament and received a #2 seed, one of five NCHC teams in the field. They opened against Notre Dame, a team that played an almost identical style of defensive hockey. The match lived up to predictions as a slow, methodical game with few scoring attempts and solid goaltending. Brent Johnson scored near the end of the first period to give UND the lead but their advantage lasted less than 3 minutes before ND evened the match. Near the end of regulation, when it appeared that the game was heading into overtime, Notre Dame got the puck deep into the Hawks' end before passing it out to an open man in the slot and scored with less than a second to play. While the Irish celebrated, however, the referees reviewed the play and found a discrepancy in the time. The broadcast clock and the official game clock were not in synch and the file was reviewed to determine which was correct. After a long process, it was determined that the game had ended moments before the puck entered the goal and the Hawks were saved from defeat.\nUND began the extra session on the power play, however, a gaff at the blueline forced Chris Jandric to take a penalty to stop a Notre Dame breakaway. After the ensuing 4-on-4 finished, The Irish got an abbreviated man-advantage and made no mistake, potting the winner and ending North Dakota's season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2021–22 Northeastern Huskies Men's ice hockey season was the 90th season of play for the program. They represented Northeastern University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 38th season in the Hockey East conference. The Huskies were coached by Jerry Keefe, in his first season, and played their home games at Matthews Arena.\nSeason.\nIn the offseason, Northeaster reshuffled its athletic department with former hockey head coach Jim Madigan being promoted to Athletic Director and former assistant Jerry Keefe taking his place at the helm of the program. The biggest addition to the team, however, was new starting goaltender Devon Levi. Levi had sat out the previous season on account of COVID-19 but remained enrolled throughout his freshman year. He kicked off his college career with a pair of shutouts and quickly acclimated to the pace of play and volume of shots.\nAfter a bit of a fitful start, Levi settled down and produced a tremendous stretch of goaltending. Over the course of fourteen games beginning in late-October and continuing until early-January, Levi didn't allow more than two goals in any match. Northeastern went 12–1–1 in that time with Levi racking up 5 shutouts and posting a mind-boggling .969 save percentage. The Huskies defense wasn't particularly porous, allowing fewer than 28 shots against in those games, but Levi's astounding performance had him chasing history for the all-time record.\nUnfortunately, Northeastern wasn't playing nearly as well on the other end of the ice. The Huskies were relatively weak in the goal-scoring department with the exception of Aidan Mcdonough. The team ended up relying on the junior winger for more than a quarter of its goals and was hard pressed to put together much in the way of offense when he was off the ice.\nIn February 2021, both the men's and women's programs were selected to participate in the 2021 Winter Universiade. Concerns about COVID-19 caused postponements to be announced in August but new dates were set by November. By the end of the month, however, fears over the Omicron variant forced the Swiss government to introduce new travel restrictions which forced the cancellation of the games.\nDespite the scoring woes, Northeastern was in a prime position to make the NCAA tournament when the second half of the season began. However, after a couple of easy tilts against Long Island, Levi's performance began to break down. In a 4-game stretch, he allowed 15 goals and put the team precarious close to dropping below the cutoff line for the NCAA tournament. To make matters worse for the Huskies, Levi departed afterwards to join Team Canada at the 2022 Winter Olympics. His replacement, T. J. Semptimphelter, was a true freshman that had yet to play a single minute of college hockey and he was thrown in against #14 Massachusetts Lowell. Semptimphelter responded with an admirable, although losing, performance and then produced several solid games over the next four weeks.\nUpon Levi's return in late-February, Northeastern had improved its position during his absence. Although the team lost in the Beanpot final, the Huskies were ranked in the top-15 and had an outside chance at a conference title. Levi announced his return with a 60-save victory over Connecticut and followed that up with a 40-save performance the following night. After a stunning loss to lowly Vermont, the team needed quite a bit of help as it was 5 points behind Massachusetts for 1st-place. In a stunning turn of events, the Minutemen lost both games on the final weekend of the regular season in regulation while Northeastern shut down Merrimack to vault to top of the standings and capture the program's first ever league title.\nPostseason.\nWhen the Huskies began postseason play they did so knowing that the only guarantee of making the NCAA tournament was a conference championship. With anything less, they would have to hope that other conferences would not be won by underdog teams. Boston College was the first opponent for Northeastern and everything seemed to be going their way in the first two periods. NU entered the final frame with a 3–0 lead and was ready to cruise to an easy victory but the Eagles had other ideas. BC's offense went on the attack and fired 25 shots on goal in the last 20 minutes, getting two goals in just over 16 minutes, but the defense was able to hold over the last 3:48 and prevent Boston College from forcing overtime. The narrow victory was a portent of things to come, however, and the team was again widely outshot in the semifinal. Connecticut's defense was ready for the Huskies and limited Northeastern to a single goal, knocking NU out with a 1–4 loss. The defeat put Northeastern on the brink of disaster since the team was dropped down to #14 in the Pairwise rankings. That meant that the Huskies would miss out on the tournament if more than one lower-seeded teams won their conference championship games. After Harvard won the ECAC Hockey crown, the Huskies were put on the chopping block. Both the Hockey East and CCHA title games went into overtime but, fortunately for Northeastern, both were won by higher-seeded teams and the Huskies ended up receiving the last at-large bid into the tournament.\nNortheastern was set opposite Western Michigan, one of the top offenses in the nation. With their work cut out for them, the 4th-seeded Huskies came out skating hard and tried to outplay the Broncos. Both teams raced up and down the ice for most of the game and though WMU got an early lead, Levi made sure they weren't able to build on it. Northeastern seemed to grow stronger as the match wore on and fired more and more pucks on goal. With less than 4 minutes remaining in the game, Mcdonough finally broke through with his 25th goal of the year, tying the score. Less than 90 seconds into overtime, Levi made a poor clearing attempt from behind his net. The puck was knocked down by a Bronco who then skated around the cage and tried to score on an empty net. Levi raced to get back into position and initially it appeared that he was just able to stop the goal. However, replay showed that the puck had completely crossed the goal line prior to his diving attempt and the game went to Western Michigan.\nLevi ended up finishing the season just .004 below the all-time record for save percentage in a single season. However, because he played in at least 30 games during the season, Levi broke the record for career save percentage with .952. Retaining the record will depend on his performance in future seasons.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Being able to throw and catch with both hands was unheard of until then, and he also developed a back-hand shot which made for greater depth in play.\nIn 1970 he was a member of the Australian team to play against the touring US team and in 1972, toured the US again. American experts described Griffin as the best player in the world, and he was recognised by the US Lacrosse Hall of Fame, Baltimore, following that 1972 tour.\nIn 1974, he competed in the World Championship in Melbourne and in 1984, was assistant Australian coach for the tournament that was played alongside the 1984 Summer Olympics.\nIn 1986 Brian was inducted into the Western Australian Hall of Champions and in 1999 was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame."

The Falcons represented Bowling Green State University and were led by third-year head coach Ty Eigner.\nSeason.\nBowling Green joined with six other members of the WCHA to restart the CCHA for the 2021–22 season. Before the CCHA resumed play, an eighth member, former NCAA Division III member St. Thomas, joined the league.\nAfter narrowly missing out on the NCAA tournament the year before, Bowling Green got a good start to the season, going undefeated through their first five games. The Falcons ran into a bit of trouble when they started playing ranked teams, losing 7 consecutive games against top-20 opponents. The losses didn't put Bowling Green in good standing with the rankings and the Falcons remained unlikely to earn a berth despite getting up to a 13–9–3 record.\nIn the last nine games, however, the team's offense all but vanished and the Falcons went 1–8 to end the regular season. Despite all the momentum moving against them, Bowling Green managed to win the first game in the playoff series against Bemidji State. Unfortunately, they weren't able to repeat the performance and their season ended on a down note.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2021–22 Brown Bears Men's ice hockey season was the 104th season of play for the program and the 60th in the ECAC Hockey conference. The Bears represented Brown University and were coached by Brendan Whittet, in his 12th season.\nSeason.\nBrown's return to the ice after losing the entire 20–21 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic began well with Luke Kania posting a shutout in the opening match. Afterwards, the Bears took a sharp turn downwards and lost seven straight games. In the stretch neither Kania nor freshman Mathieu Caron played particularly well but the later did perform better overall so the team began to lean more towards Caron as the starter. The biggest problem for Brown was their woeful offense that was shutout in three of those games and would remain inadequate for the remainder of the season.\nIn early December, Brown finally ended its losing streak when Caron posted back-to-back shutouts with the first coming in surprise fashion against Harvard, a team that would eventually make the NCAA tournament. The short winning streak ended shortly thereafter and the team tried to turn back to Kania but the results were very poor.\nAn uptick in the number of positive COVID-19 tests in January caused several of Brown's games to be postponed. When they finally got back onto the ice later in the month, Brendan Whittet had settled on Caron as the team's starter and he kept the team in several games, giving them multiple chances to post victories. In their final 14 games, Brown went 3–7–4, a poor record but good enough to get the Bears out of the conference cellar.\nThe Bears ended the year in 9th place and set them up against St. Lawrence in the First Round of the conference tournament. After losing the first game, Brown fought back to tie the series with an overtime victory and then built a 3–1 lead midway through the deciding match. Unfortunately, the Bears couldn't hold the advantage and after the Saints tied the game things looked bleak for the Brunos. While the game went into overtime, Brown had not scored more than three goals all season. To continue their campaign, the offense would have to rise to the occasion. However, before the Bears had a chance to generate any opportunities, St. Lawrence scored on the first shot of the extra period and ended Brown's season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Golden Griffins represented Canisius College and were coached by Trevor Large, in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nCanisius got off to a good start, winning games against three non-conference opponents and tying Clarkson, who finished the season in the top-20. Despite shoeing promise early, the Golden Griffins played inconsistently once their conference schedule began. While they led the Atlantic Hockey standings early, the team could only complete two weekend sweeps all season.\nCanisius received very capable goaltending from Jacob Barczewski but their offense was hit-or-miss. The Golden Griffins were limited to less than 3 goals in 18 games during the season with their leading goal-scorer, Max Kouznetsov, hitting just 12 for the year. In spite of their occasional offensive struggles, Canisius benefitted from Atlantic Hockey being a mediocre conference and finished in second place.\nThe Golden Griffins opened their postseason run with a home date against Mercyhurst but their offense failed them at the worst time. Canisius fired 63 shots on goal in two games but could only get a single marker in each contest. They lost the series, including a double overtime match in game 1, and would have to wait for another year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "The Match (golf)",
        "text": "The Match is a series of exhibition match play golf challenge matches that began in 2018. The event features major professional golfers or other notable athletes facing each other in a head-to-head competition. The format has varied throughout the run of the event; in all of the events, sports entertainment elements were included, particularly with the inclusion of sports betting elements in that the contestants wager portions of their prize on side bets during the contest. TNT Sports (formerly Turner Sports) has televised all eight iterations of the event. Since 2020, two iterations of The Match have been held each year, one in the spring or early summer and the other (usually) on Thanksgiving weekend. The Thanksgiving contest features professional golfers, often paired with an athlete from another sport; the spring contests, taking place during the PGA Tour season, normally consist solely of non-golfers, which to date have consisted of current or retired American football and basketball players competing during their respective sports' offseasons.\nBackground.\nJack Whigham, a Hollywood agent, and Bryan Zuriff, a film and TV producer, conceived the event. Zuriff was a fan of The Skins Game—a former PGA Tour unofficial event that was held around Thanksgiving weekend—and envisioned a concept for a golf event that would, as explained by Whigham, be \"played the way a lot of us play with our buddies on the weekends? You know, where you bet on everything and talk smack and basically have this continually running dialogue of giving each other\" grief.\nMark Steinberg, an agent who represented Tiger Woods (who competed in the first two events), contrasted the event with \"Monday Night Golf\"—a series of primetime, network television events largely intended to be a vehicle for Woods at the height of his popularity—stating that it would feature both sports and entertainment elements and not be focused purely on competitive aspects. The event would be jointly-owned by Woods and Phil Mickelson (an associate of Zuriff's and a competitor in the first four entries), but the entity still had to pay a rights fee to the PGA Tour—which would impose some restrictions and conditions on the presentation and format of the event.\nEvent details.\nTiger vs. Phil.\nThe first edition, titled , was played on November 23, 2018, between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, at the Shadow Creek Golf Course in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The purse for the event was $9 million, with the winner taking the entire amount. Mickelson won the match after 22 holes, including four playoff holes. The event was marketed as a pay per view by Turner Sports via \"Bleacher Report\" Live, but technical issues with the over-the-top distribution of the PPV forced the event to instead be streamed for free; Turner and other providers subsequently offered refunds.\nChampions for Charity.\nA rematch, \"The Match: Champions for Charity\", was played on May 24, 2020, at Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida. It featured a pro-am four-ball format with each golfer having a National Football League quarterback as his partner: Woods was paired with two-time Super Bowl champion Peyton Manning, and Mickelson with then six-time Super Bowl champion quarterback Tom Brady. Woods and Manning held off a late comeback from Mickelson and Brady to win by a single hole.\nThe match was broadcast live on TNT, TBS, HLN and truTV, drawing an average 2.8 million viewers, due in part to the fact that it was one of the first nationally televised live sports events to take place after sports worldwide were shut down in March. Brian Anderson was the host of the event, Trevor Immelman and Charles Barkley served as analysts, and Justin Thomas and Amanda Balionis were on-course reporters.\nChampions for Change.\nA third edition, titled \"The Match: Champions For Change\", took place on November 27, 2020, at Stone Canyon Golf Club in Oro Valley, Arizona. The match, benefitting historically black colleges and universities, was played using an American foursomes format. Mickelson partnered NBA hall-of-famer Charles Barkley, who played from a forward set of tees, to defeat Manning and NBA star Stephen Curry, 4 and 3.\nThe event was broadcast live on TNT, earning an average 1.0 million viewers. Anderson and Immelman returned as host and analyst, respectively, alongside NBA star Andre Iguodala, who was also an analyst. Gary McCord and Cheyenne Woods served as on-course reporters. Additionally, a \"Cart Cam\" stream was made available for the event exclusively through Bleacher Report with host Taylor Rooks and on-course correspondent Eli Manning.\nThe Match IV.\nA fourth edition of \"The Match\" took place on July 6, 2021. Mickelson and Brady competed against Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and professional golfer Bryson DeChambeau at The Reserve at Moonlight Basin in Big Sky, Montana. There was a slight change to the format, with greensomes replacing the American foursomes format used in the previous edition. DeChambeau and Rodgers won the match 3 and 2.\nThe fourth iteration of \"The Match\" was broadcast live on TNT, TBS, and truTV on July 6, 2021. Anderson, Barkley, and Immelman all returned as host and analysts, respectively, alongside NFL star Larry Fitzgerald, who made his debut on \"The Match\" an analyst. Cheyenne Woods returned as on-course reporter. Kevin Frazier of Entertainment Tonight also made his debut on \"The Match\" as the pre-match host, alongside Barkley, Fitzgerald, and Immelman.\nBryson vs. Brooks.\nA fifth edition took place between DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka on November 26, 2021, at Wynn Golf Club in Las Vegas. The match was a result of an ongoing \"feud\" between the two players. The format for the fifth version of the match returned to the original format of \"Tiger vs. Phil\", with the length of the match reduced to 12 holes. It was again broadcast across the outlets of Turner Sports, averaging 1.2 million viewers.\nNeither player had ideal preparation for the match, with Koepka missing the cut in his previous two tournaments and DeChambeau having played no tournament golf for two months. Koepka won four of the first eight holes, and claimed victory when DeChambeau failed to make his birdie putt on the ninth green and conceded. The players continued to play the next two holes, where DeChambeau won the longest drive and nearest the pin spot prizes for charity.\nThe Match VI.\nThe sixth edition of \"The Match\" was announced April 18, 2022 to be held on June 1, with a roster consisting entirely of American football quarterbacks: Brady and Rodgers were paired against Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes. It used a shamble format. Brady and Rodgers defeated Allen and Mahomes by one hole; the contest came down to the final putt, with Rodgers sinking the winning putt and Allen narrowly missing a long birdie putt that would have sent the match to a playoff.\nThis was the first edition of \"The Match\" to be distributed internationally via Eurosport, GolfTV, and Discovery+, following the merger of Discovery Inc. with Turner Sports parent company WarnerMedia to form Warner Bros. Discovery. GolfTV had previously attempted to run its own, similar franchise of golf events as part of a content deal with Woods. Ernie Johnson and Charles Barkley served as commentators for the competition.\nThe Match VII.\nThe seventh edition of \"The Match\" was held in prime time on December 10, 2022 at Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida. A mostly new roster of professional golfers took part after Mickelson, Koepka and DeChambeau were expelled from the PGA for competing in LIV Golf. Rory McIlroy paired with Woods—competing in his first televised event since the 2022 Open Championship, and still recovering from injuries sustained in a 2021 car crash—against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas in a four-ball event. Spieth and Thomas defeated Woods and McIlroy 3 and 2 in the 12-hole event.\nThe Match VIII.\nThe eighth edition of \"The Match\" was held on June 29, 2023, at Wynn Golf Club. This edition featured two championship-winning duos from different leagues, as Kansas City Chiefs teammates Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce beat Golden State Warriors teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson – the Splash Brothers.\nThe contest, which Mahomes and Kelce won decisively, was the least-watched event in the series, dropping to 782,000 viewers across all simulcast partners.\nNo edition of \"The Match\" was held in November or December 2023, after discussions with The Park Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida for a December 15 competition fell through due to schedule conflicts.\nThe Match IX.\nThe ninth edition of \"The Match\" was held February 26, 2024 at Park City Municipal Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida; it was a 12-hole skins game played between Max Homa, Rory McIlroy, Lexi Thompson, and Rose Zhang, and the first to involve LPGA players. The winner was eventually decided with a one-shot chip-off, in which Mcllroy hit closest-to-the-pin. The final scoring had Mcllroy with 10 skins, Thompson with two, and the others with zero."

        "text": "Biddy basketball, youth basketball or biddy ball, &amp; or ‘’’Mini Basketball’’’ is a type of basketball game that is played by youths. The game is popular internationally, and tournaments are held in places such as the United States, Puerto Rico and other countries. The game is played by boys and girls and unisex teams may be formed.\nHistory.\nThe competition is estimated to have first been created during either 1950 or 1951, by American sports enthusiast Jay Archer of Scranton, Pennsylvania.\nIn 1977, the town of Teaneck, New Jersey, hosted the \"Junior Biddy National Tournament\" with American teams from as far as Dallas, Texas attending and an international one from Puerto Rico. That tournament's championship was won by a team from New Orleans, Louisiana.\nRules and regulations.\nDepending on the formality of the games, rules can be similar to FIBA regulated games in a tournament setting or, in an informal setting such as a pick-up game, then the rules can be more akin to those observed during a streetball competition. \nUSA Basketball has published a set of rules for youth basketball games that is published online. According to those rules, players aged 7-8 shall play on a 50x42 sized court, with a basket height of eight feet, and a fourteen feet distance from the free throw line to the basket, while 9 to 11 year olds shall play on a 74x50 court and use a nine feet height hoop, with the free throw line also distanced from the basket by fourteen feet. At the group age of 12 to 14 year olds, the dimensions should be a ten feet basket in a 84x50 or 94x50 court, with the three-point line first being introduced at the Biddy level for this age group and being 19 feet from the basket, and the free throw line at 15 feet, while the last age group, the one made up by boys and girls between school grades ninth and twelfth, should be playing at a 94x50 court, with a basket ten feet above the court floor, and 15 feet separating the free throw line from the basket. The most notable difference in measures between the courts used by 12 to 14 year olds and ninth to twelve graders is the three point line distance, which shall be increased to 22 feet in distance for the latter.\nUSA Basketball's rules, however, are not universally used and can vary from one tournament to the other. The 1977 tournament in Teaneck, New Jersey, for example, was limited to 9 to 12 year olds.\nTournaments.\nFormal biddy basketball tournaments are usually played for championships and may have a structure that includes a playoffs and a finals best-of series to decide the tournament championship teams. Teams may have to pay a joining fee and players may have to pay a per-player fee (usually smaller than the team fee) in order to join as well.\nExternal links.\n6. Mini Basketball.org.uk"

It was her first major title, and she became the first qualifier to win a major. Additionally, she became the first British woman to win a singles major since Virginia Wade at the 1977 Wimbledon Championships, and the second player to win the US Open on her debut after Bianca Andreescu in 2019. Aged 18, Raducanu became the youngest major champion since Maria Sharapova at the 2004 Wimbledon Championships and with a ranking of world No. 150, the lowest-ranked player to win a major since Kim Clijsters at the 2009 US Open, and the youngest player to win the title since Serena Williams at the 1999 US Open. She also won the title without losing a set during the tournament, including during her three qualification matches, and was not taken to a tiebreaker in any set. This was her first WTA Tour singles title, making her the fourth woman in the Open Era to win a major as her first singles title.\nNaomi Osaka was the defending champion, but was defeated by Fernandez in the third round.\nThe final marked the first all-teenage major final since Serena Williams defeated Martina Hingis in 1999, and the first women's singles major final in the Open Era to feature two unseeded players. Raducanu and Fernandez both made their top 30 debuts following the tournament. Fernandez was the youngest player to defeat three top-five seeded players in the same major since Williams at the 1999 US Open.\nThis was the first major since the 2011 French Open and first US Open since 2003 where neither of the Williams sisters participated. This event also marked the final major appearance for former world No. 6 Carla Suárez Navarro, who lost in the first round to Danielle Collins.\nNone of the top 20 seeds lost prior to the third round, the first time this occurred since the introduction of the 32-seed format in 2001. The defeats of Karolína Plíšková and Barbora Krejčíková in the quarterfinals guaranteed two first-time major finalists; Raducanu and Fernandez emerged to become those players.

They represented Cornell University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 60th season in the ECAC Hockey conference. They were coached by Mike Schafer, in his 26th season, and played their home games at Lynah Rink.\nSeason.\nCornell began its season very well, appearing to have no hangover from its lost year. The Big Red won 9 of its first 10 games and swiftly rose up the rankings, finding itself in the top 10 after the first half of the season. The only problem for Cornell at the time was the strength of its schedule. ECAC Hockey, as a whole, had a dreadful non-conference result and saw many of its teams finding a home at the bottom of the PairWise rankings. Because of that, Cornell had little room for error but, as long as it played consistently for the remainder of the year, the Big Red should be able to earn a tournament bid.\nThe team returned from its winter break and promptly tripled its loss total for the year. The road series against Arizona State also saw the end of the goaltender rotation between Joe Howe and Nate McDonald as neither had been very reliable over the first dozen games. Mike Schafer turned to freshman Ian Shane as the starter and the young goalie began with a marvelous start, helping the Big Red sweep top-5 North Dakota and look like a sure thing for the tournament.\nPrior to the second game against the Fighting Hawks, Schafer tested positive for COVID-19 and was replaced on the bench by associate head coach Ben Syer. The head coach spend several weeks recovering from the virus but, towards the end of the battle, doctors discovered an issue with his circulatory system and found that Schafer needed a coronary stent. The news of their coach's health problem hit the team hard and Cornell went on a 6-game winless streak. The losses dropped the Big Red in the rankings and put them on the tournament bubble. Even after recovering towards the end of the regular season, the strength of schedule problem reared its head and stopped Cornell from being able to climb into the top-15 for the PairWise. Because of that, the team would have to have a strong performance in the conference tournament to have any chance at earning an at-large bid.\nSchafer returned to the bench just in time for Cornell's first playoff game and the team responded with an inspired 3–1 win over Colgate. The Big Red continued to play well in the next two games but were stymied by a stellar goaltending performance by Mitch Benson and were knocked out in the quarterfinals. Despite being 8 games over .500, the losses ended Cornell's once promising season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Big Green represented the Dartmouth College and were coached by Reid Cashman, in his 1st season as head coach.\nSeason.\nDartmouth returned to the ice after their previous season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Big Green began the year with a decent stretch, opening 2–3 with two of their losses coming against ranked teams. After a serviceable start, went winless in 6 consecutive games and ended the first half of their season near the bottom of the conference standings.\nAfter Christmas, Dartmouth opened their annual in-season tournament with a win over in-state rival New Hampshire. Unfortunately for the Big Green, the team would not record another victory for a month and a half. The biggest problem for Dartmouth was a lack of offense that continued for most of the season. The goaltending they received during the stretch gave Dartmouth several chances to win but the team's scoring rarely made an appearance.\nNear the end of the season, Dartmouth put together a few wins that just put them above Yale and prevented the Greens from finishing last in ECAC Hockey. That set them up for a showdown with Rensselaer in the conference tournament. When the team won its first match, it appeared that they may have accidentally found a way to extend their season.

        "title": "Alan Clarke (rugby league)",
        "text": "Alan Clarke was a rugby league player who represented New Zealand in one test match against England in 1932 at lock. In the process he became the 227th player to represent New Zealand. He also played rugby league for the North Island and Auckland representative sides as well as the Newton Rangers, and Marist Old Boys clubs.\nPlaying career.\nNewton Rangers debut.\nAlan Clarke began being named in the Newton Rangers senior side in the Auckland Rugby League competition in June 1922 whilst still aged just 16, 4 months off his 17th birthday. His debut came in a round 6 match against Richmond Rovers on June 10 and it was said that he and Voysey “responded well” as Newton won 32 to 8. At this stage of his career he was playing regularly in the back line and it wasn't until he was more established that he began to play in the loose forwards. On June 17 in a match with City Rovers he played on the wing and “showed pace, and should have received more opportunities”. He was also said to have played well in the “rear guard” in a July 1 loss to Ponsonby United at Carlaw Park. Clarke scored his first try in senior grade on July 22 against the Fire Brigade side. It was said to be a “cheap try” after Newdick of Fire Brigade was blinded by the sun whilst trying to field a kick. Clarke, who was playing in the forwards, was following up and he gathered and scored. Clarke finished the 1922 season playing 9 matches for Newton whilst adding a conversion to the try he scored for 5 points in his debut season.\nThe 1923 season saw Clarke play 12 matches for Newton, scoring 2 tries and kicking a penalty in a Roope Rooster first round loss to Marist Old Boys, a team he was to eventually join. He had played in a variety of positions and even took up the fullback position in their round 11 match against Devonport United.\nAuckland debut.\nIn 1924 Clarke played 8 matches for Newton and obviously impressed the selectors as he was named as a reserve for the Auckland B team in their match against Lower Waikato on August 20. He played 4 further matches for Newton and was then selected in a weakened Auckland side to play South Auckland (Waikato) on September 20. The final round of the Auckland first grade competition was being played and so players from Devonport, Marist, Richmond, and Athletic were all unavailable for selection. Unsurprisingly Auckland were easily defeated by 21 points to 5 at Steele Park in Hamilton.\nThe following season in 1925 Clarke played 12 games for Newton and scored 7 tries and kicked 5 goals. His first try of the season came in a match against Athletic where he combined with Victor Humby, Clarrie Polson, and Wally Somers. The New Zealand Herald listed him amongst the “prominent Auckland players… who have claims for selection”. From June 13 to July 18 he scored tries in 4 consecutive matches against Athletic, City, Richmond, and Marist respectively. The Herald commented following these matches that “it often takes some players several seasons to find their position in a team. This can well be applied to Clarke, of Newton. In the last two games Clarke has filled the position of wing-three quarter and in this place played a fine game against Richmond”.\nNorth Island selection.\n1926 saw Clarke play 10 games for Newton and he scored 37 points from 9 tries, 3 conversions and 2 penalties. This placed him 9th on the season scoring list for 1st grade competitions. Following their round 5 match with Marist the New Zealand Herald stated that “Clarke was easily the best forward on the ground. He displayed plenty of pace in the open and his handling and passing were excellent. He should go very near representative honours this season”. The next week he scored 3 tries in a 26–10 win over Grafton Athletic and was said to again be the best forward on the field with “his speed and clever handling enabling him to take part in most of the attacking movements. The claims of the Newton forwards for a place in the trial games cannot be overlooked”. On June 19 Newton played City and after the game the Herald wrote of the claims of various players to a place in the Auckland representative side. It was said that selectors Fox, McClymont and Asher had \"no easy task” and that “the form shown by many young players is very encouraging, and it will occasion no surprise to see many of those who usually gain places passed over in favour of younger men. This particularly applies to the forwards. Although only six are required, the claims of Clarke (Newton), A. Scott (Devonport), and Payne (Ponsonby) have already been discussed\". \nThe Auckland selectors chose 20 players to go into training for the match against Waikato and Clarke was included amongst the forwards. It was said “Clarke, of Newton, has on many occasions shown himself to be a clever forward, and, given an opportunity, he will not fail to bring himself in line with the best six forwards playing the game. Following the squads Thursday night training Clarke was named to play in the second row along with Lou Hutt, with Bert Avery at lock. The match was played at Carlaw Park on June 26 and saw Auckland run out easy winners by 49 to 15. Clarke had obviously impressed the selectors as he was then picked in the North Island side, a team he was to go on to represent on 3 further occasions. He played in the second row and was “equal to any of the North Island forwards [and] was a great worker in the loose and never let up against the solid opposition. The Newton forward has yet to gain experience but he has youth and fitness in his favour and should he gain a place in the [New Zealand] touring team, it can be safely said that he would return a polished forward”. At this stage of his career Clarke was still only aged 20, and a few months shy of his 21st birthday. The North Island won the match against the South Island 31 to 22 before a crowd of 18,000. The stakes had been particularly high with the New Zealand selectors looking to choose 26 players to tour England, Wales, and France. He was picked to play lock for Auckland against a “Rest of New Zealand” side on July 7. The Auckland team omitted several of their leading players to give others a chance to impress and Clarke “in the Auckland vanguard” did just that as he along with Alf Townsend and Jim O’Brien “were the best”.\nClarke was then selected in a New Zealand trial to be played as curtain raiser to the NZ Probables v Possibles match. He played in the A Team and scored a try in a 30–28 loss. He was subsequently named in the Auckland side to take on the New Zealand team prior to their departure for Europe but ultimately did not play in the game. Clarke then informed the selectors that he was also unavailable for selection for their match with Otago and it was stated in the Auckland Star that the reason was due to injury. He missed further matches for Newton against Richmond and Marist before eventually returning to play against Grafton on September 4. Clarke scored all 13 of Newton's points from 3 tries and 2 conversions in a 13 to 12 win. He scored another try and kicked 2 penalty goals in Newton's round 1 defeat in the Roope Rooster competition to Richmond. That was his final match of the season as he was named in the reserves for Auckland in their match with South Auckland but did not take the field.\nThe 1927 season saw Clarke open the season with a representative appearance for Auckland against the New Zealand side which had returned from their tour. He scored a try and kicked a conversion and a penalty in a 24–21 win before a crowd of 14,000 at Carlaw Park. He was in excellent form for Newton throughout the year being mentioned regularly by the press. Following a win over City on May 28 the Auckland Star said “much of Newton’s victory must be handed out to Clarke, who towered above his energetic pack as the best forward on the ground. He was the principal connecting link between the forwards and the rear guard, in addition to being up with everything that was going”. He was playing in the pack with Henry, Wally Somers, and Trevor Hall and they helped Newton to their 2nd ever first grade title with a 10 win, 1 draw, 2 loss record. Against Ponsonby United he was reported as “the most resourceful scrummager for Newton and the best forward on the ground”. Following the final round Newton had found themselves level with Ponsonby at the top of the table and so a playoff for the title was necessary. Newton won a match described as “one of the hardest contests for some years” by 6 points to 3 before 12,000 spectators at Carlaw Park. Clarke was said to have given “a brilliant display, being the best forward on the ground. He possessed rare pace and a nice swerve. With more experience, Clarke should develop into a great player”.\nHe was selected for Auckland ‘Southern Tour’ where they played matches with Canterbury, West Coast, Otago, and Wellington. On September 10 Clarke was part of the side who beat Canterbury 24–13 at Monica Park in Christchurch in front of 3,000. He also played in the 20–13 win over Otago at the Caledonian Ground in Dunedin where 2,000 watched. It is not known if he played in either of the other two fixtures as full lineups were not published in any of the nations newspapers.\nThen on returning to Auckland, Clarke was selected for the North Island side to play their annual match with the South Island. The North Island won by 13 points to 8 with Clarke said to have played well though he “was inclined to be uncertain”. He then finished his season playing in the Stormont Shield ‘champion of champions’ match against Richmond. Newton won for the only time in their history 25 to 14 with Clarke scoring a try. The match was notable for the large number of injuries with 3 Newton players taken to Auckland Hospital with broken bones and Somers spraining his ankle.\nThe 1928 season saw Clarke play 14 matches for Newton scoring 3 tries and kicking 1 conversion. He was chosen by selectors Fox, Avery, and Asher to play in the second row for Auckland in their June 16 match against South Auckland. In pouring rain Clarke “shone” along with Alf Scott, Payne, and Lou Hutt who all did well “in the loose play”.\nOn July 11 Clarke played for the Auckland Possibles side in a trial match against the Probables. His side won 24 to 14. He was subsequently picked for Auckland for their clash against the visiting Canterbury team. Auckland trounced them 66 to 26 with Clarke converting a try. He then played in Auckland's surprise defeat to South Auckland 19 points to 17.\nClarke was chosen for the New Zealand Possibles team in a trial match against the Probables. The selectors were endeavouring to finalise the New Zealand side to play 3 tests against the touring England team. His side went down 27 to 24 but he scored a try and kicked a penalty with the Auckland Star saying there was “no denying the fact that… Clarke was the outstanding forward in the trial game”. His teammate Hall had also missed selection and the New Zealand Herald writer commented prior to the naming of the first test side that “the two outstanding forwards were Hall and Clarke, who played great games. The Newton pair made a big impression and their speed and fine handling were greatly admired. Both must have a chance in the final selection”.\nHe was named to play for the Auckland provincial side which contained players from the Waikato against England but ultimately he didn't play in the match. Clarke did however turn out for Auckland against the tourists and he scored a try in a 26–15 loss at Carlaw Park before an enormous crowd of 25,000. Clarke played in the lock position with Bill Horton playing in the corresponding position for England. Clarke's try was a magnificent long range effort. Maurice Wetherill had broken through 25 five yards out from their own line and ran to halfway before he ”passed to Clarke. The Newton forward drove ahead, veering to the left with Brough and Frodsham in deadly pursuit. It was a great triangular race that roused the crowd to a high pitch of excitement. Keeping his course, Clarke held on long enough to cross the English line near the corner”. The try had pushed Auckland out to an 8–0 lead and they later led 15-6 before being run down.\nClarke played a handful of matches for Newton before the end of the season but also missed two games that he was initially chosen for Auckland against Otago and Northland respectively, and he missed Newton's semi final loss to Ponsonby in the Roope Rooster. This was to be Clarke's last involvement with the Newton club.\nTransfer to Marist Old Boys.\nThere was controversy to start the 1929 season involving Clarke, his Newton club and Marist Old Boys. On April 20 he played in a practice match for Marist. He had transferred to Christchurch but returned to Auckland and joined Marist. It was reported in the Christchurch Press that he \"had applied for a transfer to Christchurch, which had been granted, making him eligible to play for any club in Christchurch. [However] the secretary reported that the player had returned north\". His Newton club were not happy with the situation and asked for a “cancellation” of his transfer and that “he must play for Newton”. Clarke was however cleared to play for Marist after the Canterbury League granted him a clearance and debuted for Marist against Richmond on May 4. In a June 1 match against City Rovers Clarke was sent off for “straining the patience of the referee in querying decisions”. He was unable to play the following weekend as his disciplinary hearing was not held until June 12. They obviously deemed the one match missed to be sufficient as he played against Newton in round 8 on June 15. Clarke did however miss several matches and only came on as a replacement in Marist's round 14 match with Devonport. Despite finishing the season mid table Marist had struck excellent form in the second half of the season and went unbeaten through 12 matches to claim the Roope Rooster title with a 17–9 win over Ponsonby, and a 28–14 win over the same opponent to win the Stormont Shield. Clarke scored a try in the Roope Rooster final. He was said to follow up his good performance in the semi-final win over City “with an even better one on Saturday. He possesses anticipation above the average forward”. In the Stormont Shield final it was said that the Marist “forwards did some splendid work in the loose, O’Brien and Clarke standing out prominently”, although early in the second half Clarke had to leave the field with an injury. However Ponsonby had also lost Frank Delgrosso to injury shortly before and Marist ultimately ran away with the match to claim their second straight Stormont Shield title.\nMarist's form was so good that when the South Sydney side toured New Zealand for 3 matches the Auckland Rugby League decided that Marist should be their opponents for both matches played in Auckland. Clarke played in both games and in the first Marist won 10 points to 9 before 15,000 at Carlaw Park. Clarke played in a halfback position to counter Souths positioning. Australian sides often played with just 5 in the scrum and were more attacking by nature. It was said Marist “took Clarke from the scrum with a good deal of success…it was really surprising to see [him] fit in so well with a combination that has been together throughout the season”. \nThe following weekend saw Clarke playing in the lock position while South Sydney stayed with just 5 forwards and 8 backs. Souths ran out comfortable 21 to 5 winners. Clarke missed a try in the first half after his teammate “Brady mishandled”, though the two of them later “combined well and an infringement against the visitors saw Gregory kick a nice goal”. Towards the end of the match McDonald “missed an easy try by dropping a pass from Clarke”.\nAuckland and North Island selection once more.\nThe 1930 season saw Clarke play 14 times for Marist including a couple of appearances in the backs. In May he was chosen to train as part of the Auckland squad preparing for a match against Northland. He wasn't selected for the playing 13 but he did play for Auckland two weeks later on May 31 against South Auckland in a match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup. Auckland held it at the time but were defeated 13–12 at Carlaw Park with Clarke at lock.\nIn June Clarke once again made the North Island side to play against the South Island. The match was drawn 22-all before the “biggest crowd of the season”. Clarke scored a first half try “from a beautiful individual effort” and he “shone out on many occasions”. After the North Island had kicked a penalty “Clarke fielded the ball from the kick-off, raced right through the opposition, short-punted, and scored a spectacular try”. Craddock Dufty kicked the conversion from the side-line and the scores were level at 7-7. Clarke did however concede a penalty in the second half which the South Island goaled from to take a 17–9 lead before the North Island came back.\nThe New Zealand selectors had been watching the representative matches to choose the New Zealand team to tour Australia. Once again Clarke missed selection though he was chosen as emergency cover if any forwards were unable to tour. The Herald said that “the exclusion of Clarke, Marist, after his splendid game on Saturday is also a surprise. Clarke would make a much better third-row forward than Jones, South Auckland.\nOn August 23 Clarke had a chance to play against the New Zealand side after they had returned from their tour where they had performed disappointingly, winning just 5 matches and losing 7. New Zealand won the match 34 points to 27. The Auckland side did not play well aside from “in the loose, [with] Clarke and O’Brien being conspicuous for fast break-aways and raiding with the backs”. The NZ Truth newspaper said that “Alan Clarke is good enough for any Enzed team. He is as tough as nails. None of the Kiwi dreadnoughts could pace it out with him in the open”.\nFour days later on August 27 Clarke played in a midweek match in the ‘Wednesday Competition’ for the Private Taxi's side against Trotting Trainers. His side lost though he did kick a conversion in the 26 to 10 defeat with several fellow senior players in each side.\nIn 1931 Clarke began to take on more of the kicking duties for Marist. In 14 matches during the season he kicked 12 goals to go along with 3 tries. Marist won the Fox Memorial Shield when they took out the first grade competition with an 11 win, 1 loss record. Their final round match against Devonport decided the title with both teams tied on 20 competition points. Marist won 12 to 5 with Clarke said to have been one of those who shone and along with Johnson “did much to open up play for [the] backs”\nHe was then chosen to play for the North Island for the fourth and final time in his career. In total Marist had a remarkable eight players in the North Island side such was the quality of their senior side at the time. North Island side thrashed the South Island by 52 points to 23 with Clarke, playing lock scoring a try and kicking 5 conversions and a penalty for a 15-point haul. He was picked to play for Auckland against South Auckland but was ultimately unavailable for the match. His final match for the season was for a combined Marist and Devonport side against the touring Eastern Suburbs team. Clarke kicked a conversion and 2 penalties in a 14–13 win before 15,000 spectators at Carlaw Park.\nNew Zealand selection.\nThe 1932 season saw Clarke finally make a long-awaited appearance for New Zealand. He also had a strong year for Marist, playing 15 games and scoring 5 tries, 26 goals, and a drop goal for a total of 69 points. In July he was chosen in an Auckland XIII to play South Auckland. The Auckland side won 29 to 13 with Clarke converting 4 of their 7 tries. The match was notable for being the rugby league representative debut of Bert Cooke who was one of the try scorers.\nClarke was chosen for the New Zealand Probables side to play Possibles in a trial to select the New Zealand team to play the touring English side. The match was a curtain-raiser to the North Island v South Island match. He scored a try in a 37–16 loss. He was chosen to train with the Auckland squad in the lead up to their match with England. England won before 15,000 spectators at Carlaw Park by 19 points to 14. He played in the second row and converted Cooke's late try and kicked 2 penalties. At the start of the second half Clarke replaced Trevor Hall in the back row. It was said that there was an improvement in Auckland's play after the change however Clarke also missed four shots at goal and the New Zealand Herald speculated that “a good place-kick would probably have won the match for Auckland”.\nOn August 13 Clarke played in Marist's final regular season match against Newton and kicked 2 goals. Marist had finished runner up to Devonport.\nHe was then chosen in the New Zealand side for the third test against England. England had already secured the series after 24 to 9, and 25 to 14 wins in the first two tests. The Auckland Star suggested he “should give the good service of which he is capable as breakaway”. In a hard-fought match the tourists beat New Zealand by 20 points to 18 before a crowd of 12,000 at Carlaw Park with a try in the final minutes. Clarke failed to convert Hec Brisbane’s first half try which had given New Zealand an 8-5 lead. New Zealand nearly scored in the second half after a high Clarke kick with Brisbane crossing the line but play was pulled up for a knock on. It was said after the match that Clarke along with Stan Clark “made a vast difference” to the New Zealand team.\nHe finished the season by playing 4 more matches for Marist including a Roope Rooster final win over City by 28 points to 8 where he scored a try and kicked a conversion. He also kicked a penalty and a drop goal in a 15 to 8 win in the Stormont Shield final over Devonport United.\nRetirement.\nThe 1933 season saw Clarke only play a handful of matches for Marist. He played twice in May and once in mid June with his only points coming from a penalty in their match with Devonport. In 1934 he played more regularly but still only appeared in 10 matches, scoring 3 tries. His final ever appearance was for Marist against the touring Western Suburbs side who had won the New South Wales championship. Marist were narrowly defeated 21 to 19 with Clarke playing in the second row. He was fairly prominent in many moments in the match and the Auckland Star said that he along with Jim Laird, Keane, and Bakalich held their own in the rucks. The Herald also reported that Clarke, Laird, and Keane were the “best of the Marist forwards”. Clarke then retired a few weeks short of his 29th birthday after 13 seasons of first grade rugby league."

        "title": "Sydney Amateur Sailing Club",
        "text": "The Sydney Amateur Sailing Club (SASC) is one of the oldest sailing clubs in Australia and is located on Sydney's Lower North Shore, with its clubhouse on the western edge of Mosman Bay.\nEstablishment.\nThe Sydney Amateur Sailing Club was founded on 1 October 1872, starting with four boats and twelve members. It was formed in response by owners whose boats were too small (less than ) to be admitted into the existing yacht clubs. The inaugural commodore was J. H. Amora and the vice commodore was W. Backhouse. The first event held by the club was on 30 November 1872 in Sydney Harbour, with eight boats in the fleet. The initial meetings of the club were held at the Oxford Hotel. The first competitive races were held on the main harbour in early 1873.\nClubhouse.\nThe original clubhouse was located at Bennelong Point, now the location of the Sydney Opera House. The club acquired the current clubhouse in August 1962 and this is situated at Cremorne Point. Upon European settlement in 1788 the area became known as Careening Point and HMS \"Sirius\" was refurbished in the bay in 1789. The clubhouse building features in the famous painting,\"The Harbour from Mosman,\" \"1926\" by Arthur Streeton.\nFamous yachts.\nA number of club yachts have participated in the ocean classic Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. Some of these are \"Maluka\" (built 1933), \"Lolita\" (built 1946), \"Anitra V\" (built 1956, handicap winner 1957), \"Malohi\" (built 1959), \"Fidelis\" (built 1964), and \"Mister Christian\" (built 1965). Keeping Australian maritime history alive these classic yachts continue to race.\nGaffers Day.\nSince 1972 the club regularly hosts Gaffers Day for gaff rig sailing boats. Up to 90 yachts from around Australia sail on Sydney Harbour as a practical demonstration of the skills and technology used in the nautical past. Unique to Sydney, the club continues to foster wooden boats and traditional rigs that make them so distinctive.\nWomen on Water.\nThe club held it first Women on Water rally in 2020 to give women the opportunity, confidence and skills to sail. Since 1928 the club has encouraged women to take up sailing by holding regular events for boats to be sailed by women or by a crew member nominated by the owner. In 1928 the race was won by Miss Buckingham who defeated 13 rivals by 45 seconds.\nOn 2 March 1964 a SASC race made the front page of the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" when sixteen yachts collided off Bradleys Head whilst rounding the last buoy of a nine mile race. The collision was the largest in Australian yachting history. Fortunately, there was no serious injury or damage nor was a protest received.\nTrophies.\nEach sailing season the SASC has on offer over sixty trophies to be won. Perhaps one of the oldest continuous awarded trophies in Australian sailing is the Kelly Cup. A perpetual trophy for competition between the leading yachts from all divisions in the handicap point scores. It was donated by Commodore T.H. Kelly in 1893 as a Championship trophy."

        "text": "The 2021–22 Harvard Crimson Men's ice hockey season is the 121st season of play for the program. The represent Harvard University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 60th season in the ECAC Hockey conference. The Crimson are coached by Ted Donato, in his 17th season, and play their home games at Bright-Landry Hockey Center.\nSeason.\nReturning after losing an entire season to the COVID-19 pandemic, Harvard shot out of the starting gate. The team rode a hail of offensive firepower to four wins, including one over long-time rival Cornell. The Crimson swiftly found themselves ranked in the top-10, but the lofty position didn't last for long. Over the succeeding four weeks, Harvard's scoring all but vanished and the team won just once in six matches. The squad didn't fully recover until after the winter break but, even then, inconsistent play sent them sliding down the rankings.\nThroughout the entire season, Harvard never once found itself below .500, however, the Crimson were hampered by the general weakness of their conference. While Harvard was able to recover after missing a year, many of their compatriots were near the bottom of the national rankings. This meant that conference wins weren't particularly helpful while most losses were severely taxing. To make matters worse, when Harvard played in the Beanpot, the best chance for the team to gain in the PairWise, Boston College was having an unusually bad year and going winless in the tournament dealt a serious blow to Harvard's postseason hopes. Evan a win over #4 Quinnipiac near the end of the year didn't markedly improve their chances and when their regular season came to a close, Harvard had no chance to make the NCAA tournament without a conference championship.\nECAC tournament.\nThe Crimson received a bye into the quarterfinal round but the time off didn't appear to help. Harvard found itself down 0–3 to Rensselaer and was unable to score at even strength. Desperate to give his team an advantage, Ted Donato was forced to pull Mitchell Gibson with about 5 minutes to play but the ploy worked. Harvard scored three times with an extra attacker, the last with just 15 seconds remaining in regulation, and tied the game. With all of the momentum now in the Crimson's favor, the team took charge in overtime and Jack Donato won the game after just a couple of minutes. The team found its position reversed in the second game when, after taking an early 2–0 lead, Harvard surrendered three consecutive goals and had to fight to tie the game for a second straight match. While they were able to do so, Rensselaer fought hard in the overtime and managed to secure the winning marker just after the start of the fifth period. In the rubber match, the defense finally put together a complete game and held the Engineers off of the scoresheet for more than 56 minutes. RPI managed to score their only goal of the game late in the third but it was not enough to overcome Harvard's lead and the Crimson escaped with a series victory.\nHarvard faced Clarkson in the semifinal and came out swinging. The Crimson twice took a lead in the game but the Golden Knights quickly replied both times. By the start of the third period it appeared that Harvard was going to be sunk by taking bad penalties, but their top line surged in the final frame. Nick Abruzzese, Matthew Coronato and Sean Farrell, who had already combined for 5 points, spearheaded the Crimson comeback and scored three goals in the third. While the team took two more penalties, their defense held and stopped Clarkson from replying, sending the Crimson to the conference title game.\nWith their hopes of a postseason bid nearly achieved, Harvard had to get past the stingiest defense in the country. The team's offense was severely limited in scoring opportunities, recording just 12 shots in regulation to Quinnipiac's 42, but the Crimson were able to get two past Yaniv Perets and push the game into overtime. The opportunities were much more even in the extra session and, about mid-way through the period, Harvard's top line was again the hero when Coronato fired the winning goal from the top of the left circle.\nNCAA tournament.\nHarvard's reward for winning their conference title was being placed opposite the #1 team in the nation, Minnesota State. The Mavericks had lost just once since late November and looked primed for a championship run. The game was playing out as expected with MSU dominating play and taking a 3–0 lead before the match was half over. The Crimson looked like they were going to be swept out of the building until Sean Farrell fired a puck from behind the goal line that deflected off of Dryden McKay and into the net. The luck break was just what the team needed and, less than a minute later, Harvard had cut the deficit to 1. Minnesota State halted the Crimson charge in the third, regaining their 2-goal edge, but Harvard would not surrender so easily. After forcing the Mavericks into a penalty in the final 5 minutes, Gibson was pulled and Casey Dornbach scored on the ensuing 2-man advantage. In the final minutes, Harvard went on total attack with their goaltender sitting on the bench. Coronato twice had looks at a half-empty cage but wasn't able to get a shot on goal. In the end the comeback bid fell just short and Harvard's season was over.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Crusaders represented the College of the Holy Cross and were coached by Bill Riga, in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nUnder their new head coach, the Crusaders started the season poorly, winning just one of their first ten matches. The offense slowly improved as the season went along, but Holy Cross couldn't keep the puck out of their own net, allowing at least 3 goals in fifteen of their eighteen games in the first half of the year. It was no coincidence that they won all three of those games.\nThe second half of the year was going much like the first and Holy Cross found itself mired in at the bottom of the Atlantic Hockey standings. Throughout January, the defense played much better but the team's scoring dried up. However, the Crusaders seemed to turn things around when the defeated the top team in the conference, American International, at the end of the month. In the final four weeks of the regular season, Holy Cross won nearly as many games as they had through the first four months. While they were too far back in the standings to move up, the late surge gave the team hope that they could advance in the postseason.\nHoly Cross opened at Mercyhurst and outplayed the Lakers in both games.

The location of the tournament is still yet to be announced.\nQualification will begin in 2024 with European qualification tournament.\nBackground.\nThe allocation of teams for the 2026 World Cup was announced on 7 August 2023. The 2026 edition of the Rugby League World Cup will only feature ten men's teams, down from 16 in 2021. The eight quarter-finalists from the previous World Cup achieved automatic qualification, leaving two spots remaining for the qualification process.\nThe qualification process for the 9th and 10th places will be a two stage process. The first stage is to establish the representatives from each of the four International Rugby League (IRL) confederations (Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East-Africa) with those representatives advancing to the second and final round of qualification, the world Series to be played in 2025. \nThe process announced in August 2023 would have seen qualifying tournaments in all four confederations but subsequent changes by the IRL have changed this. In October 2023 IRL confirmed that only full members of the IRL can take place in the qualifying competition. This left only (Asia-Pacific), (Americas) and (Middle East-Africa) as the only full-member nations for their respective confederations, and therefore will automatically advance to the second round of qualification. \nThis leaves the European confederation as the only one to stage a confederation tournament to decide their second-round slot allocation.\nFollowing the conclusion of the European confederation qualification tournament, the 2025 World Series will take place.\nEuropean qualifying.\nThe European confederation qualification tournament is scheduled to take place in 2024, with dates and venues to be announced. On 14 March 2024, Ireland, Italy and Scotland had their membership downgraded to affiliate members due to non-compliance with the membership policy, and as a result would no longer be eligible to participate in the World Cup qualification process. The format of the tournament are still to be confirmed, but the winner of the tournament will advance to the World Series in 2025.\nThough the participating teams are still yet to be confirmed, the teams which are eligible to participate in the European qualification process are:\nWorld Series.\nThe 2025 World Series will be the inter-confederation qualification tournament for the 2026 Rugby League World Cup.

It was held on 14 October 2021, at the convention center in the PortAventura World resort in the province of Tarragona. The tournament was broadcast live in its entirety on Llanos's Twitch channel, and culminated with Peruvian Francesco de la Cruz defeating German Jan Spiess in the final.\nBackground.\nIbai was inspired to organize the tournament by a video of American siblings Antonio, Diego and Isabel Arredondo playing a game of keep-up with a balloon in their Canby, Oregon home, which Ibai tweeted with the caption \"I want to buy the rights to this and set up a World Cup.\" Antonio and Diego attended the tournament in Spain to represent the United States, but Diego was eliminated early after a first-round loss to Cuba's Eric Guzmán González.\nStaff.\nLlanos enlisted several panelists of Spanish sports talk show \"El chiringuito de Jugones\" for the event's staff, including former La Liga assistant referee Rafa Guerrero as one of the referees for the tournament's matches, and Alfredo Duro, Jorge D'Alessandro and Ander Cortés as commentators.\nFormat.\nIn spite of the championship having initially been announced as a 24-country tournament with a group stage that would ensure every participant played at least two matches, this was abandoned when the field was expanded to 32 participants, opting instead for a single knockout tournament.

It is a steppingstone between the Farah Palmer Cup and the Black Ferns. Aupiki translates as ‘\"the ascent to the upper most realm\"’.\nFormat.\nIn 2022, the four teams were supposed to have three regular season matches with one home and away game, and one Super Round fixture. The top two teams at the end of the three rounds would contest the final. The competition was reformatted as a round robin fixture because of the impact of COVID-19. All the squads were strongly affected with player isolations and COVID-19 cases. The inaugural champion was crowned based on their competition points after the final round.\nThe 2023 season is expected to be played over a period of five weeks with ten games in total. Each team will play three regular season matches and two play-off matches.\nExpansion in 2024 will see a seven week season comprising six weeks of home and away round-robin matches for each club and a final to be played between the two top teams at the conclusion of the regular season. In addition, a four week formal pre-season period will be played which will include two pre-season matches. \nHistory.\nThe Chiefs Manawa won the inaugural title of the 2022 Super Rugby Aupiki season. They defeated the Blues Women 35–0 in the final round of the competition.\n2023.\nMatatū were crowned 2023 Super Rugby Aupiki champions after beating Chiefs Manawa 33–31 in a hard-fought match. Matatū won their first title and also handed defending champions, Chiefs Manawa, their first-ever loss in the competition.\n2024.\nThe 2024 season will see an expansion of squad sizes to 30 players for each Aupiki team and an increase in the season to seven weeks consisting of six weeks of home and away rounds plus a final. Also included in the expansion of the competition were a more than doubling of player payments to include a four-week pre-season and eight-week player preparation period. The pre-season period will include two pre-season matches for each Aupiki club; possibly with Australian Super W teams. This will give the finalists a total of nine professional matches for the first time in New Zealand domestic women’s rugby history.\nTeams.\nThere are four teams that compete in the competition. The three teams based in the north are aligned with their Super Rugby franchises, namely the Blues, Chiefs and Hurricanes. The southern team, Matatū, is governed by the Crusaders and also includes the Highlanders region.\nChampions.\nThe following sides have won Super Rugby Aupiki titles. \nPlayers.\nAll four sides will contract 28-players for the inaugural Super Rugby Aupiki season. All players will be paid for participating within the tournament, with all players being on professional or semi-professional contracts.\nTelevision.\nMatches in the Super Rugby Aupiki competition will be shown by Sky Sport in New Zealand."

        "text": "The 2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony was held at Beijing National Stadium, China on 4 February 2022. As mandated by the Olympic Charter, the proceedings are expected to combine the formal and ceremonial opening of this international sporting event, including welcoming speeches, hoisting of the flags and the parade of athletes, with an artistic spectacle to showcase the host nation's winter culture and modern history. The Games were officially opened by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and president of the People's Republic of China.\nThe opening ceremony was directed by film director and producer Zhang Yimou, who has previously directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics, which was China's first time hosting the Olympics. \nThe world's largest LED screen ( and uses 40,000 LED modules) was unveiled at the opening ceremony.\nThe ceremony was also marked by diplomatic boycotts from certain countries among other concerns and controversies.\nTheme and concept.\nThe themes of the opening ceremony are:\nAs stated by Zhang Yimou, in an Olympic first, all of the segments along with the International Olympic Committee protocols, were merged into one integrated programme in the opening ceremony.\nPreparations.\nThe final stage in preparations for the event and performance stages at the Bird's Nest were completed in October. A full-scale dress rehearsal was held on 22 January 2022, with approximately 4000 participants featuring in it.\nProceedings.\nA 30-minute pre-show performance kicked off at 19:25, featuring square dancers aged from five to over 70 years old. Apart from the live performances, people from other Chinese cities joined the pre-show performances through video recording. The pre-show performance was performed primarily by residents of Beijing and Hebei Province, showcasing the passion of the Chinese people in welcoming the Olympic Winter Games.\nAt 20:00, the words \"\" (\"guònián hǎo\", \"Happy New Year\") and \"Happy Chinese New Year\" appeared on the stage after the 30-minute long performances, symbolizing China's hospitality and celebrations of the traditional Chinese festival.\nChinese paramount leader Xi Jinping, Chinese First Lady Peng Liyuan, IOC President Thomas Bach, international dignitaries and various Chinese government officials arrived at the stadium before the official start of the ceremony, receiving huge cheers and welcome from the crowds and the performers from the pre-show performances.\nRites of spring: Countdown performance.\nThe ceremony began with a 24-second countdown, which represented the 24th Winter Olympics as well as the 24 solar terms in the Chinese calendar, where Lichun (ecliptic longitude 315°), Feb 4, is generally regarded as the \"Beginning of spring\". After the countdown, dancers carried tall and flexible glowing green stalks, showing the lifecycle of the dandelion, which eventually turned white and floated up into the sky as the seeds dispersed, followed by fireworks displaying the words \"\" (\"lìchūn\", \"the beginning of spring\") and \"Spring\", celebrating the beginning of spring. At the beginning of the ceremony, a film about Dundbulag rock carvings from Altay in the Altay Prefecture was shown. Skiing is likely to originate from Altay per the 2015 Altay Declaration made by scholars from 18 countries.\nChinese President Xi Jinping and IOC President Thomas Bach were then introduced by the MCs, receiving warm welcome from the crowds again.\nEntry of the National flag.\nZhu De'en, a trumpeter, played a patriotic Chinese song \"My People, My Country\". Twelve children lifted the national flag of China and entered the stadium, symbolizing the legacy of Beijing 2008 opening ceremony. They then passed the national flag to a line of representatives from different strata of society and 56 ethnic groups of China, symbolizing national unity and the deep relationships between the national flag and the citizens. The representatives then handed over the flag to 8 PLAGF Honor Guard soldiers, who then unfurled and raised the flag while the crowd sang the Chinese national anthem.\nOlympic Rings Reveal.\nThe Olympic Rings performance began with the giant LED screens showing a drop of ink that had fallen from the sky, turning into seething, rolling waves of the Yellow River, from which an ice cube crystallizes. 24 \"laser beams\" sequentially \"carve\" the names of cities and countries of 23 previous Winter Olympics in Chinese and English on this cube. The 24th was shown when the rays merged into a single beam, which \"cut out\" \"2022 BEIJING CHINA\". Six hockey players then entered the stadium and swung at a massive LED hockey puck. It flew into the cube, slowly fracturing it as the five ice Olympic rings rose from behind. Next, a Chinese ice door opened behind them, and athletes began to enter the parade of nations.\nParade of nations.\nFollowing the formation of the ice Olympic rings, greetings appeared in the stadium in many languages of the world. Per tradition, the national team of Greece, the country of origin of Olympics marched first. The country that will host the next Winter Olympics, Italy, marched before the host nation, China, which entered last. The patriotic song \"Ode to the Motherland\" was played when China entered the stadium. Other teams, in the same practice of the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics, entered in a collation method based on their countries names as written in Simplified Chinese characters and is similar to that used in Chinese dictionaries. The names were sorted by the number of strokes in the first character of the name, then by the stroke order of the character (in the stroke count method order), then the number of strokes and stroke order of the second character, then next character and so on. In front of each country's delegation, a Chinese representative carried a snowflake-shaped sign with the name of the delegation in both English and Chinese. After the parade, all such \"snowflakes\" of the participating delegations formed a large \"snowflake\" to symbolise the world coming together.\nBackground music used during the parade of nations: \nOpening of the Olympic Games.\nCai Qi, President of the Beijing 2022 organizing committee delivered a speech to thank and welcome the athletes, offering words of peace and unity. IOC President Thomas Bach then gave his speech in which he thanked China for being gracious hosts and also extended gratitude to those on the doctors and nurses combating the global COVID-19 pandemic. Bach urged world leaders to \"give peace a chance\" amid the traditional Olympic truce and instructed athletes to \"show how the world would look like, if we all respect the same rules and each other\". He also called for the end of various types of discrimination, especially against Asians worldwide.\nOn IOC President Thomas Bach's invitation, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing officially open.\nFireworks then shined the sky, forming the shape of a \"Welcome Pine\", one of the symbols of the Huangshan, symbolizing China's warm welcome to guests from all over the world.\nTribute to the People.\nThe performance began by a group of young people consisted of local and foreign university students, walking on the stage with the Chinese song \"Let the World be Filled with Love\" (, Ràng shìjiè chōngmǎn ài) sung in the background. After they walked past the stage, the slogan \"Together for a shared future\" (, Yīqǐ xiàng wèilái) in both English and Chinese appeared. Later, a group of ice skaters on the LED floor, carving out paths for them to follow, all to the theme of John Lennon's \"Imagine\" cover song The Olympic motto \"Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together\" () also in both English and Chinese then appeared.\nOlympic Flag Entry and Raising.\nThe Olympic Flag entered into the stadium.

Although the toddlers fell over and over again, they did not lose heart and persisted.\nSnowflakes performance.\nIn the performance, hundreds of children wandered around the center stage singing the theme song of the ceremony titled “Snowflake”. The LED floor beneath them used large-scale motion capture to illuminate glows of snowflakes and stars under their feet. The children played happily, holding dove lamps and lanterns, leaving trails of glittering snowflakes as they went. As the song and dance came to a close, the children surrounded a massive snowflake in a heart-shaped formation while singing. The large snowflake consisted of 91 snowflake-shaped placards used for each participating country during the \"Parade of Nations\". The snowflake theme ran through the entire ceremony representing solidarity and prosperity.\nArrival and lighting of the Olympic flame.\nAt 22:10, the Olympic Flame from Olympia reached the stadium. After the Olympic anthem, it was passed around the stadium by five athletes born in the 1950s (Zhao Weichang), 1960s (Li Yan), 1970s (Yang Yang (A)), 1980s (Su Bingtian) and 1990s (Zhou Yang). The final torch-runners were two athletes born in the 2000s: Skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang and Nordic mixed skier Zhao Jiawen, who fitted the torch carrying Olympic flame in the center of the large \"snowflake\" engraved with the names of the 91 countries competing. For the first time in Olympic history the passing torch itself formed the main flame of the Olympic cauldron, known as a \"microflame\" (, Wéi huǒ). Director Zhang Yimou stated that the tiny flame symbolised environmental sustainability and set the standards for a \"carbon-neutral\" game.\nThe following were the seven final torch-runners:\nDue to the backlash China received for the persecution of Uyghurs in China, several Western media outlets speculated about the message China was intending to send with Dilnigeer's selection.\nDignitaries in attendance.\nInternational.\nHeads of government and state\nHeads of international organizations\nRoyalty\nOthers\nControversy and concerns.\nTaiwan's participation.\nOn 26 January 2022, a spokesperson of China's Taiwan Affairs Office \"incorrectly\" called the Chinese Taipei (Taiwan) team \"Taipei, China\". Later that day, Taiwan announced that their Olympic team would not attend the opening and closing ceremonies in Beijing, formally due to anti-COVID-19 rules and delayed flights. The same day, another Taiwan official stated that Taiwan would be diplomatically boycotting the ceremonies as well. On 28 January 2022, a Taiwan official also stated concern that the Chinese Taipei (中华台北) and Hong Kong, China (中国香港) delegations would be adjacent to each other in the Parade of Nations due to the Chinese collation order, \"downgrading\" Taiwan's status.\nBetween 29 January and 31 January 2022, the International Olympic Committee repeatedly contacted the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, stating that it was obligated to attend the ceremonies to \"comply with the Olympic Charter\". (The IOC had already suspended North Korea for not sending a team to the Tokyo Summer Games in violation of the Olympic Charter.) On 1 February 2022, Taiwanese officials relented on their boycott. According to attendees of the rehearsal of the opening ceremony, Japan and Chinese Taipei marched adjacently, followed by \"a few\" countries, followed by Hong Kong, preventing the Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong delegations from being adjacent. However, during the actual opening ceremony, Japan, Chinese Taipei, and Hong Kong marched adjacently in that order.\nOn China's state media, the broadcast of the opening ceremony cut away to a clip of Xi Jinping when the Chinese Taipei delegation paraded, while the broadcast's commentator announced the delegation's name as \"Taipei, China\".\nRatings on NBC network.\nGroups critical of China's human rights record, urged viewers to boycott the 2022 Games on television. In the United States, NBC's live broadcast of the ceremony was the lowest watched opening ceremony in U.S. history. TV coverage of the 2022 Games overall has continued to trend down in ratings since Pyeongchang 2018 and the Tokyo Games just six months prior, while streaming continued to see massive increases.\nHanbok controversy.\nSome South Korean people were angered and accused China of appropriating Korean culture as their own, as one of the performers representing the ethnic Koreans in China wore a traditional choson-ot when delivering the national flag of China. Democratic Party presidential nominee Lee Jae-myung, People Power Party presidential nominee Yoon Suk-yeol, People's Party presidential candidate Ahn Cheol-soo joined the fray and expressed their discontent. However some South Koreans felt their politicians' reactions were misguided, and say that it was clear to them, that the woman was representing the estimated 2 million ethnic Koreans who live in China. The Chinese Embassy in South Korea responded that China respected the historical and cultural traditions of South Korea, and hanbok belongs to ethnic Koreans everywhere, including in China."

After a good first year, Wells led the Falcons' defense in scoring as a sophomore. Unfortunately, the team flagged badly and posted the worst record in program history. Wells was named an alternate captain for his junior season and responded by more than doubling his point total. He finished third on the team in scoring and helped the team recover by winning 11 more games than the year before. He was named team captain for his final year and tied for the team lead in scoring, becoming the first defenseman in program history to achieve that feat. He led the team to its first winning season in 4 years and was named as an All-American for his achievements.\nAfter graduating in 1994, Wells began his professional career. He spent six years playing at the highest level of the minor leagues in North America but wasn't able to earn a callup to the NHL. In 2000 he decided to travel across the Pacific and spent a year with the Seibu Bears. He returned the following year, spending part of the 2002 season with the Toledo Storm and then went into semi-retirement. He played a handful of games over the succeeding 4 years, finishing up with the Fort Worth Brahmas.\nPersonal.\nWells' son Justin followed in his father's footsteps, matriculating to Bowling Green and spending 4 years with the program before transferring to Boston College as a graduate."

        "text": "World Series of Country Music Proudly Presents Stock Car Racing's Entertainers of the Year is a studio album released in 1985 by World Series of Country Music. The album was compiled of 21 original country music songs with lead vocals of all songs all sung by various NASCAR drivers, plus an introduction track by Ned Jarrett. \nBackground.\nThe album was the creation of country music promoter Mike Hopkins, who wanted to create a concept album featuring NASCAR's biggest stars to express themselves musically. Hopkins, trying to avoid the flop of \"NASCAR Goes Country\", hired 25 professional songwriters to write songs for the album, of which 80 songs were created, and 21 were chosen for drivers to sing. Songs were chosen based on a driver interview, asking them what drove their ambition, heroes, families, and more. Hopkins told the songwriters \"Here are the words of an auto racer, what he believes, what he stands for. You go and write me a song from this material.\" Around $200,000 was poured into the project.\nMany of the songs relate to achievements or the drivers' personality. For example, Bobby Hillin Jr. talks about his crew chief, Harry Hyde. Dale Earnhardt's song, \"Hard Charger\", relates to his rough reputation. Bill Elliott's song talks about his career.\nFans formerly could order an album by sending $19.95 plus $3.00 handling to World Series of Country Music. To help promote the album, NASCAR driver and legend Ned Jarrett would make commercials promoting the album in 1985.\nReception.\nWhile better than the previous album including NASCAR drivers, it was still a flop. Only 20,000 copies were ever sold, and the album was eventually pulled a couple of years later by the label. The album has gone largely into obscurity, but on occasion NASCAR and its drivers still remember the album."

This was due to new travel restrictions between the UK and France introduced by the French government on 18 December 2021. This resulted in multiple 0–0 draws and 2 match points given to each team.\nSeeding.\nFor the purposes of the pool draw, the 24 clubs were separated into tiers based on their league finishing position, and clubs from the same league in the same tier were not drawn into the same pool. The number 1 and number 2 ranked clubs from each league are in Tier 1, the number 3 and number 4 ranked clubs are in Tier 2, the number 5 and 6 ranked clubs are in Tier 3, and the number 7 and number 8 ranked clubs are in Tier 4.\nPool play will feature the Tier 1 teams playing the Tier 4 teams in their pool (that are not from the same league) twice in a home and away manner, while the Tier 2 and 3 clubs will follow in a similar manner.\nThe four teams from each pool with the best points will qualify for the knockout stage. Teams finishing 5th through 8th after pool play will join the Challenge Cup at the round of 16 stage (joining eight qualifiers from the Challenge Cup pool stage) In total, eight weekends of play will be provided for, one less than in previous seasons.\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 21 July 2021, at the Lausanne, Switzerland.\nTeams in the same pool play two other teams twice, at home and away, in the group stage. The top eight teams in each pool progress to the round of 16, with the teams ranked 9-11 progressing to the 2021–22 European Rugby Challenge Cup round of 16.\nTeams are awarded group points based on match performances. Four points are awarded for a win, two points for a draw, one attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and one defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers are used, as directed by EPCR:\n(Q) denotes the team has qualified for the Champions Cup quarter-finals\n(q) denotes the team has qualified for the Challenge Cup quarter-finals"

        "text": "Royal Golf Dar Es Salam is a golf club located in Rabat, the capital of Morocco. It has hosted tournaments on the European Tour and the Ladies European Tour.\nHistory.\nThe late King Hassan II wanted to build a flagship 36-hole complex in Morocco's capital, Rabat. A sandy, tree-lined property with a rolling contour was chosen, and the 440 hectare domain in the heart of a cork oak forest became Royal Golf Dar Es Salam (House of Peace). Designed by Robert Trent Jones and his long-time European-based associate, Cabell Robinson, it opened in 1971. According to the journal Golf Course Architecture, the Red Course is a strong contender for the title of best course by Jones. \nThe Red Course is arguably the best known tournament course in Morocco, having hosted the Trophée Hassan II since it opened. It was ranked among the World's Top 100 courses as recently as the early 1990s. It was redesigned in 2017–2018 by James Duncan, a long-time associate with Coore and Crenshaw design, focused on tree removal, bunker reconstruction and green enlargement.\nBefore the Hassan II Golf Trophy became a European Tour event in 2001 it was held on an invitational basis from 1971. Past winners include Billy Casper, Lee Trevino, Vijay Singh, Payne Stewart, Nick Price, Colin Montgomerie and Ernie Els."

Raiders linebacker Archie Matsos intercepted a pass and won the defensive MVP award.\nRosters.\nThe 22 offensive and defensive players for the two teams were decided by a players' vote, while head coaches Sid Gillman and Mike Holovak named the remainder of the 29-man squads, also selecting replacements for players forced to pull out.\nThe game.\nThe East dominated the opening half, scoring on four out of six possessions. West starting quarterback Tobin Rote struggled with accuracy and was intercepted twice. A pair of Chargers, Keith Lincoln and Paul Lowe scored rushing touchdowns in the 3rd quarter to get the West back into the game. It was 24–20 with barely a minute to play when Lance Alworth returned a punt to the East 43. Four plays later, backup quarterback Cotton Davidson passed to Raiders teammate Art Powell for the winning touchdown, with Powell making a tumbling catch in the end zone."

        "title": "Netherlands-Pakistan field hockey record",
        "text": "This article lists various team and individual Netherlands-Pakistan field hockey records between the national field hockey teams of both countries. Netherlands and Pakistan are one of the most successful teams in international field hockey, between the two teams is a record seven Hockey World Cup titles and five Olympic gold medals won. The sport enjoys popular sport in both the countries.\nBoth countries have regularly competed since their first meeting at the 1948 Olympics in London. Both teams have produced world best players of their times, likes of Hassan Sardar, Shahbaz Ahmed, Kaleemullah Khan and Sohail Abbas for Pakistan and Ties Kruze, Paul Litjens, Bram Lomans and Tuen de Nooijer for Netherlands. Both teams are considered as the most excellent exports of different styles of hockey the European and Asian style.\nHistory.\nThe game was first introduced in Netherlands around the late 1800s and in 1892 the first game of field hockey was played in the country. The game gained quick popularity and soon Netherlands started to compete in international events including the Summer Olympics. The sport around the same time was brought by British servicemen in the subcontinent during the era of British India. The game also gained mass popularity there and after the independence of Pakistan from British rule in 1947 the sport was carried on by players who formerly played for the Indian team. The first international match between the two was played at the pool stage of the 1948 Olympics where Pakistan won with a margin of 6–1. Tanvir Dar of Pakistan scored four goals including the first goal of the match. The teams again met in the match for third place where it ended in a 1–1 draw so a replay was scheduled the next day, Netherlands won 4–1 to clinch bronze medal at the event. Two weeks later after the Olympics Pakistan traveled to Netherlands to play a friendly match at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam. The match ended in goalless draw, this was the first instance one team hosted the other in its country.\nThroughout the next decade both teams met each other occasionally with the match at the 1952 Olympics being the most prominent, Netherlands won 1–0. In 1967 Netherlands toured Pakistan for the first time for a three match series along with side matches with district based club teams Pakistan won the series 2-0 The following year Pakistan recorded a 6–0 victory against Netherlands at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico their biggest win to this day.\nFrom the 1970s and onwards with the introduction of more international tournaments like the Hockey World Cup, Hockey Champions Trophy and increase of test series between the two the number of matches became frequent and a highlight of the sport. Pakistan and Netherlands have met in three World Cup finals in 1978, 1990 and 1994.\nPakistan remained the better win loss ratio for two decades from 1960 to 1980s and won more matches but in the 1990s that margin became less and Netherlands gained the dominance from the 2000s until now. During the 2006 Hockey Champions Trophy match in Terrassa, Spain Netherlands recorded a win by 9–2 against Pakistan the biggest win by margin between the two ever and at that time Pakistan's biggest defeat in history as well.\nThe hockey federations of both countries enjoy close ties. There are regular tours done by Pakistani hockey academies to Netherlands where they play practice matches. Netherlands' Hoofdklasse is considered as the world's best hockey league in the world with players form around the top hockey playing nations participating in it. Many Pakistani players have appeared in the league and some players like Sohail Abbas and Shahbaz Ahmed were the main crowd attraction during their playing time in the Netherlands. Dutch players also enjoy popular support in Pakistan with players like Floris Jan Bovelander and Paul Litjens being quite popular in Pakistan during international tournaments in the country.\nHistorical matches.\n1968 Olympics.\nBoth teams met at the opening match of the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City Pakistan remained in complete dominance from the start after Tanvir Dar put Pakistan ahead from a short corner. Pakistan scored two more goals within two minutes of each goal, first Muhammad Asad Malik shot from a pass of a long corner in the thirteenth minute two minutes later Ashfaq Ahmed connected a cross from Khalid Mehmood on the right wing to make the score 3–0 at half-time. The game's picture remained the same in the second half with Pakistan completely dominating its opponent. Abdul Rashid Jr. scored to make it 4–0 in the fiftieth minute and later in the fifty eighth minute scored another. Tanvir Dar earned another short corner in the sixty third minute and converted yet again to make the score line 6–0 at the end of the play. This was the biggest win by margin between two at the time. \n1971 World Cup.\nIn the inaugural edition of the FIH Hockey World Cup in Barcelona, Spain Pakistan and Netherlands were the favorites. Pakistan had won its first game against Australia by 5-2 Netherlands had a goalless draw against hosts Spain in their opening pool match in this match Netherlands suffered injuries to some of its key players. Pakistan got the lead in the match three times through Tanvir Dar who scored all three goals from short corners but every time Netherlands managed to reply back within few minutes from conceding. First it was Nico Spits who equalized in the thirteenth minute making the score 1-1 then again Spits combined with a move from Ties Kruize leveled the score again in the forty eighth minute. Near the last minutes of the game Dar scored his hat-trick to put Pakistan ahead for the third time but Netherlands scored within the last five minutes from a short corner through Paul Litjens. The pulsating match was one of the best in the tournaments and Netherlands were lauded for their performance for keeping an unparalleled Pakistan team on bay despite not playing with their full strength squad. \n1978 World Cup Final.\nPakistan and Netherlands met in the World Cup final for the first time in the fourth World Cup in Buenos Aires, 1978. Pakistan had earlier beaten Netherlands 3–1 in a pool match and were unbeaten in the tournament. From a tense battle of skill and attrition, Pakistan emerged 3-2 winners over Netherlands in the final. Pakistan scored first through Akhtar Rasool from a penalty comer but the Dutch soon equalized with Ties Kruise converting a penalty stroke. Early in the second half, Paul Litjens scored for Netherlands from a long comer but Pakistan battled for the equalizer eventually to obtain it through lslahuddin from a scramble. A late matchwinner was obtained by Rana Ehsanullah from a penalty comer. So, Pakistan became the first team to win the cup for the second time, with the record of eight wins in eight matches for a total of thirty five goals.\n1982 Champions Trophy.\nThe third edition of the Hockey Champions Trophy was held in Amstelveen, Netherlands. Pakistan were also the reigning World Champions winning the 1982 World Cup in Mumbai and the Asian Cup on home soil months later. They had lost only once in 23 matches before the match Pakistan and Netherlands were the only team in position to win the tournament. Netherlands went on to win the match by scoring seven goals. At half-time Netherlands had a 4–1 lead Ties Kruize twice from the short-corner, Tom Van't Hek and Roderik Bouwman scored once to give Netherlands a 4–0 lead within twenty six minutes. Pakistan scored through Hassan Sardar two minutes before half-time to reduce the margin. Kruize maintained his excellent form in the second half scoring a hat-trick in the second half only scoring five goals in total and giving his team a resounding 7–2 victory, defending their title from a year earlier. Pakistan eventually slumped to fourth place with this defeat.\n1990 World Cup Final.\nOn 23 February 1990 a crowd of nearly 70,000 witnessed the Seventh World Cup final between Pakistan and Netherlands at the National Hockey Stadium at Lahore. In the throbbing final scene there could hardly have been a better start for Pakistan than a goal In the fifth minute by Shahbaz Ahmed who picked up a center from Farhat Khan and gave the goalkeeper Frank Leistra no chance from close range. The stands erupted and the chanting spurred Pakistan on to greater endeavour. But the roar was reduced to a whisper when Tom Van't Hek forced a penalty corner in the twelfth minute and a silence followed when Floris Jan Bovelander landed a stunning shot on the target. Two minutes later Netherlands was awarded another penalty comer and Bovelander's shot glanced off the front foot of the goalkeeper Mansoor Ahmed to soar into the net. In the last ten minutes before the interval Pakistan's forwards doubled their effort with Tahir Zaman and Shahbaz putting the Dutch defence under pressure, but two minutes into the second half. Weterings at outside left. seized on a center by Marc Delissen and drove an unstoppable shot into the goal. Netherlands won the match 3–1, their second title after 1973.\n1992 Olympic bronze medal.\nPakistan and Netherlands progressed for the semifinals from their group for the 1992 Olympics in Terrassa. Pakistan defeated Netherlands 3–2 to top the group but both teams lost the semifinals, Australia defeated Netherlands 3-2 and Pakistan lost to Germany in extra time. This made for another match between the two for the bronze medal, it was the third time both played each other in a medal match at the Olympics each time for a bronze medal. The Dutch were 2-0 up against Pakistan in the men's bronze medal match. However, smarting from losing to Germany in the semi-finals and being seen somewhat as the ‘people's favourite’ for the title, Pakistan succeeded with a superb late fightback. Pakistan rallied to score four goals in the last fifteen minutes to cap a sensational fightback, winning 4–3. Netherlands looked to be in control after taking a 2–0 lead with goals by Marc Delissen and Stephan Veen. Only eighteen minutes were left when Pakistan struck two telling blows with goals by Muhammad Shahbaz and Khalid Bashir from a penalty corners. The flames of interest were kindled a new and Pakistan went ahead when Qamar Ibrahim scored. Khalid crashed home another goal from a penalty corner for a 4 -2 lead and in the dying seconds Gijs Weterings. the Dutch outside left brought a bizarre match to a close by cutting Pakistan's advantage to 4–3. Shahbaz Ahmed was instrumental in the play creating many chances of which Pakistan scored the much needed goals. \n1994 World Cup Final.\nPakistan and Netherlands again met in the World Cup final in 1994 at Sydney. Pakistan held such command in the second half but match ended a draw and penalty strokes were imposed. Three chances were missed in quick succession by Tahir Zaman, Kamran Ashraf and Asif Bajwa. The scoring was done in the first half Bovelander putting Netherlands ahead in the seventeenth minute but the lead lasted only four minutes with Kamran deflecting a shot by Asif Bajwa into the net. Netherlands was awarded a goal claimed to have been scored by Delissen from a long corner. But the Spanish umpire Santiago Deo intervened explaining that the ball had been deflected into the goal by a Pakistani defender's stick and the Australian umpire Don Prior reversed his decision. The match ended 1-1, In the penalty shoot-out Mansoor Ahmed first saved a shot of Bovelander putting Muhammad Shafqat Malik of Pakistan to score from his stroke and win the World Cup for Pakistan but he missed. The following shot Mansoor again made the decisive save off Jeroen Delmee as he had done in the semi-final against Germany. Pakistan won their record fourth title, Shahbaz Ahmed was voted as player of the tournament for the second straight edition. Hundreds of Pakistan supporters poured on to the Homebush pitch proclaiming Pakistan as champions again."

        "title": "1940 NCAA basketball championship game",
        "text": "The 1940 NCAA Basketball Championship Game was the final of the 1940 NCAA basketball tournament and determined the national champion in the 1939–40 NCAA men's basketball season. The game was held at the Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri, on March 30, 1940. The Indiana Hoosiers defeated the Kansas Jayhawks 60–42 to win the school's first national championship in men's basketball.\nBackground.\nIndiana.\nThe Hoosiers' head coach was Branch McCracken, who was in his second season on the job. In the previous season, 1938–39, Indiana had a 9–3 record in Big Ten Conference play, second behind Ohio State. On December 9, 1939, the Hoosiers opened the season with a 13-point win over Wabash; two days later, they routed Xavier 58–24. They finished 1939 unbeaten at 7–0, with their closest game a two-point victory over Duquesne. On January 6, 1940, the Hoosiers played their first Big Ten game of the season against Illinois, winning 38–36 in a contest that came down to the closing moments. After a 45–40 win over Iowa, the Hoosiers suffered their first loss of the season, falling to Minnesota 46–44. The team bounced back with victories over Wisconsin and DePaul, before a 46–39 win over Purdue on February 10 which gave the Hoosiers a share of first place in the conference. Although Indiana subsequently defeated Michigan by 27 points, the club lost two of its next four games, to Northwestern and Ohio State. However, the Hoosiers ended their regular season by beating Purdue again and one of the teams they had lost to, Ohio State.\nIndiana finished the regular season 17–3 and 9–3 in Big Ten play, one game behind conference winner Purdue; however, Purdue did not receive an NCAA Tournament invitation. While reports have indicated that a bid was declined by Boilermakers coach Ward Lambert, selection committee member Tony Hinkle said years after the event that Indiana was selected to appear in the tournament because the school was considered the \"most representative team\" in the Midwest. The invitation was approved by Indiana's faculty athletics committee, after McCracken supported appearing in the event. In the quarterfinals of the eight-team NCAA Tournament, the Hoosiers faced Springfield, winning 48–24. Herm Schaefer scored 14 of the 48 Hoosier points, and Springfield was held to 13% shooting in the game. That result earned them a berth in the Final Four, in which Duquesne was their opponent; the Dukes had already had a runner-up finish in the 1940 National Invitation Tournament. By a 39–30 score, Indiana defeated Duquesne to earn a spot in the championship game. Bill Menke had a team-high 10 points for the Hoosiers.\nKansas.\nPhog Allen was the coach of the Jayhawks; he was in his 23rd season in the role across two stints. In the 1938–39 season, Kansas had a 6–4 record in conference play, and was 13–7 overall. The Jayhawks' first game of the season was a 34–30 win over Oklahoma A&amp;M on December 5; three days later, they lost in overtime at Warrensburg. Following that defeat, the Jayhawks won their next eight games, including two victories over SMU and a 46–26 win over Oklahoma on January 5. On January 18, Missouri dealt the Jayhawks a 42–31 defeat; the team responded with wins over Nebraska and Iowa State, before a loss to Oklahoma A&amp;M. Kansas then won their next four games, before defeats to Creighton and Oklahoma that ended the regular season. The Jayhawks faced Oklahoma again in a conference playoff game, winning 45–39.\nKansas was placed in the West region of the NCAA Tournament, with their first game against Rice. The Jayhawks took a 10-point lead into halftime and held on to win 50–44. With 21 points, Howard Engleman was responsible for nearly half of the Jawhawks' total output. Kansas then faced USC in the regional final. In a closely contested game, the Jayhawks advanced with a 43–42 victory. Richard Harp led Kansas with 15 points.\nGame summary.\nThe 1940 national championship game ended the first NCAA men's basketball tournament administered by the organization, after the 1939 event was run by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC). After the inaugural tournament lost money for the NABC, the group gave the rights to hold the event to the NCAA in exchange for the organization taking on the debt and giving NABC coaches future championship game tickets. The game was held on March 30, 1940, at the Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri; the same arena also hosted the national title game in the following two years. The audience was mainly composed of Jayhawks fans, as the arena was approximately 40 miles from Kansas' campus. The game attracted a crowd of approximately 10,000 people, who paid a reported total of $8,509 for their tickets. Along with the previous rounds, the revenue from the final more than covered the debt from 1939. Prior to the encounter, a ceremony was held to honor James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, who had died in November 1939.\nIndiana won the opening tip, but was unable to score despite gathering two offensive rebounds. Kansas was also held scoreless on their first possession after a missed free throw. The Hoosiers' Curly Armstrong registered the first point with a made free throw two minutes into the game. At the start of the encounter, Kansas sought to slow down the Hoosiers by utilizing an attacking defense aimed at forcing Indiana's ball-handlers towards the center of the court. The strategy proved effective, as the Hoosiers were held without a field goal for the first eight minutes. The teams traded scores during the early play. Five minutes into the game, the Jayhawks had tallied 10 points and held the lead. Baskets by Marvin Huffman, Jay McCreary, and Bob Dro brought the Hoosiers to an 11–11 tie and forced a timeout by the Jayhawks. Afterwards, the Hoosiers took control of the contest with a faster-paced offense than Kansas. Indiana tied the game at 11, behind the efforts of reserve McCreary, Huffman, and Dro, and had the better of the play for the rest of the period. Although they held a slim 17–14 lead with seven minutes left in the first half, the Hoosiers outscored the Jayhawks 15–5 during the rest of the period, using a quick-tempo offense that led USC head coach Sam Barry to say following the contest, \"I knew Indiana was fast, but not that fast.\" At the end of the first half, the Hoosiers held a 32–19 advantage.\nIn the second half, Phog Allen's son, Bob, attempted to help Kansas remain competitive with five field goals and a pair of made free throws to lead the Jayhawks. However, the Jayhawks were affected by the quick offensive attacks of the Hoosiers, which led to a large number of fouls. By the start of the half, Ralph Miller had already accumulated four personal fouls. The Hoosiers also ran into foul trouble, as Huffman and Dro both reached four fouls for the game. McCreary paced the Hoosiers' offense in the second half, recording 10 points. Allen was forced out of the game after a hard landing on the floor, although he eventually returned. Indiana expanded its lead slightly in the half and won, 60–42, to claim the national championship. McCracken accepted the championship trophy from Oregon head coach Howard Hobson, whose team had won the previous year's title. Huffman was selected as the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nStatistical summary.\nThe Hoosiers made 26 field goals in the game, out of 74 attempts, and converted on eight of their eleven free throw attempts. Huffman and McCreary each scored 12 points to lead the Hoosiers. Armstrong added 10 points, while Herman Schaefer had 9 and Dro tallied 7. For the Jayhawks, Allen contributed 13 points, making him the game's leading scorer. Engleman had 12 points, but no other Kansas player had more than 5 points. Kansas made 15 field goals, 11 fewer than Indiana, and missed eight of 20 free throw tries, along with over 60 field goal attempts. The teams combined to commit a total of 30 personal fouls, 19 of which were committed by the Hoosiers. The accumulation of fouls led to the disqualification of three players.\nAftermath.\nIn the following season, Indiana had a record of 17–3, with a 10–2 mark in conference play. This left the Hoosiers in second place, one game behind Wisconsin. The 1940 national championship game was the first of six appearances in the NCAA Tournament final for the Hoosiers, and the first of five times they won the title. The team did not return to the NCAA Tournament until 1953, when they won their second championship under McCracken.\nKansas' appearance in the 1940 national championship game was the first of nine in the program's history. The Jayhawks posted a 12–6 record in 1940–41, and their 7–3 Big Six record tied them for first in the conference with Iowa State. However, the team did not receive an NCAA Tournament invitation. Kansas returned to the event in 1942, but lost in the regional semifinals. Under Allen, the Jayhawks made two further title game appearances, and in 1952 won the championship for the first time."

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, January 29, 2022, at The Dome at America's Center in St. Louis, Missouri, and was the first Royal Rumble to livestream on Peacock. It was also WWE's first PPV to be livestreamed on Disney+ Hotstar in Indonesia.\nTraditionally, the Royal Rumble match winner receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2022 event, the winners of both the men's and women's matches received a choice of which championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 38. The men could choose to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship or SmackDown's Universal Championship, while the women had the choice between the Raw Women's Championship and the SmackDown Women's Championship. NXT's men's and women's championships were dropped from the options after NXT reverted to being WWE's developmental territory in September 2021.\nSix matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Brock Lesnar won the men's Royal Rumble match after losing his WWE Championship to Bobby Lashley earlier in the night, becoming the first former world champion to win the eponymous match on the same night he lost the title. This also made him the ninth two-time Royal Rumble winner, first winning it in 2003, and he set a record for the longest time between Royal Rumble wins (19 years) as well as the least time spent in the match before winning it (2:30). The women's Royal Rumble match was won by Ronda Rousey, in her first WWE appearance since WrestleMania 35 in April 2019. In the opening bout, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins defeated Universal Champion Roman Reigns by disqualification; however, as titles do not change hands by disqualification unless stipulated, Reigns retained. Notably, \"Jackass\" actor/stuntman Johnny Knoxville and reggaeton singer Bad Bunny appeared in the men's Royal Rumble and reigning Impact Knockouts World Champion Mickie James appeared in the women's. This was also the final WWE event for Spanish commentator Carlos Cabrera.\nThe event received negative reviews from fans and critics, with the men's Royal Rumble being widely panned, while the women's Royal Rumble criticized for its ending. Despite this, however, the match between Rollins and Reigns was widely praised.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick event produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, originally dubbed the \"Big Four\", and as of August 2021, it is considered one of the \"Big Five\", along with Money in the Bank. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time.\nAnnounced on September 27, 2021, the 2022 event was the 35th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on Saturday, January 29 at The Dome at America's Center in St. Louis, Missouri. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. In addition to airing on pay-per-view worldwide and the WWE Network in international markets, it was the first Royal Rumble to livestream on Peacock after the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March 2021. Additionally, this was WWE's first pay-per-view to livestream on Disney+ Hotstar in Indonesia, as it was announced that The Walt Disney Company and WWE inked a multi-year deal to make Disney+ Hotstar as its exclusive home for WWE Network in Indonesia on January 27. Tickets went on sale on October 15 through Ticketmaster.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania.\nFor 2022, the men and women could choose which world championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 38; the men could choose Raw's WWE Championship or SmackDown's Universal Championship, while the women could choose the Raw Women's Championship or SmackDown Women's Championship. In September 2021, NXT was rebranded as \"NXT 2.0\" and reverted to being WWE's developmental territory. While NXT's championships—the NXT Championship and NXT Women's Championship—were eligible choices for the Rumble winners in 2020 and 2021, they were not eligible choices for the 2022 Royal Rumble.\nStorylines.\nThe event included six matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nAt Day 1, \"Jackass\" actor and stuntman Johnny Knoxville announced that he would be participating in the men's Royal Rumble match. On the following \"SmackDown\", Sami Zayn encountered Knoxville backstage and claimed that Knoxville was not qualified to compete in the Royal Rumble match, nor did he earn the opportunity to be in it. After Zayn lost his match that night, Knoxville ran down to the ring and threw Zayn over the top rope. Ring announcer Mike Rome then announced that Knoxville had officially qualified for the Royal Rumble match, much to Zayn's displeasure.\nOn the January 7 episode of \"SmackDown\", SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair revealed 18 of the women who would be competing in the women's Royal Rumble match, including WWE Hall of Famers and veterans, and notably, reigning Impact Knockouts World Champion Mickie James, marking the first time WWE openly acknowledged one of Impact's championships on their canonical programming. Additionally, Flair declared that she would also participate in the match, stating that she would be the first reigning women's champion to win the Royal Rumble. While the winner traditionally earns a championship match at WrestleMania, Flair stated she would instead select her WrestleMania 38 opponent if she won.\nAt Day 1, Brock Lesnar defeated Bobby Lashley, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, Kevin Owens, and defending champion Big E in a fatal five-way match to win Raw's WWE Championship; this was originally scheduled as a fatal four-way match, but Lesnar was added due to his scheduled match against SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns being canceled as Reigns tested positive for COVID-19. On the following episode of \"Raw\", Lesnar reunited with Paul Heyman, who announced that Lesnar's first challenger for the title would be determined by a fatal four-way match between Big E, Lashley, Owens, and Rollins. Lashley won the bout to face Lesnar for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble.\nOn the January 7 episode of \"SmackDown\", as Roman Reigns did not have a challenger for his Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble, WWE official Adam Pearce informed Reigns that he had selected his opponent. Reigns dismissed Pearce, stating he had already defeated everyone on the SmackDown roster. Later that night, Raw's Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins confronted Reigns in his locker room, laughing hysterically at Reigns, seemingly confirming he was Pearce's selection. On the January 10 episode of \"Raw\", Rollins confirmed that he would be challenging Reigns for the Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble in an interbrand matchup. On the January 21 episode of \"SmackDown\", Rollins and Kevin Owens defeated The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) by disqualification thanks to interference from Reigns, thus barring The Usos from ringside during the Universal Championship match as per the stipulation; had Rollins and Owens lost, Rollins would have forfeited his championship opportunity.\nAt Day 1, Beth Phoenix appeared to aid her husband and fellow WWE Hall of Famer, Edge, when he was being attacked by Maryse while he was engaged in a match with The Miz; Edge ultimately won the match. On the following \"Raw\", Miz and Maryse berated Edge and Phoenix, with the latter challenging Miz and Maryse to a mixed tag team match at the Royal Rumble. Miz accepted, despite Maryse's displeasure.\nAt Day 1, Becky Lynch defeated Liv Morgan to retain the Raw Women's Championship. On the following \"Raw\", Morgan confronted Lynch, wanting another rematch. Bianca Belair interrupted, also wanting a championship match due to her unsettled rivalry with Lynch that began at the 2021 SummerSlam. A brawl then ensued. Later backstage, Doudrop confronted WWE officials Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville, demanding a title match herself as she was tired of Belair and Morgan always receiving opportunities. Pearce and Deville scheduled a triple threat match between Belair, Morgan, and Doudrop for the following week with the winner facing Lynch for the Raw Women's Championship at the Royal Rumble. The match was won by Doudrop, thanks to Lynch attacking Belair.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe pay-per-view opened with Roman Reigns defending the Universal Championship against Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, with The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) barred from ringside. Reigns entered first, followed by Rollins, who came out to The Shield's former entrance theme and gear and walking in through the crowd to taunt Reigns. Rollins drove Reigns through the announce table with a Powerbomb. Rollins followed up with a Frog Splash on Reigns for a nearfall. Rollins attempted a Phoenix Splash, but Reigns moved out of the way. Rollins intercepted a Spear attempt and followed up with a Buckle Bomb and The Stomp on Reigns for a nearfall. Rollins attempted a second Stomp, but Reigns turned him inside out with a clothesline. Reigns performed a Powerbomb on Rollins for a nearfall. Rollins applied a triangle choke, only for Reigns to counter into another Powerbomb. Outside the ring, Reigns sent Rollins into the timekeeper's area and into the steel ring steps. Reigns followed up with a Superman Punch on Rollins for a nearfall. Reigns then performed a Spear on Rollins outside the ring and looked to do so again back inside, but Rollins countered the move into a Pedigree on Reigns for a nearfall. In the closing moments, Reigns performed a second Spear on Rollins, who offered a fist bump to Reigns. Reigns then applied the guillotine choke on Rollins, who grabbed the rope to void the submission; however, Reigns refused to release Rollins and was disqualified. Rollins won the match but Reigns retained the title, as they do not change hands by disqualification unless stipulated. Following the match, Reigns viciously assaulted Rollins with a steel chair.\nThe second match was the women's Royal Rumble match for a women's championship match at WrestleMania 38. Sasha Banks started the match along with Melina, in her first WWE match since 2011. Banks eliminated Melina early, after which, Tamina entered at #3 followed by Kelly Kelly. Kelly was eliminated by Banks, as well. Aliyah entered at #5, followed by Liv Morgan. One half of the WWE Women's Tag Team Champions, Queen Zelina (#7), kicked Banks through the ropes to eliminate her. Afterwards, Bianca Belair (#8) performed a vertical suplex on Zelina before 24/7 Champion Dana Brooke entered 9th. Michelle McCool entered 10th and sent Brooke off the ring apron. Reggie was able to save Brooke from elimination, only for McCool to knock Brooke off the top rope to eliminate her. Instead of entering in the match, Sonya Deville (#11) sat at commentary. Natalya (#12) sent both Belair and Tamina over the top rope, with the latter's feet touching the floor. Cameron, in her first WWE appearance since 2016, entered at #13. Deville then officially entered the match and eliminated Cameron, due to her ties with Naomi, who Deville had been feuding with on \"SmackDown\". Naomi entered at #14 and eliminated Deville. The other half of the WWE Women's Tag Team Champions, Carmella (#15), took a stroll around the ring before Rhea Ripley (#16) eliminated both Carmella and Zelina. SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair (#17) dominated the field, including eliminating Aliyah, and kicked Naomi off the apron, but Naomi was able to use her hands to prevent elimination. However, Deville pulled Naomi off the apron for an elimination. Ivory entered at #18 in her Right to Censor gimmick and was quickly eliminated by Ripley. Brie Bella (#19) entered next followed by Impact Knockouts World Champion Mickie James, who eliminated McCool. Alicia Fox was a surprise entrant at #21. Nikki A.S.H. (#22) attacked her former tag team partner, Ripley, from behind and attempted to eliminate her, but Ripley prevented it. Summer Rae (#23), who appeared on \"SmackDown\" prior to the event, returned to the ring for the first time in over 6 years and reignited her rivalry with Natalya, who eliminated her. Nikki Bella (#24) teamed with Brie to eliminate Fox. Sarah Logan was another surprise entrant at #25, but was quickly eliminated by The Bella Twins (Nikki and Brie), who eliminated Morgan shortly afterwards. Lita (#26) performed a DDT on James through the ropes to eliminate her. Mighty Molly (#27) was blindsided by A.S.H., who eliminated Molly. Afterwards, Ronda Rousey made a surprise return at #28, her first appearance since WrestleMania 35 in April 2019. Rousey eliminated A.S.H., followed by Brie eliminating Nikki. Shotzi entered at #29 and dove onto the other opponents before Rousey eliminated Brie. Shayna Baszler entered last. Rousey eliminated Shotzi followed by Natalya, who reentered the ring, only to be sent over the top rope by Rousey again. Lita attempted a Moonsault, but Ripley cut her off, followed by Flair eliminating Lita. Flair then performed a Big Boot on Ripley to eliminate her. The final four were Flair, Rousey, Belair, and Baszler. Belair and Baszler were both eliminated by Flair. As Flair tried to eliminate Rousey, Rousey caught Flair and eliminated her to win the match and earn a women's championship opportunity at WrestleMania 38.\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Doudrop. In the end, Lynch performed the Manhandle Slam from the top rope on Doudrop to retain the title.\nIn the fourth match, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the WWE Championship against Bobby Lashley (accompanied by MVP). At the start of the match, Lesnar and Lashley performed German suplexes on each other. Lashley delivered two Spears on Lesnar, who rolled outside the ring. As Lashley attempted to perform a spear on Lesnar through the barricade as he did at Day 1, Lesnar moved out of the way and Lashley crashed through the barricade. Back in the ring, Lesnar performed multiple German suplexes on Lashley. As Lashley applied in the Hurt Lock, Lesnar tried to free himself by pushing Lashley into a turnbuckle, inadvertently incapacitating the referee. Lesnar performed an F-5 on Lashley, who accidentally incapacitated the referee again. In the climax, Roman Reigns entered the ring and performed a spear on Lesnar. Reigns signaled for Heyman to hand him the WWE Championship belt which he did, double crossing Lesnar. Reigns then struck Lesnar over the head with the belt after which, Heyman walked off with Reigns, thus realigning with Reigns once again as his special counsel. Lashley pinned Lesnar to win the title for a second time.\nIn the penultimate match, Edge and Beth Phoenix took on The Miz and Maryse in a mixed tag team match. During the match, while the referee was focused on The Miz, Maryse struck Phoenix from behind with her purse for a nearfall and also managed to perform a Hurricanrana on Edge from the top rope. The Miz performed the Skull Crushing Finale on Edge for a nearfall. In the end, Edge and Phoenix performed a double Spear on The Miz and performed a pair of Glam Slams on The Miz and Maryse to win the match.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the men's Royal Rumble match for a men's world championship match at WrestleMania 38. AJ Styles and Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura started the match. Austin Theory entered at #3, followed by Robert Roode, who was eliminated by Styles. Ridge Holland entered his first Royal Rumble match at #5, after which, Styles eliminated Nakamura. Montez Ford (#6) attempted to eliminate Theory, who prevented elimination. Afterwards, United States Champion Damian Priest entered at #7. Johnny Knoxville entered at #9 and went after Sami Zayn (#8). After Knoxville took a couple of finishers from other wrestlers, he was eliminated by Zayn, who was then eliminated by Styles. After Angelo Dawkins entered at #10, Omos entered at #11 and eliminated The Street Profits (Dawkins and Ford) and Priest before being eliminated by Styles, Theory, Raw Tag Team Champion Chad Gable (#13), Dominik Mysterio (#14), Ricochet (#12), and Holland. Happy Corbin (#15) managed to eliminate Ricochet before Dolph Ziggler entered at #16. Afterwards, Corbin performed a Deep Six on Dominik before eliminating him. Styles then eliminated Theory. After Styles eliminated Holland, Sheamus (#17) went right after Styles before Rick Boogs (#18) eliminated Gable. Corbin then teamed with Madcap Moss (#19) to eliminate Styles. After Riddle entered at #20, Corbin and Moss eliminated Boogs before Drew McIntyre made a surprise return from injury at #21 and eliminated Corbin and Moss as revenge for them injuring him a few weeks earlier. Kevin Owens (#22) had a showdown with McIntyre, with Owens getting the better of it before Rey Mysterio entered at #23. Rey almost eliminated Riddle, but was laid out with a Stunner by Owens. Kofi Kingston (#24) went for a springboard move, but was shoved off the top rope by Owens. Kingston attempted to land on the outside barricade, but both feet accidentally hit the floor, resulting in his elimination. The other half of the Raw Tag Team Champions, Otis (#25), dominated Ziggler, McIntyre, and Riddle before Big E entered at #26. In his first appearance since WrestleMania 37 the previous year, reggaeton singer Bad Bunny entered at #27 as a surprise entrant. Bad Bunny performed a Destroyer on Riddle before being sent over the top rope by Sheamus. Bad Bunny avoided a Brogue Kick attempt, causing Sheamus to be eliminated. After Rey performed a 619 on Ziggler, Bad Bunny eliminated Ziggler. Shane McMahon, also in his first appearance since WrestleMania 37, entered at #28 as a surprise entrant. At the same time, Otis eliminated Rey. Shane eliminated Owens before Randy Orton entered at #29. RK-Bro (Orton and Riddle) teamed up to eliminate Big E and Otis. Brock Lesnar then entered as the surprise #30 entrant and dominated everyone before eliminating Orton. Lesnar then performed an F-5 on Bad Bunny before eliminating him, bringing the final four to Lesnar, McIntyre, McMahon, and Riddle. Lesnar eliminated Riddle and McMahon before having a staredown with McIntyre, the same man who eliminated Lesnar in and won the men's Royal Rumble match two years earlier. The two traded blows, with Lesnar driving McIntyre in the corner. Lesnar attempted an F-5, but McIntyre countered and performed a Glasgow Kiss. McIntyre attempted a Claymore Kick, but Lesnar blocked and followed up with an F-5 over the top rope on McIntyre to win the match and earn a world championship match at WrestleMania 38, becoming the fourth person to win from the No. 30 spot (after The Undertaker in 2007, John Cena in 2008, and Triple H in 2016). This made Lesnar the ninth two-time Royal Rumble winner, his first win being in 2003. This also made him the first person to lose their world championship and then win the eponymous match in the same night. Among the other multi-time Royal Rumble winners, Lesnar also set a record for the longest time between Royal Rumble wins at 19 years. He also set the record for the least amount of time spent in the Royal Rumble before winning it. He was in the match for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, beating Edge's 2010 record by 5 minutes and 7 seconds.\nReception.\nThe men's Royal Rumble match was widely panned by fans due to what they felt was a lack of surprises and star-power, with some listing it among the worst Royal Rumble matches in WWE history. Writing for \"Sports Illustrated\", Bryan Alvarez described the match as \"boring\", calling it a \"pretty by-the-numbers generic Rumble\" as \"the most notable thing about the match was how quickly they were rushing everything to get the show off the air by midnight ET even though the history of the Royal Rumble has shown that fudging the intervals is not something WWE has ever avoided, and doing it here would have left more time for the big moments at the end.\"\nWesley Roesch of \"Wrestling Inc.\" ranked this Royal Rumble as the worst WWE pay-per-view of 2022. He said that the best match was the Reigns-Rollins match, stating that Rollins using The Shield's entrance music and gear was \"genius and hyped the crowd,\" but said that the ending was \"disappointing\" and that there was \"ultimately no payoff with the feud.\" He also stated that the mixed tag team match and the Raw Women's Championship match were \"solid filler matches but nothing special,\" and that Ronda Rousey was \"a predictable winner\" for the women's Royal Rumble match. Roesch stated that Paul Heyman joining Roman Reigns was \"a nice twist,\" but Brock Lesnar's loss to Bobby Lashley led to the men's Royal Rumble match being \"the most disappointing match of the night,\" stating that once Lesnar lost to Lashley, \"everyone knew that Lesnar would enter and win the Royal Rumble,\" which he described as having \"a lack of surprises and dull or botched spots,\" making that match \"one of the worst in years.\"\nBrent Brookhouse of \"CBS Sports\" gave praise to the Universal Championship match, giving it a grade of A−, stating that the match was \"outstanding,\" but the finish was \"polarizing but it does a lot of things well,\" and Rollins \"stays as a fresh and compelling challenger moving forward since he didn't eat a clean loss.\" He gave the women's Royal Rumble match a grade of C, stating that the match was \"a bit clunky with too many women who aren't used to working together all getting stuck in the match and slowing things down,\" and that it was \"the worst women's Royal Rumble since the start of holding the matches.\" Brookhouse also gave praise to the WWE Championship match, stating that it was \"very good and very physical stuff from Lesnar and Lashley, who did not disappoint,\" but panned the men's Royal Rumble match, giving it a grade of F, stating that the match was an \"unmitigated disaster,\" and that it \"easily ranks among the five worst of all time, if not lower.\" He said that \"the match dragged badly and the crowd was lost because of it -- and further lost when Kingston's big spot went wrong.\" Finally, he stated that \"McMahon and Bad Bunny in the final five is just the wrong call beyond any doubt.\"\nChris Mueller of \"Bleacher Report\" gave the Universal Championship match a grade of A, stating that \"Rollins using his Shield gear and entrance music was a brilliant way to bring him into this match and get the crowd in the right mindset for the night,\" and that the disqualification ending \"actually worked for the story being told, especially if this feud is going to continue past the Rumble.\" He said that the women's Royal Rumble match had \"some fun spots and featured standout moments for several competitors,\" but it was \"disappointing we didn't get to see Bayley or anyone from NXT like Io Shirai or Dakota Kai.\" Mueller praised the WWE Championship match, giving it a grade of B+, stating that the match was \"exactly what it needed to be,\" that being \"two big dudes throwing each other around and beating each other up.\" He stated that the finish was \"convoluted and is one issue some will call out, but this gave Lashley back the WWE title and set up Lesnar vs. Reigns down the line,\" and that it \"was a fun way to accomplish two things at once.\" Mueller criticized the men's Royal Rumble match, giving it a grade of C−, stating that it \"never quite hit its stride,\" and that \"the crowd was clearly tired and WWE has changed quite a lot of entrance themes lately, so there weren't too many big pops to be heard.\" He also stated that Kofi Kingston's failed save \"deflated things even further,\" and that after Lesnar lost the WWE Championship, \"speculation about him winning the men's Rumble began to run rampant on social media.\" Mueller said that another person could have won the match and Lesnar still could have faced Reigns at WrestleMania 38, but WWE management \"clearly thought this was the right call.\" He concluded that the event \"fell a bit short for such an important show.\"\nThe highest rated match on the card, according to Dave Meltzer, was the Universal Championship match, which received 3.5 stars. The WWE Championship match received 3.25 stars, the mixed tag team match received 2.75 stars, and the Raw Women's Championship match and the Royal Rumble matches all received 2.25 stars.\nAftermath.\nOn the following episode of \"Raw\", Ronda Rousey pondered which title to challenge for as she had heated history with both reigning champions. After Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch confronted Rousey and demanded she make her choice that night, Rousey responded that she would reveal her choice on \"SmackDown\". There, Rousey announced that she would challenge Charlotte Flair for the SmackDown Women's Championship at WrestleMania 38.\nThis ended up being the last WWE event for Spanish commentator Carlos Cabrera, who was released on February 17. Shane McMahon was also released on February 2, but made his return at Night 2 of WrestleMania 39.\nRaw.\nAlso on the following episode of \"Raw\", Brock Lesnar revealed that he would be challenging Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship at WrestleMania 38. However, he also challenged Bobby Lashley to a rematch for the WWE Championship that night due to the controversial finish of their Royal Rumble match. Lashley declined, however, WWE official Adam Pearce added Lesnar to the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins was also added to the Chamber match due to technically defeating Reigns at the Royal Rumble. Lesnar won the Elimination Chamber match to regain the WWE Championship, thus converting his Universal Championship match against Reigns at WrestleMania into a Winner Takes All match, which was later stipulated as a Championship Unification match.\nAs Ronda Rousey was leaving the ring, Lita appeared and challenged Becky Lynch for the Raw Women's Championship at Elimination Chamber, which was made official.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Drew McIntyre stated he would continue to target Happy Corbin and Madcap Moss due to them almost ending his career at Day 1, and a match between Moss and McIntyre was scheduled for Elimination Chamber, which was later changed to a Falls Count Anywhere match.\nAlso on \"SmackDown\", Universal Champion Roman Reigns, Paul Heyman, and SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) opened the show. Heyman talked about his realignment with Reigns at the Royal Rumble, stating that Reigns accepting the hand of The Bloodline caused Brock Lesnar to lose his WWE Championship. Heyman then stated that the champion vs. champion match had been called off and acknowledged Reigns, only for Goldberg to interrupt. Goldberg then acknowledged Reigns, but only as his next victim. A match between the two for the Universal Championship was made official for Elimination Chamber. It was originally scheduled to take place at WrestleMania 36, with Goldberg as champion, but Reigns pulled out of the event due to concerns over COVID-19, and was replaced by Braun Strowman, who defeated Goldberg to win the title.\nSonya Deville stated that instead of Naomi facing her, Naomi would receive a SmackDown Women's Championship match against Charlotte Flair the following week, where Flair retained. Afterwards, Flair and Deville attacked Naomi until Ronda Rousey made the save. This led to a match pitting Rousey and Naomi against Deville and Flair at Elimination Chamber, which Rousey and Naomi won.\nThe following episode of \"SmackDown\" showed footage of Sami Zayn inviting himself to the red carpet premiere of \"Jackass Forever\", for which he was kicked out by Johnny Knoxville. Zayn was then informed that he would receive an Intercontinental Championship match two weeks later, where Zayn was successful in winning the title. On the February 25 episode, Knoxville invited himself to Zayn's celebration for winning the title. Knoxville challenged Zayn for the title at WrestleMania 38, which Zayn declined. The following week, during Zayn's title defense, Knoxville distracted Zayn, costing him the title. Zayn then challenged Knoxville to a match at WrestleMania 38, and Knoxville accepted. After Knoxville shared Zayn's phone number, causing a multitude of people attempting to contact Zayn, Zayn changed the stipulation to an Anything Goes match, and Knoxville accepted."

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only one event was held before the 2021 finals, with the remaining four scheduled events postponed to 2022.\nFour new venues were due to make their debuts with New York City replacing Las Vegas for the US Darts Masters, and two Australian events were moved to new cities in Wollongong and Townsville.

With all five events being cancelled, she would appear in the 2020 World Series of Darts Finals, and was invited to the Nordic Masters where she became the first woman to compete in a World Series event. After defeating Niels Heinsøe in the first round, and receiving a walkover in the quarter-final courtesy of Gerwyn Price's withdrawal, she defeated Dimitri Van den Bergh in the semi-finals. She ultimately lost the final to Michael van Gerwen as he captured his 16th World Series title.\nOn 7 April 2021, the US leg and the three Oceanic events were moved to 2022 owing to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.

The games in the second round will be played in the same order as the first, only with the court control reversed.\nThe top eight clubs qualify for the \"play-offs\".

It was the 41st edition of the event, and 53 athletes from 27 nations competed.\nThe event was won by Václav Chaloupka of the Czech Republic, competing in his first World Championships. Slovak Alexander Slafkovský won silver, matching his position from 2013 and 2017, whilst 2018 World Champion Franz Anton won bronze.\nBackground.\nReigning World Champion Cédric Joly did not have the opportunity to defend his title won in La Seu d'Urgell in 2019, after he missed out on domestic selection. World No. 1 and Tokyo bronze-medallist Sideris Tasiadis also didn't compete. Benjamin Savšek entered the event as Olympic Champion and had the opportunity to become the first male to become World and Olympic Champion in the same calendar year. Frenchman Denis Gargaud Chanut came into the event having won two World Cup rounds en route to his first overall World Cup title. Gargaud Chanut also won the European Championships this year and the 2011 World Championships on this course. Host nation Slovakia also fielded a strong team, with World No. 2 Alexander Slafkovský and No. 4 Matej Beňuš.\nCompetition format.\nThe Men's C1 event in canoe slalom uses a three-round format with heats, a semifinal and final. Athletes complete up to two runs in the heats. In the first heat, the 20 fastest men qualify automatically for the semifinal, whilst the rest complete another run in the repêchage second heat for a further 10 qualification positions. The final rank of non-qualifying athletes is determined by their second run score. Athletes start in the reverse order of their heats position in the semifinal and complete a single run, with the top 10 advancing to the final. The athlete with the best time in the single-run final is awarded gold.\nPenalties of 2 or 50 seconds are incurred for infractions such as missing a gate, touching a gate, or not negotiating gates in numerical order. A team may request up to one review of a penalty per boat in the heats or semifinals phases, with no enquiries considered in the finals.\nResults.\nHome favourite Alexander Slafkovský topped the first heat with a clean 83.96, more than 2 seconds clear of next best Olympic Champion Benjamin Savšek. Pole Kacper Sztuba won the second heat, 3.03 off Slafkovský's first run time. Martin Thomas and Raffaello Ivaldi were the two highest ranked athletes to miss out on the semifinal. 26 of the 30 who progressed to the semifinal did so with a penalty-free run.\nSavšek finished fastest in the semifinal with a time of 91.18, ahead of 2018 World Champion Franz Anton and Slafkovský.\nVáclav Chaloupka became the 2021 C1M World Champion with a clean run of 92.02, the first to become both Senior and U23 World Champion in this event. Slafkovský won silver, just 0.15 seconds behind Chaloupka due to a touch on the penultimate gate, whilst Anton won bronze. Savšek appeared set to win the event before a mistake at the bottom of the course which incurred him a 50-second penalty.\nPenalties are included in the time shown. The fastest time in each round is shown in bold."

The New Zealand XI team won both of the 50-over matches, with the third match, a 20-over encounter, abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain.\nThe one-off T20I would have been the first time that the Dutch team have played a T20I in New Zealand, and the ODIs were the first time the teams had played each other in that format since the 1996 Cricket World Cup.

New Zealand won the second ODI by 118 runs, with Tom Latham scoring his highest total in ODI cricket with an unbeaten 140 runs. New Zealand won the third and final match by 115 runs, with another century from Will Young, to take the series 3–0.\nThe series also marked the international retirement of Ross Taylor, who played in his 450th and final match for New Zealand.\nSquads.\nOn 13 March 2022, Michael Rippon was added to the Dutch squad for the tour. Ahead of the ODI series, New Zealand's Mark Chapman tested positive for COVID-19, with George Worker named as his replacement."

        "text": "The 2023 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 93rd Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held between the American League (AL) and the National League (NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). The game was played on July 11, 2023, and was televised nationally by Fox, Fox Deportes, and the Fox Sports app. The game was hosted by the Seattle Mariners at T-Mobile Park in Seattle, Washington. Philadelphia Phillies manager Rob Thomson managed the National League team, while Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker managed the American League team. The NL beat the AL, 3–2, and earned their first win since 2012.\nBackground.\nHost selection.\nThe Seattle Mariners were awarded the game on September 14, 2021. This was the third time that the Mariners hosted an All-Star Game; the previous games were in 1979 at the Kingdome and 2001 at Safeco Field, which was renamed T-Mobile Park before the 2019 season.\nTo prepare for the All-Star Game and other events, a ride-hailing lot was added to T-Mobile Park in June 2023 and repairs to escalators at International District/Chinatown station were also completed. Sound Transit, the regional transit operator, increased the frequency of Link light rail trains on the 1 Line and ran special event Sounder commuter trains for the Home Run Derby and All-Star Game. Service on the West Seattle Water Taxi was extended on event days. Fares on Sound Transit, King County Metro, and Kitsap Transit services, including buses and ferries, were also waived on July 10 and 11.\nRoster selections.\nThe starting rosters for each league's position players plus designated hitter (DH) were determined by fan balloting, which was conducted in two phases. Since 2022, the first-phase top vote-getter for each league automatically received a spot in the starting lineup. The top two vote-getters for every other non-pitching position and DH advanced to the second phase of voting. There are normally six finalists for the three outfield positions in each league, except when an outfielder is the top vote-getter, in which case there are four finalists for the remaining two outfield positions. Voting does not carry over between phases.\nFirst phase voting was held from May 1 through June 22, and second phase voting was held from June 26 through June 29. All voting was conducted online, at MLB.com or via the MLB app. Starting players, as selected via voting, were announced on June 29. Reserve position players and all pitchers—selected \"via 'Player Ballot' choices and selections made by the Commissioner’s Office\"—were announced on July 2.\nThe leading vote getter in each league during phase one was Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels and Ronald Acuña Jr. of the Atlanta Braves. Acuña received the most votes during phase one.\nLogo and uniforms.\nThe 2023 All-Star Game logo featured imagery that symbolized the Pacific Northwest, incorporating silhouettes of Mount Rainier, the Space Needle, and evergreen trees. The yellow compass between the words \"ALL\" and \"STAR\" pointed to the northwest as an allusion to Seattle's location, and the five corners were a nod to the five-state region of the Pacific Northwest. The branding is based on the Mariners' current colors of navy blue, northwest green, and silver. The uniforms for the game featured Nike's new Vapor Premier template which will be rolled out in every Major League uniform beginning in 2024. The American League wore predominantly northwest green tops with white pants, while the National League wore predominantly navy blue tops and pants; both uniforms sported \"AMERICAN\" and \"NATIONAL\" instead of each player's team wordmarks. Caps provided by the New Era Cap Company were mint with the team logos in navy blue and white, and the All-Star logo on the right side.\nRosters.\nAmerican League.\n Denotes top vote-getter in each league\nGame summary.\nLine score.\nThe Canadian national anthem was sung by country singer Tenille Townes. The American national anthem was performed by R&amp;B singer Kiana Ledé. Ken Griffey Jr. and Edgar Martínez threw ceremonial first pitches.\nIn the bottom of the second inning, Yandy Díaz hit a solo home run to lead off the American League team at 1–0. In the top of the fourth inning, Luis Arráez hit an RBI single to score J. D. Martinez to tie the National League team at one. In the bottom of the sixth inning, Salvador Pérez scored on a sacrifice fly by Bo Bichette to put the AL team in the lead at 2–1. In the top of the seventh inning, Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit a foul ball off Jordan Romano that was initially ruled a game-tying home run. The call was overturned upon review, but three pitches later, Gurriel singled off Michael Lorenzen after Romano exited with lower back tightness. Following a Geraldo Perdomo walk, Juan Soto popped out to third baseman José Ramírez, leaving the score 2–1 in the American League's favor. Elías Díaz hit a two-run home run in the top of the eighth inning to give the National League a 3–2 lead. After walking Kyle Tucker and Julio Rodríguez, Craig Kimbrel struck out José Ramírez to end the game. The National League won the All-Star Game for the first time since 2012, ending a decade-long Midsummer Classic championship drought."

The tour consisted of four Women's One Day International (WODI) matches. Originally the tour was scheduled to consist of five WODIs and three Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) matches, but a revised schedule was issued ahead of the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup.\nIn January 2022, South Africa's captain Dane van Niekerk suffered a fractured ankle, ruling her out this series and the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup. Lizelle Lee was also ruled out of South Africa's squad due to COVID-19, with Suné Luus named as the team's captain for the series in Lee's absence.\nThe first WODI match ended as a no result, with rain ending South Africa's run chase after 17.4 overs. Earlier, Deandra Dottin had made her career-best total, with 150 not out before the rain came. The second match finished in a tie, with the West Indies winning the Super Over. In the third match, Laura Wolvaardt scored a century as South Africa won by 96 runs to level the series. South Africa won the fourth and final match by six wickets to win the series 2–1. It was South Africa's fifth consecutive WODI series win, starting with a 3–0 win against New Zealand in January 2020."

With the win, Alonso become the fourth player in history to win multiple derbies and the third to win back-to-back derbies (the 2020 Home Run Derby was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic).\nRules.\nThe bracket is a single-elimination bracket with three rounds total. The higher seed in each matchup always hits second.\nThe contestants have three minutes in the first and second rounds and two minutes in the final round to hit as many home runs as possible. The timer begins with the release of the first pitch, and the round ends when the timer hits zero. A home run will count if the timer hits zero, so long as the pitch was released beforehand. If the second contestant in the matchup exceeds their opponents home run total, the round ends.\nEach contestant receives 30 seconds of bonus time after the regulation time expires. Additionally, the contestants can receive an additional 30 seconds of bonus time if they hit at least one home run that equals or exceeds during regulation. Each contestant is entitled to one 45-second timeout in each regulation period. Timeouts cannot be called during bonus time.\nTies in any round are broken by a 60-second tiebreaker with no bonus time or timeouts. If a tie remains, the contestants will engage in successive three-swing swing-offs until there is a winner.\nAs with 2019, the prize pool for the contestants totals $2.5 million, with the winner receiving $1 million of that total.\nBracket.\nWashington Nationals outfielder Juan Soto, Colorado Rockies shortstop Trevor Story, Baltimore Orioles first baseman Trey Mancini, New York Mets first baseman Pete Alonso, Kansas City Royals catcher Salvador Pérez, Oakland Athletics first baseman Matt Olson, Texas Rangers outfielder Joey Gallo and Los Angeles Angels two-way player Shohei Ohtani had been selected to participate in the derby. Alonso set a new first round record with 35 home runs in the first round. Ohtani and Soto went to a swing-off in the first round after tying with six home runs in the tie breaker. Soto prevailed by a score of 3-0 after Ohtani failed to hit a home run with his first swing."

The WT20I Series took place in Melbourne with all matches being played at Junction Oval in St. Kilda\nNew Zealand won the first WODI, with captain Suzie Bates scoring her 3rd century in WODIs. Australia came back to win the following three matches, winning the series 3-1, making it their 4th consecutive Rose Bowl victory. The WT20I series was won by New Zealand 2-1. After New Zealand won the first game by 6 wickets, Australia then levelled the series 1 all following a last-over victory. New Zealand went on to win the final game by 7 wickets and hence win the series. \nSquads.\nAustralia's Jess Jonassen was ruled out of the three-match T20I, due to a knee injury and hence was also ruled out of the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup that was to be held later that year.

He played for Illawarra and Canberra in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition.\nPlaying career.\n1982.\nIn 1982, 21-year-old Elliott made his professional football debut with the Illawarra Steelers in Round 23 against the Canberra Raiders (the team he would later player most of his career for). Illawarra lost that game 19–26, after leading by 2 at the half-time break. The Steelers, at the time, were playing their first ever season, along with the Raiders. Elliott would play for the Steelers for the last 3 rounds of the season, eventually starting his first game as a second-rower in a Round 25 match-up against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. Illawarra finished second from last and did not qualify for the postseason.\n1983.\nElliott signed with Canberra (the holders of the wooden spoon the previous year) in 1983. He played his first game with the club off the bench in a Round 9 loss against the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. He became a regular starter at second row for Canberra after Round 14 (which was coincidentally against his former club the Steelers). The Canberra side finished 10th for the season.\n1984.\nHe scored his first career try against the Western Suburbs Magpies in Round 2 in 1984. Elliott's try helped the Canberra side defeat Western Suburbs 22–12. 12 rounds later, Elliott scored his final try of the season against Cronulla. The Canberra side finished 6th, qualifying for the finals in the first time in club history. Their postseason campaign didn't last long however, as they lost to the South Sydney Rabbitohs 23–4. Elliott concluded the season with two tries from 20 appearances.\n1985.\n1985 saw a successful year for Elliott, despite playing fewer minutes and being relegated from his starting role. In Round 16, he scored in a lopsided 42–12 win against the North Sydney Bears. The next game, Elliott scored the first and only field goal of his career in a win against South Sydney. In Round 18, he scored a try in a game against the Penrith Panthers. The Penrith club were up 22–6 at half-time and Canberra scored 16 points in the second half, but could not win, losing the game 22–28. Elliott made 22 appearances for the season, scoring 3 tries and a field goal.\nLater years (1986 and 1987).\nIn 1986, Elliott played 12 games in an unsuccessful Raiders season when the team finished 11th. Elliott did not score any tries for the season.\nHe played his final season in 1987. He only made two appearances for the season (round 7 and 25), playing his final game coming off the bench against South Sydney. It was a one-sided match with the Canberra side winning 26–2. Elliott retired at the age of 26. The Raiders lost the grand final against the Sea Eagles 18–8. Elliott concluded his career with 5 tries and a field goal (21 points) from 78 appearances."

        "title": "Variations of baseball",
        "text": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport that has many recreational variants (sometimes referred to as diamond sports). The major sport most related to baseball is the Olympic discipline of softball, with the two sports being administered internationally alongside Baseball5 (invented in 2017) by the World Baseball Softball Confederation.\nMany variations of baseball change the game significantly. For example, many variations are played informally, with less equipment/space requirements and a softer ball, and certain variations do not feature a pitcher, and/or have the batters hit the ball using their hands or feet, with failure to legally hit the ball on the first opportunity resulting in an automatic out. There may be a lack of baserunning, with base hits awarded according to the distance or number of bounces the batted ball takes before being fielded, and imaginary \"ghost runners\" advancing around the bases in lieu of actual runners.\nThere are also some bat-and-ball sports which are distinct from baseball, such as rounders, that strongly resemble it.\nHistory.\nEarly versions of baseball had regional variations in different parts of the United States, until the modern standard became the main form of baseball after the Civil War. Some features of those early variants can still be found in modern baseball variants, such as the use of underarm pitching in softball.\nBaseball, as the historical national pastime of America, inspired many variants. Many variations of baseball were invented in urban areas, where space was limited, and were often played with a spaldeen ball; features of the city streets, such as the manhole covers for the sewers, were often involved in regulations of the games.\nHistoric variations.\nMassachusetts Game.\nThe Massachusetts Game (also known as \"round ball\" because it was played on a circular field) was a competitor to what would eventually become the basis for modern baseball, the \"New York Game\". Some major differences of this game from baseball are:\nOlympic sports.\nSoftball.\nSoftball originated as a variation of baseball, and today is a very popular sport in its own right, with most of the rules remaining the same as baseball. The field is significantly smaller, with the bases only apart, and the pitcher is required to throw the ball underarm throughout the seven regulation innings of play. Softball is administered at the international level along with baseball by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, with the two sports being treated as disciplines of the same overall sport when played at the Olympics. Alongside the Olympic discipline of fastpitch softball, which is the most popular variation of softball, there is also modified fastpitch softball and slow-pitch softball.\nBaseball5.\nBaseball5 (B5) is an international variation of baseball where the only equipment used is a rubber ball, and the field is a -square. Batters \"self-serve\" the ball, hitting it with a bare hand to start each play, with foul balls and out-of-the-park home runs not permitted. Each team has only five players and there are five innings in the game. It is scheduled to be played at the 2026 Youth Olympic Games, and is administered by the World Baseball Softball Confederation.\nInformal variations.\nThese variations of baseball generally reduce the amount of equipment and space needed to play the game, and the ball is often softer to reduce the risk of injury. They may also be modified to work with fewer players; for example, some informal variations of baseball use the ghost runner rule, simulating having runners on base when a player must take their turn to bat. However, the basic structure of a pitcher throwing to a batter, with the batter hitting the ball with some type of bat, is retained.\nStickball.\nIn stickball, the bat is a broom handle, and the ball is generally a rubber ball or tennis ball. It is generally played as a street game.\nVitilla.\nVitilla is a variation of stickball played mostly in the Dominican Republic. Instead of a ball, a large plastic water bottle cap is thrown towards the batter, and there are only two bases to advance around before going to home plate. In addition, the strike zone is represented by a physical object behind the batter.\nLittle League Baseball.\nLittle League Baseball modifies some of the rules of baseball and softball to be more appropriate for children. It is played at an official level. \nWiffle ball.\nWiffle ball is played with a plastic bat and ball. The ball is designed to have more movement in the air, so that pitchers can more easily trick batters with different types of pitches.\nCorkball.\nCorkball does not feature baserunning: the value of a hit is measured by the distance traveled by the batted ball. The advancement of ghost runners placed on base is how runs are scored.\nGames with no pitcher.\nThe following variations of baseball do not have a pitcher, meaning that the batter starts every play with possession of the ball. They may feature strikes, or the batter may automatically be out for failing to legally hit the ball into fair territory.\nTee-ball.\nTee-ball is a popular introductory variant of baseball for children, with the ball placed on a \"batting tee\" each time a batter is prepared to hit. The batter hits the ball off the tee to commence play. Older players may be given the opportunity to face some pitches from their coach, making it easier for them to hit the ball while still helping them to progress toward facing an opposing pitcher. Each inning may be played until three outs, or until all players on the offensive team have had a turn to bat.\nGames with no bat.\nThe following games involve the use of either the hands or the legs in order to hit the ball.\nKickball.\nKickball is a popular variation of baseball, which involves batters kicking the ball with their legs. The ball is thrown underhand by the pitcher, and must roll to the batter.\nMatball.\nMatball, also known as Big Base, is a variation of kickball where multiple runners can be on a base, with the bases being large mats.\nVariations of Baseball5.\nBaseball5 is a variation of baseball which does not have several elements of conventional baseball, such as pitchers and bats.\nPunchball.\nPunchball/slapball is played with the hands: batters start each play off by hitting the ball into play using their bare hands. There is no pitcher.\nCuatro esquinas.\nCuatro esquinas (four corners) is a Cuban street game which inspired the creation of Baseball5.\nPelotica de goma.\nPelotica de goma is a Venezuelan street game which has been played for over 70 years.\nUnorthodox variations.\nBox baseball.\nThree boxes are drawn on the ground between the \"pitcher\" and \"batter\". The pitcher has to toss the ball underhand so that it bounces in the box closest to the batter, who then has to try to hit it (with their hand) back into the box nearest to the pitcher without letting the pitcher catch the ball. The box in the middle is considered foul territory, and neither player is allowed to step into the boxes after hitting/pitching. Bases are awarded according to how many bounces the ball takes after being hit by the batter and before being caught by the pitcher, with the game played to 9 innings.\nOver-the-line.\nOver-the-line (OTL) is a variation requiring only three players per team, and is played without gloves in some gender/age divisions. The batter stands at the point of a triangle, with his goal being to hit the ball (pitched by a teammate) over the opposing line of the triangle without the ball being caught by a defender. The fair territory is designated by two parallel lines emanating at right angles from the two corners of the triangle away from the batter. There is no baserunning, with runs scored when there are either 3+ \"base hits\" (uncaught fair balls) in an inning, or a \"home run\" (a ball landing past the furthest fielder).\nStoop ball.\nStoop ball is a variation where the ball is thrown by the batter at the steps of a stoop (concrete stairway) with the goal of making the rebounded ball travel away from the fielders. Bases or points are awarded based generally on the distance or number of bounces the ball takes before it is fielded.\nBeep baseball.\nBeep baseball is generally played by visually impaired or blind players, using a ball that beeps so that it can be located more easily. There are \"spotters\" who assist the fielders by indicating which section of the field the batted ball has been hit into. The game is played to six innings.\nDartball.\nDartball is played using a dartboard, with the results of each throw of the dart relating to the rules of baseball. \"Batters\" simulate an at-bat, with the dart's landing position on the board determining whether they get a ball or strike, and whether they ultimately reach base/advance runners already on base.\nRelated bat-and-ball sports.\nPesäpallo.\nPesäpallo, also known as Finnish baseball, was invented in the 1920s, with some of it being based on baseball. It has four bases placed at increasing distances between each other (such that the distance between 3rd base and home is greater than between home and 1st base.) The ball is pitched \"vertically\" to the batter (such that it is thrown upwards by the opposing pitcher at home base), and is hit as it lands. The game features a number of significant differences to baseball: it is not possible to hit out-of-the-park home runs, as these are considered foul balls, and batters do not have to run on fair contact, being allowed three chances to hit the ball (regardless of the result of each hit) before being forced.\nRounders.\nRounders involves a similar hitting of a thrown ball as baseball, with a \"rounder\" being scored upon rounding all four bases. There is no foul territory, so that the ball can be hit in any direction. It is popular in the United Kingdom among school children, having been played since the 1700s."

        "title": "2021–22 Western Michigan Broncos men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2021–22 Western Michigan Broncos men's ice hockey season was the 48th season of play for the program and the 9th season in the NCHC conference. They were coached by Pat Ferschweiler, in his first season, and played their home games at Lawson Arena.\nSeason.\nWestern Michigan commenced the Pat Ferschweiler era in fine form, securing victories in six of its first seven games. The team earned a signature win early on when it defeated top-ranked Michigan after jumping up into the national rankings.The Broncos encountered some difficulties in mid-November but rebounded by securing seven consecutive victories, propelling them into the top-5. WMU recorded more wins in the first half of the season than they had all of the previous year. While this is a bit misleading as the team's schedule was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the offense was rolling along to the tune of almost four goals a game when they paused for the winter break. The Bronco attack was led by Drew Worrad, Ethen Frank and Ronnie Attard. The trio put the team in a position to win most nights with Brandon Bussi providing capable goaltending when needed.\nExpectations were high for the team as it was getting ready for the Great Lakes Invitational. Unfortunately, COVID got in the way once more and forced what was supposed to be the rubber match with Michigan to be cancelled. The team then suffered a bigger blow when team captain Paul Washe left the club, though administrators were tight-lipped about the reasons at the time. Coronavirus put the team on the shelf until the third week of January. When they returned, however, the Broncos didn't appear to have lost any of their fight and put together another impressive stretch with 5 wins in 6 games.\nThe good times came to an abrupt halt in mid-February when the Broncos went 1–4–1 as they headed down the stretch. The offense dried up for a three-week span and dropped WMU out of contention for the conference regular season title. While they recovered in the final week of the season, albeit against the NCHC's worst team, Western Michigan ended up 3rd in the conference. More importantly, however, because the team had such a high ranking from their success before the losing skid, the Broncos were guaranteed to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament.\nPostseason.\nThe Broncos began their run against Omaha and, once more, their offense carried them to victory. A hat-trick by Luke Grainger was the difference in the first game while Worrad chipped in the final two WMU goals in the rematch. The defense firmed up in the semifinal and enabled the team to down tournament-bound North Dakota 4–2. In Western Michigan's first appearance in the NCHC title game, they met one of the stingiest defenses in Minnesota Duluth. The Broncos were only able to get 19 shots on goal in the contest and none of them could find their way into the cage.\nThough the team was disappointed by the result, their championship game appearance earned the Broncos a top-3 national ranking. That gave them one of the #1 seeds and they were sent to Worcester to take on Northeastern. While this was Western Michigan's seventh appearance in the national tournament, the team had still yet to win a single game. Not wanting history to repeat, WMU immediately went on the attack after the puck was dropped and tried to steamroll the Huskies. Northeastern replied in kind and the two teams skated up and down the ice, looking to break through. Western got on the board first, scoring in the later half of the opening period, but stellar goaltending from Devon Levi prevented the Broncos from increasing their advantage. Instead, the team held onto a slim lead for most of the contest while the Huskies attacked relentlessly. Bussi was up to the task, turning aside every Northeastern shot and putting the team in position to win. With just a few minutes remaining in regulation, Northeastern stole the puck at the Broncos' blueline and Aidan McDonough, one of the top goal scorers in the nation, broke towards the WMU net. He slipped around a fallen Jacob Bauer and then shuffled the puck around a sprawled-out Bussi to tie the score. When overtime began, both teams continued their attack and, at about the 90-second mark, Levi made a mistake behind his own net but appeared to make up for the gaffe with a spectacular save. However, upon video review, the puck was confirmed to have completely crossed the line and Luke Grainger became the hero of the Broncos first ever tournament victory.\nTheir second game of the tournament came against Minnesota and that contest was much different than the first. The Gophers hemmed the Broncos in their own zone for long stretches of the game and didn't allow WMU to get its powerful offense going. Minnesota opened the scoring in the first and seemed comfortable holding the small lead. Attard appeared to tie the score in the middle of the second, however, the goal was waved off due to offsides and left Western's offense stuck in neutral. The Broncos' only penalty of the game almost immediately resulted in a Gopher power play goal and appeared to seal the team's fate. An empty-net goal washed away all doubt and sent the Broncos home.\nWhile the end to their season was disappointing, this was still the furthest the Broncos had ever gotten in the postseason and ending a 7-game losing streak in NCAA play is an achievement in and of itself.\nRape allegations.\nJust prior to the postseason, Paul Washe was formally charged with sexual assault. Reportedly, the incident occurred at a party on December 5. The unnamed victim, also a WMU student, testified that Washe had led her into a basement and into a secluded corner. Despite repeated attempts to rebuke his advances, she said Washe forced her down and made her perform oral sex. He then pulled her up and raped her. The victim reported the alleged crime three days later and an investigation was launched. By early January, enough evidence had been uncovered to cause the school to suspend Washe, who had previously been investigated for Title IX accusations 4 years earlier.\nAfter news of indictment was made public, Washe was formally dismissed from the team. In May 2022, a judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to send the case to trial.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Unfortunately, due in part to missing all of the past season, the Bulldogs were very slow out of the gate and were never really able to find their stride.\nYale lost each of their first six games, however, more concerning was that the team went scoreless in four of those contests. Their offence did pick up a bit in early December but it didn't stay that way for long. Over the course of the season Yale's scoring was dreadful, averaging less than two goals a game. While the defense didn't play particularly well, it was able to keep the Bulldogs in most games. The pop-gun offense, however, could rarely take advantage.\nThe team played in two in-season tournaments during the year, finishing last in both. The Bulldogs also ended up dead-last in the ECAC Hockey standings and finished the year season with the second-worst PairWise ranking.

The Chiefs transferred to the NCAA in 2010, and have qualified to two Finals appearances, in 2014 and 2016, losing each time to the defending champions San Beda Red Lions.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nThe Arellano Flaming Arrows won the Basketball Association of the Philippines-organized National Student's Championship in the 1970s. The Flaming Arrows, coached by Cholo Martin and led by Joey Loyzaga, defeated the De La Salle Green Archers in the 1983 National Intercollegiate Championship. In 2006, the Flaming Arrows were named into the Chiefs, in honor of Cayetano Arellano, the first Chief Justice of the Philippines and university's namesake.\nNCRAA stint.\nIn 2006, the Chiefs lost out to the St. Francis Doves in the NCRAA Finals. On the next year, they defeated the EAC Generals to win their first NCRAA title off the heroics of Gio Ciriacruz. The Chiefs then defeated the Doves in the next season's Finals.\nIn the 2009 campaign they were defeated by the Universal College Golden Dragons in the finals. Arellano sought to enter the NCAA in time for the 2009–10 season, but the association deferred in accepting new members. The NCAA instead invited three schools, including Arellano as guest teams.\nEntry to the NCAA.\nThe Chiefs ended up with the best record among the three guest teams. In 2014, led by Jio Jalalon and coach Jerry Codiñera, the Chiefs qualified to its first Finals appearance. They were swept by the four-time defending champions San Beda Red Lions. On the next year, the Chiefs missed the Final Four, but returned to the Finals in 2016. In a rematch of the 2014 Finals, the Chiefs were again swept by San Beda. Two years later, the Chiefs struggled on the floor and had a losing season. Codiñera resigned and replaced by Junjie Ablan.\nOn the next campaign the university rehired Cholo Martin as its new coach. Martin's best season came in the 2021 bubble season played in early 2022, where they were eliminated in the play-in tournament by the Perpetual Altas. The Chiefs missed the playoffs in 2022; Martin was fired and was replaced by Chico Manabat.\nCurrent roster.\nNCAA Season 98"

Two years later, they won the championship vs. the San Sebastian Stags, while under probation. The Blazers won just days after their brother team De La Salle Green Archers won the UAAP championship. The Blazers, under the leadership of players such as Mark Magsumbol and Sunday Salvacion developed a rivalry with the Stags, whom they met again the Finals two years later; this time, the Stags won.

From 2005 until 2007, they were coached by former Benilde player Caloy Garcia; he led them to three consecutive losing seasons. Gee Abanilla and Richard del Rosario next coached the team for the next four years, with the team missing the playoffs on all instances, with Del Rosario resigning in 2012. With new coach Gabby Velasco, the Blazers avoided last place in 2013, then narrowly missed the playoffs in 2014. The next year, the Blazers endured a 17-game losing streak, only to win on their last game, finishing last. Velasco resigned and was replaced by TY Tang. Tang led the Blazers to fifth place finishes in his second and third year of coaching the team, but migrated to Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2022, the Blazers appointed Charles Tiu to coach the team. In his first year in NCAA Season 97 would be closest they've gotten to make it to the playoffs where they finished fourth after the elimination round, but due to COVID-19 restrictions, each team met the other teams only once, and a play-in tournament was done in lieu of the second round.

Freddie Hubalde won the NCAA MVP award in 1973, and will be team mate of Co in the grand-slam winning 1983 Crispa Redmanizers team. Alvin Patrimonio then played for the Cardinals from 1983 to 1986, becoming NCAA MVP in his final two seasons with MIT.\nIn 1991, the Cardinals coached by Joel Banal won its last title off a go-ahead shot by Benny Cheng against the San Beda Red Lions.\nFinal Four era.\nIn 2001, Mapua qualified to its first playoff appearance in the Final Four era. They took the eventual champions San Sebastian Stags to a second game before being eliminated. Two years later, they were eliminated in the semifinals against Letran. Starting in 2005, Kelvin dela Peña led the Cardinals to four straight semifinals appearances, losing to defending champions PCU in 2005 and to San Beda in the next three years. Dela Peña was named Rookie of the Year in 2005, and Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2007.\nThe Cardinals would not make it to the playoffs until 2015 when Nigerian Allwell Oraeme led them to the semifinals. Named Rookie of the Year, MVP, and three other awards, he and coach Atoy Co ended two seasons of being in last place to qualify to the semifinals, where they were beaten by Letran. Oraeme had another banner year in 2016, winning the MVP award and Defensive Player of the Year. The Cardinals lost to the Arellano Chiefs in the semifinals. Preparing for the 2017 season, Co revealed that Oraeme left school, saying he was not happy at Mapua and intends to go back to Nigeria. The Cardinals finished outside the playoff places in the next two seasons, and Mapua let go Co after the 2018 campaign.\nRandy Alcantara, coach of the successful Malayan Red Robins (their high school team), was then named coach of the seniors team. In the 2021 season (held in early 2022), the Cardinals qualified to its first Finals appearance since 1995. They lost to the defending champions Letran Knights. In the next season, Mapua won its first game vs. San Beda, which was then reversed due to an ineligible player. The Cardinals then lost seven consecutive games. Mapua did not qualify to the playoffs. On the next season, Mapua clinched its first #1 seed in school history, returning to the playoffs. However, the Cardinals were upset by the San Beda Red Lions in the finals.\nCurrent roster.\nNCAA Season 99\nRivalries.\nMapua plays the Battle of Intramuros, so named after the Manila district, with the Letran Knights."

        "text": "William O'Neill is an American college men's ice hockey coach. O'Neill has been the head coach at Salem State University since 1981, winning more than 600 games in that time.\nCareer.\nO'Neill's college career began in 1975 with the Boston University Terriers. After playing in just one game as a freshman, he grew into his role as a depth defensemen and helped BU win the National Championship in 1978. After graduating, O'Neill attended a tryout for the Boston Bruins but, when nothing materialized, he signed on as a graduate assistant at Norwich University.\nAfter two years with the Cadets, O'Neill was named as the head coach at Salem State. He saw a good deal of success in the early part of his tenure, leading the Vikings to five 20-win seasons in the span of ten years and made four consecutive appearances in the NCAA Tournament. After the mid-90's, the program declined slightly; though they routinely posted winning records, the team didn't make any NCAA appearance for almost 20 years. Even when Salem State won the inaugural MASCAC tournament championship, the league hadn't yet been given an automatic bid so O'Neill's championship team wasn't invited to participate.\nDespite the lack of sustained success in recent years, O'Neill continues to lead the Vikings. Near the end of the 2019 season, O'Neill recorded his 600th victory, becoming just the fourth coach in NCAA history to achieve that feat with one team. When the program cancelled its 2020–21 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, O'Neill was 12th all-time in wins with 606. At that time he was the longest-tenured coach at any NCAA program and had more wins than any active bench boss at the Division III level. As of 2021, only Jerry York, at Boston College, possesses more wins among active coaches."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Ambrose Burnside",
        "text": "Major General Ambrose E. Burnside, also known as the Ambrose Burnside Monument, is a monumental equestrian statue in Providence, Rhode Island, United States. The statue, located in the city's Burnside Park, was designed by sculptor Launt Thompson and depicts Ambrose Burnside, an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War who later served as the governor of Rhode Island. Ambrose had died in 1881 and the project to erect a statue in his honor began shortly afterwards. It was dedicated on July 4, 1887 in a large ceremony that included several notable guests of honor, such as General William Tecumseh Sherman, Colonel Robert Hale Ives Goddard, and the governors of both Connecticut and Rhode Island. The monument was originally located in Exchange Place (now known as Kennedy Plaza), but it was moved to its current location in the early 1900s. As part of the move, the pedestal was replaced with one designed by William R. Walker.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nAmbrose Burnside was a military officer who served in the United States Army during the mid-1800s. After graduating from the United States Military Academy in 1847, he participated in the Mexican–American War. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, he led the 1st Rhode Island Infantry Regiment of the Union Army and was later promoted to commanding the Army of the Potomac. In the later parts of the war, Burnside was moved to commanding positions in other departments, including the Department of the Ohio and the IX Corps. Following the war, he was elected to several terms as governor of Rhode Island, and afterwards was elected to the U.S. Senate. He died on September 13, 1881. Following this, he lay in state in Providence City Hall.\nCreation.\nThe day after Burnside's death, Colonel Isaac M. Potter suggested erecting a statue in his honor, and less than a week after his funeral, a group of soldiers gathered at the Grand Army of the Republic's Prescott Post Hall in Providence at Potter's request. The result of this meeting was the formation of a General Committee to oversee the monument project, with General Horatio Rogers Jr. as its chairman. This committee then began fundraising, and by January 1883, enough money had been raised that a meeting was held on January 20 where a Building Committee was appointed to select an artist and location in Providence for the monument, which would be an equestrian statue. In May 1883, the Building Committee commissioned sculptor Launt Thompson of New York City to design the monument, which was to be created by May 20, 1886. Thompson would be paid $30,000 for the work, with half to be received at the submission of a plaster model to a bronze foundry and the other half to be received when the statue was placed on a pedestal, which was to be designed by Thompson and provided by the committee. At the time, Thompson was working on another commission, a statue of Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont in Washington, D.C.\nIn designing the statue, Thompson bought several horses to use as models and make several changes until a final design was determined. The Burnside monument was Thompson's last major work, as well as the only equestrian statue in his career. According to a preservationist with the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission, the statue was commissioned during a time they referred to as the \"Bronze Age\"—the period from the 1870s to the 1920s when many bronze Civil War statues were erected across the country. Work on the Burnside project took longer than expected, and it was not until July 1885 that a sketch of the statue was submitted by Thompson and approved by the committee, and it took until August 1886 that a plaster model was submitted for casting at the Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company in New York City. \nMeanwhile, Thompson's pedestal design was accepted by the committee, with some slight modifications from the committee's consulting architect William R. Walker, and created by architect Henry O. Avery of New York City, with the location for the monument selected to be Exchange Place (later renamed Kennedy Plaza). Specifically, the statue would be on the eastern end of the plaza. Additional contracting work was done by George Gerhard of East Providence, Rhode Island and Franklin L. Mason of Providence, while the city government added a curbed sidewalk to hinder the possibility of auto accidents with the monument. The marble for the pedestal was acquired from Frederick L. Mathewson's quarry in Burrillville, Rhode Island and was cut and prepared by Providence citizen Isaac M. Sweet. The total cost of the monument (not including the sidewalk installation) was about $40,000, with the government of Rhode Island contributing $10,854.69 of this amount, the city contributing an additional $5,000, and the remainder raised through private donations. By April 1887, it was determined that the monument would be ready for unveiling on July 4 (Independence Day). In preparation for this, the Rhode Island General Assembly appropriated $4,000 towards the dedication ceremony, in addition to $1,000 for transporting veterans to the event and $2,500 for the governor to call upon the militia for the event. This was all in addition to $2,000 set aside by the city council for Independence Day festivities. All veterans living in Rhode Island were invited to attend, with free transportation and food provided. The statue itself was cast and shipped to Providence in June 1887.\nDedication.\nThe statue was dedicated on July 4, 1887, in a ceremony that began with a procession at 10:30 a.m. The procession included mounted police, the marshals for the event (of which Potter was the chief marshal), the Rhode Island Militia, and many veterans, including members of the Grand Army of the Republic. In total, about 5,000 people marched in the procession, which lasted over an hour. At the end of the procession was a carriage holding Rhode Island Governor John W. Davis and other guests of honor, including General William Tecumseh Sherman and the governor of Connecticut, Phineas C. Lounsbury. \"Marching Through Georgia\", a Civil War march, was played during the parade to cheers from spectators.\nThe parade marched through Providence and ended at the monument, where the American Band played an overture before Governor Davis was introduced to the crowd by Henry Rodman Barker. Davis then gave a brief speech before an invocation was given by the Reverend Joseph J. Woolley. General Lewis Richmond then gave a short speech before unveiling the statue, which was accompanied by the American Band playing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the crowd cheered. General Rogers was then introduced as the ceremony's orator and proceeded to give a lengthy oration in praise of Burnside, recounting some of his experiences in the Civil War and testifying to his character. At the end, Governor Davis introduced Thompson to the crowd and thanked him for his work on the statue, with Thompson giving a one-sentence reply to the crowd that he was proud to have been selected to create the monument and that he hoped it would be satisfactory to the people of Providence and Rhode Island. After this, Colonel Robert Hale Ives Goddard spoke on behalf of the Monument Committee and offered the monument to the city of Providence, with Providence Mayor Gilbert F. Robbins accepting. The ceremony ended with the Reverend Christopher Hughes giving a benediction and the band playing the \"American Hymn\". Following the close, a large reception was held for the guests of honor and veterans. Additionally, other Independence Day-related festivities occurred throughout Providence for the rest of the day.\nLater history.\nIn December 1902, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed an act to relocate some monuments in Providence, including the Burnside statue. As part of the act, the General Assembly would pay for both the statue's relocation and the creation of a new pedestal. In 1906, the statue was moved from Exchange Plaza to the northeast corner of nearby City Hall Park, which would later be known as Burnside Park. The statue was placed on a new pedestal designed by Walker. In 1993, the statue was surveyed as part of the Save Outdoor Sculpture! project. In July 2015, the city of Providence spent $13,500 in hiring Buccacio Sculpture Studios LLC of Natick, Massachusetts to restore the statue as part of a larger renovation of the Kennedy Plaza area.\nDesign.\nThe monument consists of a bronze equestrian statue of Burnside atop a granite pedestal. The statue depicts Burnside overlooking a battlefield, with binoculars in his right hand and the horse's reins in his left. The horse is depicted with all four feet planted on the ground and also staring directly ahead. Burnside is dressed in his Civil War military attire. The statue itself is approximately tall, with the horse measuring approximately from the ground to its withers. The total statue is approximately 1.5 times life-size, with Burnside depicted as an approximately tall man. The pedestal is divided into two parts, with the upper portion measuring tall and the lower portion measuring . The upper pedestal covers a rectangular area of by , while the lower part has side measurements of and . By comparison, the original pedestal measured roughly or tall, making the total original height of the monument about . Today, the total height is roughly . The base of the statue bears markings from both the sculptor (Launt Thompson 1887 Sculptor) and the foundry (The Henry-Bonnard Bronze Co. 1887.), while the front of the pedestal bears the inscription \"BURNSIDE\".\nAnalysis.\nIn an 1887 encyclopedia of art, Samuel Greene Wheeler Benjamin stated that the statue was \"a work of considerable merit\" and compares it favorably to other equestrian statues in the United States, such as Thomas Ball's statue of George Washington in Boston, John Quincy Adams Ward's statue of George Henry Thomas in Washington D.C., and Henry Kirke Brown's statues of Winfield Scott and George Washington in Washington, D.C., and New York City, respectively. However, in the same review, Benjamin stated that while all of those statues were \"meritorious works\", \"none are of the first rank\". Meanwhile, an 1891 article in \"The American Architect &amp; Building News\" gave the following review: \"Considering the character of the sculptor's previous work, this, his only piece of equestrian sculpture, is surprisingly good. It is sober, dignified, well-composed and, though the modelling is commonplace and hardly bears examination, the whole monument is deserving of a much better site than has been accorded it, for it is pushed aside to one end of an irregular-shaped square near the railroad station, where it is hemmed about by cars, carriages and wagons; but the squalor and bustle of its surroundings do but enhance and make conspicuous the virtues of a quiescent pose in a public statue.\" A 1965 catalogue from the Metropolitan Museum of Art states that many of Thompson's Civil War-related statuary, including the Burnside statue, were designed \"in the heavy-handed, cast-iron, realistic style that prevailed between 1865 and 1895.\""

        "text": "Jonathon Alexander Evans (born May 1, 1997) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player for the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL. \nEarly life.\nEvans was born on May 1, 1997, in Delta, British Columbia, Canada to parents John and Marni Evans. Growing up in North Delta, he participated in the North Delta Minor Hockey Association before moving to the Delta Hockey Academy.\nPlaying career.\nAfter playing for the Delta Hockey Academy U18 Prep for the 2013–14 season, Evans joined the Powell River Kings in the British Columbia Hockey League and Delta Ice Hawks of the Pacific Junior Hockey League. While playing with the River Kings during the 2016–17 season, Evans recorded 36 goals and 42 assists for 78 points to be named a BCHL Second Team All-Star. As a result of his productive career with the Powell River Kings, Evans earned a hockey scholarship to play with the UConn Huskies men's ice hockey team. UConn hockey coach Mike Cavanaugh has originally been scouting his teammate, Carter Turnbull, but was impressed by Evans' play during the post-season.\nCollegiate.\nEvans joined the UConn Huskies as a freshman during their 2018–19 season. As a rookie, he tallied 16 points in 22 games to rank ninth among all Hockey East rookies. He scored his first collegiate goal in a 4–2 loss to the Quinnipiac Bobcats men's ice hockey team on October 16. During the season, he played alongside Ruslan Iskhakov before suffering an injury that left him sidelined for one month. Upon returning to the lineup in February, he recorded five goals and five assists. He returned to the Huskies for his sophomore campaign where he increased his scoring output and recorded his first and second collegiate hat-trick. While the season was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Evans continued to work on his strength and conditioning by spending time in the weight room.\nFollowing his first two seasons, Evans had a breakout junior campaign during the shortened 2020–21 season. He appeared in all 23 games and led the Hockey East conference in scoring, with 29 points and a team-best 14 goals and 15 assists. As a result, Evans set numerous program records; he became UConn's first player since 1998 to be named to the CCM/ACHA All-American Team and was also the first Husky in program history to be named a finalist for the Hockey East Player of the Year Award. Likewise, Evans was also named the Hockey East Scoring Champion and shared the PNC Three Stars Award. \nProfessional.\nFollowing his senior year at UConn, Evans and teammate Carter Turnbull signed amateur tryout contracts with the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL. Evans made an immediate impact upon joining the team by tallying one goal and two assists in his professional debut against the Trois-Rivières Lions. Evans finished his 11-game stint with the team with seven goals and six assists. On July 15, 2022, the Stingrays signed him to a one-year contract. Prior to the start of the 2022–23 season, Evans was invited to participate in the Hershey Bears American Hockey League (AHL) training camp. The Bears are the AHL affiliate of the Stingrays and Washington Capitals. Evans spent a week at the AHL training camp before returning to the Stingrays. During the 2022–23 season, Evans and Turnbull remained linemates and began the season by leading the team in scoring. Evans finished the season with nine goals and 21 assists for 30 points through 41 games. He also signed a contract extension to remain with the team through the 2023–24 season."
