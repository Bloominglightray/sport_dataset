        "title": "1973 NCAA University Division basketball championship game",
        "text": "The 1973 NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game was the final of the 1973 NCAA University Division basketball tournament and determined the national champion for the 1972–73 season. The game was held at the St. Louis Arena in St. Louis, Missouri, on March 26, 1973.\nThe UCLA Bruins of the Pacific-8 Conference, who were seeking their seventh consecutive championship, were matched against the Memphis State Tigers (now known as the Memphis Tigers), who were playing in the national title game for the first time. The Bruins won 87–66 behind a 44-point effort by Bill Walton, who scored on 21 of his 22 field goal attempts.\nBackground.\nUCLA Bruins.\nThe Bruins were coached by John Wooden, who was in his 25th season with the team. UCLA entered the 1972–73 season as the six-time defending national champions, and the Bruins were coming off of an undefeated 30–0 season in 1971–72. Five players on UCLA's roster later played in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Center Bill Walton was the Bruins' top scorer and rebounder, averaging 20.4 points and 16.9 rebounds. Forward Jamaal Wilkes added 14.8 points and 7.3 rebounds per game, while forward Larry Farmer and guard Larry Hollyfield also averaged more than 10 points per game. Other players included centers Ralph Drollinger and Swen Nater, forwards Dave Meyers and Vince Carson, and guards Tommy Curtis, Greg Lee, and Pete Trgovich.\nThe preseason Associated Press (AP) Poll ranked the Bruins as the number one team in the country. UCLA's first game was on November 25, 1972, against Wisconsin; the Bruins won by a 41-point margin. In each of their first six non-conference games, all of which were held at Pauley Pavilion, they won by double digits; during this stretch, Pittsburgh was the only team to lose against UCLA by less than 20 points. An 85–72 victory over Drake improved the Bruins to 7–0, before Illinois became the first team to keep the final score within 10 points, as UCLA claimed a 71–64 win in their game on December 30.\nThe Bruins' first game in 1973 was their Pacific-8 Conference opener at home against Oregon, which they won 64–38 to move to 9–0 on the season. Three conference victories followed, before UCLA prevailed in four consecutive non-conference matchups to run their record to 16–0. The first two non-conference wins were over teams ranked in the top 10 at the time of the games; 10th-ranked San Francisco fell 92–64 on January 19, while number nine Providence was defeated by 24 points. On January 27, UCLA posted an 82–63 victory over Notre Dame. It was the school's 61st straight win in men's basketball, breaking an NCAA record that had been held by San Francisco. The Bruins returned to conference play with a 79–56 win at 20th-ranked USC, and the team continued its winning streak into March; a triumph over California improved its record to 24–0. On March 3, Stanford played the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion and held them to a season-low 51 points. In their closest game of the season, UCLA managed a 51–45 win. The Bruins then won their regular season finale against USC to finish at a perfect 26–0; with a 14–0 mark in Pacific-8 games; they won the conference championship. UCLA maintained its number one ranking in the AP Poll for the entire season.\nUCLA received an invitation to the 1973 NCAA Tournament and was placed in the West region. In their first game of the tournament, the Bruins faced Arizona State, winning 98–81 to advance to the regional final against San Francisco. There, they won by a 15-point margin to earn a berth in the Final Four. Indiana was UCLA's opponent in that round, and the Bruins jumped out to a 40–22 lead at halftime. Although the Hoosiers went on a 17–0 scoring run in the second half and pulled within two points of the Bruins multiple times, UCLA won 70–59 to reach the title game. The team shot 58.5% from the field, as Walton had 14 points and Wilkes added 13.\nMemphis State Tigers.\nGene Bartow was the coach of Memphis State, having been hired by the university for the 1970–71 season. The Tigers' leading scorer was guard Larry Finch, who averaged 24.0 points per game on 44.5% shooting. Future NBA player Larry Kenon, a forward, also averaged more than 20 points per game, on 52.5% shooting, and led Memphis State in rebounding with 16.7 per game. Center Ronnie Robinson had 13.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game. Other regulars included center Wes Westfall, forwards Ken Andrews and Billy Buford, and guards Bill Cook, Bill Laurie and Doug McKinnie.\nMemphis State began the season ranked 11th in the country, but the team lost three of its first five games. Following a season-opening win over Missouri Western, LSU defeated the Tigers 94–81 on December 5, 1972. A visit to fifth-ranked Marquette resulted in a three-point defeat, and an 80–79 loss to Texas left the Tigers with a 2–3 record. They evened their record at 3–3 on December 16, with an 80–51 victory over Navy. That was the start of an extended winning steak; after wins against Arkansas, Cornell, and UC Santa Barbara, the Tigers traveled to Vanderbilt for a meeting with a top-10 opponent. With a 74–71 road victory, Memphis State extended its streak to five games before the start of Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) play.\nDrake was Memphis State's first opponent in MVC competition. The Tigers were taken to double overtime by Drake, but earned a 97–92 victory. Subsequent wins against Bradley, Saint Louis, Louisville, and New Mexico State improved the Tigers to 5–0 in the conference. They were followed by the team's second contests of the season against Drake and Bradley, both of which they won; at this point the club's winning streak had reached 14 games. By late January, the Tigers had returned to being ranked in the AP Poll; in the February 6 ranking, Memphis State was listed at number 15. In the Tigers' next game, on February 8, Louisville ended their winning streak by an 83–69 margin. Afterwards, the Tigers won their next five games, all against MVC opponents, before losing to Saint Louis, 70–56, in their regular season finale. The Tigers finished in first place in the MVC with a 12–2 mark in conference play, and were 21–5 overall. Their final national ranking was 12th.\nLike UCLA, the Tigers received a bye in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. They defeated South Carolina in the Midwest regional semifinals by 14 points. Memphis State then posted a 20-point win over Kansas State to gain their Final Four spot. In the national semifinals, Providence opposed the Tigers and took a double-digit advantage before one of their leading players, Marvin Barnes, was forced to leave the game due to a knee injury. After trailing at halftime by nine points, the Tigers rallied to win, 98–85, and secure their place in the national championship game. Kenon led Memphis State with 28 points, while Robinson had 24 and Finch added 21. It was the school's first trip to an NCAA Tournament final, having never made it past the first round in three previous appearances.\nGame summary.\nThe game was held on March 26 at the St. Louis Arena in St. Louis, Missouri, before a crowd of 19,301 fans. It was preceded by a contest between Indiana and Providence for third place. Behind a pair of 21-point efforts by Steve Downing and John Ritter, Indiana prevailed by 18 points, 97–79. The championship game was televised by NBC, which purchased the broadcasting rights to the 1973 NCAA Tournament for less than $1.2 million. Curt Gowdy provided play-by-play commentary for NBC, and Tom Hawkins worked alongside him as an analyst. Having been held on Saturdays in previous years, the 1973 title game was moved to Monday. It was the first basketball national championship game to appear in prime time, and received a 20.5 Nielsen rating; an estimated 39 million people watched the broadcast, the most ever for an NCAA Tournament game at the time. The telecast garnered a 36.0 rating in the Los Angeles market.\nMemphis State began the game in a man-to-man defense, in which Kenon was the primary defender covering Walton, playing behind him. The team's plan was to force Walton to play away from the basket, but his ability to use his strength to gain positioning rendered the strategy largely ineffective. Walton played a key role early on for the Bruins; of the team's first 10 points, he had six of them. Kenon led the Tigers in the first six minutes of the game, converting each of his first four field goal attempts. However, the Tigers' taller players were in the process of accumulating personal fouls. Kenon committed three fouls in the first 6:43 and was forced to the bench for an extended period. At this point, he had been responsible for 8 of Memphis State's 12 points. The Bruins built a lead as the first half progressed, taking a nine-point advantage at one time. Finch then helped the Tigers get back into the game with a stretch of eight consecutive points. Memphis State began utilizing a zone defense, and Kenon returned to the game; he was still positioned behind Walton defensively. The Tigers were helped by an accumulation of fouls by Walton, who picked up his third and came out of the game with 4:14 remaining in the first half as the Bruins retained a six-point lead. After his departure, the Tigers' offensive players found greater success, scoring eight of the next 10 points. After the first half, the teams were tied, 39–39.\nFinch opened the second half scoring for Memphis State with two free throws, which gave the Tigers the lead. Walton responded for the Bruins with three field goals in a row. UCLA frequently sought to take advantage of a size advantage Walton held over shorter Memphis State defenders by having Lee throw lob passes to him. Much of Walton's offense came from these lobs, which often led to tip-ins. His scoring, which primarily came from near the basket, also resulted from layups and short jumpers, including bank and hook shots. The Tigers further varied their defense against him, at times putting a defender in front of Walton or covering him with two players, but were unable to keep him in check. Walton continued to be the focal point of the Bruins' attack, scoring all but 4 of their first 18 points in the half. Although the teams were tied 45–45 at one time, UCLA gradually gained control of the game as the second half progressed. The Bruins were up by four points with under 13 minutes left in the game when Walton drove to the basket for a shot attempt. Westfall fouled Walton, but was unable to prevent his shot from falling. His foul was ruled intentional, giving Walton two free throws that he made to extend UCLA's advantage to eight points with 12:24 remaining. Eight minutes into the second half, the lead had increased to 57–47. With 9:27 left, and the Bruins up 61–55, Walton committed his fourth foul. Instead of pulling him from the game, Wooden elected to leave him on the court and the Bruins subsequently extended their lead to 10.\nWith under eight minutes on the clock, and the Tigers' deficit at 65–57, Walton recorded three quick baskets to push the gap to 12 points. For the rest of the game, Memphis State never trailed by less than nine points. Having been up by 11 points 14 minutes into the second half, UCLA pulled away in the final minutes of the contest, scoring 14 of the last 18 points. Walton was forced to come out of the game with 2:50 remaining due to an ankle injury, but by this time the Bruins had a 15-point advantage. The Tigers' Finch helped him off the court, and Walton received a standing ovation from the crowd. The Bruins won by an 87–66 margin to clinch the school's seventh NCAA title in a row and its ninth in a 10-year span.\nStatistical summary.\nThe Bruins scored on 40 of their 62 field goal attempts, for a percentage of 64.5%. Walton contributed 44 points on 21-of-22 shooting from the field. His effort broke the record for the most points in an NCAA Tournament championship game, topping the 42 points that had been scored by Gail Goodrich in 1965. Four further shots by Walton that went into the hoop were ruled out by officials because of an NCAA regulation that banned dunking; these were not included in his official statistics, and were recorded as offensive goaltending violations. He added a game-high 13 rebounds and two assists, along with seven blocks. Wilkes tallied 16 points; he joined Walton as the only Bruins players to finish with at least 10 points. Hollyfield had eight points and nine assists, and Lee topped both teams with a 14-assist performance. The Bruins' victory extended multiple winning streaks for the team. It was their 75th consecutive win overall; in the NCAA Tournament, they had a 36-game streak after their defeat of the Tigers.\nMemphis State made 42.1% of its field goal attempts, shooting 24-of-57. Finch converted on nine of his 21 shots and 11 of his 13 free throw attempts, scoring 29 points to lead the Tigers. Kenon added 20 points, and had eight rebounds and three assists, both team-high totals. The Tigers committed nine fewer turnovers than the Bruins, but were outrebounded 40–21, and their 11 assists were 15 fewer than UCLA compiled.\nAftermath and legacy.\nWith Walton still on their roster as a senior for the 1973–74 season, the Bruins extended their winning streak to a record 88 games before a 71–70 loss to Notre Dame. Despite that defeat and a two-game losing streak later in the season, UCLA qualified for the NCAA tournament and made it to the Final Four. There, North Carolina State defeated the Bruins in a game that ended in double overtime, leaving UCLA without an NCAA title for the first time since 1965–66. The following season, which was Wooden's last as UCLA's coach, the Bruins again reached the NCAA tournament and won the championship game over Kentucky.\nMemphis State finished 19–11 in 1973–74 and did not receive an NCAA Tournament invitation. That was Bartow's last season with the Tigers. After one year at Illinois, he succeeded Wooden at UCLA and his 1975–76 team reached the Final Four. That season, Memphis State returned to the NCAA Tournament; it took another nine years for the Tigers to make another trip to the national semifinals. Having played against UCLA in the Final Four, the 2007–08 Tigers participated in the 2008 NCAA Division I championship game, losing to Kansas in overtime.\nWalton's 44 points remains the most ever scored in an NCAA men's national championship game. In 2016, Bryce Miller of \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" said that he had given \"arguably the single greatest performance in NCAA history.\" \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Kelli Anderson listed his 1973 title game effort as one of the 10 greatest accomplishments in college sports. The magazine named it one of the \"100 Greatest Moments in Sports History\".\nBartow remarked after the game, \"We couldn't contain Walton.\" He added that he had \"never seen a player so dominating\". Walton later said that he recalled his missed field goal attempt, which he rebounded and scored from. Wooden reportedly told him, \"Walton, I used to think you were a good player ... until you missed that one shot.\""

        "title": "1909 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1909 Auckland Rugby League season was the league's first ever official season. It celebrated its centenary in 2009. Four representative matches had been played in 1908 as players in Auckland attempted to showcase the new code to both Auckland residents and those elsewhere.\n \n \nFirst meeting.\nA meeting of players was held on Monday 12 July where it was decided to call for another meeting the following Monday and to invite all interested parties to attend. The ultimate aim was to form a league. It was also stated that \"three clubs will be formed, two in the city and one at the North Shore\". The meeting was duly held on 19 July at the Chamber of Commerce on Swanson Street. Mr. A.E. Glover, M.P., occupied the chair, and there was a large attendance of around 150 supporters and players. They were to affiliate with the Northern Union and hold a practice match on the following Saturday. \"Mr. R. Eagleton offered the league the use of three suitable playing grounds in Epsom\". The ground was located near Potters Paddock which was later converted into Alexandra Racecourse. Elections for officers were also held with 14 appointments made.\nNorth Shore Albions formed.\nA further meeting was held at North Shore on the Wednesday evening at the Council Chambers in Devonport with 40 in attendance, and a club was formed. It was noted that they had the playing numbers for two teams and they had \"taken the pick of the amateur players of the district club\". The club would be called North Shore Albions. On the Thursday night a preliminary meeting was held in the city with 20 players attending with the goal of forming a club that was either a city team or a combination of a city and Ponsonby team, while a Newton club was also aimed to be formed the following week as there was \"considerable dissatisfaction among the members at the management of the Auckland Union\". It was decided to play a match on the Saturday between the North Shore team and the city team. The match was duly played between North Shore and City and resulted in a win to the former by 44 points to 22.\nChairman of the league, D.W. McLean spoke with a representative of \"The New Zealand Herald\" and was reported as saying the following; \"no payment would be made for playing, but the men when away from home would be recompensed for lost time. They would provide players with uniforms free in order that a team might take the field in a regulation costume, not in varied coloured pants and stockings, as is often seen even in rep. Rugby matches. Their meetings would be open to the press and full information will be given to the public of all moneys received and expended...\". He \"spoke enthusiastically of the possibilities of the new code, from which he contended the rougher elements of rugby had been removed, this providing a game which was full of bright play and sparkling situations. The liability of getting hurt had been greatly reduced by the removal of scrums and line-out play\". It was also reported that several prominent players, questioned about why they had left the Rugby Union game said that \"they were tired of the unequalness of the contests under the present system. There was no sport in being beaten by 61 points to nil as the North Shore seniors were recently by the Ponsonby team… the management of the Auckland Union was not mindful enough of the clubs’ or players interests\".\nPonsonby United born.\nAt a meeting at Leys Institute on 30 July the Ponsonby club was formed. There were 50 supporters present with Mr. A Thompson chairing the meeting. Also in attendance were Mr James Carlaw, along with Arthur Carlaw, Charles Dunning, and Jack Stanaway. They called for another meeting to be held the following week to enroll players. They played a match against Newton Rangers on August 21 which they won by 16 points to 6.\nRepresentative matches.\nAuckland played four representative matches, though the first match was still prior to the official formation of the league. They played the New Zealand Maori team, two matches against Taranaki, one against Wellington, and a further match against Rotorua which was a largely junior side. The match versus Wellington on 9 October drew 4,000 spectators and raised £122 for the Auckland Rugby League.\nAuckland v NZ Maori.\nA match was played between Auckland and a New Zealand Māori team on 10 July which was preparing to depart for a tour of Australia. The Auckland team was victorious by 21 points to 14 in front of a crowd estimated at 3,000. Proceeds from the match were to go towards the formation and establishment of the league. Auckland City Council granted use of Victoria Park for the match to be played on Saturday, 10 July. The council allowed for an admission charge \"not exceeding one shilling for each person… with an extra shilling for every horse or vehicle, and an additional charge not exceeding one shilling for each person for admission to the pavilion\". The Maori team was preparing for a tour of Australia. They had been based in Te Kūiti with Barclay tutoring the side. He had been a member of the last 'native' team to tour Australia. The Auckland team was preparing hard under the guidance of William Mackrell.\nTrial Match (Probables v Possibles).\nA trial match was played to choose the Auckland team to play Taranaki. At the conclusion of the game sole selector William Wynyard chose the Auckland side. It was said that it was \"not a good exhibition\" though to be expected given the circumstances. There was no scoring reported by either the Auckland Star or the New Zealand Herald.\nAuckland v Taranaki.\nTaranaki tipped over the home team 8–7. On 31 July a trial match was played between A and B teams before William Wynyard selected the representative side to face Taranaki. It was an uninspiring encounter, won by the Possible selection 37–29. Prior to the representative match a curtain raiser was played between North Shore Juniors and a City side. The match against Taranaki marked the first 'official' Auckland team as it was selected after an actual league had formed despite Auckland teams playing in 1908 while the sport was being established. \nAuckland v Taranaki.\nOn 12 September a trial match was played at Eagleton's Paddock in Epsom between A and B teams. The A team won by 22 points to 8 with tries for the A team to Arthur Carlaw 2, Fred Jackson, William Mackrell, George Seagar, and Winters, with D Bradburn kicking 2 conversions. While for the B team Smith and Frederick Neighbour scored tries, and Neighbour also kicked a conversion.\nWilliam Wynyard then selected the team to face Taranaki in New Plymouth and they fared better this time winning by 27 points to 11.\nAuckland B v Rotorua.\nAn Auckland B travelled to Rotorua to play the local side and was trounced by a much better team filled with Māori players who had represented them in Australia. The Auckland team was largely a junior side though it did feature several more experienced players such as Richard Wynyard, Frank Woodward and Frederick Neighbour. Unfortunately Ferguson broke his leg during the match and had to be taken to the local hospital. The Rotorua side featured Riki Papakura who a week later played for Auckland against Wellington.\nAuckland representative matches played and scorers.\nThe following list includes the four legitimate representative matches against New Zealand Maori, Taranaki (two matches), and Wellington. The Rotorua match is omitted as it was an Auckland Junior/Auckland XIII selection. James Grundy switched from the Ponsonby rugby club at the end of the season and made one appearance for Auckland. It appears that he did not play either code in the following season.\nExhibition matches.\nNorth Shore Albions v City Rovers.\nA photograph of the first ever club rugby league match was published in the New Zealand Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic Review publication on August 5. Frank Woodward is seen bending to tackle an on rushing player. It was played at R. Eagleton's Paddock in Epsom which was close to Alexandra Park. The paddock was located near the south west portion of the intersection of Manukau Road and Greenlane West Road. William Wynyard was the captain of the North Shore side and both he and his brother Richard were the teams coaches. Alfred Jackson played for North Shore and would go on to represent Auckland 23 times and New Zealand 3 times.\nPonsonby United v Newton Rangers.\nJack Stanaway (Hone Haira) coached the sides. There was no scoring published for the match as it was considered a practice game. It was reported that F. Lynch, W. Tobin, and Matthews played well in the backs for Ponsonby, with B. Kean, Warner, and Oakley playing well in the forwards. In the Newton side Will Tobin, and Haswell in the backs, and Oliver, Cole, and Curtis were \"conspicuous\" in the forwards."

Most of the side's matches have been against members of the European Cricket Council (ECC), although in more recent years Norway has fielded sides in the lower divisions of the World Cricket League (WCL).

In September 2018, Norway qualified from Group C of the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Europe Qualifier\nHistory.\nThe first cricket match in Norway was played in 1866, and the Norwegian-born cricketer Buster Nupen played for the South Africa national cricket team from 1922 to 1936. Regardless of endeavours to develop the game at the time in Norway, cricket had everything except vanished by the turn of the century.\nDuring the 1970s, cricket encountered a resurrection in Norway as South Asian migrant workers began playing matches in and around Oslo. Subsequently, the first Norwegian cricket club was established in 1974. The Norwegian Cricket Board was founded in 1994 and, in June 2000, joined with the ICC. In May 2007, The Norwegian Cricket Federation joined the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports.\nToday, there are 67 cricket clubs in Norway with 5000 members combined.

On 20 April 2020, both cricket boards confirmed that the tour had been postponed due to the pandemic.

        "text": "The Zimbabwe cricket team toured Australia in August and September 2022 to play three One Day International (ODI) matches. The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. Zimbabwe last toured Australia in the 2003–04 cricket season to play two Test matches and an ODI tri-series along with India. In May 2022, Cricket Australia confirmed the fixtures for the tour, with all the matches taking place at the Riverway Stadium in Townsville.\nBackground.\nOriginally, the fixtures were scheduled to be played in June 2020, but they were moved to early August 2020 by Cricket Australia. The revised dates clashed with the inaugural season of The Hundred in England, with several Australian cricketers initially expected to take part in the tournament. However, The Hundred was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic also put Zimbabwe's tour to Australia in doubt, but on 28 May 2020, Cricket Australia confirmed the fixtures for the series. The series was put into further doubt in June, after Cricket Australia announced several cost-saving measures. On 20 June 2020, Cricket Australia's interim chief executive officer, Nick Hockley, said that getting clarity on the status of the tour was on his priority list. However, on 30 June 2020, the tour was postponed due to the pandemic.\nIn February 2022, Zimbabwe Cricket were looking at the possibility of playing the matches later that year, with the addition of three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches or a Test match.\nSquads.\nZimbabwe Cricket also named Tanaka Chivanga and John Masara as reserves. Josh Inglis was added to Australia's squad after the first ODI in place of Mitchell Marsh."

        "text": "The India cricket team toured Sri Lanka in July 2021 to play three One Day International (ODI) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. All the matches took place at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. Originally, the tour was scheduled to take place in June 2020, but was moved back to August 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, before being postponed. On 9 July 2021, following an outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the Sri Lankan camp, the series was postponed from 13 to 18 July.\nThe tour overlapped with India's participation in the 2021 ICC World Test Championship Final and a Test series against England. Therefore, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) named Shikhar Dhawan and Bhuvneshwar Kumar as India's captain and vice-captain respectively for the matches against Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) named Dasun Shanaka as the captain for tour, with their selectors releasing Kusal Perera from his captaincy role.\nIndia won the first ODI by seven wickets, and then won the second ODI by three wickets, to take an unassailable lead in the series. Sri Lanka won the third ODI by three wickets, with India winning the series 2–1. India won the first T20I by 38 runs. The second T20I was postponed by one day, after India's Krunal Pandya tested positive for COVID-19. All eight of Pandya's close contacts tested negative for COVID-19, but were not allowed to travel to the ground for the final two matches. Sri Lanka won the second T20I by four wickets to level the series. Sri Lanka won the third T20I by seven wickets and won the series 2–1. It was the first time that Sri Lanka had won a T20I series against India. It was also Sri Lanka's first bilateral series win against India across all formats of international cricket since August 2008.\nBackground.\nIn May 2020, Sri Lanka Cricket sent an email to the BCCI requesting for the series to be played in July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also suggest the possibility of playing the matches behind closed doors. The BCCI responded saying they were open to travelling to Sri Lanka, as long as there is no compromise to the wellbeing of their cricketers. However, they also stated that the tour was \"close to impossible at present\", and they would have to wait to see how the pandemic unfolds. On 18 May 2020, Ashley de Silva, the CEO of Sri Lanka Cricket, confirmed that the tour had not yet been postponed. At the end of May, Sri Lanka Cricket named a 13-man squad to begin training at the Colombo Cricket Club. In June 2020, the BCCI agreed to tour Sri Lanka in August 2020, subject to government permission. On 12 June 2020, the BCCI confirmed that it had called off the tour due to the pandemic.\nIn May 2021, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly confirmed that India would tour Sri Lanka to play five T20Is, although later the BCCI wanted to reduce it to a three-match series. However, as the tour may ease the financial loses faced due to COVID-19 pandemic by boosting Sri Lanka Cricket's revenue, the board asked the BCCI to play five T20Is instead of three. On 20 May 2021, the BCCI considered the request, and agreed to play five T20Is. However, on 10 June 2021, Sri Lanka Cricket confirmed the tour itinerary with only three T20Is. On 8 June 2021, Rahul Dravid was named as the head coach of India's team for the tour.\nSquads.\nIndia did not name individual squads for the ODI and T20I matches, opting instead to name a combined squad of 20 players for the tour. Ishan Porel, Sandeep Warrier, Arshdeep Singh, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, and Simarjeet Singh were also named as net bowlers. Prior to the second T20I match, all five net bowlers were added to India's squad, following the COVID-19 cases that resulted in the match being postponed. Krunal Pandya, Hardik Pandya, Suryakumar Yadav, Prithvi Shaw, Deepak Chahar, Krishnappa Gowtham, Ishan Kishan, and Yuzvendra Chahal were all placed into isolation and were ruled out of the final two matches of the tour.\nAhead of the series, Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews requested not to take part in the tour due to personal reasons. On 9 July 2021, Sri Lanka named a preliminary squad of 25 players for the tour. As per India, Sri Lanka also did not name individual squads for each format, naming a combined squad of 24 players for the tour. Suminda Lakshan was added to Sri Lanka's T20I squad as cover for Wanindu Hasaranga, who suffered an injury in the third ODI. Prior to the second T20I match, Sadeera Samarawickrama was added to Sri Lanka's squad.\nStatistics.\nMost wickets (T20I).\nSouth African cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2021"

The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. It was the first bilateral ODI series between the two teams.\nBackground.\nPakistan were originally scheduled to tour the Netherlands in July 2020 to play three ODI matches, ahead of their tour of England. It would have been the first bilateral series between the two sides. Pakistan were also scheduled to play a two-match Twenty20 International (T20I) series against Ireland following this series. However, on 22 April 2020, the Dutch government announced that it had banned all events in the country, both sports and cultural, until 1 September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands.\nIn April 2022, both the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Royal Dutch Cricket Association (KNCB) agreed on rescheduling the series for August 2022. Later the same month both cricket boards agreed the itinerary for the tour, with all the matches taking place in Rotterdam."

        "text": "The 1885 Belmont Stakes was the 19th running of the Belmont Stakes, a race that would become the third leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series. Run on June 6, 1885, it was the 19th time the event was held at Jerome Park Racetrack in The Bronx, New York. The race drew six starters and was won easily by Tyrant who beat George L. Lorillard's runner-up St. Augustine by three lengths, with third place going to Preakness Stakes winner Tecumseh owned and trained by Charles Littlefield Sr. Heavily favored, Tyrant's winning time was 2:43 flat over a distance of 1½ miles on a dirt track which was rated as good. The \"Breeder and Sportsman\" report on the race stated that \"Tyrant won the race in the most easy manner possible.\"\nBackground to the big race.\nIn 1884, the two-year-old Tyrant was conditioned for racing on the Rancho Del Paso's three-quarter mile training track but it was decided that the colt was not yet ready for the rigors of competition. As such, Tyrant only began his racing career as a three-year-old in 1885.\nTo be prepared and able to compete at racetracks in the New York City area, Tyrant and six other horses along with jockey Patsy Duffy and trainer William Claypool had traveled for 13 days from Rancho Del Paso Stud in Sacramento County, California. The New York racing community marveled at the excellent condition of the seven horses which had been shipped by rail transport in a boxcar specially built for Rancho Del Paso owner James Ben Ali Haggin.\nTyrant soon showed how good he was with a win in the important Withers Stakes at the Jerome Park track. As reported by the \"Breeder and Sportsman\", Tyrant was trained by William Claypool and the win in the Withers Stakes marked the first time a California horse with a California trainer had won a major race for three-year-olds on the East Coast. About the Belmont Stakes, the \"Breeder and Sportsman\" wrote that \"out of the original entry of sixty-two horses there were only six left in, most of them having been frightened by Tyrant's victory in the Withers.\"\nMiss Palmer was the only filly in the field and was in last place shortly after the race began and remained there until the end. While the filly had won the Ladies Stakes on the same track as the Belmont, and had done it impressively, that was just seven days before the Belmont Stakes."

        "text": "The mixed 4 × 400 metres relay at the 2019 World Athletics Championships was held at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha from 28 to 29 September 2019.\nSummary.\nThis was the first time for this event in the World Championships. In the first heat, Tyrell Richard and Nathon Allen handed off virtually even for the United States and Jamaica respectively. Jessica Beard ran a fast first turn to close the door on Janieve Russell to give USA the lead at the break. Beard's 51.2 leg put a 5 metre gap on Russell before she handed off to Jasmine Blocker who let the lead shrink to GBR's Emily Diamond before opening up the gap again on the home stretch, her leg in 51.27. Behind them, Salwa Eid Naser ran Bahrain from well off the pace back into contention. Holding a 5 metre lead, Obi Igbokwe ran strong as Martyn Rooney for GBR, Javon Francis for Jamaica and Abubaker Abbas for Bahrain all closed the gap on the home stretch. USA crossed the finish line first in 3:12.42, barely ahead of the blanket finish of Jamaica 3:12.73, Bahrain 3:12.74 and GBR 3:12.80, the four fastest times in the short history of this event, including USA's world record, in a qualifying heat. The previous world record holding and world leading team from Poland won the second heat.\nIn the final, USA brought in four fresh athletes. From the gun, Wilbert London took the early lead with Muhammed Anas putting India into second position, making up the stagger on Musa Isah from Bahrain. As London came in to hand off, he ran up and almost passed Allyson Felix still in the lead. Running their second man, Poland's Rafał Omelko made up the gap and passed Felix before the break. As Omelko ran away, Felix still held a two metre gap over Jamaica's Roneisha McGregor. Poland's women were also fresh. Iga Baumgart-Witan took the baton with a 50 metre lead for Poland with USA's Courtney Okolo ahead of Jamaica's fresh legs Tiffany James in hot pursuit. On the final turn of the leg, Okolo's 49.9 separated from James as Poland's lead shrunk slightly while again Eid Naser was running Bahrain back into contention. Justyna Święty-Ersetic took the baton in the lead, but with a 10 metre gap on Jamaica, Michael Cherry smelled blood. It took him 150 metres to pass Święty-Ersetic, USA was clear of the field and on to victory. Behind them Abbas ran Bahrain around Rooney in the first turn, chasing Francis. Święty-Ersetic was able to hold the other teams off until the home stretch but then Jamaica, Bahrain and at the line GBR passed her with Abbas diving in vain at the finish to try to catch Francis for silver before crashing to the track.\nIn the end, the first five teams beat the world record from the previous evening. USA's 3:09.34 took over three seconds off their own world record. Bahrain and Great Britain set continental records, while Jamaica, Poland and Belgium set national records. Coming off of childbirth merely 10 months earlier, Felix's 50.4 leg was critical to USA's win. Already the World Championship medal leader, Felix's 12th gold medal surpassed Usain Bolt as the all time gold medal winner. Later in the meet, Felix added an additional gold running the preliminary round of the 4x400 relay, her 13th.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualify for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 29 September at 22:35."

        "title": "1949 Rhodesia vs New Zealand rugby union match",
        "text": "In 1949, Rhodesia played a rugby union match against New Zealand (colloquially known as the All Blacks) as a part of the 1949 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa. The match was played on 27 July 1949 at Hartsfield Rugby Ground in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia. The final result was Rhodesia 10–8 New Zealand. As of 2019, this is the only time the All Blacks have been beaten by a non-Test nation and makes Rhodesia one of only eight countries to have won against the All Blacks.\nBackground.\nRugby in Northern and Southern Rhodesia was governed on an all-Rhodesia basis by the Rhodesia RFU but they were treated as a province of South Africa for rugby reasons and their players were eligible for selection by the South African team. In 1949, the All Blacks visited Rhodesia as a part of their tour of South Africa. The New Zealand team's management for the tour had been troubled due to sailing to South Africa on a ship with little space to train, the team not bringing any Māori players due to South Africa's recently introduced apartheid laws and the fact there was no formal tour coach. The team also travelled with only ten capped players and were led by Fred Allen. As a result of there being no Māori players, the All Blacks did not perform their traditional haka before any match in protest with manager Jim Parker explaining \"The war cry is a creation of the Māoris and as we have no Māoris with us we are not giving the war cry.\"\nMatch.\nThe match was played at Hartsfield rugby ground in front of 10,000 spectators. In the first half, Rhodesia opened the scoring with a try from J.A. Brink after a grubber kick into the All Blacks' in-goal area, which was converted by Ed Karg. In the second half, Rhodesia scored another try by John Morkel stealing the ball from the New Zealand fullback Jack Goddard and passing it to Claude Jones for the second try which Karg also converted. The All Blacks responded with a try from Eric Boggs, which was converted by Goddard. They then scored another try from scrum-half Bill Conrad which Goddard was unable to convert. Rhodesia then continued with attacking tactics and held out for a 10–8 victory.\nAftermath.\nAfter the match, John Morkel was carried off on the shoulders of the crowd and stated \"It is not often Rhodesia does a thing like this\". Allen accepted defeat graciously stating \"So far as Rhodesia's win was concerned, they deserved every bit of it and I can tell you that we shall be flat out to reciprocate on Saturday\". Rhodesian folklore later ascribed the victory to the mythical \"Shangani Mermaids\" who supposedly made it harder for visiting rugby teams once they had crossed the Shangani River. The teams met three days later in Salisbury for a second game, which resulted in a 3–3 draw. On the way back to South Africa after the Rhodesian games, the All Blacks' train crashed into another train, killing one local Rhodesian railway worker and injuring one All Black. The All Blacks went on to lose the South Africa Test series 4–0 and Rhodesia scored two of the seven tries the All Blacks conceded through the whole tour. Rhodesia never won another game against a touring side before being reconstituted as Zimbabwe in 1980."

        "text": "The 2015 Eden World Women's Snooker Championship was a women's snooker tournament that took place at the Northern Snooker in Leeds, England, from 18 to 21 April 2015. The event was the 2015 edition of the World Women's Snooker Championship first held in 1976. The event was won by Hong Kong's Ng On-yee, who defeated Emma Bonney 6–2 in the final.\nThe competition was sponsored by Eden Resources.\nBackground.\nThe event featured eight groups of four or five players each, with the top two players from each group progressing. The event was split after the group stage, with players not reaching the main knockout tournament competing in a parallel \"Plate\" tournament. Matches in the group stage were three . The first knockout round was best-of-five frames; the quarter-finals and semi-finals the best-of-seven, and the final was played as a best-of-11.\nThirty-three players, from ten different countries, participated in the main tournament, as listed in the table below. Seventeen of the thirty-three were English.\nIn the previous six world championships, four different players had reached the final. Reanne Evans had won the title in each of the previous ten years, from 2005 to 2014. The 2014 final had seen Evans Ng On-yee 6–0. World billiards champion Emma Bonney, runner-up in the snooker championship in 2006 and 2011, took part in her first competitive tournament of the season. One notable absentee was Maria Catalano, four times runner-up between 2009 and 2013.\nEvans had recently lost 8–10 to the 1997 men's champion, Ken Doherty, in the qualifying competition for the 2015 World Snooker Championship. Evans' loss meant she was available to compete in the Women's championship.\nPrize money.\nSource: \"Snooker Scene\" magazine, June 2015\nTournament results.\nGroup stage.\nThe qualifying group matches were played on 18 and 19 April 2015. There were eight groups of four players, and one group of five players, with the top two players from each group progressing to the knockout stage. Progression from the groups was determined, in order, by the following criteria: Matches won; Head to head; frames won; Highest ; and finally by ranking position.\nThe event was split after the group stage, with players not reaching the main knockout tournament competing in a parallel tournament called the Plate competition.\nThe only player to complete their qualifying matches without losing a frame was Jaique Ip Wan In. Five players qualified whilst only losing one frame each: Ng On-yee, Reanne Evans, Emma Bonney, Inese Lukashevska and So Man Yan. Jodie Allen, who had only taken up snooker in January 2015 having previously played pool, qualified for the next stage by coming second in her group. Elizabeth Black was the only player not to win a frame.\nEvans scored the highest break of the tournament, 100, in the first frame of her match against Margaret Browne. Jessica Woods made an 85 in the second frame of her match against Evans. These were to be the highest breaks of the tournament.\nLast 16.\nThe two top seeds from qualifying, Jaique Ip Wan In and Ng On-yee, both from Hong Kong, both beat their opponents 3–0.\nFive of the six English players that had qualified for the knockout progressed to the quarter-finals. Defending champion Reanne Evans scored a 69 break during the first frame against Irina Gorbataya, and took the next two to win 3–0. Emma Bonney was 0–2 down to Anna Prisjažņuka, but won the next three to progress into the quarter-finals.\nTatjana Vasiljeva beat her Latvian compatriot 3–1 Inese Lukashevska.\nQuarter-finals.\nVasiljeva took the second frame against Evans to level at 1–1, before Evans won 4–1, with breaks of 65 and 55 during the match.\nOn-yee whitewashed Cunningham 4–0. Ip and Bonney both won 4–2, over Opacic and Poulter respectively.\nSemi-finals.\nBoth semi-finals featured a player from Hong Kong against a player from England.\nBonney lost the first frame against Ip, but won the next four to reach her third world snooker final.\nOn-yee took the first frame against Evans with a break of 44, but Evans then won the next two, with a 38 break in the third, to take the lead. On-yee won a close fourth frame by 53 points to 43, including a 33 break, to level the match at 2–2. On-yee then scored a 55 in taking the fifth frame 84–0, and following a poor safety shot on the brown ball by Evans in the sixth frame, won 51–47 on the black to complete a shock win.\nFinal.\nBonney took an early lead, winning the first two frames. The next six frames were dominated by safety play, and were all won by On-yee, with the only break over 30, a 32, coming from On-yee in the seventh frame. On-yee won the match 6–2 to become the first Asian player to win the title.\nThe frame scores (Bonney first) were: 59–22; 68–38; 11–45; 44–72; 20–72; 14–60; 53–63; 7–72\nIn June 2015, On-yee played 2015 World Snooker Champion Stuart Bingham in an exhibition match in Hong Kong. Bingham won 4–1, with On-yee winning only the fourth frame, 68–41.\nBreaks.\nThere were only eight breaks of over 50, by just three players. The highest break of the tournament was 100 by Reanne Evans, in the first frame of her match against Margaret Browne. The second-highest break was 85 by Jessica Woods in the second frame of her match against Evans. The other player to make breaks over 50 was On-yee with 83, 68, and 55. Evans compiled a 69, a 65 and a 55 as well as her .\nKnockout stage.\nResults of the main draw are shown below. Players listed in bold indicate match winners.\nRelated competitions.\nThe Plate competition was for players who did not reach the main knockout draw, and was held on 20 April 2016. It was won by Jasmine Bolsover, who also made the highest break, 48, in the first frame of her match against Sandra Bryan. Bolsover, aged 15, had been given special permission to take two days off from her GCSE schedule, and received £120 prize money as the winner. Vicky Shirley received £60 as runner-up. Bolsover had recently reached the final of the Connie Gough Memorial ranking tournament, where she lost to Reanne Evans.\nPlate competition winner Jasmine Bolsover also won the under-21 final, and, with Reanne Evans, the Women's Doubles final.

The defending champion and world No. 13 Dafne Schippers and previous silver medalist and world No. 9 Marie-Josée Ta Lou opted not to start in the heats. Olympic champion and world No. 2 Elaine Thompson didn't start in the semi-finals. 2013 bronze medallist and world No. 3 Blessing Okagbare was disqualified in the heats due to a lane infringement. 2013 champion and world No. 7 Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce focused on 100m. The only athlete in the field with a personal best below 22 seconds was Dina Asher-Smith, making her the overwhelming favorite going into the Championships.\nIn the first steps of the final, Asher-Smith took a clear lead, making up the stagger on Dezerea Bryant to her outside just after halfway through the turn. As the stagger resolved coming onto the straight, it revealed Bryant was in second place, slightly ahead of Brittany Brown and Mujinga Kambundji, meaning Asher-Smith had a huge lead. Down the straight, the only athlete looking like she was making any progress cutting down the gap was Brown. \nAsher-Smith didn't let up, crossing the finish line with a clear win by 3 metres, Brown also clearly ahead by another 3 metres over Kambundji. \nAsher-Smith's 21.88 was a new British national record. Kambundji won the first sprint medal for Switzerland at a global outdoor championship. The closest was Marcel Schelbert who also took a bronze in the 400 hurdles in 1999.\nIn the semi-finals, winner Asher-Smith returned to the track to assist an injured rival, Anthonique Strachan, a gesture which earned her a nomination for the International Fair Play Award.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three in each heat (Q) and the next six fastest (q) qualify for the semifinal.\nWind:&lt;br&gt;Heat 1: -0.3 m/s, Heat 2: +0.2 m/s, Heat 3: +0.7 m/s, Heat 4: +0.4 m/s, Heat 5: +0.8 m/s, Heat 6: -0.1 m/s\nSemi-finals.\nThe first two in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nWind:&lt;br&gt;Heat 1: +0.4 m/s, Heat 2: +0.4 m/s, Heat 3: +0.5 m/s\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 2 October 22:35.\nWind: +0.9 m/s"

World leader Shaunae Miller-Uibo did it three times. Salwa Eid Naser broke it once, coming back against a challenge from Aminatou Seyni. Naser was consistently under 51, five times during the 2019 IAAF Diamond League season. Seyni was not allowed to compete in the 400 metres because of the new IAAF testosterone rule. Shericka Jackson was the fourth to break 50 at the Jamaican championships.\nThose athletes were the ones to watch in the final. With multi-toned hair, the tall Miller-Uibo started like she meant business, gaining on the stagger against defending champion Phyllis Francis to her outside and by the backstretch, Francis had already made up the stagger on Justyna Święty-Ersetic to her outside. In the center of the track, Naser had also already made up the stagger on Wadeline Jonathas to her outside. Miller-Uibo and Naser hit the 200 meter split marks virtually even. Through the final turn, Naser was moving faster, opening up 4 metres by the home straight. The first time Miller-Uibo was able to see Naser, she was already behind. That final straight is usually Miller-Uibo's territory. She began stretching out her long strides to reel Naser in. Miller-Uibo steadily gained on Naser, pulling in three metres, but it wasn't enough. Miller-Uibo set a new personal best, 48.37, which became the #6 400 metre race of all time. Naser beat her with 48.14, the #3 400 of all time. Jackson held off the American duo of Jonathas and Francis, all personal bests under 50 seconds. Like all previous top 10 women's races, there were two close competitors battling to the line.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three in each heat (Q) and the next six fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first two in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 3 October at 23:50."

        "text": "The 2019–20 NCAA Division I women's ice hockey season is the 19th season of competition in the National Collegiate division of NCAA women's ice hockey, the de facto equivalent of Division I in that sport. The season began in September 2019 and ended on March 10, 2020 following the conclusion of the ECAC Championship. The 2020 NCAA Division I women's ice hockey tournament at Agganis Arena in Boston which was supposed to be held March 20 and 22 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nChanges from 2018–19.\nThe most significant change from the 2018–19 season was the recognition of the New England Women's Hockey Alliance (NEWHA) as an official NCAA conference. The NEWHA was founded in 2017 as a scheduling alliance by the six schools that then competed as National Collegiate independents—full Division I members Holy Cross and Sacred Heart, plus Division II members Franklin Pierce, Post, Saint Anselm, and Saint Michael's. Holy Cross left after the first NEWHA season of 2017–18 to join Hockey East. Shortly before the 2018–19 season, the remaining five members formally organized as a conference and began the process of gaining full NCAA recognition.\nIn the meantime, LIU Brooklyn had announced that it would add women's ice hockey effective in 2019–20, and would join the NEWHA at that time. Shortly after this announcement, the school's parent institution, Long Island University, announced that it would merge the athletic programs of its two main campuses (Division I Brooklyn and Division II Post) into a single Division I program that would later be unveiled as the LIU Sharks.\nWith the conference membership returning to six for 2019–20, the NCAA officially approved the NEWHA as a Division I conference shortly before the start of that season. This action also meant that there would be no independent programs in that season, since the NEWHA membership included all of the previous National Collegiate independents.\nPlayer stats.\nLeading goaltenders.\n&lt;br&gt;\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nCHA Awards.\nAll-Conference First Team\nAll-Conference Second Team\nAll-Rookie Team"

The 28-year-old Kenyan led the race from start to finish crossing the line in 8 minutes 57.84 seconds setting a championship record. At one point she led the field by 60 metres before defending champion Emma Coburn attempted to reign her in. The American, Coburn, captured the silver medal running a personal best of 9:03.35 finishing four and one-half seconds behind Chepkoech. Germany’s Gesa Felicitas Krause ran 9:03.30 to take the bronze medal for the second time at a world championship event and also set a new national record. Bahrain’s Winifred Yavi just missed the medal podium running a personal best of 9:05.68 to finish fourth.\nTwo other national records were established during the race; Denmark’s Anna Emilie Møller finished seventh with a time of 9:13.46 and Albania’s Luiza Gega ran 9:19.93 to finished ninth. \nRace Details.\nWhen the gun sounded to start the final, Kenya's Beatrice Chepkoech wasted no time stepping off to the lead and quickly establishing an expanding gap between herself and the field; 15 metres by the first barrier, 20 metres in the first lap. This caused a seven-woman pack to form led by Bahrain's Winfred Yavi with top challengers Hyvin Kiyeng, defending champion Emma Coburn, and Peruth Chemutai tucked in behind Yavi. The pack was running at a brisk pace, too, but after one kilometre found themselves seven seconds behind Chepkoech.\nChepkoech covered the first kilometre in 2:52.95. She ran her second kilometre in 3:02.34 for a 2,000 metres time of 5:55.28.\nAt the 6:34 mark Chepkoech opened up a 60 metre lead over the field. Thirty seconds later, at the 7:04 mark, the American Coburn would make a bold move to separate herself from the pack and chase down the leader. The defending champion ran her final kilometre in 2:57 cutting Chepkoech lead by one-half, but it was too great a distance to overcome finishing four and one-half seconds behind the leader.\nChepkoech ran the final kilometer in 3:02.56 to finish at 8:57.84, capturing gold and establishing a championship record.\nFresh off her 2000 metres steeplechase world record a month earlier, Gesa Felicitas Krause ran a spectacular final lap passing two runners, Kiyeng and Yavi, to pick up the bronze medal.\nCoburn improved her standing to #8 of all time fastest women's steeplechase list. Krause set her German national record and moved to #9 on the list; Yavi moved up to #11. Anna Emilie Møller set a Danish national record in her preliminary heat and then improved upon it in the final. Finally, Luiza Gega set an Albanian national record.\nOf note, at the 6:26 mark and then in fifth place, Kenya's Celliphine Chespol withdrew from the race; she crossed over a water jump and appeared to have injured herself. \nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 6 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 30 September at 21:50."

The defending champion, silver medalist and 4th place from 2017, the same athletes as the Olympic podium from 2016, were denied entry into this race.\nFrom the gun in the final, Ajeé Wilson ran with purpose to take the lead at the break and control the race. Natoya Goule and Raevyn Rogers fell in line behind her. Around the second turn, Halimah Nakaayi ran around Rogers who slowed to become a blocking force in the pack, dropping back as far as next to last just after the bell. Winnie Nanyondo led the charge to bridge the new gap behind the three leaders. Down the backstretch, Goule started to challenge Wilson. Wilson ran hard to hold her off. Instead Goule was passed by the two Ugandans, Nakaayi on the inside and Nanyondo on the outside. Through the final turn Nakaayi worked her way up to Wilson's shoulder, shadowed by Nayondo. The diminutive Nakaayi executed the classic pass off the turn. Wilson had no answer. Nayondo was not gaining, but from seventh place at the head of the home stretch, Rogers was sprinting down lane 4, passing Nayondo, passing Wilson and getting to within a metre of Nakaayi before the finish.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 6 fastest (q) advanced to the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first 2 in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 30 September at 22:10."

In the final, they started at 4.50 m but jumped next to 4.70 m, taking the field down to a dozen, nine still with clean rounds. At 4.80 m, six were over, but only Anzhelika Sidorova and Sandi Morris were still clean. At 4.85 m, defending and Olympic champion Katerina Stefanidi missed once, while Morris and Sidorova remained clean. Angelica Bengtsson, Alysha Newman, and Holly Bradshaw could not get over the bar. Bradshaw saved one attempt for 4.90 m but missed, and then Stefanidi missed. When Morris and Sidorova cleared on their first attempts, Stefanidi saved her two remaining attempts for 4.95 m. At this height, only three women had ever cleared , one of them Morris, who had done it four times. Through the first two rounds of attempts, nobody cleared, eliminating Stefanidi with the bronze. On her final attempt, Morris missed. Then, Sidorova cleared. The tie was broken, and Sidorova became only the fourth woman in history to clear 4.95 m.\nMorris congratulated her opponent after the winning vault, an act which earned her a place on the shortlist for the International Fair Play Award that year.\nThe final is noted as one of the best finals in the history of the World Championships. Six women cleared 4.80 m, a record for the event. Prior to 2019, the maximum number of women who cleared 4.80 m in a World Championship final was three, in 2013 and 2015. In fact, the winning height of 4.95 m would have won all previous World Championships except for 2005 when Yelena Isinbayeva won with a then-world record of 5.01 m.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: 4.60 m (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q).\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 29 September at 20:01."

The newest member Karyna Demidik saved one attempt, but missed. First over was defending champion Mariya Lasitskene, who still had a clean round going. That was matched by Vashti Cunningham also maintaining a clean round. After two misses, returning silver medalist Yuliya Levchenko made it over. Returning bronze medalist Kamila Lićwinko was not so lucky and exited the competition. Next up newly tied U20 record holder Yaroslava Mahuchikh got over.\nAt 2.02m, Lasitskene continued her perfect series. Cunningham missed, and then Mahuchikh got over to set a new U20 record. Neither Levchenko or Cunningham could get over, leaving Cunningham with the bronze. At 2.04m, Lasitskene still remained perfect. After two misses, Mahuchikh got over again, setting a second new U20 record in the same competition; a 4 cm personal improvement. That was it, as Lasitskene had the advantage. Mahuchikh, with silver in her pocket, chose not to continue for a third personal best.

But those were back in 2011 and 2012. He finished second behind Wayde van Niekerk's world record at the last Olympics. van Niekerk couldn't be here because he ruined his knee in a celebrity rugby game and James was battling Graves' disease, the same ailment that affected Gail Devers. With a faster personal best, American champion Fred Kerley had been anticipated as USA's next golden boy until Michael Norman came on the scene with a relaxed, early season personal best that only equalled the #4 time in history. But Norman took himself out of the final, jogging home the second half of his semi-final. The other sub-44 qualifiers were Steven Gardiner, who had run his on this track in May and Akeem Bloomfield, who was the last time qualifier to get in. Gardiner led the qualifying, while Anthony Zambrano had to set a Colombian national record to get in.\nIn the final, James went out hard, passing Zambrano to his outside as they entered the backstretch. Inside of James, Machel Cedenio, James, Gardiner and Demish Gaye were running true to the stagger. James held that lead until midway through the final turn when he began to fade back as Gardiner was emerging slightly ahead. Coming onto the home straight, Gardiner held a 2 metre lead over James and Kerley, with Cedenio just slightly behind them. A further 2 metres back was Zambrano and Gaye. Down the stretch, Gardiner widened his lead, with Kerley the next best to chase. From far back, Zambrano was in another gear, speeding past Cedenio, James and a metre before the line, Kerley. \nGardiner's big win in 43.48 is the #6 time in history. Zambrano's 44.15 set the South American record, beating Sanderlei Parrela's record from the World Championships 20 years earlier.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 45.30.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three in each heat (Q) and the next six fastest (q) qualified for the semifinal.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first two in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 4 October at 22:20."

Down the first home stretch the rest of the field back off the fast pace, but Brazier stuck right behind Vázquez through a 48.96 first lap. The real surprise was noted kicker Amel Tuka was at the front of the chase pack, separating through the penultimate turn in chase of the leaders. When they hit the backstretch, Brazier went around Vázquez, who was showing the signs of the strain. By 600 metres in 1:15.16, Brazier had two metres on Vázquez, who had two metres on Tuka. Through the final turn, Brazier held the same gap on Tuka, but Vázquez faded. Ferguson Rotich was the next contender, three metres back, the rest of the chasers another six metres behind him. Down the stretch, Brazier was straining, pumping his arms, but Tuka's famed kick was not making up any ground. 40 metres out, Rotich passed Vázquez, but from far off the pace, Bryce Hoppel was gaining fast. Brazier crossed the line and raised his arms in celebration.

        "text": "The men's 1500 metres at the 2019 World Athletics Championships was held at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha from 3 to 6 October 2019.\nSummary.\nIn modern history, championship races are slow strategic affairs where fast athletes are unwilling to sacrifice their medals by running a fast pace. Fast races happen in more controlled environments with planned pace setters at major European meets.\nTimothy Cheruiyot didn't get the memo. From the gun, Cheruiyot and his Kenyan teammate Ronald Kwemoi went out hard, breaking away by 2 metres in the first 200. The guys who usually drop to the back realized this was serious and started scrambling to the front. Olympic gold medalist Matthew Centrowitz Jr. and silver medalist Taoufik Makhloufi formed a chase group 5 metres back, Jakob Ingebrigtsen leading the peloton another 5 metres back. Over the next lap, the chasers fell back to the peloton, the breakaway now 10 metres. Cheruiyot kept up the pressure, over the next half lap, Kwemoi fell off his back. By the bell, Kwemoi was back to the peloton, again led by Makhloufi. The next on the front were Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr. It appeared a more mature 23 year old Cheruiyot had learned from his fast early pace at the 2015 World Relays where he fell apart on the last lap. Here, there was no sign of letting up. Down the backstretch, coming from 9th place, Marcin Lewandowski ran around the outside of the pack, hitting Makhloufi's shoulder by the beginning of the final turn. The other competitors were already fully extended and couldn't make any dramatic moves. Cheruiyot crossed the finish line 17 metres ahead of Makhloufi. Lewandowski was able to stay a metre behind Makhloufi, trying to nudge ahead in vain at the finish line. The others fell off the back with only Ingebrigtsen remaining two metres behind Lewandowski and Jake Wightman yet another metre back.\nWhile 3:29.26 was \"only\" the 57th best performance ever, it was the third fastest Olympic or World Championship performance, only bettered by the 1999 championships when the number 2 miler ever, Noah Ngeny chased world record holder Hicham El Guerrouj to the championship record, and unlike that race, this was done off the front, solo.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 3:36.00 or 3:53.10 for the mile.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first six in each heat (Q) and the next six fastest (q) qualified for the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first five in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 6 October at 19:40."

        "text": "The men's 5000 metres at the 2019 World Athletics Championships was held at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha from 27 to 30 September 2019.\nSummary.\nThe semi-final heats were held on Friday, in which all three Ethiopian athletes qualified for the final. All three Norwegian athletes also qualified, after European Champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen successfully appealed a disqualification for stepping past the curb of the track during his heat. In the first heat, Aruba's Jonathan Busby was struggling to finish the distance. Braima Suncar Dabó of Guinea-Bissau, who had already finished the race, returned to help his fellow competitor over the finish line, winning applause from the crowd and a nomination for the International Fair Play Award.\nDuring the final, the Ethiopians employed effective team tactics by taking early control of the race, setting a strong pace, and switching leaders once every two laps. Defending Champion Muktar Edris darted out to the front, with his teammates Selemon Barega and Telahun Haile Bekele following closely. Olympic silver medalist Paul Chelimo and his teammate Hassan Mead of the U.S. stayed close as well, along with Canadian-record holder Mohammed Ahmed, Kenyans Jacob Krop and Nicholas Kimeli, and Bahraini athlete Birhanu Balew. Initially, the Ingebrigtsen brothers stayed towards the rear of the leading group, and even briefly lost contact with the front - presumably to conserve energy until the swift early pace had settled down.\nThe Ethiopian team aggressively defended their lead throughout the first 4000m of the race and switched leaders once every 800 meters like clockwork. Edris took the lead for the first two laps, running the first lap in a quick 61.5 seconds, and a slower second lap of 65.9 seconds. At 800 meters, his teammate Bekele took over the lead and increased the pace. At 1600m, Barega went to the front and continued pushing the fast pace that his teammates had set. After 2400m, Bekele took the lead again. The pace began to decrease slightly, despite that it was still quick enough for Bekele to bring the pack through 3 kilometers in 7:53.0. This allowed the Ingebrigtsen brothers to catch up to the leading group and start moving up through the pack. Chelimo (and briefly, Filip Ingebrigtsen) led for less than one lap, before Barega recaptured the lead around 3400m. The fast pace was continuing to slightly decrease as Barega led the pack for one more lap. With three laps to go, and as the pace slowed, Ahmed moved to the front and tried make a long run for the finish line.\nThe final kilometer of the race was extremely hectic. The athletes were positioned far too close to each other, considering how quickly and aggressively they were running. For the next two laps, the athletes consistently bumped into one another, clipped each other's heels, and lost their balance - with some competitors pushing and almost falling over each other. Between 1000 and 600 meters remaining, Ahmed attempted to escape the chaos by injecting a brutal 59.9 second lap. The other athletes, however, were unrelenting and stuck to Ahmed like glue. Ahmed visibly threw his arms up in frustration after the other athletes continued to clip his heels and prevent him from running the inside line despite his vicious sub-60 lap. Heavily affected by the fast pace and physical contact with other athletes, Filip Ingebrigtsen dropped out with 550m remaining, which left Jakob Ingebrigtsenas the remaining Ingebrigtsen sibling in contention for a medal. As he chased Ahmed on the penultimate straightaway, he clipped Ahmed's heels once more, causing him to almost trip and fall.\nOn the final lap, Jakob Ingebrigtsen made an early, aggressive move to the front. Chelimo attempted to stay with him. Ahmed, Barega, and Edris were all wise to this error, and did not challenge Ingebrigtsen as aggressively as Chelimo did. Barega and Edris passed Ahmed as they began winding up their pace in preparation for their final attack. As Ingebrigtsen and Chelimo began running out of steam off of the final bend, Barega passed them first, with Edris coming wide on the outside. Edris sprinted past Barega to defend his title, with a final lap of 55 seconds. Ahmed and Bekele passed Ingebrigtsen and Chelimo for the third and fourth place, respectively. Evidently suffering from his early move, Jakob Ingebrigtsen was slowing rapidly, and dove at the finish line for a very close fifth place. He then laid on the track, visibly exhausted.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 13:22.50.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat (Q) and the next 5 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 30 September at 21:20."

Here the Kenyan team of Rhonex Kipruto and Rodgers Kwemoi took to the front to keep the pace fast and returning silver medalist Joshua Cheptegei, who was a favorite after the track retirement of Mo Farah, was also near the front. By the 5,000 metre mark at 13:33.20 (27:07 pace), only 10 had fallen off the back. Nine laps later, Cheptegei took over the front and two more fell off the back, though Hagos Gebrhiwet, Yemaneberhan Crippa and Lopez Lomong were barely hanging on to the fast-pace. Behind Cheptegei, the 19 year old Kipruto and the tall figure of the new indoor mile record holder Yomif Kejelcha looking like he was waiting to unleash that shorter distance speed. After Mohammed Ahmed fell off the back with 500 meters to go, the group was still five, single file, with Cheptegei still leading the race. Running through traffic at the bell, Kwemoi and Andamlak Belihu couldn't keep up and it looked like the medalsts were decided. Down the final backstretch, Kejelcha moved right onto Cheptegei's shoulder then into a slight lead. The gap left Kipruto running for bronze. As they entered the final turn Cheptegei kept Kejelcha on his outside, while he ran the shorter distance along the inside. Coming off the turn, Cheptegei had the speed, separating slightly from Kejelcha, growing to a 5 metre lead by the finish and claiming gold.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 27:40.00.\nOnly 18 qualifiers did it in the period: Onesphore Nzikwinkunda (BDI) 28:11.90, Rodrigue Kwizéra (BDI), and Thierry Ndikumwenayo (BDI), were qualified during Cross Country Championships (top finishing position at designated competitions – automatically qualifies, irrespective of whether his performance has reached the Entry Standard).\nSoufiane Bouchikhi and Yeman Crippa were invited to complete the event for Ranking.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nThe race started on 6 October at 20:04."

        "title": "2022 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships",
        "text": "The 2022 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships were the 46th edition of the Ice Hockey World Junior Championship, played from August 9 to 20, 2022 at Rogers Place in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\nThe tournament was originally scheduled to be held from December 26, 2021, through January 5, 2022, in Edmonton and Red Deer — the host cities originally awarded the 2022 tournament before it was moved into a \"bubble\" behind closed doors in Edmonton due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After COVID-19 outbreaks on multiple teams, the tournament was cancelled by the IIHF on December 29, 2021. In February 2022, it was announced that the tournament would be replayed from scratch at a later date, with all statistics and results from the first playing being thrown out. Once again, the tournament was held exclusively in Edmonton.\nThis marked the 17th time that Canada hosted the WJIHC. Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia was suspended from international ice hockey and replaced by Latvia (which was promoted to the tournament's top division after finishing second in the Division I-A tournament in December 2021). The country notably achieved its first-ever victory in a preliminary game. In the gold medal game, Canada beat Finland 3–2 in overtime to win its 19th tournament title.\nBackground.\nPreparations.\nOn March 14, 2019, it was announced that Gothenburg would be the host city. It was to be the first time that Gothenburg has hosted the tournament (having previously hosted the Senior Ice Hockey World Championships twice in 1981 and 2002), and the seventh time that Sweden had hosted the tournament.\nOn September 17, 2020, the IIHF announced that the 2022 tournament would instead be hosted by Edmonton and Red Deer, Alberta as compensation for the 2021 tournament (which was originally to be hosted by both cities) being held behind closed doors exclusively in Edmonton due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It became the 15th time that Canada has hosted the tournament, the fourth time Edmonton has hosted the tournament, and the second time games have been hosted in Red Deer, following the 1995 edition. Gothenburg was re-assigned the 2024 tournament.\nOn December 18, 2021, citing the \"changing epidemiological situation\" involving COVID-19 and Omicron variant, and consultation with the IIHF and Alberta Health Services, Hockey Canada announced that the schedule of pre-tournament games (which was to feature each team playing at least two exhibition games) would be reduced, and moved to December 23. Organizers stated that their goal was to hold a \"safe and successful event,\" and that 90% of tickets had been sold. There were no stated plans to reduce spectator capacity.\nAs a participant in the provincial \"Restrictions Exemption Program\" (REP), Rogers Place could operate at full capacity under Alberta provincial public health orders, but was required to enforce proof of COVID-19 vaccinations. On December 21, as part of public health orders to control Omicron variant, the Alberta government ordered all large venues participating in REP to restrict their capacity to 50% effective December 24. Food and drink consumption was prohibited when seated and during intermissions.\nCancellation and rescheduling of tournament due to COVID-19.\nTeams were required to quarantine if any one member tested positive for COVID-19, resulting in three games being forfeited by December 29. Citing the health and safety of participants, and that the competitive integrity of the tournament had been compromised by the aforementioned forfeits, the IIHF announced that the remainder of the tournament had been abandoned. However, IIHF president Luc Tardif stated during a press conference that a committee would meet in January to discuss the feasibility of resuming the tournament at a later date, and that \"we want to take the next month to think about it and maybe come with a good surprise.\"\nOn February 17, 2022, Tardif announced that the tournament would be rescheduled to mid-August 2022, following the U18 Hlinka Gretzky Cup. The tournament would be replayed from the beginning, with all results and statistics from the first attempt thrown out. Rosters from the first playing of the tournament were grandfathered. The following month, it was announced that the tournament replay had been scheduled for August 9–20, 2022, and that it would be hosted exclusively by Edmonton for the second year in a row. Those who had purchased tickets for the first running of the 2022 tournament, or the 2021 tournament, were given priority access to tickets. With Edmonton focusing on the rescheduled tournament, the 2022 Hlinka Gretzky Cup was hosted exclusively by Red Deer.\nIn condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia was suspended from international ice hockey by the IIHF. It was announced that Latvia—who were promoted to the top division for 2023 after finishing second in the Division I-A tournament—would replace Russia for the tournament replay. Division I-A winner Belarus was also banned from international ice hockey for their support of the invasion.\nSponsorship withdrawals and low attendance.\nDue to the Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal that emerged in June 2022, a number of major entities suspended their sponsorships and support of Hockey Canada, including BDO, Canadian Tire, Imperial Oil, Recipe Unlimited, Scotiabank, Telus, and Tim Hortons. The city of Edmonton withdrew their marketing for the tournament. Sportsnet writer Paul D. Grant suggested that sponsors may had also been given the option to receive refunds on sponsorship purchases they had made for the December 2021 running of the tournament after it was cancelled. Besides a placement for IIHF global sponsor Tissot, there were no in-arena sponsor placements during the tournament, with the boards otherwise containing only images of the tournament emblem and ads for the IIHF's official mobile app.\nOn the eve of the tournament, it was also reported that \"thousands\" of tickets were still unsold, including tickets for games involving Canada—which had typically been a major draw during editions of the tournament hosted by Canada. The summer scheduling of the tournament, high ticket prices, the Hockey Canada scandals, and the removal of Russia, were cited by the press as potential factors. The first day of the tournament saw minuscule crowds, with its first three games having an announced attendance of 430, 376, and 829 respectively. However, this was based on tickets sold, and the actual number of spectators in attendance was believed to be much lower. Canada's games had moderate levels of attendance, ranging from 2,779 for its first preliminary game, to 5,204 for its final preliminary game—a fraction of Rogers Place's hockey capacity of 18,500. The gold medal game had an official attendance of 13,327.\nTop Division.\nMatch officials.\nThe following officials were assigned by the International Ice Hockey Federation to officiate the 2022 World Junior Championships.\nReferees\nLinesmen\nPreliminary round.\n\"All times are local (Mountain Standard Time – UTC-7).\"\nPlayoff round.\nWinning teams will be reseeded for the semi-finals in accordance with the following ranking:\nDivision I.\nGroup A.\nThe Division I Group A tournament was played in Hørsholm, Denmark, from December 12 to 18, 2021.\nGroup B.\nThe Division I Group B tournament was played in Tallinn, Estonia, from December 12 to 18, 2021.\nDivision II.\nGroup A.\nThe Division II Group A tournament was played in Brașov, Romania, from December 13 to 19, 2021.\nGroup B.\nThe Division II Group B tournament would have been held in Belgrade, Serbia, from January 10 to 16, 2022, but it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Czechia won the silver, their first medal since 2005.\nThe venue was originally scheduled to be Novosibirsk and Omsk, Russia, but Russia's hosting rights were pulled in February 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Russia's hosting of the 2023 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships was scheduled to be discussed in a meeting of the IIHF council on February 28, 2022. The IIHF suspended Russia and Belarus from international ice hockey until further notice, and stripped Russia of its hosting rights for the World Junior Championships.\nIn late-March 2022, Sportsnet journalist Jeff Marek reported that the IIHF had considered Canada as a possible host country for the tournament, which would make it the third consecutive World Junior Championship to be hosted in the country (the previous two tournaments have been hosted in Alberta with Edmonton as the main host city, but were held in a \"bubble\" behind closed doors and postponed to August 2022 respectively due to the COVID-19 pandemic). On May 5, the IIHF and Hockey Canada announced that Halifax and Moncton would be the hosts of the tournament, beating out announced bids by Regina/Saskatoon, Ottawa/Quebec City, and London/Waterloo.

        "title": "American Baseball Guild",
        "text": "The American Baseball Guild was a short-lived American trade union that attempted to organize Major League Baseball (MLB) players into a collective bargaining unit in 1946. Created by Robert Murphy, a Harvard-educated labor lawyer from Boston, it failed to take root when Murphy could not convince a two-thirds majority of the Pittsburgh Pirates' active players to authorize a strike before a National League game on June 7, 1946. That summer, MLB owners — also shaken by the Mexican League raids that enticed a handful of American players to \"jump\" their contracts for higher salaries in Mexico — made minor concessions to players and the Guild perished. It was the fourth and last unsuccessful attempt to unionize big-league players before the formation of the Major League Baseball Players Association, founded in 1953 and recognized as their official bargaining unit in 1966.\nBackground.\nThe post-World War II era was a tumultuous period for baseball. In , the first full season after the war ended in August 1945, many players who had been serving in the military resumed, or tried to resume, their pre-war baseball careers. The resulting surplus of talent necessitated a temporary expansion of teams' playing rosters: instead of the normal 25-man quota, teams were permitted to carry 36 players before June 15, and 30 thereafter. Attendance would nearly double 1945's wartime totals, reversing a period of declining turnstile counts that had begun with the advent of The Great Depression in 1930 and kicking off a four-year \"baseball boom\" in both the majors and in minor league baseball.\nBut player salaries remained stagnant. The sudden surplus of players and the expanded rosters simultaneously depressed individual salaries and inflated the payrolls of the 16 clubs. In addition, the impact and duration of the attendance spike could not be foreseen, and several MLB teams (such as the Chicago White Sox, Philadelphia Athletics and Washington Senators) were still owned by budget-constrained former players or their families who had no income sources outside their turnstile receipts. Furthermore, the reserve clause in the standard player contract perpetually bound signees to their respective teams. Capitalizing on this situation, the Mexican League, operating outside the \"Organized Baseball\" sphere and dominated by Jorge Pasquel, its president and most powerful club owner, convinced 18 MLB players to abandon their teams to play in Mexico for higher wages. Some of the exiles, such as Brooklyn Dodgers catcher Mickey Owen and undefeated St. Louis Cardinals starting pitcher Max Lanier, were considered top-flight players; moreover, Pasquel set his sights on future Baseball Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio, Bob Feller, Stan Musial and Ted Williams, and MLB stars like hard-hitting St. Louis Browns shortstop Vern Stephens. Meanwhile, Owen, Lanier and the other \"contract jumpers\" were suspended by Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler.\nOutside baseball, labor disputes broke out in multiple industries, resulting in a wave of strikes. Prominent among these job actions were walkouts by steel and coal workers in Pittsburgh early in 1946.\nFormation of the Guild.\nThis confluence of events led Murphy, a former examiner for the National Labor Relations Board, to form the American Baseball Guild on April 14, 1946, saying: \"I could talk for three days on some of the injustices done to ballplayers by the club owners.\" The Guild announced six stated goals:\nThe reference to \"one-sided\" contracts was an early shot across the reserve clause's bow; however, Murphy declined to make a frontal assault on the provision because he feared \"over-reaching.\" Wrote \"The Harvard Crimson\" in August 1946: \"[Murphy] doesn't believe that the much discussed reserve clause can be completely done away with without benefiting the more affluent clubs. Murphy does not feel, however, that the contract, in its present form, would stand up in a court of law, since it is completely one-sided, binding a player to one team for life, while the club must give him only ten days notice before releasing him.\"\nFailed strike vote.\nEarly in 1946, Murphy began to approach players from some of the 16 major league teams about joining the Guild. He focused on the Pittsburgh Pirates, who played in a union stronghold, as his initial organizing target. His early efforts seemed to point towards success when, according to \"The Sporting News 1947 Baseball Guide &amp; Record Book,\" 95 percent of the Pirates' playing roster took out Guild cards. However, after an initial meeting, Murphy attempted unsuccessfully to bargain with Pirates' president William Benswanger, who was in the process of selling the family-owned team. Benswanger pled with his players to put off bargaining with ownership until the end of the 1946 season. In response, Murphy called for a strike vote on Friday, June 7, when the Pirates were scheduled to play a night game at Forbes Field against the New York Giants. The Guild needed a two-thirds supermajority (24 of the 36 Pittsburgh players voting yes) to authorize the strike.\nBut in a lengthy players-only meeting before the Giants' game, support for the Guild collapsed in the face of the forceful opposition of pitcher Rip Sewell and infielder Jimmy Brown. The strike authorization received 20 yes votes, still a majority, but short by four men of the required 67 percent mandate and indicative of a fatal erosion of the union's early-season strength. The Pirates ignored Murphy as they exited their clubhouse and took the field, where they handily defeated their opponents, 10–5. Said third baseman Lee Handley: \"We played a dirty trick on Murphy. We let him down, and I was one of those who did it.\" Fans in the stands, many of them trade union members, booed the home side for repudiating the Guild. On leaving Forbes Field that night, Brown was roughed up by pro-union fans in retaliation.\nAftermath.\nThe defeat of the strike vote in Pittsburgh dealt the Guild a death blow. Less than two months later, major league owners offered concessions to players: a minimum salary of $5,500, the beginnings of a pension plan, the ability for one elected player representative from each league to appear before them to discuss issues and grievances, and a spring training per diem the players nicknamed \"Murphy Money.\" Murphy decried the formation of what he called a \"company union\", but by the end of the year, the Guild would pass out of existence and Murphy would pass out of public life, saying that the players, having gratefully taken an \"apple\" from MLB owners, \"could have had an orchard.\" Murphy was able to appeal the June 7 matter before the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, but when the Pirates were polled again on August 20, they voted 15–3 against the Guild, with one ballot invalidated and 12 abstentions.\nThe owners and MLB hierarchy ultimately rewarded the two players who led the fight against the Guild. Sewell, still an effective pitcher and a National League All-Star in 1946, received a gold watch from the Commissioner, and was employed by the Pirates as a minor-league manager after he retired from the field in 1949. Brown, in his final year as a big-league player in 1946, managed high-level farm teams in the Pirates' organization in 1947 and 1948, spent three years on the Boston Braves' coaching staff (–), and then returned to the minors to spend 13 more years as a manager for multiple organizations from 1952 through 1964.\nFollowing the formation of the MLBPA and its 1966 recognition as the players' collective bargaining representative, the first successful players' strike occurred during spring training in . A second strike shortened the regular season. The reserve clause, famously challenged by former Cardinals' outfielder Curt Flood in 1970, would survive the Guild by almost three decades until a December 1975 arbitrator's ruling dismantled it and ushered in the era of free agency in Major League Baseball. Since then, MLB experienced lengthy players' strikes in 1981 and 1994–1995."

The matches were all played at The Grange Club in Edinburgh. The fixtures in Scotland made up the third leg of New Zealand's tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland, following a Test series in England and limited overs fixtures in Ireland.\nNew Zealand won the opening T20I match by 68 runs, after Finn Allen scored 101 runs. New Zealand scored their highest team total in a T20I match in the second fixture, with 254/5, with them going on to win by 102 runs and take the series 2–0. New Zealand won the one-off ODI match by seven wickets, with Mark Chapman scoring 101 not out. It was Chapman's first ODI century for New Zealand, after he had previously scored one for Hong Kong in November 2015.\nBackground.\nThe New Zealand cricket team was scheduled to tour Scotland in June 2020 to play a One Day International (ODI) match and a Twenty20 International (T20I) match. It would have been the first time since 2008 that the New Zealand team have toured Scotland. New Zealand were also scheduled to tour Ireland in the same month to play three ODIs and three Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). Originally scheduled to be a one-off ODI match, Cricket Scotland announced the addition of the T20I match in December 2019.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic put the tour in doubt. In April 2020, David White, Chief Executive of New Zealand Cricket, said that the tour would be \"most unlikely\" to happen. Later the same month, Gus Mackay, Chief Executive of Cricket Scotland, said that they were willing to host the matches behind closed doors if necessary. However, the tour was postponed on 15 May 2020 as a result of the pandemic.\nSquads.\nAdam Milne was ruled out of New Zealand's squad due to an Achilles injury with Jacob Duffy named as his replacement."

        "text": "Games played (most often abbreviated as G or GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested. In baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as \"ex ante\" substitutes, whether or not they play; however, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even if he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. In baseball and softball, the second baseman is a fielding position in the infield, commonly stationed between second and first base. The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet, needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly, and must be able to make the pivot on a double play. In addition, second basemen are almost always right-handed. Only four left-handed throwing players have appeared as second basemen in the major leagues since 1950; one of the four, Gonzalo Márquez, was listed as the second baseman in the starting lineup for two games in 1973, batting in the first inning, but was replaced before his team took the field on defense, and none of the other three players lasted even a complete inning at the position. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.\nThe second baseman is frequently the smallest player on the team, and the ability of such smaller players to absorb the impact of play has contributed to many long careers at the position throughout major league history; three-quarters of the second basemen elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame have been under 6' tall. Eddie Collins, the first major league player to appear in 2,500 games at a single position, is the all-time leader with 2,650 career games as a second baseman. Joe Morgan (2,527), Roberto Alomar (2,320), Lou Whitaker (2,308), Nellie Fox (2,295), Charlie Gehringer (2,206), Robinson Canó (2,165), Willie Randolph (2,152), Frank White (2,151), Bid McPhee (2,129), Bill Mazeroski (2,094), Nap Lajoie (2,035), and Jeff Kent (2,034) are the only other second baseman to play over 2,000 games at the position."

The process determined the twelve teams that would qualify for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency initially handed Russia a four-year ban from all major sporting events, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulating lab data and lying to investigators. WADA prohibited the use of the Russian flag and anthem at major international sporting events. However, the Russia national team could still enter qualification, as the ban only applied to the final tournament to decide the world champions. Russia appealed the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which ruled in favour of WADA on 17 December 2020, but cut the ban from four to two years. Had Russia qualified, its players would have been able to use its name, flag and anthem at the World Cup, as a result of the nation's two-year ban expiring on 16 December 2022. However, Russia was later expelled from the tournament due to its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nFormat.\nFIBA Europe was allocated 12 berths at the World Cup. In total, 39 FIBA Europe teams took part in the qualification tournament. The qualification consisted of the following stages:\nPre-qualifiers.\nTeams that did not advance to the EuroBasket 2022 qualifiers took part in the pre-qualifiers round."

He played college football at Michigan and was Michigan's offensive rookie of the year in 2018 and led the 2019 team with 48 receptions for 758 yards.\nEarly years.\nBell was a multi-sport athlete at Park Hill High School in Kansas City, Missouri. As a senior, he caught 89 passes for 1,605 yards and 21 touchdowns, but he was not ranked in the top 1,000 high school football recruits. He originally committed as a basketball player to Missouri State University. After initially receiving no Division I FBS scholarship offers to play football, he was recruited late by Jim Harbaugh and in December 2017 committed to play football for the University of Michigan.\nCollege career.\nBell enrolled at Michigan in 2018. As a freshman, he had eight receptions for 145 yards and two touchdowns, including a 56-yard touchdown reception against Nebraska. At the end of the 2018 season, he received the offensive rookie of the year award.\nAs a sophomore in 2019, Bell led the team with 81 receiving yards against Army, 81 yards against Wisconsin, 83 yards against Rutgers, 98 yards against Illinois, and 82 yards against Penn State. After dropping a game-tying pass in the end zone in the closing minutes against Penn State, Bell received national attention for the angry reaction by a Michigan fan and the subsequent rally of fan support behind him.\nAgainst Michigan State on November 16, 2019, Bell had a career-high 150 receiving yards (117 in the first half) on nine catches. For the 2019 season, he was the Wolverines' leading receiver with 48 receptions for 758 yards. Following the 2019 season, Bell was named an honorable mention all-conference selection by the media.\nIn the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season, he was Michigan's leading receiver for the second consecutive year with 26 receptions and 401 receiving yards.\nBell's 2021 season ended when he sustained a knee injury in the season opener.\nAgainst Indiana on October 8, 2022, Bell caught 11 passes for 121 yards. During the 2022 regular season, Bell was the team's leading receiver for the third time in his career with 62 receptions and 889 receiving yards.\nProfessional career.\nBell was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the seventh round, 253rd overall, of the 2023 NFL draft. He was the last of 9 Wolverines drafted in 2023. \nDuring a Week 3 30–12 victory over the New York Giants, Bell caught his first pass, a 9-yard touchdown reception, from quarterback Brock Purdy. Bell finished the game with two receptions for 24 yards and a touchdown. In Week 18 in a 21–20 loss to the Los Angeles Rams, Bell had a career high 5 targets, thanks to the 49ers sitting their best players due to already clinching the #1 seed in the National Football Conference. He only had one catch, a 5-yard touchdown."

        "text": "George Edward \"Ted\" Morrison (October 11, 1894 – February 15, 1961) was an American college football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Howard University in Washington, D.C. from 1920 to 1922 and again in 1924, and Lincoln University in Pennsylvania compiling a career college football record of 21–14–5. His 1920 Howard Bison football team won the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) title and was recognized as a black college football national champion.\nEarly years.\nGeorge Edward Morrison or Ted as family and friends called him, was born in Chelsea Massachusetts to George and Minnie Morrison. He was an only child.\nMorrison played baseball and football at Everett High School. He then enrolled at Tufts University in 1915.\n As a player for Tufts University during the 1916 season, he was the target of significant racial discrimination. During a game against Princeton, he sustained injuries as the result of dirty play at that hands of Princeton players.\nLater that season, the team had a game at Indiana University. The team's hotel initially denied Morrison and another black teammate a room. In response, Tufts coach Charles Whelan protested and said that if the black players weren't accommodated, he would take his team back to Massachusetts without playing. The hotel quickly acquiesced, and Tufts won the game, 12–10.\nCoaching career.\nFrom 1918 to 1920, Morrison studied dentistry at Howard University in Washington, D.C. He served as the head football coach at Howard from 1920 to 1922 and again in 1924, winning a black college football national championship in 1920.\nMorrison became the head football coach and taught dentistry at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania in 1927.\nLater life.\nHe was first married to Alice Washington, and then married CarLynne Payne in 1924. Dr. Morrison &amp; Carlynne first resided in Washington, DC, where she taught at Paul Lawerence Dunbar HS.  \nIn 1928, after coaching life Dr. Morrison relocated to Philadelphia with his family where he opened his dental practice in North Philadelphia. He resided there with his family for the remainder of his life. He died at his home on February 15, 1961. He was survived by his wife CarLynne, his children Evelyn, Edward, Patrica, William, and many grand and great-grandchildren."

        "text": "The 2019 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented University of Santo Tomas in the 82nd season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The men's basketball tournament for the school year 2019-20 began on September 4, 2019, and the host school for the season was Ateneo de Manila University.\nThe Tigers made it back to the playoffs for the first time since Season 78 after finishing the double round-robin eliminations at fourth place with 8 wins against 6 losses. The FEU Tamaraws had the same win–loss record but were ranked higher on a superior +6 quotient over UST.\nThey then eliminated FEU in the first round of the stepladder semifinals and went on to defeat the second-seeded UP Fighting Maroons who held a twice-to-beat advantage over them in the next round to advance to the Finals against the undefeated Ateneo Blue Eagles.\nThe Blue Eagles went on to sweep the Finals series for an unprecedented 16–0 season and capped a three-peat championship run that began in Season 80. UST, who had nine new players in their roster was the only team to have lost to Ateneo by a solitary point this season. Their first round match ended with a score of 70–71.\nBeninese center Soulémane Chabi Yo was named Most Valuable Player of the season, while former Tiger Cubs' one-and-done and mythical team member Mark Nonoy won the Rookie of the Year award. This was the first time in a decade for players from UST to win the MVP and the Rookie of the Year awards. Dylan Ababou was the MVP, while Jeric Teng was the Rookie of the Year in 2009.\nRhenz Abando, a transferee from Pangasinan's Philippine College of Science and Technology was chosen Player of the Week by the UAAP Press Corps for the duration of September 4–8, while team captain CJ Cansino, who had a season-ending ACL injury the previous year got the citation during the week of October 16–20, 2019.\nSeason records.\nUST had an average winning margin of 12.8 points and an average losing margin of 8.7 points.\nThey had a blowout win over the UE Red Warriors, defeating them 101–73 in the second round of eliminations. Their 101-point output was the highest scored by a team in the season. It eclipsed their opening day record of 95 points which was also against UE. Prior to the game, the Tigers had not scored more than 90 points since Aldin Ayo took over as head coach. It was during the first round of Season 80 when UST scored 91 points in a losing effort to also the Red Warriors on their 11th consecutive loss that dated back to the second round of Season 79.\nUST made a record 49 three-point shot attempts in their opening game against UE, 15 of which were by Abando. The Tigers also have the most number of three-point field goals converted with 16, as well as the highest total field goal attempts made in a game with 95, converting also a record high 39 shots.\nThe team also held the most number of free throw attempts and conversions with 42 and 28 respectively. This was during their second-round game against the Adamson Falcons where both teams committed a combined total of 21 team fouls in the first quarter.\nUST also recorded the fewest turnovers made in a game with 6 during their second-round match against UP .\nRoster changes.\nCameroonian center Steve Akomo has used up his eligibility but is ably replaced by the Beninese Soulémane Chabi Yo, a transferee from Colegio de San Lorenzo who led the Griffins to the 2017 UCBL championship.\nMario Bonleon and Season 81 team captain Marvin Lee decided to forgo their final playing year to join the commercial leagues. Bonleon announced to the team that he was not coming back due to recurring injuries. He had made his decision before the Tigers played their last game of the season. Lee was the team's second leading scorer last season behind Renzo Subido and had played long minutes in UST's preseason games but was advised by their head coach to pursue playing in the MPBL in lieu of his final year in college. His Season 81 scoring average was 14.4 points per game.\nGermy Mahinay and Joshua Marcos also played in the preseason, but both decided to transfer to other schools with Mahinay going to National University and Marcos to College of Saint Benilde. Toby Agustin, who saw limited action last season also transferred to Mapúa University.\nAldin Ayo's twofold rebuilding plan to hold on to players from the UST high school program and to find talents from the countryside could not be any more evident this season with the arrival of UST Tiger Cubs' mythical team member Mark Nonoy, La Union native Rhenz Abando, and Davao City rookie standout Deo Cuajao.\nNonoy himself was scouted while he was in his junior year at Hua Siong College in Iloilo. He was representing Western Visayas in the Palarong Pambansa where he scored 43 points in a game against the Northern Mindanao team. He earlier scored 41 points for Hua Siong in their championship win over Bacolod Tay Tung High School in the 2018 Iloilo Invitational 17 Under Boys Basketball tournament.\nCoaching staff.\nAldin Ayo went into his second year as the head coach of the Growling Tigers, but not without controversies. A rumor that originated from an anonymous tweet in April claimed that Ayo had been fired as coach of the Growling Tigers, but UST's school publication, The Varsitarian later clarified that he was actually giving up his post as consultant of the juniors' basketball program to concentrate on rebuilding the seniors' team.\nThis led Bonnie Garcia to step down from the seniors' coaching staff to replace Ayo in the juniors' program. Garcia is the coach of the UST Tiger Cubs basketball team that placed fifth in Season 81 on a 7–7 win–loss record.\nThe Varsitarian further clarified that Ayo had actually signed a three-year contract and not six years as reported last year.\nAside from Garcia, assistant coach Randy Alcantara also left Ayo's coaching staff after he was selected by the Mapúa University Cardinals senior men's basketball team in December 2018 to replace Atoy Co as their new head coach. Alcantara was the coach of Mapúa's juniors' team who had just won their third straight NCAA championship earlier in November.\nTapped to replace Garcia and Alcantara were former Arellano Baby Chiefs player JR Carlos and former captain of the Growling Tigers Jino Manansala.\nJino, the son of former Philippine Basketball Association Rookie of the Year Jimmy Manansala played under Coach Aric del Rosario alongside Cyrus Baguio, Niño Gelig, Alwyn Espiritu, Christian Luanzon and Emmerson Oreta. He is the current head coach of reigning NAASCU champions Saint Clare College of Caloocan. He has also coached the AMA University Titans and the University of Manila Hawks to the 2006 and 2010 NAASCU championships.\nThis season also saw a change in the team manager position with Jimi Lim of Ironcon Builders replacing Chuck Dumlao of FMR Corporation.\nSchedule and results.\nPreseason tournaments.\nThe Filoil Preseason Cup and the PBA D-League games were aired on 5 Plus and ESPN 5.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format.

Huang was picked 43rd overall by the Luigi Trillo-led Meralco Bolts team, while Caunan ended up with the Johnedel Cardel-coached Terrafirma Dyip team as the 70th pick of the draft on September 17, 2013."

        "text": "The 2022 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, the 67th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 30th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France, on 28 May 2022, between English club Liverpool and Spanish club Real Madrid. It was the third time the two sides have met in the European Cup final, after 1981 and 2018, the third final held at the Stade de France, after the 2000 and 2006 finals, and the first time the same two teams have met in three finals. Real Madrid won the match 1–0 via a 59th-minute goal from Vinícius Júnior (thanks to Federico Valverde's assist) for a record-extending 14th title, and their fifth in nine years.\nThis was the first final to be played in front of a full attendance since the 2019 final, as the previous two finals were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The final was originally scheduled to be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich. After the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final, the final hosts were shifted back a year, so the 2022 final was given to the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, UEFA called an extraordinary meeting of the executive committee a day later, and the final was relocated to the Stade de France. Before the match, chaos descended following issues with crowd control, which led to kickoff being delayed by 36 minutes.\nAs winners, Real Madrid earned the right to play against the winners of the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League, Eintracht Frankfurt, in the 2022 UEFA Super Cup, and also qualified for the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup, in which they both won. The team also qualified for the 2025 expanded FIFA Club World Cup using UEFA's champions pathway (The winners of the 2021-2024 Champions Leagues), with Liverpool increasing their chances of qualifying using the UEFA coefficient pathway (The top 8 clubs qualifying).\nBackground.\nLiverpool played in their 10th European Cup/UEFA Champions League final. They had previously won six finals (in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 and 2019) and lost three (in 1985, 2007 and 2018). This was the fourth UEFA Champions League final for manager Jürgen Klopp, after his loss with Borussia Dortmund in 2013 and the Liverpool finals in 2018 and 2019 the latter of which he won. In addition to their six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, Liverpool also played in one European Cup Winners' Cup final, losing in 1966 against Borussia Dortmund, and in four UEFA Cup/Europa League finals, winning in 1973, 1976 and 2001 and losing in 2016. Their manager Jürgen Klopp was seeking to become the fourth consecutive German to manage a Champions League-winning club.\nReal Madrid played in a record 17th European Cup/UEFA Champions League final, and the first since their win in 2018 against Liverpool. They previously won 13 finals (in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018) and lost three (1962, 1964 and 1981). Their manager Carlo Ancelotti reached a record fifth UEFA Champions League final as manager, winning in 2003 and 2007 and losing in 2005 while in charge of Milan, and winning the 2014 final with Real Madrid, and was seeking to become the first manager in history to win four UEFA Champions League titles and eight European trophies. Real Madrid also played in two European Cup Winners' Cup finals (losing in 1971 and 1983) and two UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1985 and 1986).\nThis was a record-third time that the two teams meet in the final, after the 1981 final, which was held in the Parc des Princes in Paris and in which Liverpool prevailed 1–0, and the 2018 final held at the Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex in Kyiv, which was won 3–1 by Real Madrid. This was also the third final for Carlo Ancelotti as manager against Liverpool, after the 2005 and 2007 finals; he also lost the 1984 final as a player for Roma. This was the sixth time a Spanish side met an English team in the final of the competition, after the 1981, 2006 (won by Barcelona against Arsenal), the 2009 and 2011 finals (both won by Barcelona against Manchester United), and the 2018 final.\nBesides the 1981 and 2018 finals, the two clubs had met each other six times. Liverpool won both matches in the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League round of 16 (1–0 away and 4–0 at home). The two clubs were drawn in the same group in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Real Madrid winning 3–0 away and 1–0 at home. In the 2020–21 quarter-finals, the Spanish side won 3–1 at home and held a 0–0 draw at Anfield to ensure progression to the semi-finals.\nPrevious finals.\n\"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\"\nVenue.\nThe final was originally awarded to the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. When the COVID-19 pandemic forced the 2020 final to be relocated from the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul to the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, the Allianz Arena was reawarded with the 2023 final and the 2022 final was given to the original host of the 2021 final, the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg.\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, UEFA organised an emergency meeting of its executive committee on 25 February, at which it decided to move the final to the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. Other cities proposed as replacement hosts were Amsterdam, Barcelona, Munich and Rome. This was the first UEFA Champions League final to take place in France since 2006.\nHost selection.\nAn open bidding process was launched on 28 September 2018 by UEFA to select the venues of the finals of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Women's Champions League in 2021. Associations had until 26 October 2018 to express interest, and bid dossiers must be submitted by 15 February 2019. UEFA announced on 1 November 2018 that two associations had expressed interest in hosting the 2021 UEFA Champions League final, and on 22 February 2019 that both associations submitted their dossiers by the deadline.\nThe Krestovsky Stadium was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Ljubljana, Slovenia on 24 September 2019, where the hosts for the 2021 and 2023 UEFA Champions League finals were also appointed.\nOn 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee announced that due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, Saint Petersburg would instead host the 2022 final.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nPre-match.\nPromotion.\nThe original logo of the 2022 UEFA Champions League final at Saint Petersburg was unveiled at the group stage draw on 26 August 2021 in Istanbul. Originally, former Russian forward Andrey Arshavin was chosen to be the ambassador for the final. However, he was removed after the final's relocation to Saint-Denis.\nOfficials.\nOn 11 May 2022, UEFA named Frenchman Clément Turpin as the referee for the final. Turpin had been a FIFA referee since 2010, and was previously the fourth official in the 2018 UEFA Champions League final, also between Real Madrid and Liverpool. In the previous season he was the referee for the 2021 UEFA Europa League Final between Villarreal and Manchester United. He officiated eight prior matches in the 2021–22 Champions League season, with two matches in qualification, four in the group stage and two knockout fixtures. He served as a referee at the UEFA European Championship in 2016 and 2020, as well as at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Turpin also was a video assistant referee at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia (including in the final), the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates and the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France\nTurpin was joined by five of his fellow countrymen, including assistant referees Nicolas Danos and Cyril Gringore. Benoît Bastien served as the fourth official. Jérôme Brisard acted as the video assistant referee (VAR), with Willy Delajod appointed as one of the assistant VAR officials, along with Italian referees Massimiliano Irrati and Filippo Meli.\nOpening ceremony.\nCuban-born American singer Camila Cabello performed for the opening ceremony before the start of the match. Cabello performed her songs \"Señorita\", \"La Buena Vida\", \"Havana\", \"Bam Bam\" and \"Don't Go Yet\".\nIssues entering stadium and match delay.\nCrowd control descended into chaos at the entrances to the Stade de France prior to the beginning of the match. By 21:00 local time, the originally scheduled kick-off time, thousands of seats remained empty in the Liverpool end. For \"security reasons\", the kick-off was initially delayed by 15 minutes to 21:15. This was further delayed by 15 minutes to 21:30, before being pushed back another 6 minutes to 21:36. The match eventually started at 21:37.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nThe match kicked off at the delayed time of 21:36 in front of a crowd of 75,000. In the 16th minute, Trent Alexander-Arnold played the ball across the Real Madrid penalty area which ended up being hit towards goal by Mohamed Salah before being saved by Thibaut Courtois for the first effort of the match. Five minutes later, Thiago Alcântara played a ball through to Sadio Mané who managed to make space for himself and take a shot which was saved on to the left post by Courtois. In the 34th minute, Alexander-Arnold played another cross into the Madrid penalty area towards Salah, who managed to direct a header towards goal but straight at Courtois. \nTwo minutes before half-time, Karim Benzema made a clear run towards the Liverpool penalty area on the right and managed to take the ball under control before attempting to pass the ball across before being cut out by Ibrahima Konaté. However, a mix up between the Liverpool defender as well as goalkeeper Alisson allowed Federico Valverde to try and step in to intercept, with Liverpool midfielder Fabinho also forced to intervene. Amongst the attempts to win the ball, it ended up falling to Benzema again who then passed the ball into the net. However, the goal was disallowed initially by the assistant referee and then also by the VAR after a check of three minutes and 20 seconds. Benzema was shown to be in an offside position when the ball came to him, however there was controversy as to whether the last touch off of Fabinho was intentional or not. There were three minutes of stoppage time.\nSecond half.\nNeither side made any lineup changes during the interval. Liverpool continued where they left off, as nine minutes into the second half Alexander-Arnold played in another cross towards the Real Madrid penalty area which was not far from the head of Alcântara and ended up being punched away by Courtois. In the 59th minute, Madrid took the lead against the run of play; Valverde made a run with the ball on the right hand side, before eventually playing a low cross towards Vinícius Júnior in the penalty area who managed to tuck the ball into the net to make it 1–0, having been left unmarked and Alisson left stranded on the other side of the goal.\nFabinho received the first and only booking of the night, after being shown a yellow card in the 62nd minute by referee Clément Turpin for a challenge on Valverde. With 24 minutes remaining, Liverpool pressed for an equaliser. Salah came forward with the ball and tried a shot from just outside the penalty area which ended up being saved to the right side of his goal by Courtois. Liverpool then made their first substitution of the final in the 65th minute, as Luis Díaz came off for Diogo Jota. Liverpool pushed again for a goal as a header across the face of goal by Jota almost found its way towards Salah, but was blocked off by Courtois. Madrid then had a chance to score another in the 75th minute, as a free kick into the Liverpool penalty area by Toni Kroos found its way to Casemiro who then tried to play the ball across towards Benzema and Vinícius, but was collected by Andrew Robertson.\nLiverpool then made their two more changes, as Alcântara and captain Jordan Henderson came off for Naby Keïta and Roberto Firmino in the 77th minute. Liverpool continued to push for the equaliser, as passing took place between Salah and Firmino before Salah took another shot from just outside the penalty area which ended up being deflected off of Jota and carefully beaten away by Courtois down his bottom left. Salah came forward again with eight minutes left, as a ball over the top from Fabinho found its way to the Egyptian who tried to battle off Ferland Mendy before coming across and having his resulting effort be saved by Courtois. Madrid made their first change of the match in the 86th minute, as Valverde came off for Eduardo Camavinga. At the end of regular time, the fourth official displayed that a minimum of five minutes of stoppage time would be played. Madrid made their two other substitutions in stoppage time, as Dani Ceballos came on for Luka Modrić in the 90th minute and goalscorer Vinícius was brought off in the 93rd minute for Rodrygo. Despite Liverpool's continued pushes for a goal in the final moments, the match was brought to an end with Madrid winning 1–0.\nDetails.\nThe \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held after the quarter-final and semi-final draws.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nWith their win, Real Madrid secured a record-extending 14th title in the European Cup/Champions League. The club has won twice as many titles as the next-best team, Milan (7 titles). This was Madrid's fifth title in nine seasons (since 2013–14), their eighth consecutive win in a Champions League final, and their tenth successive victory in a major European final (including the 1985 and 1986 UEFA Cup Finals). Real Madrid has not lost a final in the Champions League era, with their last defeat occurring in 1981. Real Madrid also claimed their fourth European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58 and 2016–17). With the win, Spanish teams extended their streak of 17 straight major European finals won against non-Spanish opposition. Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was selected as the man of the match, having made nine saves in the game, a record in the final since Opta began keeping records in 2003–04. His 59 saves during the campaign also set a new Champions League single-season record since Opta began keeping records.\nCarlo Ancelotti became the first manager to win four Champions League titles, having previously won the 2003 and 2007 tournaments with Milan, and the 2014 title with Madrid. Conversely, Jürgen Klopp tied Marcello Lippi for most losses in Champions League finals. Klopp had previously lost with Borussia Dortmund in 2013 and Liverpool in 2018. Nine players secured their fifth Champions League title with the win, with eight (Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema, Dani Carvajal, Casemiro, Isco, Marcelo, Luka Modrić and Nacho) doing so with Real Madrid's wins in 2014 and from 2016 to 2018. Toni Kroos won his first title with Bayern Munich in 2013, before winning with Real Madrid from 2016 to 2018. They joined former Real Madrid player Cristiano Ronaldo as the only players to have won five titles in the Champions League era."

It was played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, on 10 June 2023, between English club Manchester City and Italian club Inter Milan, with Manchester City winning 1–0 via a second-half goal by Rodri, who was named man of the match by UEFA. For Manchester City, this was their first-ever European Cup, and first European trophy since 1970. Having earlier won the Premier League and FA Cup titles, they achieved the continental treble, only the second time it had been achieved in English men's football history. As winners, Manchester City earned the right to play against Sevilla, the winners of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League, in the 2023 UEFA Super Cup, as well as qualifying for the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup; they went on to win both competitions. They also qualified for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup through UEFA's champions pathway (winners of the 2021–2024 Champions Leagues).\nThe final was originally scheduled to be played at Wembley Stadium in London, England. However, due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scheduled hosts for subsequent finals were shifted back a year, and the Allianz Arena in Munich was assigned the 2023 final. When the 2021 final, which had been scheduled to be played in Istanbul, also had to be relocated due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2023 final was given to Istanbul instead, and Munich received the 2025 final.\nBackground.\nThis was the first meeting in UEFA competitions between Manchester City and Inter Milan. For Manchester City, this was their second UEFA Champions League final appearance since the appointment of Pep Guardiola, and the first since 2021 where they lost 1–0 to Chelsea at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto. Guardiola was looking to win his first UEFA Champions League final since 2011 with former employers Barcelona, when they beat Manchester United 3–1 at Wembley Stadium. Additionally, Manchester City were attempting to secure the continental treble, having earlier won the Premier League and FA Cup titles. On the other hand, this was Inter Milan's sixth UEFA Champions League final appearance, having won 3–1 in 1964 against Real Madrid at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion, 1–0 against Benfica at their home ground the San Siro in 1965 and 2–0 against Bayern Munich at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in 2010 (resulting in Inter completing the continental treble); they also lost 2–1 to Celtic at the Estádio Nacional in 1967 and 2–0 to Ajax at De Kuip in 1972. Manchester City had won six matches against Italian clubs, while Inter had won sixteen matches against English clubs. Inter were hoping to complete a cup double of their own, having earlier won the 2023 Coppa Italia final against Fiorentina.\nPrevious finals.\n\"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era and since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\"\nVenue.\nThis was the second UEFA Champions League final played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium; the first was held in 2005 between AC Milan and Liverpool.\nHost selection.\nAn open bidding process was launched on 22 February 2019 by UEFA to select the 2022 and 2023 UEFA Champions League final venues.

The four officials had all previously officiated together in the World Cup final six months prior. They were joined by fellow countryman Bartosz Frankowski as assistant VAR, with Romanian István Kovács appointed as the fourth official. Some controversy regarding the appointment was raised in early June due to multiple media reports that Marciniak had been present at an event organised by Sławomir Mentzen, a right-wing Polish politician and leader of the libertarian New Hope party. UEFA investigated the incident and subsequently decided to maintain the original refereeing line-up on 2 June, having acknowledged Marciniak's \"profound apologies and clarification\".\nAmbassador.\nThe ambassador for the final was former Turkish international Hamit Altıntop, who was originally the ambassador for 2020 and 2021 finals before those matches were relocated to Lisbon and Porto, respectively.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony before the match, officially known as the \"2023 UEFA Champions League Final Kick Off Show by Pepsi\" for sponsorship reasons, featured Swedish DJ Alesso, Nigerian singer Burna Boy and Brazilian singer Anitta. Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed a special rendition of the UEFA Champions League Anthem as the teams walked out for the match.\nTicketing.\nWith a stadium capacity of 72,000 for the final, a total amount of 47,200 tickets were available to fans and the general public, with the two finalist teams receiving 20,000 tickets each, and with the other tickets sold to fans worldwide via \"UEFA.com\" from 21 to 28 April 2023 in four price categories: €690, €490, €180 and €70. Accessibility tickets for disabled spectators cost €70. The remaining tickets were allocated to the local organising committee, national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters, and to serve the corporate hospitality programme.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nManchester City began the final with Kyle Walker on the bench and replaced by Nathan Aké in the starting line-up in an unexpected change; Inter Milan started Marcelo Brozović in place of Henrikh Mkhitaryan who was returning from an injury. The two sides had scoring chances early in the first half, but Inter's André Onana made two saves to prevent City from taking the lead. A misplayed pass from Ederson in the 26th minute was stolen by Nicolò Barella, but his shot over the goalkeeper missed. Kevin De Bruyne left the match in the 36th minute with a hamstring injury and was replaced by Phil Foden. The first half ended scoreless, with Inter playing defensively to prevent City from gaining momentum.\nRomelu Lukaku was brought on to replace former City striker Edin Džeko early in the second half and immediately produced a chance from a header. In the 59th minute, Ederson failed to collect a backpass from Manuel Akanji which was found by Inter's Lautaro Martínez; his shot from near the touchline was saved by Ederson. Rodri scored the opening goal for City in the 68th minute by finishing a pulled-back pass that Bernardo Silva sent from near the goal to the top of the penalty area. Inter had a chance to equalise three minutes later through a header by defender Federico Dimarco that hit the crossbar. Dimarco tried to capitalise on the rebound as well, but his shot was accidentally blocked by his teammate Lukaku. The Belgian striker had his own chance to score from a close-range header in the 89th minute, which Ederson blocked with his legs. The Brazilian goalkeeper made an additional save in the sixth minute of stoppage time off Robin Gosens's header to preserve a 1–0 victory for City.\nDetails.\nThe \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held after the quarter-final and semi-final draws.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nWith their victory, Manchester City secured their first UEFA Champions League title, the first new winners of the competition since fellow English club Chelsea in 2012. City became the sixth English club, and 23rd overall team, to win the European Cup, which marked the 15th time an English club were champions of the competition. Manchester City also completed the tenth continental treble in European football history, doing so as the eighth overall team and second English club after city rivals Manchester United in 1998–99. It was the 15th occasion a club won the European Cup unbeaten, with City the 11th club to accomplish the feat.\nPep Guardiola won his third Champions League final as a manager after his two titles with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, becoming the second-most successful coach in the competition, behind Carlo Ancelotti's four victories. He also became the first manager to win two European trebles, having also done so with Barcelona in 2008–09. It was Guardiola's twelfth major trophy with Manchester City; after the match, he stated that \"it was written in the stars that we'd win this season—and we did.\" City midfielder Rodri, who scored the lone goal of the game, was selected as the man of the match by UEFA's technical observers. Backup goalkeeper Scott Carson was the only City player to have previously won the competition, doing so as a reserve for Liverpool in 2005 at the same stadium. He thus equalled the record for the longest gap between a first and last European Cup title, shared with Milan's Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta. Forward Julián Álvarez, who won the 2022 FIFA World Cup with Argentina six months prior, became the first player to win the treble and World Cup in the same season. This also made him the tenth player to accomplish the European Cup and World Cup double.\nAs winners, Manchester City qualified for the 2023 UEFA Super Cup, where they defeated Spanish club Sevilla, winners of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League, on penalties following a 1–1 draw after regulation time. City also qualified for two editions of the FIFA Club World Cup: the 2023 tournament held in December with seven teams, and the expanded 32-team tournament in 2025. Following the \"Nerazzurri\" defeat, Italian teams became the first in European football history to finish runners-up in each men's UEFA competition in a single season, including Roma and Fiorentina's losses in the Europa League final and in the Europa Conference League final, respectively."

        "text": "The 2020 Challenge Cup, known as the Coral Challenge Cup for sponsorship reasons, was the 119th staging of the Challenge Cup, the main rugby league knockout tournament for teams in the Super League, the British national leagues and a number of invited amateur clubs.\nThe competition was won by Leeds Rhinos who beat Salford Red Devils 17–16 at Wembley Stadium on 17 October 2020.\nDefending champions Warrington Wolves who won the 2019 title beating St Helens 18–4 at Wembley Stadium on 24 August 2019 were knocked out by Salford in the semi-finals.\nThe format of the competition remained as eight knock-out rounds followed by the final but the schedule was placed into disarray by the COVID-19 pandemic. The final was scheduled to be played on 18 July instead of the August bank holiday weekend. However on 16 March all rugby league games were suspended indefinitely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. The suspension was followed, on 19 May 2020, with confirmation from the Rugby Football League (RFL) of the postponement of the Challenge Cup Final, which had been scheduled for 18 July at Wembley Stadium. The competition did not resume until 22 August with the final to be played on Saturday 17 October.\nEntry.\nEntry into the Cup is mandatory for the English and Welsh professional teams, but is by invitation for all other clubs, either professional or amateur. French side Toulouse declined to enter for 2020, after also declining to play in previous years. Canadian side Toronto Wolfpack rejoined the competition after declining to play in the 2019 competition and by agreement would play all their matches in away from home. Serbian club, Red Star who played in 2019 declined an invitation to enter in 2020 due to the demands the trip to England made on their players.\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 16 March 2020, the RFL announced that all rugby league games had been suspended initially, until at least April, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, on 24 March, rugby league clubs held a board meeting via conference call, attended in part by senior officials of the Rugby Football League, for further discussion of how to respond to the current public health crisis. It was agreed that until further notice, all rugby league fixtures would be suspended indefinitely.\nThe competition recommenced with the rescheduling of the sixth round on 22 August, after the RFL announced that rugby league could return from 2 August but with all games to be played behind closed doors. The pandemic caused Toronto Wolfpack to withdraw from the competition on 20 July, and just over a week later, on 28 July, the remaining Championship and League 1 clubs also withdrew from the competition. These withdrawals caused the RFL to reconsider the structure of the competition as only 10 Super League clubs remained in the competition. The decision was made to redraw and restructure the sixth round to comprise just two fixtures with only four teams, with the remaining six teams automatically receiving byes to the quarter-finals.\nThe suspension of the competition also raised some uncertainty about the availability of Wembley as the venue for the final and it was not until 22 September that Wembley was re-confirmed as the venue for the final of the competition. It was hoped that spectators would be allowed into the final but on 28 September, the RFL confirmed that due to new COVID-19 restrictions being announced that the game will be played behind closed doors for the first time in the history of the competition.\nFirst round.\nThe draw for the first round was made at the home of community club Bentley, near Doncaster. Ties were played over the weekend of 11–12 January 2020.\nSecond round.\nThe draw for the 2nd round was made at the studios of BBC Radio Leeds and broadcast live on air. Ties were played over the weekend of 25–26 January 2020.\nThird round.\nThe draw for the third round was made live from Rochdale Hornets Crown Oil Arena. Ties were played on the weekend of the 8–9 February 2020. Several matches scheduled for 9 February were postponed due to the adverse weather caused by Storm Ciara and played the following weekend.\nFourth round.\nThe draw for the fourth round was made live on BBC Sport, live from Halifax's MBI Shay Stadium. Ties were played over the weekend of 21–23 February 2020.\nFifth round.\nThe draw for Round Five was streamed live on BBC Sport and Our League on Monday 24 February at 6.30pm live from Hull Kingston Rovers’ Hull College Craven Park. Rovers were one of four Super League clubs joining the competition at this stage, alongside Huddersfield Giants, Toronto Wolfpack and Wakefield Trinity. Ties were played over the weekend of 14–15 March 2020.\nSixth round.\nThe draw for the sixth round was made live from MediaCityUK in Salford on Monday 16 March 2020, and was streamed live on BBC Sport, and the Our League app from 6:00pm. Originally scheduled to be made in New York, the draw was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDefending champions Warrington were due to start the defence of their title at this stage, along with other Super League teams Castleford, Catalans, Hull FC, Leeds, Salford, St Helens and Wigan. Ties were scheduled to be played over the weekend of 4–5 April 2020, however due to the suspension of all rugby league games as part of the United Kingdom's response to the coronavirus pandemic meant that these dates were speculative and therefore rescheduled for a later date.\nThe fixtures drawn on 16 March were:\nOn 17 July 2020, the RFL announced that the competition would resume on 22 August with a double header at the John Smith's Stadium, Huddersfield involving the Warrington v Wigan and Salford v St Helens with both games shown live on BBC TV. A few days later on 21 July Toronto Wolfpack announced that the club would be taking no further part in the Challenge Cup due to financial problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe RFL had also decided to abandon the Championship and League 1 competitions and following Toronto's withdrawal a meeting was held on 27 July to consider the future of the cup competition. The following day, the five non-Super League teams left in the cup; Featherstone Rovers, Newcastle Thunder, Sheffield Eagles, York City Knights, and Widnes Vikings, all announced that they were withdrawing from the competition. In response to this, the RFL announced that the whole of the sixth round was to be redrawn, involving just the 10 Super League sides remaining in the competition. Four teams would play in the revised sixth round, with the six remaining teams not to receive a tie for this round automatically gaining a bye to the quarter-finals.\nThe redraw for the sixth round and the draw for the quarter-finals was made on 29 July. The two sixth round ties were due to be played as a double header at the John Smith's Stadium, Huddersfield as previously announced, with both ties being televised live on the BBC. During the week of 10 August, a number of Hull players and coaching staff tested positive for COVID-19, so the club's next fixtures, including the sixth round tie against Castleford were postponed. The Castleford v Hull fixture was eventually played on 13 September.\nSemi-finals.\nThe draw for the semi-finals was made on 19 September with both games played at the Totally Wicked Stadium, St Helens as a double-header on 3 October. The draw was made live on BBC Two at the A J Bell stadium during the half-time interval of the last quarter-final match between Hull FC and Wigan."

        "title": "Boston University–Maine men's ice hockey rivalry",
        "text": "The Boston University–Maine men's ice hockey rivalry is a college hockey rivalry between the Boston University Terriers and the Maine Black Bears in the Hockey East conference. The rivalry was born out of fierce on-ice competition between the two schools, especially in the 1990s and early 2000s, as the two schools were routinely at the top of the Hockey East standings and battled each other for conference supremacy.\nHistory.\nIn the early years of Maine's program, the rivalry was one-sided and had not yet truly formed, as Boston University dominated Maine on the ice, defeating them 13 consecutive times between 1982 and 1986, one of the worst losing streaks to a single opponent in Maine's history. Once legendary Black Bears coach Shawn Walsh took over the program, however, the tides started to turn, and Maine began to make up ground. One notable meeting between the teams occurred on February 19, 1993, at Alfond Arena in Orono, home of the Black Bears. Maine was in the midst of an unprecedentedly successful season, having entered that contest with a record of 30-0-2. Midway through the third period, Maine was leading by a score of 6-2, and it appeared they would cruise to another easy victory. However, the Terriers would rally, and manage to score four unanswered third period goals to tie the game at 6-6 and send it to overtime. In the overtime period, Terriers forward Mike Prendergast would get a breakaway from center ice and proceed to score the game-winning goal for the Terriers, giving them a stunning 7-6 victory and handing Maine their first loss of the season. Prendergast would say after the game, \"My sister could have scored that goal\" to taunt the Maine players and fans. However, this would end up as Maine's only loss the entire season, as they would not lose another game all season and win their first national title with a stunning 42-1-2 record, including defeating the Terriers twice more by a combined score of 11-3. Boston University would have their revenge, however, winning a national championship of their own in 1995, defeating Maine in the national title game 6-2. The on-ice rivalry between the schools was often overshadowed by the personal rivalry between the coaches, Walsh for Maine and BU's own legendary coach Jack Parker. Both men were impassioned and bombastic coaches, and as such drew the ire of each other and of opposing fans. While they often had choice words for each other during their coaching careers, Parker spoke kindly of Walsh during his cancer treatment and following his 2001 death. While some fans view Boston College and New Hampshire as BU and Maine's historical and primary rivals, respectively, fans from the heat of the rivalry in the 1990s and early 2000s may report that in their opinion, either Maine or BU is their schools true rival, not UNH or BC. Even after Walsh's 2001 death, the rivalry has remained heated and competitive, meeting in the Hockey East playoff tournament in 2002, 2004, 2009, 2010, and 2012, with Maine winning each matchup aside from 2009. The two teams also met in the NCAA National Tournament in 2002, with Maine emerging victorious. On January 24, 2004, the two teams combined for 268 penalty minutes in one game, a men's college hockey record that stands to this day, and stood as the all-levels, both genders record until 2013. The majority of the penalty minutes were accrued during a brawl at the end of the game, which was a 1-0 victory for Boston University. Even as Maine's team performance has declined in the latter part of the 2010s, games between the teams remain tense, chippy affairs, and simultaneous success for the teams would lead to a rejuvenation of the once-heated rivalry.\nGame Results.\nAs of November 17, 2023 \n† Hockey East Tournament &lt;br&gt;\n†† Hockey East Championship Game &lt;br&gt;\n††† NCAA Tournament &lt;br&gt;\n†††† NCAA National Championship Game"

In 1996, Parsons played in England for Keighley Cougars.\nIn 1997, Parsons played in the Gold Coast's first ever finals campaign. Parsons featured in both matches, the qualifying final victory over the Illawarra Steelers and the semi-final defeat against Eastern Suburbs.\nThe following year in 1998, Parsons played in what was to be the Gold Coast's last season. Parsons played in the Gold Coast's final game as a club which came in round 24 1998 against Cronulla-Sutherland at Carrara Stadium.\nAfter the liquidation of the Gold Coast, Parsons signed for North Sydney. Parsons scored a try for Norths in their final home game at North Sydney Oval in the top grade as they defeated Melbourne 24–20. The following week, Parsons played in what would be North Sydney's final game as a first grade team when they faced off against the North Queensland Cowboys at the Dairy Farmers Stadium in Townsville. Norths would win the match 28–18. Following the conclusion of the 1999 NRL season, Norths controversially merged with rivals Manly-Warringah to form the Northern Eagles as part of the NRL's rationalisation strategy. Parsons was not offered a contract to play with the newly formed team for the 2000 NRL season."

All First Round and Quarterfinal matchups were held at home team venues, while all succeeding games were played at the Herb Brooks Arena in Lake Placid, New York.\nQualifying teams.\nThe following teams qualified for the tournament. Automatic bids were offered to the conference tournament champion of seven different conferences. Four at-large bids were available for the highest-ranked non-automatic qualifiers (overall seed in parentheses).\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured four rounds of play. All rounds were Single-game elimination. The top four overall seeds were arranged so that the first- and fourth-seeded teams would be in the same semifinal bracket while the second- and third-seeded teams would play in the other.\nBecause the third western seed had a higher overall ranking than the second eastern seed the western team was given a bye into quarterfinal round. Because both teams that received byes in one bracket were from the west both were placed in the same quarterfinal bracket to cut down on travel. To further cut down on travel the remaining western team received the final bye and would play the second western seed in the quarterfinals.\nThe top eastern team received a bye into the second round and would play the winner of the match between the fourth- and fifth-seeded eastern teams. For the remaining quarterfinal bracket the second- and seventh-seeded eastern teams would play with the winner advancing to play the victor of the game between the third- and sixth-seeded eastern teams.\nWith the fourth overall seed being placed in the same quarterfinal as the first overall seed, the remaining bracket contained the second eastern seed as the top-ranked team.\nIn the First Round and Quarterfinals the higher-seeded team served as host."

        "title": "1926 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1926 season of the Auckland Rugby League was its 17th.\nPonsonby won the Monteith Shield, the major first grade title after defeating City Rovers in the final. Richmond won their first ever senior trophy when they won the Roope Rooster. On the last week of the season these teams met for the Stormont Shield with Ponsonby winning by 15 points to 5 over. Northcote won the B Division championship, with Kingsland winning the Stallard Cup for taking out the B division knockout competition. The representative season was dominated by a long series of trial matches to assist in selecting the New Zealand team to tour England.\n \n \nAuckland Rugby League News.\nAthletic club name change.\nAt the annual general meeting of the Athletic Rugby League Football Club the idea of adopting the name of Grafton Athletic was discussed though no decision was made at the time it was later agreed to change the club name to Grafton. They were known as 'Maritime' from their formation in 1918 and remained as such for four years until the start of the 1922 season when they changed their name to Athletic. They remained 'Athletic' for four years until deciding to change their name again in this 1926 season to Grafton Athletic. There had previously already been a Grafton Athletic club which formed in 1914 under the leadership of Karl Ifwersen and they survived for seven years until the 1920 season which was their last after Ifwersen switched back to the rugby code.\nSenior competitions.\nNominations were received for 13 teams to compete in the Senior Grade. It was decided to have an A section and a B section like the 1925 season. In the A section competing for the Monteith Shield would be the same 7 teams as the previous year. They were Ponsonby United, City Rovers, Marist Old Boys, Devonport United, Richmond Rovers, Newton Rangers, and Grafton Athletic (previously named 'Maritime' from 1918–21 and then Athletic from 1922–25). The same 5 teams would compete in the B section with the addition of Parnell. The teams in that section were Northcote, Kingsland, Ellerslie, Mangere (not the present day club), Otahuhu, and Parnell.\nJim Parkes who had moved to Auckland and begun playing for Richmond was also to coach the side. With the Monteith Shield competition nearing its later stages L Taylor joined the Richmond club from the Whitiora club in Hamilton. He scored 54 points in just 6 games for Richmond which meant he finished as the second highest scorer for the season behind Maurice Wetherill. During the season the New Zealand team was chosen to tour England and many clubs were hard hit by player losses to the tour. Wetherill was almost a certainty to make the tour but was unavailable to tour. He remained with his City Rovers team who qualified for the final with Ponsonby United but could not lead them to the title.\nCarlaw Park.\nAlbert Asher the well known former New Zealand international was appointed to work on the ground staff at Carlaw Park. He would be busy mid season when torrential rain leading up to the round 5 matches forced their abandonment. A large hole opened up on the number one field due to water overflowing from the railway embankment and the surrounding hills overwhelmed the surface drains. \"As a result, the water forced its way back, emerging from a joint in the main pipe. The ground for some feet around was raised and, when it subsided, an open hole was revealed\". It took several days to repair the playing area which was open again for the following weekend. In December proposed plans for Carlaw Park's redevelopment were released though they were not carried out as shown in the image. The image showed the terraces becoming a large multilevel stand with a terrace type stand where the railway stand was at the time.\nRepresentative program.\nA large number of representative and trial matches were played on Carlaw Park during the course of the season. The New Zealand team was to tour England later in the year and so several trial matches were played including Auckland v South Auckland, North Island v South Island, A v B team matches, a 'probables' v 'possibles' game, Auckland v The Rest of New Zealand, and ultimately after the team had been selected Auckland played them before they departed. Then near the end of the season Auckland defended the Northern Union Challenge Cup 3 times against Otago, Canterbury, and South Auckland (Waikato). The season was then concluded with an Auckland Colts match against the B Division representative side.\nThe Auckland members of the New Zealand team to tour England were:Craddock Dufty (Grafton), Charles Gregory (Marist), George Gardiner (Ponsonby), Jim Parkes (Richmond), Lou Brown (City), Ben Davidson (City), Jack Kirwan (Marist), Hec Brisbane (Marist), Hector Cole (Ponsonby), Stan Webb (Devonport), Frank Delgrosso (Ponsonby), Ernie Herring (Grafton), Arthur Singe (Marist), Bert Avery (Grafton). Avery was to captain the touring side.\nDuring the tour 7 players went on strike due to a large number of issues they had with the management of the tour and upon their return the New Zealand Rugby League administration banned each of them for life. The only Aucklander to be among the strikers banned was Arthur Singe, the Marist Old Boys hooker. He had joined them after switching from rugby in 1921 where he had represented the New Zealand Army team in 1919 on their British and South African tours and Auckland in 8 matches. He played 48 times for Marist, 15 times for Auckland and made 8 appearances for New Zealand before his ban. The ban was eventually lifted by the New Zealand Rugby League in 1962, 26 years after his death in 1936.\nObituary.\nRobert Alexander Bovaird.\nOn December 30, 1925 Robert (Bert) Alexander Bovaird passed away at the age of 34. He was the secretary of the Auckland Rugby League Referees association for the past 3 years and had refereed for several years including at senior level after previously being a player. He was \"a very painstaking and obliging official, and carried out his duties with credit and satisfaction\". He had owned a general store on Great North Road at Morningside and his body was found in the Auckland Domain in the morning after he had died of a self inflicted gun shot wound. The representatives of the Referees Association acted as pall-bearers at the request of relatives. He left behind a wife, Valerie Bovaird (nee. Tattersall), and an 8 year old daughter (Audrey).\nMonteith Shield (first grade championship).\nOn 22 May all A and B division matches were postponed due to poor weather. Carlaw Park also suffered damage when water overflowed from the railway embankment and adjoining hills which proved too much for the surface drains. It caused the ground to subside and a hole to open up which would take some time to repair.\nMonteith Shield standings.\nWith 1 round remaining Ponsonby was on 18 competition points and City were on 20 competition points. City had a bye and Ponsonby were due to play Grafton however owing to the likely outcome of Ponsonby defeating Grafton Athletic (who were last) which would mean the two teams would be tied on points the ARL decided to have Ponsonby and City playoff for the title instead. This was a regular method of deciding the title winners through this era and had happened in 1911, 1914, 1915, 1923, and 1924. Ponsonby won 13–8 and the result is included in the standings.\nMonteith Shield fixtures.\nIn Round 12 new rules were introduced regarding the play the ball, mirroring rules adopted by the New South Wales Rugby League which made the games more open but it was stated in \"The New Zealand Herald\" that \"it is evident the players will need more schooling to make the interpretation of this rule more effective. In the match between Ponsonby and Richmond every advantage was taken of the referee's awkward position, and some very unfair tactics were adopted in securing the ball from the ruck\".\nRound 1.\nIn the match between Ponsonby and Devonport Lyall Stewart went off after 20 minutes with an injury but was able to be replaced, later Julius Laing fractured his ankle while Charles Webb also went off injured during the second half leaving Devonport with just 11 players. Neville St George was also injured during the match and missed several games.\nRound 2.\nHec Brisbane broke his collarbone in Marist's win over Grafton. The Marist team was captained by Jack Kirwan for the first time after long serving captain, Billy Ghent had transferred to the City club.\nRound 3.\nPonsonby's win over Newton in this round was a club milestone, being their 100th first grade win. In their 17th season and 163rd match they became the second club in Auckland to do this after City Rovers achieved the feat 2 seasons earlier.\nRound 4.\nIn the match between Newton Rangers and Richmond Rovers, flying winger Roy Hardgrave was thought to have broken his collarbone and was stretchered from the field. However it was later found that he had just received a kick to the shoulder after trying to stop a Richmond forward rush. Hardgrave was in his third season for Newton and in 1928 he would gain selection to the New Zealand side against England. His performances would gain the attention of the English management and in 1929 he signed with St Helens, going on to play 214 matches for them, scoring 174 tries. He returned to New Zealand briefly in 1934 but then went back to England, signing for York. In 1938 he returned once more and joined the young Mount Albert club, playing 22 games and scoring 19 tries as a 32 year old. In the same round Lou Brown scored 2 tries in City's 15-0 win over Marist. Brown was New Zealand's most prolific try scorer in its formative decades scoring around 300 tries in approximately 400 games in New Zealand, England, and France. \nRound 5.\nLou Brown tore a ligament in his foot in his match with Grafton and missed several matches but recovered in time to gain selection for the New Zealand team to tour England. His brother E Brown was also injured in the match which also saw George Rayner ordered off.\nRound 6.\nFrank Delgrosso left the field with a bad cut over his eye against Marist which required stitches and missed some game. Maurice Wetherill also missed City's match as he was sitting a plumbers exam. City were upset by Devonport.\nRound 7.\nHec Brisbane made return from a broken collarbone for Marist's match with Richmond. Roy Hardgrave of Newton also returned from his shoulder injury suffered in round 4.\nRound 8.\nThe scoring between Ponsonby and Devonport was dominated by New Zealand internationals from the past, present and future. Ivan Littlewood scored for Ponsonby along with Frank Delgrosso who was in the prime of his career. Delgrosso also kicked 2 goals and would go on to score over 700 points for Ponsonby making him one of the most prolific club scorers in Auckland from 1910 to 1950. Tim Peckham was their third try scorer, with Leonard Riley gaining their other try. Riley did not represent New Zealand but his brother Brian Riley did in 1932. For Devonport New Zealand representatives Lyall Stewart, Len Scott, and Jim O'Brien scored tries, with Bert Laing converting 2.\nRound 9.\nJohnson was ordered off early in the match for Grafton against Marist.\nRound 10.\nClarrie Polson, Newton's New Zealand representative was leaving at this point in the season to go and live in Wellington. Eric Grey came out of retirement to play for Ponsonby.

This was their first major trophy.\nSemi-finals.\nWilfred McNeil of the Ponsonby side broke a rib and received treatment at Auckland Hospital before being discharged. While W.

Primarily Otahuhu played their matches there, both the B grade side and their lower grade teams. Auckland Rugby League had the use of the ground until around 1930 with Auckland Rugby using the grounds for a handful of years before it was no longer used by sports teams.\nIn Round 6 Parnell defaulted to Ellerslie with the club secretary saying \"the fact that five men are on the injured list and that others have had to leave town to seek work in the country were the chief factors\".\nStallard Cup knockout competition.\nThis was the second year that the B Division knockout competition had been competed for.\nOther club matches and lower grades.\nLower grade competitions.\nSecond grade.\nDevonport beat City in the final on September 18 by 6 points to 3. Grafton won the knockout final when they beat Point Chevalier. They had defeated Kingsland and Ponsonby in the semi-finals respectively. Marist withdrew after 2 rounds while Newton withdrew after 10 rounds, Otahuhu after 13 rounds, and Mangere after 15. A large number of results were not reported so the standings are incomplete.\nThird grade.\nGrafton Athletic won the championship and had a season record of 19 wins and 1 loss, for 371, against 63 including their 2 knockout games where they defeated United Suburbs in the semi-final and Devonport United in the final. Ellerslie withdrew after 7 rounds. The majority of match scores were not reported in the newspapers so the standings are incomplete.\nThird grade intermediate.\nRichmond had a 10 win, 2 loss record for the season and also won the knockout competition. They scored 127 points and conceded 57. They defeated Devonport in the knockout final after beating Newton 5-0 in the semi-finals. Devonport had beaten Glen Eden 21-4 in the other semi final. United Suburbs withdrew after 2 rounds while Parnell withdrew after 9 rounds. Curiously Glen Eden joined the competition in the 5th round, then Mangere joined in the 9th round, while a Ponsonby side was also listed in the fixtures for the 9th round but no other rounds. Very few results were reported though it was mentioned that Richmond had won 10 matches and lost 2, scoring 127 and conceding 57 though it is unknown if this also included their knockout matches.\nFourth grade.\nParnell won the championship. Richmond won the knockout competition defeating Grafton 6-3 in the final on October 23. Richmond had beaten Parnell in one semi final while Grafton defeated City in the other. Marist withdrew from the competition after 2 rounds, New Lynn after 3 rounds, Newton after 9 rounds, and Otahuhu after 13. A significant number of results were not reported however 13 of Parnell's 14 results were reported. On September 4 in the match between Ellerslie and Richmond the referee ordered the entire Ellerslie team off at halftime due to verbal abuse while they were leading 8-5. The match was awarded to Richmond.\nFifth grade.\nRichmond won the competition and they also won the knockout competition when they defeated Northcote in the final on October 9. Northcote turned their season around after suffering several heavy losses and temporarily withdrawing from the championship before later rejoining and winning some matches. Grafton withdrew after 12 rounds. The majority of results were not reported. On September 11 in the final round the only match played was between Richmond and Devonport with Richmond winning 13-11. It is possible that this match was the final of the championship. All of Devonport's 3 defeats were to Richmond while they easily won their other two reported results (20-2 and 19-0 over Ponsonby and Grafton respectively). \nSixth grade A.\nCity A won the championship. Akarana won the knockout competition.\nSixth grade B.\nRichmond won the 6th grade A championship. Grafton won the knockout competition when they defeated Richmond in the final on August 28 by 8 points to 0. There were several results not reported so the standings are incomplete. The City side joined in the 3rd round which created a 5 team competition and the need for a bye each round.\nSchoolboys competition.\nThe schoolboys competition was a somewhat informal one with teams joining as the weeks went by as such the table is an indication only of how the respective teams went. It began on September 25 when schoolboys from Otahuhu beat schoolboys from Parnell 5 to 3. Grey Lynn fielded a side on October 16 and lost 6-0 to Parnell while on the same day Papatoetoe drew with Otahuhu 6-6 in their first match. Then on October 23 Newmarket fielded a team which lost to Grey Lynn 9-6 while Richmond made their debut with a 16-8 win over Papatoetoe. \nRepresentative season.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nThe first representative fixture of the season was played on 26 June between Auckland and South Auckland. The match was the first trial game for the selection of the New Zealand team to tour England. With the score a lopsided 33–3 at halftime the selectors added five local Auckland players to the South Auckland team to even the match somewhat and it finished 49 to 15 in favour of the hosts.\nWhile not principally an Auckland team playing the trial matches between North Island and South Island, and the A and B match were heavily populated by Auckland players.\nThe team selected to represent New Zealand featured a large number of Auckland players; Craddock Dufty (Grafton), Charles Gregory (Marist), George Gardiner (Ponsonby), Jim Parkes (Richmond), Lou Brown (City), Ben Davidson (City), Jack Kirwan (Marist), Hec Brisbane (Marist), Hector Cole (Ponsonby), Stan Webb (Devonport), Frank Delgrosso (Ponsonby), Ernie Herring (Grafton), Arthur Singe (Marist), and Bert Avery (captain) (Grafton).\nBefore the team departed they played Auckland at Carlaw Park and went down in a high scoring game by 52 points to 32 after fielding a slightly weakened team against a strong Auckland side.\nAuckland v South Auckland.\nDue to the lopsided match where the halftime score was 33–3 Auckland gave several players to the South Auckland team at halftime including Arthur Mansill who kicked 3 goals for the visiting side.\nAuckland v The Rest (of NZ).\nAuckland played a midweek match with a rest of New Zealand side with 4,000 in attendance. \nAuckland v Otago (Northern Union C.C.).\n Future Kiwi Len Scott also debuted for Auckland after coming on to replace the injured Harry Douglas. The newspapers erroneously had Neville St George named at prop but during the match reports said that Douglas (unnamed in starting side) came off injured.\nAuckland representative matches played and scorers.\nThis list only includes the Auckland team games against South Auckland (x2), The Rest (of NZ), New Zealand, Otago, Canterbury, and South Auckland (Waikato)\nAnnual general meetings and club news.\nAuckland Rugby League Juniors On 16 March Auckland Rugby League held its Junior Management Committee annual meeting where it was noted that the number of teams during the 1925 season was 75, with approximately 1,200 registered players. The full Auckland Rugby League annual report stated that in 1925 there were 12 senior teams and 103 junior teams playing in the various competitions, representing an increase of three senior and 28 junior teams. There was a total of 2,364 playing members. It was also noted that the total receipts from club fixtures was £3,136 and the total amount taken at all games was just over £7,000. The executive intended on spending money on improving the dressing accommodation for players at Carlaw Park, and when funds permit constructing a permanent grandstand."

Their ground was at Thornfield. They joined the Central Amateur League in 1946, and were champions in 1947–48, after which they moved to the United Counties League. In 1950 they amalgamated with Rugby Oakfield and from then on the name was shortened to Rugby Town. Thereafter the Oakfield ground was used. For the 1950/1 season they joined the Birmingham Combination, in which they played until 1954 winning the championship that season which was the final season of that competition. They then joined The Birmingham &amp; District League where they played for four seasons. For the 1958/9 season they joined the Southern League where they stayed for the rest of their existence. They were members of the Southern league Premier Division 1962-1966 and 1968/9. They were winners of The Birmingham Senior Cup in 1970/1.\nIn 1973 the owners of Oakfield refused to renew the lease of the ground thus putting the club out of business. The limited company was wound up that autumn.\nOther clubs that have since used the name Rugby Town have no connection with this club."

        "text": "The Bangladesh cricket team toured Sri Lanka in April and May 2021 to play two Test matches. The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship.\nOriginally, a three-Test tour was scheduled to take place in July and August 2020, but it was postponed to October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, the tour was postponed again, after both boards could not agree on the quarantine requirements for the series. In December 2020, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) were considering touring Sri Lanka in April 2021 to play two Test matches. In February 2021, the BCB confirmed that the tour of Sri Lanka would take place in April. On 19 March 2021, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced the dates for the tour.\nThe first Test match finished as a high-scoring draw, after rain wiped out the final session on the fifth day. Sri Lanka won the second Test by 209 runs to win the series 1–0.\nBackground.\nIn May 2020, Nizamuddin Chowdhury, CEO of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), confirmed that they were in discussions with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) with regards to playing the series. Nazmul Hasan, President of the BCB, suggested that their priorities are ICC events, and will wait to see what the ICC and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) does first. However, on 24 June 2020, the tour was postponed due to the pandemic. In July 2020, both cricket boards were looking at the possibility of rescheduling the tour for October 2020. Also in July 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed it was their priority to reschedule the matches, along with the five other World Test Championship series that had been postponed due to the pandemic.\nIn August 2020, both cricket boards were looking to play a combination of Test matches and Twenty20 International (T20I) matches, with a possible start date in October 2020. On 12 August 2020, the BCB confirmed they would travel to Sri Lanka, leaving for the country on 23 September 2020. On 12 September 2020, Sri Lanka Cricket confirmed that the Bangladesh team would need to quarantine for one week on arrival in the country before they can begin to train. The following day, Sri Lanka Cricket increased the quarantine period to 14 days, with the BCB disagreeing to the length of time their players would be quarantine and the lack of preparation time ahead of the first Test match. In response, Sri Lanka Cricket suggested that the quarantine could be split into two phases, with seven days done in Bangladesh, and the remaining seven days done once the team arrives in Sri Lanka.\nOn 19 September 2020, Bangladesh named a preliminary squad of 27 players to begin training ahead of the tour. However, the following day, one player had to isolate after showing COVID-19 symptoms, along with anyone who came into close contact with him. On 28 September 2020, the tour was postponed again as both boards could not decide on quarantine requirements for the series. SLC insisted on a 14-day quarantine following guidelines from the Sri Lanka government, while the BCB insisted on a shorter length.\nIn December 2020, the BCB began talks with Sri Lanka Cricket tour play a short tour in April 2021. Instead of the original three Tests that were scheduled to be played, the revised tour would have two Test matches, with the possibility of some white-ball matches as well. In February 2021, the BCB allowed Shakib Al Hasan to miss the tour, allowing him to take part in the 2021 Indian Premier League, with the BCB confirming that the tour will take place in April. The following month, the BCB announced that the 2020–21 National Cricket League (NCL) tournament would be used as preparation for the Test matches. However, after only two rounds of matches, the NCL was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the curtailment of the tournament, the BCB were still hopeful of touring Sri Lanka. On 12 April 2021, the Bangladesh cricket team arrived in Sri Lanka.\nSquads.\nOn 9 April 2021, the BCB announced a 21-man preliminary squad for the two Test matches. The final 15-man squad for the Test series was confirmed following the two-day inter-squad warm-up match. Sri Lanka also named a preliminary squad, with bowler Dushmantha Chameera opting out of the tour due to taking paternity leave. Lahiru Kumara suffered an injury during the third day of the first Test, and was ruled out of Sri Lanka's squad for the remainder of the series. On 26 April 2021, Lakshan Sandakan and Chamika Karunaratne were named as replacements for Lahiru Kumara and Dilshan Madushanka in Sri Lanaka's squad.\nStatistics.\nMost wickets.\nSri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 2021\nNext Series.\n! scope=col style=\"background:#9cf;\"| Series\n! scope=row style=text-align:center; | Sri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 2021"

Attendees of the arena are expected to wear face coverings at all times, however neither a negative COVID-19 test nor confirmation of vaccine status is required to enter the stadium.\nThe original bidding documents submitted by the Russian Football Union (RFU) listed the Luzhniki Olympic Complex as the proposed venue, following the success of the location as the setting for the 2019 World Cup qualifiers for UEFA; after the Russian bid was successful, it was decided other locations would be considered. From November 2019 until January 2020, through Moscow's \"Active Citizen\" online platform for voting on local issues, Muscovites were invited to vote for where in the city they thought the World Cup stadium should be built. Options included the Luzhniki, Sparrow Hills, VDNKh, Victory Park and Red Square. From ~200,000 votes cast, the majority chose the Luzhniki, with 43% of the share of votes. The Luzhniki was subsequently confirmed as the venue in July 2020.\nConstruction of the temporary structure began on 5 July 2021, at the \"Festival Square\" area of the complex, outside the front of the Luzhniki Stadium; it was reported as complete on 12 August. 2,000 tons of artificial quartz sand was imported to create the playing surface. It was tested by a specialist laboratory in Canada which compared it favourably to the consistency of natural sand found on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The sand features a special coating to ensure it maintains its usual viscosity in the event of rain.\nOrganisation.\nThe following were some of the milestones in the organisation of the tournament (not belonging of other subsections):\nDraw.\nThe draw to split the 16 teams into four groups of four took place on at 14:00 CEST on 8 July 2021 at FIFA headquarters in Zürich, Switzerland. It was conducted by former Portugal captain, Madjer and former captain of the Russia national association football team, Alexey Smertin. It's procedure was as follows:\nThe teams were first divided into four pots of four based upon a ranking created by considering each team's performances at the World Cup over the past five editions (since 2011); the more recent the tournament, the more weight was given to those results. Bonus points were also awarded to the teams which won their confederation's championship during qualifying. Using this ranking, the best performing teams were placed in Pot 1 (plus the hosts), the next best performers were placed in Pot 2 and so on. What was the composition of the pots is shown below:\nThe draw started with Pot 1. As the hosts, RFU were automatically assigned to position A1. As the title holders, Portugal were automatically assigned to position D1. The other teams were then drawn – the first out was placed into Group C and the second, D. The teams from Pot 2 were then drawn – the first out was placed into Group A, second into B and so on. The same was repeated for Pots 3 and 4. The exact positions in the groups the teams were allocated to was determined by the drawing of a lot from an auxiliary pot.\nTeams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group, save for UEFA, for which one group was allowed to contain two members.\nMatch officials.\nFIFA has chosen 24 officials from 24 different countries to referee matches at the World Cup, who were revealed on 19 July 2021. At least one referee will represent each of the six confederations: four from the AFC, three from CAF, five from CONMEBOL, three from CONCACAF, one from the OFC and eight from UEFA.\nUnlike previous World Cups, a \"structured preparation programme\" was used to develop an open list of candidates over two years from which the final 24 were then selected.\nSquads.\nEach team had to name a preliminary squad of between 12 and 18 players. From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 14 players (three of whom must have been goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. Players in the final squad could be replaced by a player from the preliminary squad due to \"serious\" injury or illness up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.\nThe final squad lists were revealed by FIFA on 13 August 2021.\nGroup stage.\nIn the group stage, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time should be played (one period of three minutes) and followed, if necessary, by kicks from the penalty mark to determine the winner. Each team earned three points for a win in regulation time, two points for a win in extra time, one point for a win in a penalty shoot-out, and no points for a defeat. The top two teams of each group advanced to the quarter-finals.\nThe rankings of teams in each group were determined as follows:\nIf two or more teams were equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings were determined as follows:\nThe match schedule was published on the 8 July, following the draw.\nAll times are local, MSK ().\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time should be played (a single period of three minutes) and followed, if necessary, by kicks from the penalty mark to determine the winner.\n25 and 27 August were allocated as rest days.\nAwards.\nAfter the final, FIFA presented individual awards to the three best players of the tournament, three top goalscorers, and to the best goalkeeper. In addition, a collective award was given to the team with the most points in the Fair Play ranking. Following this, the winners' trophy was awarded to RFU's team.\nIndividual awards.\nThe individual awards were all sponsored by Adidas, except for the FIFA Fair Play Award. The Golden, Silver and Bronze Balls were awarded by FIFA's Technical Study Group, which includes former players such as Claude Barrabe, Matteo Marrucci and Pascal Zuberbühler."

A total of 16 teams competed in the knockout phase.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nQualified teams.\nThe knockout phase involves the 16 teams which qualified as winners and runners-up of each of the eight groups in the group stage.\nFormat.\nEach tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, was to be played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs would advance to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then extra time was played. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the winners were decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, which was played as a single match, if the score was level at the end of normal time, extra time was played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score was still level.\n&lt;section begin=Format /&gt;\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\nFor the quarter-finals and semi-finals, teams from the same city were not to be scheduled to play at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control. To avoid such scheduling conflict, if the two teams were drawn to play at home for the same leg, the order of legs of the tie involving the team which were not titleholders of Champions League or Europa League, or the team with the lower domestic ranking in the qualifying season (if neither team were continental title holder) was to be reversed from the original draw.\nOn 17 June 2020, UEFA announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the final stages of the competition would feature a format change: the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final would be played in a single-leg format from 12 to 23 August 2020 at the Estádio da Luz and Estádio José Alvalade in Lisbon, Portugal. The matches were played behind closed doors, through the decisions of the national and local government.\nFollowing the competition restart in August 2020, a maximum of five substitutions were allowed, with a sixth allowed in extra time. However, each team was only given three opportunities to make substitutions, with a fourth opportunity in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time. This followed a proposal from FIFA and approval by IFAB to lessen the impact of fixture congestion.&lt;section end=Format /&gt;\nSchedule.\nThe schedule was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).\nFollowing the first set of round of 16 second leg matches, the competition was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The final, originally scheduled to take place on 30 May 2020, was officially postponed on 23 March 2020.

Due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the second set of second leg matches were postponed by UEFA on 13 March 2020. On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced that the second legs would be played on 7–8 August 2020, with the venue to be decided between the home team's stadium and a neutral stadium in Portugal (at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto and the Estádio D. Afonso Henriques in Guimarães). On 9 July 2020, UEFA announced that the remaining second legs would be held at the venues originally proposed.\nThe first leg of the Atalanta v Valencia tie was retrospectively blamed by local civic and medical authorities for contributing to the extremely high concentration of coronavirus cases in Atalanta's home city of Bergamo. Several fans and players of Valencia also had positive diagnoses after returning from the game. The second leg of the Atlético Madrid v Liverpool tie was similarly blamed for the sharp increase in coronavirus-related deaths in North West England.\nMatches.\n\"Paris Saint-Germain won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Manchester City won 4–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Atalanta won 8–4 on aggregate.\"\n\"Atlético Madrid won 4–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Bayern Munich won 7–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"2–2 on aggregate.

        "title": "1911–12 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1911–12 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team (variously \"North Carolina\", \"Carolina\" or \"Tar Heels\") was the second varsity college basketball team to represent the University of North Carolina. After the first season, it was announced that star player and captain Marvin Ritch was named manager for the upcoming year's team. He assumed scheduling duties and released a tentative schedule in December. Newspaper outlets deemed it to be one of the toughest schedules to be played. However, before the start of the semester and college basketball season, Ritch left the team to work as a secretary for Congressman Edwin Y. Webb.\nNorth Carolina opened the season at home with a five-game home-stand, the first of which came against the Durham Y.M.C.A. The Tar Heels led for majority of the match, only to lose the game in the closing minutes. Carolina then squared off against Elon College and William &amp; Mary, which the Tar Heels won the former handily and played a closer game in the latter. A physically larger Guilford College faced Carolina next. Guilford emerged victorious 35–20 in a game marred by many foul calls. After beating Virginia Christian, North Carolina dropped the next three games. Their loss against Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute (V.P.I.) was attended by over 2,000 people. The team closed the season beating Wake Forest. The Tar Heels established a large lead in the early second half and went scoreless for the game's remainder. The \"Alumni Review\" reported after the V.P.I. game that \"... basketball has come into its own in this state.\"\nRoster and schedule.\nAfter the conclusion of the Tar Heels' inaugural season, the school's Athletic Association announced the previous season's leading scorer Marvin Ritch as team manager, along with teammate William Tillet as his assistant. He assumed the duties of putting together the schedule for the upcoming season. In October, Ritch returned to his home in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he told the newspapers that he felt North Carolina's team would be the best in the state. In mid-December, a tentative schedule was made public that featured 17 games between January 5 and February 29. Writers from the student run newspaper \"The Tar Heel\" commented on the schedule saying it was \"... one of the longest and hardest ever attempted by a North Carolina College.\" The games against the Charlotte Y.M.C.A. and Guilford College were thought to be early tests before the team travels north into Virginia and around Washington D.C. to play the likes of Georgetown, Virginia, and V.P.I., which were all thought to be difficult opponents. Wilmington's \"The Morning Star\" felt the schedule was tough, stating the team would have to \"hustle some.\" In particular, they viewed the three schedule games against Virginia to be the \"big feature\" and the writers expected the attendance and crowd involvement to be similar to the school's match-ups in football and baseball. The final slate of games differed from the tentative schedule and did not feature the three proposed games against Virginia, a second game against V.P.I., and the single games against Georgetown, Catholic University, Davidson, and Roanoke College.\nPrior to the season, Ritch was also unanimously re-elected as captain of the basketball team. On December 18, 1911, \"The Charlotte News\" reported that Ritch again returned to Charlotte and told the press that he \"may not be able to return to 'the Hill' in the spring.\" The writers commented that if he did not, the basketball team would suffer in his absence. Before the season opened on January 5, \"The Evening Post\" confirmed Ritch's absence as they announced his appointment to be the private secretary for North Carolina Representative Edwin Y. Webb in Washington D.C. According to \"The Morning Star\", Ritch leaving led to a \"distinct dismay among the student body.\" Junius Smith was named captain upon Ritch's departure.\n!colspan=6 style=\"background:#4B9CD3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular season\nRegular season.\nOn January 5, Durham's Y.M.C.A. team traveled to Chapel Hill, North Carolina to face the Tar Heel in their season–opening match. The Y.M.C.A. brought a strengthened team that featured a couple players who were members of Trinity College's team the prior year. These additions were thought to have made the team better and quicker. North Carolina remained in front for much of the game; however, in the closing minutes, the Y.M.C.A. rallied to take the lead and won 29–18. One writer commented that the Tar Heels missed Ritch's presence. Chapel Hill's Bynum Gymnasium hosted Elon College four days later, where the Tar Heels beat them 36–5 with a strong performance from captain Junius Smith. The Tar Heels were thought to have played fast and showed improved teamwork relative to their opening game. The Tar Heels faced William &amp; Mary on January 12. The first half featured back-and-forth scoring and visiting team led the Tar Heels 19–15 at the half. William &amp; Mary's Metcalf scored several points from foul shots. Carolina held William &amp; Mary to just three points for the whole second half, while the Tar Heels scored 15 more points to seal the victory. Smith again was said to have played the best for the Heels, while Tillett and Hanes were also thought to have played well. Following the game there was a break in the schedule due to the school's exam schedule from January 15 to 25. \"The Tar Heel\" reflected on the team's performance by stating they did not have great teamwork or a star player, but just needed practice and could develop into a fast and \"good, fighting quint.\"\nGuilford College defeated the Tar Heels 35–20 on January 31. The Guilford players were reportedly heavier than the Carolina starting five, and although the Tar Heels played good defense, their overall teamwork was lacking, and they could not withstand Guilford's \"machine-like force\". The game had \"a great many fouls\", and Guilford's Hoyos took seven foul shots while North Carolina's Smith took eight. Virginia Christian arrived in Chapel Hill for the Tar Heels' next game on February 2. The contest was closely fought for the first half as it closed with a Tar Heel advantage of 3 points, 18–15. The second half was dominated by North Carolina as they scored 25 points to Virginia Christian's 2, bringing the final score to 45–17 in Carolina's favor.\nThe team traveled to Durham for a rematch against their Y.M.C.A. team on February 12. The Y.M.C.A. made more field goals while the Tar Heels made more foul shots, which resulted in a 26–18 victory for Durham. Durham's Holcomb led all scoring and made some long range shots. V.P.I. arrived in Chapel Hill four days later for the next game. The teams played a close game in the first half, where both managed to counter the opposing team's scores frequently. The Tar Heels were led by strong performances from Tillett and Carrington, who helped create a halftime lead of 21–17. As Carolina held the lead early in the second half, Tillett was removed from the game. Tillett's defense proved to be a critical reason for Carolina's success and shortly after his removal, V.P.I. gained the lead. They extended their lead and won 37–28, anchored by the Legge brothers who each scored 5 apiece. \"The Tar Heel\" regarded the game as the \"best played and hardest fought game\" at Bynum all season long. On February 19, a third match against the Durham Y.M.C.A. happened and proved to be close throughout. Carolina led going into halftime 17–16, but the Durham squad managed to gain the lead and win the game 29–28.\nOn February 26, Wake Forest and North Carolina faced off in Raleigh, North Carolina. A crowd of nearly 1,000 filled the auditorium to see the contest. The game featured several fouls on both teams (5 on Carolina and 11 on Wake Forest) and inconsistent performances by both teams. Carolina won the first half of the game 10–6 with multiple baskets from Smith. The Tar Heels continued to score and reached 18 points; however, Wake Forest began to click on offense and scored seven shots in the final ten minutes, sinking one as time expired. Their efforts fell short as the game ended 18-15 in Carolina's favor.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the game against V.P.I., where an estimated 2,000 people attended, the \"Alumni Review\" wrote that \"... basketball has come into its own in this state.\" When the season ended, \"The Tar Heel\" published a column where it discussed the basketball championship of North Carolina. The editors spoke of the parity between the North Carolina based squads and felt that all of them had an equal right to the championship. In September 1912, \"The Tar Heel\" published a column where it commented on the season, blaming the poor performance on the fact the team started practice after Christmas, while most other successful teams started in October."

        "title": "1931 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1931 Auckland Rugby League season was its 23rd.\nThe inaugural Fox Memorial Shield was won by Marist Old Boys who defeated Devonport United 12–5 in the final round to win by 2 competition points over the same side. This was Marists second ever first grade title after previously winning it in 1924. Devonport United were coached by James O'Brien, the former Devonport player and New Zealand international and they went on to win the Roope Rooster competition defeating Ponsonby United in the final. This was their second time winning the Roope Rooster after they won the inaugural title in 1915. They also beat Marist Old Boys to win the Stormont Shield Trophy for the second year in a row. Alongside these feats Devonport also won the inaugural reserve grade competition with a 5–5 draw in the final securing them the 1 competition point they needed to edge out Ponsonby United. Richmond Rovers won the Stallard Cup by winning the reserve grade knockout competition, defeating Newton Rangers reserves in the final 13–5.\nOn the final day of the season Mr. Samuel Harris of the Newton Rangers team had a heart attack while running with the ball in the final of the Seven-A-Side charity tournament. The game was called off with no result given. He had played with Newton for 2 seasons after moving to Auckland from Hikurangi. He was single and 26 years of age at the time.\nEastern Suburbs toured New Zealand at the end of the season and played 5 matches including 3 at Carlaw Park against Devonport, Devonport-Marist combined, and an Auckland Colts side.\n \nSeason News.\nFox Memorial Shield replaces Monteith Shield.\nIt was the first season where the premier senior teams had competed for the Fox Memorial Shield. Prior to 1931 the trophy awarded was the Monteith Shield (1920–1930), and before that the Myers Cup (1910–14) (there were no trophies awarded during WW1 despite the first grade championship being competed for each season). The donor of the Monteith Shield had written to the league asking permission to withdraw the trophy from club competition and that the league play for a new trophy named after Edward Vincent Fox who had passed away the season previous and who had been heavily involved in Auckland Rugby League for a long period of time. The new trophy was being donated by friends of Fox. The trophy was finished and presented to the league in September. It was described thus; \"measuring 27 inches across by 22 inches deep, the base is a handsome sample of polished rimu, with overlay of contrasting pūriri, on which is an ornate centrepiece in oxidised silver depicting an incident of play in the New Zealand v Australia match of 1926\". The donators of the trophy even went to the extent of sending the silver piece to England to have it effectively reproduced.\nThe Auckland City Council Parks Committee designated the following of its grounds to the league code: Auckland Domain (2), Outer Domain (1), Victoria Park, Auckland (1), Walker Road (2), Western Springs Reserve (1), Grey Lynn Park (1), and 1 additional ground at Grey Lynn to alternate between rugby and league.\nFinancial statement and annual report – From childhood to manhood.\nThe annual report to be filed at the annual general meeting showed that the league had a £9,711 5/9 surplus with total assets of £10,534 19/4. As there were smaller crowds in 1930 the gate receipts were £2,282 12/, down from £3,465 10/5 in 1929. The Junior Management Committee reported that the number of juniors registered was 1,930 compared with 984 the previous year, and 63 teams took the field. At the annual general meeting Mr. James Carlaw said that \"this is a very important meeting, as we have now reached our twenty-first birthday, and have developed from childhood to manhood\". Mr. Phelan presented trophies to the various winners from the previous season. At the Devonport annual meeting Mr. A. Ferguson who was a member of the New Zealand Council and who was presiding over the meeting said that the league game in New Zealand needed to follow the Australian model. He stated that they \"demonstrated the value of physical fitness, which was produced by intensive, scientific training\".\nSenior competition restructuring and Carlaw Park gate takings.\nA management committee meeting which also included the special committee setup the previous year to look into the restructuring of the Senior A and Senior B competitions adjusted their original plans. It had been decided at the end of the 1930 season to reduce the Senior A competition from eight teams to six, thus forcing teams into merging with one another. After the meeting this was adjusted to seven teams. The teams would be Devonport, Richmond Rovers, Ellerslie-Otahuhu (which also included the Māngere United club, who could then choose their own name), Marist Old Boys, City, Newton, and Ponsonby United. The Kingsland team which had been removed from the A grade asked for permission to join with the Marist Old Boys. While the Parnell club which has existed since 1921 amalgamated with City Rovers.\nThe B grade (essentially the second division which had run from 1925–1930) was still to be eliminated. The league would encourage B grade players to try out for the reserve grade teams in the A grade clubs.\nIn a major development for the rugby league game in Auckland the special committee recommended that winning teams would be granted 12.5% of the net gate takings each weekend with losing teams sharing a \"trifle less\". The league would also enforce a rule where every Senior A club must field a reserve grade team \"of sufficient calibre to satisfy the management committee\". If they failed to do so they would be vulnerable to being removed from the A grade. The league also reserved the right to set the two lowest teams together at the end of the season against each other in a match and eliminating the losers, or compelling them to improve their standard of play or withdraw from the league.\nEastern Suburbs tour of New Zealand.\n In mid October the Eastern Suburbs club team from Sydney toured New Zealand. They began their tour with a match against Northland in Whangarei before meeting the Auckland championsDevonport at Carlaw Park the very next day. They then travelled to Hamilton where they played South Auckland while also fitting in a trip to see the sights of Rotorua. Eastern Suburbs then travelled back to Auckland where they played against a combined Marist-Devonport team who inflicted the touring sides only defeat with a 14-13 defeat before a crowd of 15,000. Their final match was against and an Auckland Colts side which included several current or future New Zealand internationals, namely Ted Mincham, Len Scott, Dick Smith, Wilf Hassan, Bert Leatherbarrow, and Ed St George before returning home with 4 wins and a loss.\nRule changes.\nAt the Management Committee meeting prior to the start of the season it was decided to adhere to the latest rules, where a team forcing the ball in their own in goal area would take a drop kick from the 25-yard line as opposed from their own try line. There was an adjustment to the weight allowance from the fourth grade down, and sixth grade players should be under 18 and a half on 1 May. At a following Management Committee meeting it was reported that the English Rugby League had advised that at scrum put in's the loose head would be transferred from the defending team to the attacking team.\nOn 15 August a referee was assaulted by a player after a match between the City and Newmarket Fourth Grade teams at Western Springs Stadium. He had ordered off a player from each team. The City player came back on the field and his team refused to remove him so the referee called the match off. He was then harassed by a number of players and one of them then fought with him, \"the pair rolled on the ground fighting for a few minutes, the referee holding his own until some spectators intervened and separated\" them.\nNew clubs at Papakura and Glenora, and several amalgamations.\nOn March 26 the Papakura Rugby League club was formed with 60 players enrolling. They applied to the Papakura Town Board for use of the reserve at Papakura. This was granted as the entire club had switched over from Rugby Union meaning they had no competition for the field. The council said that if a representative rugby game was being played on the field then the league team could use Prince Edward Park (which later became their home ground and remains so to this day). On Saturday, 18 April they played a practice match with Mount Wellington at Papakura. The match was won by Mount Wellington by 8 points to 5. Papakura's points came from an unconverted try to Johnstone, and I. Wilson kicked a penalty goal. They held their first social on the evening of Wednesday 22 April at the Paragon Theatre.\nThe Kingsland Athletic club joined with Marist Old Boys meaning their senior players would join those of Marist. Kingsland were already an amalgamated club involving Kingsland Rovers and Grafton Athletic (originally named Maritime and not to be confused with the Grafton Athletic club which existed from 1914 to 1922). This placed Marist as one of the early favourites to win the Senior Grade. This was discussed in an article on the prospects of all the teams in the New Zealand Herald.\nThe Ellerslie United, Otahuhu Rovers, and Māngere United clubs combined to form a senior team with the Māngere Senior B team being regraded to first junior (2nd grade) with the team playing as part of the Ellerslie-Otahuhu side. However Māngere United then sent a deputation to a Management Committee meeting asking to be able to play as a separate institution as a junior club rather than be a part of the Ellerslie-Otahuhu amalgamation. They wished to be affiliated under their own name rather than amalgamate with Ellerslie. Several speakers from Māngere they said that they wished to play league football but maintain their own identity as a Māori team. The League said that there should be a conference with Ellerslie and in the meantime they would play for one week with Ellerslie. At a league meeting on 27 May the league decided to uphold their earlier ruling and enforce the amalgamation with the decision reviewed at the end of the season. It was expressed that the Māngere players were willing to play as the league suggested. Mr. Jim Rukutai suggested that Māngere be granted permission to retain their identity for twelve months, subject to all transfers being through the Ellerslie-Otahuhu United Club. The chairman of the league said \"he did not think that there was any objection to Māngere playing as the Māngere section of the amalgamated club, but it was the duty of the League to uphold Ellerslie-Otahuhu Club\". In the meantime he thought \"moral suasion should be used by the members and the position would right itself\". At the Management Committee meeting on 10 June it was reported by the chairman that the Māngere and Ellerslie clubs had reached a satisfactory agreement and that \"the Māori senior team,… was willing to continue playing the league code. It was intended that Māngere should apply for the resignation of its players who had already played for Ellerslie\" The matter would be deferred for one week.\nIt was announced at a City Rovers club meeting that the Parnell club had amalgamated with them. They would enter teams in the senior, reserve senior, first junior, third intermediate, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh grades, and also in the primary school competition. Ten of the Parnell senior B players were regraded to first class juniors and would play for that particular City Rovers side.\nIn June a new club was registered in the Glen Eden district and was named Glenora. They entered a team in the third grade intermediate. There was a team in the area named Glen Lynn at the time which was a combination of the New Lynn and Glen Eden sides of the late 1920s, and so to distinguish them Glenora chose that name as some of their players were from the Oratia area, and the name was initially spelled as Glen Ora.\nFox Memorial Shield (1st grade championship).\nThe Senior Grade was reduced from 8 teams to 7 for the 1931 season. Each team had to field a reserve side and their matches were to be played prior to the A team's matches at the same venue.\nFox Memorial fixtures.\nRound 1.\nIn Round 1 Marist won after time however the play was continued erroneously. Time was up but the time keeper allowed additional tackles and did not ring the bell until after the winning try had been scored. Richmond protested the result and after multiple meetings it was eventually decided by the league Management Committee to replay the match.\nRound 2.\nIn the match between Marist and Ponsonby, Heck Lunn (Ponsonby) left the field in the 2nd half with a broken rib.\nRound 3.\nThe Round 3 match between Richmond and Newton was the first ever senior league match played at Western Springs Stadium which had opened for cycling and field sports in 1929.\nRound 1 replay.\nThis match was replayed from Round 1 when the time keeper allowed play to continue well after the bel should have been rung. In the replayed match H Carter for Marist was ordered off for “rough play”. Charles Gregory and Gordon Campbell both of Marist then left the field with injuries leaving Marist to hang on with 10 men for the last few minutes of the game.\nRound 7.\n Marist and Devonport met in a top of the table match with Devonport first with a 5-0 record and Marist second with a 4-1 record. Marist's win saw them draw level. Marist wore white arm bands as a mark of respect to George Drew, a senior player who had been killed by a fall of earth at Waitakaruru 4 days earlier at the age of 28.\nRound 9.\nIn the Richmond – City match both Stan Prentice and Steve Watene were both sent off for fighting.\nRound 12.\nThe Round 12 match at Devonport between the hosts and Ellerslie-Otahuhu was one with paid entry after permission was granted by the Devonport Borough Council. A sum of £12 5/ was raised to assist the Devonport Welfare League's funds. Unofficially the Devonport v Ellerslie-Otahuhu match was referee Les Bull's 100th time officiating an Auckland senior club team match. He was the first referee to achieve this in Auckland Rugby League.\nRound 13.\nThe Round 13 matches were played in terrible conditions which saw the cancellation of almost all league in Auckland. The match between Marist and Ellerslie-Otahuhu played at Papatoetoe was abandoned at halftime due to the north-westerly squalls making playing conditions impossible. The score of 21–3 in favour of Marist was declared the final score. City was severely understrength with 5 of its regular players absent, while in the Ponsonby-Devonport match Lou Hutt of Ponsonby was ordered off near the end of the match.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nSemi finals.\nThe semi finals were postponed initially due to poor weather before being played on 12 September. The match between Ponsonby and Richmond went to extra-time after it was 20–20 at the end of regular time. This was very rare as usually tied games were replayed. Ponsonby went on to win 28–20.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nTop try and point scorers for A Grade, Roope Rooster matches and the Stormont Shield match. Frank Delgrosso of Ponsonby was the top point scorer for the 3rd time in his career with 70 points. He was regularly in the top 5 point scorers in the first grade competitions and to this point in his career had amassed more than any other player, with 665 points. Len Scott (Devonport United) was the top try scorer with 12, closely followed by George Batchelor (Marist Old Boys) and Pat Meehan with 11, and Stan Prentice (Richmond Rovers) with 10.\nSenior reserve grade standings.\nThe standings include the 'final' between Devonport and Ponsonby which was a 5–5 draw. This meant Devonport won the title as they finished the competition with one more point that Ponsonby. A Round 11 result between Marist and City is unknown as it was not reported in the newspapers while the score between Devonport and Ellerslie-Otahuhu in Round 12 is also unknown, though Devonport were the victor.\nSenior reserve grade fixtures.\nThe Round 13 matches at Carlaw Park were cancelled due to the poor weather conditions and the necessity to protect the ground for the Senior matches to follow immediately afterwards.\nCharity day tournament and death of a player (Samuel Harris).\nOn 31 October a Charity Day was held at Carlaw Park. It featured a Seven-A-Side tournament, an 'old timers' match, a match between the referees and St Johns Ambulance, and several running races. The proceeds would all go to the St John Ambulance Brigade. Mr. Samuel Harris of the Newton team collapsed and died from heart failure a few minutes from time in the final. Harris had played for the Newton seniors after joining the club in 1930 and had scored a try in a match earlier in the season. He had played in their earlier matches and had participated in a running race but had complained of feeling too unwell to run again. He collapsed while running with the ball and despite immediate attention from members of St, John Ambulance he died almost immediately. The match was called off. Harris had joined Newton in 1930 and was originally from Hikurangi. His funeral was held in Hikurangi on 4 November.\nOther club matches and lower grades.\nLower grade competitions.\nThe Mid-Week competition which was running once again was made up of nine teams. It was decided to allocate the Monteith Shield to the championship. This had formerly been awarded to the winner of the Senior grade champions, but as of this year the newly presented Fox Memorial Shield would replace it. The Waitemata (Endean) Shield would be awarded to the team scoring the most championship points in the second round, and the \"Nuko\" Cup to the winner of the two lower teams on the ladder. Marist were awarded the Davis Shield for scoring the most competition points in the junior grades.\nSecond grade.\nPoint Chevalier won the second grade championship for the first time. They were closely followed all season by Mount Albert and Papakura. Papakura were the only side with all of their results reported so the for and against and win/loss records are slightly incomplete. Papakura won the knockout competition on September 12 when they beat Mount Albert 26-0 in the final. Mount Albert had defeated Point Chevalier in one semi final while Papakura beat Northcote 8-5 in the other. On July 18 the City side played Huntly and won 5-3 while on August 15 Point Chevalier beat a Riverhead side 11-6 at Hobsonville. On August 22 Papakura played a South Auckland (Waikato) side and won 8-3. Then at the end of the season a second grade representative side played the Wednesday Competition representatives and lost 23-6. The second grade representative side was called 'Auckland Juniors'. On October 17 they also played the Devonport reserve grade side who had won the championship and won 18 to 3. Ponsonby withdrew after 9 rounds having defaulted at least 2 of their matches.\nThird Grade Open standings.\nMarist Old Boys won the championship when they defeated Ponsonby United in the final on August 29 by 4 points to 2. It was Marist's first time winning this grade. Devonport defaulted their first two matches and then withdrew from the competition, while Ellerslie entered a side but withdrew after the first week with it unknown if the match was played or not. Glen Lynn played until round 12 before withdrawing. On May 30 when Marist had their bye they played a Waiterimu, a Waikato side, and won 3-2.\nIn the knockout competition Marist beat Devonport 8-0 in one semi final and Ponsonby beat Glenora 8-3 in the other. Glenora had recently formed and entered a team in the 3rd Grade Intermediate competition but decided to enter a team in the 3rd Grade Open knockout competition. They beat Richmond 3-0 to make the semi-final where they were beaten. Marist and Ponsonby drew 5-5 in the knockout final therefore a replay was needed. Ponsonby won the replay 8-2 on September 26.\nThird Intermediate Grade standings.\nRichmond Rovers won the 3rd grade intermediate championship for the 4th time in their history. It was only in the 6th year of competition. There were a large number of results not reported so the standings are very incomplete. The competition was notable because Glenora fielded their first ever side when they entered a team in round 6 on June 6. They lost the match to Akarana 16-0. In the knockout competition Richmond beat Mount Albert in one semi final while Akarana beat City 10-4 in the other semi final. Richmond then completed the double when they defeated Akarana 6-3 in the final on September 12. Glenora were knocked out in the first round on August 22 by Mount Albert 6-4 and then entered a side in the 3rd grade open knockout competition. Glen Lynn (an amalgamated club between Glen Eden and New Lynn) withdrew after 8 rounds.\nFourth Grade standings.\nMarist won the championship and the knockout competition when they beat Richmond 13-0 on October 10. It was the first time they had won the fourth grade competition in its 20th year of running.\nGlen Lynn entered a team but did not play a game before withdrawing. Ellerslie defaulted their first two matches and then withdrew. Mount Wellington withdrew after 3 rounds despite winning in round one and a default win over Ponsonby in round 3. Ponsonby withdrew after defaulting in the third round while Avondale withdrew after 14 rounds.\nFifth Grade standings.\nMarist won the championship for the fifth grade for the second time with the previous being the year prior in 1930. They also won the knockout competition when they beat City in the final 6-3 on October 3. Marist had beaten Ponsonby in one semi final while City beat Devonport in the other. There were a significant number of scores not reported so the standings are incomplete.\nPapatoetoe and Newmarket both entered teams but neither had a result reported and Newmarket withdrew after round 1 and Papatoetoe after round 2. Mount Albert withdrew after 17 rounds near the end of the championship, with Ellerslie withdrawing a week later.\nSixth Grade standings.\nNewmarket won their first ever sixth grade championship when they defeated Richmond 3-2 in the final on September 26. They had won the schoolboys championship in 1928 and 1929 so may have included some of those players coming through the grades. Ellerslie withdrew after 3 rounds having defaulted their 2nd match and neither of their other results reported. Newmarket also won the knockout competition by the same score over the same opponent on October 17. Newmarket had beaten Marist on one semi final while Richmond beat City 14-6 in the other.\nSeventh Grade standings.\nRichmond Rovers A won the seventh grade championship for the second consecutive year. It had been inaugurated in the 1930 season effectively replacing the Sixth grade B competition. Ellerslie were runners up but they had 5 results not reported, with Richmond A having a significant number of scores not reported either so the standings are incomplete. Richmond A also won the knockout competition when they beat Ellerslie 3-2 on September 12. Ellerslie beat City in one semi final and Richmond beat Point Chevalier in the other.\nPrimary schools standings.\nThere were a large number of results not reported and therefore the standings are significantly incomplete. It is unknown who won the championship. Richmond initially entered a B team as well but they had two fixtures organised but no scores reported before withdrawing.\nOn October 10 a schoolboy \"City Representatives\" side played a \"Suburbs Representative\" side with the City team winning 20 points to 9. Despite their respective team names the players were made up of players from all over Auckland and no specific geographic area. City included Johnston, Bennett, Filmer, Moore (Newmarket), Legge, Robertson, Bell (City), Zaninovitch (Newton), Sime, Moyle (Devonport), Duncan (Papatoetoe), McInnarney, Haynes (Ellerslie), Hall (Avondale), and Bauern (Richmond). The Suburbs team included Franklin, Stanaway (Newmarket), Stenberg, D. Gildard (Avondale), Beer (Ellerslie), Turner, Williams, Korsache (Richmond), Sullivan, McArthur, York (Devonport), Paltridge, Skinner (Northcote), Burgess (Newton), and Mullins (Papatoetoe).\nMid Week Competition standings (Monteith Shield).\nThe league was known as the Mid Week competition and also the Wednesday competition. The championship winners were awarded the Monteith Shield, with the Endean Shield to the team scoring the most championship points in the second round. Waterside Workers won the competition after Stonex and Stormont's defaulted to them in the final round. If they had played and lost then Auckland Locomotives would have had a chance to win the championship. George Gardiner played for the Waterside Workers side. The New Zealand Fertilisers side withdrew after 6 rounds while a Combined Taxis side entered the competition for the second round. No team was allowed to play more than three players who took part in Saturday football though it is unclear if that was only in the senior grades, and no team was allowed to field more than one representative player. On October 14 a combined City Markets and Combined Taxis side played in the knockout final against a Combined Boards and Nicholson Park team but the result was not reported. Two weeks prior they had defeated Auckland Locomotives and Waterside Workers in the semi-finals respectively. \nDuring the season City Markets was thrown out of the competition for fielding an unregistered player but was readmitted after assurances that they would follow the rules in the future. On August 26 the match between Waterside Workers and Stonex and Stormont's was abandoned with minutes to go with the Waterside team leading 8-5. Spectators had encroached on the field at Victoria Park and the referee was unable to clear them and so called the game off with a replay later required. The games attracted large crowds, particularly the ones at Victoria Park which often drew thousands of interested onlookers. The ground was particularly close to the waterfront where most of the Waterside Workers would have been employed. The two bottom teams played off on September 30 for the \"Nuks\" Cup with Ellerslie Town Board Rovers beating Nicholson Park 8 to 3.\nOn October 10 a Midweek representative team played the Taupiri seniors in Taupiri and won 24-12. They also played the Auckland Juniors and won 23 to 6.\nRepresentative season.\nIt was a very quiet year on the representative team front. There was a match played between North Island and South Island, but the Auckland team's only match was against Northland. Auckland junior teams played two matches and a colts side played against the touring Eastern Suburbs team from Sydney who were the recently crowned premiers of the New South Wales Rugby League competition.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nAuckland v Northland.\nIn a surprise result Northland had defeated South Auckland to lift the trophy. Auckland played Northland but the match was not for the Northern Union Shield and so they decided to play several young players including future Kiwi Albert Laing who had not yet even played a first grade match and could only manage a 19 all draw."

        "title": "2022–23 UEFA Nations League",
        "text": "The 2022–23 UEFA Nations League was the third season of the UEFA Nations League, an international association football competition involving the men's national teams of the 55 member associations of UEFA. The competition was held from June to September 2022 (league phase), June 2023 (Nations League Finals), and March 2024 (relegation play-outs).\nFollowing their win in 2021, defending champions France were unable to retain their title in the finals after finishing third in their group.\nSpain won the final against Croatia, 5–4 on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time, for their first UEFA Nations League title.\nFormat.\nThe 55 UEFA national teams were divided into four leagues, with Leagues A, B, and C featuring 16 teams each, divided into four groups of four teams. League D featured seven teams divided into two groups, with one containing four teams and the other containing three. The teams were allocated to leagues based on the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League overall ranking. Each team played six matches within their group, except for one group in League D which played four, using the home-and-away round-robin format in June (four matchdays) and September 2022 (two matchdays).\nIn the top division, League A, teams competed to become the UEFA Nations League champions. The four group winners of League A qualified for the Nations League Finals in June 2023, which was played in a knockout format, consisting of the semi-finals, third place play-off, and final. The semi-final pairings, along with the administrative home teams for the third place play-off and final, were determined using a draw. The host country was selected among the four qualified teams by the UEFA Executive Committee, with the winners of the final crowned as the Nations League champions.\nTeams also competed for promotion and relegation to a higher or lower league. The group winners in Leagues B, C, and D were promoted, while the last-placed teams of each group in Leagues A and B were relegated. As League C had four groups while League D had only two, the League C team that was to be relegated was determined by relegation play-outs in March 2024.\nOriginally, the play-outs would have involved all four of the fourth-placed League C teams, with the two losers being relegated to League D. However, due to the ongoing suspension of Russia from all UEFA competitions, the league allocation for the 2024–25 UEFA Nations League was changed so that only one team would be relegated to League D, ensuring that League C would still consist of 16 teams. Based on the Nations League overall ranking of the fourth-placed teams, the two worst-ranked teams qualified for the play-outs.\nThe tie was played over two legs, with the higher-ranked team hosting the second leg. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs remained in League C, while the loser was relegated to League D. If the aggregate score was level, extra time was played without the away goals rule. If the score remained level after extra time, a penalty shoot-out was used to decide the winner.\nTiebreakers for group ranking.\nIf two or more teams in the same group were equal on points on completion of the league phase, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:\nNotes\nCriteria for league ranking.\nIndividual league rankings were established according to the following criteria:\nTo rank teams in Leagues B and D, which were composed of different sized groups, the results against the fourth-placed teams in these leagues were not taken into account when comparing teams placed first, second and third in their respective groups.\nThe ranking of the top 4 teams in League A was determined by their finish in the Nations League Finals.\nCriteria for overall ranking.\nThe overall UEFA Nations League rankings were established as follows:\nUEFA Euro 2024 qualifying.\nThe 2022–23 UEFA Nations League was linked with UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying, providing teams another chance to qualify for UEFA Euro 2024.\nThe Euro 2024 qualifying group stage took place from March to November 2023, deciding 20 of the 23 teams that advanced to the final tournament to join hosts Germany. The 53 teams were drawn into ten groups after the completion of the UEFA Nations League (seven groups of five teams and three groups of six teams, with the four participants in the 2023 UEFA Nations League Finals guaranteed to be drawn into groups of five teams), with the top two teams in each group qualifying. The draw seeding was based on the overall ranking of the Nations League.\nFollowing the qualifying group stage, the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying play-offs took place in March 2024. The participants of the play-offs were not decided based on results from the qualifying group stage. Instead, twelve teams were selected based on their performance in the 2022–23 Nations League. These teams were divided into three paths, each containing four teams, with one team from each path qualifying for the final tournament. The group winners of Nations Leagues A, B, and C automatically qualified for the play-off path of their league unless they had already qualified for the final tournament via the qualifying group stage. If a group winner had already qualified through the qualifying group stage, they were replaced by the next best-ranked team in the same league. However, if there were not enough non-qualified teams in the same league, then the spot would go first to the best-ranked group winner of League D unless that team had already qualified for the final tournament. The remaining slots were then allocated to the next best team in the Nations League overall ranking, with the restriction that group winners of Leagues B and C could not face teams from a higher league.\nThe three play-off paths each featured two single-legged semi-finals and one single-legged final. In the semi-finals, the best-ranked team hosted the fourth-ranked team, and the second-ranked team hosted the third-ranked team. The host of each final was drawn between the winners of the semi-final pairings. The three play-off path winners joined the 20 teams that already qualified for the final tournament via the group stage.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule of the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League was as follows. Due to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar that took place at the end of the year, the league phase was played in June and September 2022.\nThe fixture list was confirmed by UEFA on 17 December 2021, the day following the draw. The fixture list for groups A4 and B1 were amended due to the postponement of Path A of UEFA qualifying for the World Cup.\nThe relegation play-outs of League C were scheduled on the same dates as the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying play-offs. If one or more of the teams due to participate in the relegation play-outs had also qualified for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying play-offs, the relegation play-outs would have been cancelled and the lowest-ranked team in League C Nations League overall ranking would have been automatically relegated.\nSeeding.\nAll 55 UEFA national teams entered the competition. The teams which finished bottom of their group in Leagues A and B, as well as the losers from the relegation play-outs of League C, from the 2020–21 season moved down a league, while the group winners of Leagues B, C, and D moved up. The remaining teams stayed in their respective leagues.\nIn the 2022–23 access list, UEFA ranked teams based on the 2020–21 Nations League overall ranking, with a slight modification: teams that were relegated in the previous season were ranked immediately below those who were promoted. The seeding pots for the league phase were based on the access list ranking. The seeding pots, draw procedure, and fixture list procedures were confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Chișinău, Moldova, on 22 September 2021.\nThe draw for the league phase took place at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, on 16 December 2021, 18:00 CET. The draw, originally planned to take place in Montreux, was held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs the league phase would be played in June and September 2022, no winter venue restrictions were applied in the draw. For political reasons, Russia and Ukraine (due to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine) could not be drawn into the same group. Due to restrictions of excessive travel, any group could contain a maximum of one of the following pairs: Andorra and Kazakhstan, Malta and Kazakhstan, Northern Ireland and Kazakhstan, Gibraltar and Azerbaijan, Armenia and Iceland, Israel and Iceland.\nOverall ranking.\nThe results of each team were used to calculate the overall ranking of the competition, which was used for seeding in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying group stage draw.\nEuro 2024 qualifying play-offs.\nTeams who were unsuccessful in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying group stage could still qualify for the final tournament via the play-offs. Leagues A, B, and C in the UEFA Nations League were each allocated one of the three remaining UEFA Euro 2024 places. Four teams who did not already qualify for the European Championship finals competed in the play-offs for each of those leagues, with the matches taking place in March 2024."

        "title": "Prague Castle skeleton",
        "text": "The Prague Castle skeleton (given the identification number IIIN199) is a human skeleton that was discovered in 1928 at Prague Castle in the Czech Republic. The burial was excavated by Ukrainian-born archaeologist Ivan Borkovský as part of a Czech National Museum project. The skeleton was dated to the 9th or 10th century AD and was associated with high-value burial goods. Ethnic identification of the deceased has proved controversial. \nDuring the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in the Second World War, Borkovský was forced to withdraw a book he had published identifying early Slavic influence in the region. He was also forced to publish a journal article identifying the burial as Germanic or Nordic, to support a Nazi claim of early German involvement in the region. After the end of the war and with Prague under Soviet occupation Borkovský published a paper retracting his earlier work and identifying IIIN199 as a nobleman of the Přemyslid dynasty. The skeleton was kept in storage until 2004 and, though it has been tested extensively since then, a definitive identification has not been possible.\nDiscovery.\nThe skeleton was discovered in the third courtyard of Prague Castle on 11 July 1928 by Ukrainian-born archaeologist Ivan Borkovský, who was leading a National Museum excavation project. The project was investigating a burial ground thought to be associated with an early hill fort on the site of Prague Castle (and dating to AD 800–1000). It was a continuation of work begun in 1925 by Karel Guth, the head of the National Museum's archaeological department, that sought to identify archaeology associated with Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia. Borkovský did not initially write a paper on the discovery of the skeleton as he was of insufficient academic rank, being only an assistant to the head of archaeology at the museum. Guth himself tended to publish papers a long time after excavation, and these often contained little detail. Borkovský was more prominent by the 1930s but was keen to keep a low profile on the potentially controversial matter of ethnic identification of the burial as he was seeking to obtain Czechoslovak nationality.\nThe body belonged to a male; he was likely buried around AD 800–1000 and was given the identification number IIIN199. It was found just below the courtyard surface and was in a wooden chamber measuring by , which was probably originally covered by a burial mound. The courtyard was constructed as part of a rebuilding of the castle in the late 11th century, and the graveyard was partially levelled to accommodate it. However, the integrity of graves seems to have been respected, and the courtyard's slabs successfully protected IIIN199 until the 20th-century. \nIIIN199 was found to be exceptionally tall for the period, some in height, with robust bones that suggested a muscular build. The skeleton was buried lying on his back with his head angled to the left. The skeleton's right hand was found to be resting on the handle of a metre-long iron sword, which was the only sword to be found in all 1,500 early medieval graves excavated at the castle. Two knives were located near the body's left hand, and at the right elbow an object was found that could have been either a razor or a fire steel, which would have been an important status symbol. At the skeleton's feet were a small wooden bucket (often used by Vikings as ceremonial drinking vessels) and an iron axe head. Near the pelvis were found remains of a leather bag that held a small, decorated flint.\nHistorical identification.\nCzechoslovakia was invaded by Germany in 1939. The occupying German forces were keen to provide proof of Germanic heritage in the region. They accused Borkovský of not publishing the discovery of the skeleton as they claimed it was of a German or Nordic man, not of a Slav. They forced him, under threat of being sent to a concentration camp, to withdraw a book he published that identified pottery remains he had found as the oldest Slavic pottery in Europe. The Nazis destroyed most copies of the book. When Borkovský did eventually publish the finding of the remains, his paper supported the \"Nazi-influenced Nordic interpretation\". The paper's original title was \"A warrior grave from Prague Castle\", but it was amended before publication to \"A Viking grave from Prague Castle\" by Lothar Zotz, the German historian who edited the \"Altböhmen und Altmähren\" journal. The paper linked the trefoil decoration on the fire steel to similar designs on German axes and the sword to one found in German Silesia.\nCzechoslovakia was occupied by the Soviet Union at the end of the war. Borkovský narrowly escaped being sent to a Soviet gulag as he was accused of collaboration with the Nazis. After explaining he had been forced to write the pro-Nazi paper, he published a second article on the skeleton in 1946 that identified the subject as a noble of the early Přemyslid dynasty. This identification of the skeleton had been earlier expounded by Borkovský's superior at the National Museum. Borkovský's 1946 paper identified IIIN199 as an 860s AD burial, predating Christian influence in the area.\nReassessment of the identification of IIIN199 was not possible during the Cold War due to the political ramifications, though anthropologist Emanuel Vlček published a paper in the 1970s that claimed the burial must be later in the 9th century and not related to the Přemyslids.\nModern assessment.\nThe remains and grave goods were kept in storage and away from public view until 2004. A modern study of the remains identified the fire striker as a common piece of Viking equipment. Indeed, the majority of the skeleton's possessions have been identified as resembling Viking equipment. The sword has been identified as a high-quality item almost certainly crafted in Western Europe. It is of a type used by the Vikings in northern, western and central Europe. The knives and bucket have been identified as being manufactured near Prague.\nThe cause of death has not been determined, but the man is thought to have died at around age 50. Analysis of the Strontium isotopes in the skeleton's teeth has shown that he grew up in Northern Europe, likely on the southern Baltic coast or in Denmark. This area was home to the Vikings, Slavs and Baltic tribes.\nJan Frolik of the Czech Academy of Sciences has suggested that the individual came to Prague as a young man to serve the early dukes of Bohemia (either Bořivoj I or Spytihněv I). These dukes founded the Přemyslid dynasty from their seat at Prague Castle.\nDue to the complex national identities of early-Medieval Europe, it is possible that the individual regarded himself as a Viking, a Slav or both. This is reflected by the mixed origin of his possessions. Due to his high-status grave goods and prominent burial location, the man likely held a position of prominence in the castle. The University of Helsinki is working on DNA analysis of the skeleton that may help to provide more information on his ethnicity. The amount of modern testing carried out on IIIN199 has been described as second only to the remains of Ötzi the Iceman.\nThe conflicting assessments of IIIN199 have been described as reflecting \"the fate of Czechoslovakia and Central Europe, as the burial became entangled with Czech identity, Nazi occupation and the manipulation of archaeology\"."

        "title": "1912–13 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1912–13 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team (variously \"North Carolina\", \"Carolina\" or \"Tar Heels\") was the third varsity college basketball team to represent the University of North Carolina. In September, Lenoir Chambers was announced team captain. North Carolina, along with several other schools from the state, met in Raleigh, North Carolina and formed the North Carolina Intercollegiate Basketball Association that would establish a state championship where each school in the league would play two games against all other members and the team with the best record was the champion. However, the league did not come to fruition partially because Trinity College's professors did not want to have athletic contests with North Carolina. Student–run newspaper \"The Tar Heel\" published several pieces where they stated the prior season's poor performance was because the team did not start practicing until after Christmas. Try-outs started in early December, but over time participating students dwindled and scrimmaging became difficult, which prompted Chambers to publish in ad in the student newspaper asking for taller players to come by regardless of their experience.\nIn January, after exams, the season opened with a four–game home stand. Following an opening one–point loss to the Durham Y.M.C.A., the Tar Heels won back–to–back games by large margins against Davidson College and Elon College. With Redmon out due to an ankle injury, the team faced Emory and Henry College and lost 20–17. The Tar Heels played their next three games on the road, two of which took place at the Raleigh Auditorium, and lost all three games. In one of those losses, the Tar Heels took Wake Forest to overtime, but were outscored 2–1 and lost the match. Carolina snapped their four-game losing streak against Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute (V.P.I.) in a game where Carolina won handily 29–9. The Tar Heels dropped their next two against Guilford College, who was regarded as the state's premier team that season, and a rematch against Elon where \"The Tar Heel\" commented the team played its \"weakest game.\" Carolina ended their season with a rematch against Wake Forest where the Tar Heels led for the entire game and won 19–15.\nPre-season.\nIn late September 1912, it was announced that guard Lenoir Chambers was voted to be team captain for the upcoming season. In addition, it was announced baskets would be placed that week on outside tennis courts and hopefully practice would begin in the fall. However, the goals had not been placed by mid–October. In early November, \"The Tar Heel\" published a column where it credited the team's poor performance the previous year due to starting practice after Christmas, stating successful programs practiced in October. The writer commented that at this point captain Chambers had the players \"report\" and the team managers had not organized a try–out. The writer further mentioned that several students had been playing on the outdoor courts that were set–up and would provide good opportunities to find new members as well as good competition. On Monday December 2 at 8 PM local time, the try–outs started. Several men showed up including returning players Tillett, Carrington, and Smith returned from the previous year, along with Meb Long who played two years ago. At this point, the schedule was rumored to feature 18 to 20 games, including six at home and a road trip into Virginia for several contests against the likes of Randolph–Macon College, University of Virginia, Washington and Lee University, and more.\nIn early January, another schedule was released with eleven games, but there were hopes to add home contests against NC A&amp;M and Wake Forest. Of the scheduled games listed, a home game against Guilford on March 8 was not played. A home game was scheduled against Wake Forest on March 4, while the NC A&amp;M home game did not materialize. Practice resumed following Christmas break and Chambers led practices each night while coach Nathaniel Cartmell was on temporary leave. The team was thought to have enough tall players and often the team had at most fifteen men, which made scrimmaging difficult. The first game was to happen after exams were finished. \"The Tar Heel\" stated the returning players would help the team be stronger than the previous year. With regards to the new players, it was noted that Ransom was \"scrappier than ever.\" Guard Redman was thought to replace Erwin's void from the year prior. Chambers published an ad in the January 10, 1913 edition of \"The Tar Heel\" where he opened saying \"We need more men out for the basketball team and we need them badly.\" Chambers cited a tough schedule and the need for more than just the roughly fifteen candidates for the team to improve and beat Virginia, NC A&amp;M, and Wake Forest. Chambers requested \"Tall men of the football type\" and encouraged those without experience to try out.\nState–wide basketball league.\nIn late October, it was announced that Carolina, along with other in–state schools including Elon College, Guilford College, North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (NC A&amp;M), Trinity College, and Wake Forest, formed a basketball association, the North Carolina Intercollegiate Basketball Association. Representatives from each school met in Raleigh, North Carolina's Yarborough Hotel where they elected officers including North Carolina's manager R. O. Hufmann, who became president. Eligibility rules were agreed upon—which were stricter due to Trinity's concurrent membership of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association—and it was decided that no player would be allowed to participate if they had been in college for longer than four years or participated in any professional sporting events or teams. The scheduling of basketball games was the primary topic covered at the first meeting as it was hoped that each team in attendance would play two games against each other team represented at the meeting. The state championship would then be awarded to the team that had the best record against the conference members, but if a tie happened there would be a series of games in Raleigh's city auditorium. Huffman officially scheduled a game with NC A&amp;M for February 22 in Raleigh, with hopes for a home game during the season. More rules and organization related topics were to be decided upon at later meetings. This was viewed as a positive development because students at North Carolina had been hoping to have competitive engagements with NC A&amp;M and Trinity in basketball and football.\nIn mid–December, it was reported that the North Carolina Intercollegiate Basketball Association had fallen through, in part, because Trinity faculty did not wish to have any athletic contests with North Carolina, while the students did. A reporter wrote that a rivalry between Trinity and North Carolina would \"probably outstrip anything that has ever been seen in this state in any kind of athletics.\"\nRoster and schedule.\n!colspan=6 style=\"background:#4B9CD3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular season\nRegular season.\nNorth Carolina opened their season with a home game against the Durham Y.M.C.A. After teams traded baskets in the first half, Durham led by a single point going into the half, 11–10. The Tar Heels opened the second half scoring six points unanswered before a scoreless period. Durham managed to score eight points to Carolina's three, to retake the lead. Carolina's Redman then made a basket to take the lead. In the closing seconds, following a jump ball, Durham made a basket and time expired shortly after, giving Durham the win 23–22. Carolina was thought to have had poor teamwork and \"weak\" passing, while missing ten of sixteen free throw attempts hurt the team as well. \"The Tar Heel\" commented that the crowd for the game was \"rude\" and \"semi–civilized,\" expressing desire to show visiting teams more respect in the future. Davidson College came next to Chapel Hill for a game on February 3. North Carolina shut out Davidson in the first half as they scored 16 points. The Tar Heels were led by Long and Carrington, who made the majority of the scores on their way to a 42–8 victory. Two days later, North Carolina faced Elon in a fast-paced match. The Tar Heels outscored the visitors by double digits each half on their way to a 41–11 win.\nEmory and Henry College entered Chapel Hill two days later to face a Carolina team missing Redmon, who was absent due to an ankle injury. Emory scored quickly and then due to \"wild and erratic\" play, no team scored for a couple minutes until Homewood leveled the score. The teams improved their play and each scored a couple times before Emory took control and went into halftime with a 11–6 lead. Emory continued shooting well in the second half and increased their advantage. Carolina closed the score, but time expired and Emory won 20–17. Twelve hundred spectators packed the Raleigh Auditorium to see North Carolina take on Virginia. Virginia's offense in the first half was dribbling heavy and allowed them to get an early 8–3 lead, while North Carolina rallied with long shots to level the score at 13 for the half. Carolina's Redmon was disqualified for \"rough playing\" and the crowd yelled furiously at the referee, which stalled the game ten minutes. Homewood replaced Redmon for Carolina, but without Redmon – who had been playing great defense on Virginia's best player – Carolina fouled Virginia several times and their forward Gill converted several attempts. Virginia closed the game out to win 30–19. After the game, \"The Tar Heel\" wrote that the team played its best ball of the season in the first half.\nThe Tar Heels went on the road and faced Wake Forest in what \"The Tar Heel\" referred to as a \"fine exhibition\" where both teams played \"hard and rough.\" The Baptists led entering the half at 14–8. In the second half, North Carolina made a comeback primarily through foul shots, of which Long made 9 of 12 for the game. The second half expired with the teams level at 20, which meant the teams would play a five-minute overtime period. Wake Forest's Holding made one shot in the period, while Carolina's Long made a foul shot. Holding carried Wake Forest to the win behind 20 points. In advance of the matchup against NC A&amp;M, Carolina students who had season tickets were announced to have gotten free admission to the game in Raleigh on February 22. This likely contributed to what was reported as the largest crowd to attend a basketball game in North Carolina at 2,500 people. This was the first contest between the schools, aside from track meets, in seven years. The teams played slowly and each played tight defense in the first half, which resulted in a 9–6 score in favor of NC A&amp;M. Each team's play intensified in the second half and several shots were made from long distance. The Farmers' Sumner made a long shot with a backwards throw over his head en route to a 26–18 victory.\nThree days later, back in Chapel Hill, V.P.I. and North Carolina squared off and went scoreless for the first five minutes, before Carolina's Long made a foul shot. Carolina then scored nine more points while shutting out V.P.I. V.P.I. managed to only score five points in the first half and four in the second, unable to counter the Tar Heels' offense, the final score was 29–9 in favor of Carolina. \"The Tar Heel\" praised the North Carolina squad's teamwork in the game. Guilford, regarded as the best team in the state, were led by forward Benbow who proceeded to score 32 of the team's 44 points as they beat the Tar Heels. Carolina's next game was a rematch against Elon on March 1. Carolina won the first half 12–9, but Elon overcame that deficit and took the lead and won the game behind a great performance from Johnson. \"The Tar Heel\" wrote that this was Carolina's \"weakest game of the season.\" The final game of the season was a rematch against Wake Forest. Carolina led the whole game and won the game 19–15. Carrington was the game's leading scorer with three field goals."

A simple try is worth one point, a diving try is worth two. The playing season is May to August, between rice-harvest and planting.\nThe game was invented by Nobuyuki Nagate in Fukuchiyama, near the Inland Sea northwest of Kyoto, in 2015, after a typhoon had flooded local rice farms, and many of the first players were farm-women. From Fukuchiyama it spread to neighboring communities, and within a few years Japan's local and national rugby teams joined in, winning about half of their matches.

        "text": "The 1989–90 Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey team represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison in college ice hockey. In its eighth year under head coach Jeff Sauer, the team compiled a 36–9–1 record. The Badgers won the 1990 national championship, their fifth national title.\nSeason.\nFast start.\nWisconsin fielded an experienced team for the 1989–90 season. Led by team captain Steve Rohlik and fellow seniors Chris Tancill, Gary Shuchuk and John Byce, The Badgers got off to a quick start. After having to come from behind to win their first two games, Wisconsin put an exclamation point on their third win (8–2 over Michigan Tech). In a pattern that would follow throughout the season, the eight Badgers goals came from seven different players, illustrating the depth of their offense. Wisconsin suffered its first loss in early November at the hands of Minnesota which began a cycle of split weekends against WCHA teams.\nUp and down play.\nIn five consecutive weekends against conference opponents Wisconsin ended with a .500 record. They did this against both the good (North Dakota, Northern Michigan) and bad (Colorado College, Minnesota–Duluth) and lost the lead their fast start had provided them. During the stretch starting goaltender Duane Derksen hadn't played particularly well and was replaced after surrendering 11 goals to Northern Michigan. Freshman backup Jon Michelizzi, who had won his first two starts against weak, non-conference teams, backstopped the Badgers when they salvaged the weekend against the Wildcats but, after Michelizzi allowed 9 to dreadful Duluth the following weekend, Derksen was back between the pipes. Derksen remained the starter for the remainder of the season with Michelizzi only playing against weak teams or in cleanup duty.\nBadger showdown.\nWhen Wisconsin hit the winter break they had slipped back to the pack and were in a tie with Minnesota for the conference lead. The Badgers attempted to get back on track with their holiday tournament, defeating Notre Dame and eventual Hockey East champion Boston College convincingly but once their conference schedule restarted they continued to split weekends. To make matters worse they lost to St. Cloud State, a team that been in Division III three years prior, between the weekend series and last back-to-back games for the first time all season.\nStrong finish.\nAfter the second loss to Northern Michigan, Wisconsin started the rematch with a vengeance, scoring 5 times in the first period en route to a 10–1 victory. The shellacking by the Badgers kicked off a run of 9 straight victories for Wisconsin (though they were mostly against the dregs of the conference) and ended on the penultimate weekend of the regular season. After splitting their second weekend against Minnesota, Wisconsin sat just 2 points ahead of the Golden Gophers and 4 above North Dakota who they hosted in the final weekend. A tie in the first game eliminated the Fighting Sioux from contention, but with the Gophers winning their first game Wisconsin's lead was down to just one point. With both teams watching the scoreboard, Wisconsin won their game in overtime while Minnesota was soundly beaten 3–8. The win sealed only the second MacNaughton Cup for the Badgers and first since 1977.\nWCHA tournament.\nWisconsin opened the conference tournament against Michigan Tech and gout a tougher fight than they were expecting from the bottom-feeders. After Wisconsin won the first game MTU built a 3–0 lead in the rematch and just as it looked like the series was heading for a third game the Badgers rallied with three of their own in the final 24 minutes and potted the game-winner in overtime. While the Badgers may have been able to get away with taking the Huskies lightly, once the tournament shifted to Saint Paul they couldn't dismiss defending conference champion Northern Michigan as easily. After scoring the first goal Wisconsin had to watch the Wildcats get the next three. Wisconsin once again rallied to tie the game at 3-all and head into overtime with a championship berth in the balance. For the second consecutive game the Badgers netted an overtime goal, bring their extra-session record up to 5–0–1 for the season.\nAfter two nail-biting games, Wisconsin gave their fans a break in the championship, scoring the first four goals and ultimately defeating Minnesota 7–1. Wisconsin's sixth conference championship (2nd Broadmoor Trophy) earned them the WCHA's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, their third consecutive appearance.\nNCAA tournament.\nWisconsin received the 2nd western seed, earning themselves a bye into the quarterfinals and home ice for their series. After a week off the Badgers welcomed Maine to Madison with a 7–3 win in their first game. Wisconsin scored the first five goals of the game and ended the match before the Black Bears could get their skates under them. The rematch the following night followed a familiar pattern; after scoring first Wisconsin saw Maine score three consecutive power play goals and led 3–1 just past the midway point of the game. The Badgers scratched and clawed their way back to a tie in the third period and were very careful not to take anymore penalties against the dangerous Black Bears. Tom Sagissor scored the overtime goal in the fifth minute of overtime to send Maine packing and give Wisconsin a ticket to the Frozen Four.\nIn Detroit the Badgers faced down the top eastern seed, Boston College. In what was probably Derksen's best performance of the season, Wisconsin held BC to a single goal in the game, allowing Chris Tancill's two power play goals to stand up and send the Badgers to the title game with a 2–1 win.\nChampionship.\nIn the final, Wisconsin faced a surprising Colgate squad who had ridden the strong play of goaltender Dave Gagnon to 31 wins entering the championship. Wisconsin hoped their offense would provide them with the edge but the Badgers had a built-in advantage over the Red Raiders; Wisconsin routinely played games in front of large crowds. When the game started 15,000 spectators, more than half of whom wore Wisconsin colors, began cheering. Colgate, a team from a small upstate New York school whose total enrollment could have fit inside Wisconsin's home arena more than twice over, got lost in the lights. The Raiders took a penalty almost immediately after puck drop and John Byce scored at the 90-second mark. When Colgate got the opportunity to tie the game with their own power play a short time later Wisconsin stole the puck in their own zone and Rob Mendel sent the puck to a streaking Byce who skated in on Gagnon and slipped the puck between his pads for his second goal of the game.\nColgate, who was not built for high-scoring games, had to fight furiously to recover after the disastrous start. They were able to cut the lead in half before the five-minute mark but in their zeal to tie the game they took several bad penalties and the WCHA's best power play made them pay; Wisconsin scored twice more in the first on the man-advantage and built a seemingly insurmountable lead for the low-scoring Red Raiders. All the power play time harmed Colgate, in addition to goals, by keeping them away from the Wisconsin net and not allowing them to generate any kind of pressure on Derksen. Colgate could only manage 5 shots in each of the first two periods but was able to score twice. A fourth power play goal by Badgers in the second period all but ended the game and as the third progressed Wisconsin knew they were going to win the national title. Even after Colgate's third goal there was little hope for the underdogs and Jeff Sauer was confident enough to give Michelizzi a turn in net once Byce finished off his hat-trick with an empty-net goal.\nAwards and honors.\nWhile Byce's three goal game in the championship was impressive it was Chris Tancill who received the Tournament MOP. Wisconsin's dominating performance in the championship was typified by having 5 players find their way on the All-Tournament Team; Tancill was joined by Duane Derksen, Rob Andringa, Mark Osiecki and John Byce. The Badgers had three players finish in the top 10 in scoring in the nation but only Gary Shuchuk made the All-American West Team. Shuchuk was also named the WCHA Most Valuable Player and named to the All-WCHA First Team. while Derksen, Byce and Sean Hill made the second team.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The \"Continental\" name was chosen over \"Central States Basketball League\" so that it would be more inviting to potential teams outside of Illinois and Wisconsin, where the football league was based. The CBA played using National Basketball Association rules, which included a 24-second shot clock. Each team played a 20-game schedule, divided into 10 home games and 10 away.\nThe six inaugural teams in 1969–70 were located in Illinois (Decatur, Peoria, Rockford and Waukegan), Michigan (Grand Rapids) and Wisconsin (Waukesha). The Waukesha team began the season based in Cudahy, Wisconsin, but moved mid-season due to lack of fan support. Though they were on top of the league's standings, the Medalist Mods were second to last in attendance. Waukesha went on to win the league title that season.\nDuring the 1970–71 season, the NBA Milwaukee Bucks entered a player-development agreement with the CBA Milwaukee Muskies. The Bucks ended the relationship the following season and the Muskies folded as a result. The Chicagoland Travelers (originally named the Northwest Chicagoland Travelers) also folded after the 1970–71 season because they failed to come up with the $20,000–$30,000 in annual operating costs.\nThe CBA folded after its 1973–74 season."

He played college football at Florida and was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars ninth overall in the 2020 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nHenderson was born and grew up in Miami, Florida, and attended Christopher Columbus High School. He played both running back and cornerback for the Explorers' football team and was invited to play in the All-America Bowl as a senior. He was ranked a four-star prospect and initially committed to play at the University of Miami before de-committing to evaluate other offers. Henderson ultimately signed a letter of intent to play at the University of Florida.\nCollege career.\nAs a true freshman, Henderson appeared in 11 games for the Gators with five starts and made 22 tackles with four interceptions. He became the first freshman in Florida's history to return an interception for a touchdown in back-to-back games after doing so in his first two career games against Michigan and Tennessee. In his sophomore year, his first full season as a starter, Henderson recorded 38 tackles, two sacks and two forced fumbles with two interceptions and a team-high seven passes defended and was named second-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) by the league's coaches.\nHenderson entered his junior season as a preseason first-team All-SEC selection, third-team preseason All-America, and on the Bednarik Award watchlist. Henderson was also named a second-team midseason All-American by the Associated Press despite missing four games due to injury. Henderson finished his junior season with 33 tackles (three for loss), a sack and 11 passes broken up in nine games and was named first-team All-SEC by the league's coaches and a second-team All-American by the Football Writers Association of America. Following the end of the Gators' regular season, Henderson announced that he would forgo his final year of eligibility to enter the 2020 NFL Draft and also skip Florida's bowl game. Henderson finished his collegiate career with 93 tackles, 26 passes broken up and six interceptions in 33 games played.\nProfessional career.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nHenderson was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first round with the ninth overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.

Henderson made his NFL debut in the season opener on September 13, 2020, against the Indianapolis Colts, starting and recording five tackles and his first career interception, picking off a pass from Philip Rivers and returning it for 22 yards, and defending three passes, including breaking up a pass on a fourth down late in the fourth quarter to secure a Jaguars' 27–20 win, and was named the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week.\nIn Week 10 against the Green Bay Packers, Henderson forced a fumble on wide receiver Davante Adams which was recovered by teammate Myles Jack during the 24–20 loss. He was placed on injured reserve on November 19, 2020, with a groin injury. \nIn October 2020 during a ribbon cutting ceremony, the training center at Christopher Columbus High School, his alma mater, was dedicated in the Henderson Family name due to his generous contribution to the redesign of the facility.\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn September 27, 2021, Henderson was traded to the Carolina Panthers with a 2022 fifth-round pick in exchange for tight end Dan Arnold and a 2022 third-round pick.

        "text": "The England women's cricket team played the Pakistan women's cricket team in Malaysia in December 2019. The tour consisted of three Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs), which formed part of the 2017–20 ICC Women's Championship, and three Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is). All of the matches were played at the Kinrara Oval in Kuala Lumpur. Pakistan have played England eight times previously in WODI matches, without recording a win. In WT20Is, the teams have faced each other ten times previously, with England winning nine of those matches.\nPakistan had previously played a home series in Malaysia as part of the 2017–20 ICC Women's Championship, against Australia, in October 2018. Ahead of the tour, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that Bismah Maroof would continue as captain of the team for the matches. Sana Mir, Pakistan's most capped player in women's cricket, announced that she had taken a break from international cricket, and missed the tour.\nEngland won the WODI series, after taking an unassailable lead with wins in the first two matches. The final match finished as a no result due to rain, therefore England won the series 2–0. England also won the first two WT20I matches to secure a series win. England won the third and final match by 24 runs to win the series 3–0."

        "title": "1988–89 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1988–89 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey team represented the Harvard University in college ice hockey. In its 18th year under head coach Bill Cleary the team compiled a 31–3–0 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the fourteenth time. The Crimson defeated Minnesota 4–3 in overtime to win the championship game at the St. Paul Civic Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota.\nSeason.\nAfter spending the previous year playing for the US National Team at the 1988 Winter Olympics, Lane MacDonald and Allen Bourbeau returned to Harvard and led a very experienced team that was looking to being the Crimson its first national championship. MacDonald was named team captain and placed on the top line along with Bourbeau and C. J. Young. Over the course of the season Harvard was led by its upper-classmen, with nearly two thirds of the game-to-game roster coming from the veterans. However, the Crimson got major contributions from underclassmen as well. Sophomores Peter Ciavaglia and Ted Donato earned their place on the second line with the former leading the team in scoring. In net Bill Cleary decided to go with a goaltending tandem with the two freshmen Allain Roy and Chuckie Hughes alternating starts.\nFast start.\nThe Crimson began the year with five wins against different conference opponents, though none were particularly strong squads. The first real test for Harvard came against Hockey East powerhouse Boston College where the two Boston-area rivals battled into overtime where the ivy-leaguers took the game. In the three succeeding games Harvard absolutely pounded their ECAC opponents, scoring 27 goals and routing the competition. Harvard ended 1988 with a pair of games against New Hampshire teams. After an overtime win over UNH the Crimson smashed long-time rival Dartmouth 10–0, Harvard's only shutout of the season.\nNumber one.\nHarvard began the second half of its season in early January and looked to have lost a bit of a step during their three-week break; they continued to win games but their massive goal differentials had vanished. Just when it looked like they were vulnerable, however, the Crimson soundly beat previously-undefeated St. Lawrence and claimed the #1 ranking. The 15–0 Crimson were off to their best start since the depression but couldn't build on their lead for another two weeks. When they finally returned to the ice at the end of the month their offense was nowhere to be found against their arch-rival Yale and Harvard suffered its first loss of the season. The Crimson recovered for the next two games, winning easily against two of the conference's worst teams, before heading to the Boston Garden for the start of the Beanpot.\nBeanpot champion.\nDespite Harvard's success throughout the 1980s the program hadn't won a Beanpot semifinal since 1981 and they wouldn't have an easy task in the first game as they faced Boston College who were looking for revenge after the earlier loss. Once more the squads fought a close game but Harvard was able to come out as the victor once more, setting up a championship showdown against Boston University a week later. In the meantime Harvard played a pair of road games and suffered their second loss of the season, losing in overtime to 3rd-place Colgate. The Beanpot championship came two days after the loss and Harvard's forwards ran roughshod over the Terriers, scoring nine times to win the match and give the program its ninth Beanpot title.\nHarvard faced a bit of a gauntlet in the final two weeks of the regular season, going up against two of the top teams in the conference, but Harvard was able to sweep both weekends and cement its 4th-consecutive ECAC title.\nECAC tournament.\nHarvard began the conference tournament by hosting Rensselaer in the best-of-three quarterfinals and won two games handily. The Crimson headed back to Boston Garden for the championship rounds and found themselves in a touch match against the upstart Vermont Catamounts. They fought to a 2–2 draw after regulation and when the sixth-seed team were the ones to find the back of the net Harvard headed to its third consolation game of in four years. While they won the match against Cornell, Harvard's loss in the semifinal gave the top eastern seed to Maine despite the Crimson's 27–3 record.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe slightly lowering of their ranking still gave Harvard a first-round bye in the national tournament, allowing the Crimson to wait at home for their opponent. In late March Harvard played their final home games of the season against defending national champion Lake Superior State and the difference between the two could not have been greater. While Harvard was a fast-skating finesse team, the Lakers were a hard-nosed checking group that relied on their All-American goalie Bruce Hoffort to bail them out on the penalty kill. Harvard's goaltending tandem were able to keep LSSU from scoring much in the two games, allowing the Crimson to win both games and advance to their fourth Frozen Four of the decade.\nIn the semifinal Harvard faced the team that had stopped them from winning the 1986 championship in Michigan State. The senior class for MSU remembered the win over Harvard and leading-scorer Bobby Reynolds remarked:\n\"Thank God we're not playing Minnesota.\"\nThe relief over facing the Ivy-leaguers was soon erased when Harvard scored twice in the first while Allain Roy stood on his head to make a spectacular save on Reynolds' wrap-around chance. In the end it was the boys from the east who skated away with the victory in front of a mostly-MSU cheering 15,000.\nTitle Game.\nThe championship game pitted two teams who had been desperately trying to win the title over the previous decade but came up empty each year. While Harvard wore their home whites it was Minnesota who had a sellout crowd cheering for them in their backyard of Saint Paul. Just prior to the game Lane MacDonald received the Hobey Baker Award, giving both teams a national player of the year (Robb Stauber had won the award in 1988). Both teams were anxious to win the championship and came out flying at the start of the game. Minnesota got on the board first with a fairly soft goal from the stick of Jon Anderson. In Harvard's zeal to tie up the game they took three consecutive penalties in the first period but the penalty kill, which had been good all season, stood strong and prevented Minnesota from extending its lead.\nIn the second it was Minnesota's turn in the box and the Gophers received three straight minors to start the middle frame. In the second power play for Harvard, Ted Donato fired a shot from the point and the puck sailed past Stauber's glove to tie the score. Four minutes later, just after the Gophers killed off the third penalty, Lane MacDonald managed to get behind Minnesota's defensemen and cut across the front of the net before beating a sprawled Stauber to give Harvard its first lead. Three and a half minutes later Minnesota finally broke through on the power play and the two teams skated into intermission tied at 2.\nMinnesota had the balance of power in the third but it was Donato who found the back of the net first, giving Harvard the lead with just over 7 minutes to play. The Gophers fought furiously to tie the score and managed to do just that on their third power play of the period. In overtime Minnesota nearly won the game when a shot from Randy Skarda beat Chuckie Hughes' blocker but it hit the post square and bounced straight back. A few minutes later Harvard won a faceoff in Minnesota's end and Brian McCormack shot a puck from the point. It rebounded off of Stauber and, while Peter Ciavaglia was being tackled by Skarda, Ed Krayer picked up the puck, skated a few feet towards the corner and backhanded a puck that eluded Stauber. The overtime goal silenced the partisan crowd while the cheers from the Harvard squad echoed throughout the building.\nAwards and honors.\nTed Donato's two goals in the final games helped him win tournament MOP honors, and he was joined on the All-Tournament team by Kevin Sneddon, Lane MacDonald and Allain Roy. MacDonald's Hobey Baker award was the third for Harvard in a seven-year span and he was the only member of the team to make the AHCA All-American East First Team though linemate C. J. Young made the Second Team. MacDonald was also ECAC Player of the Year and an All-ECAC First Team member. Young, Allen Bourbeau and Peter Ciavaglia made second-team all-conference. As they had been equally critical to the team's success all season, it was fitting that Allain Roy and Chuckie Hughes shared the goaltending spot on the All-ECAC Rookie Team.\nHead Coach Bill Cleary remained behind the bench for one more season before becoming the Athletic Director, leaving the '89 season as crowning jewel of his illustrious career.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Mode that is designed as same as the Tournament, only for two players. The latter is not played simultaneously but the players will alternate their turns instead. The goal is to travel through the waves that are moving in a certain direction while picking up the buoys scattered around and doing specific tricks, before the time limit expires. Each course requires the players to collect a certain number of points before progressing to the next one. They can be obtained by collecting markers or performing tricks.\nIn the Tournament mode, each series consists of six stages. Once a single series is completed, the next competition starts with the same amount of levels and with progressively more difficult conditions. At the beginning, only two difficulty levels are unlocked, easy and intermediate. As each of these are completed, new ones are opening, such as pro or semi pro. The players can choose from eleven different characters, like Kelly Sunset or Mark Mavericks. Each of them have slightly different stats.\nDevelopment.\n\"\" is a reworked version of \"Surfroid\". As a result, the plot that revolved around aliens and the planetary doomsday was cut off from this version.\nReception.\nThe game received \"generally unfavorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Daniel Erickson of \"NextGen\" said that the game was \"One cute gimmick away from absolute crap.\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 30 out of 40. Four-Eyed Dragon of \"GamePro\" said, \"Don't expect any Maverick thrills in this disappointing surfer. While it looks like the perfect wave and has an innovative way of controlling your boarder with a miniature surfboard that attaches to both analog sticks, fails to stay afloat with fun gameplay.\""

        "text": "The 1987–88 Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey team represented the Lake Superior State University in college ice hockey. In its 6th year under head coach Frank Anzalone the team compiled a 33–7–6 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the second time. The Lakers defeated St. Lawrence 4–3 in overtime to win the championship game at the Olympic Center in Lake Placid, New York.\nSeason.\nRegular season consistency.\nThe Lakers had played well ever since Frank Anzalone took over in the middle of the 1982–83 season. With the success of the program he was able to recruit players who had a good chance at playing professionally. Included in the bumper crop of freshmen were goaltender Bruce Hoffort and New Jersey Devils draft pick Jim Dowd. While the newcomers, particularly Hoffort, would make major contributions to the team it was the upper classmen who led the way.\nMark Vermette, who scored only a single goal in his freshman season, exploded out of the gate and helped Lake Superior build an early lead in the conference standings. The Lakers never found themselves on any long winning streaks but they rode Vermette's sudden scoring flurry to wins almost every weekend. The Lakers lost only a single game in each of the first three months of the season and ended 1987 with as many ties as losses (3 each).\nThe second half of the season was no different with the Lakers continuing to build on their lead in the CCHA, losing only one more conference game the rest of the year and finishing with a massive 10-point lead over second-place Bowling Green. The Lakers won only their second CCHA title (the first in 14 years) and were ranked so highly that it was possible for them to make the NCAA tournament bases solely on their regular season. They had achieved such heights with a combination of scoring and tough, physical play they earned them around 1,000 penalty minutes in just 38 games.\nCCHA tournament.\nLake Superior ran through 8th-place Ohio State winning the quarterfinal series handily. For the championship rounds the Lakers headed to Detroit to face Western Michigan, who had given them fits during the season. The semifinal saw no difference as the two teams fought to a 4–4 draw in regulation, leading to the fourth overtime game on the season between the two. This time the Lake State was able to emerge as the victor and head to the conference championship game. The final gamed followed a similar pattern to the semifinal with the Lakers and Bowling Green knotted at 2-all after 60 minutes but the Lakers could not get a second consecutive overtime goal and missed a chance to win their first ever conference tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nDespite the loss, Lake Superior had won 30 games by that point, a new program record, and were given the #2 western seed, allowing them to bypass the first round of the tournament and await their opponent at home. After a week off, the Lakers played host to Merrimack, a Division III team who had received the final At-Large bid into the tournament. Despite not much being expected of them, the Warriors had taken down the Hockey East champion in the first round then stunned the Lakers in game 1 of the quarterfinals 3–4. Fortunately for lake Superior, at the time the tournament format had the first two rounds being two-game total-goal series and they could get away with a poor effort in one game. Sure enough Lake Superior rebounded with 5–1 win in the second and took the series to advance to their first Frozen Four.\nIn the national semifinal Lake State faced its toughest challenge yet, the top-ranked Maine Black Bears. It was, however, the Lakers' tenacity that won out in the end. While Mane came in with the top offense in the country, Lake Superior was able to win the majority of puck battles and double up the vaunted easterners 6–3.\nFor their first championship appearance, Lake Superior faced an equally unlikely opponent in St. Lawrence who had outlasted western powerhouse Minnesota the night after. The two unheralded teams each tried to play their game and it was St. Lawrence who looked to be the better of the two early. With the Lakers getting into penalty trouble the Saints fired 20 shots on goal in the first period but Hoffort stood tall and turned everything aside. St. Lawrence was finally able to solve Hoffort in the second period, pumping three goals into the net in the middle frame.\nThird-period controversy.\nWith the game tied 3–3 late in the third period, St. Lawrence got the puck near the front of the net and had an opportunity to score when future U.S. Congressman Pete Stauber intentionally knocked the net off of its moorings. This violation would normally cause a penalty shot to be called, but referee Frank Cole only called for a face-off. The building, full of St. Lawrence partisans, booed what they felt was an obvious missed call but the Lakers were able to escape unscathed.\nThe game headed into overtime and wear and tear of playing back-to-back games started to show on St. Lawrence. Lake Superior attacked the Saints' cage and just before the 5-minute mark, Vermette slid a rebound through a maze of bodies into the net and gave Lake Superior its first national title.\nAwards and honors.\nBruce Hoffort's 49-saves in the title game helped him earn the tournament MOP and was joined by Kord Cernich and Mike DeCarle on the All-Tournament team. Mark Vermette led the NCAA in goals, setting a program record with 45 on the season and is the only Laker in history to reach the 40-goal plateau (as of 2019). His goal-scoring frenzy made him a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award but that year it would go to Minnesota's Robb Stauber, Pete's brother. Vermette had to settle for being named an AHCA first-team All-American while head coach Frank Anzalone received the Spencer Penrose Award as the national coach of the year. Hoffort's 2.65 goals against average was also the best for qualifying goalies in the nation.\nVermette was named the CCHA Player of the Year, the first Laker to win the award, while Anzalone won the CCHA Coach of the Year. Vermette and Hoffort were named to the All-CCHA First Team while Cernich and DeCarle made the Second Team.\nSchedule.\nThe team's schedule was a s follows:\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRoster and scoring statistics.\nThe roster and scoring statistics were as follows:\nPlayers drafted into the NHL.\n1988 NHL Entry Draft.\nThe player selected in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft were as follows:"

        "text": "The 1910–11 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team (variously \"North Carolina\", \"Carolina\" or \"Tar Heels\") was the first varsity college basketball team to represent the University of North Carolina. The school created a committee to determine if the school should go forward with forming a team as there was increasing pressure from students, the student run newspaper \"The Tar Heel\", in-state schools that fielded teams who wanted to form a state league, and the University of Tennessee inquired about scheduling a game in February 1911. Equipment was purchased and installed at Bynum Gymnasium after a period of uncertainty of where the team would play its home games. Then track-and-field head coach Nathaniel Cartmell – who had little experience with basketball – was chosen to coach as there were no funds to be allocated for hiring another coach. After choosing players for the first team, Cartmell finalized the schedule in January, which was limited as many other programs had already created their schedules before the Tar Heels made their team.\nNorth Carolina opened their season with a victory against Virginia Christian 42–21 in front of an estimated 200 spectators. The squad won their next four games, winning by double digits against two opponents and by three or less against the other two. The team traveled to Wake Forest where they lost their first game after the Baptists handily outscored the Tar Heels in the second half. The team rebounded with a win against University of Tennessee before they dropped two closely contested games against Virginia and Virginia Christian. Carolina defeated Woodberry Forest easily before they played their final game, a rematch, against Virginia. Virginia won the game after taking a lead into halftime and only being outscored by two points in the second half, despite one player from each team being ejected following an altercation where a North Carolina player bit a Virginia player on the shoulder. The team was viewed as a success and thought to have played their hardest in each game this led \"The Tar Heel\" to write that \"... basketball has come to stay.\"\nFormation.\nBasketball was first played at the University of North Carolina as early as 1903, but it was formally introduced in 1906 by Dr. Robert Lawson. Lawson obtained a rule book, placed peach baskets for rims and fielded a team. During the 1909–10 academic year there was a school group that played basketball and had their photo published in the school annual \"The Yackety Yack\". In late 1910, students showed an eagerness to field a basketball team when the editors of \"The Tar Heel\" published articles in the newspapers and mentioned it would \"relieve some of that January and February monotony.\" In addition, Wake Forest College showed interest in creating a statewide basketball league. On September 24, 1910, student Marvin Ritch who had been away from the university previously, returned, prompting \"The Tar Heel\" editors expressed their hope again for him to form a team and schedule games. Four days later, it was revealed that University of Tennessee had inquired about scheduling a basketball game on February 24. The following week, \"The Tar Heel\" commented that \"Carolina will certainly have a basketball team this winter,\" as well as mentioning that former Olympian and current track-and-field coach Nathaniel Cartmell was interested in fielding a team. The writers continued, stating that basketball interest had waned on campus in the years prior and some had even considered cutting up the basketball area for tennis courts.\nA four–person committee was formed to investigate the \"advisability\" of forming a basketball team at the school. The committee determined several matters including: basketball was popular in college sports, many leading Southern colleges and universities had established teams which were as popular as other varsity sports, and it would be a source of revenue. One issue was found as the team would have no were to play, but despite this, the committee suggested the school form a team at once. By the end of November, the a home court had yet to be determined, to which \"The Tar Heel\" editors suggested Memorial Hall since it was only used two or three times a year then. In addition, former Olympian and current track and field coach Cartmell had been named head coach. It was revealed later that there weren't funds to hire another coach, so Cartmell was approached even though knew little about basketball. On December 3, a basketball \"apparatus\" was ordered and upon its installation in Bynum Gymnasium and that practices would be from 7 to 9 PM. The baskets were installed on December 12 and each night after that students showed up to practice at the set time, with around 25 coming the first night. The practice that night reportedly had slick floors and backboards were \"too lively.\"\nRoster and schedule.\n!colspan=6 style=\"background:#4B9CD3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular season\nRegular season.\nCoach Cartmell also had the duty of scheduling the games for the newly formed basketball team, along with serving as the referee or umpire depending on the half. The preliminary schedule was announced in mid–January and was noted to be difficult to make as most schools had their schedules already created by the point Cartmell began the process. In total there were eleven games and it was found to be a good schedule as it included \"some of the best teams of this and other States.\" The team's first game was a home game against Virginia Christian on January 27. Before the game, captain Ritch told the team \"... play for team and forget yourself.\" \"The Tar Heel\" commented that the North Carolina players looked nervous in the opening minutes and, despite this, neither team got an advantage greater than five in the first half. Entering half–time the score was 13–11 Carolina. At halftime, Cartmell cursed at the team \"good and artistically\" before the action resumed and Caroline opened the first five minutes of the half making five baskets to Virginia Christian's nil. Virginia Christian began to play better following, but it did not prove enough as the Tar Heels won 42–21. \"The Tar Heel\" wrote that the game was attended by \"a number of people\" which they estimated to be around 200 people, which they speculated most had not seen a basketball game contested before and stated they left happy with the experience.\nThe next opponent was the Durham Y.M.C.A. in a game where the referee called several fouls and the pace of the game was very slow. Carolina won handily 60–18, while 10 of the Y.M.C.A.'s points came as a result of fouls. No individual stats were recorded for the first three games of the season. The Wake Forest Anti-bonders (variously \"Baptists\" and \"Water Babies\") traveled to Chapel Hill where the two played a close game. North Carolina led the whole game, but primarily over a margin of 3 points. \"The Tar Heel\" wrote that the Baptists had better team chemistry, but just did not make the easy shots that received. The Baptists were led by strong performances from Turner and Dowd, but were unable to overcome the Tar Heels' advantage and lost the game 28–31. Following their third straight victory, \"The Tar Heel\" wrote that the players should not think they're the best in the South and that they needed to improve their passing and general teamwork. Carolina squared off against the Davidson Predestinarians next on February 8. The Tar Heels scored 15 points to Davidson's 8 in the first half; however, Davidson played much better defense in the second half and were able to score several baskets. Their efforts fell short as they lost 27–25. The Charlotte Y.M.C.A. team came to Chapel Hill for the next match–up on February 15, where the Tar Heels won the game 42–28 after being separated by four points at halftime. It was not that the team showed improved passing relative to previous outings. Ritch scored a season high 18 points, which broke the early program record set by Tillet against Davidson when he had 8 points.\nNext on the schedule was a rematch against Wake Forest in the team's first away game. The Baptists and Tar Heels stayed close in the first half as the Baptists held a slight lead at 15–10 entering the half. The second half was dominated by Wake Forest as they scored 23 points to Carolina's 6, bringing the final score to 38–16 and handing the Tar Heels their program's first loss. \"The Tar Heel\" reported that the Carolina squad played \"decidedly off color\" and lacked their usual game, while \"The Charlotte Observer\" reported it was the \"toughest game of basketball ever on the home field of Wake Forest...\" Tennessee traveled to Chapel Hill for the next game, which was played in Bynum Gymnasium following a dance and the floor was \"slick\" and preventing the team's from playing fast. Despite this, Carolina outscored Tennessee 26–6 in the first half and maintained the lead for the remainder, closing it out 40–21. In advance of the next game against Virginia, \"The Tar Heel\" stressed the game's importance as it read: \"... we are ready to do anything that is fair and square to beat the Old Dominion representative.\" The rules for the game were different than the seven Carolina had played prior, Virginia played the game under intercollegiate rules which allowed dribbling. Previously, the Tar Heels had played under the Y.M.C.A.'s rules. In addition, Virginia's players all outweighed the Tar Heels'. In front of a crowd of 400, the game remained scoreless for the first four minutes before Virginia opened the game's scoring. Virginia and Carolina entered halftime tied at 9–9 after Ritch making a foul shot and Hanes making a \"difficult\" shot. Virginia stretched their lead to four, at 13–9, upon the opening of the half. Carolina managed to close the gap to one, 16–15. With two minutes remaining, the North Carolina's Ritch missed a shot and the next possession saw the Haynes miss a foul shot to level the score. Virginia made one more basket before time expired, to bring the final score to 18–15.\nThe Tar Heels traveled to Lynchburg, Virginia for a rematch against Virginia Christian. Carolina had the advantage at the half 17–12, but the Christians rallied and in the closing seconds the score was level at 31 apiece. Virginia Christian's Stickley sunk a shot in overtime to give the Christians the win 33–31. The following day, the Tar Heels played against Woodberry Forest in what was described as a slow game where the home team Woodberry was \"outclassed.\" After the Tar Heels' victory, coach Cartmell felt his team's performance was poor and said: \"They are on a bloody slump.\" The final game of the season took place in at Virginia's home venue. Virginia won the first half with a score of 16–7. In the second half, Ritch bit Virginia's Bertram on the shoulder and then hit the ground. Both were subsequently ejected. Virginia's early advantage proved to be enough as the Tar Heels outscored Virginia in the second half 9–7, bringing the final score to 24–16. \"The Tar Heel\" wrote that North Carolina shot poorly throughout the game and thus Virginia did not have to try its best after establishing the early lead. Ritch closed the season as the leading scorer with 76 points.\nAftermath and legacy.\n\"The Charlotte Observer\" wrote after North Carolina's loss to Wake Forest that the team was very good considering it was their first year and expected them to be one of the best in the South in a few years time. Following the team's final game, \"The Tar Heel\" wrote that the season was a success, the students supported the squad well, and felt that \"... basketball has come to stay.\" The newspaper writers felt that the team fought \"like snarling cats\" in each game. It further stated that Virginia was one of the best teams in the South and thus their losses their did not look bad. Four of the team's members were from Charlotte and planned to play together in the summer, which \"The Tar Heel\" felt would make for a \"well trained team next year.\" The \"Greensboro Daily News\" agreed and stated the Tar Heels performance for the season was \"beyond expectations.\""

        "text": "The curling competitions of the 2022 Winter Olympics were held at the Beijing National Aquatics Centre, one of the Olympic Green venues. Curling competitions were scheduled for every day of the games, from February 2 to February 20. This was the eighth time that curling was part of the Olympic program.\nIn each of the men's, women's, and mixed doubles competitions, 10 nations competed. The mixed doubles competition was expanded for its second appearance in the Olympics. A total of 120 quota spots (60 per sex) were distributed to the sport of curling, an increase of four from the 2018 Winter Olympics. A total of 3 events were contested, one for men, one for women, and one mixed.\nQualification.\nQualification to the Men's and Women's curling tournaments at the Winter Olympics was determined through two methods (in addition to the host nation). Nations qualified teams by placing in the top six at the 2021 World Curling Championships. Teams could also qualify through Olympic qualification events which were held in 2021. Six nations qualified via World Championship qualification placement, while three nations qualified through qualification events. In men's and women's play, a host will be selected for the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE). They would be joined by the teams which competed at the 2021 World Championships but did not qualify for the Olympics, and two qualifiers from the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event (Pre-OQE). The Pre-OQE was open to all member associations.\nFor the mixed doubles competition in 2022, the tournament field was expanded from eight competitor nations to ten. The top seven ranked teams at the 2021 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship qualified, along with two teams from the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE) – Mixed Doubles. This OQE was open to a nominated host and the fifteen nations with the highest qualification points not already qualified to the Olympics. As the host nation, China qualified teams automatically, thus making a total of ten teams per event in the curling tournaments.\nCompetition schedule.\nCurling competitions started two days before the Opening Ceremony and finished on the last day of the games, meaning the sport was the only one to have had a competition every day of the games. The following was the competition schedule for the curling competitions:\nResults summary.\nMen's tournament.\nPlayoffs.\nSemifinals.\n\"Thursday, 17 February, 20:05\"\nBronze medal game.\n\"Friday, 18 February, 14:05\"\nGold medal game.\n\"Saturday, 19 February, 14:50\"\nWomen's tournament.\nPlayoffs.\nSemifinals.\n\"Friday, 18 February, 20:05\"\nBronze medal game.\n\"Saturday, 19 February, 20:05\"\nGold medal game.\n\"Sunday, 20 February, 9:05\"\nMixed doubles tournament.\nPlayoffs.\nSemifinals.\n\"Monday, 7 February, 20:05\"\nBronze medal game.\n\"Tuesday, 8 February, 14:05\"\nGold medal game.\n\"Tuesday, 8 February, 20:05\"\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 114 athletes from 14 nations (including the IOC's designation of ROC) were scheduled to participate (the numbers of athletes are shown in parentheses). Some curlers competed in both the 4-person and mixed doubles tournament, therefore, the numbers included on this list are the total athletes sent by each NOC to the Olympics, not how many athletes they qualified. Both Australia and the Czech Republic made their Olympic sport debuts."

It was run on November 2, 2019 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California with a purse of $6,000,000. The race was won by Vino Rosso.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nThe race was broadcast on NBC with a post time of 5:44 PM Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) – prime time on the East Coast.\nContenders.\nPre-entries for the 2019 Classic were announced on October 21 with the post position draw held on October 28.\nThe 2019 Classic was considered to be wide open, given that the major races in the division for both three-year-olds and older male horses were split between many contenders. The favorite was McKinzie, a 4-year-old colt who had finished either first or second in all of his starts in 2019, including a win in the Whitney Handicap. The top-ranked three-year-old in the race was Code of Honor, who had won the Travers Stakes and Jockey Club Gold Cup, the latter by disqualification. The mare Elate attempted to become just the second female horse to win the race, the other being Zenyatta in 2009.\nThe other entries were:\nRace description.\nWar of Will went to the early lead and set moderate fractions, pressed by Mongolian Groom and McKinzie, who had to check strides a few times along the rail. Vino Rosso was a few lengths further back in fourth, then began his move on the far turn while racing three wide. McKinzie had also started his drive, moving to the lead at the head of the stretch. Vino Rosso gradually closed the gap to McKinzie, then pulled away in the final sixteenth of a mile to win by lengths.\nIt was the first Breeders' Cup Classic win for all of Vino Rosso's connections: co-owners Mike Repole (Repole Stable) and Vince Viola (St Elias Stable), trainer Todd Pletcher and jockey Irad Ortiz Jr.\nPletcher felt that the colt's earlier win in the Gold Cup at Santa Anita, run over the same course and distance, was pivotal to his success in the Classic. \"It gave us confidence that the horse handled the track\", he said. \"We had a blueprint in place that worked. So we tried to follow that pattern exactly, and we did.\"\nJoel Rosario, who rode McKinzie, felt his horse simply got tired. \"I let him run a little bit on the backside just to get my spot\", he said. \"That might have cost him a little bit. He ran his heart out, so we can't be too disappointed. We were just beaten by the best horse on the day.\"\nMongolian Groom suffered a severe injury to his left hind leg during the stretch run and was later euthanized. Santa Anita had instigated a number of changes to enhance equine safety after a troubling number of deaths during its winter/spring meeting. \"It's something we were all very concerned about coming in\", said Pletcher. \"I think everyone took every possible precautionary measure.\"\nResults.\nTimes: – 23.09; – 47.16; – 1:10.71; mile – 1:36.35; final – 2:02.80.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (23.09) (24.07) (23.55) (25.64) (26.45)\nSource: Equibase Chart\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

They acquired Chris Crawford and Terrell Stoglin as American import players. The team lost the first two games of the season, after which the team released Stoglin from their roster. After this, Douanes won three straight games and was able to qualify for the playoffs after they defeated the defending champions US Monastir on the final game day.

Behind 28 points from Jean Jacques Boissy and 26 points from Crawford, Douanes beat the Angolan team in what was widely considered to be a shocking win.

        "text": "Craig Reynolds (born June 15, 1996) is an American football running back for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Kutztown, and signed with the Washington Redskins as an undrafted free agent following the 2019 NFL Draft.\nCollege career.\nReynolds was a member of the Kutztown Golden Bears for five seasons, redshirting as a true freshman. As a redshirt sophomore, he was named first-team All-Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) East after leading the conference with 1,189 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns. Reynolds rushed 109 times for 456 yards and four touchdowns, had 29 receptions for 410 yards and five touchdowns and returned four kickoffs for 108 yards and nine punts for 153 yards and one touchdown before suffering a season-ending injury eight games into the season and was again named first-team All-PSAC East. As a redshirt senior, he was named first-team All-PSAC East for a third straight season after rushing for 823 yards and 15 touchdowns on 172 carries and catching 40 passes for 472 yards and three touchdowns while also completing a seven-yard pass for another touchdown and gaining 380 return yards. Reynolds finished his collegiate career as the schools third all-time leading rusher with 2,650 yards and second in school history with 5,277 all-purpose yards.\nProfessional career.\nWashington Redskins.\nReynolds signed with the Washington Redskins as an undrafted free agent after participating in a rookie mini camp with the team on May 13, 2019. He was waived during final roster cuts at the end of training camp, but resigned to the team's practice squad the following day on September 1, 2019. Reynolds was promoted to the Redskins active roster on October 19, 2019 and made his NFL debut the following day against the San Francisco 49ers, playing on special teams. On November 5, 2019, Reynolds was waived by the Redskins.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn November 12, 2019, Reynolds was signed to the Atlanta Falcons practice squad. On December 30, 2019, Reynolds was signed to a reserve/future contract.\nOn August 7, 2020, Reynolds was waived by the Falcons, but re-signed on August 27. He was waived on September 5, 2020.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nOn September 14, 2020, Reynolds was signed to the Jacksonville Jaguars practice squad, and was released a week later. On November 21, 2020, Reynolds was re-signed to the practice squad. He was signed to the active roster on November 28. Reynolds was waived on December 5, 2020, and re-signed to the practice squad three days later. He was elevated to the active roster on December 26 for the team's week 16 game against the Chicago Bears, and reverted to the practice squad after the game. He signed a reserve/future contract on January 4, 2021. He was waived on March 17, 2021.\nDetroit Lions.\nOn August 12, 2021, Reynolds signed with the Detroit Lions. He was waived on August 31, 2021 and re-signed to the practice squad the next day.

Reynolds was elevated again the following week and made his first career start in a 30-12 win over the Arizona Cardinals, rushing for 112 yards on 26 carries.

        "title": "List of Wimbledon broadcasters",
        "text": "Beginning with the 2018 tournament, an in-house operation known as Wimbledon Broadcasting Services (WBS) has served as the official host broadcaster of the tournament, replacing BBC Sport.\nUnited Kingdom.\nSince 1937 the BBC has broadcast the tournament on television in the UK. The matches covered are primarily split between its two main terrestrial channels, BBC One and BBC Two, and their Red Button service. This can result in live matches being moved across all 3 channels. The BBC holds the broadcast rights for Wimbledon until 2024. ITV covered Wimbledon live from 1956 to 1968, but for fewer hours each day than the BBC. Fred Perry was their lead commentator. During the days of British Satellite Broadcasting, its sports channel carried extra coverage of Wimbledon for subscribers. One of the most notable British commentators was Dan Maskell, who was known as the BBC's \"voice of tennis\" until his retirement in 1991. John Barrett succeeded him in that role until he retired in 2006. Current commentators working for the BBC at Wimbledon include British ex-players Andrew Castle, John Lloyd, Tim Henman, Samantha Smith and Mark Petchey; tennis legends such as John McEnroe, Tracy Austin and Boris Becker; and general sports commentators including Andrew Cotter and Nick Mullins. The coverage is presented by Sue Barker (live) and Clare Balding (highlights). Previous BBC presenters include Des Lynam, David Vine, John Inverdale and Harry Carpenter.\nThe Wimbledon Finals are obliged to be shown live and in full on terrestrial television (BBC Television Service, ITV, Channel 4, or Channel 5) by government mandate. Highlights of the rest of the tournament must be provided by terrestrial stations; live coverage (excepting the finals) may be sought by satellite or cable TV.\nThe BBC was forced to apologise after many viewers complained about \"over-talking\" by its commentary team during the TV coverage of the event in 2011. It said in a statement that views on commentary were subjective but that they \"do appreciate that over-talking can irritate our audience\". The BBC added that it hoped it had achieved \"the right balance\" across its coverage and was \"of course sorry if on occasion you have not been satisfied\". Tim Henman and John McEnroe were among the ex-players commentating.\nWimbledon was also involved in a piece of television history, when on 1 July 1967 the first official colour television broadcast took place in the UK. Four hours live coverage of the 1967 Championships was shown on BBC Two, which was the first television channel in Europe to regularly broadcast in colour. Footage of that historic match no longer survives, however, the Gentlemen's Final of that year is still held in the BBC archives because it was the first Gentlemen's Final transmitted in colour. The tennis balls used were traditionally white, but were switched to yellow in 1986 to make them stand out for colour television. Since 2007, Wimbledon matches have been transmitted in high-definition, originally on the BBC's free-to-air channel BBC HD, with continual live coverage during the tournament of Centre Court and Court No. 1 as well as an evening highlights show \"Today at Wimbledon\". Coverage is now shown on BBC One and Two's HD feeds. Beginning 2018, all centre court matches are televised in 4K ultra-high-definition.\nThe BBC's opening theme music for Wimbledon was composed by Keith Mansfield and is titled \"Light and Tuneful\". A piece titled \"A Sporting Occasion\" is the traditional closing theme, though nowadays coverage typically ends either with a montage set to a popular song or with no music at all. Mansfield also composed the piece \"World Champion\", used by NBC during intervals (change-overs, set breaks, etc.) and at the close of broadcasts throughout the tournament.\nCommmentators.\nBelow is a list of men's singles final commentators for BBC TV.\nBelow is a list of men's singles final commentators for ITV.\nDan Maskell began commentating on the Wimbledon Championships in 1949 as an expert summariser for BBC Radio alongside Max Robertson, before switching to television in 1951 with Freddie Grisewood. He would remain as the \"voice of tennis\" on the BBC until his retirement in 1991. When commenting on a particularly exciting piece of play or an outstanding shot, he sometimes used his most remembered and revered catchphrase \"Oh, I say!\". The last Wimbledon match that he commentated on was the 1991 Men's Singles final between Michael Stich and Boris Becker (which Stich won). The last tennis match Maskell commentated on for BBC Television was the 1991 Grand Slam Cup final between David Wheaton and Michael Chang.\nJohn Barrett's broadcasting career with BBC Television began in 1971. Barrett began commentating on Wimbledon men's singles finals for BBC Television at the end of the 1970s. Barrett's voice was heard on the BBC broadcast of the epic fourth set tiebreak between Borg and McEnroe in the 1980 final (this has often been shown again on TV). Barrett commentated on Wimbledon men's singles finals until 1998. David Mercer took over from Barrett for the 1999 and 2000 men's singles finals, but Barrett commentated on the 2001 and 2002 finals. From 2003, Andrew Castle commentated on Wimbledon men's singles finals instead of Barrett. Barrett announced his retirement from the BBC commentary box at Wimbledon in 2006.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, ABC began showing taped highlights of the Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles Final in the 1960s on its \"Wide World of Sports\" series. NBC began a 43-year run of covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen's Singles Final. In 1979, the network began carrying the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles Finals live. For the next few decades, Americans made a tradition of NBC's \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\" specials at weekends. Live coverage started early in the morning (the US being a minimum of 5 hours behind the UK) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from Bud Collins, whose tennis acumen and famous patterned trousers were well known to tennis fans in the US. Collins was sacked by NBC in 2007, but was promptly hired by ESPN, the cable home for The Championships in the States. For many years NBC's primary Wimbledon host was veteran broadcaster Dick Enberg.\nFrom 1975 to 1999, premium channel HBO carried weekday coverage of Wimbledon. Hosts included Jim Lampley, Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, John Lloyd and Barry MacKay among others. ESPN took over as the cable-television partner in 2003.\nThe AELTC grew frustrated with NBC's policy of waiting to begin its quarterfinal and semifinal coverage until after the conclusion of \"Today\" at 10 a.m. local, as well as broadcasting live only to the Eastern Time Zone and using tape-delay in all others. NBC also held over high-profile matches for delayed broadcast in its window, regardless of any ongoing matches. In one notorious incident in 2009, ESPN2's coverage of the Tommy Haas-Novak Djokovic quarterfinal was forced off the air nationwide when it ran past 10 a.m. Eastern, after which NBC showed the conclusion of the match on tape only after presenting the previous Ivo Karlović-Roger Federer quarterfinal in full. Beginning with the 2012 tournament, coverage moved to ESPN and ESPN2, marking the second major tennis championship (after the Australian Open) where live coverage is exclusively on pay television. The finals are also broadcast tape-delayed on ABC.\nTaped coverage using the world feed is aired in primetime and overnights on Tennis Channel and is branded \"Wimbledon Primetime\".\nFrom 1968 to 1972, Bud Collins worked for CBS Sports during its coverage of the US Open tournament, moving to NBC Sports in 1972 to work that network's Wimbledon coverage. During the 2007 Wimbledon tournament, Collins announced that NBC had chosen not to renew his contract and was letting him go. Collins had covered tennis for the network for 35 years. He insisted that he had no plans to retire and would continue to cover tennis for \"The Boston Globe\". On July 8, 2007, the final day of the tournament, fellow \"Globe\" sportswriter Bob Ryan, on the ESPN TV show \"The Sports Reporters\", ridiculed NBC for this decision. He said the 78-year-old Collins \"still has his fastball\" and praised the \"Globe\" for retaining Collins. Collins was hired by ESPN on August 7, 2007. He teamed with onetime NBC partner Dick Enberg on the network's Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, and Australian Open coverage. He has also covered the US Open for XM Satellite Radio.\nAs NBC's voice of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, the last tournament for him being in 1999 (alongside Bud Collins and, later, John McEnroe), Dick Enberg regularly concluded the network's coverage of the two-week event with thematically appropriate observations accompanied by a montage of video clips. Beginning in 2004, Enberg served as a play-by-play announcer for ESPN2's coverage of the Wimbledon and French Open tennis tournaments, adding the Australian Open the following year. Enberg came to ESPN on lease from CBS, where he already called the US Open, the one Grand Slam tournament not covered by ESPN until 2009. At the 2004 French Open, Enberg called a match per day and also provided his \"Enberg Moments\". At Wimbledon in 2004, he participated in a new one-hour morning show called \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\". ESPN asked CBS for permission to use Enberg during the summer of 2004 at both the French Open and Wimbledon. Enberg then surprised his new bosses by volunteering for the 2005 Australian Open in January 2005. \"I've never been to Australia,\" he said. \"At my age then [69], to be able to work a full Grand Slam is something I'd like to have at the back of my book.\" Enberg stopped calling the French Open after 2009 due to his Padres commitments, though he continued to call the Wimbledon and Australian Open tournaments over the next two years. In June 2011, it was reported that his ESPN contract had ended and that the 2011 Wimbledon tournament would be his final one for the network.\nJimmy Connors did commentary with NBC-TV in 1990 and 1991, during its coverage of the French Open and Wimbledon tournaments. During the Wimbledon tournaments of 2005, 2006, and 2007, Connors commentated for the BBC alongside John McEnroe (among others), providing moments of heated discussion between two former archrivals. Connors returned to BBC commentary at Wimbledon in 2014. Connors has also served as a commentator and analyst for the Tennis Channel since the US Open tournament of 2009.\nMary Carillo worked as both a host and analyst on HBO's Wimbledon coverage from 1996 to 1999, and on Turner Sports' coverage of Wimbledon from 2000 to 2002. In May 2003, Carillo joined NBC Sports as an analyst on the network's French Open and Wimbledon coverage, having made her debut as an analyst on NBC for the 1996 Family Circle Cup tennis event. Carillo's candid and insightful commentary has earned her accolades throughout the industry, including the distinction of being called \"the sport's top analyst\" by \"Sports Illustrated\". She is known for her deep voice, quick wit and pointed sense of humor. Like her long-time friend and fellow Douglaston, Queens, New York native John McEnroe, Carillo is known for her colorful turns of speech, and is credited with coining the phrase \"Big Babe Tennis\" to describe the era in women's tennis dominated by large, powerful players such as Lindsay Davenport, Serena Williams and Venus Williams. Carillo's unabashed and opinionated style of tennis commentary has drawn criticism from several top players, notably Andre Agassi, Serena and Venus Williams, and Maria Sharapova. Nevertheless, she has been named Best Commentator by \"Tennis Magazine\" (1988–91), Best Commentator by \"World Tennis\" magazine (1986) and Broadcaster of the Year by the Women's Tennis Association (1981 and 1985)."

        "text": "The 2020 Diamond League was the eleventh season of the annual series of outdoor track and field meetings, organised by World Athletics. The competition marked the first major revision to the top level athletics series since its foundation in 2010. The number of Diamond Discipline events was reduced from 32 to 24, and the dual-meet final format was due to be replaced by a single final, which would have expanded the number of meetings to 15. A second Chinese meeting was added to the calendar. The reduction of events was aimed at allowing a standardised 90-minute television format for the series. Each meeting will host 11 or 12 Diamond Discipline events and some of these events will not be broadcast. Events losing Diamond Discipline status will feature on the World Athletics Continental Tour, which will replace the IAAF World Challenge as the second tier of track and field meetings.\nCompared with the previous year, the Birmingham meeting moved venues to Gateshead due to stadium renovations, while the Prefontaine Classic was due to return to Eugene, Oregon following completion of its renovation. The Doha Diamond League will also return to the Qatar Sports Club, the home of the Qatari Diamond League between 2010 and 2018. The Golden Gala was originally due be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples instead of Rome, due to the renovation of the Olympic Stadium. Initial plans for the 2020 season were to remove the Stockholm Bauhaus Athletics from the series and condense the calendar into a much shorter time-frame, but these plans were abandoned after a five-year title sponsorship deal with Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group.\nDue to then ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the format was changed. The series will no longer be a structured series of events leading up to a final and athletes will not earn Diamond League points.\nSchedule.\nThe following nine meetings are scheduled to be included in the 2020 season (note: schedule was revised due to the pandemic and meetings in London, Eugene, Paris, Rabat, Gateshead and Shanghai were cancelled:\n() = Event was modified to no-spectator multi-place interactive event."

        "text": "The individual show jumping or \"Prix des Nations\" at the 1952 Summer Olympics took place on 3 August, at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. It was the ninth appearance of the event. For the first time, the event featured two rounds. There were 51 competitors from 20 nations, with each nation able to send a team of up to three riders with the results shared between team and individual events. The event was won by Pierre Jonquères d'Oriola of France, the nation's first victory in individual jumping since 1912 and second overall (the first nation to win a second gold medal in the event; the previous eight editions were all won by riders of different nationalities). Óscar Cristi of Chile took silver for that nation's first medal in the event. German rider Fritz Thiedemann earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nThree of the top 12 riders from the 1948 competition returned: gold medalist Humberto Mariles of Mexico, fifth-place finisher Jaime García of Spain, and seventh-place finisher Harry Llewellyn of Great Britain.\nEgypt, South Korea, and the Soviet Union each made their debut in the event. France and Sweden both competed for the eighth time, tied for the most of any nation; Sweden had missed only the inaugural 1900 competition, while France missed the individual jumping in 1932.\nCompetition format.\nThe team and individual jumping competitions used the same results. The course was 786 metres long with 13 obstacles, including a triple jump obstacle (fence, water jump, horizontal wall). The time limit was 1 minute, 57.2 seconds (400 m/min). Penalty points were received for obstacle faults (3, 4, 6, or 8 points based on severity) or exceeding the time limit (0.25 points per second or fraction thereof over the limit). A third refusal or jumping an obstacle out of order resulted in elimination. Scores from the two runs were added together for a total score.\nResults.\nA five-way tie for first resulted in a need for a barrage.\nThe five-way tie for first was resolved through a jump-off barrage. The course for the jump-off featured 6 obstacles. The same faults scoring was used. No time penalties were awarded, but the fastest time broke ties (based on faults) within the jump-off."

        "text": "John Hill Westbrook (November 13, 1947 – December 17, 1983) was a pastor and the first African American athlete to play in the Southwest Conference of American football during his time as a student at Baylor University.\nEarly life and education.\nWestbrook was born in Groesbeck, Texas to Robert and Etta Mae (née McCracken) Westbrook. Robert Westbrook was a pastor at several churches over the years, including Mt. Moriah Baptist Church in Elgin, Texas. John was ordained as a preacher when he was 15, maintaining a tradition in his family going back four generations. He attended high school in Elgin, where he participated in multiple sports, including basketball and football, and was salutatorian of his class. John's older brother, Robert Jr., was a star running back in high school.\nIn 1965, he started college at Baylor University, joining the football team as a running back. He faced racist treatment from some teammates and coaches. At the time, very few African American students attended Baylor, and none had received a football scholarship. Nonetheless, Westbrook was awarded an athletic scholarship before his sophomore year. Head coach John Bridgers made the decision to have Westbrook play during the 1966 season-opening game against Syracuse University. On September 10, 1966, Westbrook took to field during the fourth quarter of the nationally televised game, becoming the first African American to play in the Southwest Conference. He played in several subsequent games that season, but due to a knee injury sustained during a game against Texas Christian University, his participation on the team was limited for the remainder of his time at Baylor. He graduated from Baylor with a degree in English and religion in 1969 and earned his master's degree in English from Southwest Missouri State University.\nCareer and later life.\nWestbrook worked for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes in Kansas City before working in Nashville for the Southern Baptist Convention as a consultant on interracial issues. He was an athletic academic adviser at Florida State University and was a part-time English instructor at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas. He later served as pastor at True Vine Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Houston. He was on the board of directors for the Association of Blacks in Higher Education and was on the Texas State Urban League Council. In 1978, he sought the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Texas, but garnered only 23% of the vote, losing to William Hobby.\nWestbrook married Paulette White, a native of Houston, in 1968. The couple had four children: Elicia, Kirsten, John Jr., and Elizabeth.\nWestbrook died in 1983 from a pulmonary embolism at the age of 36. The funeral was held at Mt. Sinai Baptist Church in Houston, where the number of attendees exceeded the capacity of the church. Houston mayor Kathy Whitmire and Texas governor Mark White were in attendance.\nLegacy.\nIn 2009, Baylor athletics established the John Westbrook Award for Courage and Perseverance. The annual award is presented to Baylor student-athletes (one male, one female) who have overcome various challenges to become successful and make positive contributions to their teams and communities. In 2016, 50 years after Westbrook played in the historic game against Syracuse, he was honored during a home game at Baylor. His family accepted the honor on his behalf."

        "title": "1984–85 RPI Engineers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1984–85 RPI Engineers men's ice hockey team represented the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in college ice hockey. In its 6th year under head coach Mike Addesa the team compiled a 35–2–1 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the sixth time. The Engineers defeated Providence 2–1 to win the championship game at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan.\nSeason.\nNew ECAC.\nAfter a year in which Rensselaer set a new program record with 32 wins and reached the NCAA tournament for the first time in 20 years, RPI found themselves scrambling to adjust their schedule. All Six teams from the East Region of ECAC Hockey, along with newly admitted Lowell, broke away to from a new conference. While many of the higher-profile programs left, the reduction to 12 teams allowed the remaining ECAC members to play an even schedule for the first time in league history; all teams played one another twice, once at home and one on the road, except for Army who only played other ECAC members once. As part of the new scheduling arrangement, Rensselaer was paired with Vermont and the two teams would travel at the same time to visit the same region. For example, RPI's first conference road game was against Yale in Connecticut while at the same time Vermont played Brown in Rhode Island. The next night Rensselaer and Vermont swapped opponents which allowed all teams to reduce travel time while still fulfilling their new scheduling guidelines.\nEarly season hiccup.\nThe Engineers began the season with two strong home wins against Canadian teams but then immediately stumbled against St. Lawrence in their conference opener. The team recovered with a win over Clarkson the following night then hit the road for a set of games against North Dakota. RPI returned to the northeast after another weekend split and was able to finally win a weekend after getting a tough fight from Brown. Rensselaer ended the first part of their season with a fairly easy pair of games where they seemed to find the consistency that had served them well the year before.\nHoliday Tournament.\nFor the 34th annual Rensselaer Holiday Tournament, RPI dominated Miami in the semifinal before facing their third Canadian team of the season and managed to down Toronto in the final to take their third consecutive tournament title. When the team returned to its regular schedule the following weekend they fought a series of close games, including a surprising strong effort from Division III Union, but RPI escaped an embarrassing fate to raise their record to 13–2.\nECAC dominance.\nAfter that scare the Engineers didn't have another close game for almost two months, winning every game by at least 3 goals until their final game of the regular season, a 5–4 win over Cornell. After opening their conference schedule with a loss Rensselaer had won its final 20 conference games, the second best streak and the second most wins in conference history (both behind only 1970 Cornell) and the third highest winning percentage in ECAC history. Leading the way for the conference's top offense was junior center Adam Oates who had already set a new program record with 83 points the previous season and was well on his way to improving on the mark. RPI also possessed the #2 defense in the country, allowing only 54 goals in 21 conference games and were backstopped by Buffalo Sabres draft pick Daren Puppa.\nECAC tournament.\nSearching for their second consecutive ECAC crown, Rensselaer ran through Princeton in the quarterfinal series and then headed to Boston where Puppa stifled the opposition, allowing only one goal in each of the final two games which the Engineers ended triumphantly. Puppa was named as tournament MOP and with their 32–2 record Rensselaer received the #1 eastern seed to go along with their automatic tournament berth.\nNCAA tournament.\nWith the higher seed, Rensselaer played host to Lake Superior State in the Quarterfinals and opened by setting a new franchise record, with their 33rd win of the season, taking the contest 7–3. Because the Quarterfinal series was a total goal affair RPI would advance so long as could keep the second game close and a 3-3 tie was well within their margin for error. Because the Lakers could not win the series regardless of an overtime result no extra time was played and the game ended after regulation along with RPI's 30-game winning streak.\nRensselear headed to Detroit for the Frozen Four and met the previous season's runner-up, Minnesota–Duluth. In what became one of the more memorable games RPI and Duluth began fighting one another almost from the drop of the puck; the two teams got into a scrape then ended up with double matching minors and both teams played 3-on-3. during that time the Engineers opened the scoring with Tim Friday's fifth goal of the season. Afterwards RPI got into trouble with two consecutive penalties to give UMD a 5-on-3 advantage but their defense was able to hold the fort and prevent the Bulldogs from evening the score.\nIn the second period Mark Baron scored twice in 30 seconds to give the Bulldogs their first lead of the game. John Carter tied the game with a power play goal off a rebound before George Servinis gave the lead back to Rensselaer. The game was then tied for the fourth time when Brett Hull scored a breakaway goal and the two teams headed into intermission.\nIn the third, while killing a penalty, Servinis found himself on a partial breakaway but the puck got too far in front of him. Duluth goalie Rick Kosti charged out of the net to knock the puck away but Servinis reached it first and deflected the puck just enough for Kosti to miss it with his stick. Kosti's momentum carried him into Servinis but the RPI forward was able to stay on his skates, the same could not be said for Duluth defender Jim Johnson who went tumbling head over heels into the boards and allowed Servinis to shoot the puck into the vacated net. Duluth tied the game again when 1985 Hobey Baker Award winner Bill Watson shot his own rebound in behind Puppa. UMD's second lead of the game came from a Bob Herzig shot in the high slot that went under Puppa's glove. With regulation winding down and their chances dwindling, RPI fought to keep the puck alive in the Duluth end and, after a pass from behind the net, the puck pinballed off a Duluth skate right to Ken Hammond who slid the puck into the net.\nThe two teams continued to battle for the first two 10-minute overtimes but at the end of the second tempers flared and the teams ended up with a slew of penalties. The third overtime period began 3-on-3 and after two minutes the teams played 4-on-4, but because Duluth had taken one additional penalty, the Engineers found themselves on a power play from a penalty that had happened 4 minutes earlier. The Bulldogs were able to survive most of the disadvantage but with only 15 seconds left in the penalty Carter fired a shot from the point that deflected off a Duluth stick and into the net, ending the game that saw RPI setting a new Frozen Four record with 16 penalties (followed closely by Duluth's 14).\nChampionship.\nRensselaer made their first championship appearance in 31 years with only Providence standing in their way. The Friars were coming off their own triple overtime victory in the semifinal but had an extra day to recover from the exertion. The extra playing time didn't seem to faze the Engineers, however, as RPI opened the scoring with a power play goal less than 5 minutes into the game. Rensselaer dominated the play but couldn't get the puck past Chris Terreri on any of their other 13 shots of the period and had to settle for a 1–0 lead after 20 minutes. It was more of the same in the second period but, after giving Providence a brief 5-on-3 advantage, George Servinis scored his second short-handed goal of the Frozen Four at the tail-end of the second penalty to give the Engineers a two-goal cushion. After that Terreri stood on his head and turned aside every RPI shot that came his way. Even with a 2–0 lead Rensselaer looked to be overpowering the Friars, leading in the shot total 31 to 12 after 40 minutes. Providence responded in the third, firing 10 shots at Puppa with Paul Cavallini finding the twine on the power play, but it was too little too late and when the final horn sounded RPI had won their second national title.\nAwards and honors.\nUnsurprisingly Chris Terreri was given the tournament MOP, the last player to do so who did not play for the championship team, but four Engineers did make the All-Tournament team: Tim Friday, Ken Hammond, Adam Oates and George Servinis. Oates finished the season third in the nation in scoring with 91 points and first in points per game (2.39), narrowly outpacing Bill Watson's 2.36 ppg mark. Oates' scoring prowess earned him a spot on the AHCA All-American East First Team along with Hammond while John Carter made the Second Team. All three made the All-ECAC First Team while Daren Puppa, despite finishing second in the nation with 30 wins and third with a 2.56 goals against average received no further mention beyond tournament MOP.\nWhile the national championship in itself was the main goal for the Engineers, the fact that they won against one of the Hockey East teams that had broken away from ECAC Hockey over the previous summer probably made the victory just that much sweeter.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nPlayers drafted into the NHL.\n1985 NHL Entry Draft.\nAdam Oates, undrafted by his 22nd birthday, was able to sign a professional contract after forgoing his final year of eligibility. The $1.1 million deal he inked with Detroit was the most lucrative contract for a rookie at the time and the arms race for Oates' services led directly to the NHL instituting the Supplemental Draft. The secondary draft was used for players who were otherwise ineligible for the standard NHL Entry Draft."

        "text": "The 2023 ICC Under-19 Women's T20 World Cup was the first edition of the Under-19 Women's T20 World Cup, hosted by South Africa in 2023. The tournament was moved from its original slot at the end of 2021 to January 2023 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixteen teams competed in the tournament, initially divided into four groups.\nIndia, England, Australia and New Zealand progressed to the semi-finals of the competition. In the semi-finals, India beat New Zealand by 8 wickets and England beat Australia by 3 runs. The final took place on 29 January 2023 at Senwes Park, Potchefstroom, and saw India beat England by 7 wickets to become the inaugural champions of the ICC Under-19 Women's T20 World Cup.\nBackground.\nOriginally, the tournament was scheduled to take place in January 2021, before being moved back to December 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2020, the ICC looked at the possibility of deferring the tournament from its scheduled slot of January 2021 to later in the year. In January 2021, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) confirmed that they would host the tournament in December 2021, however the tournament was postponed for a second time, and was moved to January 2023. In January 2022, Geoff Allardice, the CEO of the ICC said that the tournament was \"very much on the cards\", and that the ICC were starting the process for hosts.\nQualification.\nIn June 2022, the ICC confirmed the qualification process for the tournament. Hosts South Africa, along with Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, West Indies and Zimbabwe all qualified automatically for the tournament. The United States also qualified automatically, as they were the only eligible team to compete from the Americas regional group. The four remaining places will come from regional qualification groups. The United Arab Emirates were the first team to qualify from the regional groups, after they won the Asia Qualifier. Indonesia won their three-match series against Papua New Guinea to win the East Asia-Pacific group to qualify. It was the first time that Indonesia had qualified for an ICC World Cup tournament at any level. Rwanda won the African Qualifiers to qualify for the World Cup. It was for the first time that Rwanda had qualified for an ICC World Cup tournament at any level. This is also the first ICC Women's World Cup for Scotland, United Arab Emirates, United States, and Zimbabwe at any level.\nCompetition format.\nThe 16 teams were divided into four groups of four, and play once against each other side in their group. The top three teams in each group progressed to the Super Six League stage, where qualifying teams from Group A played against two of the qualifying teams from Group D, and qualifying teams from Group B played against two of the qualifying teams from Group C. Points from matches against teams that also qualified from the first group stage were carried forward into the Super Six League stage. The top two sides from each of the Super Six Leagues progressed to the semi-finals, with the final taking place on 29 January 2023.\nSquads.\nEach team could select a squad of fifteen players for the tournament, with additional non-travelling reserves also able to be named. England were the first side to name their squad, doing so on 18 October 2022.\nMatch officials.\nOn 5 January 2023, ICC announced the names of fifteen match officials for the tournament, of whom nine were women – making it the highest number of female match officials to be appointed for any ICC event.\nWarm-up matches.\nThe following warm-up matches were played before the tournament's official start:\nGroup stage.\nGroup A.\n Advanced to Super 6\nGroup B.\n Advanced to Super 6\nGroup C.\n Advanced to Super 6\nGroup D.\n(H) Host &lt;br&gt; \n Advanced to Super 6\nSuper 6.\nSuper 6 Group 1.\n(H) Host &lt;br&gt; \n Advanced to Knockout Stage\nSuper 6 Group 2.\n Advanced to Knockout Stage\nStatistics.\nTeam of the tournament.\nOn 30 January 2023, the ICC announced the Team of the Tournament.

The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, with the tour took place straight after New Zealand's tour of the Netherlands.\nOriginally the tour was scheduled to take place in July 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic put the tour in doubt. In April 2020, David White, Chief Executive of New Zealand Cricket, said that the tour would be \"most unlikely\" to happen. However, the tour was postponed after the fixtures clashed with the West Indies rescheduled tour to England. The full details of the rescheduled tour were confirmed on 1 June 2022.\nSquads.\nOn 13 August, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) announced that Matt Henry was ruled out of the tour due to rib injury, and was replaced by Ben Sears. Shimron Hetmyer, Gudakesh Motie and Keemo Paul all were ruled out of the ODI series due to different reasons, forcing Cricket West Indies (CWI) to add Jermaine Blackwood and Yannic Cariah to the West Indies' ODI squad.

The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. The fixtures for the tour were confirmed by Cricket West Indies in May 2021.\nSouth Africa won the first Test by an innings and 63 runs inside three days. South Africa won the second Test match by 158 runs to take the series 2–0.\nOn 29 June 2021, the South African players wore black armbands in remembrance of former South African team manager Goolam Rajah, and a one-minute's silence was observed prior to the start of play. South Africa's Tabraiz Shamsi dedicated the team's one-run victory over the West Indies as a tribute to Goolam. The West Indies won the fourth T20I match by 21 runs, to tie the series at 2–2 with one game to play. South Africa won the fifth T20I by 25 runs, winning the series 3–2.\nBackground.\nOriginally, the tour was scheduled to take place in July and August 2020. The first two T20I matches would have been played at the Central Broward Regional Park in Florida. The Test series would have formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. However, the series was later postponed, as the West Indies toured England at the same time, after those fixtures were rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn July 2020, Johnny Grave, chief executive of Cricket West Indies, suggested that the series could take place in September 2020. Also in July 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed it was their priority to reschedule the matches, along with the five other World Test Championship series that had been postponed due to the pandemic. On 1 August 2020, Graeme Smith confirmed that the tour had been postponed indefinitely, due to schedule clashes with the 2020 Caribbean Premier League and the 2020 Indian Premier League. In April 2021, it was reported that the tour would be taking place in June 2021, but this was initially thrown into further doubt when Cricket South Africa was threatened with \"defunding\" and \"derecognising\" by Nathi Mthethwa, South Africa's Minister of Arts and Culture. However, after sanctions were not imposed on Cricket South Africa, the tour dates were confirmed in May 2021.\nSquads.\nOn 18 May 2021, Cricket West Indies (CWI) named a 18-man provisional squad for the T20I matches, with Kieron Pollard captaining the team. On 4 June 2021, CWI named a 17-man provisional squad for the Test matches, with Kraigg Brathwaite named as the team's captain. Ahead of the second Test, CWI recalled Darren Bravo and Shannon Gabriel for the match, with Nkrumah Bonner being unavailable due to suffering with a concussion in the first Test. Ahead of the T20I series, Dwaine Pretorius tested positive for COVID-19 and was replaced in South Africa's squad by Wiaan Mulder. Beuran Hendricks was also added to South Africa's T20I squad. Ahead of the third T20I, Shimron Hetmyer was added to the West Indies' squad, and Akeal Hosein was added to their squad ahead of the fourth T20I. For the fifth T20I, Sheldon Cottrell replaced Fabian Allen in the West Indies' squad."

        "title": "List of American Basketball Association broadcasters",
        "text": "In early-1970s, the CBS television network aired American Basketball Association (ABA) games, specifically league's annual All-Star Game/selected playoff games. Pat Summerall served as the CBS analyst on some ABA games alongside Don Criqui on play-by-play. Game 5 of the 1970 ABA Finals (Indiana vs. Los Angeles) was nationally televised by CBS on Saturday, May 23 at 3 p.m Eastern Time. The broadcast was however, blacked out in Indiana. After that league's 1972-73 season, CBS lost its TV airing rights as they started airing National Basketball Association (NBA) games in its 1973-74 season onward.\nHad there been a seventh game of the 1975-76 season's championship playoff series it would've been televised by NBC, because that network signed contract to a potential seventh game on Sunday, May 16, 1976. Since the ABA Finals ultimately ended in six games, with the New York Nets triumphing over the Denver Nuggets in what would become the ABA's final game of its nine year existence, NBC's contract was void. \n1960s.\n1969–70.\nDuring the New York Nets ABA years, announcers included Marty Glickman, Marv Albert's brothers Al Albert and Steve Albert, baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson, Bob Goldsholl, as well as John Sterling and Mike DiTomasso. The latter two joined the club's move into the NBA.\n1970s.\n1975-76.\nDuring the mid-1970s, HBO aired several basketball games from the National Basketball Association and the American Basketball Association (notably, the last ABA Finals game in 1976, prior to the latter league's merger with the NBA, between the New York Nets and the Denver Nuggets).\nIn 1976, CBS sought to establish a postseason playoff between the ABA and NBA, and to win the rights to broadcast those games.\nDuring the 1976–77 season, the NBA's first after the ABA–NBA merger brought the American Basketball Association into the league, CBS held a slam dunk contest that ran during halftime of the \"Game of the Week\" telecasts. Don Criqui was the host of this particular competition. The final, which pitted Larry McNeill of the Golden State Warriors against eventual winner Darnell \"Dr. Dunk\" Hillman of the Indiana Pacers, took place during Game 6 of the 1977 NBA Finals. At the time of the final, Hillman's rights had been traded to the New York Nets, but he had not yet signed a contract. Since he was not officially a member of any NBA team, instead of wearing a jersey, he competed in a plain white tank top. Then for the post-competition interview, Hillman donned a shirt with the words \"Bottle Shoppe\" – the name of an Indianapolis liquor store, which is still in existence, and was the sponsor of a city parks softball league team for which Hillman played left field (and the only team he was a member of at the time). Other players to compete in the slam dunk tournament included Julius Erving, George Gervin, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Moses Malone. CBS, anxious for star power, also gave David Thompson the opportunity to be eliminated three times."

        "title": "1930 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1930 season of Auckland Rugby League was its 22nd. It was generally regarded that the season was very disappointing in terms of the quality of the football played and much of the blame was put down to the fact that too many teams were in the Senior A Grade and there was too much talent spread through the Senior B teams which in turn diluted the top division. There had been a noticeable drop in the attendances at matches at Carlaw Park which had seen 8 to 10 thousand regularly attending club matches. A review of the season was published in \"The New Zealand Herald\" on 22 October discussing the issue.\nThe Senior A championship was won by Ponsonby United for the second consecutive year which was their fifth title overall. They were awarded the Monteith Shield. This was the last year that the Monteith Shield was played for as the man this trophy was named after suggested that the main championship trophy should be one named in honour of Mr. Edwin Vincent Fox who had died earlier that year. Ponsonby also won the Roope Rooster trophy for the sixth time after defeating Richmond Rovers by 15 points to 7 in the final. Ponsonby were however beaten by Devonport United in the final of the Stormont Shield 17–5. This was the first time Devonport had won the Stormont Shield. A week later on 11 October Ponsonby played the champions of the South Auckland competition who were Ngaruawahia in the first match of its kind. Ponsonby won 32 to 29.\nThe Senior B championship was won by Otahuhu who beat the 1929 champions Point Chevalier in the final by 3 points to 0. The Stallard Cup knockout competition for Senior B teams was won by Richmond who defeated Point Chevalier 21–11 in the final. Richmond were the first club to enter a B team (effectively a reserve grade team) in this grade, and for the Stallard Cup they were joined by a B team from Devonport.\n \nSeason News.\nClub teams by grade participation.\nIn a major scandal following the Stormont Shield match between Ponsonby United and Devonport, Frank Delgrosso, the Auckland and New Zealand representative who was captain of the Ponsonby team was suspended for three seasons. Delgrosso was charged with misconduct along with another Ponsonby player V. Goodwin. They were also barred from attending Carlaw Park in the future. He failed to make a teammate who had been ordered off to leave the field, threw mud at the referee, and abused him.\nMt Albert was a new addition to the B Grade competition by entering a team there for the first time. This was their first senior grade team. They had won the Second Grade competition the previous year and were essentially ‘promoting’ the team.\nThe Auckland Rugby League placed a tender for its “Auckland Rugby League Programme and Gazette” for the 1930 season.\nPrior to the season opening games the Auckland Star ran a piece on the prospects of each A Grade team and the players it had acquired.\nAs the season progressed much talk was made about the standard of the Senior A Grade and its inability to field enough sides of quality. The decision was eventually made to reduce the number of A Grade sides to 6 and to do away with the Senior B competition altogether for the following season. Instead the league would encourage good quality players to move from those sides to clubs with A Grade teams. A special committee was formed to suggest a way forward. They decided to recommend that the six teams to make up the A Grade for the 1931 season should be Ponsonby, Marist, Devonport, Metropolitan (to include City and Newton), Western Suburbs or Richmond, and Eastern Suburbs (to include Ellerslie). There was much discussion of the matter by members of various clubs over which clubs should merge or who disagreed that their club should disappear. The matter was further discussed in a Management Committee meeting on 15 October but a decision was deferred for a week.\nOn 29 October it was decided by the Auckland Rugby League to officially reduce the number of teams in the Senior A Grade to 6. The clubs would be known as Ponsonby United, Devonport, Marist Old Boys, Western Suburbs (Richmond Rovers and Kingsland), Metropolitan (City and Newton), and Eastern Suburbs (Ellerslie and the surrounding district). This was not to be the only time that Auckland Rugby League went down the path of making teams, who were often unwilling, into mergers. It happened again decades later before reverting to the norm, and then again in the 1990s before once again reverting to the norm with standalone clubs. Clubs who were particularly against the proposal were City Rovers, Newton Rangers, Kingsland Athletic, and Richmond.\nPapakura hosted its first ever rugby league match when Richmond 2nd Grade and Newmarket 2nd Grade played there at the end of the season. Richmond won 20–10.\nObituaries.\nEdward Vincent Fox\nOn 24 February Mr. Edward Vincent Fox died. He was a member of the Devonport team before World War I and played inside five-eighths for Auckland against England. In 1913 he enlisted in the war efforts and fought in the front lines. He was shot in the leg and when he returned to Auckland was unable to play again. He was appointed to the executive of Auckland Rugby League and was a selector for the Auckland and New Zealand teams. He was buried at O’Neill's Point Cemetery on the North Shore, New Zealand.\nMonteith Shield (first grade championship).\nMonteith Shield fixtures.\nRound 1.\n Marist Old Boys victory over Kingsland Athletic was contested by Kingsland over an unregistered player (Munro) playing in the match. The protest was upheld and Kingsland were awarded the match. Marist Old Boys appealed to the New Zealand League Council but the decision was upheld by that body also. In the Round 1 match Craddock Dufty was ordered from the field for allegedly disputing a referees decision on a possible forward pass which led to the tying City Rovers try near the end of the match.\nRound 3.\nGovernor General Lord Bledisloe attended the Carlaw Park matches and was photographed with Ben Davidson of City rovers before the kickoff. Frank Delgrosso left the field early in the match for Ponsonby with an injured knee. In the second half Goodwin, Riley and Cyril Thompson all left the field injured and were not able to be replaced owing to the non-replacement rule which applied to the second half of matches. Goodwin was treated in hospital for concussion.\nRound 4.\nIn the match between Marist and City, Bernard Sweeney was ordered off for Marist and Mita Watene was ordered off for City. Frank Delgrosso against left the field after injuring his knee while playing for Ponsonby.\nRound 6.\nTed Brimble made his debut for Newton Rangers after switching from the Manukau rugby club and joining his brother Cyril who was in his second season for Newton. At the end of the season Cyril was granted a transfer to Canterbury where he would play rugby league representatively.\nRound 7.\nThe match between Ponsonby and Kingsland was played at the Mangere Domain.\nRound 8.\nThe Marist v Kingsland match finished with an unusual scoreline of 0-0. Although the score was perhaps somewhat misleading as Marist Old Boys played two men short for most of the game with Batchelor and Norm Campbell going off injured in the first half. One of the only other times that this had happened since the first round of matches in 1910 when North Shore drew 0–0 with Newton.\nRound 10.\nFor Marist, Phil Brady was sent off for punching an Ellerslie player early in the second half. Bert Laing after an absence of 3 years turned out for Devonport.\nRound 12.\nThe Round 12 matches due to be played on 9 August were all postponed after rain fell on the Saturday. This added to the rain which had fallen throughout the week leading up to the Saturday.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nCraddock Dufty, who had returned from the recent New Zealand tour to Australia refused to play in the fixture against the Auckland players citing an injured elbow. He did not produce a doctors certificate and as a result Auckland Rugby League suspended him and he was unable to play for Ellerslie in their first round match. Jim O'Brien was sent off after a \"verbal altercation\" with referee Vic Simpson. This was to be his last official competition match of his career, though he did play in the McManus benefit match weeks later at Otahuhu.\nStormont Shield.\nCity and Devonport were tied for second place in the Senior A competition and as Ponsonby won both the Senior A championship and the Roope Rooster it left City and Devonport to play off for the right to join them in the Stormont Shield match. Devonport defeated City by 1 point to earn the right to play Ponsonby. In the final Ponsonby had J. Moore ordered off but he refused to leave. The referee then left the field until Moore was persuaded to leave and the game could progress. Moore was later suspended by the league. It eventually turned out that the Auckland and New Zealand representative Frank Delgrosso who was captain at the time had failed to persuade Moore to leave the field and had also verbally abused the referee and thrown mud at him. Delgrosso was suspended by the league for three years but on appeal and with an apology and expression of regret at a March 1931 meeting his suspension was reduced.\nProvincial club championship.\nA game between the champions of the Auckland and South Auckland competitions Ponsonby and Ngaruawahia. George Tittleton fractured his collarbone after being thrown heavily near the end of the match. He finished the game but was taken to Auckland Hospital straight after the match. L Stevens, the Ponsonby hooker received a head injury which required stitches. \nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nTop try and point scorers for A Grade and Roope Rooster matches. Les O'Leary of Devonport United top scored with 72 points followed by Frank Delgrosso with 59, and Ted Mincham with 56. George Batchelor of Marist Old Boys was the top try scorer with 15, followed by Leonard Riley and George Perry with 12 each.\nSenior B grade competition.\nSenior B grade standings.\nA Māngere United and Mt Albert result is missing as it was not reported in any of the newspapers of the time.\nSenior B grade fixtures.\nMt Albert entered a senior team for the first time in their club history which had begun in 1928.\nThe Round 8 game between Māngere and Richmond B was not played because a charity match between Ponsonby and Kingsland was being played on its ground.\nParnell were referred to as the “magpies” on account of their black and white uniforms by the Auckland Star after their Round 9 match.\nThe Round 9 match report in the Auckland Star incorrectly reported the score 15–6 in favour of Northcote, however they corrected it in their following week reports of the Senior B matches as being a 15–6 win to Mangere.\nThe round 13 matches were cancelled due to steady rain falling on the Saturday adding to significant rain that had fallen during the week, aside from the game at Māngere. The Northcote v Otahuhu match was postponed as Northcote had played their traditional fixture v Huntly on Northcote's home ground at Stafford Park.\nOtahuhu beat Point Chevalier in the final by 3 points to 0 to win the Senior B championship.\nStallard Cup knockout competition.\nDevonport entered a Senior B team in the Stallard Cup which had not played in the Senior B grade during the season. This team could loosely be considered the second ever ‘reserve’ grade team fielded following the Richmond clubs entry of Senior B teams in that grade for the 1929 and 1930 seasons.\nOther club matches and lower grades.\nLower grade competitions.\nThe Sixth grade had in previous years been split into A and B grades however in 1930 the Sixth Grade B competition was reclassified as the Seventh Grade.\nSecond grade.\nRichmond won the championship. The team had been together for 6 seasons and won every single championship as they progressed through the grades. Ponsonby United won the knock out competition on September 13 when they beat Devonport by default. There were several games without results reported however the newspapers published the final standings so they are accurate.\nThird Open Grade standings.\nPonsonby won the championship undefeated winning all 14 matches. They also won the knockout competition when they beat Marist in the final on September 13 by 10 points to 3.\nThird Intermediate Grade standings.\nKingsland Athletic won the championship. Newmarket won the knockout competition when they defeated Akarana/Parnell 8-2 in the final on September 13. The Parnell/Akarana side had knocked out Kingsland in the semi-finals 8 points to 0, while Newmarket had defeated Takapuna in the other. A club had formed at Takapuna in June and they entered a team in the competition to play teams on their bye. They performed well winning all 3 of their matches. \nFourth Grade standings.\nRichmond won the championship and the knockout competition. They were coached by James Francis who died at Auckland Hospital on November 24 aged just 33 leaving behind a wife (Violet) and two children. He had played for the Newton Rangers senior side in the 1920s.\nFifth Grade standings.\nMarist won the championship with Otahuhu runner up. Marist also won the knockout competition when they beat Otahuhu in the final on September 20.\nSixth Grade standings.\nPoint Chevalier won the championship which was played over a 24 week period with 2 full rounds being played.\nSeventh Grade standings.\nRichmond A won the championship and the knockout competition when they beat Point Chevalier on September 20.\nPrimary schools standings.\nRichmond won the championship by beating Akarana (Parnell) 11–8 in the final on September 20. They also won the knockout competition when they beat Otahuhu A 6 to 3 in the final on October 18. \nThe competition had been split into two sections and then towards the end of the season a third was added as Ponsonby, Richmond B, and Otahuhu B entered sides, each only playing 5-6 games before the end of the season. However the standings are in one table as despite their being sections sides played teams from other sections each week. Some of the teams were from individual schools such as Avondale Public School, Avondale Convent School, and Onehunga Convent School, but the majority were from several schools in the area. The Ponsonby team represented 3 Ponsonby area schools for example. On October 18 Devonport and Northcote played each other in a friendly match with Devonport winning 10-8. At halftime a goal kicking competition took place with Devonport player Verdun Scott winning it with 16 points. He was presented with a cricket bat as the winning prize and ironically would go on to not only represent New Zealand at rugby league, but also at cricket, becoming the only dual New Zealand international in those two codes. On the same day Richmond beat Otahuhu 6-3 to win the Davis Cup Challenge match.\nOther club and junior representative matches.\nRichmond played a preseason match in Whangarei with a team made up of Whangarei city and Hikurangi players. The match was played on the new Cossill Park before a large crowd and the local team ran out comfortable winners.\nW McManus benefit match.\nAt the end of the season Otahuhu hosted a benefit match for W. McManus who was a well-known ex-amateur runner and league player who had been ill for a long time in hospital. The match was played between Otahuhu Senior B team and the Marist A side. Marist were not at full strength but still fielded a good side. Otahuhu won 26–25.\nWednesday Competition.\nIn July several businesses approached the Auckland Rugby League regarding the possibility of playing a competition between them on Wednesday's. The Auckland Rugby League agreed in August and the first matches were played on August 27. Initially there were ten teams set to enter however eventually just seven entered the competition and the Royal Billiard Saloon side failed to fulfill a fixture leaving 6 sides to compete.\nWednesday Competition fixtures.\nWhile there were many players with little or no experience some of the teams did feature senior grade players such as W. Skelton of Ponsonby who played for Private Taxis, and brothers F. and J. Herring who played for the Trotting Trainers. Alan Clarke also played in Private Taxi's first match, Stan Prentice played at least twice for the Trotting Trainers, and Ted Brimble played for New Zealand Fertilisers. Barmen won the competition winning 4 games and drawing one. \nWednesday Competition 'final game'.\nFollowing the awarding of the Barmen side the championship a match was scheduled between them and players from all of the other sides. The Barmen team won 8 to 7.\nRepresentative season.\nIt was a relatively quiet season for the Auckland representative side due to the fact that the New Zealand team toured Australia in the latter part of the year. They beat Northland, lost to South Auckland, and lost to the New Zealand touring team.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nInter-Island match.\nFor the North Island v South Island trial the Devonport and Ponsonby clubs gave permission for their jerseys to be worn by the respective sides. Mick O’Brien of the South Island team broke his tibia late in the match.\nAuckland v New Zealand.\nJames Jones came on as a replacement for an injured Puti Tipene Watene. Wilf Hassan came on as a replacement for Auckland."

        "text": "The men's pommel horse competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics was held at Earls Court Exhibition Centre on 12 and 13 August. It was the seventh appearance of the event. There were 121 competitors from 16 nations, with each nation sending a team of up to 8 gymnasts. The event ended in a three-way tie for the gold medal, with all three winners from Finland: Paavo Aaltonen, Veikko Huhtanen, and Heikki Savolainen. It was the third time the medals had been swept in the event (United States in 1904, Switzerland in 1924). Another three-way tie would occur in 1988. It was Finland's first victory in the event, and first medal since 1928.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). One of the top 10 gymnasts from 1936 returned: seventh-place finisher Michael Reusch of Switzerland. Reusch had won the 1938 world championship, the last before World War II; there had not yet been another since the war, so he was the reigning champion.\nArgentina, Cuba, Denmark, and Egypt each made their debut in the men's pommel horse. The United States made its sixth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format. Each nation entered a team of up to eight gymnasts (Cuba and Argentina had only 7; Mexico only 5). All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus, with the scores summed to give a final total. The scores in each of the six apparatus competitions were added together to give individual all-around scores; the top six individual scores on each team were summed to give a team all-around score. No separate finals were contested.\nFor each exercise, four judges gave scores from 0 to 10 in one-tenth point increments. The top and bottom scores were discarded and the remaining two scores summed to give the exercise total. If the two scores were sufficiently far apart, the judges would \"confer\" and decide on a score. Thus, exercise scores ranged from 0 to 20, apparatus scores from 0 to 40, individual totals from 0 to 240, and team scores from 0 to 1,440."

        "text": "The men's horizontal bar competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics was held at Earls Court Exhibition Centre on 12 and 13 August. It was the seventh appearance of the event. There were 121 competitors from 16 nations, with each nation sending a team of up to 8 gymnasts. The event was won by Josef Stalder of Switzerland, with his countryman Walter Lehmann taking silver. It was the nation's second victory in the event (after 1928), tying the United States for most all-time. Veikko Huhtanen of Finland earned bronze, giving Finland a three-Games podium streak in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Two of the top 10 gymnasts from 1936 returned: gold medalist Aleksanteri Saarvala and fifth-place finisher Heikki Savolainen of Finland. Savolainen was competing in his fourth Olympics; he had placed 13th in 1928 and won the silver medal in 1932. The reigning world champion, Michael Reusch of Switzerland, had won that title in 1938; he was still competing and a serious contender (taking gold in the parallel bars in London).\nArgentina, Cuba, Denmark, and Egypt each made their debut in the men's parallel bars. The United States made its sixth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format. Each nation entered a team of up to eight gymnasts (Cuba and Argentina had only 7; Mexico only 5). All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus, with the scores summed to give a final total. The scores in each of the six apparatus competitions were added together to give individual all-around scores; the top six individual scores on each team were summed to give a team all-around score. No separate finals were contested.\nFor each exercise, four judges gave scores from 0 to 10 in one-tenth point increments. The top and bottom scores were discarded and the remaining two scores summed to give the exercise total. If the two scores were sufficiently far apart, the judges would \"confer\" and decide on a score. Thus, exercise scores ranged from 0 to 20, apparatus scores from 0 to 40, individual totals from 0 to 240, and team scores from 0 to 1,440."

It was the first race of the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series season.\nThe race was started by President of the United States Donald Trump, who served as Grand Marshal, and the opening lap was paced by the official Presidential state car. WWE professional wrestler Sheamus drove the pace car for the opening laps, and Dale Earnhardt Jr., two-time winner of the Daytona 500, waved the green flag to officially start the race.\nThe race was scheduled for February 16, but persistent rain showers caused the race to be suspended on lap 20 and postponed until 4 p.m. the following day, the second time the race has had to be postponed due to rain. The first time was in 2012. This was the final Daytona 500 starts for Clint Bowyer, Reed Sorenson, Brendan Gaughan, Leavine Family Racing, Premium Motorsports, and Germain Racing.\nMost of the race was cleanly run until lap 185, when The Big One struck, triggering a massive crash involving at least 20 cars on the backstretch. The race was red-flagged as a result. Denny Hamlin won the race by 0.014 seconds over Ryan Blaney on the second restart in overtime after Blaney accidentally spun Ryan Newman into the outside wall coming to the finish line. Chris Buescher, David Ragan, and Kevin Harvick rounded out the top five. Newman was immediately rushed to a local hospital after the crash. Two hours after the crash, it was announced he was seriously injured in the crash, but the injuries were not believed to be life-threatening. Newman was released from the hospital on Wednesday, February 19, and would return to racing at the 2020 The Real Heroes 400. In the days that followed, many news outlets credit Newman's miraculous survival of his crash to the safety features implemented by NASCAR following the death of Dale Earnhardt at the end of the 2001 Daytona 500.\nReport.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida that is one of six superspeedways, the others being Auto Club Speedway, Pocono Raceway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Michigan International Speedway, and Talladega Superspeedway.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of three superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the other two being Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees.\nPractice.\nFirst practice (February 8).\nTy Dillon was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 44.206 seconds and a speed of .\nSecond practice (February 8).\nBubba Wallace was the fastest in the second practice session with a time of 45.878 seconds and a speed of .\nQualifying.\nRicky Stenhouse Jr. scored the pole for the race with a time of 46.253 seconds and a speed of .\nBluegreen Vacations Duel.\nThe Bluegreen Vacations Duels are a pair of NASCAR Cup Series races held in conjunction with the Daytona 500 annually in February at Daytona International Speedway. They consist of two races 60 laps and 150 miles (240 km) in length, which serve as heat races that set the lineup for the Daytona 500. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd-numbered positions on pole qualifying day, while the second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even-numbered positions. The Duels set the lineup for positions 3–38, while positions 39 and 40 are filled by the two \"Open\" (teams without a charter) cars that set the fastest times in qualifying, but did not lock in a spot in the Duels.\nFor championship purposes, each Duel is a full Championship Stage, except there is no playoff point awarded. The top ten drivers receive championship points.\nPractice (post–Duels).\nThird practice (February 14).\nWilliam Byron was the fastest in the third practice session with a time of 43.991 seconds and a speed of .\nFinal practice (February 15).\nJoey Logano was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 44.884 seconds and a speed of .\nRace.\nFinish.\nOn the second attempt at a green-white-checker finish, Chase Elliott spun just after the lead pack received the white flag, but the green flag stayed out and Denny Hamlin led Ryan Newman and Ryan Blaney through Turn One. Newman and Blaney teamed up to bump-draft past Hamlin down the backstretch but Hamlin managed to tuck in behind Blaney and bump-draft with him through Turns Three and Four. As the three leaders headed for the Tri-Oval and the checkered flag, a push from Hamlin got Blaney's car loose. Fighting for control, Blaney veered to the inside and Newman dove inside to block him. The two cars touched and Newman lost control. His car veered to the right and hit the outside wall head-on, then rolled upside-down and back into the middle of the track. Corey LaJoie's car slammed squarely into Newman's driver's-side window, launching the car into the air and over the start-finish line to finally come to rest near the exit of the pitlane upside-down, on fire and leaking fluid from its destroyed rear end. Meanwhile, the contact with Newman had slowed Blaney just enough to allow Hamlin to catch him at the line and win the race by 0.014 seconds.\nPost-race.\nIn the immediate post-race, Hamlin and his crew, unaware of the severity of Newman's crash, began celebrating his win and was subsequently booed heavily by the crowd upon exiting his car, both on the infield grass and again in victory lane. Joe Gibbs issued an apology for the team's celebration, with Hamlin saying he was first aware of the accident severity when NASCAR canceled the recent tradition of interviewing the winner on the front-stretch prior to the car being driven to victory lane.\nStage Results.\nStage One\n\"Laps:\" 65\nStage Two\n\"Laps:\" 65\nFinal Stage Results.\nStage Three\n\"Laps:\" 70\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince 2001—with the exception of 2002, 2004 and 2006—the Daytona 500 has been carried by Fox in the United States. The booth crew consists of longtime NASCAR lap-by-lap announcer Mike Joy and three–time Daytona 500 champion Jeff Gordon. Pit road is manned by Jamie Little, Regan Smith, Vince Welch, and Matt Yocum. 1992 and 1998 Daytona 500 winning crew chief Larry McReynolds and 2010 Daytona 500 winning driver Jamie McMurray provided insight from the Fox Sports studio in Charlotte.\nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the Motor Racing Network—who has covered the Daytona 500 since 1970—and simulcast on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. The booth crew consists of Alex Hayden, Jeff Striegle, and 1989 Cup Series champion Rusty Wallace. Longtime turn announcer Dave Moody is the lead turn announcer, calling the race from atop the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 2 when the field races through turns 1 and 2. Mike Bagley works the backstretch for the race from a spotter's stand on the inside of the track &amp; Kyle Rickey calls the race when the field races through turns 3 and 4 from the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 4. On pit road, MRN is manned by lead pit reporter and NASCAR Hall of Fame Executive Director Winston Kelley. He will be joined on pit road by Steve Post, Kim Coon, and Dillon Welch."

        "title": "2019 Breeders' Cup",
        "text": "The 2019 Breeders' Cup World Championships was the 36th edition of the premier event of the North American thoroughbred horse racing year. The 14 races, all but one of which were Grade I, took place on November 1 and 2 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. The races were telecast by NBCSN on Friday and early Saturday, and by NBC later on Saturday. \nThe Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North American racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December. The event typically determines champions in many of the Eclipse Award divisions.\nQualifying.\nA maximum of 14 horses (12 in the Turf Sprint and Juvenile Turf Sprint) are allowed to start in each race. Horses can automatically qualify by winning one of the designated races in the Breeders' Cup Challenge series, which provide \"Win and You're In\" berths in a specified division of the Breeders' Cup. Other pre-entries are ranked by a points system and the judgement of a panel of experts.\nOn October 21, pre-entries to the event were submitted for 188 horses, including 47 from overseas. During this stage, the connections of the horses indicated their intention to enter a specific race, and could also list a possible alternate. After assessing the potential competition, the connections made their final decision and paid the necessary entry fees on October 28. At that time, the field for each race was set, barring injury or other unforeseen circumstances.\nFifty of the pre-entries qualified automatically via the Breeders' Cup Challenge series. These included the two leading candidates for the Classic, McKinzie (Whitney Handicap) and Code of Honor (Jockey Club Gold Cup). Other highly ranked qualifiers included Bricks and Mortar (Arlington Million) in the Breeders' Cup Turf and Midnight Bisou (Ogden Phipps, Personal Ensign Stakes) in the Distaff, both undefeated in 2019 and considered leading candidates for Horse of the Year.\nEvent preparation.\nOn August 17, 2018, the Breeders' Cup organization announced that Santa Anita Park would host the event for a record tenth time. The track committed to over $5 million in improvements, including new suites on the upper level of the grandstand. The selection became controversial however when 30 horses died during Santa Anita's 2018-9 winter-spring meeting, raising concerns over the safety of the equine athletes. The management of Santa Anita undertook several changes, including extensive testing of the track surface and changes regarding pre-race medication. \"It's been an area of concern,\" said Chad Brown, Eclipse Award-winning trainer. \"But ultimately I didn't avoid running any horses in the Breeders' Cup due to this issue. I did have some questions from clients, but I feel confident Santa Anita management will make the track safe, and I agree with all the safeguards their management has put in.\"\nOut-of-competition testing for the event was also extensive, including the use of hair samples for the first time.\nExtensive wildfires in California, including the Getty Fire in western Los Angeles, did not affect the Breeders' Cup as they were all downwind from the facility. \nResults.\nSanta Anita took several actions to increase the safety of horses and jockeys, such as closing the downhill turf course after several horses had been injured while crossing over the main track. This meant that the turf sprint races were run at 5 furlongs instead of the normal furlongs. They also increased the number of veterinarians in attendance, which resulted in several scratches before racing began. Despite the precautions, Mongolian Groom was seriously injured during the running of the Classic and had to be euthanized.\nJockey Irad Ortiz Jr. won the Shoemaker Award as the leading jockey during the event. He rode four winners, including Bricks and Mortar in the $4 million Turf and Vino Rosso in the $6 million Classic.\nTrainer Chad Brown was the leading trainer of the event with three winners: Bricks and Mortar in the Turf, Uni in the Mile and Structor in the Juvenile Turf. This gave Brown 15 lifetime wins at the Breeders' Cup, tying him for second with Bob Baffert. D. Wayne Lukas has the all-time lead with 20 wins.\nFriday, November 1.\nThe on-track attendance was 41,243, down slightly from the Friday attendance in 2018 at Churchill Downs. However, all-source wagering was up 5.4%, to a record of $56,517,228.\nFor the second year in a row, all five Breeders' Cup races on \"Future Stars Friday\" were for two-year-olds. The day featured several upsets, most notably that of Storm the Court in the Juvenile at odds of 45-1. The favorite, Dennis' Moment, stumbled at the start and was never a factor, ultimately finishing last. Storm the Court took the early lead and turned back a late challenge from Anneau d'Or, another longshot.\nThe only favorite to win was Four Wheel Drive in the Juvenile Turf Sprint. Four Wheel Drive is from the first crop of horses sired by Grand Slam winner American Pharoah.\nAn asterisk after the odds means the horse was the betting favorite.\nSource: Equibase Charts\nSaturday, November 2.\nSaturday attendance was 67,811. Betting handle for the 14 Breeders' Cup races on Friday and Saturday was a record $154 million, up 12% from 2018. \nOnly two favorites won on the Saturday card, Covfefe in the Filly and Mare Sprint and Bricks and Mortar in the Turf. Both horses are expected to win their respective divisions at the Eclipse Awards, and Bricks and Mortar is the leading candidate for horse of the year. Mitole, second choice in the Sprint, won that race and is expected to win the champion sprinter title. Despite being upset in the Distaff, Midnight Bisou will likely be named the Champion Older Female Horse. The female turf division is likely a tossup between Uni, who won the Mile, and Sistercharlie, who finished third in the Filly and Mare Turf. The three-year-old divisions are still undecided as none of the leading colts and fillies won.\nIridessa was the only European-trained horse to win at the event. Her trainer Joseph O'Brien became the youngest trainer, at age 26, to ever win a Breeders' Cup race. The son of Aidan O'Brien also became just the second person to have Breeders' Cup wins as both a jockey and trainer: Freddy Head being the other.\nSource: Equibase Charts"

        "text": "An equestrian statue of Paul Revere by Cyrus Edwin Dallin is installed at Paul Revere Mall near the Old North Church in Boston, Massachusetts.\nDescription and history.\nThe sculpture was modeled in 1885, cast in bronze in 1940, and dedicated on September 22 of that year. The statue rests on a Milford pink granite base designed by Y. Lovell Little and Raymond A. Porter. \nTwenty-three-year-old Cyrus Dallin won a competition for the sculpture in 1885 beating out two other finalists: Daniel Chester French and James C. Kelly of New York. Other famous sculptors competed including Thomas Ball. The day following the award French visited Dallin and congratulated him on the award. Boston Mayor Hugh Obrien's signed contract confirmed the award. Dallin executed several versions of the sculpture during the interim period and version number 6 is on display in the Cyrus Dallin Art Museum. But due to a variety of circumstances, the final version would not be installed for over 50 years. \nAt the age of 79 Dallin's project went forward when the George Robert White Fund Trustees accepted Dallin's model for casting and appropriated $27,500 for its execution in bronze. It was cast at the T. F. McGann Foundry in Somerville. \nAt the 1940 dedication event James F. O'Connell, manager of the White Fund presented the statue to the Mayor of Boston, Maurice J. Tobin. The Mayor then introduced Henry L. Shattuck of the Boston City Council to give the dedication address that was heard by thousands. Also in attendance was Raymond J. Kelly who was National Commander of the American legion. \nThe artwork was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's \"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\" program in 1993."

All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus, with the scores summed to give a final total. The scores in each of the six apparatus competitions were added together to give individual all-around scores; the top six individual scores on each team were summed to give a team all-around score. No separate finals were contested.\nFor each exercise, four judges gave scores from 0 to 10 in one-tenth point increments. The top and bottom scores were discarded and the remaining two scores summed to give the exercise total. If the two scores were sufficiently far apart, the judges would \"confer\" and decide on a score. Thus, exercise scores ranged from 0 to 20, apparatus scores from 0 to 40, individual totals from 0 to 240, and team scores from 0 to 1,440."

        "title": "Baseball in Mexico",
        "text": "Baseball first rose to popularity in Mexico during the 1880s, and may have been introduced there as early as 1846. Mexico's current premier baseball league, the Mexican Baseball League, was founded in 1925 and consists of two divisions with 16 teams in total. The Mexican League has been classified as a Triple-A level league since 1967, and was classified as a Double-A league before then.\nThe sport has traditionally been considered one of the most popular sports in Mexico, second only to football in some areas. Baseball is primarily popular in the northern part of the country, in the states nearest the Mexico–United States border. Over 120 different players have made appearances for Major League Baseball teams, the first being Mel Almada who played for the Boston Red Sox starting in 1933. Other notable Mexican MLB players include Fernando Valenzuela, Vinny Castilla, Joakim Soria, and Julio Urias.\nHistory.\nThe exact origin of baseball in Mexico is unclear. While some sources claim that the sport came to Mexico along with American soldiers during the Mexican–American War, others believe it actually arrived via Cuba during the 1880s. The building of the Mexican Central Railway as well as America's economic and political interest in Mexico during the 1880s also played a part in the spread of baseball's popularity south of the Rio Grande.\nIn 1925, the Mexican League (Spanish: Liga Mexicana de Béisbol or LMB) was founded. The Mexican League became a heavy competitor of MLB, going after players from the Nigro League and other Caribbean Leagues. When MLB was interested in a player who signed with the Mexican League, they had an agreement that they would have to pay a fee to the Mexican League in order to use that player. This added cost discouraged MLB from using Mexican players because they didn't want to pay the competing league money. Other leagues like the Cuban League and a league in the Dominican Republic decided to work with MLB, but the Mexican League did not want to participate. All of these leagues contributed to an eventual inclusive baseball league. More than a quarter of all major league baseball players are now Latino. The league initially had 6 teams, and eventually expanded to its 16.\nMel Almeda, an outfielder from Huatabampo, made his debut for the Boston Red Sox on September 8, 1933, becoming the first Mexican-born player to play in the MLB. Almeda was born in Mexico but grew up in Los Angeles, as his father was a consul for the Mexican government. It would be 16 years before another Mexican-born player would play in MLB, when Bobby Ávila made his debut for the Cleveland Indians in 1947.\nAfter World War II, hundreds of MLB players returned from the war creating a huge market and low demand. Club owners from MLB seized the opportunity to offer poor contracts to the players lacking free agency and union. In 1946, then-owner of the LMB, Jorge Pasquel, attempted to elevate the level of competition in the league by offering contracts to several American MLB players. While mostly only Negro league players ended up coming to play in Mexico, contracts were also offered to (and subsequently declined by) superstar players such as Joe DiMaggio, Minnie Miñoso, and Ted Williams, however, other 18 major leaguers signed for the 1946 summer season. At the end of the summer season, top afro american and latin players had earned more than many players in MLB; therefore, major league players started to come to the LMB looking for better salaries, initiating the conflict with MLB.\nIn response to the loss of players to Mexico, the commissioner of MLB at the time, Happy Chandler, enacted a rule that banned players from the league for 5 years if they signed outside of MLB; moreover, they banned the 18 players that signed with the LMB from playing for any team participating in MLB. Later on, MLB threatened to suspend any players playing with or against the banned or blacklisted players. This largely hindered the growth of the LMB during this time. In 1950, the LMB and MLB reached an agreement stating that they would respect each other's contracts. Notable American former LMB players include Satchel Paige and Roy Campanella.\nIn 2018, after complaints about Julio Urías's loss of his signing bonus to his former LMB club, MLB decided to sever their relationship with the Mexican League. This choice effectively bans all MLB teams from signing players directly out of the LMB, which may prevent some top Mexican prospects from making their way to the Majors.\nThe Mexico national baseball team has appeared in many international tournaments since the 1970s. Most recently, the Charros de Jalisco of the Mexican Pacific League competed in the Caribbean Series in 2019.\nProfessional baseball.\nIn 1925, the Mexican League was formed by sports journalist Alejandro Aguilar Reyes and his friend Ernesto Carmona. The league was founded with 6 teams, none of which still operate in the LMB. During the 1960s, the league expanded to 8 teams, and again to 10 teams in 1970. In 1979, the LMB absorbed the Mexican Central League, which expanded the league to 20 teams. After a series of financial failures, the league was reduced to 14 teams. The league has expanded since to its current lineup of 18 teams in two divisions. It is considered to be a AAA-level league.\nTeams in the LMB play 120 games from March to September, and each team plays each other team either 6 or 9 times per season. Like in the MLB, the LMB holds an All-star game as well as a four-level postseason.\nThe team with the most championships are the Diablos Rojos del México.\nThe Mexican Pacific League (Spanish: Liga Mexicana de Pacífico or LMP) is an independent league unaffiliated with the LMB. It has existed since 1945, and currently fields 10 teams from throughout Mexico. Its champions are invited to compete in the Caribbean Series after winning the LMP championship.\nThe Mexican League also has an affiliated minor league, the Liga Norte de México.\nInternational play.\nMexican teams have competed in the Caribbean Series since 1971, winning the championship 3 times in 4 years from 2013 to 2016. The series has been held in Mexico 15 times since then, for the first time in Hermosillo in 1974. The Caribbean Series' first Mexican champions were the Naranjeros de Hermosillo in 1976. Mexico has also competed in the Pan American Games and the Baseball World Cup, performing well but never finishing first. In 2006, the Mexico national baseball team made their first appearance at the inaugural World Baseball Classic, and has competed in each iteration since."

The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.\nIn the first ODI, Ireland's Harry Tector and New Zealand's Michael Bracewell both scored centuries. Bracewell's 127 not out helped New Zealand to win the match by one wicket with one ball remaining. New Zealand won the second ODI by three wickets to win the series with a match to play. New Zealand won the third and final ODI by one run to win the series 3–0.\nNew Zealand won the first T20I by 31 runs, with Glenn Phillips scoring an unbeaten 69 runs. New Zealand also won the second T20I, by the margin of 88 runs, with Dane Cleaver scoring 78 not out and Michael Bracewell taking a hat-trick. New Zealand won the third T20I by six wickets, to also win the T20I series 3–0.\nBackground.\nOriginally, the New Zealand cricket team were scheduled to tour Ireland in June and July 2020, along with a tour Scotland to play an ODI and T20I match. Initially, Cricket Ireland announced that Bready Cricket Club Ground would not be hosting any matches at the venue due to their financial position. However, when Cricket Ireland confirmed the fixtures in December 2019, the T20I matches were confirmed to be taking place at the ground.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic put the tour in doubt. In April 2020, David White, Chief Executive of New Zealand Cricket, said that the tour would be \"most unlikely\" to happen. Later the same month, Cricket Ireland's Chief Executive, Warren Deutrom, stated that international cricket in Ireland during 2020 was at \"high risk\" due to the pandemic. Deutrom later added that New Zealand's tour to Ireland was \"fairly doubtful\". However, the tour was postponed on 15 May 2020 due to the pandemic.\nSquads.\nAdam Milne was ruled out of New Zealand's T20I squad due to an Achilles injury with Jacob Duffy named as his replacement. Ireland's Conor Olphert was ruled out of the T20I series with a knee injury, with Fionn Hand named as his replacement."

        "title": "1929 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": " The 1929 Auckland Rugby League season was its 20th. One of the key events of the season was the tour of the South Sydney side.\nThe First Grade Championship was won by Ponsonby who defeated Devonport in the final 5–0. Marist won the Thistle Cup for competition points accrued during the second round of matches where they went undefeated. They also won the Roope Rooster trophy after defeating Ponsonby in the final 17–9. They weren't finished yet, defeating the same opponent to win the Stormont Shield 28–14. This was the second consecutive year that they won both of those trophies.\nRichmond entered a team into the B Grade which was arguably the first ever 'reserve grade' team in Auckland club rugby league. The B Grade competition was won by Point Chevalier who defeated Otahuhu in the final 13 points to 10. This earned Point Chevalier the right to playoff with Ellerslie who had come last in the A Grade championship losing all 14 of their matches. Ellerslie won the match by 5 points to 0 to remain in A Grade for 1930. Otahuhu beat Point Chevalier 11–0 to win the Stallard Cup which had previously been a knockout competition for the B Grade, however this season a full round robin was played before the final.\n \n \nSeason news and summary.\nAuckland Rugby League management.\nThe annual report for the completed 1928 season revealed that £3272 was taken in gate receipts from club matches alone at Carlaw Park. The total from all matches was £4573 with £517 paid to injured players. A further £609 1s 3d was spent on maintenance and improvement at Carlaw Park. Clubs were also granted £326 18s 5d and charitable causes received £142 10s 4d. League assets including Carlaw Park were reported as £10,569 16s 4d, with a consolidated fund of £9810 11s 9d.\nIt was stated prior to the season that Auckland Rugby League would be concentrating much more on the club game and that no representative games would be played during it. This was in response to the 1928 season where a large representative program had been played along with the hosting of the touring England team. The Senior B competition was weakened considerably after the Kingsland team amalgamated with Grafton Athletic and moved up into the A Grade. The Senior B league was also ‘lowered in status’ with several of the stronger players moving into A grade sides.\nOn 23 April \"The New Zealand Herald\" published a lengthy summary of rugby league in Auckland from its beginnings in 1909 to the present day (1929).\nThe Otahuhu Trotting Club wrote to the Auckland Rugby League advising them that the league could make use of two playing grounds on its property on Tennessee Avenue in Mangere East.\nNew clubs and mergers.\nOn 2 April a new club was formed in Papatoetoe after a meeting was held in their town hall. It was decided to field three junior teams though ultimately they only fielded one team in the 6B Grade. This was not the Papatoetoe Panthers club which was formed at a much later date.\nAt a meeting of the Grafton Athletic and Kingsland Rovers League Football Clubs it was decided to amalgamate and become known as Kingsland Athletic. The meeting was attended by 80 members. They decided that their colours would be a maroon jersey with a blue and gold shield. They requested to be placed in the Senior A Grade. A lengthy discussion was held at a management committee meeting before they agreed to accept the team in the A Grade. This made the number of teams in the grade 8. Their senior team was coached by former New Zealand captain Bert Avery who had been a playing member of Maritime/Grafton Athletic.\nRule changes.\nA rule change brought in for the beginning of the season was to make each half 40 minutes in length rather than 45 minutes. Another rule change occurred prior to round 5 with alterations to the play-the-ball rule. The idea was the prevent players from playing the ball to the side. Players had been allowed to turn their body and pass the ball from the foot to their own team. “On occasions the ball travelled but a few feet, which invariably resulted in players of both teams fighting for possessions on the ground. It must be said that too much of the game is wasted with players lying on the ball. Now it is necessary to play the ball, forwards or backwards, past the opposing player. Should it be kicked to the side, all players must stand outside the five yards limit before the ball can be handled by them”.\nPlayer losses.\nAn ongoing issue for club league in Auckland, and indeed New Zealand were the continuing losses of top players to English clubs. Over three seasons nine players left to join professional English sides. Wigan signed Lou Brown, Ben Davidson and Len Mason, while Wilson Hall played for Leeds, and Roy Hardgrave, Trevor Hall, and Lou Hutt all joined St. Helens. Trevor Hanlon of the Richmond club signed for Broughton Rangers club late in the season.\nImprovements to Carlaw Park.\nAfter a series of very wet matches played at Carlaw Park and many requests for improved changing and washing conditions the Auckland Rugby League met to discuss the matter. They planned to “increase the showers and add hot water installations”. The Devonport delegate said “his club now shared the expense of a bus, and the team went to the Tepid Baths after each match. Another delegate said that hot water provision was required for curtain-raiser and other teams, which did not desire to leave the ground”. The league decided to begin with the work and complete it by Saturday week.\nOn 9 October the Management Committee met regarding the improvement of accommodation at Carlaw Park. Chairman Mr. George Rhodes said that an extra stand with dressing rooms would cost £12,000 which was money that the league did not have. The existing stand was taken up with 800 vice-presidents who gained free entry and so there was little revenue to be gained by adding to this area. He did however say that they were “keen to assist players in providing better dressing rooms and offices where the League could centralise its business.\nSouth Sydney tour.\nSouth Sydney became the first ever Australian club to tour New Zealand. They played three matches. Two were played against Marist Old Boys at Carlaw Park on consecutive Saturdays and a midweek game was played against Huntly in Huntly. They were defeated in the first match 10–9, before winning the return match 25–5.\nMonteith Shield (first grade championship).\nThe Round 6 match between Richmond and Kingsland was postponed as Richmond had travelled to Hikurangi to play against the local team which was in its second season.\nMonteith Shield fixtures.\nPre-season fixture.\n On April 20 several pre-season matches were played at Carlaw Park involving first grade teams and senior B sides. Newton Rangers defeated Richmond Rovers by 10 points to 0 with Roy Hardgrave scoring a try and kicking a penalty and converting W. Johnstone's try. Ellerslie United surprised Devonport United with a 5-5 draw. Marist Old Boys beat City 5-0, Kingsland Athletic beat Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers 13-8, and Mount Wellington and Parnell played out a 0-0 draw. The senior B teams involved were Kingsland-Athletic, Parnell, Mount Wellington, and Northcote.\nRound 1.\nDuring the season Craddock Dufty who had starred for Auckland and New Zealand for several seasons fell out with the Newton club and asked for a transfer to Ellerslie. The Management Committee eventually granted the transfer.In the match between Newton and Marist Roy Hardgrave was concussed and had to leave the field. G Rhodes was also concussed later in the match and was taken to the hospital. For City in their match with Kingsland McLaughlin broke his nose and had to leave for treatment. Cyril Brimble had moved to Newton from the Manukau rugby club. His younger brother Ted Brimble would follow in the following season. And then in 1935 younger brother Wilfred would also join the ranks of Newton. Another brother Walter joined Manukau and he, Ted, and Wilfred, would all go on to represent New Zealand.\nRound 5.\nThe Devonport win over Richmond was their 100th first grade win in their 20th consecutive year in first grade. To this point they had a 100 win, 12 draw, and 85 loss record.\nRound 6.\nAlan Clarke was sent off in the Marist v City game for questioning the referee.\nRound 7.\nIn the match between Marist and Devonport both Ernest Ruby and Campney were sent off for fighting late in the match. For Newton Craddock Dufty refused to play in protest against the non-selection of Wally Somers. As a result Newton cancelled his registration with the club. Somers also decided to retire at this point though he ultimately joined the Ellerslie team for the 1930 season. Dufty then signed with Ellerslie where he had moved to earlier in the year. Cook was sent off in Ellerslie’s match for arguing with a referring decision.\nRound 12.\nW. Shortland, an ex-Maori All Black transferred to City Rovers and made his debut for them. He had previously represented North Auckland at the halfback position. Shortland was said to have played a “sterling game, demonstrating that the thirteen-a-side code suited his particular type of play”. P Skelton also transferred from rugby where he had been playing five eighth for the Grammar Old Boys club. He joined the Ponsonby side and scored a try on debut and also set up their second try for W. Skelton (no relation). Their match was originally scheduled to be played on the number one field as a curtain-raiser but was transferred to the number two field as the former was in a poor condition however the number two ground “soon became a sea of mud”. The Marist and Ellerslie match at the Auckland Domain was postponed as the field was deemed unfit for play. The condition of Carlaw Park was so bad that it was discussed at the management committee meeting later in the week and it was decided that conditions needed to be improved for players immediately.\nRound 13.\nR.D. Revell transferred from Ponsonby to Kingsland during the week.\nRound 14.\nT Hanlon of the Richmond senior side was signed by Broughton Rangers in England. He was due to depart on the Ruahine on August 21. The match at Mt Wellington was the first ever senior match played there making it the 23rd venue for senior rugby league matches in Auckland since 1908.\nPostponed round 6 match.\nThe Round 6 match which was postponed saw Richmond default to Kingsland.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nMarist won the Roope Rooster for the second consecutive year after defeating Ponsonby 17–9 in the final.\nRound 1.\nArnold Berridge joined Richmond after transferring from rugby where he had been an Auckland representative player. He kicked 4 penalties on debut against Devonport in a 17–12 victory. In the match between Ponsonby and Newton, White (the Ponsonby fullback) had to leave the field with a broken collarbone early in the second half. Hammond then left the field with an injured neck and Kenneth Peckham followed him soon after, also injured.\nStormont Memorial Shield.\nFrank Delgrosso went off in the second half with an injured knee.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nTop try and point scorers for A Division and Roope Rooster matches. Frank Delgrosso became just the second player in the competition's history to pass the 100 point mark for matches played in the Monteith Shield (for the first grade competition) and the Roope Rooster when he scored 108 for Ponsonby. The only previous player to do it was Bill Davidson who scored 117 points in 1922. By this point Delgrosso had scored 532 points in total for Ponsonby across all senior matches from 1919 to 1929 which was the most of any player who had played in Auckland to this point. Craddock Dufty was on 495 points however with both players still active they would continue to add to their tallies. Phil Brady of Marist was the top try scorer with 13 closely followed by Schofield of Ponsonby who scored 12.\nB grade standings and results.\nThe Round 5 match between Northcote and Māngere resulted in a win to the former team but the actual score was not stated. The standings include the final played between Ōtāhuhu and Point Chevalier, won by the latter by 13 points to 10.\nSenior B grade fixtures.\nIn the first round of the season Māngere began their match with Ōtāhuhu with just ten players, though had reached thirteen near halftime. It was the first time league had been played on the newly acquired Māngere Domain.\nOn 8 May at the Management Committee meeting Northcote requested that the opening round match in the Senior B competition be awarded to them on account of Richmond B defaulting. However the league said that the match would be replayed at the end of the season if it would affect the outcome of the competition.\nThe Round 8 match between Otahuhu and Point Chevalier was held at Papatoetoe at the Papatoetoe Recreation Ground which was the first senior match played in the area. Around 1,000 spectators turned up to watch the match. Otahuhu won a close fought match 10–6.\nAfter Round 10 was completed the Auckland Rugby League decided that the match between Point Chevalier and Otahuhu would decide the championship. The match was played on Carlaw Park and saw Point Chevalier win by 13 points to 10.\nSenior A/Senior B promotion-relegation match.\nEllerslie had come last in the A Grade for the second year in a row. Though unlike the previous season where they had won 3 matches in 1929 they were winless after battling injuries and the loss of players. However they managed to defeat Point Chevalier, who had won the B Grade by 5 points to 0 and thus remain in the A Grade for the 1930 season.\nLower grades and exhibition games.\nLower grades.\nRichmond won the Davis Shield for lower grade points accumulated once again. They would dominate this trophy throughout the 1920s and 30s.\nLower grade competitions.\nSecond Grade.\nDevonport won the championship after sealing it in round 14 with a 12-0 win over Kingsland. Mount Albert finished runner up just 1 point behind. Mount Albert won the knockout competition when they defeated Devonport on September 28. Mangere had entered a team in the competition but withdrew after defaulting their first two games. The amalgamated New Lynn and Glen Eden club (Glen Lynn) entered a team in the knockout competition, drawing with Newton 6-6, before losing to Ponsonby 18-0.\n The knockout competition was won by Mount Albert United.\nThird grade open (Hayward Shield).\nRichmond won the championship after they beat Glen Lynn in the final by 2 points to 0 a Carlaw Park on August 17. Richmond also won the knockout competition with a 18-0 win over Ellerslie in the final on September 21. They had beaten Ponsonby B by default a week earlier while Ellerslie had upset Kingsland 11-5 in the other. Ellerslie had surprisingly made it to the final after only winning two matches during the championship. The majority of the results were reported and the final standings were published in the newspaper which was very unusual in these early decades.\nThird grade intermediate.\nThe championship was won by Devonport, 3 points ahead of Akarana. The knockout competition was won by Newmarket 7 to 6 on September 28, though the score was also reported as 10-6. Devonport had beaten City by default in one semi final while Newmarket won the other semi final 12-2 against Akarana. Newton entered a team in the competition but they withdrew without playing a game, while Mount Albert withdrew after 10 rounds having only played 7 games. \nFourth grade (Hospital Cup).\nDevonport won the championship undefeated with 16 wins from 16 games, scoring 356 points and only conceding 32. Richmond were runners up 9 further points back. Devonport reportedly won the knockout competition when they beat Richmond 12-5 in the final on October 19. Devonport had won their semi final 6-0 over Akarana, while Richmond beat Kingsland 7-6 in the other semi final. However the Sun newspaper reported that Akarana won the knockout competition on March 29, 1930. Mt Wellington withdrew from the championship after 9 rounds while Remuera withdrew also after playing 9 games but in the 12 rounds having defaulted for 3 weeks.\nFifth grade (Endean Shield).\nRichmond won the championship and also the knockout competition. They defeated Marist 14-9 in the knockout final on 21 September following a semi final win over Point Chevalier by 14 points to 4 while Marist had beaten Kingsland in the other semi final. Otahuhu had initially entered a side but failed to take the field and withdrew after round 1. A table was published in the newspapers after 7 rounds however many of the results in the second half of the season were not reported so the final standings are incomplete.\nSixth grade A (Walker Shield).\nRichmond won the championship ahead of Otahuhu and Marist. Otahuhu won the knockout competition when they beat Richmond 11-6 in the final on October 12. Otahuhu had beaten City in one semi final while Richmond beat Kingsland 11-0 in the other semi final. The standings were reported after 8 rounds but the final standings were not reported and many results were also not reported so the following table is incomplete.\nSixth grade B (Myers Cup).\nRichmond B won the championship with a remarkable point scoring record of 657 points scored with the majority of their wins coming at 0 points conceded. They also won the Milicich knockout final when they beat Northcote 16-2 on September 28. They had beaten Newton 5-3 in their semi final, while Northcote defeated Point Chevalier 2-0 in the other semi final. The championship standings were reported after 8 rounds and again at the conclusion of the season. The team featured future New Zealand international Noel Bickerton.\nSchoolboys competition.\nNewmarket won the championship. They also won the knockout competition when they beat Mangere 25-5 in the final on October 12. At the end of the season in early November a seven team knockout tournament was held at Carlaw Park with proceeds going to the purchase of jerseys. Newmarket defeated Mangere in the final by 6 points to 0 to complete a remarkable season for the side.\nExhibition and junior representative matches.\nThe Auckland Junior representative side that played South Auckland included future Kiwi Albert Laing, and Auckland representative cricket wicket keeper Horace Hunt. The full side was as follows: Albert Laing (Devonport), B. Munroe (Mount Albert), G Jacobs (Mount Wellington), H. Tate (Devonport), T Davis (Richmond), C. Dunn (Richmond), F. Martin (Kingsland), H. White (Ponsonby), D. Kirwan (Mount Albert), Horace Hunt (Devonport), H. Lunn (Ponsonby), H. Forbes (Kingsland), J. Hawkes (Devonport). Reserves: J. Ragg (Newton), C. Jamieson, K. Sheddon (Remuera), F. Joy (Newton), F. Hemmingson (Grey Lynn).\nRepresentative season.\nThe selectors for the season were the same as last year, Edwin V. Fox, Ernie Asher, and Bert Avery. The Auckland team played three matches and defended the Northern Union Challenge Cup against South Auckland, Northland, and Canterbury. Auckland played three matches between July 27 and August 24, all for the Northern Union Challenge Cup. They saw them defeat South Auckland in a hard-fought 11–8 result, the newly formed Northland representative team by a narrow 22–19 margin, and Canterbury comfortably by 47 points to 18. The representative season was finished with a match between the North Island and South Island won by the latter 22 to 13. Unlike in previous years the North Island team featured several players from outside of Auckland, mainly from the Waikato region.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nAuckland v South Auckland (Northern Union Cup).\n W. Shortland had been named to play for Auckland but was left out of the side at the last minute as he was not eligible to play. The reason being that he had only recently switched codes and had not played 3 matches yet for his club. Huatahi Paki (who is pictured) broke his ribs during the match. Lindsay Simons, who was on debut for Auckland at fullback went off injured with Frank Delgrosso moving into that position and Ted Mincham coming on in his Auckland debut. Auckland won the match narrowly by 11 points to 8 before a crowd of 10,000 at Carlaw Park.\nAuckland v Northland (Northern Union Cup).\nThe Northland team was coached by Maurice Wetherill and included Ted Meyer as captain who went on to become a New Zealand representative in 1930. He had previously played rugby union for North Auckland and the North Island. Puti Tipene (Steve) Watene was on debut for Auckland.\nAuckland v Canterbury (Northern Union Cup).\nThe Canterbury side was coached by former Ponsonby, Auckland, and New Zealand player, Thomas McClymont.\nInter island match.\nLen Scott was injured during the match and replaced by Allan Seagar for the North Island while for the South Island Jim Sanders was injured and replaced by Doogan. In past years the North Island team was dominated by players from the Auckland competition however the North Island team on this occasion featured players from outside Auckland such as Dick Trautvetter, Bob Stephenson, Joe Menzies and Tom Timms from the Waikato (South Auckland) side, and Ted Meyer and T Bergan from Northland."

        "title": "Surfing in Sri Lanka",
        "text": "Surfing in Sri Lanka is one of the popular sports in Sri Lanka among foreign tourists despite not being popular among the Sri Lankan locals. Surfing in Sri Lanka dates back to early 1960s. The country has many beaches for surfing, especially in the southern and eastern regions. Places such as Arugam Bay, Hikkaduwa, Weligama, Mirissa and Unawatuna are popular surf spots in Sri Lanka and among tourists. The Tourism in Sri Lanka is also very closely related to the sport of surfing and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau considers the sport of surfing as one of the measures of attracting tourists.\nHistory.\nSurfing was introduced to Sri Lanka somewhere around the 1960s when American surfer Rusty Miller and three of his close friends came to Sri Lanka on a holiday trip to experience surf in Sri Lankan shores. In 1993, Hikkaduwa hosted the first ever Sri Lankan local surfing competition and the tournament was successfully staged by Channa Navaratne along with a small bunch of Americans to kick start an interest among locals on the sport. However, his intention was short lived mainly owing to the 26 year long civil war which ended in 2009. During the civil war, the foreigners were unable to engage in surfing due to security reasons when popular surfing spots such as Arugam Bay and Pasikudah were also engulfed by the terror threats.\nPost Civil War.\nThe Sri Lankan Surf Federation was established in 2017 and the inaugural edition of the National Surf Championship was held in 2018. The winner of the 2018 Sri Lankan National Surf Championship went onto qualify and participate at the 2019 ISA World Surfing Games which was held in Japan. It also marked the first ever instance that a delegation from Sri Lanka had competed in the World Surfing Games. Sri Lanka alongside Lebanon, Thailand and American Samoa also made their debuts at the World Surfing Games during the 2019 edition.\nThe Sri Lankan surf national team also toured India in 2018 and made little progress when they gained second and third places in the Cove-Long Point Surfing Championships in Chennai. During when surfing and tourism were adversely affected due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, SLT Mobitel came in as the official telecommunications partner for the National Surf Championship 2020 in a bid to revive the tourism sector.\nIn late 2018, the Arugam Bay Surf Club officially became the all-female surf club of Sri Lanka when it registered through the Surfing Federation of Sri Lanka. Shamali Sanjaya who is deemed to be the first Sri Lankan native local female surfer is currently serving as the president of Arugam Bay Girls Surf Club. Shamali played an influential role in setting up an all-female surf club in Arugam Bay and she apparently played a vital role in changing the stereotype regarding the participation Sri Lankan women in surfing by being in the forefront of the development and empowerment of female surfers especially in a country like Sri Lanka which has a conservative society. The first ever women-only category surfing competition took place in Arugam Bay in 2020.\nHowever, Sri Lankan surfing endured a major setback in July 2021 when the sports ministry issued an extraordinary gazette to suspend the registration of Surfing Federation of Sri Lanka along with four other sports federations. In July 2021, the government launched a programme to transform Arugam Bay into a worldwide destination for wind surfing.\nRed Bull Ride My Wave, an International Open Surfing Championship is also conducted in Sri Lanka which is sponsored by Red Bull Sri Lanka and several local and international surfers compete in the competition annually. Sri Lankan local surfers Lakshitha Madushan and Nikita Rob were crowned as “King of the Wave” and “Queen of the Wave” respectively in the Red Bull Ride My Wave 2022 contest.\nSurfing spots.\nArugam Bay.\nArugam Bay is the most popular surf spot and is also the only international surf competition venue in Sri Lanka. It is also rated as one of the top ten surf destinations in the world. It has also hosted most of the international surfing competitions in Sri Lanka since 2004. Arugam Bay has also notably hosted two Pro Surf League competitions as part of the World Surf League in 2011 and in 2019. Most notably, Arugam Bay hosted the So Sri Lanka Pro 2019 event which was also the first major international competition to be held in Sri Lanka in 2019 since the Easter Sunday bombings. The event was won by Australia's Mitch Parkinson and Indonesia's Oney Anwar became runnerup.\nThe best season to visit Arugam Bay is generally between April and October. The beach consists of about 6 ft and rides of approximately 400m. It has surf points including Crocodile Rock, Panama, Peanut Farm, Elephant Rock, Okanda and Whiskey Point. \nHikkaduwa.\nHikkaduwa has become a mecca for Sri Lankan surfing. During the Sri Lanka surf season, Hikkaduwa surf attracts thousands between November and March with a mix of shore breaks and reefs for all levels.\nA part of the beach is known for its coral reefs, one of the three Marine National Parks in Sri Lanka.\nThere’s a mixture of different breaks to pick from on the 1,000 metres or so of shoreline that’s occupied by Hikkaduwa. Generally speaking, going north makes things trickier. \nMeanwhile, the southernmost sands of Narigama Beach and Thiranagama Beach extend over 3 kilometers. This wide beach is calm with some luxury hotels and a few quality restaurants. Here are several surf spots there.\nMirissa.\nThe areas such as Kabalana, Midigama, Weligama, Ahangama and Matara in Mirissa are notable spots for surfing."

In the final the Jamaican team were initially disqualified, but were reinstated as the bronze medallists upon appeal.\nSummary.\nMost events during the year do not see this level of talent. These are the all star teams of each of these countries. Even the IAAF World Relays don't always assemble the very best. So in heat 1, Jamaica ran the world leading time. In heat 2, USA bettered it setting up a good final.\nLike the mixed relay, USA was able to assemble a new team of four fresh athletes. Phyllis Francis led off taking an early lead, making up the 3-turn stagger distance and passing both teams, Canada and Ukraine to her outside early into the final turn. Poland's lone fresh athlete Iga Baumgart-Witan and Jamaica's Anastasia Le-Roy held relatively close to the stagger, passing just three step and five steps behind. GBR's Zoey Clark and Belgium's Hanne Claes kept them in the mix after one leg. Second leg for USA was their young hurdling star Sydney McLaughlin. She was so far ahead at the break, there was no need for strategic maneuvering, and she ran a perfect tangent from lane 7 to the beginning of the far turn taking a 5-metre lead on Patrycja Wyciszkiewicz with Britain's Jodie Williams close behind. McLaughlin built up a 9-metre lead by her handoff to the hurdle world record holder Dalilah Muhammad, who true to form from her hurdle race, took off hard, expanding the gap to 15 metres through the first turn. It was almost 20 metres over Poland's Małgorzata Hołub-Kowalik by the handoff, which behind her, Jamaica's Stephenie Ann McPherson was able to pull back lost ground against Britain's fresh Emily Diamond. On anchor USA put 400 meter 4th place Wadeline Jonathas, Jamaica had their rested bronze medalist Shericka Jackson while Poland also had their best finalist, 7th place Justyna Święty-Ersetic, but with that lead, the battle was for silver. Tightening the gap through the turn, Jackson ran by GBR's Laviai Nielsen and Święty-Ersetic on the backstretch. With Jonathas long gone over 20 metres ahead, Święty-Ersetic stayed on Jackson's shoulder through the final turn then pulled into lane 2 for running room. She couldn't sprint by Jackson, but Święty-Ersetic slowly narrowed the gap. Just before Jonathas crossed the finish line, Święty-Ersetic edged back ahead. Unable to respond, Jackson gave up the fight and eased across the finish line with bronze 3 metres behind.\nAided by legs of 49.51 by Francis, 49.78 by McLaughlin, 49.43 by Muhammad and 50.20 by Jonathas, USA ran the #18 time in history. Allyson Felix ran a 49.8 leg in the preliminary round and received a gold medal. It added to her record totals, now of 13 gold and 18 total medals at the World Championships.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were matched or set at the competition:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 6 October at 21:19."

The British team brought in their star Dina Asher-Smith to run the second leg (completing an Asha, Asher-Smith, Ashleigh alliterative combination). Uncharacteristically, USA ran the same four runners.\nOn the first leg of the final, Natalliah Whyte got Jamaica into the lead passing to their star Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce first. Against Asher-Smith, two lanes to her outside and USA's Teahna Daniels three lanes out, Fraser-Pryce appeared to gain slightly against the stagger. Already passed one lane outside of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago's Kelly-Ann Baptiste was left far behind, more indicative of the damage Fraser-Pryce inflicted on the competition. She handed off efficiently to Jonielle Smith. Through the turn, Jamaica had the lead, USA's Morolake Akinosun and GBR's Ashleigh Nelson battling for second with Mujinga Kambundji bringing the Swiss team into contention, chased by China. Jamaica's pass to Jackson had a slight hesitation but they left the zone with a 3 metre lead. GBR entered the final zone side by side with USA. GBR's stick, passing to Daryll Neita, never stopped moving. Comparatively, USA ran up onto Kiara Parker. In all GBR gained a metre and a half coming out of the zone with Switzerland's pass to Salomé Kora keeping pace. Jackson held Jamaica's lead across the finish line with Neita running a strong leg to keep the pressure on. Parker was unable to make any gain, but USA held off a fast closing Switzerland for bronze.\nChina's final pass from Kong Lingwei to Ge Manqi was disastrous. While being competitive for a bronze medal in the World Championships, they were unable to complete the pass within the 30 metre zone. Two metres after the zone, Ge stopped with both athletes holding the baton. Ge released it and both athletes ran back into the zone, hesitated in the middle for a moment, then on to just outside the beginning of the (previous rules) zone.

        "text": "The men's 4 × 100 metres relay at the 2019 World Athletics Championships was held at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, Qatar, from 4 to 5 October 2019.\nSummary.\nBackground.\nDefending champion Great Britain was back with two members of their winning team, taking the qualifying heats with a world leading time. South Africa set the African continental record as they qualified winning the other heat. In a familiar situation, despite having the gold and silver medalists on their team, USA struggled with their handoff, completing their handoff at the end of the third zone and missing disqualification by inches or a favorable judge's decision. USA was the slowest qualifier into the final, just .08 ahead of Italy setting their national record in the adjacent lane. Because of the poor qualification position, USA drew lane 8. Instead of a substitute anchor runner, they went with their \"A\" team, putting in 200 meter champion Noah Lyles. Lyles spent the 2019 season coming back after slow starts, essentially demonstrating his superior top end speed. In a relay with a rolling start, his slow starts are negated. USA put the fastest starter, now the fastest man in the world, Christian Coleman in the blocks running against GBR's fastest turn runner Adam Gemili.\nRace.\nColeman did his part, gaining rapidly on China's best starter Su Bingtian to his outside. With a smooth handoff, as Justin Gatlin took his first step, he was ahead of China meaning USA would have no traffic interference for the rest of the race. One lane inside of Coleman, Gemili also did his job, keeping GBR close. Shuhei Tada for Japan also gained on World Relays champion Brazil.\nOn the second leg, Gatlin separated from Xu Zhouzheng and Zharnel Hughes also lost a little to the Olympic champion, but USA was right where GBR could watch them. Mike Rodgers had to hesitate to get the baton from Gatlin, but with USA's history, there was no disaster. GBR's handoff was also hesitant, with Richard Kilty having to decelerate to not run out of the handoff zone, but Japan passed quickly to former junior world record holder Yoshihide Kiryū to keep them close. Through the turn, Rodgers separated from Kilty, Kiryū also gained with Japan passing in second place and South Africa was pulling close to Brazil to create a traffic jam. USA handed off cleanly to Lyles, as if they had practiced the handoff in advance. Japan handed off to their national record holder Abdul Hakim Sani Brown, GBR handed off to Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, South Africa gave it to #6 on the season Akani Simbine and Brazil had Paulo André de Oliveira. And they were off to the races.\nWith a metre and a half advantage, Lyles expanded it to three metres by the finish. Lyles crossed the line holding the baton in the air in victory. Mitchell-Blake gained slightly to battle Brown for the medals, taking silver by a half a metre. Behind them de Oliveira came back on Simbine to nip South Africa at the line.\nUSA's 37.10 tied Jamaica's rescinded Usain Bolt/Asafa Powell powered 2008 Olympic team for the third fastest ever and the American record. Great Britain's 37.36 tied two more Bolt led Jamaican World Championship teams from 2013 and 2015 for the sixth best ever and the European record. Japan's 37.43 moved them into #14 in history, #4 as a country and the Asian record. And Brazil moved to become the #8 country, just behind South Africa's now #7 place from their faster race the trials and set the South American record improving on the one they tied in the trials. In all four continental records and nine national records among the 16 team event.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were matched or set at the competition:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 5 October at 22:15."

They led off with their bronze medalist Fred Kerley, but the early leader was Jamaica's Akeem Bloomfield, with Belgium's Jonathan Sacoor also in the mix. Down the home stretch, Kerley pulled back ground as Bloomfield slowed, by the handoff, USA had a step on Jamaica. Michael Cherry expanded USA's advantage over Jamaica's Nathon Allen through the turn to take 3 metres at the break. Behind him, Colombia's Diego Palomeque also ran a strong turn to pip Belgium's Robin Vanderbemden for third place. Through the final turn, Allen pulled in a metre on Cherry. While losing ground to the leaders, Trinidad and Tobago's Jereem Richards brought them into a 3-way battle for bronze. Onto the home stretch, Allen started losing ground to Cherry, sliding back toward the battle. With five metres, Cherry handed off to London, wearing a white sweatband on his head. In early strategy sessions, USA probably planned on their new superstar who wears a similar sweatband, Michael Norman, anchoring, but had to rearrange after Norman shut it down during his 400 semi-final. Jamaica's Terry Thomas took off after London, gaining strongly on the backstretch to shadow London through the final turn. Thomas set himself up to pounce coming off the turn, instead London slowly began widening the gap, getting the lead back to 4 metres before he named off to Norman's training partner, hurdler Rai Benjamin. Behind London and Thomas, Belgium's Dylan Borlée put an early gap on Colombia's Jhon Solís and was now free by 3 metres at the handoff to his brother Kevin Borlée. Benjamin slowly expanded his lead on Jamaica's Demish Gaye, by the finish it was 11 metres. Another 12 metres behind Jamaica, Borlée was able to hold off Colombia's new find, silver medalist Anthony Zambrano for bronze.\nUSA's 2:56.69 was the fastest relay in 11 years, number 11 on the all time list. 8 of the 10 times ahead of them are also USA teams.

The Olympic champion Brianna McNeal disappeared quickly after twitching in her blocks before the gun and being disqualified for a false start in her heat. Even after losing the =#4 and #6 runners in history, the final still sported the world record holder, Kendra Harrison, the season's world leader Danielle Williams with the #7 time in history set a little over two months earlier and the #16 runner in history Janeek Brown from winning the NCAA Championships 4 months earlier, the last two among three Jamaicans who made it to the final.\nAt the gun of the final, Harrison and Williams got out together with the lead. In lane 9, Megan Tapper got one of the worst starts imaginable to a world championship final, stuttering to the first hurdle and hitting it. By the second hurdle, Olympic silver medalist Nia Ali joined Harrison and Williams in the lead. Over the next two hurdles, Ali and Williams mirrored each other as Harrison lost a few inches. As they cleared the sixth hurdle, Williams began losing ground, as Ali pressed a definite advantage which she continued to expand over the remaining hurdles. Harrison also went past Williams as Tobi Amusan was gaining from behind. Ali crossed the finish line with more than a metre over Harrison. Harrison held off Amusan to get bronze.\nAli's 12.34 winning time took a tenth of a second off her personal best, moving her from =#26 of all time to =#9 with Sharika Nelvis. In fifth place, Andrea Vargas improved her own Costa Rican national record for the fourth time in the 2019 season.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first four in each heat (Q) and the next four fastest (q) qualified for the semi-final.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first two in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 6 October at 20:51."

This would have been the 73rd season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held, and was US college hockey's 126th year overall. However, the postseason tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn February, seven members that had previously announced their withdrawal from the WCHA following the 2020–21 season announced that they were reforming the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, and that the new conference would begin play with the 2021–22 season.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the NCAA, along with several conferences, decided to ban spectators from attending many of the games played after March 10, 2020, including the 2020 Frozen Four. Additionally, due to the threat of infection, Harvard and Yale withdrew from their conference tournament on March 11, effectively ending their seasons. On March 12, the NCAA canceled the tournament outright, along with all other winter and spring championships.\nPairWise Rankings.\nThe PairWise Rankings (PWR) are a statistical tool designed to approximate the process by which the NCAA selection committee decides which teams get at-large bids to the 16-team NCAA tournament. Although the NCAA selection committee does not use the PWR as presented by USCHO, the PWR has been accurate in predicting which teams will make the tournament field.\nFor Division I men, all teams are included in comparisons starting in the 2013–14 season (formerly, only teams with a Ratings Percentage Index of .500 or above, or teams under consideration, were included). The PWR method compares each team with every other such team, with the winner of each “comparison” earning one PWR point. After all comparisons are made, the points are totaled up and rankings listed accordingly.\nWith 60 Division I men's teams, the greatest number of PWR points any team could earn is 59, winning the comparison with every other team. Meanwhile, a team that lost all of its comparisons would have no PWR points.\nTeams are then ranked by PWR point total, with ties broken by the teams' RPI ratings, which starting in 2013-14 is weighted for home and road games and includes a quality wins bonus (QWB) for beating teams in the top 20 of the RPI (it also is weighted for home and road).\nWhen it comes to comparing teams, the PWR uses three criteria which are combined to make a comparison: RPI, record against common opponents and head-to-head competition. Starting in 2013–14, the comparison of record against teams under consideration was dropped because all teams are now under comparison.\nPlayer stats.\nScoring leaders.\nUpdated as of games played on March 8, 2020.\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nLeading goaltenders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\""

        "text": "Joe Dawson (Hebrew: ג'ו דאוסן; born May 16, 1960) is an American-Israeli former professional basketball player. He played high school basketball at Druid High School in his native Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and played four years of college basketball for the Southern Miss Golden Eagles, leading the team in scoring and rebounding multiple times and was an all-conference selection. After going undrafted in the 1982 NBA draft, he started his professional career in the Continental Basketball Association, and was selected as an all-star in each of the three seasons he played there. After a brief experience in the USBL he moved abroad, playing in Venezuela and France (where he was the LNB Pro A top scorer). In 1987 he had his first experience in the Israeli league with Hapoel Holon: he would play in Israel for 14 seasons, leading the league in both scoring and rebounding in 1992. He was named the 1992 Israeli Basketball Premier League MVP. He was inducted in the Southern Miss Hall of Fame in 2011, and is the father of professional basketball player Shawn Dawson.\nHigh school career.\nDawson was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where he attended Druid High School. During his high school years he played both the guard and forward positions, and he was selected as a starter from his sophomore year. As a senior he averaged 21.4 points per game, shooting 53% from the field and 78% from the free throw line, and was selected in the 4A All-State first team.\nCollege career.\nDawson signed to play for the Southern Miss Golden Eagles in April 1978. As a freshman Dawson scored 341 points, which at the time ranked second in Southern Miss history for a freshman behind Tom Bishop's 404 points in 1949–50, and recorded 280 rebounds, which ranked him second among all Golden Eagles freshmen behind Bill Lundberg's 305 rebounds in the 1959–60 season. Dawson started 25 out of 27 games, ranked third on the team in scoring (12.6 points per game) and led the team in rebounding with 10 per game. On November 29, 1978, Dawson recorded 20 rebounds in a game against Missouri Western. The following season Dawson was the team leader in minutes played, minutes per game, field goal percentage, points per game (18.2) and rebounds per game (10.6). His performance during his sophomore season earned him a second-team All-South Independent selection by the Associated Press.\nDawson's junior year saw him average 15.4 points (second behind Eddie Jiles) and 10.3 rebounds (first); he also led the team in field goal percentage and minutes per game (a career-high 37.5). During the season he reached 1,000 career points on January 10, 1981, against Biscayne, one of the fastest player to reach the mark in Southern Miss history. At the end of the season he was selected as an All-American by \"Sporting News\" and was a first-team Associated Press All-Conference selection. In his senior season Dawson averaged 17.2 points, 8.7 rebounds, 35.6 minutes per game (all team-highs) and ended his career with 1,695 total points, which ranked him third all-time (he ranks 4th as of 2019). He was selected for the second year in a row in the All-South Independent first team by the Associated Press, and again was named an All-American by \"Sporting News\". His 1,069 career rebounds rank him 4th all-time.\nProfessional career.\nAfter the end of his senior season at Southern Miss, Dawson was automatically eligible for the 1982 NBA draft. After going undrafted, he joined the Maine Lumberjacks of the Continental Basketball Association, where he averaged 14.4 points and 8.6 rebounds over 40 games in his first season as a professional player, and was selected as a CBA All-Star. In 1983 he joined the Bay State Bombardiers and he improved his averages to 22.5 points and 11.1 rebounds per game in 35.4 minutes of play, earning another All-Star selection: he also played 5 postseason games, averaging 19.2 points and 7.8 rebounds. He played another season with the Bombardiers in 1984–85, recording career-highs in scoring (25.9) and rebounding (11.9) and led the CBA in steals per game with 2.5. In 1985 he then joined the Connecticut Colonials, a team from New Haven, Connecticut, and played in the inaugural United States Basketball League season: he ranked 4th in the league in rebounding (9.7 per game) and second in field goal percentage with .571, and was selected in the All-USBL Second Team.\nDawson left the United States for the first time in his career to join Cocodrilos de Caracas, a Venezuelan team: during his time there he recorded 50 double-doubles and was named MVP of the 1986 season. In 1986 he moved to Europe and signed for French club Mulhouse BC: during his only season with the club he LNB Pro A Best Scorer award averaging 35.3 points per game, the highest mark since 1973 (tied with Keith Edmonson's 1986 season).\nIn 1987 he had his first experience in Israel: he joined Hapoel Holon for the 1987–88 season and in 22 games he averaged 24.9 points. In 1988 he went back to France and signed for second division club Évreux: he averaged 31.2 points and 8.3 rebounds in 26 games, playing 37.6 minutes per game; he also shot 39.7% from the three-point line and 82.8% from the free throw line. In 1990 he moved to Israel again and played 10 games with Beitar Tel Aviv, averaging 28.8 points, 9.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists. In 1991 he also played for the Memphis Rockers of the World Basketball League, and was named in the All-WBL first team.\nIn 1991 Dawson signed for Hapoel Eilat, and in the 1991–92 season he led the league in both scoring and rebounding, averaging 27.5 points and 10.7 rebounds per game while shooting 71% from the field and 84% from the free throw line. He was named the 1992 Israeli Basketball Premier League MVP. He stayed with Hapoel for the following two seasons, and in 1993–94 again averaged a double-double with 23.9 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. In 1994 he signed with Maccabi Jerusalem, and in his first season he averaged 21.7 points and 8.2 rebounds, and in the following year he recorded 18.6 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. In 1996 he went back to Eilat and joined Hapoel for the second time in his career, playing for the team until 1998.\nIn 1998 he signed for Maccabi Rishon LeZion, for which he played 3 seasons from 1998 until 2001. He then changed 5 teams in his last 7 years of professional career, playing for Hapoel Holon, Hapoel Jerusalem, Maccabi Ashdod, Ironi Ramat Gan and finally Ironi Nes Ziona, where he ended his career at the age of 48.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1992 he married an Israeli national and acquired Israeli citizenship.

In 2012, they were officially endorsed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as an Affiliate member In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Russia and other ICC Members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\nHistory.\nThe game was played in St. Petersburg as early as the 1870s. In 1875, the British inhabitants of the city tested the mariners of the Prince of Wales' Royal Yacht Osbourne in a match. The Communist Revolution of 1917 put paid to the spread of cricket in Russia as it was viewed as an activity of the \"middle class\" and playing it was deprecated. With the British moving out of St. Petersburg following the Revolution, the game rapidly disappeared with them.\nBy 1995 cricket was played again in Russia, where two groups made up of expatriates took part in a friendly match. In 2004 the United Cricket League was registered as a lawful entity, presently renamed Cricket Russia. Cricket Russia is the main enrolled National Governing Body for Cricket in Russia. The Russia national cricket team played their first home representative match against a touring side from North Wales, Carmel and District Cricket Club, at the Moscow State University Baseball Stadium in 2007. Cricket in Russia is recognised by the Multisport Association of Russia; this is the relationship for all sporting governing associations inside Russia which are not yet Olympic sports. In 2012 Cricket Russia joined the ICC.\nIn July 2019, cricket was not included on Russia's list of official sports. It meant that Cricket Russia did not receive government funding over the year. However, in May 2020, the Russian Government reversed its decision, recognising cricket as a sport, and therefore eligible for funding."

        "text": "Boxing Libreville is a documentary film released in 2018 about the struggles and hardship a young Gabonese man, Christ, has in his journey to be a boxer and how it is mirrored in the struggle for democracy in the country. It is directed by Amédée Pacôme Nkoulou, and is his feature length film debut.\nSynopsis.\nFilmed in 2016 Christ Olsen Mickala is a young aspiring boxer living in Libreville, the capital of the central African nation of Gabon. Christ spends all day training in boxing, while at night he works as a doorman at local nightclubs to make ends meet. Meanwhile, the struggle Christ endures in his boxing dream is mirrored by the struggle for democracy in Gabon during that year's controversial and hotly contested presidential election. Although the election seems to be only a background, its impact on Gabon will affect its people for many years to come.\nProduction.\nThe documentary was produced by Princess M, ADV productions, and Les Films du Bilboquet. As is often the case with African cinema, special care was taken to avoid censorship, such as focusing primarily on Christ's life and training and not on politics, although the latter is a major undertone of the film. The production of the film was an international collaboration, with Princess M being based in Gabon, ADV productions being based in Belgium, and Les Films du Bilboquet being based in France.\nRelease and reception.\n\"Boxing Libreville\" was enthusiastically received. It received the award for best documentary at the Festival de cine africano de Tarif in Spain. The film also received the Special Jury Prize of the Agadir International Documentary Film Festival in Morocco. \"Boxing Libreville\" was entered in the International Short and Medium Film Competition at the Visions du Réel. It was screened at several other film festivals, including the Internationales Dokumentarfilmfestival München and Ecrans Noirs in Cameroon. The director has discussed creating a sequel."

Isurus would later go on to win the 2016 LAS Closing Cup and the 2017 LAS Opening Cup, the latter of which qualified them for the 2017 Mid-Season Invitational. Despite consistently placing top three in the LAS, Isurus would not win another title until the creation of the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2019.\nIsurus won both the opening and closing cups of the LLA's 2019 season, the former qualifying them for the play-in stage of the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational and the latter qualifying them for the play-in stage of the 2019 World Championship. At the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational, Isurus was placed in Group A of the first round of the play-in stage, along with Australian team Bombers, Turkish team 1907 Fenerbahçe, and Vietnamese team Phong Vũ Buffalo. Isurus finished tied for last in Group A with Bombers, placing tenth to twelfth overall.\nAt the 2019 World Championship, Isurus was placed in Group B of the first round of the play-in stage, along with European team Splyce and Japanese team DetonatioN FocusMe. Following the double round robin Isurus placed second in Group B with a 2–2 record, qualifying for the second round, where they were defeated by Hong Kong Attitude and eliminated from the tournament."

        "text": "The women's 1500 metres at the 2019 World Athletics Championships was held at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, Qatar, from 2 to 5 October 2019.\nSummary.\nLike the men, championship level women's 1500s also typically turn into strategic, sit and kick affairs. In 2017, strategic worked for Faith Kipyegon to leave the world record holder Genzebe Dibaba behind. Sifan Hassan was also left behind by that tactic. In 2019, she set the world record in the mile and had already won the 10,000 metres at these championships.\nThe final started inauspiciously enough, Gabriela DeBues-Stafford eventually found herself in the lead, Hassan dropped to the back of the pack. After 200 metres, Hassan moved out to lane 2 and moved forward around everyone into the lead. Kipyegon and Gudaf Tsegay moved in behind her to watch. Even with the slow start the first lap was 1:03.51. None of the chasing runners looked relaxed, most were working hard to stay up. Laura Muir and Jenny Simpson moved up toward the front. The second lap was 1:02.44. During the third lap, Muir positioned herself for the final lap, getting onto Kipyegon's shoulder coming onto the home stretch, then up to Hassan's just before the bell at 2:52.59. Muir stayed in position through the turn, Kipyegon and Tsegay behind her a gap forming behind. Hassan ran the third lap in 1:01.46, then looked back at Muir and took off sprinting. A big gap formed quickly, Kipyegon going around Muir in chase. Hassan kept looking back like a hunted animal being chased, but the gap continued to grow as did Kipyegon's separation from the next group of four; Muir, Tsegay, Shelby Houlihan with DeBues-Stafford trying to hold on. As Kipyegon saw hope was lost, she began to slow back toward the chasers. Houlihan moved to lane 2 to try to sprint past Tsegay, instead Tsegay pulled away gaining on Kipyegon. Hassan won by close to 15 metres. Kipyegon glided across the line for silver barely ahead of a rapidly closing Tsegay.\nHassan's time of 3:51.95, places her as the #6 runner in history behind Dibaba and two infamous races in China in the 1990s. Well beaten, Kipyegon, Tsegay and Houlihan moved to #11, #13 and #15 on that list respectively. Even sixth place DeBues-Stafford ranks as #21. Hassan set the European record that had been held by Soviet Tatyana Kazankina for 39 years, Houlihan the North American record, Kipyegon the Kenyan record and DeBues-Stafford the Canadian record.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first six in each heat (Q) and the next six fastest (q) qualified for the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first 5 in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 5 October at 20:55."

Those three held their positions until the end of the second round, when 2015 champion Denia Caballero dropped in a 66.80m to move into silver position. In fact, the three over 66 and a half metres would be the only ones over 63.50m all day.

The championship served as a capstone for the MIAC season and was used as a final argument for a bid to the Division III NCAA Tournament. Despite not possessing an automatic bid the MIAC tournament champion was selected for the National Tournament each year. For the first four seasons the tournament had all rounds played as two-game total-goal series but changed to single-elimination for all round beginning with the 1990 tournament. Five years later the format was again changed, this time to a two-game point system where the first team to three points would win; one point was awarded for a tie and two points for a win. If the two teams were tied after two games than a 20-minute mini-game was played to determine the winner. By NCAA regulations mini-games were not counted in the standings and were only used to determine which team advanced. In 2000 the MIAC was among the conferences to receive the first automatic bids into the D-III championship, formalizing a practice that had already been in place. The 2021 tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n1995.\n&lt;br&gt;\n1996.\n&lt;br&gt;\n1997.\n&lt;br&gt;\n1998.\n&lt;br&gt;\n1999.\n&lt;br&gt;\n2000.\n&lt;br&gt;\n2001.\n&lt;br&gt;\n2015.\n&lt;br&gt;"

However, their price, meager by international standards, still puts them out of reach of a significant portion of the populace. A modest infrastructure, including bicycle lanes and bicycle parking, has likewise developed. Foreign and domestic bicycles are available, with used Japanese models particularly coveted.\nCyclists must reportedly obtain a license by passing a road safety test, and must register bicycles and display a corresponding tag as proof, though the law is often flouted outside the capital. Conflicting reports exist that women are, or have been, banned from riding bicycles, with some claiming the ban to be a personal edict of Kim Jong-il; however, female cyclists are a common sight in North Korea's large cities, indicating this law, too, if it ever existed, is widely ignored.\n\"Ryomyong\" bicycle-sharing.\nIn 2017, \"Tongil News\" reported the introduction of a bicycle-sharing system in Pyongyang, called \"Ryomyong\" (려명 \"Dawn\"), sharing photographs from the Russian embassy. \"The Pyongyang Times\" later published photographs of stations, reporting that the system is overseen by the Pyongyang Bicycle Rental Office (평양자전거임대관리소), with bicycles manufactured domestically by a North Korean/Chinese joint venture, Phyongjin Bicycle Cooperative Company (평진자전거합영회사), located in Sosong district (서성구역).

        "text": "Los Pynandi World Cup Stadium (Spanish: Estadio Mundialista Los Pynandi), also known as Arena Pynandi , is a beach soccer stadium in Luque, Gran Asunción, Paraguay. It is located on the grounds of the Paraguayan Olympic Committee and was purpose-built to be the host venue of the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.\nConstruction.\nParaguay's bid to host the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup was all but confirmed as successful on 1 October 2018. The Paraguayan Football Association (APF) put the stadium's construction contract out to tender on 15 October which ultimately went to the consortium of Cima-Ritter. Engineer Dionisio Lovera was tasked with coordinating the works, whilst Rubén García is credited as the stadium's architect.\nThe constructors subsequently broke ground on the designated greenfield host site, on land belonging to the Paraguayan Olympic Committee, in early January 2019, with the full works scheduled to last for seven months. By mid-April, all foundations had been laid, structural columns were in place and the main stand was partially complete, with other stands beginning to be raised; work was described as being on schedule. On 16 July, the site was visited by APF president, Robert Harrison and a selection of FIFA delegates who viewed the progress of works firsthand. In early August, construction had entered its \"final phase\"; all structural elements were complete, the pitch drainage system functional, and work was now focused on aesthetic and broadcasting elements.\nThe stadium reportedly cost US$1.5 million to build, with investment from both FIFA and the APF. Its construction created around 200 jobs; the workforce and materials used were all nationally sourced, with the sand comprising the playing field sourced from the banks of the Paraguay River. The structural framework of the stadium is that of reinforced concrete and brick.\nOpening.\nThe arena, now completed, first hosted the Paraguay national team for training on 6 September and then hosted the 2019 Copa Libertadores de Beach Soccer tournament from 14–21 September.\nHowever, it was not officially opened until 9 November, two weeks before the World Cup for which it was primarily commissioned, during a ceremony in which FIFA president Gianni Infantino inaugurated the stadium under the name \"Los Pynandi World Cup Stadium\" (\"Los Pynandi\" meaning \"barefoot\" in Guarani, the nickname of the Paraguay national team). Alongside him was the president of Paraguay, Mario Abdo Benítez, CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez and APF president Robert Harrison, among others, who all made positive statements regarding the design and execution of the construction.\nFacilities.\nThe stadium satisfies FIFA requirements for beach soccer venues: the main stand, the only roofed section, includes four changing rooms for players, two changing rooms for referees, a medical area, a press room, offices, a multipurpose space, an anti-doping room and VIP area. There is also designated seating for VIPs, press and high profile/FIFA delegates. Public bathrooms are available in all stands.\nRegarding access, the main stand houses an elevator designed for wheelchairs, meanwhile another stand features a special access ramp and an area adapted to accommodate the disabled; consideration has also been given to ambulance and fire access. \nThe stadium is equipped with TV platforms and floodlights operating at up to 2000 lux. In total, the floor area of the stadium encompasses around 5000m2, with the playing surface accounting for 1,880m2. FIFA reports the final seating capacity figure at 2,820.\nAt the time of its construction, Ricardo Torres, president of the APF Beach Soccer Division claimed the stadium was the first and only beach soccer stadium of its kind in the world, being of concrete. It is a permanent stadium intended to leave a \"legacy for Paraguayan and regional sports\"."

        "title": "Billiards and Snooker Control Council",
        "text": "The Billiards and Snooker Control Council (B&amp;SCC) (formerly called the Billiards Association and Control Council (BA&amp;CC)) was the governing body of the games of English billiards and snooker and organised professional and amateur championships in both sports. It was formed in 1919 by the union of the Billiards Association (founded in 1885) and the Billiards Control Club (founded in 1908).\nThe B&amp;SCC lost control of both the amateur and professional games in the early 1970s, following a dispute with professional players over challenge matches for the World Billiards Championship, and dissatisfaction from snooker associations outside the UK about the balance of voting power in the organisation, with a large proportion of votes being held in a small number of English areas. Following the loss of its government funding, the B&amp;SCC went into voluntary liquidation in 1992 and its assets were later acquired by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.\nThe Billiard Association.\nOn 31 January 1885, a meeting took place at \"The Sportsman's\" offices to consider revising the rules of billiards, chaired by a Mr. A. H. Collins-Orme and attended by the majority of the prominent professional billiards players. This followed an article written by journalist Alf Burnett criticising the existing rules. Burnett and Peter Jennings contacted the players with a view to getting together to rewrite the rules.\nCollins-Orme proposed that an association be created. This was agreed, and \"The Billiard Association of Great Britain and Ireland, India and the Colonies\" (known as the Billiard Association) was formed. Ten players were tasked with authoring a new set of rules for English billiards. They were John Roberts Jr. (Chairman), Joseph Bennett, Fred Bennett, George Collins, William Cook, John Roberts Sr., Billy Mitchell, John North, W. J. Peall, Joe Sala and Tom Taylor. The group met weekly in a dining area at the Royal Aquarium, and finished writing the rules on 21 September 1886. The rules were published soon after that. Sydenham Dixon, a staff member at \"The Sportsman\" was the driving force behind the formation of the Billiards Association, and the newspaper retained a strong influence over the association's affairs. The influence of the paper over the Association later led to prominent player John Roberts Jr. (who became the Billiards Champion in February 1885 when Cook failed to respond to Roberts' challenge for the title) refusing to recognise the Association's authority.\nThe Association came to be recognised as the governing body for billiards, and organised amateur and professional championships. They also produced templates for standard sizes, which tables had to conform to if made on them were to be recognised in official records. The March 1885 match between John Roberts Jr. and Cook, which Roberts won 3,000-2,980 was the first to be held under the rules of the Association. An amateur championship under the \"all in\" rules, with no restrictions on the number of consecutive scoring shots that could be played, was organised by the Association in 1892, when Sam Christey beat Sidney Fry 1,500–928. The competition was restricted to players from Great Britain before 1917, which was the first year that champions from other Commonwealth countries were allowed to enter. From 1926, only English and Welsh players were allowed to participate, and the event was renamed the English Amateur Championship. The first snooker competition organised by the Billiard Association was the English Amateur Championship of 1916, which was played to benefit the British Sportsmen's Motor Ambulance Fund.\nBilliards Control Council and amalgamation.\nThe Billiards Association's control over the professional game of billiards was challenged by the Billiards Control Council (BCC), formed in 1908, which issued a different set of rules. The key differences in the BCC's version were that a player could not make more than two miss shots successively, and a simpler explanation of penalties. The professional players changed their allegiance to the newer Control Council, and the professional championships were played under BCC rules, whilst most amateurs continued to play under Billiards Association rules. The two organisations decided that it was in their mutual interest to amalgamate, and formed the Billiards Association and Control Club, later renamed the Billiards Association and Control Council (BA&amp;CC), in 1919. Willie Smith defeated Claude Falkiner 16,000-14,500 to win the first BA&amp;CC title, in May 1920. There were many variations of the rules of snooker at the time, and the new Association codified the rules of snooker in 1919. The new rules included the concept of a in the event of points being level at the end of a frame, and having a instead of playing from when there was no clear shot at the after a .\nProfessional billiard player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis had noticed the increasing popularity of snooker in the mid-1920s, and Davis and Birmingham billiard equipment manager Bill Camkin persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. The final of the first snooker world championship in 1927 was held at Camkin's Hall, and Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis 20–11 (although Davis had reached the winning margin at 16–7 before \"dead frames\" were played to take the total to the agreed 31 frames) in the final.\nIn 1935, the Women's Billiards Association (WBA) affiliated to the BA&amp;CC and on 10 June 1936, the Billiards Association and Control Council agreed to take over management of the WBA. Lord Lonsdale, president of the BA&amp;CC, also became president of the WBA.\nLoss of control of the professional game.\nLeslie Driffield, a member of the BA&amp;CC Council, was present at a meeting where the Council nominated him as the challenger to Rex Williams for the professional Billiards Championship. Williams declined to play Driffield within the five months time limit that the BA&amp;CC Council had set, which expired on 7 July 1970, and forfeited the title, which was then contested between Driffield and Jack Karnehm in June 1971. On 1 October 1970, the Professional Billiard Players Association, which had been reestablished in 1968 Williams and seven other players, disaffiliated from the BA&amp;CC. The Professional Billiard Players Association changed its name to the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association on 12 December 1970, and declared itself the governing body for the professional game, recognising Williams as champion. Driffield and Karnehm were, at first, the only two professionals to recognise the BA&amp;CC as continuing to have authority over the game. From 1972, the WPBSA organised the World Snooker Championship.\nThe BA&amp;CC had its own premises for the first time in 1970, when it opened offices and a match room, based in Haringey. Vera Selby and Alf Nolan were among the players who took part in exhibition matches at the official opening. On 21 January 1971 the Billiards Association and Control Council changed its name to the Billiards and Snooker Control Council (B&amp;SCC).\nLoss of control of the international amateur game.\nThe B&amp;SCC had a proportional representation system of delegate voting that meant that the representatives from just two English counties, Lancashire and Yorkshire, could outvote the rest of the world. A World Billiards and Snooker Council (WB&amp;SC) was established in 1971, following a meeting of a number of national associations at a hotel in Malta during the IBSF World Billiards Championship. The associations were dissatisfied that the B&amp;SCC was controlling both the UK and international games. Player and journalist Clive Everton served as the first secretary, and his office served as the first office of the WB&amp;SC. In 1973, the WB&amp;SC renamed itself as the International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF) and began to control non-professional billiards and snooker championships.\nDecline.\nFrom 1967 to 1989 the B&amp;SCC had received Sports Council grants, but this was, according to Everton, stopped \"on the grounds of limited efficiency\", and at the beginning of the 1990s, the B&amp;SCC was struggling financially as a result of the removal of this funding. The London and Home Counties Billiards and Snooker Association cut links with the B&amp;SCC in 1990, to start a new English Billiards and Snooker Federation.\nIn 1992, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) was expected to take over the B&amp;SCC, but following a vote of the B&amp;SCC members approving this, the WPBSA discovered that the B&amp;SCC had undeclared contingent liabilities of £100,000 and cancelled the planned takeover. The B&amp;SCC then went into voluntary liquidation.\nThe WPBSA took over the running of tournaments that had been organised by the B&amp;SCC, and paid the prize money originally announced. It also bought the B&amp;SCC's trophies and other assets from the liquidator and ran the amateur game whilst looking to support the establishment of successor bodies to the B&amp;SCC.\nSuccessor organisations.\nInternational.\nThe World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association is responsible for governing professional billiards and snooker, whilst the International Billiards and Snooker Federation governs the amateur game.\nEngland.\nThe English Partnership for Snooker and Billiards has been the governing body for non-professional snooker in England since June 2019, when a resolution was passed by the English Association of Snooker and Billiards, the previous governing body, to transfer its assets and operations to the EPSB. The English Amateur Billiards Association governs amateur billiards."

When the tournament became an official conference championship the format was changed to a two-game point system where teams would receive 2 points for a win and one point for a tie. If the teams remained tied after two games then a 20-minute mini-game would be played to determine the winner. By NCAA regulations mini games do not count for team records or statistics.

        "text": "John Andrew Ferguson (born 4 April 1930) is a British water polo player. He spent his career playing for his hometown side Motherwell and competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics and the 1956 Summer Olympics. After retiring from playing, he coached the British national side for four years.\nAlongside water polo, Ferguson trained as a physical education teacher and worked for several schools in Scotland. He later became deputy director of physical education at the University of St Andrews.\nEarly life.\nFerguson was born in Motherwell to professional footballer Hughie Ferguson and his wife Jessie. His father committed suicide at Dens Park, the home ground of Dundee, in January 1930, three months before Ferguson's birth in April of the same year. Ferguson was the couple's third child; he has an older brother, Tom, and sister, Sadie. His sister later married James Hogg, also a footballer and the brother of Scottish international Bobby Hogg.\nAt the age of 5, Ferguson visited the Motherwell Baths where he developed a love of swimming. The Baths were run by David Crabb and Ferguson became part of the 'Tiny Tots', a groups of 4 to 8 years olds that performed swimming and diving routines in Crabb's Motherwell Water Circus around Britain.\nFerguson attended Dalziel Public School and Dalziel High School. He left the school hoping to pursue a career as a physical education teacher and attended the Scottish School of Physical Education in Jordanhill. There he gained a diploma in physical education. During his studies, he also competed for the school's gymnastics team and was part of the school's squad chosen to represent Britain at the Lingiad in Sweden in 1949.\nMilitary and teaching career.\nHaving graduated from the School of Physical Education, Ferguson worked in several schools before being appointed as a staff assistant at Hamilton Academy. However, his spell there was interrupted after he was called up for National Service. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a physical fitness officer. He later became the deputy director of physical education at the University of St Andrews where he worked until his retirement in 1990. In 2007, Ferguson was one of the inaugural inductees into the university's sports hall of fame.\nWater polo.\nFerguson was a keen swimmer from an early age after visiting the Motherwell Baths with his brother at the age of five. He took up water polo in the late 1940s and played as a forward. He captained the RAF team and trained the side to victory in an inter-services tournament against the other branches of the armed forces. He also scored the winning goal in the final of the 1949 Amateur Swimming Association water polo final, the only time the competition has been won by a team from outside England. He spent his career playing for Motherwell AC, with whom he won the Scottish Water Polo Cup 12 times in 13 attempts between 1947 and 1960.\nFerguson represented Britain at the 1952 Summer Olympics and the 1954 European Games. He was selected for the Olympics a second time for the 1956 summer games. The side opened with consecutive defeats against the United States and Hungary but won their remaining three matches to finish the competition in seventh place. As of May 2021, he remains the last Scotsman to represent Britain at the Olympics in water polo. After retiring from playing, Ferguson spent four years as the coach of the British national side."

In the fifth round, Walsh landed his second best throw, 22.56m.\nIn the final round, Kovacs stepped into the ring and tossed it , equalling Alessandro Andrei for the #3 thrower in history. More importantly, he took the lead. A couple of throws later, Crouser stepped in to throw his best to tie Walsh. Walsh fouled again. With his 22.71m second best throw, compared to 22.56m for Walsh, Crouser took second. In the space of 5 minutes, Walsh went from the #4 thrower in history, to third place in the competition. Romani's best throw of 22.53m would have been good enough to win the gold medal in every World and Olympic shot put competition prior to this championship, however it was not enough to secure even the bronze here as he finished in 4th place.\nThis has been called the greatest shot put competition in history.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 20.70 m.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 20.90 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 5 October at 20:05."

A full metre behind him was Fedrick Dacres and Lukas Weißhaidinger was a further two and a half metres behind him. That form held true in the qualifying round as Ståhl was the only automatic qualifier.\nAs the first thrower, Ståhl set the early standard with a 66.59m. Near the end of the round, Weißhaidinger answered with a 66.74m to take the first round lead. Starting the second round, Ståhl answered back with a 67.18m. Three throws later, Dacres joined the battle with a 66.94m, but that would turn out to be his best of the day. Three throws later Apostolos Parellis joined the 66 metre crowd for the first time adding 63 cm to his national record. The third round saw Ståhl lead off with the winner . Later Weißhaidinger improved his standing to 66.82m. And the last thrower Alin Firfirică displaced Parellis with a 66.46m. With three more rounds in the competition, none of the leaders would improve their position.

Aiken was hired as the University of Akron's head coach in 1936, and Miller followed him there a year later, playing from the school in 1937 and 1938. He holds Akron records for most interceptions in a season (13 in 1937) and in a game (6 vs. Baldwin Wallace in 1937). When Akron coach Jim Aiken was hired as head coach at the University of Nevada in 1939, he brought Miller with him. He sat out the 1939 season in order to become eligible to play, and served as Aiken's end coach. Miller starred as an end on the 1940 Nevada team, with Aiken deeming him \"the greatest end I've ever coached.\" Aiken hired Miller as his end coach in May 1946 after he had been an assistant coach for Lincoln High School in Canton, Ohio. When Aiken was hired as head coach at the University of Oregon in January 1947, he chose to bring Miller with him from Nevada to be line coach. In 1948, the athletic director from the University of North Dakota visited a coaching school in Oregon, and Miller was hired as the head football coach at the University of North Dakota in February 1949. He brought with him Frank Zazula, Oregon backfield coach as his assistant. He compiled a record of 4–3–1 before resigning in April 1950 to coach Canton McKinley High School in Ohio. Aiken offered Miller an assistant position at the University of Oregon in 1951, but Miller declined the offer. Miller's contract was not renewed after three seasons, compiling a 15-14-1 record while failing to defeat rival Massillon. \nPersonal life.\nMiller served as a Chief Petty Officer in the U.S. Navy during World War II.\nFollowing his departure from Canton McKinley, Miller became a teacher at Timken High School."

        "text": "Cricket in Bhutan, nicknamed The Dragons, represents the Kingdom of Bhutan in international cricket. The team is organised by the Bhutan Cricket Council Board, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2001.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Bhutan and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\nHistory.\nBhutan stayed confined for a considerable length of time, self-abstained and obscure to the remainder of the world. It is very surprising that Bhutan stayed free having been situated between the Asian mammoths India and China. Arrow based weaponry being the national game remained the most known and played game in the nation.\nAfter TV was acquainted with the nation during the 90s it advanced cricket, with the ICC Cricket World Cup in 1999 in England being displayed as the main significant occasion for the number of inhabitants in Bhutan. Inside no time eager cricket darlings ventured up in building up an affiliation and by 2001 the Bhutan Cricket Board were perceived by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and in 2003 turned into an individual from the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nBhutan Cricket Council Board became an affiliate member of the ICC in 2001. They made their ACC Trophy debut at the 2004 tournament, where they made the quarter finals.\nThey again competed at the ACC Trophy in 2006 but were eliminated in the first round after a series of heavy defeats. Their only win came against newcomers Myanmar.\nFollowing the 2006 ACC Trophy, the tournament was split into two divisions: Elite and Challenge. Bhutan took part in the 2009 ACC Trophy Challenge, where they were runners up. This result qualified them for the next ACC Trophy Elite as well as Division Eight of the World Cricket League.\nBhutan partook in its first worldwide competition in Nepal in 2003 and in 2004 Bhutan packed away its first universal success against Iran in the ACC Trophy held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, before at long last losing to Nepal in the quarter-finals.\nIn December 2011 took part in the ACC Twenty20 Cup in Nepal which served as qualifier for 2012 ICC World Twenty20."

        "title": "1991–92 Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1991–92 Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey team represented the Lake Superior State University in college ice hockey. In its 2nd year under head coach Jeff Jackson the team compiled a 30–9–4 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the sixth time. The Lakers defeated Wisconsin 5–3 to win the championship game at the Knickerbocker Arena in Albany, New York.\nSeason.\nAfter two consecutive 30+ win seasons Lake Superior was expected to take a step back. Losing its top five scorers from 1990–91, the formerly high-scoring Lakers would need to find a sway to get over the postseason hump that had seem them bow out in the national quarterfinals two years in a row. Stepping into the breach was freshman Brian Rolston, the 11th overall pick in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft and probably the most heralded prospect ever to appear in a Laker uniform. Also returning was the nations' top goaltender from the previous season, Darrin Madeley.\nGood start.\nIn their first five games Lake Superior looked to be just as impressive as they had been over the past two seasons, winning each game by an average of five goals. In those games, however, they weren't playing good teams. When the team took on defending national champion Northern Michigan in early November they earned a split in the home-and-home series. While they did acquit themselves well, losing the road game was the start of a pattern that would continue throughout the entire season.\nThe next weekend, at perennial power Michigan State, Madeley demonstrated that he was going to have another strong season by limiting the Spartans to a single goal in each game but LSSU could only manage a split after being shut out in the first game. Even when facing lowly Illinois–Chicago on the road, Lake Superior could only keep the weekends even. While their defensive game was strong, None of their players were particularly strong on offense; no Laker finished the season in the top 40 in scoring and the best points per game for Lake State was Sandy Moger's 1.21 ppg, good for 88th in the country.\nHome dominance.\nWhile the Lakers struggled to win on the road they were absolutely deadly at home. When eventual CCHA champion Michigan came to town in early December the Lakers earned a sweep in the series but did so with a 10–0 demolition of the Wolverines. Unfortunately, Lake Superior immediately surrendered that advantage with only 1 point against Miami the week after. Lake Superior was able to balance out their adequate road swings with stifling defense at home; only twice did the Lakers give up more than three goals at the Norris Center but timely offense allowed them to win both games.\nThe only blemish on their otherwise impeccable home record came from Michigan State. The Spartans took three points from LSSU in early February, the only two games in Sault Ste. Marie that the Lakers did not win. That poor home series also could not have come at a worse time; having lost both games at Michigan the week before Lake State was in a dogfight with their southern rivals for the top spot in the CCHA. With all three teams separated by just 3 points, the conference would be determined by how the final month of the season played out.\nDown to the wire.\nWhile Lake Superior and Michigan swept their respective weekends in mid-February, Michigan State could only manage a single point against lowly Bowling Green. The Lakers then earned a much-needed 3 points on the road against Western Michigan while the Wolverines all but ended the Spartans hopes with a sweep at the Joe Louis Arena. Michigan was now ahead of Lake State by 1 point with four games to play. With their next series against bottom-feeding Ohio State the Lakers had hopes that they could end their road woes but instead the team produced its worst defense efforts of the season, surrendering 15 goals in the two games and dropping five points behind the Wolverines, guaranteeing Michigan the CCHA championship. MSU, meanwhile, had recovered after their debacle at 'The Joe' and crept up into a tie with Lake State for second place. Not wanting to drop even further back, Lake Superior showed their mettle by taking both games against Western Michigan to finish one point ahead of the Spartans (who held the tie breaker) and lock up the second seed in the CCHA tournament.\nCCHA tournament.\nIn their final home games of the year, Lake Superior easily defeated Illinois–Chicago in the conference quarterfinals, winning twice before heading to Detroit. The semifinals saw them pitted against the Spartans but again, MSU failed in the Red Wings' building and the Lakers won the game 5–3. Michigan met them in the finals and were looking to avenge the championship loss from 1991. Tournament MVP Darrin Madeley stole the show, holding the conference's top offensive team to a single goal en route to the Laker's championship.\nNCAA tournament.\nWhile the CCHA crown guaranteed Lake Superior a spot in the NCAA tournament, it was not enough to earn them a bye into the quarterfinals. Lake Superior was given the third western seed, which would have allowed them to play at home in years past, but the NCAA tournament format had been changed for 1992. The first two rounds were now single-game elimination, like the championship rounds. With that came the ability create regional brackets with a single venue used as host. All games played by teams in the western regional were held at the Joe Louis Arena, a distinct advantage for CCHA teams. Lake Superior used that advantage and trounced Alaska–Anchorage in the quarterfinal. Two nights later they took on Minnesota, the team that led the nation in wins, and again dominated the competition with an 8–3 victory.\nShowing just how strong they were that year, Michigan, Michigan State and Lake Superior State all made the Frozen Four, the most the CCHA has ever produced. At least one of those teams would make the finals when MSU took on Lake State. The two squads battled to a 2–2 tie after two periods before Mark Astley scored the game winner midway through the third. LSSU's defense held the Spartans to six shots in the final frame and gave the Lakers their second championship appearance.\nControversial finish.\nWith only a surprising Wisconsin team standing in their way, the Lakers started the game well but soon found themselves down a goal. Wisconsin added a power play marker before the end of the first and Lake Superior, who had had trouble scoring at times during the season, were hoping that the game wasn't already out of hand. Rather than the game being remembered for performances by players, however, referee Tim McConaghy called an inordinate amount of penalties in the game. Many in attendance had difficulty in understanding the calls and things went from bad to worse when the Badgers' captain Doug MacDonald was given a 10-minute misconduct for questioning the calls. While the Lakers were hit for 10 penalties in the game, Wisconsin players headed to the box 15 times and Lake Superior managed to use the disproportionate advantages to even the game after 40 minutes.\nMichael Smith scored early in the third to give the Lakers their first lead of the game but a power play goal by Jason Zent tied the game at 3-all. Just after the fifteen-minute mark Brian Rolston scored to put Lake State up 4–3 and Wisconsin began a furious attempt to come back. With three minutes to play Blaine Moore was charged with elbowing to the obvious frustration of the Badgers. Wisconsin was forced to pull their goaltender but an empty-net goal by Jay Ness salted away the game and gave Lake Superior their second national championship.\nThe Lakers had outshot Wisconsin 37–27 in the game while both teams scored twice on the power play, but the enduring legacy from the match was a confrontation between McConaghy and Wisconsin team members after the game. The ugly incident would eventually lead to three separate suspensions, a sour finish for what should have been a Lake Superior triumph.\nTo make matters worse, Wisconsin's participation was later vacated for unrelated violations by team members leaving the 1992 championship one of the most mired in controversy in NCAA history.\nAwards and honors.\nRegardless of Wisconsin's response, Paul Constantin, who had started the laker's comeback in the second period, was named the tournament MOP and joined Darrin Madeley, Mark Astley and Brian Rolston on the All-Tournament team. For the second year in a row Madeley possessed the best goals against average in the nation, posting the best numbers for any qualifying goalie in seven years. His stellar play earn him an AHCA First-Team All-American spot along with Astley.\nBoth Madeley and Astley were on the All-CCHA First Team while Steve Barnes and Sandy Moger made the second team. Astley was also named as the Best Offensive Defenseman in the CCHA.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nPlayers drafted into the NHL.\n1992 NHL Entry Draft.\nNo Lakers were selected in the 1992 NHL Draft."

Bahrain's Rose Chelimo was second in 2:33.46, with Helalia Johannes of Namibia third in 2:34.15.\nThe marathon was held on Doha Corniche, and consisted of six laps of a roughly floodlit course. A group of six runners broke away during the first half of the race; Chepngetich, Chelimo, Johannes, Lonah Salpeter, Edna Kiplagat, and Visiline Jepkesho. Salpeter and Jepkesho dropped back, reducing the leading group to four, and then Chepngetich and Chelimo vied for the lead. At the start of the final lap, Chepngetich opened a gap at the front, eventually winning by over a minute. All the top ten finishers qualified automatically for the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nQualification.\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF, now World Athletics) announced the qualifying criteria for the 2019 World Athletics Championships in December 2018. For the women's marathon, the entry standard was 2:37:00, eight minutes quicker than had been required for the 2017 marathon. Alternatively, a top-10 finish at an IAAF Gold Label marathon, or a wild card entry as the reigning world champion would ensure qualification. Entry criteria had to be met during the qualification period: 7 March 2018 to 6 September 2019, inclusive.\nPreview.\nDue to the hot conditions in Doha, the World Championships were scheduled in October, rather than the traditional August, and rather than holding the marathon during the day, it started at midnight local time to minimise the impact that the heat would have on the race, making it the first-ever night marathon at the World Championships. Despite these changes, the temperature was expected to be a key factor in the race: temperatures were predicted to be around , with humidity levels above 80 per cent. In mitigation, the IAAF added extra water stations and medical staff along the route, as well as more ice baths at the finish. The course consisted of six laps of a floodlit roughly course along the Doha Corniche, a waterfront promenade on Doha Bay. The loop started in front of the Amiri Diwan, and stretched to the Sheraton Hotel.\nAthletes from Bahrain, Ethiopia and Kenya were considered the favourites to win. Bahrain's Rose Chelimo had won in 2017, but two of her teammates had run quicker in 2019: Desi Mokonin and Shitaye Eshete. Ruth Chepngetich of Kenya held the world-leading time for 2019: 2:17:08 in Dubai in January. Other entrants included Lonah Salpeter of Israel, who had won gold in the 10,000 metres at the 2018 European Championships, and Helalia Johannes of Namibia, who had won the marathon at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in hot conditions. On the day leading up to the race, two of the 70 entrants withdrew: Great Britain's Tish Jones was suffering with a muscle injury in her leg, while Nikolina Šustić of Croatia had suspected food poisoning.\nBoth the high temperatures, and the tactical nature of World Championship races, meant that it was not expected that any records would be set. Paula Radcliffe held the World Championship record of 2:20:57 achieved in 2005, while Mary Keitany held the overall women's world record (in women only races) of 2:17:01, set during the 2017 London Marathon.\nSummary.\nThe race was officially scheduled to start at 23:59 local time (UTC+3) on 27 September 2019; temperatures were higher than expected, at and 73 per cent humidity. At the start of the race, Sardana Trofimova, a Russian runner cleared by the IAAF to run as an \"Authorised Neutral Athlete\", led the field. Around into the race, which had 68 starters, a small pack broke away at the front, featuring Chepngetich, Chelimo, Salpeter, Edna Kiplagat, Visiline Jepkesho and Helalia Johannes. Chepngetich attempted to break away at the point, but she was soon caught again. Salpeter dropped back from the group, and fell away to around a minute behind them. By the halfway stage, 16 of the 68 starters had pulled out. Salpeter began closing the gap on the leading group, and was back within eleven seconds when she collapsed and had to withdraw from the race. Some of the athletes dropping out required medical attention: Sara Dossena of Italy needed a wheelchair, while Uganda's Linet Toroitich Chebet had to be taken away by an ambulance. All three of Ethiopia's athletes withdrew: their coach, Haji Adillo Roba, said, \"We never would have run a marathon in these conditions in our own country.\"\nThe leading group was reduced to four when Jepkesho fell back, and later Chepngetich and Chelimo moved away at the front. At the start of the final lap, Chepngetich was able to break away and opened up a gap to claim the gold medal. Her time of 2:32:43 was the slowest ever winning time at the World Championships. She finished just over a minute ahead of Chelimo, 2:33.46, while Johannes claimed the bronze medal in a time of 2:34.15. Only 40 of the 68 runners finished the race; and there were criticisms from many of the participants. Volha Mazuronak, who finished fifth, said \"It's disrespect towards the athletes. A bunch of high-ranked officials gathered and decided that it would take [the World Championships] here but they are sitting in the cool and they are probably sleeping right now.\" Roberta Groner, who was one place further back, said \"The key was to finish and not hurt myself.\" Lyndsay Tessier had similar sentiments: \"It was really scary and intimidating and daunting. I'm just really grateful to have finished standing up.\"\nLater in the day, the IAAF published a statement saying that no athletes had suffered heat stroke as a result of the race, and that the completion rate was similar to that seen in Tokyo in 1991 and Moscow in 2013. In total, they said that \"Thirty athletes visited the Medical Centre as a precaution. A small number were kept under observation and one athlete was referred to the hospital for observation but later released.\"\nResults.\nThe final took place on 27 September at 23:59. The results were as follows:"

        "title": "1925 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1925 season of Auckland Rugby League was its 16th. On 30 March Auckland Rugby League held its fifteenth annual meeting with 200 in attendance. The strong financial position of the league was commented on. It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.\n \n \nAuckland Rugby League news.\nTrophy winners.\nCity Rovers won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. Ponsonby won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final in its inaugural season.\nWhile in the B division Ellerslie won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup. It was won by Otahuhu who defeated Northcote in the final.\nIn the lower grades Richmond Rovers dominated like they were to come to do for many seasons. They won the 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and both sections of the 6th grade. They were a very powerful club at the junior level and this would ultimately lead to great success at the senior grade level.\nRepresentative season.\nThe Auckland team played in 5 matches with a number of other Auckland B and Auckland C team matches. They played against the New Zealand team twice and the touring Queensland side who they drew with 18 all. The Auckland side claimed the Northern Union Challenge Cup off the holders, South Auckland and they retained it against the same opponents in a later match. In addition the Auckland Provincial team played Queensland but were soundly beaten 54–14.\nDeath of Bill Stormont and inauguration of the Stormont Shield.\nOn 4 June William Stormont (known better as Bill Stormont) died, succumbing to rheumatic heart disease. Stormont had played for the Marist Old Boys senior team from 1920 to 1924 scoring 24 tries and kicking 31 goals. He had also represented Auckland on 16 occasions, scoring 4 tries and kicking 2 goals as well as playing 3 matches for New Zealand in 1920. He had been ill for quite some time and had not played for Marist since the end of the 1924 season. The funeral was on the Sunday leaving his parents residence in Epsom and progressing to Purewa Cemetery where he was buried. The match between Marist and Richmond Rovers on Saturday was originally postponed but was never played. The matches at Carlaw Park saw one minutes silence before kickoff. On 9 July at the New Zealand Council meeting John Stormont presented a shield to be played for among the senior clubs. It was to be known as the “William Stormont Memorial Shield”.\nOn 22 July at an Auckland Management Committee meeting it was decided that the shield would be played for by the “winners of the senior grade club competition and the winners of the Roope Rooster”. A request came in for the trophy to be played for among champion teams from around the country but it was eventually settled that it would be for Auckland teams. The championship winning City Rovers team, the Roope Rooster winning Ponsonby United, and Stormont's Marist side were the three teams chosen to compete for it. City drew the bye so Ponsonby were to come up against Marist in the ‘semi-final’ match. Ponsonby defeated Marist 23–22 to progress to the Stormont Shield final. Ponsonby then trounced City Rovers 35–3 in the final to become the first team with their name on the trophy. The Stormont Shield is still played for today though it is played for in round 1 of the regular season with the Fox Memorial grand finalists from the previous year competing for it.\nMonteith Shield (first grade championship).\nMonteith Shield fixtures.\nPrior to the kickoff in the Round 7 games at Carlaw Park on 6 June, the teams stood in silence for one minute as a mark of respect for the late William Stormont who had died two days earlier. He was a World War I veteran and had played for Marist from 1920 to 1924.\nRound 4.\nSam Lowrie was ordered off in the match between Ponsonby and Devonport.\nRound 7.\nThe match between Marist and Richmond scheduled to be played at Victoria Park was cancelled due to the death of recent Marist player Bill Stormont two days earlier.\nRound 9.\nJim O'Brien for Marist and Tom Haddon for Devonport were ordered off for fighting in their match at Carlaw Park.\nIn one of the more amazing team efforts in early Auckland rugby league history the City team saw all 13 of its players score points in a 57–10 victory over Athletic. There were nine different try scorers and the four who didn't cross the line all kicked at least one conversion. The match perhaps somewhat anti-climatically took place on the number 2 field. There were 9,000 in attendance at Carlaw Park but the majority would have been watching the match on the number 1 field at the time where Marist beat Devonport 19-11. The Ponsonby v Richmond meanwhile was played at the Auckland Domain.\nB Grade standings and results.\nB Grade fixtures.\nIn Kingsland's debut in the grade Claude List in his debut season in first grade scored 3 tries in their win over Northcote. He repeated the feat 2 weeks later against Mangere. He would later become the first ever player to represent New Zealand whilst playing for ostensibly a 'second grade' team.\nThe round 15 match between Kingsland and Otahuhu was not played due to the poor condition of the field at the Auckland Domain.\nStallard Cup knockout competition.\nThis was the first season with a B Division in the First Grade competition and at the end of the season a knockout competition was played between the five teams.\nFinal.\nThe match was played as curtain raiser to the New Zealand game against Queensland.\nLower grades.\nThere were 6 lower grade competitions in 1925 below the B Division with the 6th grade split into an A and B division.\nSecond grade.\nRichmond defeated Ponsonby A 15-3 on 5 September of the championship final. Ponsonby B beat Richmond 14-5 in the knockout final on 10 October. Ellerslie and Kingsland withdrew after 4 rounds, United Suburbs after 5 rounds, and City after 7 rounds.\nThird grade.\nThe 1933 Third Grade competition had 17 teams entered which was the largest for any grade in the history of Auckland Rugby League to this point. City Rovers secured the championship when they defeated Ponsonby B on 19 September in round 18. They played Northcote in the knockout final on 3 October but no result was reported. Otahuhu withdrew from the competition after a round 8 default, while Coromandel Old Boys withdrew after round 10.\nFourth grade.\nRichmond Rovers won the competition undefeated. When they secured the title on 19 September they were a full 6 points clear of their nearest rival according to newspaper reports. Parnell were second and it is likely that they won more matches than the 10 that were reported. City withdrew after 1 round as did New Lynn and Newton B after 2 rounds so they have not been included in the standings, and Marist B after 4 rounds. There were many results that were unreported so the table is incomplete. Richmond beat Athletic in the knockout final on 10 October by 5 points to 3.\nFifth grade.\nRichmond won the championship for the second time. The result was not reported in the newspapers but did appear in the Rugby League Annual of 1949 written by Bill Davidson. City won the knockout final 16 to 13 on 10 October over Parnell. Parnell had defeated Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers 9 to 3 in one semi final, while City defeated Marist in the other by 24 to 5. Athletic withdrew after 12 rounds. Newton entered a team but it is unknown if they played a match as they withdrew after round one.\nSixth grade A.\nRichmond won the championship with an undefeated season. They also won the knockout competition when they beat Devonport 8 to 0 in the final on 19 September. Marist withdrew from the competition after 2 rounds. Less than half of the results were reported in the newspapers so the standings are incomplete. It appears that Leys Institute were affiliated to the Ponsonby club as they were usually reported as Leys Institute in the official fixture lists on Thursdays in the newspapers but as Ponsonby by the newspapers on Monday when they reported scores.\nSixth grade B.\nRichmond A won the championship. They also won the knockout competition when they beat United Suburbs who had joined the competition late in the season by 32 points to 0. A large number of match results were not reported so the standings are incomplete.\nExhibition matches.\nOn 19 April, when Marist had a bye in the first round of the club competition they travelled to Christchurch and played Marist of Christchurch. They won by 16 points to 7. The match also marked the opening of Monica Park.\nRepresentative season.\nThe Auckland representative team had a busy season. After a series of 3 trial matches on 27 June both the New Zealand team and Auckland teams were selected. Officials had declared that \"give us fine weather and we will get an attendance of 20,000\". Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9. Auckland then played against the New Zealand team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of Australia they again played Auckland at Carlaw Park and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played Queensland who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: Craddock Dufty, Charles Gregory, Lou Brown, Hec Brisbane, Frank Delgrosso, Jack Kirwan, Bert Laing, Maurice Wetherill, Wilson Hall, Stan Webb, Bert Avery, Ernie Herring, Jim O'Brien, and Horace Dixon. The following day Sam Lowrie of Ponsonby United was added to the touring side.\nAuckland v Queensland.\nIn the match reports the newspapers did not distinguish between the two Jim O'Brien's. It is more likely that the try scored was by Jim O'Brien purely because he was playing in the second row (despite often playing at prop) and was more involved in the loose play which the try itself came from. The try came after a kick was chased by Maurice Wetherill.\nAuckland v South Auckland (Northern Union C.C.).\nClaude List became the first player selected from the B Division to make the full Auckland representative side. He played for the Kingsland Rovers club and had been mentioned as being as good as any player in his position in New Zealand rugby league. He was to go on to represent New Zealand from 1928 to 1932 and play senior club football into the 1940s.\nAuckland Province v Queensland.\nShortly before halftime Stan Rayner was carried from the field on a stretcher and replaced by Bill Te Whata.\nAuckland representative matches played and scorers.\nThis list only includes the Auckland team games and does not include the Auckland B, Auckland C, and Auckland Province matches."

        "title": "1990–91 Northern Michigan Wildcats men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1990–91 Northern Michigan Wildcats men's ice hockey team represented Northern Michigan University (NMU) in college ice hockey. In its 15th year under head coach Rick Comley, the team compiled a 38–5–4 record. The Wildcats won the 1991 national championship, their first national title.\nSeason.\nNorthern Michigan was looking to bounce back after a disappointing season. Getting star defenseman Brad Werenka back from injury, now in his fifth year, was a big help. The maturation of sophomores Scott Beattie and Jim Hiller would provide a scoring punch that led the nation but, most importantly, starting goaltender Bill Pye recovered from a poor 1989–90 season.\nScoring early and often.\nFrom the start of the season it was apparent that the Wildcats had one of the best offenses in the nation. Their scoring prowess, combined with playing seven consecutive games at home, allowed NMU to get off to an 8–0–1 start. Their winning streak ended when they hit the road to play Minnesota; without the advantage of the Lakeview Arena crowd NMU took only 1 point over the weekend and allowed the Gophers to take the top spot in the WCHA standings.\nRoad woes.\nNorthern Michigan followed up their first loss of the season with a visit to the east, taking on Hockey East powerhouse Maine. The Black Bears shut down the high-flying Wildcat offense, holding NMU to three goals in two games. After the pair of losses, NMU returned home to face nearby rival Michigan Tech and were able to right the ship with two wins in the home-and-home series. Two weeks later NMU headed to North Dakota to take on the Fighting Sioux in a vert important series. Though the scores were close, NMU won both games, putting them ahead of Minnesota, who was busy playing non-conference games. After the big win the Wildcats had a letdown against St. Cloud State, a program that had just joined the WCHA, losing both road games to the Huskies. NMU had a one-point lead in the conference standings but Minnesota had two games in hand and it looked like the two teams would fight for the MacNaughton Cup all the way to the finish.\nUnbeaten streak.\nWith 10 of their next 14 games at home, NMU saw an opportunity to make a run at their first WCHA title. After utterly dominating Ohio State in a non-conference matchup, the Wildcats swept Colorado College before taking three points on road against Minnesota–Duluth. NMU got their revenge against St. Cloud with a pair of home wins, then headed to Colorado to face Denver where the porous defense gave Northern Michigan their biggest scoring weekend of the season with 20 goals in two games. NMU would end the season with a program-record 26-game unbeaten streak and extended that mark to 30 games in the following campaign.\nWCHA showdown.\nBy the end of January, Northern Michigan and Minnesota were tied atop of the conference standings with identical 20–3–3 records. While NMU hosted non-conference Bowling Green, Minnesota took on Minnesota–Duluth and could only manage a single point in two games. The two teams headed for a clash of the WCHA titans in Marquette with the Gophers up by a point while Northern Michigan had two games in hand, a reversal of situation back in December. The teams fought to a 3–3 tie in the first game but the Wildcats offense broke through in the second match, giving NMU a much needed win and the lead in the WCHA standings.\nWhile Minnesota licked its wounds with a week off, NMU faced MTU for their second home-and-home. The Huskies were no match for the Wildcats, and with the two wins, NMU won the MacNaughton Cup with two games to spare. The conference title all but guaranteed Northern Michigan a spot in the NCAA Tournament but, when they headed to Wisconsin and won both games against the defending national champion Badgers, Northern Michigan showed they weren't going to rest on their laurels.\nWCHA tournament.\nNMU took on Colorado College in the quarterfinals and used the Tigers as a proverbial punching bag. While the Wildcats scored 13 goals in the two games, Bill Pye got his fourth shutout of the season, a new program record. After dropping North Dakota in the semifinal, NMU faced Minnesota for the championship. Prior to the game the NCAA had already announced the seeding for the NCAA tournament and Northern Michigan was given the second western slot. Despite being guaranteed a first round bye, the Wildcats weren't distracted by their good fortune and held the Gophers back, winning the close affair 4–2 with an empty net goal to seal the match. Bill Pye was named the Tournament MVP, and is the only player in history to win the award more than once (as of 2019).\nNCAA tournament.\nWith a week of to rest and prepare for the quarterfinals, Northern Michigan was gearing up to face Boston College but, surprisingly, the Eagles were upset in the first round by Alaska–Anchorage. When the Seawolves arrived at Marquette, Northern Michigan expected to run roughshod over the unheralded team. Early in the first game it appeared they were going to do just that but after building a 3-goal lead UAA scored the next two to give NMU a challenge. Anchorage did everything in their power to win the game but the Wildcat offense was just too powerful, and Northern Michigan took the first game 8–5. It was a similar case in the second game and when the dust settled NMU won the game 5–3 and advanced to the Frozen Four. The two wins against Alaska–Anchorage saw two more program records set; the first win was Northern Michigan's 35th of the season, breaking the mark set by the 1980 team, while the rematch saw Bill Pye winning his 30th game of the year, breaking Steve Weeks' previous record, also set in 1980.\nIn the national semifinal NMU took on a familiar foe in Maine. The top eastern team had easily dispatched Minnesota in their quarterfinal and were looking for a repeat performance from December but this time the Wildcats were ready for the stifling Black Bear defense. In front of a mostly favorable crowd, Northern Michigan outlasted Maine by scoring 4 of the last 5 goals and winning 5–3 to advance to their second championship game.\nNational championship.\nWith one game left, only Boston University stood in the way of NMU's first national championship. From the start the two teams seemed evenly matched but in the first the puck bounced in BU's favor and the Terriers scored three times to build a big lead. The Wildcats headed into the locker room worried about their deficit but as the nation's top offense, scoring was one thing they knew they could do. One of the four team captains, Dean Antos finally got NMU on the board in the second period and the team took off. In what head coach Rick Comley would later call their best period of the season, Northern Michigan scored five unanswered goals in middle frame to take a 5–3 lead after 40 minutes.\nComley's counterpart, Jack Parker, responded to the turn of events by replacing his goaltender at for the third. The initial result was poor as Scott Beattie scored his third goal of the game to open the period. BU finally responded with a goal from a falling Dave Thomlinson but Darryl Plandowski's second of the night gave NMU back their three-goal lead. With less than 12 minutes remaining, the Wildcats started to believe they were going to win the national championship but BU kept coming. In a short span Tony Amonte and Shawn McEachern scored, with each assisting on the other's goal, to cut the lead down to one. Northern Michigan tightened up defensively and kept the Terriers off the scoresheet until 39 seconds when Dave Sacco chipped the puck into the net with the goaltender pulled. With their lead evaporated, NMU nearly lost the game outright with seconds to play but Bill Pye snagged a shot from Amonte out of the air and keep the game tied.\nIn the overtime session Northern Michigan seemed to regain its focus and continued to fire the puck on goal but couldn't find the back of the net. Disaster nearly struck the Wildcats when Kevin O'Sullivan got free in the left circle and fired a shot that eluded Bill Pye's right pad and hit the post behind him. The puck deflected across the front of the net then bounced right to BU's leading scorer, Shawn McEachern, who had to hurry a shot at a nearly open net. Rather than hit the twine the puck struck the same post yet again, slid all the way across the goal line and bounced off Brad Werenka's skate back in front of the net where Pye was finally able to cover it before it entered the net. Not to be outdone, off of the ensuing faceoff, Northern Michigan's Tony Szabo hit the crossbar with a slapshot leaving both teams feeling fortunate for the close misses.\nThe chances kept coming in the second 10-minute overtime session but both goaltenders stood tall. In took a third overtime before a team would break the tie and just under two minutes in Mark Beaufait grabbed the puck after a drop pass from Plandowski and skated towards the left circle. Two BU players followed Beaufait as he headed for the goal line, allowing Plandowski to skate unchecked into the slot. Right when he got to the goal line, Beaufait extended his stick as far in front of him as he could and slipped the puck around a sliding defender right to Plandowski. BU's goaltender, Scott Cashman, had over played Beaufait and left the net essentially vacated so when Plandowski shot the puck there was no one there to stop it and NMU's eighth goal of the night ended one of craziest games in NCAA history.\nBeattie and Plandowski became the first two players to score hat-tricks in the same NCAA championship game, a feat that has not been repeated since (as of 2019).\nAwards and honors.\nScott Beattie was named as the Tournament MOP and his hat-trick in the finale gave him the program record for goals in a season (48). Beattie was joined on the All-Tournament Team by teammates Bill Pye, Lou Melone and Brad Werenka. Beattie's 89 points led both his team and the nation in scoring, becoming NMU's first (and only as of 2019) NCAA Scoring champion. Rick Comley's team posted a program record 38 wins, tied for the 3rd-highest total ever (as of 2019) and received the Spencer Penrose Award as the national coach of the year.\nBrad Werenka set a program record for goals, assists and points in a season by a defenseman (20, 43 and 63 respectively) and was named to the All-American West First Team along with Beattie. Bill Pye's program-record 32 wins led the nation and he was a Second Team All-American.\nNMU's dominance throughout the season was recognized with a clean sweep of the individual WCHA awards: Scott Beattie was named Most Valuable Player, Tony Szabo received the Rookie of the Year, Werenka was awarded the Student-Athlete of the Year and Rick Comley got his second Coach of the Year Award. Beattie, Werenka and Pye were all named to the All-WCHA First Team. while Szabo made the inaugural conference Rookie team.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Feitor was only 16 at her first appearance, Vieira was 23 at his.\nBased on the previous evening's marathon, the desert heat was going to affect the outcome. This race too started at midnight in order to avoid the heat of the day in Doha, that would mean temperatures hovered around 32 °C 90 °F throughout the race. Most walkers were wary of starting too fast, only 20K world record holder Yusuke Suzuki went out fast, opening up a gap just a few minutes into the race. By 5K he had a 10 second lead over a chase pack of only four others, including the world record holder and defending champion Yohann Diniz and Olympic champion Matej Tóth, the rest of the field was 37 seconds or more back. As they were approaching 10K, Diniz decided the man who had taken his 20K world record was too serious a challenger to his title and bridged the ever growing gap. That extra effort didn't last too long before Diniz was sliding back through the field. Diniz eventually dropped out. By 15K, Suzuki had 45 seconds over Tóth and Isaac Palma, the rest of the peloton almost 1:20 back. At 20K, he had over 2 minutes as Tóth and Palma dropped back. Neither would finish. At the half way point, Suzuki had over 3 minutes against new leaders of the chase pack.\nLuo Yadong and Niu Wenbin teamed up to try to bridge the gap, Luo getting barely under 3 minutes back by 30K, but by 35K Suzuki had opened up 3:34. As Luo dropped back through the field, the next racer behind Niu was Vieira, still over 4:30 back with 10K to go. Suzuki first showed signs of cracking, stopping at the water station at 44K before getting back on stride. At that point he still had two minutes on Niu, an additional minute on Vieira with the next chaser Evan Dunfee another minute back, now ahead of Luo. Niu had his second red card and was on the edge of disqualification. He couldn't push. One 2K lap later, Suzuki stopped again at the water station and again one lap later. Still with a huge lead, Suzuki struggled through the final lap while Vieira and Dunfee were applying the pressure. Both passed Niu, with Dunfee closing down his gap to Vieira. Suzuki got across the finish line first, only 39 seconds ahead of Vieira, who held off Dunfee by only 3 seconds.\nAt age 43, Vieira became the oldest medalist. Suzuki's winning time of 4:04:20 was the slowest winning time in the event's history dating back to 1976 by almost 10 minutes. Of 46 starters, 14 dropped out and an additional four were disqualified. 35 minutes after the last competitor crossed the line, it was sunrise in Doha.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nThe final was started at 23:30."

The tour consisted of three Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs), which formed part of the 2017–20 ICC Women's Championship, and five Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) matches. India won the WODI series 2–1. In the WT20I series, India won the first three matches, to take an unassailable lead. India then went on to win the remaining two fixtures, to sweep the series 5–0.\nSquads.\nChinelle Henry was ruled out of the second and third WODIs, due to a concussion, and was replaced by Hayley Matthews in the West Indies squad. Matthews was eligible to play for the West Indies, after serving an eight-match suspension. Ahead of the second WODI match, Caneisha Isaac was added to the West Indies squad, replacing Britney Cooper, after Cooper suffered a bruised shin. Stafanie Taylor was initially named as the captain of the West Indies' WT20I squad. However, she suffered a ligament sprain and was ruled out of the series, with Cherry-Ann Fraser added to the squad. Anisa Mohammed replaced Taylor as captain for the WT20I matches."

This was the 27th season of Division III college ice hockey.\nConference and rule changes.\nThe NCAA began offering automatic bids for conference tournament champions for the first time. Partly due to this development, ECAC East split into two conferences when the NESCAC began sponsoring ice hockey as a sport and the 9 existing programs left ECAC East to form the new league. Each team in the ECAC East and NESCAC played one another in one game that counted in their respective conference standings.\nBecause the NESCAC now sponsored ice hockey as a varsity sport, the conference dropped the policy that allowed member schools to play in only one postseason tournament. Member teams could now play in both the conference tournament and the national tournament.\nDespite the dissolution of the Division II Tournament, five eastern teams continued to compete as Division II programs. After the regular season, they held an ECAC Division II Tournament rather than compete in their respective conference tournaments.\nMinnesota–Crookston joined the MCHA, despite being a Division II program, and met conference guidelines by not offering scholarships to any players."

He played for his school team and the University of Nottingham before joining the England and Great Britain teams. Land was a member of the team that competed at the 1964 Summer Olympics. In later life he returned to hockey, playing for England at over 60s, over 65s, over 70s and over 75s level. Land supported the growth of the sport in the north of England and was president of the North Hockey Association in 2006.\nBiography.\nJohn Land was born on 17 July 1938 to Magnus and Alice Land. His father, a Royal Navy sailor, was lost at sea and presumed drowned in 1939. As a child Land played a number of sports and was a member of his school's field hockey first eleven. He studied at the University of Nottingham, graduating with a degree in metallurgy in 1962. Land played field hockey for the university between 1959 and 1961, one of the most successful periods for the sport at the university, including a period as team captain.\nLand played for the England and Great Britain field hockey teams in the 1960s. He was recognised as being exceptionally quick on the field. He competed in the men's tournament at the 1964 Summer Olympics. Land was from the north of England and at this time it was unusual for players from outside southern England to be selected for the team.\nIn later life Land returned to hockey, competing for England at Masters level. He won gold medals with the over 60s, over 65s and over 70s teams and also played for the over 75s. He worked with the North Hockey Association to promote masters hockey in the north of England. His support helped to establish North sides that compete at the over 60s, 65s and 70s levels (and have won gold in the latter two categories). He was president of the association in 2006. He also supported the LX Club and Sunderland hockey teams.\nLand was married to Julie and had three children. He was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2015 and died on 6 January 2021."

        "text": "The women's 10,000 metres at the World Athletics Championships was held at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, Qatar, on 28 September 2019.\nSummary.\nAt the beginning, none of the favorites wanted to lead the race, so leading duties fell on Alina Reh to keep the pace honest, 9:29.69 for the 3000 metres. A lap later, #3 Kenyan Rosemary Wanjiru accelerated. The field strung out. Her teammates Hellen Obiri and Agnes Tirop followed. If it was a sacrificial tactic, the Ethiopian team took the bait. Letesenbet Gidey, Netsanet Gudeta and Senbere Teferi came forward in chase of the breakaway. The only other athlete to join the lead group was Sifan Hassan, who took a little more than a lap to bridge the gap from the back of the pack. The Kenyan team shared the leading duties, pushing the pace down to 15:32:70. Gudeta couldn't keep up with the fast pace, eventually dropping out. The Kenyan efforts kept driving the train until 4 laps to go when World leader Gidey quickly accelerated to the lead. The Kenyans struggled to keep up, again late to bridge the gap, Hassan went around the Kenyan team to catch Gidey just before the bell. Running around lapped runners, Hassan extended the gap to win by 3.5 seconds in 30:17.62. Tirop held on for bronze.\nHassan was running only her second 10,000 ever; her first being her qualifying run at Stanford. Her only other experience at the distance was a 34:28 road 10K from 2012. The first 5 were the fastest 5 times of the season. Excepting Teferi, it was personal bests for the first 8 and 11 total in the race. 42 year old Sinead Diver's personal best turned out to be the W40 Masters World Record.\nAfter setting the world record in the Mile, the 1500 was the primary target for Hassan. A week later, she completed the double a week later. Hassan had previously attempted doubles at the Olympics and previous two World Championships, even picking up a bronze medal in the 5000 in 2017. With a lack of success at 800 metres and the 5000 scheduled on same nights as the 1500, the odd 10,000/1500 double has never previously been accomplished at this level. Only Paavo Nurmi has gold medals in both events and his were in different Olympiads.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition, the records were as follows:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 21:10."

        "text": "A three-point field goal (also known as a \"three-pointer\" or \"3-pointer\") is a field goal in a basketball game, made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc radiating from the basket. A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made inside the three-point line. The members on this list are the top 25 in 3-point field goals made in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I women's competition. The statistic was first recognized in the 1987–88 season, when 3-point field goals were officially instituted by the NCAA for women's play. From the 1987–88 season through the 2007–08 season, the three-point perimeter was marked at for both men's and women's college basketball. On May 3, 2007, the NCAA men's basketball rules committee passed a measure to extend the distance of the men's three-point line back to ; the women's line remained at the original distance until it was moved to match the then-current men's distance effective in 2011–12. On June 5, 2019, the NCAA men's rules committee voted to extend the men's three-point line to the FIBA distance of , effective in 2019–20 in Division I and 2020–21 in lower NCAA divisions. The women's line remained at 20 ft 9 in until being moved to the FIBA arc in 2021–22.\nThrough the 2023–24 season, Caitlin Clark holds the records for career threes and three-point attempts, having made 548 from 1,452 attempts during her career at Iowa from 2020 to 2024.\nSeven players on this list played in more than the standard four seasons due to benefiting from the NCAA's blanket COVID-19 eligibility waiver for players active in the 2020–21 season—Taylor Robertson, Kendall Spray, Katie Benzan, Dyaisha Fair, Taycee Wedin, Taylor Mikesell, and Aisha Sheppard. All played in five seasons.\nFour players on this list split their collegiate careers between two or more schools. Spray played at UT Martin, Clemson, and Florida Gulf Coast. Benzan played at Harvard and Maryland. Fair played at Buffalo and Syracuse. Mikesell also played at Maryland before transferring to Oregon and later Ohio State. \nThe player with the highest three-point percentage for her career on this list is Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis of UConn at 44.7%, while Shrieka Evans of Grambling has the lowest at 31.9%.\nFive programs have placed two players in the all-time top 25—Ohio State with Mitchell and Mikesell, Idaho with Taylor Pierce and Mikayla Ferenz, UT Martin with Spray and Heather Butler, Maryland with Benzan and Mikesell, and UConn with Mosqueda-Lewis and Katie Lou Samuelson.\nTop 25 3-point field goal leaders.\nCurrent through the end of the 2023–24 season."

        "title": "Sunday Afternoon Baseball",
        "text": "Sunday Afternoon Baseball is the de facto branding used for nationally televised live game telecasts of Major League Baseball games on Sunday afternoons during the regular season.\nHistory.\nEarly versions (1958–1964).\nThe first Sunday afternoon broadcasts of Major League Baseball occurred in 1958 when CBS added a Sunday \"Game of the Week\". Two years later, NBC launched their own Sunday telecasts to go with their Saturday afternoon \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts.\nIn 1962, CBS dropped the Sunday baseball \"Game of the Week\" once the NFL season started, dropping the option clause for affiliates to carry baseball or football in place since 1957. NBC's Sunday afternoon telecasts would last through the end of the 1964 season.\nABC's Sunday afternoon coverage (1977-1987).\nIn , the start of ABC's \"Monday Night Baseball\" coverage was moved back to June, due to poor ratings during the May sweeps period. In place of April and May prime time games, ABC began airing \"Sunday Afternoon Baseball\" games in September. ABC also had a clause where they could air a game the last day of the regular season if it had playoff implications, such as in 1987 in regards to the Detroit Tigers' American League East pennant chase against the Toronto Blue Jays. The team of Michaels, Palmer, and McCarver called that game in Detroit that day, in which the Tigers clinched the American League East crown. However, in 1986, ABC did do a number of early season Sunday afternoon games before they went into \"Monday Night Baseball\". ABC's contract was further modified prior to the season, with the network airing just five \"Monday Night Baseball\" telecasts in June of that year, followed by \"Sunday Afternoon Baseball\" in August and September. ABC did Sunday afternoon games late in the season in order to fulfill the number of games in the contract and to not interfere with \"Monday Night Football\".\nIn , ABC planned to increase coverage to 10 Monday night games and eight Sunday afternoon games, but the players' strike that year ended up reducing the network's schedule to three Monday night and seven Sunday afternoon telecasts.\nOn April 7, 1983, Major League Baseball, ABC, and NBC agreed to terms of a six-year television package worth $1.2 billion. The two networks continued to alternate coverage of the League Championship Series (ABC in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years), World Series (ABC televised the World Series in odd numbered years and NBC in even numbered years), and All-Star Game (ABC televised the All-Star Game in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years) through the 1989 season, with each of the 26 clubs receiving $7 million per year in return. The last package gave each club $1.9 million per year. ABC contributed $575 million for regular season prime time and Sunday afternoons and NBC paid $550 million for thirty Saturday afternoon games. ABC was contracted to televise 20 prime time regular season games a year in addition to other games (the aforementioned Sunday afternoon games).\nDuring the 1986 season, Don Drysdale did play-by-play ABC's Sunday afternoon games, which aired until July, when \"Monday Night Baseball\" began. Al Michaels did the main Sunday game usually with Jim Palmer, while Drysdale and Johnny Bench did the backup contests. No Sunday afternoon baseball games were telecast nationally in and .\nSunday afternoon games on CBS (1990-1991).\nCBS initially did not want to start their 1990 coverage until after the network had aired that year's NBA Finals (which was the last time CBS aired the Finals before the NBA's move to NBC). Therefore, only 12 regular season telecasts were scheduled. The broadcasts would have been each Saturday from June 16 through August 25 and a special Sunday telecast on the weekend of August 11–12 (the New York Yankees against the Oakland Athletics in Oakland on both days). Ultimately, four more telecasts were added – two in April and two on the last two Saturdays of the season.\nOn Sunday, May 5, 1991, CBS broadcast games involving Cleveland at Oakland (with Jack Buck and Tim McCarver on the call) and Boston at the Chicago White Sox (with Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat on the call). And then on Sunday, July 14 of that year, Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat called a game in Anaheim between the New York Yankees and California Angels.\nTBS's national package (2008–2021).\nBeginning with the 2008 season, TBS broadcast a weekly game nationally on Sunday afternoons, under the title \"Sunday MLB on TBS\". These games were not exclusive to TBS and were blacked out in local markets, to protect the stations that hold the local broadcast rights to the games. In the affected areas, simulcasts of programming from sister network HLN aired in place of the games, but recently, a message stating that the game was unavailable due to contractual requirements was aired until the game ended. Pre and postgame coverage remained available. Under the deal, TBS could show an alternate game in those markets, but the network elected not to do so.\nDespite initial reports that TBS would carry games on Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day, these holiday games were not part of the contract. For many years, games on these holidays were shown on ESPN, but that network discontinued them, with the occasional exception of when those holidays fell on ESPN's regular broadcast slots.\nTBS released a partial schedule of its inaugural slate of Sunday games on February 27, 2008. More games would be added as the season progressed, generally two weeks before each telecast date. TBS had the second pick of game after ESPN.\nConsequently, due to its non-exclusivity, highlights of a scheduled game that aired on \"MLB on TBS\" were not shown on the ESPN baseball highlight show \"Baseball Tonight\", nor are live simulcasts and highlights of the said game on the MLB.TV subscription service; instead local broadcasts of the scheduled game were shown. However, highlights of an \"MLB on TBS\" game did air on the \"MLB on Fox\" weekly program \"This Week in Baseball\" (until it was canceled in 2011), as well as \"MLB Tonight\" on the MLB Network.\nOn September 24, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia had renewed its rights through 2028 (aligned with the conclusion of Fox's most recent extension). A major change in the contract is the replacement of TBS's late-season Sunday games with a new, primetime game on Tuesday nights throughout the regular season.\n\"MLB Sunday Leadoff\" on Peacock/NBC (2022–present).\nIn March 2022, it was reported by \"The Wall Street Journal\" that NBC Sports was finalizing an agreement to establish a new package of Sunday afternoon games beginning in the 2022 MLB season. The 18-game package will air exclusively on the premium tier of Peacock, with the broadcasts produced by NBC Sports. It was reported that one game of the package each season would be simulcast on the NBC broadcast network, which will mark its first two national MLB broadcasts since 2000. NBC formally announced the deal on April 6, and that the inaugural broadcast would be a game between the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park on May 8. NBC will brand these games as \"MLB Sunday Leadoff\"."

        "text": "The Arizona State Sun Devils women's ice hockey team represents Arizona State University (ASU) in American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) women's Division I competition as a member of the Western Women's Collegiate Hockey League (WWCHL). It plays its home games at Mullett Arena in Tempe, beginning in the 2022–23 season.\nLindsey Ellis has been the team's coach in each of the program's seven years of existence, having grown up in nearby Peoria and coming back to Arizona to start the program after a successful career at Miami University that included an ACHA National Championship in 2014.\nHistory.\n2016–17.\nArizona State University announced the addition of women's club ice hockey in August 2015, with play scheduled to begin the following season in August 2016. The team would play its home games at Oceanside Ice Arena, the same venue as the men's team and just miles from campus. Arizona native Lindsey Ellis would serve as the head coach. Ellis played four years of club hockey at Miami University and was an alternate captain for two seasons. In her junior season, 2013/14, Ellis and Miami won the national title, the same year ASU's DI men's ACHA team won the title, prompting the wheels to be put in motion for a women's team at ASU.\nThe team's inaugural leadership group was made up of captain KC McGinley and alternate captains Dannika Borges, Amber Galles and Taylor England.\nASU played its first season with a thin roster and a road-heavy schedule, with the first game in ASU's history taking place on Friday, October 7 in Boulder, a 5–1 loss to the University of Colorado. The first goal in program history was scored by Erin Rawls 14:08 into the first period on an assist from Dannika Borges.\nOver the remainder of the regular season, the Sun Devils faced Colorado State University, Midland University, Lindenwood-Belleville, the University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin. While all of these games resulted in losses, the Midland games were close, both at scores of 3–1. After a 0–12 start, ASU's first wins as a program finally took place February 4, a 5–3 victory over the University of Denver that included its first ever hat trick, a three-goal effort from junior Amber Galles.\nAfter ending the season with a 2–1 win over Denver, ASU prepped for the WWCHL tournament, having earned a bid by being the host team. All three games of the postseason tournament were losses, 4–0 to Lindenwood, 5–4 to Colorado State and 5–4 to Midland. The team finished 2–15 and placed seventh in their eight-team conference.\n2017–18.\nAfter a challenging inaugural season that saw the Sun Devils go 2–15, the 2017/18 campaign was a season marked with significant improvement. While the roster was not any larger, with 10–12 skaters in any given game, the returners contributed more points than the previous season with key contributions from newcomers as well.\nGoaltender Jordan Nash-Boulden was the lone net-minder for ASU all year long, playing 1,499 minutes and facing 1,000 shots for a save percentage of .921. The team brought in a freshman class of three players, highlighted by Catherine Jones, who scored seven goals with seven assists for 14 points, good for 4th on the team.\nThe season began with two games against Grand Canyon University, marking the first meetings between the two teams in GCU's inaugural campaign. While the season's opener resulted in a tie, the Sun Devils stormed back the next night to take a 4–1 victory. Finishing off a stretch of six straight home games to open the season, the Devils dropped two games to Colorado, then two over Colorado State, ASU's first two wins over the CSU Rams in history.\nAfter the wins over CSU, the team hit a rough patch, dropping six straight games between the WWCHL Showcase in Colorado and two home losses and Midland. One of these loses was a 1–0 shutout at the hands of GCU, marking the Lopes' first win not only over ASU but as a program. Arizona State rebounded against GCU in December, ending 2017 on a strong note, beating GCU twice on the road with a 3–0 victory December 8 that was both Nash-Boulden's and the program's first shutouts.\nASU wrapped up its home-heavy regular season with two victories over Denver, clinching a berth to the WWCHL playoffs to be held at the end of February in Fremont, Nebraska. Before the postseason began, the Sun Devils hit the road for a non-conference weekend in Ohio, playing two games against head coach Lindsey Ellis' alma mater, Miami University and one against Ohio State.\nAhead of the postseason, Arizona State was ranked for the first time in program history, coming in at No. 15 in the ACHA weekly rankings for women's division 1. The season ended in Nebraska at Sidner Ice Arena, where the Sun Devils lost to Lindenwood-Belleville and Midland in the WWCHL tournament. The Sun Devils finished the season 8–15–1, the program's best mark and a conference record of 7–10–1 that positioned them fifth of the nine teams in the WWCHL.\n2018–19.\nArizona State's 2018/19 season was drastically different from seasons past, with the program's first large recruiting class and for the first time in team history, a full roster of 21 players. For the first four weeks of the season, the Sun Devils hovered between 12 and 14 in the ACHA rankings before dropping out for several weeks and reappearing at No. 15 later in the season.\nFor the second straight year, ASU began the season against Grand Canyon, continuing a cross-town rivalry that developed the previous season with a series split. With two games under her team's belt, head coach Lindsey Ellis chose to name four alternate captains, having waited until after the season began. Of the four, two were unique selections in the college hockey landscape, in a goaltender (Jordan Nash-Boulden) and a freshman (Kat Jones).\nThe Sun Devils then spent two weekends away from home, participating in the WWCHL showcase against Denver and Midland, in Colorado and a showcase in Springfield, Missouri, with games against Concordia Ann Arbor, Aquinas and McKendree. For the first time in program history, ASU tied Midland, drawing 4–4 in overtime for its first non-loss against the Warriors. In Missouri, the Devils went 2–1, with their only loss coming to McKendree, a 5–0 deficit on Saturday, October 27. In the October 25th game against CUAA, freshman forward Kat Jones recorded the second hat trick in program history, scoring three goals in the 8–1 win. The next six games were a stretch against the three Colorado teams. ASU split a home series with Colorado State, lost two to Colorado and beat Denver twice before coming back home to split a home-and-home series with GCU.\nWhen the calendar flipped to 2019, the Sun Devils wrapped up December with two losses to Minnesota, before taking a week off and bouncing back strong to wrap up the regular season with a sweep of GCU at home. On February 8, Kat Jones won the game with a shorthanded goal in overtime, the lone tally in a 1–0 victory.\nTo wrap up the season, ASU hosted the WWCHL conference tournament in Las Vegas at the Las Vegas Golden Knights' City National Arena. After a 3–1 loss to Colorado on February 22, the closest margin ever between the two teams, the Devils responded on February 23 with their first ever playoff win, a 4–0 victory over GCU to send the team into the semifinals for the first time in program history. While the season ended with a 3–0 loss to Midland late in the evening on the 23rd, the game not only marked the deepest playoff run in program history, but their 10-12-1 finish (.457 winning percentage) was the best in the young team's three seasons. 8-11-1 in conference play during the regular season was good for 3rd of the six teams in the WWCHL.\n2019–20.\nFor the first six games of the season, Arizona State played without captains, but in mid-October, head coach Lindsey Ellis named sophomore Kat Jones the team's captain, while naming seniors Molly Potter and Jordan Nash-Boulden, as well as sophomore Danielle Dupont, the alternate captains. For the first time in program history, Arizona State spent the entire season in the rankings, moving between 12th and 13th in the ACHA all season. \nThe Sun Devils opened up the 2019/20 season with 12 consecutive games on the road, including seven-game win streak to start the season with sweeps over Colorado State, Denver and cross-town rival Grand Canyon, as well as a win over Aquinas. After compiling a 2–1 record at a showcase in Springfield, Missouri, including a 13–0 win over Concordia Ann Arbor (the largest margin of victory in program history at the time) the team traveled to Michigan for the first time in program history with an 8-1 record to face Davenport, No. 3 Adrian and Michigan, winning over Davenport and Michigan. \nAfter an extended stretch on the road to begin the regular season, the team returned back home for the next six games, sweeping both league-newcomers Utah and cross-town rival Grand Canyon. The final two home games took place against No. 11 Colorado and for the first time in program history, the Sun Devils took the Buffaloes into overtime on February 7, only to fall 2-1. They returned to AZ Ice Arcadia on February 15 for a 3–2 win over GCU, securing a perfect 5-0 record against their cross-town rivals in the season, the first time they swept the Lopes across the season in program history. \nWith a 13–4 record under their belts, the Sun Devils traveled up to Salt Lake City, Utah, for the 2020 WWCHL Playoffs and made quick work of CSU and host Utah with 4-1 and 3-1 wins, to advance to the conference championship game for the first time in program history, where they looked to topple the Colorado Buffaloes, also for the first time in program history. CU scored just over two minutes into the first period and ASU responded with a late first period goal from captain Kat Jones and held a tie through the second period and into the third. Colorado added four goals over the game's final 14 minutes and used a 5-1 score to win the title game and advance to the ACHA National tournament. \nWhile falling one win short of a berth to nationals, the Sun Devils still set many program records, including the most wins in a single season (17), the best winning percentage (.773), most goals scored (95) and fewest goals scored against (37).\n2020–21.\nPer university regulations, the 2020/21 season was canceled and the team did not play any ACHA games. They returned to competition in Fall 2021.\n2021–22.\nThe 2021/22 season is currently ongoing.\nACHA Ranking History.\nThe top eight teams in the final ACHA ranking of the season receive an invitation to the ACHA National Tournament. In the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons, the ACHA tabulated rankings each week during the season and issued them on Tuesdays following weekends including games. Beginning in 2018–19, the ACHA switched to an entirely computerized system with again weekly rankings being released, albeit not always on Tuesdays.\nGoaltenders.\nGoaltender Career Stats.\n\"Seven goalies have played for ASU Women's Hockey through the 2023/24 season.\"\nHistorical Notes.\nHat Tricks.\n\"Arizona State women’s hockey has seen 18 hat tricks recorded in program history, plus three 4-goal games and one 5-goal game.

        "title": "1932 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1932 season was the 24th season of the Auckland Rugby League.\nDevonport United won the Senior grade with a 7 win, 2 draw, and 1 loss record ahead of Marist Old Boys and Ponsonby United. They were the dominant team and their only loss came in the final round when they had already secured their second title first having won it in 1928. Marist Old Boys stuffed their trophy cabinet when they won the Roope Rooster (defeating City Rovers 28–8), Stormont Shield (defeating Devonport United 15–8), and Max Jaffe Cup for finishing runner up in the Senior Championship (they beat Ponsonby United in a playoff after both teams tied for second by 37 to 8). City Rovers won the Thistle Cup after beating Devonport in the final by 22 to 19 after both teams finished with 8 competitions points in the second round thus forcing a playoff for the Cup. Richmond won the Davis Shield after their lower grade teams combined for the most competition points in Auckland. This was remarkably their 10th win in the Shields 12-year history.\nIn the reserve grade Richmond Reserves won with an 8 win, 2 loss record, with Ponsonby Reserves finishing runner up. The Marist Old Boys club added yet another trophy to their season haul with their reserve grade team winning the Stallard Cup (awarded to the reserve grade knockout winners) when they beat Devonport Reserves by 12–6 in the final.\nThe representative program was marked by a match between Auckland and the touring England team. In a very competitive match Auckland went down by 14 to 19. Aside from this fixture Auckland only played matches against South Auckland where they won 29 to 13, and Lower Waikato in Huntly where they won 35–8. There were a series of trial matches such as North Island v South Island and Probables v Possibles matches dominated by Auckland players.\n \n \nSeason News.\nAnnual general meeting.\nAt the annual general meeting of the Auckland Rugby League on 11 April, Mr. E.J. Phelan presided as acting president due to Mr. James Carlaw's absence. The plan put in place at the beginning of the 1931 season of having each club electing two members to represent them on the management committee and clubs taking a percentage of the gate receipts was considered a success. The election of officers took place and the results were: Patron: Hon. J.B. Donald (re-elected), President: Mr. James Carlaw (re-elected), Vice-presidents: Mr. George McMillan, Mr. O. Blackwood, Mr. S.H. Grange, Mr. W. Wallace, Mr. Gordon Seagar, Mr. Richard (Dick) Benson, Mr. C.H. Drysdale, Mr. E.J. Phelan, Mr. A.E. Laird, Mr. John A. Lee, Mr. R.H. Woods, Mr. R.T. Sharman (all re-elected), and Mr. W.J. Meilklejohn, Mr. G. Gray Campbell, Mr. J.W. Dixon, and Mr. C. Faulkner.\nManukau Rugby League Club reborn, club name changes and competition restructuring.\nPrior to the season commencing the Mount Wellington club requested permission to change its name to Otahuhu Rovers and this was approved by the league. Their chairman Mr. L.W. Arnold said that the reorganised club was in good hands and they would enter teams in the second, fourth, and school teams grades. Their colours would be royal blue.\nIt was decided that the Ellerslie-Otahuhu club would revert to the name of Ellerslie United, and that senior players would be able to transfer to any other club, but juniors would need to obtain transfer clearance from Ellerslie.\nAt a meeting the following night the league decided to cut the teams in the first grade from seven to six with Ellerslie (or rather the combined Ellerslie-Otahuhu United team of 1931) being culled from the grade. The teams which would remain were Marist Old Boys, Devonport United, Ponsonby United, City Rovers, Newton Rangers, Richmond Rovers. \"The New Zealand Herald\" previewed the 6 teams in the week leading up to the first round of matches. It was initially decided to play two senior matches at Carlaw Park with the reserve teams playing the curtain raisers. However, for Round 2 it was decided to play all three senior matches at Carlaw Park and reserve grade games elsewhere. This was a decision which clubs fought over as they wanted their reserve teams playing prior to the Senior A teams in case of needing players. This came to a fore after Round 5 when City Rovers arrived at Devonport, New Zealand 4 players short. Fortunately for them the reserve grade match was being played at the same venue at 1:30pm and so they were able to use those players to avoid defaulting.\nIn mid September plans began to manifest for the formation of a Manukau Rugby League Club. The plans were reported to an Auckland Rugby League Management Committee meeting. It was stated that there was a good deal of playing talent in the Manukau district. Mr. J. Rukutai was deputed to investigate the matter. On Thursday, 29 September they placed an ad for intending players and supporters to be held at the Strand Theatre Buildings, Onehunga. At this meeting the club was officially formed with Mr. H. Kemp convening the meeting. There were 52 people present including W. Mincham, referee of the RL Association, and Mr. T. Davis, secretary of the junior control board. Mr. J Rukutai said that the proposed club had been discussed by the league and they would give it every consideration. A resolution to form the club and have its headquarters in Onehunga was adopted. Mr W. Hayward was elected chairman, with the patron being Mr. W. J. Jordan, M.P., and the president Mr. E. Martin, Mayor of Onehunga. Financial assistance has also been promised by several local businessmen. A committee was formed to further the development of the club during the off season. The newly formed club asked that an exhibition match be played in Onehunga so that the club could gain some funds. Permission was granted for the match between second grade knockout final between Mangere and Mount Albert to be played at the Onehunga Recreation Reserve. The match was won by Mangere by 18 points to 15.\nFinancial statement, player passes and ground fees.\nThe financial statement said that the revenue from the 1931 season totalled £2,907 with £2,293 coming from gate receipts and £228 from ground rents. Spending had amounted to £2,066 meaning a net surplus of £813. Of this £472 was given to Auckland clubs, £68 to the Referees’ Association and the Junior Management Committee, £30 in grants to visiting teams, £195 in honorariums, and £66 in presentations and trophies. Carlaw Park was valued as an asset at £10,152. At a meeting of the Auckland Rugby League Board of Control on 17 March it was decided to continue with giving teams a percentage of the gate takings as had been started in 1931.\nThe League made a decision on an issue that had caused problems for several years, which was the abuse of players passes to gain entry to Carlaw Park on match days. Club secretaries would now have to supply the names of senior team players and that they would be checked in a side gate by a special official.\nIt was decided to admit military patients from Auckland Hospital into Carlaw Park to watch Senior matches free of charge news. The Patients’ Welfare Committee gratefully acknowledged the league for the move.\nThe Auckland Rugby League, Auckland Rugby Union, and Auckland Football Association had asked the city council if they could reduce their ground fees owing to the number of unemployed players. The city council decided to reduce charges despite their Parks Committee suggesting otherwise. Mr. E.J. Phelan moved to reduce fees from 5s to 3s for games played from 12:30pm to 1:45pm, from 10s to 7s/6d for games played from 1:45pm to 3pm, and from 15s to 12s/6d for games played from 3pm onwards. This motion was passed by a show of hands.\nRadio broadcast of Carlaw Park games.\nFor the first ever time commentary of a game at Carlaw Park was broadcast. The 1ZQ station broadcast coverage of the Ponsonby v Devonport game in Round 1. A temporary stand was also built to accommodate extra spectators for the England tour matches.\nRule issues.\nAt the Auckland Rugby League Referees’ Association meeting on 16 May the City Club inquired about the play the ball rule. It was said that the rule was not being enforced properly regarding the forwards needing to be inside a 5-yard radius behind their halfback when the ball was being played. The New Zealand Council also wished for it to be known that the attacking side had the loose head at scrums but the defending team were to put the ball in. In addition hookers were not to go on their knees in scrums in order to get an advantage when raking the ball back.\nBert Cooke switches codes.\nIn the middle of the season the famous All Black Bert Cooke (rugby) switched codes when he moved back to Auckland. He signed with the Richmond Rovers. The move proved very successful, so much so that he was selected for the North Island team in a trial match against the South Island only weeks after switching codes. He scored three tries and was selected for the New Zealand team to play England.\nObituaries.\nD.W. McLean.\nOn 1 March Mr. D. W. McLean suffered a heart attack and died at a meeting of the North Shore Rowing Club where he was president. He was the first New Zealand president of rugby league in Auckland. He, along with Mr. William Wynyard and others was one of the founders of rugby league in New Zealand.\nWilliam Wynyard.\nIn August William Thomas Wynyard, aged 49 died. He was from a sporting family with three uncles who were part of the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team that went on a rugby union tour of Great Britain. William played rugby union for North Shore and was an Auckland trialist before switching codes. He was a member of the New Zealand team which toured England in 1907–08 playing in 15 matches and scoring 4 tries. He was then part of the inaugural Auckland rugby league competition in 1909 playing intermittently for North Shore Albions from 1909 to 1913, and representing Auckland in 5 matches from 1908 to 1910. He retired in 1913 but remained involved in the game for many years after.\nHarry Johns.\nOn the morning of 4 October the Richmond senior player Harry Johns died aged 21 after a boxing match at the Auckland Town Hall the previous evening. He was knocked out in the 14th round of a 15-round fight by Archie Hughes of New South Wales. Johns had played junior football for Richmond since the age of 13 where he was a halfback. He had been in the seventh grade team which had won the championship and he repeated this feat in the following two years. In 1931 he was in the Third Intermediate grade which won the grade and he was promoted to the reserve grade team in 1932. His form was so good that he was promoted to the senior side and made the Probables versus Possibles match which played at Carlaw Park on 23 July. He was regarded as a certainty to gain higher honours in the future. Johns was originally from the West Coast of the South Island and was the oldest in a family of four. Several articles were published in \"The New Zealand Herald\" and the \"Auckland Star\" newspapers on his life and death. It was later reported that he had sustained a concussion in the Probables v Possibles match and bled from the nose along with requiring stitches in his head. He fought in Hastings shortly afterwards and lost. Johns then complained of feeling unwell and produced a medical certificate that he was not fit to fight. However he carried on playing league in the interim until beginning training for the fatal bout. It was said that those who knew him well could tell that he was not his usual self in the fight. He was laid to rest on 5 October at Waikumete Cemetery following an enormous gathering at the service with boxers and footballers walking before the cortege. Over 70 motor cars tailed the hearse and the entire procession was a mile long. The casket was draped in Richmond colours of blue and maroon.\nFox Memorial Shield (senior grade championship).\nFox Memorial fixtures.\nRound 2.\nAll Round 2 Senior matches were originally postponed due to heavy rain on the Saturday morning of 7 May. Horace Hunt, the former Auckland cricket representative wicket keeper scored for Devonport in their 14-9 win over Richmond. Frank Delgrosso's penalty proved the difference in Ponsonby's win over Newton. Delgrosso was in his 14th season for the Ponsonby seniors.\nRound 3.\nFollowing the match between Marist and Ponsonby there was a protest by the Ponsonby club asking for a replay. Near the end of the game with Ponsonby leading an offside player (Alan Clarke) from a kick recovered the ball without Frank Delgrosso, the Ponsonby fullback touching the ball. The player then ran in a try untouched and Marist went on to add to their score. The incident saw the referee jeered by the spectators for some time. The Auckland Rugby League were not interested in a replay as it was a matter of a possible refereeing error rather than an incorrect rule interpretation.\nRound 4.\nNewton's win over Richmond was a milestone in the club's history with it being their 100th first grade win. To this point they had played in 23 seasons. By the season end their all-time first grade record stood at 100-11-133 (For: 2,796 Against: 3,307).\nRound 7.\nIn the Ponsonby match with Newton, C Stevens was ordered off for Ponsonby after questioning the referee's decisions. He had been warned for doing this 3 times already.\nRound 9.\n Round 9 was marked by the debut of Bert Cooke for the Richmond Rovers. He was a famous All Black rugby player and his switching of codes caused great interest. He kicked a penalty in a 13-6 win over Newton at Carlaw Park. It was decided to play the reserve and senior matches between Ponsonby and City at the Northcote municipal ground at Stafford Park to help raise funds for the Northcote relief fund as the depression was in full swing by this time. A sum of nearly £7 was raised for the Northcote Relief Committee as a result of the collection taken up at the match.\nRound 10.\nThe Round 10 matches were originally postponed on 9 July due to heavy rain in the lead up. This created scheduling issues with the need to select an Auckland team and New Zealand team to play against the touring England side in addition to finding opponents to play the victorious Northern Union Cup winners. Ultimately the final round was not able to be played until 13 August. Marist's match with Newton saw the debut for them of Jim Laird who had transferred from Ngaruawahia and the following weekend saw him debut for New Zealand in the third test.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nIn the Round 1 match between Ponsonby and Newton three players were ordered off in the second half, two from Ponsonby (Heck Lunn and C Stevens) one from Newton (Ed St George). It was the second time C Stevens had been ordered off this season.\nSemi finals.\nWilliam (Bill) Cornthwaite, the Auckland rugby representative switched codes and joined the Marist club, debuting for them in their semi-final match where he scored a try and kicked a goal in a 19–18 win over Devonport.\nFinal.\nBill (Rauaroa Tangaroapeau) Turei debuted for City after switching codes from the Manukau rugby club. He had played for New Zealand Māori against New South Wales in 1928 and was originally from Gisborne. He was a very good tennis player, making the Auckland championship finals in 1932. Turei would later enlist in the World War II effort and died while in Italy in 1944.\nStormont Shield.\nAlbert Laing injured his leg in the first half when he collided with Bert Schultz and had to leave the field. Devonport United led the Stormont Shield match until about 5 minutes from time when Marist Old Boys scored the go ahead try in the corner. A large number of spectators had encroached on the field and Devonport argued that the match should be replayed but this was refused. Arguments were put forward about what could be done to keep spectators from the field as it was a recurring problem at Carlaw Park, especially with matches on the #2 field where fans would often walk across it after the #1 field match was completed despite the match on #2 still being in progress.\nThistle Cup final.\nThis was the first occasion that the Thistle Cup had been decided by a final. It was a trophy awarded to the team which accrued the most competition points in the second round of the championship. Both City and Devonport finished with 8 competition points (City secured 3 wins and 2 draws to Devonports 4 wins and 1 loss). City had to defeat Devonport in Round 10 of the championship to force this match and they repeated the result in the final by winning 22–19.\nMax Jaffe Cup charity match.\nThe Max Jaffe Cup was awarded to the team which finished runner up in the championship. As Marist Old Boys and Ponsonby United were tied a playoff was required.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nTop try and point scorers for the Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster and Stormont Shield competitions (the competitions all A Division teams competed in). Frank Delgrosso of Ponsonby was the top point scorer for the 4th time in his career with 74 points. He was regularly in the top 5 point scorers in the first grade competitions and to this point in his career had amassed more than any other player, with 774 points for Ponsonby in all matches. The top try scorer was Claude List of Marist.\nSenior reserve grade competition.\nSenior reserve grade fixtures.\nRound 10 was postponed due to heavy rain prior to and on the day of the matches. The Round 10 match between Ponsonby Reserves and Richmond Reserves decided the title. Richmond won 8 to 3 in a match which later caused major controversy as several Ponsonby players played in the match and then belatedly made their way to Carlaw Park to play for the senior side. This meant that the senior match was 20 minutes late kicking off and the players involved were suspended by their club. The coach, Mr. F. C. White later took responsibility for the decision. The reserve grade team met and made a lengthy statement about their situation and actions. They felt that they had been treated unjustly and were upset with the management of the Ponsonby club during the season. Ponsonby decided to disqualify the reserve grade coach, Mr. F. C. White from his position as coach and as club vice-president for his role in the saga. The situation dragged on for several weeks with Auckland Rugby League seeking explanations from the Ponsonby club as the players in particular pleaded their case and the sanctions were largely applied by the club rather than the league.\nAs reporting of the reserve grade was usually limited to just the results there were weeks where results were missing altogether. The Round 5 results were not reported, and the Round 9 match between Newton and Richmond was not reported though Richmond were the winners. They were also the winners of the Round 5 match over Devonport which was crucial in enabling them to win the championship.\nOther club matches and lower grades.\nLower grade clubs.\nThe Davis Shield awarded to the club with the most competition points in lower grades was again awarded to Richmond. Since it had been awarded for the first time in 1921 they had won it every single year except for 1924 when City Rovers won it and 1931 when Marist Old Boys won it.\nPapakura won the Wright Shield for taking out the Second Grade, Ponsonby won the Third Grade Open and were awarded the Hayward Shield, Northcote's Third Intermediate team won the Walker Cup, Point Chevalier won the Fourth Grade Hospital Cup, City Rovers won the Fifth Grade Endean Shield, Richmond won the Sixth Grade Banner and the Seventh Grade Myers Cup. The Myers Cup was the trophy originally awarded to the winners of the Senior Championship in its formative years. The Davis Shield for junior points went to Richmond with Marist in second place. This was the third year in a row that these two clubs finished in the top two positions.\nSecond grade.\nThe championship was won by Papakura who defeated Otahuhu in an extra match to decide the title by 5 points to 2 on September 24. Northcote and Papakura had been tied with two rounds to go and Papakura won 5-2 to move up equal with Ōtāhuhu. This forced a playoff for the championship which Papakura won. Māngere beat Mount Albert 18–15 in the knockout final on October 15. This match was played at Onehunga and used to raise funds for the newly reformed Manukau club. Māngere had defeated Ōtāhuhu 11-2 in one semi-final while Mount Albert beat Papakura 19-8 in the other.\nThird Grade Open standings.\nPonsonby won the championship, finishing two points clear of Richmond. Richmond won the knockout competition when they beat Ponsonby in the final 19 points to 18 on October 15. After the first round of the knockout competition there were three teams remaining (Ponsonby, Richmond, and Marist). Ponsonby beat Marist to qualify for the final, while Richmond beat the same Marist side a week later to make the final which they won.\nThird Intermediate Grade standings.\nNorthcote won the championship, 2 points ahead of City. The knockout final was won by Marist who beat Richmond on October 1 by 15 points to 12.\nFourth Grade standings.\nThe championship was won by Point Chevalier with Akarana runners-up, one point back. The knockout cup was won by Akarana who defeated Papakura in the final on September 24. Papakura had defeated Ōtāhuhu in one semi final, while Akarana beat Point Chevalier in the other.\nFifth Grade standings.\nCity won the championship. The knockout final was won by Newton 3–0 over Northcote. One of the Brimble brothers who later represented New Zealand captained the Newton side. Northcote B withdrew after 6 rounds. On July 30 City beat Marist A 3-0 in a curtain-raiser to the New Zealand v England test match, while a week later Ellerslie beat City 5-2 in a curtain raiser to the Auckland-England game.\nSixth Grade standings.\nThe championship was won by Richmond A who finished 6 competition points ahead of City. Richmond A also won the knockout cup when they beat Richmond B 21 points to 5 on September 17. Richmond A had defeated Point Chevalier in one semi final by 8 points to 0, while Richmond B beat City 6-5 in the other.\nSeventh Grade standings.\nIn a remarkable season, the Richmond A team won the championship by 10 competition points over Devonport. They won all 12 matches and scored 333 points, conceding 0. They also won the knockout competition, defeating Māngere 27-0 in a semi final, and then Ellerslie 38-0 in the final.\nPrimary schools standings.\nEllerslie won the championship. A 'knockout' competition was played however it involved a full round robin with Ellerslie winning the final by 3 points to 0 over Newton on October 8. There were also full season competition point totals reported for Ellerslie (29), Newton (27), and Devonport (19) so it appears that the knockout competition was more appropriately named a second round competition.

Bert Cooke made his North Island debut and played brilliantly, scoring three tries for the winners in front of a crowd of 15,000. He had only recently converted to rugby league but his performance was instrumental in his selection for the New Zealand test team. Len Scott also scored three tries with Claude List crossing for one. Albert Laing converted three of the North Island's seven tries. Laing also made his debut for New Zealand after his effort, while Scott and List also gained New Zealand selection once more after having debuted for New Zealand in 1928. For the South Island Devonport and Hamberger scored a try each. Jim Amos had kicked two goals before being replaced. Jonas Masters kicked their other three goals.\nAuckland v England.\n With the attraction of the England team which had recently toured Australia the league authorities added several hundred seats by building a temporary stand at the northern end of the field at Carlaw Park. The reported attendance for the match was 15,000.\nLower Waikato v Auckland (inter-provincial Sunshine Cup charity match).\nSeveral of the originally named players for Lower Waikato were unable to play so a weakened lineup was fielded.\nEngland Tour (Carlaw Park tests).\nFollowing their tour of Australia where they had a tour record of 15 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses, including a 2–1 test series victory the English team toured New Zealand. They arrived on the Niagara ship into Auckland on 25 July and were met on the boat by Mr C.A. Sneddon, the president of the New Zealand Rugby League Council, Mr. W.O. Carlaw, secretary, and Mr. R.W. Pollock, a member of the council. They were then given a civic welcome at the Town Hall by the Mayor, Mr. G. W. Hutchison. The team stayed at the Hotel Auckland before travelling to Whangarei for their first tour match. Their programme included 8 tour matches against Northland (Won 56–5), South Auckland (Won 65–11), Auckland (Won 19–14), West Coast (Won 32–8) and North Island XIII (Won 59–8), along with three tests (Won 24–9, 25–14, and 20–18). This meant that they finished their tour with the fine record of 23–1–2. The First and Third tests were played at Carlaw Park as was the match against Auckland. The team trained at Victoria Park, Auckland on the day after their arrival in preparation for their first match of the tour."

The pool stage begins on the weekend of 15–17 November 2019, and will end, following 6 rounds of games, on the weekend of 18–19 February 2020.\nSeeding.\nThe twenty competing teams are seeded and split into four tiers, each containing five teams.\nFor the purpose of creating the tiers, clubs are ranked based on their domestic league performances and on their qualification for the knockout phases of their championships, so a losing quarter-finalist in the Top 14 would be seeded below a losing semi-finalist, even if they finished above them in the regular season.\nBased on these seedings, teams are placed into one of the four tiers, with the top-seeded clubs being put in Tier 1. The nature of the tier system means that a draw is needed to allocate two of the three second-seed clubs to Tier 1. The fourth-seed team from the same domestic league as the second-seed team which was put in Tier 2 will also be placed in Tier 2.

Four points are awarded for a win, two points for a draw, one attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and one defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers are used, as directed by EPCR:\n(Q) denotes the team has qualified for the quarter-finals as the pool winners\n(q) denotes team has at least qualified for the quarter-finals as one of the three highest-scoring second-place teams"

It was the season-ending event for the highest-ranked singles players and doubles teams on the 2020 ATP Tour. This was the final year that London hosted the event. On 14 August 2020, it was announced the tournament would be held without spectators in attendance following guidelines imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.\nThe tournament took place from 15 to 22 November at the O2 Arena in London, United Kingdom. It was the 51st edition of the tournament (46th in doubles). The tournament was run by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and was part of the 2020 ATP Tour. The event took place on indoor hard courts. It served as the season-ending championships for players on the ATP Tour.\nIn singles (and in doubles with teams in place of individual players), the eight players who qualified for the event were split into two groups of four. During this stage, players competed in a round-robin format. The two players in each group with the best results, including head-to-head records, progressed to the semifinals, where the winners of a group faced the runners-up of the other group. This stage, however, was a knock-out stage.\nFinals.\nSingles.\n Daniil Medvedev defeated Dominic Thiem, 4–6, 7–6(7–2), 6–4.\nDoubles.\n Wesley Koolhof / Nikola Mektić defeated Jürgen Melzer / Édouard Roger-Vasselin 6–2, 3–6, [10–5].\nFormat.\nThe ATP Finals had a round-robin format, with eight players/teams divided into two groups of four. The eight seeds were determined by the ATP rankings and ATP Doubles Team Rankings on the Monday after the last ATP Tour tournament of the calendar year. All singles matches, including the final, were best of three sets with tie-breaks in each set including the third. All doubles matches were two sets (no ad) and a Match Tie-break.\nPoints and prize money.\nThe ATP Finals currently (2020) rewards the following points and prize money, per victory:\nQualification.\nSingles.\nEight players compete at the tournament, with two named alternates. Players receive places in the following order of precedence:\nIn the event of this totaling more than 8 players, those lower down in the selection order become the alternates. If further alternates are needed, these players are selected by the ATP.\nProvisional rankings are published weekly as the \"ATP Race to London\", coinciding with the 52-week rolling ATP rankings on the date of selection. Points are accumulated in Grand Slam, ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour tournaments from the 52 weeks prior to the selection date, with points from the previous years Tour Finals excluded. Players accrue points across 18 tournaments, usually made up of:\nAll players must include the ranking points for mandatory Masters tournaments for which they are on the original acceptance list and for all Grand Slams for which they would be eligible, even if they do not compete (in which case they receive zero points). Furthermore, players who finished 2017 in the world's top 30 are \"commitment players\" who must (if not injured) include points for the 8 mandatory Masters tournament regardless of whether they enter, and who must compete in at least 4 ATP 500 tournaments (though the Monte Carlo Masters may count to this total), of which one must take place after the US Open. Zero point scores may also be taken from withdrawals by non-injured players from ATP 500 tournaments according to certain other conditions outlined by the ATP. Beyond these rules, however, a player may substitute his next best tournament result for missed Masters and Grand Slam tournaments.\nPlayers may have their ATP Tour Masters 1000 commitment reduced by one tournament, by reaching each of the following milestones:\nIf a player satisfies all three of these conditions, their mandatory ATP Tour Masters 1000 commitment is dropped entirely. Players must be in good standing as defined by the ATP as to avail of the reduced commitment.\nThe ATP Cup will count as an additional event in a player's rankings breakdown.\nDoubles.\nEight teams compete at the tournament, with one named alternates. The eight competing teams receive places according to the same order of precedence as in Singles. The named alternate will be offered first to any unaccepted teams in the selection order, then to the highest ranked unaccepted team, and then to a team selected by the ATP. Points are accumulated in the same competitions as for the Singles tournament. However, for Doubles teams there are no commitment tournaments, so teams are ranked according to their 18 highest points scoring results from any tournaments.\nPoints breakdown.\nSingles.\nOn 16 March 2020, the ATP rankings were frozen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of this pandemic, the ATP changed its ranking system for 2020 as the promotion for the 2020 ATP Race is no longer valid.

There is no obvious clue in the plaques, which have remained uniform in style and execution over 30 years.\nIn 2023 the pedestals were relocated to a more formal arrangement with the Bradman statue as a focal point."

        "title": "2019 World Athletics Championships – Men's marathon",
        "text": "The men's marathon was one of the road events at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar. Due to the heat in Doha, the race was scheduled to begin at 23:59 on 5 October 2019. Even with the unusual timing, high temperatures were expected to provide difficult conditions for running, but in the end temperatures dropped to around and 50% humidity. The race was won by Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia in , followed four seconds behind by his compatriot Mosinet Geremew. Amos Kipruto of Kenya was third in 2:10:51.\nThe marathon was held on Doha Corniche, and consisted of six laps of a roughly floodlit course. Derlis Ayala of Paraguay broke away from the start, and led the race until he was caught by a pack consisting of Desisa, Geremew, Geoffrey Kirui, Kipruto, Stephen Mokoka and Zersenay Tadese just before the halfway mark. Mokoka and Tadese attempted to speed away from the pack a few times, but were caught on each occasion. After , the pack began to splinter, and after Kirui and Tadese had dropped back, Callum Hawkins joined the leading group at the point. Desisa gradually increased the pace from that stage, culminating in a sprint finish to win the race. All the top ten finishers qualified automatically for the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nQualification.\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF, now World Athletics) announced the qualifying criteria for the 2019 World Athletics Championships in December 2018. For the men's marathon, the entry standard was 2:16:00, three minutes quicker than had been required for the 2017 marathon. Alternatively, a top-10 finish at an IAAF Gold Label marathon, or a wild card entry as the reigning world champion would ensure qualification. Entry criteria had to be met during the qualification period: 7 March 2018 to 6 September 2019, inclusive.\nPreview.\nDue to the hot conditions in Doha, the World Championships were scheduled in October, rather than the traditional August, and instead of holding the marathon during the day, it started just before midnight local time to minimise the impact that the heat would have on the race, making it the first-ever World Championships to feature night marathons; first the women's on 27 September, and then the men's on 5 October. Despite these changes, the temperature was expected to be a key factor in the race: temperatures were predicted to be around , with humidity levels above 80 per cent. In mitigation, the IAAF added extra water stations and medical staff along the route, as well as more ice baths at the finish. The course consisted of six laps of a floodlit roughly course along the Doha Corniche, a waterfront promenade on Doha Bay. The loop started in front of the Amiri Diwan, and stretched to the Sheraton Hotel.\nEliud Kipchoge, the world record holder and Olympic champion for the marathon, did not take part in the World Championships as he was preparing for the . Sean Ingle of \"The Guardian\" said that \"most of the world's top marathon runners\" were not taking part. Steve Smythe of \"Athletics Weekly\" concurred and said that with so many good runners missing, it was hard to predict who might win. He suggested Mosinet Geremew and Mule Wasihun of Ethiopia as contenders, along with the reigning World Champion, Geoffrey Kirui, though he noted that Kirui was out of form. In his preview for World Athletics, Mike Rowbottom suggested that the winner was \"likely to be Kenyan, Ethiopian or Bahraini\", and he concurred that Geremew and Wasihun were the two \"clear favourites\".\nBoth the high temperatures, and the tactical nature of World Championship races, meant that it was not expected that any records would be set. Abel Kirui held the World Championship record of 2:06:54 achieved in 2009, while Eliud Kipchoge held the overall men's world record of 2:01:39, set during the 2018 Berlin Marathon.\nSummary.\nThe race was officially scheduled to start at 23:59 local time (UTC+3) on 5 October 2019; temperatures had cooled since the women's marathon, at and 48.6 per cent humidity. At the start of the race, Derlys Ayala of Paraguay broke away from the front of the field and established a 150 metre-lead over the other runners by the end of the first kilometre. Behind Ayala, who had run the Buenos Aires Marathon twelve days earlier and was not considered a genuine contender in the race, a pack consisting of Lelisa Desisa, Mosinet Geremew, Geoffrey Kirui, Amos Kipruto, Stephen Mokoka and Zersenay Tadese formed. David Monti of \"LetsRun.com\" described them as a \"pack of six serious contenders\". Ayala held a 62-second lead at the point of the race, but later, the margin had been reduced to six seconds. By halfway through the race, Ayala had been caught, and he withdrew from the race soon after. Over the next , Tadese led most of the race. He and Mokoka broke away from the rest a few times, but could not maintain the advantage, and were caught each time. After the race, Desisa said \"I controlled everybody and I saved my power.\"\nThe leading group of six completed the first of the race in 1:33:13, but started to break apart over the next . Kirui was the first to drop away, followed by Tadese. In contrast, Callum Hawkins, who had been in ninth place after 30km, closed the gap on the leaders to around 14 seconds by the point. Geremew said that he started to develop plantar pain about later and slowed the pace a little, which allowed Hawkins to catch the pack just prior to the point, when he briefly led the race. The pace increased as they approached the end of the race; the 41st kilometre was completed in 2:59. When there was one kilometre left, Desisa increased the pace again, which Hawkins could not match, and the Scottish runner fell back. After the race, he suggested that: \"Maybe I just gave too much in the middle stages. But I couldn't do any more.\" Kipruto was also unable to keep up with the fast finish, and when Desisa accelerated to a sprint for the final , he also broke clear of Geremew to claim the gold medal. He won the race in a time of 2:10:40, four seconds ahead of Geremew. Kipruto held onto third place in 2:10:51, six seconds in front of Hawkins.\nResults.\nThe final was started on 5 October at 23:59.

        "text": "The men's 3000 metres steeplechase at the 2019 World Athletics Championships was held at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha from 1 to 4 October 2019.\nSummary.\nKenya considers the steeplechase to be their national sport. With defending champion Conseslus Kipruto, they qualified four to the final. the USA, with two Kenyan ex-pats and Ethiopia, also qualified all three of their entrants. This was only the second major championship since 2007 without perennial medalist Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad. Kipruto almost didn't make it. A stress fracture in April would sideline him for months, but he builds a primitive swimming pool at his home in Mosoriot Kenya to do aqua training until he could run again.\nWhile they are a neighboring long-distance running rival, Ethiopia does not have the same successful track record in the steeplechase, but was encouraged by Getnet Wale winning the 2019 IAAF Diamond League. Here the Ethiopians took to the lead. Chala Beyo took the point first with Wale ,and Kipruto pushing the pace out front. After two laps, Wale took over. Beyo would not finish. Starting slower, Lamecha Girma ran in the middle of the pack for a while before moving forward to take over leading duties for the team. The fast pace dropped off many of the runners, the lead pack dwindling to the entire Kenyan team, Hillary Bor, Djilali Bedrani, returning silver medalist Soufiane El Bakkali, Wale and Girma. With two laps to go, Kipruto moved out to the lead and looked around for his teammates to join him, but help did not come forward. Instead, Wale moved ahead again and El Bakkali planted himself on Kipruto's shoulder. As the pace increased, the other three Kenyan's fell off the back of the pack. Bedrani and Bor were the next to go. It was a four-man group at the bell with Girma on the tail end. Through the penultimate turn, El Bakkali took the lead. For most of the last decade, the steeplechase was decided by a devastating move off the first barrier on the backstretch, usually by Ezekiel Kemboi. It is where Kipruto won the race in 2017 and the Olympics in 2016. Here, coming off the barrier, Kipruto gained a couple of feet on Wale but El Bakkali remained in command. Instead, Girma ran around the group and into the lead. Kipruto tried to react, passing El Bakkali over the water jump. Wale had no answer for the speed and the medalists were decided. Going into the final barrier, Girma opened up two metres on Kipruto. Coming off the barrier, Kipruto launched into a sprint gaining slightly on Girma. Desperately looking for the finish Girma dipped a little early, Kipruto dipped like a seasoned professional hurdler. In the photo finish, Kipruto took the gold by .01. 18-year-old Girma got the consolation prize of the Ethiopian national record that 19-year-old Wale had improved twice already in 2019.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 8:29.00.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three in each heat (Q) and the next six fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 4 October at 21:45."

Holloway was gaining a little on every hurdle, and by the fourth, Pascal Martinot-Lagarde was even with Ortega. As Holloway's lead extended, McLeod pressed. McLeod rattled the eighth hurdle. Ortega again was slightly ahead of Martinot-Lagarde, but Shubenkov was also there moving fast on the outside. McLeod hit the 9th with his foot flat, losing his balance while running at full speed. He popped up trying to get over the final barrier, bumping Ortega to his right as he failed, crashing to the track. Holloway won by a metre with Shubenkov beating Martinot-Lagarde to the line. After the bump, Ortega managed to stay upright, crossing the line in fifth, his arms outstretched as if asking what could be done after he was interfered with.\nHolloway continued celebrating all the way through the first turn and half way down the backstretch before dramatically flopping to the track on his back. McLeod was disqualified for interference.

While world record holder Kevin Young never officially retired, now at 53 he's largely been a spectator for a couple of decades. The other three have accomplished the feat in less than a year, two this season in the same race. And all three were in Doha setting up a highly anticipated confrontation.\nIt took 48.93 to make the final. Abdelmalik Lahoulou set the Algerian national record and Alison dos Santos a personal best to get there.\nIn the final, Rai Benjamin in lane 7 appeared to get a better start, making up the stagger on Lahoulou to his outside, but that may have been deceptive. Down the backstretch, defending champion Karsten Warholm started to take charge. All alone in lane 9, the third of the big 3 Abderrahman Samba, was getting passed by. Through the turn, Warholm held his advantage over Benjamin which revealed to be a full stride coming off the turn. Kyron McMaster looked to be in third place. Benjamin made a run at Warholm down the stretch but stretched for the final hurdle, landing awkwardly and losing momentum and his last opportunity to try to catch Warholm.

        "title": "2020 Super Rugby season",
        "text": "The 2020 Super Rugby season was the 25th season of Super Rugby, an international men's rugby union competition organised by SANZAAR involving teams from Argentina, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa. It is the third tournament in its current 15 team format, the last before the Japanese side the Sunwolves withdraw from the tournament ahead of a new format in 2021. The current champions are the Crusaders, who won their 10th title in 2019.\nOn 14 March 2020, it was announced that play would be suspended after the conclusion of the weekend's fixtures, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a travel restriction that was announced by New Zealand earlier in the day. Replacement regional tournaments would take place thereafter, beginning in June in New Zealand, July in Australia and October in South Africa.\nCompetition format.\nFifteen teams were to partake in the 2020 edition of Super Rugby. They were split into three conferences: the Australian Conference (consisting of four Australian teams and the Japanese ), the New Zealand Conference (consisting of five New Zealand teams), and the South African Conference (consisting of four South African teams and the from Argentina).\nThe group stages were to consist of 18 rounds of matches spanning from 31 January 2020 until the beginning of June. Teams were to play 16 matches each across these 18 rounds with two bye weeks built into each of their schedules. Teams were to play each of their conference rivals home and away and then another eight matches against non-conference teams either home or away, but against a minimum of four of the teams in the other conferences.\nThe winner of each conference would qualify for the Super Rugby finals, along with the next five best teams from all the conferences. The winners of each conference and the best placed team were to host the quarterfinals. It was planned that winners of the quarterfinals would progress to the semifinals, and the winners of the semifinals to the final, but eventually all matches were cancelled (see below).\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, two Sunwolves matches were moved to Australia from Japan. It was announced 12 March that although fans would still be admitted for that weekend's fixtures, future rounds held in Australia were to be played behind closed doors. On 14 March, New Zealand announced that all travellers entering the country from outside of the Pacific Islands would be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. As this would have made play logistically difficult, SANZAAR announced that the season would be suspended indefinitely following the completion of the seventh round of fixtures.\nFollowing the suspension, SANZAAR and regional rugby boards proposed regional tournaments to replace the Super Rugby fixtures that were cancelled. On 6 May, New Zealand Rugby announced that a Super Rugby Aotearoa competition, involving the five New Zealand teams, would begin on 13 June. The competition will be contested using a double round robin format, with 20 matches played over 10 weeks. On 27 May, Rugby Australia confirmed Super Rugby AU would begin on 3 July, involving the four Australian sides in the Australian conference and the Western Force, who played in Super Rugby until the 2017 season. The Sunwolves were also in discussions to take part in the Australian competition, but due to travel restrictions were unable to do so. Following this, the club was disbanded on 1 June, with the side having been due to leave Super Rugby at the end of the original 2020 season.\nOn 16 September, SA Rugby announced a 7 team competition between the four South African Super Rugby sides, plus the Cheetahs from Pro14, and the Griquas and Pumas from the Currie Cup, starting on 10 October. On 18 September, the official details of the Super Rugby Unlocked tournament was announced, with the 7 teams playing each other in a round robin format over the course of 7 weeks, with the domestic Currie Cup competition continuing thereafter.\nStandings.\nRound-by-round.\nThe table below shows each team's progression throughout the season. For each round, their cumulative points total is shown with the overall log position in brackets:\nMatches.\nThe fixtures for the 2020 Super Rugby competition were released on 10 September 2019.\nPlayers.\nSquads.\nThe following 2020 Super Rugby squads have been named:\n \nTop scorers.\nThe top ten try and point scorers during the 2020 Super Rugby season are:\nReferees.\nThe following refereeing panel was appointed by SANZAAR for the 2020 Super Rugby season:"

However, the last professional billiards and snooker championships organised by the WBA were those held in 1950, and by the early 1970s the organisation had \"fallen on hard times\" according to leading snooker journalist and author Clive Everton.\nA Women's Billiards &amp; Snooker Association (WBSA) was formed in 1976, and in 1978 appointed Wally West, snooker club owner, and holder of the world record break of 151, as Secretary. The Association organised the 1976 Women's World Open snooker championship and further championships in 1980 and 1981.\nWorld Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association (WLBSA), 1981–2015.\nMandy Fisher, a leading woman player, founded the World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association (WLBSA) in 1981. The WLBSA held its first open snooker competition in Leeds in March 1982, and within a couple of years, the WBSA lost control of snooker to the WLBSA.\nIn 1997, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) started providing support and prize money for WLBSA tournaments, but the WPBSA's support for the women's circuit stopped in 2002 following the loss of income due to the UK government's restrictions on tobacco sponsorship of sport.\nWorld Ladies Billiards and Snooker (WLBS), 2015–2018.\nThe WLBSA was restructured as a subsidiary of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association in 2015, and became a full member of the World Snooker Federation in 2017.

        "text": "The 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup will be the ninth edition of the T20 World Cup, a biennial Twenty20 International (T20I) tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It is scheduled to be co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States from the 1 to 29 June 2024. It will be the first ICC World Cup tournament to feature matches played in the United States, and in any other country other than the West Indies in the Americas. England are the defending champions, having defeated Pakistan in the final of the previous edition.\nThe tournament will be contested by a record 20 teams, an expansion from 16 teams at the 2022 tournament; they will include the two hosts, the top eight teams from the 2022 edition, the next two teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings, and eight teams determined by regional qualifiers. Canada and Uganda qualified for the men's T20 World Cup for the first time, while the United States is participating for the first time by virtue of being co-host.\nFormat.\nThe 20 qualifying teams will be divided into four groups of five teams; the top two teams in each group will advance to the Super 8 round. In this stage, the qualifying teams will be split into two groups of four; the top two teams from each group will qualify for the knockout stage, which will consist of two semi-finals and a final.\nHost selection.\nIn November 2021, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup would be played in the United States and the West Indies. A joint bid was submitted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket following two years of preparation, forming part of a strategic partnership between the two associations. The ICC's publicly stated hope is that hosting a major competition for the first time will put the USA on the global cricketing map. Several matches have been planned for the USA, including the blockbuster conflict between India and Pakistan, which will be held in New York.\nTeams and qualification.\nThe top eight teams from the 2022 tournament and the two hosts qualified automatically for the tournament. The remaining two automatic qualification places were taken by the best-ranked teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings which had not already secured a place in the finals, as of 14 November 2022.\nThe eight remaining places were filled via the ICC's regional qualifiers, consisting of two teams from Africa, Asia, and Europe, along with one team each from the Americas and the East Asia-Pacific groups. In May 2022, the ICC confirmed the sub-regional qualification pathways for Europe, East Asia-Pacific, and Africa.\nIn July 2023, Ireland and Scotland from the Europe Qualifier became the first two teams to qualify, followed by Papua New Guinea from the East Asia-Pacific Qualifier. Canada secured their qualification in October 2023 after defeating Bermuda in their final match in the Americas Qualifier. The following month, Nepal and Oman qualified after reaching the final of the Asia Qualifier in Nepal,followed by Namibia and Uganda becoming the final two teams to qualify after ensuring a top-two finish in the Africa Qualifier. Zimbabwe became the only Test-playing country that failed to qualify.\nSquads.\nOn 29 April 2024, New Zealand were the first team to announce their squad for the tournament. They were followed the next day by England, India and South Africa announcing their squads. On May 1, the deadline for announcing the squads, Australia, Afghanistan, Oman, and Nepal also revealed their teams.\nThe West Indies will announce their squad on 3 May 2024.\nVenues.\nIn May 2023, CWI began a thorough bidding process for countries in the Caribbean region and the United States willing to host the matches of the World Cup.\nIn July 2023, the ICC shortlisted four venues in the United States, Central Broward Park in Lauderhill, Florida, Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, and a temporary stadium at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, New York City. Residents of the Bronx objected to the Van Cortlandt Park stadium, citing that it would restrict public access to the park for an extended period of time, showed concerns for its environmental impact, and questioned the economic viability of the event. On 20 September 2023, the ICC announced that Grand Prairie, Lauderhill, and New York City would serve as the three U.S. host cities during the tournament, with a 34,000-seat temporary stadium proposed for Eisenhower Park on Long Island in Nassau County, New York. Central Broward Park and Grand Prairie Stadium will also be expanded with temporary grandstands and hospitality areas to double their capacity during the tournament. \nOn 22 September 2023, the ICC announced that venues in Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Guyana, St Lucia, St Vincent &amp; The Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago would serve as the hosts for the West Indies. Jamaica, St Kitts &amp; Nevis and Grenada did not submit bids to host the World Cup, with Jamaican sports minister Olivia Grange ruling out a bid on cost grounds.\nIn November 2023, it was reported that Trinidad's Queen's Park Oval, the country's most considerable cricket ground, would not be hosting any World Cup matches and that fixtures would be moved to the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in San Fernando. Nigel Camacho, the president of the Queen's Park Cricket Club, stated that the venue would instead most likely host warm-up matches before the start of the main tournament. Also, the Government of Dominica decided to withdraw its venue, Windsor Park, from hosting any matches of the World Cup citing their inability to complete the infrastructural development of the venue before the tournament commences.\nIn December 2023, a delegation of representatives from the ICC and CWI undertook a second inspection of the confirmed World Cup host countries in the Caribbean and host cities in the United States, also finalizing the fixtures for the tournament.\nOn 17 January 2024, the ICC unveiled the proposed design of the temporary Long Island stadium—Nassau County International Cricket Stadium—which is expected to be ready by the end of May 2024.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stage will consist of four groups of five teams, played as a single round-robin format in which the top two teams in each group will progress to the Super 8 stage.\nSuper 8s.\nAfter the group stage, the top two teams in each group will be placed into two groups of four teams in the Super 8 stage. This will be played as a single round-robin, with the top two teams in each group advancing to the knockout stage. If they advance from the group stage, seeded teams will be placed in pre-determined positions, regardless of whether they finish first or second in their group.\nGroup 2.\n \nMarketing.\nThe ICC hosted a \"trophy tour\" prior to the tournament which began on 19 March in New York City, the trophy is being taken to various locations around the world.\nOn 12 April, the ICC released a teaser of the official anthem of the tournament produced by Sean Paul and the lead singer of the Kes band, Kees Dieffenthaller.\nICC announced former T20 world champions Yuvraj Singh, Chris Gayle and Olympic Champion Usain Bolt as the Event Ambassadors for the tournament.\nReferences.\nICC Men’s T20 World Cup Schedule 2024: Venues, Teams And Fixtures"

        "text": "The 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Final was a day/night Twenty20 International cricket match played at Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai, UAE, on 14 November 2021 to determine the winner of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. It was played between New Zealand and Australia, with both the teams yet to win their first T20 World Cup title. Australia won the match by 8 wickets to win their maiden T20 World Cup title.\nBackground.\nOriginally, the preceding 2020 Men's T20 World Cup was scheduled to be held in Australia from 18 October to 15 November 2020, but was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic. Later, it was planned to be hosted by India as 2021 Men's T20 World Cup, with Australia being named as the host for the succeeding 2022 Men's T20 World Cup. In June 2021, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that the tournament was moved to UAE and Oman due to a possible third wave of the pandemic in India, with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) would remain as the hosts of the tournament irrespective of the location. Eight teams played in the First round as two groups A and B, with top two teams from each group advanced to the Super 12 stage. Super 12 stage was played in two groups 1 and 2, with the top two teams from each Super 12 group advanced to the semi-finals. After finishing second in the Super 12 Group 2, New Zealand became the first team to reach the final, by winning the first semi-final against England by five wickets. With the second-place finish in Super 12 Group 1, Australia beat Pakistan by 5 wickets in the second semi-final to reach the final.\nNew Zealand's Devon Conway was ruled out of his country's team after breaking his hand during the semi-final match against England.\nIt was a repeat of the 2015 World Cup Final where Australia defeated New Zealand to become world champions for the 5th time. This was New Zealand's first T20 World Cup final while Australia's second after 2010 where they lost to England. \nMatch details.\nMatch officials.\nSource:\nScorecard.\nFall of wickets: 1/28 (Mitchell, 3.5 ov), 2/76 (Guptill, 11.1 ov), 3/144 (Phillips, 17.2 ov), 4/148 (Williamson, 17.5 ov)\nFall of wickets: 1/15 (Finch, 2.3 ov), 2/107 (Warner, 12.2 ov)\nNew Zealand Innings.\nPut in to bat, New Zealand started off very well, with Daryl Mitchell and Martin Guptill scoring well against the Australian bowlers, helped along by a dropped catch from Matthew Wade. At 28 runs, Mitchell however, fell prey to Josh Hazelwood and was caught behind by Wade. Williamson then joined with Guptill and ensured Australia didn't pick any wickets until the 9th over. After a couple of boundaries to let loose, Williamson started scoring fast to keep up the run rate. In the 12th over, Zampa struck to remove Guptill, who was caught by Stoinis at deep mid-wicket for 28. Williamson then started scoring along with Glenn Phillips, targeting Marsh, Maxwell, and Starc for runs, the latter of which conceded the highest number of runs in a T20 World Cup final, giving away 60 runs in his four-over spell. Hazlewood struck again to remove Phillips and Williamson in the second and fifth ball of the 18th over, respectively. Neesham and Seifert scored at death overs to take New Zealand to a total of 172 for 4. Williamson top-scored for New Zealand with 85, equalling Marlon Samuel's record of 85* against England in 2016, in a T20 World Cup final.\nAustralian Innings.\nChasing 173 to win, Australia suffered a setback when Aaron Finch was caught in the deep off Boult for 5 (7) during the third ball of the 3rd over. Mitchell Marsh and David Warner joined and started to build a solid partnership against the New Zealand bowling. In the second ball of the 13th over, Boult managed to bowl Warner out for 53 (38). This dismissal meant that Warner missed out on becoming the top scorer for the tournament, his 289 runs coming up behind Pakistan's Babar Azam's 303 runs. With 66 runs needed from 46 balls, Marsh was joined by Maxwell. Maxwell reverse hit Southee for the winning runs, winning their maiden T20 World Cup with 7 balls to spare. By doing so, Australia had scored the highest total in a T20 World Cup final, passing the score of 161 for 6 scored by the West Indies against England in the 2016 edition. Marsh was acknowledged as the player of the match, while Warner won the Player of the Tournament. This is the third time overall that New Zealand had failed to win an ICC limited overs tournament, having failed to do so in the 2015 World Cup (against Australia) and 2019 World Cup (against England)."

AIBA also demanded the BFI pay a cancellation penalty of US$500,000.\nFor the first time in AIBA’s 75-year history, medal winners were awarded prize money; gold medallists earn $100,000, silver medallists $50,000, and bronze medallists $25,000. The overall prize fund was worth $2.6 million.\nControversies.\nThe Kosovo boxing team was prevented from competing at the tournament despite Serbia's hosting contract requiring Serbia to allow all teams to compete. (The contract further requires that all teams be allowed to compete under their own flags and explicitly includes Kosovo; AIBA recognizes the Kosovo Boxing Federation as a full member.) Two days prior to the tournament, the Kosovo boxing team was denied entry into Serbia at border control, effectively shutting them out of the tournament. During negotiations between AIBA and Serbia, Serbia stated to AIBA that Kosovo would not be allowed to compete except under the AIBA flag; this was rejected by Kosovo. One day prior to the tournament, AIBA suggested a compromise to Serbia where Kosovo would compete under \"a neutral flag\" (similar to Russia's situation); this was rejected by Serbia.\nIn December 2021 after the tournament, the International Olympic Committee sent a letter to Serbia condemning the incident.\nParticipating nations.\n510 athletes from 86 countries and two AIBA Fair Chance Teams participated in the championships:"

        "text": "Brian Ralph Jackson (born February 1, 1959) is an American former professional basketball player. After playing high school basketball in Palos Verdes Estates, California, Jackson played college basketball at Utah State, and was an all-conference selection in three of his four seasons there. He was selected in the second round (26th overall) of the 1981 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers but was waived before the start of the NBA season, and he moved to Europe where he played in Italy and most notably in Spain, where he was selected as an All-Star 4 times. While playing for Real Madrid he won 2 league titles, one Copa del Rey and one FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup, of which he also was the finals top scorer. He retired in 1995 after a 14-year career; in 2012 he was inducted in the Utah State Athletics Hall of Fame.\nHigh school career.\nJackson was born in Torrance, California and played basketball at Palos Verdes in Palos Verdes Estates, California under coach John Mihaljevich. He played the center position in high school, and in his senior year he was named a preseason all-American; in his last season at Palos Verdes he averaged 21 points and 15 rebounds per game.\nCollege career.\nJackson signed to play for Utah State in April 1977, and chose to wear jersey number 55. In his freshman year Jackson played 28 games, starting 11, and averaged 8.3 points, 5.5 rebounds and 0.8 assists in 22.7 minutes per game. On January 7, 1978 Jackson scored a career-high 24 points against BYU in a 84–85 loss. Jackson's sophomore year saw him being promoted to the starting lineup, and his 37.1 minutes per game were the best mark in the program history surpassing Ed Gregg's 37.0 in 1975–76. He averaged 15.7 points and 8.3 rebounds (second on his team in scoring and first in rebounding), and he was a 2nd team all-PCAA selection. On December 2, 1978 he recorded a new career-high 28 points against Western Michigan. Utah State qualified for the 1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament, facing USC in the first round: in a 86–67 loss Jackson recorded 17 points and 13 rebounds in 35 minutes of play.\nIn his junior year Jackson improved his scoring average to 20 points per game, and again he was the top rebounder of his team with 7 per game. At the end of the regular season he was a 2nd team all-PCAA selection for the second year in a row, and again he appeared in the NCAA Tournament. In the 1980 Tournament Utah State (11th seed in the West) faced Clemson, losing 76–73:Jackson scored 11 points and recorded 6 rebounds. Jackson's senior year saw his career-highs in scoring (23.4 points per game) and rebounding (8.9 per game), being the team leader in both categories. His 37.4 minutes per game were a new best mark in Utah State history at the time, surpassing his own record of 37.1 established in his sophomore year. He was also a 1st team all-PCAA selection, and made the PCAA All-Tournament team.\nHe recorded 1,903 points and 840 rebounds in his career at Utah State, 27 double-doubles, 96 starts in 113 games, and 3,768 total minutes. In 2012 Jackson was inducted in the Utah State Athletics Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nAfter the end of his senior season, Jackson was automatically eligible for the 1981 NBA draft, during which he was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the 3rd pick in the second round (26th overall). He participated in the Los Angeles Summer Pro Basketball League in 1981 with the Trail Blazers, but he was waived before the start of the 1981–82 NBA season. He then moved to Spain and signed for Primera División team Círcol Catòlic: in the 1981–82 season Jackson was second in the league in scoring with 29.5 points per game, behind Larry McNeil. In 1982 he moved to Italy, where he joined Reyer Venezia for the 1982–83 Lega Basket Serie A season.\nIn 1983 he moved back to Spain, and signed for Real Madrid. In his first season he averaged 23.9 points and 2.8 rebounds per game while shooting 59% from the field and 78% from the free throw line in 38.4 minutes per game. He then played 7 postseason games, averaging 25.3 points and 3 rebounds per game: he won the league title that year. In the same season Jackson participated in the FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup, and he also won that competition, being also the finals co-top scorer with Roberto Premier. In his second season with Real Madrid he won another league title, and also won the 1985 Copa del Rey. In the 1984–85 season he averaged 21.5 points and 4.6 rebounds in 34.7 minutes per game during regular season play, and 22.2 points in postseason play.\nIn 1985 he left Real Madrid and signed for Unione Ginnastica Goriziana, an Italian club which played in the Serie A2, the second level of Italian basketball. After spending the 1985–86 season there he went back to Spain in 1986, this time joining CB Peñas Huesca. He played 19 games in his first season with the club, averaging 22.5 points, 5.4 rebounds and 2.2 steals per game while shooting 57.9% from the field. In the following season he started to focus more on three-point shooting, going from 0.1 attempts the previous year to 1.3 attempts per game, and shot 40% from the three-point line. He averaged 24.6 points and 4.7 rebounds in 37.8 minutes per game. In the 1988–89 season he was selected as an All-Star for the first time in his career, and won the ACB Three-Point Shootout: he also played a career-high 40.1 minutes per game, shooting 48.5% from three on 2.9 attempts per game. In the 1989–90 season he shot a career-high 55.8% from the three-point line (92-of-165) over 36 league games, averaging 22.9 points and 4 rebounds. During his time at Peñas Huesca he was selected 4 times in the ACB All-Star team.\nIn 1992 he moved to CB Sevilla (named Caja San Fernando for sponsorship reasons) and in 1993 he was the first player in ACB history to record 6,000 points. At the end of his career in Spain in 1995 he had played 392 league games, scoring a total of 8,651 points, which ranked him first in league history until he was surpassed by Jordi Villacampa. As of 2019 he ranked third in ACB history for points scored behind Alberto Herreros and Jordi Villacampa."

        "text": "Tyler Johnson (born August 25, 1998) is an American football wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Minnesota, and was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the fifth round of the 2020 NFL Draft. He also briefly played for the Houston Texans.\nEarly years.\nJohnson attended North Community High School in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In high school, he played quarterback and defensive back. He committed to play college football at the University of Minnesota as a wide receiver, after receiving offers from Wisconsin, Iowa, and Iowa State.\nCollege career.\nAs a true freshman at Minnesota in 2016, Johnson played in all 13 games with one start and had 14 receptions for 141 yards and one touchdown. As a sophomore in 2017, he started the first ten games of the season before suffering an injury which cost him the final two games. He ended the season with 35 catches for 677 yards and seven touchdowns. As a junior in 2018, Johnson started all 13 games, recording 78 receptions for school records 1,169 yards and 12 touchdowns. He was voted First-Team All-Big Ten Conference by the media, and Second-Team by the coaches. Johnson returned to Minnesota for his senior season in 2019 rather than enter the 2019 NFL Draft. In his senior season, Johnson caught 86 passes for 1,318 yards and 13 touchdowns, all of which led the Big Ten and set new single-season school records. This earned him First-Team All-Big Ten honors. His season was capped by a 12-reception, 204-yard, two-touchdown performance against Auburn in the Outback Bowl, and he was named the 2020 Outback Bowl MVP. His 12 catches were tied for the 3rd most by a Minnesota receiver in one game, and his 204 yards were the second-most by a Minnesota receiver in one game. Johnson left Minnesota second all-time in receptions, with 213, and the all-time leader in both receiving yards, with 3,305, and receiving touchdowns, with 33.\nProfessional career.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (first stint).\nJohnson was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 161st pick in the fifth round of the 2020 NFL Draft. In Week 5 of the 2020 season, he recorded his first four career receptions for 61 receiving yards in the 20–19 loss to the Chicago Bears. In Week 6 against the Green Bay Packers, he scored his first professional receiving touchdown on a seven-yard reception from Tom Brady. Overall, Johnson finished his rookie season with 12 receptions for 169 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in 14 games. Johnson drew a critical, game-sealing pass-interference penalty on Packers cornerback Kevin King in the National Football Conference Championship game, which the Bucs won 31–26 to advance to Super Bowl LV, where they won 31–9 over the Kansas City Chiefs. Johnson earned a single target in the win.\nThe Buccaneers waived Johnson on August 30, 2022.\nHouston Texans.\nOn August 31, 2022, Johnson was claimed off waivers by the Houston Texans. He was released on October 25.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (second stint).\nOn October 31, 2022, Johnson was signed to the Buccaneers practice squad.\nLas Vegas Raiders.\nOn January 25, 2023, Johnson signed a reserve/future contract with the Las Vegas Raiders. He was waived on May 15, 2023.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nOn May 30, 2023, Johnson signed with the Los Angeles Rams. He was waived on August 29, 2023 and re-signed to the practice squad. He was promoted to the active roster on January 2, 2024."

        "text": "The men's road time trial event at the 2020 Summer Olympics took place on 28 July 2021 around the Fuji Speedway in the Shizuoka Prefecture. 39 cyclists from 31 nations competed in the race, with everyone bar one rider eventually finishing.\nThe race was won by Primož Roglič of Slovenia. Roglič was around half a second behind the world champion, Filippo Ganna of Italy, at the first time check before eventually pulling ahead. He led by eight seconds at the end of the first lap before continuing to increase his lead towards the finish. He won by 1' 01\" over Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands. Dumoulin was third at the first time check, eventually engaging in a close battle for the silver medal, with less than five seconds separating the four riders behind Roglič. The bronze medal went to Rohan Dennis of Australia, a further two and a half seconds from Dumoulin.\nBackground.\nThis will be the 12th appearance of the event, previously held at every Summer Olympics from 1912 to 1932 before being replaced by the (mass start) road race; the men's time trial returned in 1996 and has been held at every Summer Olympics since. The reigning Olympic champion is Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, who retired from professional cycling in 2016 and therefore won't be able to defend its title. The reigning World Champion is Filippo Ganna of Italy.\nAn event preview from Olympics.com predicted difficulty for flat time trial specialists due to the hilly course and identified the following as favourites:\nFroome had earned Olympic bronze in the event in 2012 and 2016.\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to 2 qualified cyclists in the men's road time trial. All quota places are assigned to the NOC, which may select the cyclists that compete. The time trial quota places did not allow NOCs to send additional cyclists; NOCs had to have qualified places in the road race to earn time trial quota places. There were 40 total quota spots available for the race, allocated as follows:\nCompetition format and course.\nThe time trial is a race against the clock. The 39 competing cyclists were divided into three groups, with 13 riders in each group. The riders started at a minute and a half intervals while the interval between each group was 38 minutes. The time trial events used a circuit that began on the Fuji Speedway before descending towards the exit. Afterwards, the riders gradually climbed for towards the first intermediate time check. The riders then began another descent towards the second time check, looping back towards the entrance of the Speedway. After passing through the entrance, the riders tackled a climb before going inside the Speedway proper. The riders rode through the Speedway before the lap ended on the finish line. The men rode this circuit twice for a total distance of . The elevation gain was approximately .\nStart list.\nNations:\nRace overview.\nThe time trial commenced at 14:00 Japan Standard Time (UTC+9) with Ahmad Wais (Refugee Olympic Team) the first rider off the start ramp. The first rider to set a fast time was Hugo Houle (Canada), with a time of 57:56.46. Stefan de Bod (South Africa) threatened his time but he eventually fell short by less than a second. No other rider in the first group threatened his time as Houle stayed in the hot seat until the next group of riders took to the course.\nAs the second group of riders started their rides, three riders challenged Houle's time: Remco Evenepoel (Belgium), Alberto Bettiol (Italy), and Rigoberto Urán (Colombia). At the first time check, Evenepoel was six seconds off Houle's time while Urán was 16 seconds down. Bettiol soon set the fastest time at the first time check, five seconds ahead of Houle. At the end of the first lap, Evenepoel and Urán were four and five seconds down on Houle, respectively. Meanwhile, Bettiol faded towards the end of the first lap, finishing the lap with a deficit of 21 seconds. All three riders began to edge ahead of Houle as they rode through the second lap. Evenepoel was the first rider to knock Houle off the top spot, finishing 35 seconds faster. Bettiol was almost 17 seconds slower than Evenepoel at the finish before Urán pushed Evenepoel into provisional second, finishing around two and a half seconds faster than the Belgian.\nThe final group of riders soon took to the course. The first rider to threaten Urán's time was Tom Dumoulin (Netherlands). Dumoulin was around 16 seconds faster than Bettiol's time at the first time check before his time was beaten by Primož Roglič (Slovenia), who was two and a half seconds faster. Rohan Dennis (Australia), Stefan Küng (Switzerland), and Wout van Aert (Belgium) were less than 10 seconds behind Roglič's time at the first time check before the world champion, Filippo Ganna (Italy), was half a second faster than Roglič. As the riders finished the first lap, Roglič ended up taking the top spot, with no other rider within eight seconds of his time. In the second lap, Roglič gradually built his advantage as he maintained his pace while the other riders began to fade. The battle for the silver and bronze medals also intensified as Dumoulin, Dennis, Küng, and Ganna were within five seconds of each other for most of the time. Kasper Asgreen (Denmark) and van Aert also faded in the second lap, losing considerable time. At the finish, Dumoulin was the first rider to knock Urán off the top spot, finishing more than a minute ahead. However, Roglič immediately beat Dumoulin's time as he finished with a time of 55:04.19, more than a minute ahead of Dumoulin. No one would threaten Roglič's time as he took the gold medal. Dennis came close to beating Dumoulin but he fell short by two and a half seconds to go into provisional third. Küng was also challenging the times of Dumoulin and Dennis before finishing at less than half a second from Dennis's time. The last rider to finish was Ganna. He eventually came in at almost two seconds down on Dennis, finishing without a medal. Thus, the silver medal went to Dumoulin while the bronze medal went to Dennis."

        "text": "The women's road time trial event at the 2020 Summer Olympics took place on 28 July 2021 around the Fuji Speedway in Shizuoka Prefecture. 25 cyclists from 20 nations competed in the event.\nThe race was won by Annemiek van Vleuten of Netherlands, her second Olympic medal at these Games. Van Vleuten set the fastest times at both intermediate time checks before setting the only time under 31 minutes. She won by 56 seconds over the silver medalist, Marlen Reusser of Switzerland. Reusser set the fourth and fifth fastest times at the first two time checks, respectively. Her final split allowed her to move into second, becoming the only rider within a minute of van Vleuten's time. The bronze medal went to Anna van der Breggen, the world champion and van Vleuten's compatriot. She was faster than Reusser at both time checks before Reusser eventually moved ahead by five seconds at the finish.\nBackground.\nThis was the 7th appearance of the event, previously held at every Summer Olympics since 1996. The reigning Olympic champion was Kristin Armstrong of the United States who retired in 2016. The reigning World Champion was Anna van der Breggen of the Netherlands.\nAn event preview from Olympics.com identified the Dutch team of van der Breggen and Annemiek van Vleuten as difficult to beat while Chloé Dygert, the world champion in the discipline in 2019, was also noted as a potential favourite if healthy.\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to 2 qualified cyclists in the women's road time trial. All quota places are assigned to the NOC, which may select the cyclists that compete. The time trial quota places did not allow NOCs to send additional cyclists; NOCs had to have qualified places in the road race to earn time trial quota places. There were 25 total quota spots available for the race, allocated as follows:\nCompetition format and course.\nThe time trial is a race against the clock. The 25 competing cyclists started at intervals of a minute and a half. The time trial events used a circuit that began on the Fuji Speedway before descending towards the exit. Afterwards, the riders gradually climbed for towards the first intermediate time check. The riders then began another descent towards the second time check, looping back towards the entrance of the Speedway. After passing through the entrance, the riders tackled a climb before going inside the Speedway proper. The riders rode through the Speedway before the lap ended on the finish line. The women rode this circuit once with an elevation gain of approximately .\nStart list.\nNations:\nRace overview.\nThe time trial commenced at 11:30 Japan Standard Time (UTC+9) with Masomah Ali Zada (Refugee Olympic Team) the first rider off the start ramp. The first rider to set a benchmark time was Karol-Ann Canuel (Canada). She set a time of 33:07.97, which stood until Sarah Gigante (Australia) finished with a time of 33:01.60. Two riders, Leah Kirchmann (Canada) and Lisa Klein (Germany), came close to beating Gigante's time but both riders fell short by less than half a second. Gigante was eventually knocked off the top spot by Juliette Labous (France), who set the first time under 33 minutes with a time of 32:42.14. She was soon beaten by Ashleigh Moolman Pasio, who was four and a half seconds faster than Labous.\nThe favorites soon started the course, beginning with Amber Neben (United States). She set a time of 31:26.13, the first time under 32 minutes. However, just behind her, Annemiek van Vleuten (Netherlands) was speeding up the course. She was the fastest at both intermediate time checks before finishing with a time of 30:13.49, the only time under 31 minutes. Her time eventually stood until the end, winning the gold medal as a follow-up to her silver medal finish at the road race. Grace Brown (Australia) looked to threaten van Vleuten's time as she was only six seconds slower at the first time check. However, she gradually lost time towards the rest of the course before eventually going more than a minute slower. The last three riders off the start ramp were Marlen Reusser (Switzerland), Chloé Dygert (United States), and Anna van der Breggen (Netherlands). At the first time check, Reusser was only fourth fastest at 28 seconds down while van der Breggen was third fastest, only 18 seconds behind. Meanwhile, Dygert struggled from the start as she was 51 seconds down at the first time check before eventually setting the seventh fastest time. At the second time check, van der Breggen and Reusser continued to lose time, going 29 and 42 seconds slower, respectively. At the finish, Reusser was able to move into second to take the silver medal by five seconds over van der Breggen, who took the bronze medal."

Saints dominated the first half by scoring four tries to Wigan's one and led 26–6 at half-time with tries from Theo Fages, Kevin Naiqama, Luke Thompson, and Jonny Lomax.\nWigan knew they had a job to do in the 2nd half, but this was not to be, as Saints Zeb Taia's score and a Mark Percival double extended the lead to send Saints to their first grand final since 2014.\nThis was also Justin Holbrook's final game for Saints at the Totally Wicked Stadium, without losing a single home game all season. He will leave at the end of the season, as he prepares to take on the vacant coaching role at Gold Coast Titans and will be replaced by Kristian Woolf for the 2020 Season.\nSalford Red Devils.\nSalford finished 3rd in the regular season, to earn an away tie against 2nd place Wigan Warriors in the qualifying finals, only to lose 18–12.\nThis meant that Salford would get another chance against Castleford in the Elimination-final, this time there was no mistakes, as they went on to win the match 22–0, thus setting up another tie against Wigan in the preliminary final.\nSalford opened the scoring on 2 minutes, as Lee Mossop had the ball stolen, and Krisnan Inu slotted over a penalty goal from 40m out. Wigan were again penalised in the 7th minute, for offside and Inu slotted over another penalty to make it 4–0. The video referee was called into action in the 13th minute, as Gil Dudson went over for the visitors, but referee Ben Thaler couldn't decide whether it was a double movement or not. The try was awarded and Inu added the extras to give Salford a 10–0 lead after 15 minutes.\nThe visitors extended their lead further in the 45th minute, Joey Lussick crashing over from close range, the try awarded after much deliberation from the video referee. Inu adding another conversion to give Salford an 18–0 lead.\nInu added a fifth penalty goal of the evening in the 65th minute, before the Warriors finally got their first score of the game in the 72nd minute, Oliver Gildart made the initial break, before being captured out by good vision from Sean O’Loughlin, saw the skipper put a kick through for Bevan French, to win the foot race and ease over. Zak Hardaker hit the uprights with the conversion attempt and it was 28–4 to the visitors.\nSalford won, and earned them a first ever appearance at the grand final.\nMatch details.\nSt Helens opened the scoring through Morgan Knowles, receiving a short ball from Alex Walmsley to crash over to the left of the posts. Coote converted to give Saints a 6–0 lead.\nThe runaway league leaders continued their early dominance, crossing the line again through Zeb Taia following a brilliantly crafted short side scrum play. Coote converted once more to extend the lead to 12–0.\nThe resilient Salford side hit back just after the half hour mark, Jake Bibby finishing off a clever blind side switch in the corner, converted by Krisnan Inu to reduce the score to 12–6 at Half Time.\nMark Percival then crossed early in the 2nd half, chasing his own delicately weighted kick to score in front of the raucous Stretford End. Coote converted to restore Saints lead to 12 points at 18–6.\nTwo more Coote penalties extended the scoreline to 22–6 in favour of the Saints, before Tommy Makinson kicked a 40m drop goal to seal a 23–6 win and clinch St Helens their 7th Super League Title."

        "title": "2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan",
        "text": "On November 6, 2001, the owners of the 30 teams in Major League Baseball (MLB) voted 28–2 to eliminate two teams for the 2002 season. The two teams expected to be eliminated, the Minnesota Twins and the Montreal Expos, cast the dissenting votes. According to Commissioner Bud Selig, the decision was made due to economic reasons, as \"the teams to be contracted [had] a long record of failing to generate enough revenues to operate a viable major league franchise.\" Also factoring into the contraction plan was the two teams' inability to fund the construction of new ballparks to replace the outdated Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Olympic Stadium.\nThe contraction plan fell through due to a court injunction compelling the Twins to honor their lease with the Metrodome, as well as challenges by the players' labor union, the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). The Expos were later purchased by Major League Baseball. The Twins eventually secured funding for a new stadium that opened in 2010, while the Expos relocated to Washington, D.C. in 2005 and were renamed the Washington Nationals, later being purchased by Ted Lerner and moving to a new stadium of their own.\nIf the plan had gone through, it would have been the first contraction by a major North American professional sports league since the National Hockey League merged the Cleveland Barons into the Minnesota North Stars in 1978, and the first contraction by Major League Baseball since 1899.\nBackground.\nMinnesota Twins.\nThe Minnesota Twins began playing at the Metrodome in the 1982 season after playing for 21 seasons at Metropolitan Stadium. During their tenure at the Metrodome, the Twins won the World Series in and . Nevertheless, the multipurpose stadium, which the Twins shared with the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, had poor sightlines when the field was set for baseball, and the Twins received no revenue from signage, luxury suites, or parking. Additionally, the white, air-supported roof not only caused many fielders to have trouble tracking fly balls, but it also deflated due to heavy snow on numerous occasions.\nBy the start of the 1990s, the Metrodome was already considered obsolete. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Twins were often rumored to be moving to such places as Sacramento, California; Orlando, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; and others in search of a more financially competitive market. In 1997, the team came close to an agreement to move to North Carolina, but the deal was not completed.\nThere was also some speculation that Selig targeted the Twins because of his family's ownership of the Milwaukee Brewers, the next closest team to the Twin Cities, and which was set to potentially gain the Twins' market should the team be dissolved.\nMontreal Expos.\nOlympic Stadium was originally constructed as a multipurpose venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics, which Montreal hosted. The Montreal Expos began playing full-time at the stadium in the 1977 season, one year after the stadium's opening and the team's ninth year of play. Although the new stadium was an upgrade from Jarry Park Stadium, Olympic Stadium was still fraught with problems. A retractable roof that was scheduled to be finished when the Expos moved in was not finished until 1987, and began to leak within only a few years. In 1991, support beams collapsed and a 55-ton slab of concrete crashed onto a walkway outside the stadium, forcing the Expos to play their final 13 home games that year on the road.\nThe stadium's poor conditions contributed to low attendance in Montreal. Throughout the 1990s, the Expos ranked near the bottom in the NL for attendance, including ranking last in each of their final seven seasons in Montreal. Owner Jeffrey Loria was unable to reach an agreement for television and English-speaking radio coverage to increase the team's broadcasting revenue, and his proposal for a new downtown ballpark was rebuffed by the Quebec government.\nOwners vote for contraction.\nOn November 6, 2001, the day before the active MLB labor agreement expired, MLB franchise owners met in Chicago to vote on contraction, despite earlier reports that no such vote would take place. The owners voted 28–2 in favor of contraction. Although the Florida Marlins, Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Oakland Athletics had been discussed as candidates for elimination, the Expos and Twins were considered the likeliest teams to be folded. The owners of both teams were set to receive $250 million buyouts to let MLB take control of and fold their franchises. The plan also included division realignment so that each league would have an even number of teams. In the plan, the Texas Rangers would move to the American League Central, the Pittsburgh Pirates would move to the National League East, and the Arizona Diamondbacks would move to the American League West.\nAftermath.\nMajor League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) executive director Donald Fehr noted that the players' union had no say in the matter and called the decision \"imprudent and unfortunate...We had hoped that we were in a new era, one that would see a much better relationship between players and owners. Today's announcement is a severe blow to such hopes.\" The MLBPA filed a grievance to block contraction the day after the vote. On November 16, the league's contraction plans were shelved when Hennepin County Judge Harry Crump ruled that the Minnesota Twins must honor their lease and play their final season at the Metrodome, citing the team's importance to the community. Had only the Expos been contracted, there would have been an odd number of teams in the two leagues, meaning one team would have to be idle every day. This would have made it all but impossible to preserve a 162-game schedule within the normal six-month season.\nBy December 13, talks about contraction had ended, and on January 12, 2002, it was announced that no teams would be eliminated for the upcoming season.\nOn January 16, Loria sold the Expos to Major League Baseball for $120 million. MLB formed Expos Baseball L.P., a partnership of the other 29 clubs, to operate the Expos. Loria then bought the Florida Marlins from John W. Henry for $158 million, using the proceeds from the Expos sale plus a $38.5 million no-interest loan from MLB. Henry then bought the Boston Red Sox from the Yawkey Trust. It was officially announced on February 5 that plans for contraction had been abandoned. On August 30, the owners and players approved a new collective bargaining agreement that forbade contraction until 2006.\nWith no plans for a new ballpark in Montreal, Major League Baseball looked into relocating the Expos. Cities that expressed interest in the team included Washington, D.C.; Las Vegas, Nevada; Norfolk, Virginia; Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico; and Portland, Oregon. On September 29, 2004, Major League Baseball announced that the Expos would relocate to Washington, D.C. for the 2005 season. MLB owners voted 28–1 in favor of the move, with the Baltimore Orioles casting the lone dissenting vote. The team, re-branded as the Washington Nationals and being sold to Ted Lerner in 2006, played their first three seasons at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium before moving into the newly constructed Nationals Park in 2008.\nOn May 26, 2006, after years of failed proposals, Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty signed a bill that approved funding for a new $522 million ballpark, to which the Twins agreed to contribute $130 million. The new stadium, named Target Field, opened in April 2010."

        "text": "The men's horizontal bar competition at the 1952 Summer Olympics was held at Töölö Sports Hall, Exhibition Hall I from 19 to 21 July. It was the eighth appearance of the event. There were 185 competitors from 29 nations, with each nation sending up to 8 gymnasts. The event was won by Jack Günthard of Switzerland, the nation's second consecutive and third overall victory in the horizontal bar, breaking a tie with the United States for most all-time. Switzerland also took one of the silver medals, as Josef Stalder tied with Alfred Schwarzmann of Germany, competing at the age of 40, for second. Stalder and Schwarzmann were the first two men to win multiple horizontal bars medals; Stalder had won the event in 1948 and Schwarzmann had earned bronze in 1936.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Four of the top 10 gymnasts from 1948 returned: gold medalist Josef Stalder of Switzerland, fourth-place finishers Raymond Dot of France and Lajos Sántha of Hungary, and ninth-place finisher Lajos Tóth of Hungary. 1936 bronze medalist Alfred Schwarzmann of Germany (unable to compete in 1948 due to the exclusion of the World War II aggressor nations) also returned. Hans Eugster of Switzerland was the reigning (1950) world champion; Dot had finished third after Eugster and Olavi Rove of Finland.\nBelgium, India, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Saar, South Africa, the Soviet Union, Spain, and Sweden each made their debut in the men's horizontal bar. The United States made its seventh appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games. Of the 22 different nations that had competed at least once in the event before 1952, 19 competed in Helsinki (only Greece, Mexico, and the Netherlands were missing among the nations having previously competed).\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format. Each nation entered a team of between five and eight gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The 2 exercise scores were summed to give a total for the apparatus.\nNo separate finals were contested.\nFor each exercise, four judges gave scores from 0 to 10 in one-tenth point increments. The top and bottom scores were discarded and the remaining two scores averaged to give the exercise total. Thus, exercise scores ranged from 0 to 10 and apparatus scores from 0 to 20.\nThe competitor had the option to make a second try only on the compulsory exercise—with the second attempt counting regardless of whether it was better than the first."

        "text": "Cameron Hughes (born October 9, 1996) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player currently playing for the Coachella Valley Firebirds of the American Hockey League (AHL) as a prospect for the Seattle Kraken of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPersonal life.\nHughes was born on October 9, 1996, in Edmonton Alberta, to parents Brian and Pauline. Hughes is the oldest of three brothers; Ryan, Liam, and Ethan, who all play ice hockey. Growing up in Edmonton, Hughes played with the Canadian Athletic Club Midget Hockey program of the Alberta Midget Hockey League (AMHL) and the Spruce Grove Saints of the Alberta Junior Hockey League. During his time in the AMHL, Hughes was drafted by the Swift Current Broncos of the Western Hockey League (WHL). Instead of joining the Broncos, he played with the Saints and tallied 31 points in 60 regular season games and 9 points in 14 playoff games as he helped the Saints to the AJHL finals. In 2014, Hughes was named to the Reebok North Division All-League Team. Later that year, he committed to play collegiate ice hockey for the Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey team.\nPlaying career.\nHughes played for the Wisconsin Badgers at the University of Wisconsin from 2014 to 2018. There, he majored in agricultural and applied economics/agricultural business management. The Badgers had a disappointing 2014–15 season and began the year with the second-worst record amongst the 59 schools competing in NCAA Division I. As a result, during the winter break, Hughes debated joining the Broncos in the WHL instead of returning to college. However, he returned to the University of Wisconsin and finished the season with three goals and 10 assists for 13 points through 34 games. Following his freshman season, Hughes was ranked 196th overall amongst North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. He was eventually drafted 165th overall by the Boston Bruins in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft.

        "title": "Call of Duty League",
        "text": "The Call of Duty League (CDL) is a professional esports league for the video game series \"Call of Duty\", produced by its publisher Activision. The Call of Duty League follows the model of the Overwatch League as well as other traditional North American professional sporting leagues by using a set of permanent, city-based teams backed by separate ownership groups. In addition, the league plays in a tournament point system and playoffs format rather than the use of promotion and relegation used commonly in other esports and non-North American leagues, with players on the roster being assured a minimum annual salary, benefits, and a portion of winnings and revenue-sharing based on how that team performs. The League was announced in 2019 with its inaugural season starting in 2020.\nFormat.\nThe Call of Duty League is owned by Activision Blizzard and is the company's second franchise-based esports league. The league plays out similar to most North American professional sports leagues, in which all teams play scheduled games against other teams to vie for position in the season's playoffs, rather than the approach of team promotion and relegation more commonly used in other esports leagues. The league currently features twelve teams.\nEach match involves two teams in a best-of-five through different games based on gameplay modes and maps within the \"Call of Duty\" game. The game used depends on the most recent installment of the series, such as being used for the 2023 season.\nIn the inaugural season, the three multiplayer modes used by the CDL include: \"Search &amp; Destroy\", where one team attempts to plant a bomb and defend it at one of two control points while the other team tries to eliminate the bomb team, or if the bomb is activated, to defuse it in time; \"Hardpoint\", where a rotation control point appears on the map, and teams earn points for maintaining control on that point; and \"Domination\", where three control points appear on the map, and teams are awarded points by maintaining control of one or more of these points. In the case of \"Search &amp; Destroy\" and \"Domination\", multiple rounds are played, switching the role of each team, while \"Hardpoint\" is played until a point limit is reached. Once a team has won three games in a match, the match is over, and that team given the match victory. Coaches for teams have a limited number of time outs which they can use during a game, and can substitute players during this time; this is in contrast to the OWL format where play substitutions may only occur between games.\nThe 2020 season schedule is evenly divided into two splits for spring and summer, with a mid-season all-star event taking place after the spring split, and culminates in the Championship Weekend. Each team will host a weekend tournament-style event in their home city, and the top teams from the weekend earns points. The top eight teams at the end of season based on points claim a berth in the playoffs. A total prize pool is available to teams in the inaugural season. To standardize play at each homestand weekend, Activision constructed a transportable esports stage with input from each of the teams. To support viewership, Activision studios Infinity Ward and Beenox created a server architecture for the \"Call of Duty\" games, the CODCaster, that enables a match to be viewed from multiple different angles and identify which angles have the most exciting action to follow, as to allow the commentators and producers of the broadcast events to help show key action in the match. CODCaster also compiles key in-game statistics, and is able to render the team's characters in their team's colors for the viewing audience, though players themselves will not have this benefit.\nEach team must have a minimum of seven players with a maximum of ten. Players are guaranteed a minimum salary with health and other benefits, though players may negotiate for higher salaries. At least 50% of the winnings a team earns must be shared with the team members. Players are not required to live in the city/region that the team represents. Teams are not required to providing housing for players during the season, and if they do not choose to offer it, the team must instead offer a means and stipend to help players to find such housing with approval from Activision.\nActivision also established a Call of Duty Challengers series for amateur players to compete in matches and potentially be played into teams that vie for a prize pool alongside the main League season. This provides the League teams with a pool of talent that they can draw from for their teams.\nSince the 2021 season, the Call of Duty League uses a 4v4 format instead of 5v5 in the previous season. \"Domination\" was replaced by \"Control\", where one team attempts to capture two points on the map, while the other team defends them. The round can end with the attackers capturing both zones within the allotted time, the defenders winning by the time expiring or by either team killing the other thirty times.\nThe schedule is also split into five stages, with each ending with a Major Tournament. In each stage the teams are split into groups, determined by the teams themselves, via a draft system. Every team competes in each homestand event with the finals of each event being a meeting between teams from the opposite group. During each homestand teams will earn CDL points and the top eight teams at the end of the season will enter the playoffs to compete for the CDL Championship.\nCall of Duty Challengers.\nChallengers is the amateur division of competitive Call of Duty. Challengers contains all of the up-and-coming players that are striving to enter the official Call of Duty League. The 2020 Challengers season offered a massive prize pool of $1,000,000 to be given out through a series of tournaments. The Challengers division is run through a format of \"Pro points\" or \"Challenger points\" which are virtual points given out to people based on their placing in tournaments. Owing to the vast number of people trying to make it to the Call of Duty League, it would be very difficult to find the best players without the addition of these points. This allows for franchised teams such as Optic Gaming or Seattle Surge to have academy teams equipped with the best players in Challengers. This allow for greater branding and the players based on the placing of their academy teams.\nThe events for Challengers are held offline in special locations. The dates of these events is in accordance to the actual Call of Duty League events. The first event of Modern Warfare was the Minnesota Launch Weekend event where there were professional pro league matches being played as well as Challengers events being held. However, before the first LAN (Local Area Network) event during that weekend. Challengers players have to play in two online ladder tournaments to compete for Challengers points. This points are individual to each person and the sum of those points in accordance to everyone else on the team decides the seeding for the LAN events at home series events. However, in the middle of the 2020 season and beginning in the 2021 season, Challengers will be played in an online format due to the COVID-19 virus. This has changed the format to where players will play in a \"Cup\" or tournament every weekend in order to compete for prizes and pro points. On top of the cups, the home series events will also be played online as compared to when they were played on LAN in the beginning of the MW season.\nLeague advertising and viewership.\nActivision Blizzard, the publishers of the Call of Duty series launched the Call of Duty League and focused on a plan to try to make the league as presentable as possible. They first started the league by announcing a partnership with Google to allow YouTube Gaming to have exclusive streaming rights for all of their leagues. This was a major announcement as this was the major way that spectators would be able to watch the league from home. This was especially advantageous when the CDL went to online only due to the COVID-19 virus. The growth of the league coincides with the growth of Activision Blizzard. In comparison to the Overwatch League, the CDL has made a lot more revenue and has reached a larger audience due to several aspects. The Overwatch League which is Activision Blizzard's other franchised league, did not report any substantial or revenue growth for the game itself as well as for the league. As compared to the CDL, which is based on the legendary gaming franchise Call of Duty. Even for the 2020 CDL Modern Warfare season, the game ended up being the top-selling game of the year with 172 million downloads and $87 million in global consumer spending in the first two months of release.\nHistory.\nIn February 2019, Activision Blizzard officially confirmed their intention to launch a city-based, franchised league for \"Call of Duty\", marking their second such organization following the Overwatch League, founded in 2017. To prepare for establishing the League, Activision terminated both the Call of Duty Pro League and Call of Duty World League in mid-2019.\nThe first five teams to purchase a spot for the league was announced in May 2019; the companies – OverActive Media, Atlanta Esports Ventures, Envy Gaming, c0ntact Gaming LLC, and Sterling.VC – were also parent companies for teams in Activision Blizzard's other franchised league, the Overwatch League. All twelve franchises were finalized in October 2019, with a majority of the franchised having never professionally competed in \"Call of Duty\". \"The Washington Post\" estimated that the franchise cost was .\nInitially, the CDL announced that they would be running a regular season format culminating in postseason playoffs. However, after criticism from the \"Call of Duty\" esports community, the league elected to switch to a tournament system, which was officially announced in January 2020.\nIn the days prior to the launch of the inaugural season, Activision announced it had made a multiyear deal with Google for all of its esports content, including the CDL, to be exclusively shown through YouTube. Prior Activision esports, particularly OWL, had used Twitch. Activision also announced other official sponsors of the league on eve of the first season: On March 9, Activision announced partnerships with both Twitter and the United States Army.\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn March 13, 2020, the Call of Duty League released a statement entailing that all live home series events were cancelled due to concerns over the novel COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak, to which they said that upcoming events will be done via online play and possibly return to live events if logistically and feasibly possible. On May 19, 2020, the Call of Duty League announced changes to the 2020 Call of Duty League Championship. Instead of 8 teams making it to the Championship weekend all 12 teams would now compete for the Championship in a double-elimination tournament. A prize pool was announced, with the winning team taking home .\nOn July 5, 2020, the Call of Duty league announced that the postseason would also be played online as a result of the pandemic. Additional measures to further protect the competitive integrity of the league were also announced. All competitors are to be provided with a universal camera which will need to be activated throughout all matches with the camera providing league officials visibility each competitor's console, controller and monitor.\nDepartment of Justice lawsuit and settlement.\nOn April 3, 2023 the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit and Activision Blizzard agreed to settle the suit on the same day, with provisions that would prohibit it from implementing a salary cap or luxury tax, or any other measure that would unfairly depress player salaries in the Overwatch League, the Call of Duty League, or any other esports league.\nTeams.\nThe Call of Duty League follows the model of the Overwatch League as well as other traditional North American professional sporting leagues by using a set of permanent, city-based teams backed by separate ownership groups. The CDL launched in January 2020 with twelve teams, each based in a global city. Of the twelve teams, nine are based in the United States, while the remaining three are based in Canada, the United Kingdom, and France.\nOn November 6, 2020, 100 Thieves announced that they would join the league under the name of the Los Angeles Thieves after acquiring the slot vacated by OpTic Gaming Los Angeles. For the 2021 season, the Chicago Huntsmen franchise was rebranded to OpTic Chicago as Hector ‘H3CZ’ Rodriguez successfully reacquires the OpTic Gaming brand.\nFollowing the 2021 season, OpTic Gaming and Envy Gaming announced a merger. As a result, the Dallas Empire franchise was rebranded to OpTic Texas, while the former Chicago spot was put up for sale, which the Kraft Group later acquired. With this, the Boston Breach was announced as the new team heading into the 2022 season.\nOn June 1, 2022, the Paris Legion announced that following the 2022 season, the franchise would be relocating to Las Vegas heading into the 2023 season, rebranding the franchise to the Vegas Legion.\nOn August 24, 2023, the Florida Mutineers announced that the franchise would be rebranded to the Miami Heretics following a partnership with Spanish esports organization Team Heretics.\nOn September 5, 2023, the London Royal Ravens announced a relocation to Charlotte, North Carolina, rebranding the franchise to the Carolina Royal Ravens.\nLeague Championships.\nAs of the 2023 season, 14 different teams have competed in the league, with four having won at least one Grand Finals title.\nStage Titles.\nThis is a list of each team by stage titles won. Stage titles are won by being the champion of the major at the end of the stage. Stage titles started with the 2021 season.\nSeasons.\n2020.\nThe regular season began January 24 and continued through July 2020, with a two-week post season playoffs to crown the season winners in August. Teams were due to hold in person tournaments in their respective cities with a rotation of eight of the 12 teams in attendance for each event. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic only 3 homestand style events were held, with team owners and players voting to have the league move online for the remainder of the season. The Grand Finals were held online, on August 30, in which the regular season number 2 seed Dallas Empire defeated the regular season number 1 seed Atlanta FaZe 5–1 to become the first Call of Duty League champions.\n2021.\nThe 2021 season had a similar structure to the previous season. However, some things changed and updated since the last season. This season had several stages where teams were randomly picked and put into groups to play each other in official matches for CDL points which dictated the seeds for the teams in the CDL major events when they happened. The CDL points decide if a team starts in the losers or winners bracket at the start of the tournament. To start off the 2021 season group selections, the 2020 CDL champions Dallas Empire made the first pick of the teams they want in their group and the runner up at the 2020 CDL championships Atlanta Faze made the 2nd pick. There was a snake draft between those two teams until all teams were put into a group. In addition, the top two finishing teams in stage 1 were then the two teams for group selection in stage 2. The 2021 season consisted of 5 stages until the CDL playoffs which is the biggest tournament with the biggest prize pool."

It was head coach Mark Pope's first season as BYU's head coach and the Cougars ninth season as members of the West Coast Conference (WCC). The Cougars played their home games at the Marriott Center in Provo, Utah. They finished the season 24–8, 13–3 in WCC play to finish in second place.

Shortly after the season ended, longtime head coach Dave Rose announced his retirement. Utah Valley head coach Mark Pope, who previously spent four seasons as an assistant at BYU under Rose, was hired in April to be his replacement. Later in April, Pope announced that he had selected Chris Burgess and Cody Fueger from Utah Valley and Nick Robinson from Southern Utah as his assistant coaches. Average home game attendance for the 16 games played at the Marriott Center for the 2018–19 season was 11,958. This was the second highest attendance in the West behind Arizona and ranked 27th nationwide.\nOffseason.\nDepartures.\nDuring the 2018–19 season, BYU had two seniors that finished their eligibility to play college basketball - McKay Cannon and Luke Worthington. Two years passed since BYU had seniors as part of a basketball team. McKay Cannon transferred to BYU from Weber State University.

A month later in August, Hardnett decided to transfer to the University of Missouri-Kansas City and will be eligible to play immediately. Rylan Bergersen transferred to the University of Central Arkansas, a Division I program, with two years of eligibility remaining. Bergersen was granted a waiver and was eligible to play immediately. Colby Leifson entered the transfer portal in October 2019, and as of the start of the season, no information was available regarding where he would transfer. On February 5, 2020, Utah Valley University announced Leifson would transfer to UVU with 3 seasons of eligibility remaining.\nIncoming Transfers.\nWith Mark Pope coming as the new head coach to BYU from Utah Valley University (UVU), three players from the UVU basketball team decided to follow Pope and transfer to BYU. First, on April 23, it was announced that Jake Toolson, the 2018-19 Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Player of the Year who had previously played for BYU for two seasons, would transfer back to BYU. During Toolson's second season at BYU, he applied for a medical leave of absence in December 2015. Therefore, while Toolson played two additional seasons at UVU, he still had one year of eligibility remaining, and as a graduate transfer, was eligible to play immediately during the 2019–20 season. Before Toolson recommitted to BYU, he was recruited by several schools including Duke, Virginia, Arizona State and Utah State. Jeff Goodman of WatchStadium.com ranked Toolson as one of the top 10 graduate transfers during the offseason. Then on April 24, Wyatt Lowell, a consensus 3-star prospect, announced he would transfer from UVU.

The next month, on May 8, Richard Harward also announced he would be transferring from UVU to BYU with two years of eligibility remaining. As of the start of the season, it had not yet been determined whether Harward would be eligible to play during the 2019–20 season. However, in December, Mark Pope indicated that Harward did not receive a waiver and would not be eligible to play during the 2019–20 season.\nOn May 6, Blaze Nield announced via social media that he would transfer from Utah State Eastern with three years of eligibility remaining.

Later in the summer, on July 31, it was reported that Alex Barcello, a consensus 4-star recruit, would transfer from the University of Arizona. He was granted a waiver and was eligible to play immediately.\nReturned Missionaries.\nTwo players were added to the roster during the offseason who recently returned from missionary service. Trevin Knell originally had committed to University of California, Berkeley. However, due to a coaching change at Cal, he decided to play for BYU in May 2017 before leaving on his mission in July. Knell is a consensus 3-star prospect who was part of the 2017 recruiting class. Cameron Pearson joins the team as a walk-on after serving a mission in Chile and utilizing a redshirt year. Pearson was part of the 2016 recruiting class after playing at Chatfield High School in Lakewood, Colorado.\n2020 Recruiting Class.\nSix high school players committed to play for BYU from the 2020 recruiting class. Richie Saunders, Dallin Hall, Tanner Hayhurst and Tanner Toolson each plan to complete two-year full-time missionary service before joining the team for the 2022–23 season. Only Townsend Tripple and Caleb Lohner will join the roster for the 2020–21 season. Tripple had originally planned to complete missionary service before joining the team and was assigned to Argentina, but decided to delay his mission trip due to coronavirus and joined the roster as a walk-on. In early June, it was reported that Caleb Lohner, a four-star forward from Texas who had previously signed with Utah, requested a release from his National Letter of Intent to sign with BYU. Lohner was released, and on June 26 officially signed with the Cougars. Lohner will be a true freshman and is immediately eligible to play.\nPreseason Polls and Rankings.\nBYU was selected to finish third in the West Coast Conference in the Preseason Men's Basketball Coaches Poll behind Gonzaga and Saint Mary's. Yoeli Childs and TJ Haws were named to the 2019-2020 All-WCC Pre-season Men's Basketball Team. For the second straight year, Yoeli Childs was among 20 college basketball forwards named to the Karl Malone watch list. The Karl Malone Award selects the nation's top power forward in NCAA college basketball.

Wooden Award.\nSeveral media outlets ranked BYU among the top 100 Division I college basketball preseason teams for the 2019–20 season. The rankings ranged from as high as #41 from Team Rankings and ESPN's BPI ranking to as low as #75 by Sports Illustrated. Some rankings projected BYU as a possible NCAA Tournament team or as a possible NIT Tournament selection. Consistent with the WCC preseason coaches poll, each of the writers projected BYU 3rd among WCC teams. A summary of the various preseason rankings that included BYU is as follows:\nPreseason Injuries and Suspensions.\nSeveral players were injured or were subject to suspensions during the offseason that will affect their ability to play during the regular season. Yoeli Childs was suspended by the NCAA for paperwork errors in the NBA draft exploration process that will cause him to miss the first nine games of the regular season. In August, Zac Seljaas broke his foot during a game in Italy and was estimated to be out until November or December 2019. His recovery progressed rapidly and he was cleared to play by the opening game of the season. Gavin Baxter injured his shoulder in a practice during September which will likely result in his missing the entire 2019–20 season. It was revealed in November that Jesse Wade has for some time had a knee injury which is likely to prevent him from playing for a long-term period.\nItaly Trip and Scrimmages.\nDuring August, BYU played four games as part of a trip to Italy. BYU won all four games during the 10-day tour of Italy. Every four years, the NCAA permits college basketball teams to take a trip to a foreign country. \nOn October 26, just before the regular season began, the team also played a scrimmage against the University of California, Berkeley. While the results and statistics of the scrimmage were not released to the public, Mark Pope indicated that the team played quite well.\nRoster.\nSource: BYU Basketball 2019-20 Roster (https://byucougars.com/roster/m-basketball/)\nMedia Coverage.\nRadio.\nGreg Wrubell and Mark Durrant return to call men's basketball for the 2019–20 season. Jason Shepherd will fill-in for Greg at Houston and vs. Montana Tech (football/women's soccer conflicts), and Terry Nashif will fill-in for Mark Durrant on select road games.\nTelevision.\nIn September 2019, the West Coast Conference (WCC) agreed to a multi-year deal through the 2026–27 season with ESPN and the CBS Sports Network to broadcast numerous basketball games each year. Previously, the WCC had an agreement with ESPN, but the new agreement adds additional television coverage of basketball games through the CBS Sports Network. Games broadcast on the CBS Sports Network are carried on channel 158 on the Dish Network, channel 221 on DirecTV and channel 269 on Xfinity. Under the terms of the deal, ESPN will broadcast 17 games during the regular season and the CBS Sports Network will broadcast a minimum of 9 games. ESPN will continue to broadcast the quarterfinals, semifinals and the championship game of the WCC tournament. BYU maintains the rights to broadcast home games on BYUtv (11.1 in Salt Lake City, Utah, channel 374 on the Dish Network, and channel 4369/9403 on DirecTV). Meanwhile, Stadium broadcasts will be simulcast on KJZZ or KMYU because Utah doesn't have a Stadium TV affiliate.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=11 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=11 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=11 style=| WCC regular season\n!colspan=11 style=| WCC tournament\nGame summaries.\nSeries Histories are adjusted this season to show the 47 wins the NCAA had BYU forfeit during the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons after BYU lost their appeal.

        "text": "The 1986–87 North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey team represented the University of North Dakota in college ice hockey. In its 9th year under head coach John Gasparini the team compiled a 40–8–0 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the eleventh time. The Fighting Sioux defeated defending champion Michigan State 5–3 to win the championship game at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan.\nSeason.\nEarly season.\nAfter a rather dismal season, North Dakota was expected to improve but not challenge for the WCHA title in 1987. The team, however, received a major boon from two players that changed their fortune. The first was from freshman goaltender Ed Belfour, a 21-year old player who had spent the past three years in relative obscurity in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League. The second was from returning sophomore Tony Hrkac who had produced well in his first campaign but spent the entire 1985-86 season with the Canadian National Team.\nThe two players were instrumental in Gino Gasparini's team getting off to a fast start, winning its first 8 games and jumping out to a huge lead in the conference standings. While Belfour was establishing himself in net as one of the top players in the country, Hrkac was on an all-time scoring pace, flanked by Bob Joyce and Steve Johnson. The Fighting Sioux split a pair of weekends on the road but they used their indomitable home crowd to their advantage and finished the month of November with a 14–2 record (13–2 in conference).\nDecember slump.\nNorth Dakota began December with another road split and followed that with their first home loss of the year, losing to a middling US International squad. Though they recovered slightly in the second game of the weekend the team lost both games of its holiday weekend in New England. Having lost four of their previous five games and producing some of their worst performances of the season, it appeared that the Fighting Sioux might be sliding back to the pack but a 4-game stretch at home came at the perfect time.\nWinning streak.\nUND hosted the two Boston schools at the beginning of January and took both games, dispelling any doubts about their ability to compete with Eastern teams, then welcomed in WCHA powerhouse Minnesota. The defense returned in force, holding the Gophers to two goals in each game and allowing Hrkac to lead the Sioux to consecutive wins and seat North Dakota atop the conference standings.\nThe Fighting Sioux continued their winning streak for another five weeks, taking 14 matches before their next loss which came on the final weekend of the regular season. UND finished with a record of 31–7 and won the WCHA handily, ending 7 points above Minnesota.\nWCHA tournament.\nAs the top seed, North Dakota would be able to play each round of the conference tournament at home. They faced Minnesota–Duluth in the quarters, easily dispatching the Bulldogs in both games. Next up was Colorado College who had upset in-state rival Denver. The Tigers fell 6–2 in the first game and the 4-goal advantage allowed the Fighting Sioux to get away with a sloppy effort in the rematch; CC won the second game but only by a single goal and North Dakota advanced to the championship with a 7–4 series win.\nNorth Dakota met Minnesota once more in the finals and again, despite possessing one of the top offenses in the country, couldn't get much past the Fighting Sioux defense. UND won both games by a 5–3 score and won the WCHA championship, their first in 7 years. The 36 wins they had at that point set a new program record while Tony Hrkac finished with 104 points, just 6 points away from a new NCAA record.\nNCAA tournament.\nNorth Dakota received the top western seed, and played another home series, this time against ECAC Hockey runner-Up St. Lawrence. UND won both games to take the total-goal series 9–4 with Hrkac piling up the points (2 goals and 5 assists), breaking Bill Watson's record for points in a season with two games yet to play. Additionally, the Fighting Sioux tied the NCAA record for wins in a season with 38 (Michigan State, 1985).\nUND met 1986 Runner-Up Harvard in the semifinal at the Joe Louis Arena. Once again Hrkac was the story of the game, scoring a goal and adding three assists as the Fighting Sioux trounced the Crimson 5–2 to reach the championship. On defending National Champion Michigan State stood in their way but just as they had against Harvard, UND got off to a quick start; this time with was Ian Kidd who led the way with a goal and two assists in the first period. North Dakota built a 3–0 lead after 20 minutes while allowed only 2 shots from the Spartans to reach Ed Belfour. MSU woke up in the second period, scoring twice on 8 shots, but the Sioux added another goal of their own as well as a fifth goal in the third to hold off Michigan State. The Spartans eventually scored their third of the game but it came too late to mount a comeback and North Dakota won their fifth national championship.\nAwards and honors.\nTony Hrkac scored 12 points in four tournament games, the second-highest total ever (behind the 13 points by both Aaron Broten (1981) and Tony Amonte (1990) as of 2019) and was awarded the tournament MOP despite scoring only once in the championship match. He was joined on the All-Tournament team by Ed Belfour, Ian Kidd and Bob Joyce. Just prior to the championship game Hrkac received the Hobey Baker Award as the top Division I athlete and finished the season as the first North Dakota player to lead the NCAA in scoring. Hrkac's 116 points in an NCAA record for a single season and is 7 better than the next-highest total (as of 2019). Head coach Gino Gasparini, for leading his team to the first-ever 40-win season, was awarded the Spencer Penrose Award as the top Division I coach, also a first for North Dakota. Hrkac, Joyce and Kidd were also named to the AHCA All-American West first-team, while Belfour was a second-team All-American.\nAll four players were also on the All-WCHA First Team with Hrkac being named as the conference Most Valuable Player and Gasparini as the Coach of the Year for the third time.\nBoth Ed Belfour and Tony Hrkac left the program after the season to begin their professional careers. Hrkac played a long time in the NHL, amassing 371 over 758 games while Belfour finished his career with the then-3rd-most wins in NHL history (484) and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The bronze measures approximately 22 x 6 x 15 ft, and rests on a granite base that measures approximately 16 x 8 x 15 ft. It was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's \"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\" program in 1993.\nThe monument was conceived in an effort to present Massachusetts as an artistic center. The chairman of the fundraising committee for the monument, Alexander H. Rice, declared in a speech from 1859:This statue shall exhibit the resources of our own State in the production of works of its class. The artist is a citizen of Boston; the statue will be modeled here; it will also be cast in bronze at some one of the foundries of Massachusetts, and it is expected that abundant funds for defraying its cost will flow from the generosity of our own people.Over the years, the statue's sword has repeatedly been broken and stolen; to avoid continually recasting a bronze replacement, caretakers installed a fiberglass substitute."

The Golf Estate (Variant) was revealed in September 2020, alongside a rugged \"Alltrack\" version with slightly raised suspension, body cladding, and all-wheel-drive.\nTechnology.\nThe Mk8 features several technological advancements, including standard LED headlights on all models and optional matrix LEDs, an advanced head-up display, a shift by wire system on models with the dual-clutch gearbox, Alexa integration, and an NFC mobile key with compatible Samsung smartphones via eSIM. The interior received a major overhaul, replacing the traditional analog instrument panel with an entirely digital 10.25\" driver's display and either an 8.25\" or 10\" center touchscreen for multimedia. Instead of physical buttons, a touch-sensitive panel houses controls for various functions, including the headlights and air conditioning/ventilation. The vehicle can also be upgraded with new functions after purchasing it, such as adaptive cruise control, WiFi hotspot, online-based voice control, Light Assist, navigation and Wireless App-Connect. The reliance on touchscreen controls in place of conventional physical buttons, knobs, or dials was criticised as being frustrating and unintuitive to use. \"Which?\" noted that \"too much attention must be diverted from the road to operate simple functions such as the climate control\" and called the layout \"a step backwards.\"\nAssistance systems.\nThe Mk8 includes a semi-autonomous driving system known as Travel Assist that can work at speeds of up to by using the adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist systems. Sensors in the steering wheel detect when the driver is touching it; if no input is detected for more than 15 seconds, the system will warn the driver before the emergency braking system automatically activates. It is also the first Volkswagen vehicle to use Car2X, where information can be exchanged with other cars and the traffic infrastructure within a radius of up to .\nGolf GTE.\nThe Golf GTE is a hot hatchback version with a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that produces . It has an all-electric range of about in EV mode, with a 13 kWh lithium ion battery supplementing the 1.4 litre TSI direct-injection petrol engine. The GTE, GTD, and GTI have different styling to distinguish them from less powerful Golf models. The front has a large honeycomb grille with a blue accent and an LED light strip positioned below, a black lower bumper trim, and an integrated background exterior light. The rear has a diffuser-style rear bumper. The roof spoiler is also different, with wider side sill panels, larger wheels, and red brake calipers. Inside, there are many minor differences, including sports seats with different interior fabrics and other minor changes.&lt;ref name=\"Motor1 GTD/GTE\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nGolf GTD.\nThe Golf GTD is a turbodiesel hot-hatchback version that is powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged direct-injection diesel engine (TDI) producing and . The engine uses two selective catalytic reduction filters with dual AdBlue injection. The manual transmission is not offered, with the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic being the only option. The suspension is shared with the GTI, having MacPherson struts up front and a multi-link system at the rear. 18-inch and 19-inch wheels are available. Plaid upholstery is standard like on the GTI, but grey highlights are used rather than red; the steering wheel also has touch-sensitive multi-function controls. An electronic shift lever is used in place of the patterned shift knob found on the GTI.\nGolf GTI.\nThe Golf GTI is a hot hatchback version that is powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged direct-injection petrol engine (TSI) producing and . The bodywork is nearly identical to the GTE, however the GTI is equipped with different wheels, badges, and red grille accents. The rear bumper has dual exit exhausts. Vehicle Dynamics Manager allows for more adjustability of the adaptive suspension dampers, while an Individual setting joins the other driving modes. The suspension is lowered by . Inside, plaid upholstery is standard, with additional red accents on the seats and steering wheel. 17-inch wheels are standard in Europe, with optional 18-inch and 19-inch wheels.\nGolf GTI 380.\nAnnounced by Volkswagen of America on August 30, 2023, the Golf GTI 380 is a special edition model for the 2024 North American model year. It is a commemorative model celebrating the Golf GTI's final production year with a manual transmission in North America. Future model years will only offer Volkswagen’s DSG transmission. \nGolf R.\nThe Golf R is powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged direct-injection petrol engine (TSI) producing and which is an increase of and when compared to the Mk7. It is offered with either the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic globally or the six-speed manual (US and Canadian markets only) in both the hatch and estate body styles. The R is lower than the standard Golf, and has a stiffer suspension incorporating an aluminium front subframe. The all-wheel-drive system has been updated and benefits from a torque-vectoring rear differential. Dynamic Chassis Control has also been updated to work with the Vehicle Dynamics Manager, allowing for a Drift Mode function. The exterior features quad exhaust tips and 19-inch wheels, while the interior is similar to the GTI, and has Nappa leather bucket seats as well as several R badges and an R-specific driver's display.\nGolf R 333.\nSet to debut on May 31, 2023, the limited edition Golf R 333 is meant to replace the 2022 Golf R \"20 Years Edition\".\nFacelift.\nVolkswagen CEO Thomas Schäfer announced the Golf is scheduled to go through a facelift at the beginning of 2024.\nPowertrain.\nAll internal combustion engines are turbocharged three- or four-cylinder units; engine options include petrol, mild-hybrid, plug-in hybrid, diesel and natural gas powertrains. The previous e-Golf model is no longer available, as it was replaced by the ID.3.\nTSI\nEuro 6d\nTSI models sold in compliant countries consist of a 1.0 litre turbocharged petrol engine (TSI) with or , and a 1.5 litre turbocharged petrol engine with or . All engines with an output up to 130 PS feature the efficient TSI Miller combustion process and a variable-geometry turbocharger, and the 1.5-litre engines have temporary Active Cylinder Management. A compressed natural gas (CNG) version of the 1.5-litre engine is also available as a TGI model.\nEuro 5\nTSI models sold in Euro 5 compliant countries, such as Australia, will at launch feature one option, a 1.4 litre turbocharged petrol engine (TSI) with . Unlike previous Golf's which featured a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox (DSG), this engine will be paired with a traditional 8-speed torque converter automatic. The transmission choice is due in part to the specific engine calibration (and automatic transmission combination) developed to meet Australia's outdated Euro 5 emissions regulations introduced in 2009, which are about a decade behind European standards.\neTSI\neTSI models use the same engines as the TSI models with the addition of a mild-hybrid system and a powerful brake energy recuperation function, paired exclusively with the 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox (DSG). The energy stored in the 48 V lithium-ion battery supplies the 12 V vehicle electrical system and drives the 48 V belt starter generator. The engines produce , or .\neHybrid\neHybrid models use a 1.4 litre turbocharged plug-in hybrid engine supplemented by a 13 kWh lithium ion battery, with a 6-speed DSG.

        "title": "2020 World Series",
        "text": "The 2020 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's 2020 season. The 116th World Series was a best-of-seven-playoff between the American League (AL) champion Tampa Bay Rays and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers defeated the Rays to win the series in six games for their first championship since 1988.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire series was played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, from October 20 to October 27 with the ballpark's seating capacity limited to 25 percent (11,500 fans). The pandemic resulted in the regular season being reduced to 60 games, and the postseason being held at neutral sites instead of at teams' home stadiums. Thus, it was the first World Series to be played at a neutral site, as well as the first since to be held at only one ballpark. Additionally, this was the first World Series since to be played entirely on artificial turf and the 5th all-artificial turf World Series. Further, it was the first ever World Series to be played entirely on second generation artificial turf. It was also the first World Series since to use the designated hitter for all games. With 2020 being the inaugural season for Globe Life Field, it became the first ballpark to host the World Series in its first year since Yankee Stadium in .\nDespite not playing on their home field, the Dodgers were still designated as having home-field advantage in the series with the better regular season record. Los Angeles and Tampa Bay alternated victories during the first four games of the series before the Dodgers won both Game 5 and 6, becoming the first designated home team to win the World Series since the 2013 edition. Los Angeles shortstop Corey Seager was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after batting 8-for-20 (.400) with two home runs, five runs batted in, and an on-base percentage of .556.\nBackground.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Major League Baseball (MLB) and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) agreed to shorten the standard 162-game season to 60 games, the shortest since 1878. They also agreed to hold an expanded 16-team playoff tournament for only the 2020 season. In addition to each league's three division winners, each league's three division runners-up qualified, and two additional wild card teams per league qualified based on win–loss record. The first round was the Wild Card Series, a best-of-three playoff hosted by the higher seeded team. After that, the postseason maintained its standard format of a best-of-five League Division Series, best-of-seven League Championship Series, and the best-of-seven World Series.\nAfter COVID-19 outbreaks among several teams resulted in the postponement of about 40 regular season games, MLB and the MLBPA agreed to hold the division series, league championships, and World Series in protective \"bubble\" environments at neutral sites to limit the chances of experiencing another outbreak. MLB chose Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, as the site of the 2020 World Series. The Texas Rangers, who play their home games at Globe Life Field, failed to qualify for the postseason. It was the first time since the 1944 World Series (played between the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns, who shared Sportsman's Park as their home field) that the entire series was held at one ballpark.\nWhile fans were not permitted to attend MLB games during the 2020 season, Commissioner Rob Manfred expressed his hope that fans would be able to attend the World Series in a limited capacity. On September 30, MLB announced that fans would be able to attend the NLCS and World Series at 25% capacity, allowing a maximum of 11,500 people to attend each game at Globe Life Field. Both teams stayed at the Four Seasons Resort and Club Dallas at Las Colinas as the designated bubble hotel.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nThe Tampa Bay Rays of the American League made their second appearance in the World Series in franchise history and their first since 2008. They finished the shortened regular season with a record, the best in the American League. They then swept the Toronto Blue Jays in two games in the Wild Card Series, defeated the New York Yankees in five games in the Division Series, and defeated the Houston Astros in seven games after leading 3–0 in the American League Championship Series (ALCS). Randy Arozarena hit seven home runs in 14 postseason games prior to the World Series, becoming the first rookie position player to ever win the ALCS Most Valuable Player Award. After his performance in the World Series, Arozarena would break records in home runs, hits, and total bases in a single postseason.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League made their 21st appearance in the World Series, passing the Giants for most all-time in the National League, and third in four years, having lost in 2017 and 2018. Prior to the 2020 season, the Dodgers traded outfielder Alex Verdugo and minor leaguers Connor Wong and Jeter Downs to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for outfielder Mookie Betts, starting pitcher David Price and cash considerations. The Dodgers finished the shortened regular season with a record, the best in all of MLB. Betts finished the 2020 60 game regular-season hitting .292/.366/.562 with 47 runs (fourth in the NL), 16 home runs (third), 39 RBIs, a .928 OPS, and 10 stolen bases.\nThe Dodgers swept both the Milwaukee Brewers in the Wild Card Series and the San Diego Padres in the Division Series, before defeating the Atlanta Braves in seven games in the National League Championship Series (NLCS) after trailing 3–1 in that series. In the NLCS, Betts made three straight series saving defensive gems in elimination games for the Dodgers as they were the fourteenth team in MLB history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit.\nSeries notes.\nThe 2020 season rule change, calling for each extra half-inning to begin with a runner on second base, was not implemented for any postseason round, including the World Series.\nThis was the fourth time in the Wild Card era when both teams with the best record in each league faced each other in the World Series. This had previously occurred in 1995, 1999, and 2013. Additionally, the Dodgers and Rays combined for a .692 winning percentage in the regular season, the highest combined regular-season winning percentage for a World Series matchup ever, surpassing the 1906 World Series between the Cubs and White Sox (.690).\nThis was the first World Series to feature two cities that held either the NBA or the NHL title the same year, as the Los Angeles Lakers won the 2020 NBA Finals on October 11 and the Tampa Bay Lightning won the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals on September 28. With the Tampa Bay Buccaneers qualifying and eventually winning Super Bowl LV the following winter, Tampa's NHL, MLB and NFL teams all made the championship round within a six-month span.\nThis was the first World Series since to have all games played on artificial turf.\nAndrew Friedman, the Dodgers President of Baseball Operations, was the Rays general manager from 2004 to 2014. Under Friedman's tenure as general manager the Rays saw their first run of success as a franchise, which was highlighted by a World Series appearance in 2008 and five 90-win seasons from 2008 to 2013. The 2020 Rays had only five players that were originally acquired by Freidman: Kevin Kiermaier (drafted in 2010) Blake Snell (drafted in 2011), José Alvarado (signed as an International amateur in 2012), Diego Castillo (signed as an International amateur in 2014), and Willy Adames (traded for in 2014). Only Alvarado was not on Tampa's World Series roster. Current Rays GM Erik Neander also received his start in baseball under Friedman in 2007 as an intern. Other connections between the two teams included Brandon Gomes, the current Dodgers Vice President &amp; Assistant General Manager, who was a Rays middle relief pitcher from 2011 to 2015; and Joel Peralta, the current Dodgers Special Assistant, Baseball Operations, who was a popular Rays reliever from 2011 to 2014. Dodgers relievers Adam Kolarek was also a member of the Rays from 2017 to 2019, while Dylan Floro pitched briefly for Tampa Bay in 2016.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nFor the pregame ceremony, Pentatonix performed the national anthem and four first responders threw out ceremonial first pitches.\nCody Bellinger hit a two-run home run off Tyler Glasnow in the fourth inning for the first runs of the series. Kevin Kiermaier reduced the Tampa Bay deficit to one run with a solo home run in the fifth inning. The Dodgers scored four runs in the fifth inning on a run batted in (RBI) fielder's choice by Max Muncy, followed by RBI singles by Will Smith, Chris Taylor, and Kiké Hernández. Glasnow finished with six runs allowed (all earned) in 4 innings on three hits and six walks, with eight strikeouts. Betts homered off Josh Fleming in the sixth inning. Muncy then doubled home Justin Turner for another run. Clayton Kershaw came out of the game after the sixth inning, having only allowed two hits (one of them the solo homer) and one walk while striking out eight. The Rays scored two runs in the seventh inning, when Mike Brosseau and Kiermaier singled in runs off reliever Victor González. The Dodgers held on to win 8–3.\nThe Dodgers tied several postseason records in Game 1. Kershaw's 11th postseason start tied Greg Maddux for second-most in MLB history, and he recorded his 200th postseason strikeout in the fifth inning, surpassing John Smoltz for second-most all time. The Dodgers as a team tied the New York Giants () for most stolen bases in a single World Series inning, with three.\nGame 2.\nFollowing Game 1, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts announced that Tony Gonsolin would start Game 2. Blake Snell started for the Rays. Brandon Lowe hit a solo homer off Gonsolin in the first inning to give the Rays their first lead of the series. Gonsolin allowed no other hits or runs and left after innings, the shortest start in the World Series since Jake Peavy in 2014. Joey Wendle doubled in two runs off Dustin May in the fourth inning to extend the Rays' lead to three. The teams traded two-run homers in the fifth inning, with Lowe hitting his second of the night, this time off May, and Chris Taylor, whose home run off Snell was the Dodgers' first hit of the game. Snell pitched innings and allowed two hits and four walks while striking out nine. A sacrifice fly by Wendle off Joe Kelly in the sixth added another run for the Rays and Will Smith homered off Nick Anderson in the bottom of the inning for the Dodgers. Corey Seager hit a home run in the eighth inning off Pete Fairbanks to close the gap to two, and set a new postseason record for most home runs by a shortstop (seven). The Rays held on to even the series with a 6–4 win. The Dodgers struck out 15 times in the game, tying the World Series franchise record set in the 18-inning third game of the 2018 World Series. Ji-man Choi became the first Korean-born player to record a hit in the World Series.\nGame 3.\nWalker Buehler started Game 3 for the Dodgers, and the Rays countered with Charlie Morton. Justin Turner hit a solo home run off Morton in the first inning for the first run of the game. In doing so, he tied Duke Snider for the most postseason home runs in Dodgers franchise history with 11. Max Muncy drove in two runs with a single in the third inning and the Dodgers set a new record for the most runs scored with two outs in a single postseason with 48. The Dodgers scored two more runs in the fourth inning on a safety squeeze by Austin Barnes and an RBI single by Mookie Betts. Morton was removed from the game after innings; he allowed five runs on seven hits and one walk while striking out six.\nA double by Willy Adames in the fifth inning gave the Rays their first run. Barnes hit a solo home run off John Curtiss in the sixth inning for the Dodgers, becoming the first player since Héctor López in 1961 to have both a squeeze bunt and a homer in the same World Series game. Buehler pitched six innings and allowed one run on three hits and one walk with 10 strikeouts, becoming the third-youngest pitcher with 10 or more strikeouts and three or fewer hits in a World Series game, behind only Ed Walsh in 1906 and Josh Beckett in 2003. Randy Arozarena hit a solo home run for Tampa Bay in the bottom of the ninth inning off Kenley Jansen, to give him a record-tying eight home runs and a record setting 23 hits in the postseason, but the Dodgers held on to win 6–2 to take a 2–1 lead in the series.\nGame 4.\nIn Game 4, Julio Urías started for Los Angeles and Ryan Yarbrough for Tampa Bay. For the second game in a row, Justin Turner hit a solo home run in the first inning. With that, he passed Duke Snider for most postseason home runs in franchise history and became the first player in MLB history to homer in the first inning of back-to-back World Series games. Corey Seager hit a solo home run in the third, for his eighth of the postseason, tying for the most all-time in a single postseason with Randy Arozarena, Barry Bonds, Carlos Beltrán, and Nelson Cruz. Yarbrough pitched innings with two runs allowed on five hits and one walk. Arozarena hit another home run leading off the bottom of the fourth inning, for his ninth of the postseason and sole possession of the record. Muncy hit an RBI single off Fairbanks to score Seager in the fifth inning. Hunter Renfroe hit a solo homer in the bottom of the inning to return the lead to one run. Urías pitched innings, allowing two runs on four hits and one walk with eight strikeouts. The Dodgers scored again in the sixth inning on an RBI single by Kiké Hernández against Diego Castillo. A three-run home run by Lowe, his third of the series, off Pedro Báez in the bottom of the inning gave the Rays their first lead of the game. Joc Pederson drove in two runs with a pinch hit single in the seventh inning off Nick Anderson to put the Dodgers back ahead. Kevin Kiermaier hit a solo homer in the bottom of the inning off Báez to tie the game. Seager, with his fourth hit of the game, drove in Chris Taylor on a single in the eighth against Anderson to put the Dodgers back up again.\nWith two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down in the count 1–2, Brett Phillips singled off Kenley Jansen for his first career postseason hit. As Kiermaier scored to tie the game, Taylor misfielded the ball in center field. As Arozarena rounded third base, he fell and began to head back to third base after getting back on his feet. With Muncy cutting off the throw from the outfield, his relay throw to Will Smith went off of Smith's mitt, allowing Arozarena to dive in safely at home to give the Rays an 8–7 win and tie the series at two. It was the first World Series game to end on an error since Game 6 of the 1986 World Series and Jansen was credited with his record fourth blown save in World Series appearances. Phillips also became the first player since Kirk Gibson in the 1988 World Series to get a game-winning hit with two out in the bottom of the ninth inning.\nGame 5.\nGame 5 featured a rematch of Game 1 starting pitchers; Clayton Kershaw for the Dodgers and Tyler Glasnow for the Rays. This was Kershaw's sixth World Series start, tying him for second most all-time in Dodgers franchise history behind Sandy Koufax and Carl Erskine. The Dodgers got the early lead again in this game, with Betts doubling to start the game and being driven in by a single by Seager, who advanced to second and third on wild pitches, and then scored on an infield hit by Cody Bellinger. Pederson hit a solo home run in the second to extend the Dodgers' lead to three. An RBI triple by Yandy Díaz drove in the Rays' first run in the third inning. Díaz then scored on a single by Arozarena, who collected his 27th hit, the most in a single postseason.\nIn the bottom of the fourth inning, Manuel Margot walked, stole second, and advanced to third on an error; he attempted to steal home with two outs, but was tagged out at the plate on a throw from Kershaw to catcher Austin Barnes. Charley Steiner, long-time Dodgers' radio announcer, pointed out that with the stands near the field mostly empty, Kershaw could hear his teammates in the dugout with the early warning.\nMuncy hit a solo homer in the fifth inning as the Dodgers set a new major league record for different players on the same team hitting a home run in a postseason series, with nine. Glasnow pitched five innings (the first Rays starter to do so in the series), allowing four runs on six hits and three walks with seven strikeouts. Kershaw's strikeout of Kiermaier in the bottom of the fifth inning moved him past Justin Verlander for the record of most career postseason strikeouts. He finished with innings pitched, two runs allowed on five hits, and two walks with six strikeouts. The bullpens held the game scoreless the rest of the way and the Dodgers won 4–2 to regain the series lead.\nGame 6.\nFacing elimination, the Rays started Blake Snell, who had a no decision in Game 2. The Dodgers countered with Tony Gonsolin, who allowed one run as an opener in Game 2 and took the loss. The Rays scored first with a solo home run by Randy Arozarena, his tenth during the postseason and third of the World Series, extending the record he broke back in Game 4. No other player had hit more than eight homers in a single postseason, and Arozarena was also the Rays' career postseason home run leader after just his first year with the team. Gonsolin faced 10 batters in his second start, lasting innings while allowing Arozarena's home run plus two hits and two walks. After Snell allowed a hit to Austin Barnes with one out in the bottom of the sixth inning, Rays manager Kevin Cash controversially decided to remove Snell from the game, who allowed only two hits throwing 73 pitches while striking out nine and walking none in innings. Cash brought in reliever Nick Anderson, who gave up a double to Mookie Betts before throwing a wild pitch with Corey Seager at bat that allowed Barnes to score the tying run. The Dodgers then took the lead on a fielder's choice grounder by Seager that scored Betts. The Dodgers added another run in the eighth inning when Betts hit a home run off Pete Fairbanks. Julio Urías pitched the last innings for the save, closing out the series by striking out Willy Adames looking, as the Dodgers won their seventh World Series championship and their first since 1988. This was the first World Series since 2013, where what was considered the \"home team\" won in what was considered \"home field.\"\nPostgame, Seager was presented with the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He was the eighth player—and the first since Madison Bumgarner in 2014—to be named MVP of both the World Series and League Championship Series in the same season. He batted .328 in the Dodgers' 18 postseason games. It was also announced that Justin Turner was removed in the eighth inning due to a positive COVID-19 test result. Despite tweeting that he was asymptomatic, Turner nevertheless took part in the celebration after the Dodgers had won the game, violating MLB protocols. He was the first player to test positive for the virus during the postseason bubble. The next day, Major League Baseball announced that Turner would be under investigation. On November 6, Turner apologized for the incident and received no punishment from Rob Manfred, who admitted that MLB could have handled the situation better.\nThe Dodgers were the first team since the 2010 San Francisco Giants to win a World Series with fully homegrown rotation starting every postseason game.\nWith the World Series win, the only team to beat the Dodgers in a series in 2020 was the Rockies, who won two out of three at Dodger Stadium in early September. With the best record in baseball, the Dodgers were also just the seventh team in the Wild Card Era (since 1995) to have at least a share of the best record in baseball and win the World Series, joining the 2018 Red Sox, '16 Cubs, '13 Red Sox, '09 Yankees, '07 Red Sox and '98 Yankees on that list. Because of an expanded 16-team postseason field, the Dodgers' 13 postseason wins were the most in MLB history. This would later be matched by the Texas Rangers in 2023.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nFor the 21st straight year, the World Series was televised in the United States by Fox. Joe Buck called the games as play-by-play announcer, along with John Smoltz as color analyst and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters. Kevin Burkhardt hosted the network's pregame and postgame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, David Ortiz, and Dontrelle Willis. Due to the pandemic, Fox's pregame and postgame shows all took place in their Los Angeles studios, as opposed to traveling on the road. Fox Deportes aired the series in Spanish, with Rolando Nichols, Edgar Gonzalez, Adrian Garcia Marquez, Carlos Alvarez, and Jaime Motta.\nMLB International fed the series to broadcasters outside the United States, with Matt Vasgersian providing play-by-play and Buck Martinez as color commentator.\nRatings.\nGame 1 was the least-watched World Series game ever, in terms of number of viewers, per Nielsen Media Research records dating back to 1968; it was also the first World Series game to draw less than 10 million viewers since Game 3 in , which underwent a 90-minute rain delay. Games 2 and 3 subsequently established new lows. and the average of 9.785 million viewers per game set a new World Series low.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio broadcast the series in the United States, with Dan Shulman on play-by-play, Chris Singleton and Jessica Mendoza as color analysts, Buster Olney as reporter, and Marc Kestecher hosting the pregame shows. Mendoza became the first woman to serve as a game analyst on a national World Series broadcast. Shulman, Singleton, and Mendoza called the games from ESPN's studios in Bristol, Connecticut due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe flagship radio stations for each team broadcast the games locally with their own announcers: WDAE (in English) and WGES (in Spanish) for Tampa Bay; and KLAC (in English), KTNQ (in Spanish), and KMPC (in Korean) for Los Angeles.\nAftermath.\nDodgers.\nMinutes after the final out, Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles City Hall, L.A. Live, the Santa Monica Pier and many other Los Angeles landmarks lit up blue to celebrate the Dodgers' World Series championship. Retired Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, the voice of the Dodgers from 1950 to 2016, congratulated his former team on Twitter and it was announced a few days later that Scully would narrate the team's year-end championship documentary. The 2020 championship was the final Dodgers' title Scully was able to witness until his death in August 2022.\nWith the Lakers having won the NBA Finals, Los Angeles repeated its achievement of having NBA and World Series champions in the same year, as both the Lakers and Dodgers had won in 1988. In fact, just 16 days had passed between the Lakers and Dodgers championship wins, which was the shortest timespan for two championships in the same city. 16 months later, the Los Angeles Rams would win Super Bowl LVI over the Cincinnati Bengals, and to follow it up 8 months after that the LAFC went on to win the 2022 MLS Cup in a penalty shootout by defeating the Philadelphia Union, meaning Los Angeles would be the first city to celebrate NBA, MLB, NFL, and MLS championships within a two-year span.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti advised fans not to gather for large celebrations. Nevertheless, many fans took to the streets of Los Angeles, lighting off fireworks and taking over street intersections, in areas such as Pico Boulevard, Broadway and Figueroa Street before being dispersed by police. The day after the World Series, the Dodgers released a statement regarding a public victory parade, stating any celebration would be postponed. In lieu of a rally, the Dodgers set up a drive-through holiday festival event. The event, which was held from November 27 through January 3, featured a light show, LED video displays, fake snow and interactive displays honoring the Dodgers World Championship and celebrating the holidays. When the Dodgers went to go face the Washington Nationals in July 2021, the team visited the White House and President Joe Biden to honor, and celebrate their World Series victory.\nLos Angeles would lose core members to their 2020 championship core over the next few seasons, losing Joc Pederson and Kiké Hernandez in free agency in 2020, Corey Seager and Kenley Jansen in free agency in 2021, Justin Turner in free agency in 2022, and non-tendering Cody Bellinger in 2022. Younger members of the team would also experience serious injuries, such as Walker Buehler, Tony Gonsolin, and Dustin May undergoing Tommy John surgery, and Gavin Lux losing a season due to a broken leg. Because of this, the Dodgers once vaulted depth would suffer. They would remain an excellent regular season team, but were upset each of the next three seasons in the playoffs. In postseason appearances in 2022 and 2023, they would hit under .200 as a team.\nRays.\nKevin Cash would receive tremendous backlash for his decision to remove Blake Snell after just 73 pitches in the sixth inning of Game 6. Cash defended his decision, stating he did not want Snell going through the Dodgers order a third time, even despite his dominance for innings. Yahoo Sports immediately named it one of the worst decisions in World Series history, while Deadspin called it the third worst in World Series history. FOX Sports post-game analyst and former big leaguer Alex Rodriguez said it was the worst decision he had ever seen in baseball. Upon his removal, opposing manager Dave Roberts said during postgame, \"Mookie looked at me with a little smile. We were all just excited that Snell was out of the game.\" Cash's decision sparked a discussion in whether modern managers were using too much sabermetrics and statistical analysis when making decisions rather than going with their instincts. Some noted that while the decision was controversial, the Rays offense had only scored one run and the Dodgers, who hit starters remarkably better the third time through the order, had not been shut out all season. Cash had also managed his starters with a short leash the whole season. In a similar move, Cash pulled Charlie Morton from Game 7 of the ALCS at 66 pitches, even though Morton only allowed 2 hits and no runs through for .\nFollowing their series loss, Tampa Bay placed Blake Snell on the trade block and later sent him to the San Diego Padres for a major-league catcher and three minor-league prospects. Veteran pitcher Charlie Morton signed with the Atlanta Braves as a free agent after his club option was declined. Morton would win a World Series with Atlanta the next season, which was the second of his career.\nA film based on Randy Arozarena's life is currently scheduled to be released between 2022 and 2023. Arozarena broke the record for home runs in a single postseason with ten, including three home runs in the World Series. Arozarena confirmed in 2023 the film had fallen through.\nDespite continuing their success in the regular season, having their first 100-win season in 2021 and making the postseason as a wild card in 2022 and 2023, the Rays have not won a postseason series since beating the Astros in the ALCS in 2020."

Thereafter cutters under contract to the Post Office Packet Service sailed weekly, and later twice-weekly, carrying mail between Weymouth, Dorset, and the Channel Islands. \"Royal Charlotte\" was the first to sail, on 13 February 1794. She and \"Rover\" were Dover packets on the Dover–Calais run displaced by the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Two packets were lost to the perils of the sea, and one a French privateer captured. \n\"Hinchinbrook\" was the first government packet to be wrecked. The loss of \"Hinchinbrook\", followed by the loss later that year of \"Francis Freeling\", left the Weymouth packet service short two vessels of the three on the route. Because the Post Office was expecting to introduce steam packets within a year or so it decide to make do with temporary solutions.\nThe Weymouth Packet Service borrowed \"Iris\", which had been a Milford packet but now was in reserve at Holyhead, and \"Dove\". It also employed a third. One account named the third as \"Samuel and Julia\". In a separate listing, the same author, named it as \"Queen Charlotte\".\nSteam service began on 7 July 1827 when \"Watersprite\" took out the first Channel mail to move by steam. \"Iris\" returned to Holyhead. Steam vessels replaced all the sailing vessels. \nIn 1827 the Admiralty took over the packets. The service ended in 1845.\nThe listing below has the packets in chronological order by time of service. The tonnages are all burthens (bm), with the first number coming from Lucking, and the second, if present, generally from Newport. \nNote: The Falmouth Post Office packet service also sailed vessels named \"Chesterfield\", \"Francis Freeling\", , and , but these sailed across the Atlantic and to the Mediterranean, and were more than twice the size of the Weymouth packets."

The Panthers played their home games at the GSU Sports Arena in Atlanta, Georgia as a member of the Sun Belt Conference. They finished the season 19–13, 12–8 in Sun Belt play to finish in a tie for fourth place. They were the No. 4 seed in the Sun Belt tournament, where they lost to Georgia Southern.\nPrevious season.\nThe Panthers finished the season 24–10, 13–5 in the Sun Belt, claiming the title of SBC regular season champions. The Panthers also went on to defeat Texas State and UT Arlington to become back-to-back champions of the Sun Belt tournament. As a result, they received the Sun Belt's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. As the No. 14 seed in the Midwest region, they lost to Houston in the first round.\nAfter losing in the NCAA tournament, it was reported that head coach Ron Hunter had been offered the head coaching position at Tulane, to which he responded that he was going to take 48 hours to think about the future. On March 24, Tulane officially announced Hunter as head coach. It was later reported Hunter opted to leave Georgia State due to a disagreement between the university and Hunter over contract details regarding performance bonuses, tying them to his team's GPA, which was purported by the university to be declining year after year. On 5 April 2019, Georgia State announced the selection of Rob Lanier, associate head coach for the Tennessee Vols, to head the program at GSU.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Sun Belt tournament"

He also played for Blackpool Borough and Swinton in England.\nPlaying career.\nRoberts made his first grade debut for South Sydney in round 10 of the 1986 against the Canberra Raiders at Seiffert Oval. At the end of the 1986 season, South Sydney finished in second place on the table. Roberts played in the club's major preliminary finals defeat against Canterbury-Bankstown. During the off seasons in Australia, Roberts played with Blackpool Borough in England between 1986 and 1987. \nRoberts was an integral part of the South Sydney team and in 1989 he played 21 games as the club won the minor premiership. Roberts played in South Sydney's preliminary final defeat against the Canberra Raiders at the Sydney Football Stadium.\nIn 1990, Roberts played no first grade games for Souths and only managed one appearance for the reserve grade team. This was mainly due to an off-field incident which happened in 1989 when Roberts was glassed in the eye during an altercation at a local pub. In 2013 Roberts recalled the incident saying “There were two guys, big fellas, laying into my cousin. So, you know, whaddya do?, I’ve gone running in to help but, as I did, one of them turned and glassed me. Drove it right into my face\". Roberts departed South Sydney at the end of the 1991 season after the club finished 14th on the table. Roberts made a total of 126 appearances for Souths across all grades.\nAfter leaving Souths, Roberts again played in England but this time for Swinton. Roberts left Swinton after only spending one season at the club."

He made his senior provincial debut in April 1980 for Western Province as a replacement against the touring South American Jaguars. Beck had a very successful 1982 season, when he was the top scorer in all provincial matches in South Africa with 225 points and in the Currie Cup with 149 points. As a result of his performance he was nominated for Player of the Year. Beck suffered a severe knee injury in 1983, which kept him out of rugby for more than a year. On his return in 1985 he struggled to regain his previous form and his last provincial match was on 18 May 1985 against Transvaal at Newlands.\nInternational career.\nBeck was first selected for the Springboks to tour New Zealand in 1981. He made his test debut for the Springboks as a replacement for Willie du Plessis at half time in the second test on 29 August 1981 at Athletic Park in Wellington. In the third test he once again replaced Du Plessis in the second half. His first start in a test for the Springboks was against the USA at the Owl Creek Polo ground in Glenville, New York. Beck scored one test try and also played in 9 tour matches for the Springboks, scoring 31 points (4 tries, 3 conversions, 2 penalty goals and 1 drop goal)."

        "text": "Mike Kelly (born 20 November 1967) is an American-Australian professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach of the South East Melbourne Phoenix of the National Basketball League (NBL). He spent the majority of his playing career in the NBL, where he won a championship with the South East Melbourne Magic in 1996 and was a two-time Best Defensive Player selection.\nProfessional career.\nKelly began his career at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California, during which he was part of a team with a 29–0 record that won the 1985 CIF Championship. He then moved to Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, and stayed there for two years.\nDuring his time at Orange Coast College he was recruited by Westmont College in the Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC), where he was a two-time All-GSAC player and helped Westmont win the 1988 NAIA District III Championship.\nFollowing his college career, Kelly spent one year in Taiwan playing for the Lucky Cement Basketball Team before moving to Australia. Upon arrival in Australia, Kelly spent time with the Griffith Demons (1990), the North East Melbourne Arrows (1991–1993) and the Nunawading Spectres (1994–1995). Kelly's debut in the NBL was as an injury replacement player for the Hobart Devils during the 1993-94 season, when he played 2 games and averaged 19.5 points per game. He again played 2 games the following season as a replacement player for the South East Melbourne Magic, before joining the Magic full time for the 1996-97 NBL season.\nDuring his full first season in the NBL, Kelly played major minutes and averaged 33 minutes and 5.2 rebounds per game. In this season he won the NBL Best Defensive Player Award and won a Championship with the Magic.\nKelly remained with the Magic for the 1997 NBL season, and was once again awarded the NBL Best Defensive Player Award. He also helped the Magic reach the Grand Final again, however they were beaten by the Melbourne Tigers 2–1.\nKelly moved to a brand new club for the 1998 season; the Victoria Titans. During his two year stay with the club, they reached the finals twice and the Grand Final once.\nFor the 2000–01 NBL season Kelly moved clubs again, this time to the Townsville Crocodiles. Fresh off a 22–6 record the previous year, the club repeated that record and reached the Grand Final, however lost in a tight contest with the Wollongong Hawks 2–1.\nAfter multiple successful years, the Crocodiles struggled in the 2001–02 season and the early part of the 2002–03 season, however a 16-game winning streak pushed the club into the finals. Despite their best efforts, they were pushed out of the finals by the Wollongong Hawks and the Sydney Kings.\nKelly joined the Wollongong Hawks for the 2004–05 NBL season, during which they reach the Grand Final. However, they were beaten 3–0 by the Sydney Kings.\nKelly remained with the Wollongong Hawks for the 2005–06 NBL season, however only played four games before retiring.\nCoaching career.\nAfter finishing his NBL career in 2005, Kelly continued his involvement with the Wollongong Hawks in the role of assistant coach for two seasons, before he returned to America in 2007 to coach a college team. Kelly joined a brand new coaching team at Vanguard University, however left in 2008 to join Utah Valley University.\nAfter an extended stint at Utah Valley, Kelly returned to the NBL to coach his former club the Townsville Crocodiles. He remained with the club for one season, but moved to Melbourne United for the 2015–16 NBL season due to the Crocodiles continued financial difficulties.\nKelly joined Melbourne United in 2015 as an associate head coach, and helped guide the club to the playoffs in 2016 and the championship in 2018.\nOn 14 April 2018, Kelly joined the Cairns Taipans as their head coach on a two season contract after the club sacked Aaron Fearne. Kelly won his first regular season game as head coach (88–70 vs Brisbane Bullets), however his team then went on a 14 game losing streak. The club finished the season with a 6–22 record and finished at the bottom of the ladder, with half the wins of the next team.\nIn his second year in Cairns, Kelly's team improved and nearly tripled their wins from the previous season to finish in third on the ladder with a 16–12 record, an achievement which shocked most people across the NBL. After winning the Coach of the Year award and announcing that he had resigned with the club on a two-year deal, the Taipans lost 2–1 in the semi-finals to the Perth Wildcats, who would later go on to win the championship.\nIn his third season with the club, the Taipans returned to the bottom of the ladder with a 8–28 record. On 31 March 2021, the Taipans announced that Kelly would not be returning to the club for the 2021–22 season.\nOn 26 July 2021, Kelly was announced as the associate head coach of the Perth Wildcats on a two-season contract.\nOn 30 March 2023, Kelly was appointed head coach of the South East Melbourne Phoenix."

        "text": "The 2019 FIA GT World Cup (formally the SJM Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup) was a Grand Touring (GT) sports car race held on the Guia Circuit in Macau on 17 November. It was the fifth edition of the FIA GT World Cup and the twelfth GT3 car race to be held in Macau. The event promoter, the Automobile General Association Macau-China, appointed the motorsports organiser Stéphane Ratel Organisation (SRO) to form a grid. The edition itself was made up of two races: a 12-lap qualifying race and an 18-lap main event.\nRaffaele Marciello of Mercedes-AMG Team GruppeM Racing won both the qualifying and main races from pole position. Marciello led every lap of both races to achieve Mercedes-Benz's third victory in the FIA GT World Cup since Maro Engel won in 2015 and Edoardo Mortara won in 2017. Second place went to Porsche driver Laurens Vanthoor of Rowe Racing, with his teammate Earl Bamber completing the podium in third.\nBackground and entry list.\nThe 2019 FIA GT World Cup was confirmed at the FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting on 6 December 2018, in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It was part of the 2019 Macau Grand Prix undercard. It took place on the Guia Circuit in the streets of Macau on 17 November 2019 after three days of practice and qualifying. It was the fifth FIA GT World Cup and the twelfth GT3 race in Macau since 2008. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), which oversaw motor racing, and the Stéphane Ratel Organisation jointly managed it. According to the event rules, the manufacturers' championship was presented to the manufacturer of the winning entrant's car.\nDrivers had to have competed in an FIA-regulated championship race based on GT3 regulations in the previous two seasons or have significant experience in Grand Touring (GT) cars to enter the race. The event was open to drivers with platinum or gold licences. Following lobbying by GT3 manufacturers and privateers, the FIA allowed amateur drivers (dubbed gentlemen drivers) to race in the 2019 event by reintroducing the silver rated category class for the first time since the 2016 edition. Only Bronze rated competitors could not race. Entries were open from 2 July to 31 August. The FIA released the entry list on 17 October. There were 17 drivers (11 factory drivers) representing 13 nationalities and four manufacturers: Audi, BMW, Mercedes-AMG, and Porsche. This was a two-driver increase from 2018, and it included all four previous FIA GT World Cup winners: Maro Engel, Augusto Farfus, Edoardo Mortara and Laurens Vanthoor.\nAn FIA investigation into Sophia Flörsch's accident at the 2018 Macau Grand Prix resulted in various track safety improvements. SAFER barriers were retrofitted at Lisboa and San Francisco Bend turns, and the barriers between Reservoir and San Francisco Bend corners were realigned. Hospital Bend turn's wall was moved back by and the photographers' bunker at Lisboa corner was dismantled.\nPractice and qualifying.\nThere were two half-an-hour practice sessions preceding the 18 November race. Earl Bamber's No. 98 Rowe Racing Porsche 911 GT3 R led the first practice session on the afternoon of November 14 before improving to a time of 2 minutes, 17.058 seconds on his final lap. His teammate Laurens Vanthoor was second-quickest, followed by Mercedes-AMG Team GruppeM Racing's Engel and Raffaele Marciello and Craft-Bamboo Racing's Mortara in positions third through fifth. Mortara had been faster late in practice, but he overshot the Lisboa corner entry and made slight contact with the outside barrier. Engel also went off the circuit but continued. Bamber lapped fastest at 2 minutes, 17.360 seconds in the second practice session on the afternoon of 15 November. His teammate Laurens Vanthoor was second, with Kelvin van der Linde of Audi Sport Team Rutronik, Phoenix Racing's Christopher Haase, and Marciello were third to fifth. Weian Chen caused the first of two stoppages when he ran onto some oil and struck the Reservoir Bend turn barrier. Soon after, Engel stopped his car with apparent mechanical trouble. The session resumed once both cars were removed. A high-speed collision for Absolute Racing's Kevin Estre at Mandarin Oriental Bend corner barrier caused a second stoppage.\nFriday afternoon's half-hour qualifying session determined the qualification race's starting order with each driver's fastest lap times. The setting sun resulted in lower track temperatures. Marciello, the 2018 Blancpain GT Series champion, set a lap time of 2 minutes, 15.699 seconds in the No. 999 GruppeM Racing Mercedes-AMG GT3 at the session's end to achieve his second consecutive pole position for the qualifying race. He demoted the highest-placed Audi driver Dries Vanthoor for Audi Sport Team WRT to second after lacking pace in practice. Rowe's Bamber and Laurens Vanthoor were not as quick as they had been in practice, qualifying, third and fourth, separated by two-tenths of a second. Engel was third before falling to fifth late on, being joined by his teammate Mortara in sixth. Audi drivers occupied seventh and eighth with Haase (who was fastest early on but sustained a puncture later on) ahead of Van Der Linde. Alexandre Imperatori and Charles Weerts of Team WRT took ninth and tenth. FIST-AAI Team's Joel Eriksson was the highest-placed BMW driver in 11th, ahead of his brandmate Farfus in 12th. Craft-Bamboo Racing's Alessio Picariello qualified 13th with Estre 14th, Solite Indigo Racing's Roelof Bruins in 15th, Zun Motorsport Crew's Adderly Fong 16th and Chen completing the starting order in 17th. Separate accidents involving Fong and Chen caused stoppages to qualifying.\nQualifying race.\nThe 12-lap qualifying race to set the main race's starting order was scheduled to start in an air temperature of at 13:05 Macau Standard Time () on 16 November, but was delayed for half an hour due to race management noticing a technical issue with the starting lights gantry. Picariello was forced off the grid and into the pit lane after his car would not start during the formation lap. There, he started after some quick troubleshooting. Dries Vanthoor attempted to overtake pole-position starter Marciello at the start by slipstreaming him, but instead he crashed into the outside wall of the Mandarin Bend corner with the rear of his car. Dries Vanthoor stopped at the entry to Lisboa turn due to car bodywork damage and a left-rear puncture. Further round the lap, Chen lost control of his car and stopped briefly before continuing. At the conclusion of the first lap, the safety car was used for the first time to move Dries Vanthoor's car to a safe area. Racing resumed on lap four and Maricello began to pull away from Rowe teammates Bamber and Laurens Vanthoor who were close behind one another in second and third.\nEngel attempted to pass van der Linde for fifth on the outside at the braking zone for Lisboa turn on lap five, but made minor contact with the latter's car's rear. As he drove onto the rumble strips, Engel lost control of his vehicle, slammed into the inside guardrail, and struck Mortara in the side. Both Engel and Mortara retired with car damaged and the safety car was deployed again so that the cars could be extricated. Van Der Linde was able to enter the pit lane to retire with car damage. The incident promoted Haase and Farfus to fourth and fifth. Five laps remained when racing resumed, with Marciello again leading Bamber in second. Farfus overtook Haase for fourth into Lisboa turn on the eighth lap, as the top three pulled away from the rest of the field. In the final laps, Bamber and Laurens Vanthoor appeared to be quicker in the track's tighter sections but could not match Marciello's overall pace. Maricello thus led for the remainder of the event, claiming victory and pole position for the main race. Bamber was 0.866 seconds behind in second, with teammate Laurens Vanthoor in third. Farfus finished fourth after starting 12th, and Haase finished fifth. Imperatori, Weerts, and Estre finished sixth through eighth. Eriksson, ninth, had anti-lock braking system issues, causing him to frequently lock his tyres and brake early for corners. Fong, Bruins and Picariello were the final finishers.\nMain race.\nAt 12:25 p.m. local time on November 17, the 18-lap main race began in dry weather of . Due to the collision with Mortara in the qualifying event, Engel was penalised with a pit lane start. Laurens Vanthoor got off to a faster start than Bamber, passing his teammate for second place as Maricello maintained the lead. The leading trio pulled away from the field, as Bamber held off Farfus in the first lap. Estre attempted to pass Imperatori on the inside into Lisboa corner on the second lap, but collided with the side of his teammate's car. Imperatori was sent into the Lisboa tyre barrier and retired from the race shortly after. On lap three, Dries Vanthoor passed Weerts for tenth. Estre lost control of his car on the inside of the kerb through the quick Mandarin Oriental Bend corner two laps later. In an incident similar to Dries Vanthoor's the day before, he made high-speed contact with the guardrail wall at the turn's exit. A wheel from Estre's car detached and rolled across the track, but no other driver hit it, and debris from his car littered the track. Estre pulled over to the side of the track, and the safety car was dispatched to move the Porsche off the track.\nFollowing the removal of Estre's car from the track, racing resumed at the conclusion of lap eight. Farfus made a quick restart and used his faster straightline speed to briefly pass Bamber's slower starting car for third into the Mandarin Oriental Bend turn. Bamber was able to reclaim third on the inside entering Lisboa corner when Farfus had to slow for Laurens Vanthoor, who made slight contact with the rear of Marciello's car. On lap 10, van der Linde passed Bruins for tenth. With a gap of more than a second on lap 13 due to Maricello's personal best sector times, Vanthoor let his teammate Bamber take second, allowing Bamber to close in on Marciello. Bamber was six-tenths of a second faster than Maricello and close behind him. On the 15th lap, Bamber made slight contact with the barrier after running wide at the Police Bend corner and lost his left exterior wing mirror.\nWhen Marciello was cautious entering the Melco hairpin, Bamber closed in on him again, making slight contact with the rear of his vehicle on the final lap. Marciello led all of the racing laps over the weekend in only his third FIA GT World Cup start, achieving Mercedes' third victory in the event, following Engel in 2015 and Mortara in 2017. In accordance with a pre-race agreement, Bamber purposefully slowed through the R Bend corner and the start/finish straight, giving his teammate second as Bamber finished third. Farfus finished fourth, leading the close group of Haase, Mortara, Eriksson, Dries Vanthoor, Engel and Van Der Linde in positions five through ten. The final classified finishers were Bruins, Weerts and Weian with Fong and Picariello the two other retirements.\nThe sixth running of the FIA GT World Cup was scheduled for 2020, but the FIA cancelled it due to the COVID-19 pandemic and replaced it with the Macau GT Cup, which was only open to racers from local racing series."

        "title": "1985–86 Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1985–86 Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey team represented Michigan State University in college ice hockey. In its 7th year under head coach Ron Mason the team compiled a 34–9–2 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the eighth time in its history. The Spartans defeated Harvard 6–5 in the championship game at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\nSeason.\nMichigan State entered the 1985–86 season looking for a bit of redemption. After winning the previous four conference tournament titles, but failing to make it past the national quarterfinals three times, Ron Mason was beginning to be pegged as a great coach who couldn't get his team over the hump. Though Michigan State lost its top three scorers from the year before they did return the goaltending tandem of Bob Essensa and Norm Foster who had helped the Spartans set a new NCAA record with 38 wins. With so few seniors on the squad, the captaincy went to junior defenseman Don McSween. While the roster was a little light on four-year players, Michigan State did bring in one of the most highly touted prospects in Joe Murphy along with 7 other freshmen who would see significant ice time with the Spartans.\nEarly season struggles.\nMSU got off to a good start with a pair of road wins over Ohio State before splitting a home-and-home with a surging Western Michigan squad. After three wins and a tie against lesser programs, the Spartans took on arch-rival Michigan and split another home-and-home series. After a week of exhibition matches against the Canadian National Team MSU again split a weekend series and while their home record was stellar they had dropped to 3–3 on the road. That mark wasn't improved when they split another road series against the normally hapless Illinois–Chicago and then dropped both road games against a good Lake Superior State team. The Spartans were able to recover a bit in the conference standings with a pair of home wins against the Buckeyes and lift their record to 11–6–1 before losing in their first non-conference game of the year to the former CCHA team Northern Michigan, their only home loss of the season.\nGreat Lakes Invitational.\nMichigan State entered the Great Lakes Invitational having won the previous 3 years but the team was in need of a shock to the system to shake it out of its doldrums. They got just that when they were pushed to the limit in the semifinal by WCHA bottom-feeder Michigan Tech, escaping with a 2–1 win in overtime. The next night it was almost as if a different team hit the ice when the Spartans cruised to an 8–3 win in the championship over defending national champions Rensselaer. Don McSween was named MVP of the tournament.\nCharging up the standings.\nMichigan State had a good deal of ground to make up in the second half of their season and the kicked it off with a sweep of Western Michigan and Miami they were slowed down by Ferris State and Michigan who provided MSU with a tie and loss respectively, but the Spartans were buoyed by playing 7 of their final 8 games at home and they took every game to finish the season at 23–7–2 in CCHA play, one win ahead of both Western Michigan and Bowling Green. The biggest standout for the year was former walk-on Mike Donnelly who had amassed a huge number of goals and was beginning to draw attention from NHL scouts.\nCCHA tournament.\nThe Spartans entered the CCHA tournament against Michigan and while the Wolverines had beaten MSU twice both had been in the Wolverine's arena and with Michigan State playing host the Spartans were able to drop Michigan in both games to take the quarterfinal series. Michigan State headed down the road to Detroit for the championship rounds, and faced stiff competition from lake Superior State but the Spartans edged out the Lakers 3–2 in overtime. In the championship game the following night MSU's offense, which finished second-best in the nation, failed them and they could only manage a single goal against Western Michigan's Bill Horn, ending their 4-year reign as CCHA tournament champion.\nNCAA tournament.\nFortunately, the Spartans had played well enough over the course of the season to earn an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. They had played so well, in fact, that they were seeded ahead of Western Michigan and would play at home in the quarterfinal round. MSU used the massive home advantage they had to beat Boston College in both games and advance to the Frozen Four. In the semifinal MSU was met by perennial power Minnesota who had upset the top eastern seed Boston University in the quarters. Both teams were built around scoring and that fact shone through the game; Michigan State won the match 6–4 with Norm Foster turning aside 42 shots.\nWith the win Michigan State made its first championship game in 20 years and only had Harvard left to stop them. Before the game had even started, however, MSU gained an advantage over the Crimson; Hobey Baker Award winner Scott Fusco had injured his knee in the other semifinal and couldn't play in the final. Despite missing their best player, Harvard got off to a fast start gaining a 2–0 lead by the 8-minute mark. MSU cut the lead in half at the end of the first but Allen Bourbeau scored his second goal of the night to give the Crimson their 2-goal lead back. Harvard's third goal was scored on just their seventh shot of the night and it looked as if the Spartans were outclassed. Not to be deterred, however, Jeff Parker cut the lead back to one with Bourbeau's third of the night coming 10 minutes later. Mike Donnelly scored his 58th goal of the season just before the end of the second to give MSU a fighting change in the final period.\nSure enough MSU's offense came through when needed and two freshman found the back of the net before the three-minute mark to give the Spartans their first lead of the night. Harvard responded with the tying goal four minutes later and the two teams fought furiously to regain the lead. with just under three minutes to play Donnelly scored his second of the game to give MSU the lead and the Spartans held on to win the national championship.\nAwards and honors.\nMike Donnelly was awarded the Tournament MOP and was joined by Norm Foster, Don McSween and Jeff Parker on the All-Tournament Team. Donnelly was also named to the AHCA All-American West First Team while McSween was named to the Second Team. Donnelly and McSween both made it onto the All-CCHA First Team while Bob Essensa made the Second team. Joe Murphy was awarded the CCHA Rookie of the Year and would become the first college player to be take first overall in the NHL Entry Draft. Murphy was joined by 12 of his teammates from the 1985–86 Spartans, an astounding number of NHL players for a college team.\nMike Donnelly's 59 goals was the highest total scored since the NCAA created Division I in 1973. Only Phil Latreille has scored more in a season, doing so in the early 1960s, before there were any divisions in college ice hockey.\nRick Tosto became the first player in NCAA history to win national titles with two separate teams. After winning with Renssealer in 1985 he transferred closer to his home of Dearborn Heights, Michigan and won with the Spartans.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#007A53\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#007A53\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#007A53\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#007A53\" | "

        "title": "Middlebury Panthers men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Middlebury Panthers men's ice hockey team represents Middlebury College in men’s hockey and has done so since 1922 (with the exception of a few years during World War II). The Panthers currently play at the Division III and have won the most championships (8) of any D-III program. For a time the team did play along with top-level programs but when men's ice hockey divided into separate tiers in the mid-1960s Middlebury left the upper echelon.\nHistory.\nMiddlebury played as an Independent program, as all schools did officially, prior to 1950 but the Panthers were a founding member of the NCAA's first ice hockey conference, the Tri-State League. The Panthers remained in the conference for nine years but through most of that time they were pushed around by the national powers Clarkson, Rensselaer and St. Lawrence. Towards the end of their tenure in the conference, however, Middlebury did land a recruit who would rewrite the NCAA record book.\nPhil Latreille joined the Panthers in 1957 and began playing immediately. Normally, freshmen did not play for varsity squads as the NCAA only allowed players eligibility for three seasons. However, because Middlebury wasn't in contention for the national tournament, they could ignore that NCAA regulation. Latreille scored 36 goals in only 20 games in his first year then set a new single-season record with 57 goals as a sophomore. For his third season, Latreille shattered his record with 77 goals and capped that off with a senior season of 80 goals and 108 points. No other player in NCAA history has even scored 60 goals in a season. Latreille held the points record for 24 years before being surpassed by Bill Watson, who played in more than twice as many games in his record-breaking campaign. Latreille still holds the NCAA record for career goals at 250 with second a distant 94 goals behind (Chuck Delich). Latreille's scoring exploits were so spectacular that he was able to parley them into a brief appearance with the New York Rangers after graduating. While he didn't stick in the National Hockey League, Latreille remains Middlebury's only alumnus to play in the NHL.\nAfter Latreille left, Middlebury became one of the 28 founding members of ECAC Hockey, remaining with the conference for three seasons. By the end of the 1963–64 season it was obvious that ECAC Hockey had to make a change and the conference divided itself into upper- and lower-tiers. This was the first formal delineation of men's ice hockey and Middlebury was one of the 14 teams that founded ECAC 2. The Panthers played well under Wendall Forbes and typically finished in the top half of the conference. In 1971 Middlebury was again a founding member of a conference, this time for the NESCAC, though because the new conference didn't sponsor ice hockey as a varsity sport the Panthers remained with ECAC 2.\nBy the mid-1970s ECAC 2 had become just as ungainly as ECAC Hockey had been, boasting 31 programs by 1977. Rather than split into separate conferences, ECAC 2 divided itself into East and West Divisions with both playing separate postseason tournaments. Middlebury won its first conference tournament in 1979 but because NESCAC rules prohibited them from participating in any national tournament the Panthers didn't receive an invitation to the 1979 Championship.\nWhen the NCAA instituted numerical classifications in 1973, Middlebury became a Division III school but the ice hockey program played at the Division II level. This continued for a decade until the NCAA instituted a Division III Championship and, while the Panthers could not participate in the tournament, most of their contemporaries were able to play in the championship. As a result, almost the entire D-II level dropped down to the lower tier with Middlebury going along. During the change came a formal split for ECAC 2 with Middlebury founding yet another ice hockey conference, this one called ECAC East.\nIn the mid-'80s Forbes stepped down and was replaced by Bill Beaney. It took Beaney a short time to rebuild the program and five years after he took over the Panthers won both the conference regular season and tournament titles. In 1994 the NESCAC changed its rules to permit its member teams to play in one postseason tournament, either conference or national, and a year later Middlebury made its first appearance in the Division III championship. Middlebury jumped in with both feet and won each of their games, including the championship over #1-ranked Fredonia State to capture the school's first national title in any sport. Beaney kept the panthers at the top of Division III and won five consecutive national championships (1995–1999), setting an NCAA record for any level of play.\nMiddlebury's championship streak ended in 2000, the same year that the NESCAC began to sponsor ice hockey as a sport and Middlebury joined 8 other schools to form the new conference. The NESCAC also allowed their member schools to play in both the conference and national tournaments beginning in 2000. This allowed the Panthers to play in their first conference tournament in 5 years and win their first of three consecutive titles. Beaney took a sabbatical in 2003 but returned the year after to lead Middlebury to three consecutive titles for a total of 8. The team was in contention for a ninth championship in 2007 but fell to Oswego State in overtime. The program slowly declined after its first championship loss and, after Beaney retired in 2015, the team has yet to post a winning season.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nThis is a partial list of Middlebury's record. It covers the time from when Middlebury restarted the ice hockey program after World War II until the program officially left the top tier of men's ice hockey.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Middlebury alumni were a part of an Olympic team."

        "text": "The 2021 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships were held in Kitakyushu, Japan from October 18–24, 2021. The competition took place at the Kitakyushu City General Gymnasium. It was the third time that Japan hosted the event, following the 1995 and 2011 editions.\nThe competition was originally scheduled to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark, before the Danish Gymnastics Federation withdrew from hosting in July 2020. In November 2020, the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique announced Kitakyushu as the replacement host city for the same dates.\nAlthough the World Championships are traditionally not held in Olympic years, the postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics caused the 2021 event to fall during the same year. The last time the Olympics and the World Championships were held in the same year was in 1996.\nMen's results.\nIndividual all-around.\nChina's Zhang Boheng narrowly defeated reigning Olympic champion Daiki Hashimoto of Japan by 0.017 points to take the title. Both won their first individual World medals. Ukrainian gymnast Illia Kovtun rounded out the podium in bronze.\nBoth Zhang and Hashimoto later withdrew from the first day of event finals.\nFloor.\nNicola Bartolini of Italy won the country's first-ever gold medal on floor, as well as its first World title since Juri Chechi's 1997 win on rings. Silver medalist Kazuki Minami of Japan and bronze medalist Emil Soravuo of Finland also won their first individual World medals. Defending champion Carlos Yulo of the Philippines had a costly out-of-bounds deduction and finished fifth.\nPommel horse.\nStephen Nedoroscik won the United States' first title on pommel horse and the country's first men's title in any event since Danell Leyva won parallel bars in 2011. China's Weng Hao and Kazuma Kaya of Japan tied for the silver medal.\nRings.\nTop qualifier Lan Xingyu of China won his first individual World title after previously earning gold as an alternate for the Chinese team in 2018. Marco Lodadio of Italy was called up from first reserve and earned a second consecutive silver on the event, his third World medal overall. Lodadio's teammate Salvatore Maresca and Grigorii Klimentev of RGF tied for the bronze medal, the first individual World medal for both.\nWomen's results.\nIndividual all-around.\nAngelina Melnikova (RGF) became the first non-American to win a World or Olympic all-around title since her Russian teammate Aliya Mustafina did so at the 2010 World Championships. Americans Leanne Wong and Kayla DiCello won the silver and bronze medals, respectively, the first individual World medal for both.\nVault.\nReigning Olympic champion Rebeca Andrade of Brazil won the title for her first individual World medal. Silver medalist Asia D'Amato is the first Italian female artistic gymnast to ever qualify for a World vault final. Angelina Melnikova (RGF)'s bronze was her second individual medal at the World Championships following the all-around title.\nUneven bars.\nWei Xiaoyuan won the title for her first individual World medal and China's first medal on the event since winning four titles in a row from 2013 to 2017 (tie in 2015). Top qualifier Rebeca Andrade of Brazil earned the silver for her second individual medal of the day. Wei's teammate Luo Rui finished in bronze after losing a tiebreaker to Andrade.\nQualification.\nMen's results.\nSubdivision 6 of the men's qualification was delayed 90 minutes while the equipment was disinfected after a Colombian gymnast, later revealed to be Jossimar Calvo, in the previous subdivision tested positive for COVID-19. Calvo subsequently withdrew from the all-around final."

Having trained dozens of first-class and international cricketers, she received the Dronacharya Award in 2005.\nEarly life and playing career.\nA sports fan from childhood, Sharma played kho kho at the national level before gradually developing interest in cricket. Having lost her father at age four, it was her mother who advised her to take up the relatively more popular sport of cricket so that she could make a career out of it. Sharma soon rose up the ranks as a medium pace bowler and was selected in the national team. She claims that despite being part of the playing eleven of a Test match against Australia in 1975 she was left out on the morning of the match.\nCoaching career.\nNoticing her lack of interest in academics, Sharma's mother enrolled her into a cricket coaching programme in Janki Devi Memorial College in Delhi. In 1976, she became the first woman to receive a coaching diploma from the National Institute of Sports in Patiala. According to Sharma, people were reluctant to send their children to her as they preferred male coaches but \"people found out that I am equally capable as compared to my male colleagues\" after one year. She credited the media who used to \"write about me and appreciate my work. All that gave me enough strength to carry on initially.\"\nOver the years, Sharma coached dozens of men and women cricketers who went on to play at international and first-class level. She is reportedly India's first woman cricket coach. Some of her women trainees who played at the international level are Manimala Singhal, Shashi Gupta, Anju Jain, and Anjum Chopra. Between 1975 and 1990, Sharma also conducted coaching camps for international cricketers where the likes of Shantha Rangaswamy, Diana Edulji, Gargi Banerji, Sandhya Agarwal and Shubhangi Kulkarni underwent training. She was the coach of Deep Dasgupta, who played for the men's national team, since he was seven years of age. Since the early-1980s, she trained Indian team probables at Sports Authority of India's National Stadium Cricket Academy in Delhi. She later worked as a coach and manager of the women's national team. She briefly worked on the national women's team selection committee until 2015 when the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) removed her because she had not played international cricket.\nIn July 2002, the Women's Cricket Association of India (WCAI) recommended her for the Dronacharya Award. She received the award in 2005."

        "title": "1928 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": " The 1928 Auckland Rugby League season was its 19th. Devonport United won the Senior A Championship for the first time under the Devonport United name, though they had won it twice before as North Shore Albions, before the North Shore merger with Sunnyside. Marist \nOld Boys won the Roope Rooster trophy for the first time. This was their second major trophy after winning the championship in 1924. They also went on to defeat Devonport to win the Stormont Shield.\nEllerslie United finished last in the first grade championship and as a result had to play a promotion relegation match with the winners of the B Division which was Grafton Athletic. This was the second consecutive year they had met in this match. Ellerslie won 15-13 to retain their place in the first grade. The Grafton club then decided to amalgamate with Kingsland Rovers who were also in the B Division to gain acceptance into the 1st grade competition for the 1929 season.\n \n \nSeason news and summary.\nSenior competition.\nThe senior club season featured over 110 matches through various competitions and did not finish until late October when suburban cricket competitions had already begun.\nGrafton Athletic won the Senior B Division competition going undefeated season after they had been relegated the previous season, though they were beaten in the promotion relegation match with Ellerslie meaning they would have to stay there for another season. Point Chevalier defeated Grafton Athletic in the Stallard Cup final which was the Senior B knockout competition. The season was notable for the number of teams which played sides from other areas. Ponsonby, Richmond, Parnell, and the Northcote and Birkenhead Ramblers all played sides from north Auckland and the Waikato. During the year Carlaw Park saw its 300th senior grade match played on it stretching back to its opening in 1921 while the senior competitions also saw its 1000th game played (includes all official 1st grade matches and matches involving senior teams in the B Division).\nMt Albert Club formed.\nMt Albert held their first meeting at St George's Hall in Mt Albert on the evening of 3 April. Ralph Wilson chaired the meeting and George Rhodes, chairman of the Auckland Rugby League was present. It was decided that they would form a club in the Mt Albert area though they did not decide on a name at this time. They would enter teams in the third and fourth grades. During the season Auckland Rugby League made a grant of £3 to Mount Albert for a dressing shed.\nNewmarket Club formed.\nIn April it was reported that Newmarket was entering a team in the 6th grade competition. They club was to wear yellow and black. There was a fear that the club would rob the Parnell club of players but the league accepted the nomination anyway. The also then entered sides in the third grade intermediate grade as well as another team in the sixth grade in the B section. They also had a Primary School side which won the schoolboy championship.\nRepresentative program.\nIt was a very busy season, with ten representative fixtures including matches against the touring England team. Ernie Asher, Edwin Vincent Fox, and Bert Avery were appointed selectors for the representative team for the season.\nAnnual general meeting.\nAt the annual general meeting of Auckland Rugby League it was noted that out of the 28 playing days during the 1927 season thirteen of them were played in wet weather; however, crowds were still good and they were happy with the growth of the game. Further developments at Carlaw Park were planned, consisting of \"conveniences for ladies…extra accommodation… for players, and three more dressing rooms\" at a cost of £60. There was a lengthy discussion about Ellerslie's application to join the A Grade. They had won the B Grade competition and defeated the last placed Grafton from A Grade. The annual general meeting was held at the Auckland Chamber of Commerce on Swanson Street.\nThistle Cup.\nThe Management Committee announced at the midway mark of the senior club season that the Thistle Cup would be awarded to the A or B grade team that had scored the most points in the second round of competition. If two teams were tied then the trophy would be awarded to the team which had scored the most points for the whole season.\nGround availability.\nAn ongoing issue for many clubs in Auckland was the availability of playing fields as the number of teams grew. During the season Northcote opened a new field at Stafford Park which is still in existence adjacent to State Highway 1 just north of the Auckland Harbour Bridge. Devonport also had a deputation present at the Devonport Borough Council meeting on 10 May to ask about the shortage of grounds in the area. The club asked for permission to use some of the spare cricket grounds for matches. Mayor E. Aldridge said there would be a ground available at Stanley Bay.\nRule changes.\nAfter Round 5 the issue of time keeping in matches at Carlaw Park was raised at the weekly Management Committee meeting. The bell had been rung in the match between Richmond and Devonport at Carlaw Park before the ball was dead which was against previously arranged rules. Agreement could not be reached on whether the timekeeper or referee should be responsible for calling time. In the end it was decided that official timekeepers should attend the Referees' Association meeting for instructions.\nIt was noted that the dead ball area on both fields at Carlaw Park had been reduced from 12 yards to 8 yards in accordance with the laws of rugby league.\nA rule change came into effect during the season after the annual meeting of the English Rugby League. They decided that no forward at any time in the scrum could have both feet off the ground. Also forwards could not drop to one knee to attempt to hook the ball. The game in New Zealand would adhere to these rules.\nRichard Stack benefit matches.\n The opening weekend of the season saw four first grade matches played at Carlaw Park, though these matches were not part of the competition. The round was dedicated to Richard Stack (commonly known as Dick Stack) of the Newton Rangers who had suffered a broken leg in the Stormont Shield final the previous season and the injury was so bad Auckland Hospital staff were forced to amputate it. This meant that he was unable to continue in his profession and so the league fundraised so that he was able to start his own business. A total of £500 was taken at the gates with 10,000 spectators in attendance. The day also featured a program of boxing matches with the prizes donated back to Stack. After all the accounts were balanced it was worked out that the fund for Stack totalled £610 12/3. An oddity of the games themselves was the low scoring nature and that all four losing teams failed to register a single point. Given the timing in the season and the fact they were for charity and competition points they were largely treated as practice matches with the City Rovers side using 18 players.\nMonteith Shield (First Grade Championship).\nMonteith Shield fixtures.\nRound 1 saw the newly promoted Ellerslie upset Ponsonby 15 points to 8. This was Ellerslie's first ever match in the first grade. The season was ceremonially kicked off by Miss Peggy Rhodes, daughter of George Rhodes, the chairman of Auckland Rugby League Management Committee.\nRound 4.\nIt was decided by Auckland Rugby League after the 3rd round that they would no longer play curtain-raiser matches by Senior A Grade teams at 1:30pm. This was due to players having difficulty getting to the ground on time as they often worked on Saturdays and had to travel from the outer suburbs. A recent example had been the Newton Rangers v Devonport match where several Newton players had arrived late and the match was so late kicking off that the second half lasted only 25 minutes instead of 40. Leslie Letton, a well known rugby player transferred from rugby union where he had been playing for Marist, and scored 2 tries for Ponsonby on debut in their 18–14 loss to Marist.\nRound 6.\nThe match between Richmond and Ellerslie was played on the Kings Birthday holiday as part of the celebrations.\nRound 7.\nFollowing the conclusion of the first round, \"The New Zealand Herald\" published the individual points tallies of all the point scorers. This was the first time this had been done. Taylor of Richmond led the standings with 46 points, Len Scott of Devonport had 33, while Craddock Dufty of Newton was third with 26 points.\nRound 12.\nThe New Zealand team was playing the 2nd test against England in Dunedin this weekend so all the Auckland players in the New Zealand side were unavailable for their club sides.\nRound 13.\nWilliam Mincham refereed approximately his 50th ever senior club match in the game at Ellerslie Reserve between Ellerslie and Richmond. He had begun refereeing in 1920 after retiring from playing. Mincham had represented Auckland and his son Ted Mincham and grand son Robert Mincham both represented New Zealand.\nRoope Rooster Knockout Competition.\nMarist won the Roope Rooster for 1928 after defeating Ponsonby in a closely contested final. It was the first time they had won the trophy in their history.\nSemifinals.\nExtra time was played in the Ponsonby match with Newton. Craddock Dufty was tackled into touch going for a try and the match ended a 5–5 draw with a replay required the following weekend.\nStormont Memorial Shield.\nMarist won the Stormont Shield (named after their former teammate William (Bill) Stormont) for the first time when they defeated the Monteith Shield champions Devonport with a late try by 9 points to 8.\nLabour Day Tournament.\nThe ‘Labour Day Tournament’ was played over two days (the official holiday, and the following Saturday). It featured Huntly from the Lower Waikato competition and Pt Chevalier who had won the second grade competition. Marist won the trophy despite having to win two games on the first day, and two more on the second. For their efforts they were awarded £50 in prize money. Future international Ted Mincham made his debut for Richmond and scored a try.\nA Division B Division promotion-relegation match.\nFor the second year in a row Ellerslie United and Grafton Athletic met in a match to decide who would play in the Senior A Division in 1929. Ellerslie scored a converted try in the closing stages of the match to remain in the A Grade.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nTop try and point scorers for A Division, Roope Rooster and Labour Day competitions (the three competitions all A Division teams competed in).\nNorton Cup (B Grade standings and results).\nNorton Cup results.\nRound 1 saw the opening of the new municipal ground (Stafford Park) at Northcote prior to Northcote and Birkenhead Ramblers match with Point Chevalier. The ground was opened by Northcote Mayor A. E. Greenslade who kicked off the ball to start the match. It was approximately the 21st ground in Auckland that had hosted an official senior club rugby league match. During the season Otahuhu asked the Otahuhu Borough Council for permission to take up a collection at the Princes St. Reserve and they also asked the council if they would erect a building. The council agreed to the collection but declined in regards to the building. On June 9 Sturges Park in Ōtāhuhu was used for the first time for an official senior rugby league game when Ōtāhuhu beat Māngere 7 to 5. Prior to the Round 11 matches Wirenui Mapi, the halfback of the Mangere team died after a short illness. The team wore white armbands for their match with Newton in honour of him.\nGrafton Athletic won the competition after an undefeated season.\nStallard Cup Knockout Competition.\nIn the first round of matches the referee (Mr. Hill) in the Otahuhu v Kingsland game stopped play early and awarded the game to Kingsland due to the rough play of the Otahuhu side. There were several fights during the match and the referee had difficulty keeping spectators off the field. According to the writer in the NZ Herald this “was not the first time the spectators at Otahuhu had made trouble, and they were really the cause of the players getting out of hand”.\nThe final saw Grafton and Point Chevalier tied at the end of normal time necessitating two extra periods of five minutes before Monaghan of Point Chevalier kicked a penalty goal to win the cup. This handed Point Chevalier their first ever senior trophy.\nOther club matches and lower grades.\nLower grade competitions.\nRichmond were awarded the Davis Points Shield for the most junior grade wins. They gained 75 points, with Devonport finishing second.\nSecond grade (Wright Cup).\nDevonport United won the championship, 6 points clear of Remuera, Ponsonby and Newton.

The North Island team fielded a large contingent of Auckland players including Craddock Dufty, Roy Hardgrave, Hec Brisbane, Maurice Wetherill, Stan Prentice, Frank Delgrosso, A. Scott, Lou Hutt, Wally Somers, and Jim O'Brien (Marist). The North Island team was far too good, winning 44 to 8. The following week a Probables v Possibles match was played as part of the selection process for the New Zealand team to play against the touring England side. The two teams featured the following Auckland players (Probables): Craddock Dufty, Len Scott, Hec Brisbane, Allan Seagar, Tim Peckham, Wally Somers, Jim O'Brien (Marist), Trevor Hall, Alf Scott, (Possibles): J Beattie, Trevor Hanlon, and Bill Cleaver.\nA match was also played by Auckland in Whangarei. This was the first time an Auckland representative team had played in Northland and they were up against a fledgling North Auckland side. The area was relatively lowly populated and it was thought that they could not sustain both competitive rugby union and rugby league sides. Auckland win relatively convincingly and rugby league was to continue to struggle in the area for some time. The final match of the season saw Auckland go down to South Auckland both physically and on the scoreboard by 21 points to 7. The Auckland team was below strength.\nRepresentative fixtures and trials.\nEngland Tour Match.\nThe entire Auckland Provincial team were Auckland club players aside from Joe Menzies\nAuckland players selected for New Zealand.\nThe following Auckland players were selected in the New Zealand team to play the first test versus England at Carlaw Park: Craddock Dufty (Newton), Roy Hardgrave (Newton), Claude List (Kingsland), Len Scott (Devonport), Maurice Wetherill (City), Stan Prentice (Richmond), Frank Delgrosso (Ponsonby), Lou Hutt (Ponsonby), Wally Somers (Newton), Jim O'Brien (Marist), Reserves: Tim Peckham (Ponsonby), and Trevor Hall (Newton). New Zealand won the test by 17 points to 13 in front of 27,000 spectators. Hec Brisbane who had not been considered for the first test due to injury was selected for the second test to be played in Dunedin and replaced Len Scott in the side.\nAnnual general meetings and club news.\nDetails of annual club meetings were as follows, along with notable news during the season."

        "text": "The final qualification repechage tournament for men's rugby sevens at the 2020 Summer Olympics was held on 18–20 June 2021 at Stade Louis II in Monaco. The tournament was originally scheduled for a year earlier, but was postponed until 2021 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nTwelve men's teams were eligible to compete in the repechage tournament, being the second and third ranked teams from the six continental qualifiers. Two teams, Brazil and China, withdrew a month before the competition due to challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. A third team, Uganda, had to withdraw after members of their squad recorded positive COVID-19 test results on arrival in Monaco. This reduced the number of teams competing to nine.\nIreland won the repechage tournament, defeating France by 28–19 in the final, to qualify for the men's sevens tournament at the Tokyo Olympics.\nPool stage.\nThe teams were drawn into two pools with each team playing against all opponents in their own pool. Due to the late withdrawal of Uganda, all matches involving them were recorded as a bye for their opponents in Pool B. \nCombined standings.\nAfter completion of the pool stage, the top two teams from each pool progressed to the knockout stage, with the winner of the final gaining qualification for the Olympic Sevens in Tokyo. Seedings for the knockouts were based on (a) pool placing, (b) competition points awarded (for a win, draw or loss) in the respective pool standings, and (c) difference between points scored and conceded across all pool matches played."

        "title": "Gymnastics elements named after Simone Biles",
        "text": "There are currently five elements in the Women's Artistic Gymnastics Code of Points named after American gymnast Simone Biles: two on vault, one on balance beam, and two on floor exercise.\nVault.\n\"Biles\".\nBiles debuted her vault, a \"roundoff, back handspring with half turn entry; front stretched somersault with 2 twists\" (an upgrade from the Cheng) at the selection camp for the 2018 World Championships. During qualifications at the 2018 World Championships Biles successfully landed the new vault and it was therefore named after her and assigned a difficulty value of 6.4, tying it as the most difficult vault in Women's Artistic Gymnastics with the Produnova. As of , Biles is the only woman who has performed the \"Biles\" vault.\n\"Biles II\".\nAt the 2021 U.S. Classic Biles debuted a Yurchenko double pike vault, which no woman had ever competed before. She submitted the skill to be added to the code of points at the Olympic Games in Tokyo. It was assigned a difficulty of 6.6, which would make it the most difficult vault in Women's Artistic Gymnastics. However, Biles did not perform the vault as she withdrew from most event finals after experiencing \"the twisties\", a psychological phenomenon causing a gymnast to lose air awareness while performing twisting elements, throughout the Olympics. At the 2023 World Championships in Antwerp, Belgium, Biles successfully completed the vault. It was assigned a difficulty of 6.4. Biles incurred a neutral deduction of 0.5 for having her coach on the mat as a spotter for safety.\nBalance beam.\n\"Biles\".\nBiles first started training the \"double-twisting double-tucked salto backwards dismount\" off of the balance beam in 2013; however she never performed it during the 2013–16 quad including the Olympics. Prior to making her comeback Biles posted a video, teasing new upgrades including the double-double dismount off of the balance beam. Biles debuted the new dismount at the 2019 U.S. National Championships. She submitted it as a new skill at the 2019 World Championships where it was given the rating H, the highest rating of any skill performed on the balance beam. Biles expressed disappointment at the skill being undervalued, citing similar maneuvers on different apparatuses and their ratings:\nUSA Gymnastics backed Biles, also expressing that the skill did not receive the rating it merited; during domestic events over the summer, USAG assigned the skill a provisional I rating. The FIG explained that the reason for the lower than expected rating is due to safety concerns due to the \"added risk in landing of double saltos for Beam dismounts (with/without twists), including a potential landing on the neck.\" Many people made counterpoints to the FIG's concern over safety. British gymnast Ruby Harrold made the point that FIG does not \"allow a warm-up immediately prior to event finals\" and others cited how Jamaican gymnast Danusia Francis has frequently been denied being able to have an extra mat to make her balance beam dismount safer. Some argued that Biles was being penalized for being able to safely perform skills that are so difficult that it would be reckless for other gymnasts to even attempt them. However, others noted that Biles is not the first gymnast to have a skill undervalued by the FIG Women's Technical Committee and that several of her other eponymous skills are rated correctly. While the skill was not rated as highly as Biles hoped, it remains the highest-valued skill on balance beam in the Code of Points.\nDespite the rating controversy, Biles successfully performed the new dismount during qualifications at the 2019 World Championships and the skill was therefore named after her.\nFloor exercise.\n\"Biles\".\nBiles debuted her new floor exercise skill, a \"double layout with a half twist\", at podium training for the 2013 U.S. Classic, eight years after London Phillips completed it domestically in 2005. Biles was able to successfully complete the skill at the 2013 World Championships and the skill was therefore named after her. Six years later Trinity Thomas performed the \"Biles\" successfully at the 2019 U.S. National Championships, becoming the third woman to complete the skill. Gabrielle Clark completed the \"Biles\" in 2021 at the LA Gold gymnastic meet in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nAt the 2023 World Championships, Hillary Heron of Panama became the first gymnast to perform one of Biles' named skills at a major international competition.\nGymnasts who have completed the Biles (FX).\nAs of , five gymnasts have completed the \"Biles\" on floor exercise.\n\"Biles II\".\nBiles started training a \"triple-twisting double-tucked salto backwards\" (upgraded from a Silivas) in 2013. In 2019, she performed it at the U.S. Classic during podium training but not the competition. The first time Biles completed the maneuver in competition was at the 2019 U.S. National Championships, joining male gymnasts Ri Jong Song of North Korea and Kenzo Shirai and Kohei Uchimura, both of Japan. Biles completed the skill during qualification at the 2019 World Championships, and it was therefore named after her. It was given the rating J, making it the highest rated skill across all apparatuses in Women's Artistic Gymnastics.\nNo other woman had completed the skill as of , although American gymnasts Jade Carey and MyKayla Skinner have posted videos of them training the skill. During podium training at the 2021 U.S. Classic, Carey performed the laid-out version of this skill, which she submitted to be added to the code of points at the 2020 Olympic Games. It was assigned a difficulty of \"K\", but Carey never competed the skill during competition."

        "text": "The men's vault competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics was held at Earls Court Exhibition Centre on 12 and 13 August. It was the seventh appearance of the event. There were 120 competitors from 16 nations, with each nation sending a team of up to 8 gymnasts. The event was won by Paavo Aaltonen of Finland with fellow Finn Olavi Rove finishing second; the medals were the nation's first in the men's vault. There was a three-way tie for third place resulting in three bronze medals being awarded to János Mogyorósi-Klencs and Ferenc Pataki of Hungary and Leo Sotorník of Czechoslovakia.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). One of the top 10 gymnasts from 1936 returned: seventh-place finisher Michael Reusch of Switzerland. There had been no world championship yet after World War II, so the reigning two-time world champion was 40-year-old Eugen Mack, who had won Olympic gold in 1928 and silver in 1936; he did not compete.\nArgentina, Cuba, Denmark, Egypt, and Mexico each made their debut in the men's vault. The United States made its sixth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format. The event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004). Each nation entered a team of up to eight gymnasts (Cuba and Argentina had only 7; Mexico only 5), though 3 gymnasts did not compete in the vault (one each from Austria, Mexico, and the United States). All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus, with the scores summed to give a final total. The scores in each of the six apparatus competitions were added together to give individual all-around scores; the top six individual scores on each team were summed to give a team all-around score. No separate finals were contested.\nFor each exercise, four judges gave scores from 0 to 10 in one-tenth point increments. The top and bottom scores were discarded and the remaining two scores summed to give the exercise total. If the two scores were sufficiently far apart, the judges would \"confer\" and decide on a score. Thus, exercise scores ranged from 0 to 20, apparatus scores from 0 to 40, individual totals from 0 to 240, and team scores from 0 to 1,440. For the vault, each gymnast attempted both the compulsory and voluntary vaults twice, with the better score counting."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Joseph Hooker",
        "text": "An equestrian statue of Joseph Hooker (sometimes called \"General Joseph Hooker\") is installed outside the Massachusetts State House, facing Beacon Street in Boston, in the United States. \nHooker, a native of Hadley, Massachusetts, was a United States Army officer in the Mexican–American War and a major general in the United States Civil War. His statue stands about high and was unveiled in June 1903 to an artillery salute, during a ceremony attended by military and civilian officials.\nHistory.\nThe 1903 bronze sculpture was designed by Daniel Chester French and Edward Clark Potter, and rests on a granite base. It was surveyed as part of the Smithsonian Institution's \"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\" program in 1997.\nLegislators approved US$55,000 in public funds to commission the statue. The statue originally included a bronze plaque bearing the words \"A Soldier in the Army that Kept the Nation Whole\". Veterans' groups demanded the removal of this inscription, as they felt it diminished Hooker's leadership role in the war.\nThough popular with his troops, Hooker's memorialization in one of the most prominent locations in Massachusetts has been controversial. The historian Charles Francis Adams Jr., who served as a colonel in the Civil War, was quoted as saying he refused to walk on the same side of the street as the statue: \"I look upon [the statue] as an opprobrium cast on every genuine Massachusetts man who served in the Civil War. Hooker in no way and in no degree represents the typical soldiership of the Commonwealth.\"\nIn 2017, amid the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials in the Southern United States, the \"Boston Globe\" said the Joseph Hooker statue belongs to \"the category known as Why Are These Statues Even Here At All?\" The newspaper quoted Peter Drummey of the Massachusetts Historical Society as stating that \"Hooker didn't have a very good reputation as a soldier or as a person.\" Drummey speculated that rather than honoring the person himself, the presence of the Joseph Hooker statue at the State House is a testament to the political power of veterans' groups.\nThe Hooker statue, along with the nearby statue of Mary Dyer, remained open to the public even after the September 11 attacks in 2001 prompted state authorities to close the gates to the State House lawn, limiting access to statues of Anne Hutchinson, John F. Kennedy, Henry Cabot Lodge, Horace Mann and Daniel Webster.\nGeneral Hooker Entrance.\nThe statue stands in front of, and lends its name to, the main public entrance to the State House. The large sign reading \"General Hooker Entrance\" is often the source of double entendres, particularly from groups of schoolchildren on field trips. In 2011, for example, actor Kevin Bacon tweeted a photo of the entrance with the question, \"Where do special hookers enter?\" State Representative Michelle DuBois, a Democrat from Brockton, called for the name of the entrance to be changed in 2018, saying it is \"tone deaf\" and shows \"disregard for the majority of women's feelings and dignity for the raising up and false-protection of a statue of a long-dead general\". She said women who work in the State House face uncomfortable \"good-old-boy, schoolyard jokes\" because of the name. Governor Charlie Baker and other state officials rejected the notion of making changes to the sign."

The second round saw the rest of the field over 74, Bigot solidifying his hold on third with a 78.06m and Fajdek improving to 80.16m. In the third, Henriksen challenged the podium with a 77.38m. It took exactly 76 metres just to get three more throws. In the fourth round Nowicki upped his challenge to 77.42m, Bigot edged into silver position with a 78.19m and then Fajdek landed the winner . In the fifth round, Mykhaylo Kokhan threw a personal best 77.39m, then in the final frame, Nowicki dropped his best of 77.69m, originally not enough to get onto the podium.\nHowever, after the competition, the Polish delegation protested the officials call on Halász in the first round, claiming his stepping outside of the circle, a foul, being missed. On further review, IAAF decided the officials acted improperly but the early call affected the rest of way Halász performed in the competition.

The same two topped the semi-final round. Dalilah Muhammad and Sydney McLaughlin, but which one would be the favorite? McLaughlin had more superior times and had beaten Muhammad 2 to 1. The 1, Muhammad had to set the world record to beat McLaughlin and win the USA Championships on a rain soaked track in Des Moines. And McLaughlin was still improving. She ran those fast times while still a teenager, turning 20 late in the season.\nIn the final, Muhammad did what she had to do, she went out hard. She was first over the first hurdle and continued to pull ahead, making up the stagger on Sage Watson to her outside before the end of the turn. But McLaughlin was not giving up too much ground, two lanes to the inside, passing Rushell Clayton between them just after entering the backstretch. Before the end of the backstretch, Muhammad had made up another stagger on two time World Champion Zuzana Hejnová. Through the final turn, both were well in front, Muhammad taking the hurdles about a full stride ahead of McLaughlin. When they hit the home straight, Muhammad had about a 3-metre lead. That gap stayed consistent over the final two barriers, but coming off the final hurdle, McLaughlin made up a meter in the first three steps and she was coming on fast. The gap was closing as the finish line neared. Both athletes leaned for the line with Muhammad holding on for a half metre victory. Clayton finished a second and a half back to take bronze.\nMuhammad had beaten her own world record set just two months earlier by .04. She ran 52.16. McLaughlin had run the #3 time in history, 52.23. The only thing separating the two was Muhammad's previous world record run. Just as in the 1995 World Championships, two American hurdlers had pushed each other to be the #1 and 2 performers in history.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+3), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first four in each heat (Q) and the next four fastest (q) qualified for the semifinal.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first 2 in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 4 October at 21:30."

        "text": "Namibia competed at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, from 27 September to 6 October 2019. The country's participation there marked its fifteenth appearance in the World Championships since its debut at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics. Namibia sent two athletes to the Championships, both of whom competed in the marathon events. Helalia Johannes became Namibia's first female medallist, and their first medallist in 26 years, when she won a bronze medal in the women's marathon. Tomas Hilifa Rainhold finished in 17th in the men's marathon.\nBackground.\nNamibia first competed in the World Athletics Championships (then known as the World Championships in Athletics) in 1991, and have taken part in every Championships since. During that period two athletes won five medals for the country. Their most recent medal had come during the 1997 Championships. To qualify for the World Championships, athletes had to meet the standards set by the IAAF (now known as World Athletics). In most disciplines, these criteria were more difficult to achieve than they had been for the 2017 Championships. Two athletes represented Namibia at the 2019 Championships: Tomas Hilifa Rainhold in the men's marathon and Helalia Johannes in the women's marathon. Rainhold qualified for the Championships courtesy of completing the Hamburg Marathon in 2:14:14, 1 minute and 46 seconds within the required standard of 2:16:00. Johannes, who was the reigning Commonwealth champion after winning the 2018 marathon had set a new Namibia national record in March 2019, running 2:22:25 to win the Nagoya Women's Marathon, well within the required 2:37:00. The two athletes were accompanied by their coach Robert Kaxuxuena.\nResults.\nJohannes, taking part in her fourth World Championships, raced in the women's marathon on the opening night of the Championships. Due to the hot conditions expected in Doha, the race started just before midnight. In the IAAF's preview of the race, Johannes was considered \"one to watch\" by the sports writer Mike Rowbottom, particularly because her Commonwealth Games victory the previous year had been in temperatures of around . Despite the midnight start, temperatures in Doha were higher than expected, at and 73 per cent humidity. Johannes was part of a leading pack that broke away around into the race, and she stayed with the leaders until there was around of the race remaining, at which stage Ruth Chepng'etich and Rose Chelimo moved away from her. Johannes held onto third place, and finished in 2:34:15, around 30 seconds behind Chelimo and over a minute ahead of Edna Kiplagat in fourth. She became the first female medallist for Namibia at the World Championships.\nRainhold was making his debut at the World Championships. Competing in the men's marathon, which was also held just before midnight, Rainhold ran what the \"Namibian Sun\" described as \"a good race\". He completed the race in 2:14:38, and finished in 17th place. Namibia's solitary bronze medal saw them finish joint 31st on the Championships medal table."

        "title": "2020 Premier Lacrosse League season",
        "text": "The 2020 Premier Lacrosse League season was the second season for the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL). The season was originally set to begin on May 29 and culminate with a championship game played in late September. Due to the spread of COVID-19, the league postponed the start of their season, and in May announced their season would take place as a championship series between July 25 and August 9, replacing NBCUniversal's coverage of the 2020 Summer Olympics. The Championship Series consisted of playoff seedings based on 4 games of group play taking place at Zions Bank Stadium just outside of Salt Lake City, Utah. The series began with the Whipsnakes Lacrosse Club as the defending league champions and the Waterdogs Lacrosse Club joining the league as an expansion team.\nExpansion.\nThe addition of a seventh team, the Waterdogs Lacrosse Club, allows for natural bye weeks to occur for each team throughout the season. Paul Rabil first hinted at expansion in a post game interview after the 2019 Championship game. On January 1, 2020, the Premier Lacrosse League announced the Waterdogs identity. An expansion draft took place on February 12 and an entry draft will occur in March to build the new roster with veteran players.\nChampionship Series Schedule.\nSince this season was affected by COVID-19, it was called the PLL Championship Series. The season began on July 25 – August 9.\nIn their \"quest for the crown,\" seven teams competed in the 14 Group Play games that determined playoff seeding leading into the Elimination Round. The remaining teams that were not eliminated moved onto the Semifinals, and lastly, the PLL Championship. All 20 games were played without fans at Zions Bank Stadium in Herriman, Utah and broadcast four games live on NBC, ten games on NBCSN, and live streamed on NBC Sports Gold.\nExpansion Draft.\nThe 2020 expansion draft occurred on February 12 for the Waterdogs Lacrosse Club to build their initial roster. The original 6 Lacrosse Clubs submitted a roster of 11 protected players (1 goalie and 10 positional players) to the PLL. These 11 players were not available for selection by the seventh Lacrosse Club in the Expansion Draft. Any player, with the exception of active military members and rookie holdouts, not protected by their club was entered into the pool for selection by the Waterdogs.\nFormat:\nPlayer Entry Draft.\nThe 2020 player entry draft occurred on March 16 for teams to select players arriving from rival Major League Lacrosse. On March 4, Paul Burmeister and NBCSN hosted an entry draft lottery for selection order. Out of 100 balls to select from, Waterdogs had 40, Chrome had 25, Atlas had 15, Archers had 10, Chaos had 6, Redwoods had 3, and the champion Whipsnakes had 1.\nRob Pannell was announced to be transferring to the PLL on March 9, followed by 15 other players the following day, which comprised the selection pool for the entry draft. A total of 14 players were selected in the entry draft with remaining new players entering the league player pool.\nCollege Draft.\nThe 2020 collegiate draft occurred on May 13 after being reschedule due to COVID-19 concerns. The draft was broadcast on NBCSN and featured a condensed format. With many seniors choosing to return to school on an extra year of eligibility granted by the NCAA and the PLL season being condensed into a prime time tournament, the 2020 draft was conducted through two rounds. All previous draft pick trade rights from the past season were transferred to the 2021 draft.\nFormat:\nChampionship.\nThe top-ranked, undefeated and PLL defending champs, the Whipsnakes became the repeat champions when they won their second straight championship by winning against the low-seeded, but red-hot Chaos by a score of 12–6.\nIn the opening first three quarters, great defense by Chaos shutdown the Whipsnakes. \nHowever, in the fourth quarter Chaos weren't able to stop the Whipsnakes as they went on a 10–0 run fueled by attackman Zed Williams, along with Matt Rambo assists. \nWilliams tied the PLL single-game record with 6 goals, scoring 5 in the fourth quarter alone and was named Tournament MVP. \nRatings.\nThis season's PLL Championship Game brought in a Total Audience Delivery (TAD) of 340,000 viewers on NBC, outperforming the 2019 Championship Game (276,000 viewers) by an impressive 23%.\nAll 14 combined broadcasts on NBC and NBCSN averaged 153,000 Total Viewers, an increase of 33% over the 2019 inaugural PLL season.\nAwards.\nAll-Tournament Team.\nAttack: Zed Williams (Whipsnakes), Matt Rambo (Whipsnakes), Josh Byrne (Chaos)\nMidfield: Tom Schreiber (Archers), Michael Ehrhardt (Whipsnakes), Joe Nardella (Whipsnakes)\nDefense: Matt Dunn (Whipsnakes), Jack Rowlett (Chaos), Garrett Epple (Redwoods)\nGoalie: Blaze Riorden (Chaos)\nSource:"

        "title": "1927 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": " The 1927 Auckland Rugby League season was its 18th. Newton defeated Ponsonby by 6 points to 3 in the championship final to win the Monteith Shield after both teams finished the season tied with identical 8 win, 1 draw, 3 loss records. This was the second time Newton had won the championship in 18 efforts, with the first being in 1912 and was to be their last after they merged decades later with City Rovers and the combined team ceased in the early 2000s. Richmond won the Roope Rooster knockout trophy for the second consecutive season. Newton Rangers defeated Richmond to win the Stormont Shield.\nEllerslie won the Norton Cup by winning the second division competition, known as the B Grade at this time. They were undefeated and also won the Stallard Cup which was the B Grade knockout trophy. Interestingly the league played a 'promotion-relegation' match, with Ellerslie by virtue of winning the Norton Cup for winning the B Grade playing off with Grafton, who had finished last in the A Grade. Ellerslie won 11–3 over Grafton thus winning the right to compete in the A grade competition in the 1928 season. Despite this there was still considerable discussion at the annual general meeting the following year as to whether or not Ellerslie be admitted to the A Grade. It was eventually decided that they would be, with Grafton dropping to the B Grade.\nOther trophies awarded (at the 1928 annual general meeting of the Auckland Rugby League) were the Davis Points Shield to Richmond, the Thistle Cup to Newton, and a special cup for the best forward to W.Clark from Newton.\n \n \nAuckland rugby league news.\nTransfers.\nA McIntyre who had been playing in Sydney joined the Newton club.\nAnnual meetings of Auckland Rugby League.\nThe annual report for the 1927 season stated that the total revenue for Auckland Rugby League was £5,597, with £4,216 taken at the gates. At the annual meeting of the Junior Management Committee of the Auckland Rugby League on 23 March it was stated in their report that junior players exceeded 1,500. It was also reported that the Remuera League Club was being revived. They had fielded two junior teams in 1914, and appeared to have the numbers to enter two junior teams in the 1927 season. On 10 August the Auckland Rugby League Chairman, Mr. W.J. Hammill tendered his resignation for business reasons. He had occupied the position for five years. He was congratulated on his contribution to the game and made a life member of the League. Mr. George Rhodes was elected as the new chairman of the Management Committee.\nRepresentative season.\nAuckland began the season with a match against the returning members of the New Zealand team that had toured England from August 1926 to January 1927. There was some controversy in that Joe Menzies had played for the 'New Zealand team' despite being from the South Auckland (Waikato) province and the New Zealand Rugby League questioned the Auckland Rugby League on the selection. One possible reason for his selection may have been the fact that Arthur Singe had been banned for life after going on strike during the tour along with 6 other players. This meant that there was one less Auckland forward to pick for the match. Auckland won the game 24–21. They went on a southern tour later in the season and played matches against Canterbury, West Coast, Otago, and Wellington. After their return to Auckland they played against Buller and South Auckland. The Buller side was coached by Bill Davidson who had spent many years playing for City Rovers, Auckland, and played for New Zealand from 1919 to 1921. He had later moved to the Canterbury region where he was involved in sporting administration. He later returned to Auckland and coached Ponsonby in the 1938 season. Auckland lost the Northern Union Challenge Cup to South Auckland in their final game of the season.\nMonteith Shield (first grade championship).\nMonteith Shield results.\nAfter two completed rounds Newton and Ponsonby were both tied on 19 competition points. This necessitated a final between the two sides and this was won by Newton 6–3.\nRound 1.\nJim O'Brien and J Stormont (ex-Marist players) had both retired from the game and were spectators at the match between Marist and Grafton. However, after watching they decided to come out of retirement and resume playing for their old team. Meanwhile Craddock Dufty returned to play for Newton after 5 years with Grafton Athletic. Les Bull refereed his 50th match involving senior rugby league teams in Auckland and was the third man to do this after Archie Ferguson (1912–22) and Billy Murray (1913-25).\nRound 2.\nPrior to round 2 Wigan made an offer to Lou Brown of the City side, while Ben Davidson had reportedly received one from Hull. Future New Zealand coach Bill Telford debuted for Richmond and scored a try in their 15–15 draw with City. In the same match brothers Ken and Ray Hyland clashed heads diving to save a try with the result that Ken had to leave the field and Ray had to bandage his bleeding head to continue.\nRound 3.\n Jim O'Brien and Stewart were both sent off for fighting near the Richmond try line in the Marist v Richmond match. Grafton only had 12 players make the trip to Devonport Domain where they were thrashed by Devonport 47–3. Nelson Bass tore his knee cartilage in the match between City and Ponsonby and was forced into early retirement. Arthur Rae made his first grade refereeing debut in the match between Devonport and Grafton on the Devonport Domain.\nRound 5.\nThe Devonport v Richmond match was played on the Friday as part of the King's Birthday celebrations. It was notable for the fact that 4 players were ordered off. Neville St George who had had words with the referee was sent from the field, two minutes later Stewart from Richmond joined him and Stan Prentice (Richmond), and Jim O'Brien (Devonport) soon followed. Leslie Knott scored two tries for Marist. At the end of the season he became the Auckland singles tennis champion and New Zealand doubles champion before moving to Australia to advance his career.\nRound 6.\nCity were without the services of Lou Brown, Maurice Wetherill, G Brown, Nelson Bass and Alf Townsend and were soundly beaten by Marist. Frank Delgrosso of Ponsonby was ordered off in their match with Devonport.\nRound 7.\nCity had lost the services of Lou Brown and Ben Davidson who had both been signed by Wigan during the week. They would depart for England later in the month. In their match with Devonport two players for Newton left the field injured during the second half leaving them with 11 players.\nRound 8.\nCity were further weakened after Alf Townsend was transferred to Dunedin permanently for work during the week. In the Marist match with Grafton, Norman King broke a bone in his hand and had to leave the field.\nRound 9.\nCity sought to strengthen their side due to the large number of players who had departed. They signed Godkin, a Bay of Plenty rugby player, Pascoe a Manukau rugby player, and E Spencer a league representative from the Waimairi club in Canterbury. Te Huia Hawira Mason also joined the City side from Huntly (Len Mason's brother). Devonport captain Jim O'Brien was ordered off in their loss to Marist. At the conclusion of the match the referee (H. Taylor) was escorted from the field by two police officers as several spectators crowded and heckled him. Opponents Jack Kirwan and his namesake Jim O'Brien (Marist) had tried to plead his case to the referee to allow him to stay on the field and the Devonport later wrote a letter to the Marist club thanking them. Taylor had replaced Wally Ripley as referee after Ripley fell ill before the match. The match between Newton and Ponsonby at the Auckland Domain was postponed due to the ground being unfit for play. He was suspended for their following match. The following weekend saw all games suspended and the postponed match played at Carlaw Park. Ironically rain fell throughout the match and the field \"was badly churned up as the game progressed\".\nRound 10.\nRichmond lost captain Jim Parkes who was moving back to Christchurch to join the Hornby club. The match between Devonport and Grafton was postponed due to the unfit nature of the field at the Auckland Domain. It was played on the following weekend at Devonport with other fixtures from that round not played due to the Auckland Rugby League making Carlaw Park available for the soccer match between New Zealand and Canada. Ponsonby fielded 3 brothers, future New Zealand international Tim Peckham, and his older brother Joseph, and younger brother Kenneth.\nRound 13.\n Bert Avery was carried off the field with concussion in the Newton match against Grafton. He had been attempting to tackle M Herewini who tried to hurdle him and made contact with Avery's head. Avery was taken to Auckland Hospital where he eventually recovered. His brother Henry who was also a league played died later in the week after a bout of pneumonia and Bert Avery decided to retire after many years playing for and captaining Grafton and New Zealand.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nRound 1.\nCraddock Dufty and captain W Clarke were both out injured from the Newton side for their match with Marist. Hamilton went off injured for City meaning they had to finish the match with Richmond with 12 players. The scores were tied at the end of the match 17–17 so 5 minutes extra time was played with Bill Telford scoring and Edmund Carroll converting to win the game for Richmond. This was the first time extra time had been used to decide a game in an Auckland Rugby League senior competition. Usually matches were replayed the following week.\nSemi finals.\nThe Auckland representative team had left for their southern tour and so all teams were fielding greatly weakened sides. Holmes, a rugby representative three-quarter signed for Devonport just before their game with Ponsonby.\nFinal.\nA. Finlayson switched codes to join Richmond signing one minute before kick off so as to keep the switch secret. The following week he applied for reinstatement into rugby union. Richmond won the Roope Rooster for the second consecutive year. It was a case of déjà vu with another 1 pt victory over Devonport who they had beaten the year before.\nStormont Memorial Shield.\nNewton won the match by 25 points to 14, but the match was noteworthy due to the large number of injuries suffered. G. Norman the Newton captain was concussed and had his jaw broken, Dick Stack fractured his leg, W. Rhodes broke his collar-bone, and Wally Somers sprained his ankle. The first three players were all taken to Auckland Hospital, while Somers was taken home. Stacks leg injury was so bad in fact that his leg had to be amputated and he spent many months in hospital. There were several matches in the following season used to raise funds for him and his family.\nA Grade/B Grade promotion-relegation match.\nAt the conclusion of the A and B division competitions the last placed Grafton Athletic from the A Division played against the winners of the B Division Ellerslie for the right to compete in the A Division in 1928. Ellerslie won the match by 11 points to 3 thus earning themselves a place in A Division and forcing Grafton Athletic to play in the lower grade. This was the first time in Auckland Rugby League competition that such a match had been played.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nTop try and point scorers for A Division, Roope Rooster and Stormont Shield competitions.\nB Division (Norton Cup) standings and results.\nA large number of games did not have the scores reported in either \"The New Zealand Herald\" or the \"Auckland Star\". As a result, the fixtures list is incomplete as is the final standings. Results are missing as follows, Kingsland x 2, Parnell x 1, Mangere x 4, Point Chevalier x 1, and Otahuhu x 1). In addition there were two cancelled matches. The round 4 match between Mangere and Kingsland did not have the result reported though it was said several weeks later that Kingsland was undefeated so they must have won the match. The Ellerslie match with Mangere on July 9 is missing the score so Ellerslie and Mangere teams for and against is incomplete.\nB Division (Norton Cup) fixtures.\nThe Round 8 match between Mangere and Northcote was not played due to the condition of the ground at Mangere. However, after an inquiry it was stated that the Mangere team was willing to play and the referee said the match could go ahead. The Northcote team thought the match shouldn't be played and did not take the field. They also complained that they had to get changed underneath a gorse bush while a local official said there was a dressing room at Northcote's disposal. The league awarded the match to Mangere. The Round 15 match between Otahuhu and Northcote at the Auckland Domain was not played due to the condition of the field.\nOn May 14 Walker Park in Point Chevalier was used for the first time for a genuine senior grade match when Point Chevalier beat Māngere 9–5. It was approximately the 20th different ground to be used for senior rugby league in Auckland since its origins in 1908.\nOther club matches and lower grades.\nLower grade competitions.\nSecond grade (Wright Cup).\nDevonport won the competition with a season record of played 14, won 13, lost 1, points for 252 and against 62. Devonport also won knock out competition (Foster Shield) when they beat Remuera 15 to 7 on October 8 at Carlaw Park. City withdrew after 3 rounds, Grafton Athletic (Maritime) withdrew after 4 rounds, and Marist withdrew after round 15 near the end of the season. Newton entered a side in the knockout competition but were knocked out by Devonport immediately 32 points to 0. Ponsonby lost their semi final to Devonport, while Mangere were the other losing semi finalists, going down to Remuera 12 to 5.\nThird grade open (Walker Shield).\nNew Lynn won the competition by one point after a 3–3 draw with Grafton Athletic on July 30. The majority of match results were not reported so the standings are significantly incomplete. Grafton Athletic (Maritime) won the knockout competition when they defeated Devonport 12–3 on September 24. Grafton had beaten Glen Eden 3–2 in one semi final while Devonport beat Ponsonby 6–3 in the other semi final. Northcote withdrew from the championship after 7 rounds.\nThird grade intermediate.\nThere were several results not reported and the winner of the championship was never reported in any of the Auckland newspapers however in the 1949 Rugby League Annual it was stated that Richmond B had won this championship. Interestingly the following season at the Auckland Rugby League annual meeting when trophies were presented to winning teams in all grades there was none presented in this grade, possibly because it was an intermediate grade and only in its second year of competition. Richmond had won it in 1926 and won it again in 1928. The Richmond A team won the knockout competition when they defeated City in the final on October 8 by 20 points to 0. City had beaten Parnell 20–2 in one semi-final, while Richmond A won their semi-final 5–0 against Newton. Devonport withdrew from the championship after 16 rounds near the end of the season.\nFourth grade (Hospital Cup).\nRichmond won the championship. Devonport won the knockout competitions when they beat Richmond 12–5 in the final on October 15. Richmond beat Remuera 19–0 in one semi final while Devonport beat Grafton Athletic (Maritime) in the other by 24 points to 2.\nFifth grade (Endean Shield).\nAkarana won the championship. Not all of the results were reported so the standings are incomplete. They also won the knockout competition when they beat City in the final on October 15 by 7 points to 3. Newton withdrew from the competition after 4 rounds.\nSixth grade A.\nAkarana won the championship after beating Grafton Athletic (Maritime) 11 to 5 in the final on August 27.

It was the Marist clubs first ever junior grade trophy.\nSchoolboys competition.\nOtahuhu was a combination of students from several schools in the area and as such did not represent Otahuhu Primary School. The other schools were from the individual schools though the Papatoetoe school side had some players from the local Orphanage too. Newton Central Primary School entered a team in some matches late in the season and Newmarket Primary school entered a second side around the same time.\nExhibition matches.\nDevonport v Ponsonby.\nThe final match of the season was one played by Devonport against Ponsonby for charity. The money raised was given to the Mayor's unemployment fund.\nRepresentative season.\nThe Auckland teams for the season were to be selected by Ernie Asher, Edward Vincent Fox, and Alan Blakey.

With few remaining D-II programs, the tournament dropped the regional selections and took the two teams with the best records, coincidentally they were both members of ECAC Northeast. The division was dealt a further blow when another handful of programs announced they would follow suit after the '99 season. With so few Division II schools fielding varsity ice hockey teams, the NCAA decided to suspend the D-II Tournament at the conclusion of the season.

        "text": " \nThe 2011 Challenge Cup Final was the 110th cup-deciding game of the rugby league 2011 Challenge Cup Season. It was held at Wembley Stadium in London on 27 August 2011, kick off 14:30. The final was contested by Leeds Rhinos and Wigan Warriors. The game saw Wigan beat Leeds by 28 points to 18.\nRoute to the final.\nLeeds Rhinos.\nLeeds Rhinos drew Celtic Crusaders in the fourth round, beating the soon to be relegated side 30 points to 20. A fifth round victory over relegation survivors Harlequins, winning by double the point, saw progression to the quarter finals where a comfortable away win against Hull F.C. booked the Rhinos a place in the smi-finals. Lewis's final game before the final saw an extra time win over Castleford Tigers following an eight all draw after the full eighty.\nWigan Warriors.\nWigan Warriors drew eventual Championship relegation side Barrow Raiders in the fourth round, trashing them 52 nill. A tight 26–22 over Bradford Bulls saw the Warriors progress to the quarter finals, where they beat eventual Super League league leaders Warrington Wolves 44 to 24 thus progressing to the semis. The semi-finals saw a Good Friday derby victory over St Helens, beating them 18–12 to book their place in the final.\nBackground and Pre-match.\nThe two sides with the most Challenge Cup Final appearances had only met twice before, Wigan winning both times (1994 and 1995). Leeds had played in the previous year's Challenge Cup final loss, but it was the Wigan's Warriors' first visit to the new Wembley Stadium. Abide with me was sung by Rhydian Roberts.\nThe game was broadcast by BBC with John Kear and Dave Woods commentating, as well as additional commentary from Tanya Arnold, Clare Balding, Jonathan Davies, Robbie Hunter-Paul, Justin Morgan and Brian Noble. The national anthem of England was then sung before referee Phil Bentham, overseeing his first Challenge Cup final, blew time on and Leeds' captain Kevin Sinfield kicked off.\nMatch details.\nFirst half.\nThe first points of the match came in the ninth minute when Wigan, having made their way into Leeds' half of the field, moved the ball through the hands to the right winger Josh Charnley, who side-stepped the defence and crashed over the line. Pat Richards missed the attempted conversion so the score remained 0-4 in favour of the Warriors. Wigan were again attacking from fifteen metres out when their prop Jeff Lima ran onto Paul Prescott's short pass, and into a defensive gap to dive over near the goal posts just before the twenty-four-minute mark. Richards' conversion was successful so Wigan were leading 0-10. In the twenty-eighth minute, Warriors fullback Sam Tomkins was returning the Leeds' kick from within his own ten metres, running across-field before passing the ball out to his brother, right centre Joel Tomkins. Racing down the sideline, he palmed off one defender and had run seventy metres before he stepped back inside and in between the converging Rhinos defenders, continuing on straight to the centre of the goal-line to dive over under the posts for what was described as one of the great Wembley tries. Richards put the kick over so Wigan were in front 0-16.\nIt took until the thirty-fifth minute for Leeds to get on the scoreboard when, having worked the ball up to within the opposition ten-metre line, they kept the ball alive, moving it quickly though the hands out to left winger Ryan Hall who dived over untouched in the corner. Sinfield's difficult conversion attempt rebounded against the goal post back into the field so Wigan's lead remained 4-16. Only two minutes later, Leeds had made their way back into opposition territory, again keeping the ball alive with deft passing, this time getting it out to right winger Ben Jones-Bishop who barged his way over the try-line to score. Sinfield kicked the conversion successfully, bringing the half-time score to 10-16 in the Warriors' favour.\nSecond half.\nThe first eighteen minutes of the second half saw a tight arm-wrestle between the two sides. Then Leeds, having won a scrum from Wigan's error inside their own ten-metre line, moved the ball right to centre Carl Ablett who muscled his way through the defence and onto the try-line. The video referee, Steve Ganson gave the try and Sinfield's goal-kick was wide, leaving the Rhinos trailing the Warriors 14-16. Wigan, having advanced into an attacking position, scored again when Lee Mossop's controversial-looking short pass to Jeff Lima sent the prop forward again crashing over the try line beside the uprights just before the sixty-two-minute mark. Richards converted the try for Wigan to lead 14-22.\nWith nine minutes of the match remaining, Leeds were down at the opposition's end and on the fifth tackle moved the ball through the hands out to their left winger, Ryan Hall to barge through the defence and over the try-line. Sinfield couldn't kick the sideline conversion so Leeds trailed 18-22. After receiving the kick-off, the Rhinos made a good break through right winger Ben Jones-Bishop, who kicked the ball ahead into the in-goal area where neither of the Leeds or Wigan chasers racing though could secure it. With less than two and a half minutes remaining, the Warriors were on Leeds' ten-metre line when dummy-half Tommy Leuluai ran through some tired marker defence to get over the line. The video referee was called upon to rule that the ball was not lost in the attempted grounding and the try was awarded. Richards converted successfully so the match ended in a Wigan 18-28 victory.\nPost-match.\nThe Wigan Warriors had won the Challenge Cup for a record eighteenth time. The Lance Todd Trophy for man-of-the-match was awarded to Wigan prop forward Jeff Lima, who had scored two tries, becoming the fifth New Zealander (and first prop forward since 1980) to win the award. Later, the Rugby Football League found Wigan fullback Sam Tomkins guilty of minor misconduct for an abusive gesture to Leeds fans during the match and fined him £1,000."
