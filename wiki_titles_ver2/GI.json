Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Wolf Pack represent the University of Nevada, Reno in the NCAA's Mountain West Conference.\nNevada began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1912. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Nevada's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

They were coached by 41st-year head coach, Mike Krzyzewski. The Blue Devils played their home games at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina, as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nKnown for consistent high-level performance under Krzyzewski's tenure, the Blue Devils struggled to match their norm this season. Duke fell out of the AP and Coaches Poll rankings within the first few weeks and struggled to maintain a winning record. The Blue Devils finished the 2020–21 season 13–11, and 9–9 to finish in tenth place in ACC play. Duke spent much of the late season on the bubble, according to bracketologists, and ultimately their season ended when a positive COVID-19 test forced them to drop out of the ACC tournament ahead of the quarterfinals. Duke missed the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1995.\nPrevious season.\nThe Blue Devils finished the 2019–20 season 25–6, and 15–5 to finish in a tie for second place in ACC play.

On September 16, 2020, the NCAA announced that November 25 would be the new start date. Matchups for ACC–Big Ten Challenge were released on October 30. The Champions Classic, which was originally to be held on November 10, was later moved to December 1 and was to be held in Orlando. However, due to disagreements between ESPN, who was staging the event (and others), over health and safety protocols related to COVID-19, the event was canceled. It was hoped that the event could be still held elsewhere. It was later reported that the Blue Devils would play their Champions Classic game at Duke while Kentucky and Kansas will play in Indianapolis due to conflicting COVID-19 protocols by the respective schools.\nPrior to the start of the season, it was announced that Duke would not play its scheduled season opener against Gardner–Webb, which had a positive coronavirus test within its team. On December 10, 2020, the school announced that it would cancel the remaining non-conference games, meaning games already postponed would not be made up.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| ACC Tournament\nSource\nRankings.\nOn January 18, 2021, Duke fell out of the AP Top 25 ranking for the first time since February 8, 2016.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Tigers represent Clemson University in the NCAA's Atlantic Coast Conference.\nClemson began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1911. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Clemson's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

A luge is a small one- or two-person sled on which one sleds supine (face up) and feet-first. A luger steers by using the calf muscles to flex the sled's runners or by exerting opposite shoulder pressure to the seat.\nHistory.\nThis event has been annual from December to February since winter 2014/2015. The overall winners in the disciplines single-seater women, single-seater men and double-seaterare determined for the junior and youth classes. Both men and women can compete in the double-seater, but the participants are almost exclusively men. All athletes with a valid FIL license who are at least 15 years old and not yet 21 years old in the year in which the season ends, are eligible to participate. A maximum of six women in single-seaters, six men in single-seaters and three pairs of two-seaters can participate in a World Cup race per national association.\nThe result of a World Cup race is determined by the sum of the times achieved in two rounds. In exceptional weather or track conditions, the race can also be decided in a single pass. The starting order in the first run is determined by the progress in the World Cup ranking. The World Cup leader starts last and the athletes with the fewest or no World Cup points start first. The overall result of the previous year is decisive in the first season race. The second round starts after the fallen classification of the first run, so the halftime leader starts last. Before each scoring round, at least one forerunner must be on the track.\nAwarding of points and overall rating.\nFor each World Cup race, World Cup points are awarded according to the FIL point scheme. The winner receives 100 points, the second place 85 points, the third place 70 points and the further ranks fewer and fewer points, up to place 39, for which two points are awarded. All athletes from 40th place receive a World Cup point."

He was a standout college player for the University of South Florida (USF), where he was the 1983 Sun Belt Conference co-Player of the Year and left as the school's all-time leading scorer and is considered the best player in school history.\nCollege career.\nBorn and raised in Tampa, Florida, Bradley starred at Thomas Richard Robinson High School before choosing hometown South Florida over several higher-profile suitors, including Florida, his other finalist. He joined the starting lineup midway through his freshman season, and as a sophomore became one of the top scorers in the country. Over the 1982–83 season, Bradley averaged 26.7 points per game to lead the Sun Belt Conference and rank fourth in the nation. He led the nation for 11 weeks his sophomore year. At the close of the year, he was named the Sun Belt co-Player of the Year (with Calvin Duncan of VCU) as well as an honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press (AP).\nBradley's scoring numbers dipped in his junior and senior seasons, though he still averaged 22.3 and 21.7 per game respectively. He was named first-team All-Sun Belt both years and repeated as an AP honorable mention All-American as a senior. Bradley left USF holding most of the school's scoring records, including the career points mark (2,319). He became the first player in USF history to have his jersey retired on February 14, 1987 and was an inaugural member of the USF Athletic Hall of Fame in 2009. He was named to the Sun Belt All-Decade team in 1986.\nProfessional career.\nFollowing the close of his college career, Bradley was selected by the Sacramento Kings in the third round (51st pick overall) of the 1985 NBA draft, but did not play in the National Basketball Association. He played internationally in Argentina, Spain and Venezuela before retiring from basketball in 1994. Bradley played the 1990–91 season for the Tulsa Fast Breakers of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), averaging 9.6 points and 3.9 rebounds over 40 games."

The Golden Eagles represent the University of Southern Mississippi in the NCAA Division I Sun Belt Conference.\nSouthern Miss began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1912. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Southern Miss's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Disc golf (in ) is a popular sport in Estonia, where it is played at the recreational, club, and international competition levels.\nDisc golf in Estonia is governed by the Estonian Disc Golf Association (EDGL, in ). Its mission is to promote disc golf as an exciting and accessible sport.\nPopularity.\nDisc golf is the fastest growing sport in Estonia. It has enjoyed an exponential surge in popularity since the early 2010s, quickly making Estonia a hotbed of the sport, together with Finland. In the PDGA's Year-End Demographic Report for 2019, Estonia had 930 active members, 135 courses, and organized 44 PDGA-sanctioned events. In June 2020, there were 864 active PDGA members and 628 expired memberships.\nThe surge in disc golf popularity in Estonia is generally attributed to its close proximity to disc golf hubs around the Baltic Sea, namely Finland and Sweden. Rene Mengel, Estonian disc golf pioneer and the country's main disc golf promoter, attributes the success of the sport to a large number of disc golf courses throughout the country, and to the fact that disc golf discs can be purchased from local retail stores in Estonia in addition to specialized online retailers, helping make the sport accessible.\nCourses.\nApproximately 2% of the world's disc golf courses are located in Estonia. Some of the most notable ones include Kõrvemaa, Jõulumäe, Alutaguse, Mäetaguse and Elva disc golf courses.\nMost popular courses in Estonia are Männiku Wakepark, Tartu Roosi, Kurna, Coolbet Järve and Discland disc golf courses, of which 4 (excluding Tartu Roosi) are inside or in close proximity of Estonia's capital, Tallinn \nIn 2019, Tallinn was rated #4 on UDisc's list of Top 5 Disc Golf Cities outside the United States.\nAs of May 2021 Estonia has 212 courses, Estonia has the highest density of disc golf courses per square kilometer of any country, and the second-highest number of disc golf courses per capita, after Iceland.\nDiscgolfi Rajad is a disc golf course directory exclusive to Estonia. It allows players to filter courses by one of Estonia's 15 counties (, plural \"\") and provides hole-by hole information in addition to maps.\nMarket.\nDisc Golf Metrix is a highly popular Estonian disc golf website. Between a third and half of its traffic originates from Estonia. It facilitates tournament management and allows players to keep track of their progress. In February 2020, the FFFD selected Disc Golf Metrix as its tournament management solution for the 2020 National Tour, the most prestigious tournament in France.\nManufacturers.\nFounded in 2017, Disctroyer is Estonia's first and only manufacturer of PDGA approved discs. Trindem OÜ manufactures the Discrait basket, which was certified by the PDGA at the Championship level in April 2017.\nTourism.\nEstonia is a popular destination among Finnish disc golf enthusiasts. Disc golf courses are marketed on Estonia's official tourist information website, and they are available as a map layer.\nNotable Estonian disc golfers.\nNotable disc golfers include Albert Tamm, Silver Lätt, and Estonia's top women's disc golfer Kristin Tattar, who was the first European to win the US Open, and the number 1 ranked female in the world as of May 2022."

On September 2, it was announced that the race would be held without spectators, and it was won by filly Swiss Skydiver in the second-fastest time ever.\nBackground.\nThis was the first time since the 1945 Triple Crown races were affected by World War II that the event took place outside of its regular May schedule. With the Belmont Stakes run on June 20 and the Kentucky Derby on September 5, the Preakness became the final leg of the 2020 Triple Crown. As different horses won the Belmont and the Kentucky Derby, it was established prior to the Preakness that there would be no Triple Crown winner in 2020.\nThe race provided the winner with a berth in the Breeders' Cup Classic, held a month later on November 7.\nPer a decision by the Maryland Jockey Club, \"Maryland, My Maryland\" was not played before the Preakness, as had been prior tradition—the song \"which celebrates the Confederacy, is considered by some to be racist\".\nField.\nOn September 22, the owners of Belmont Stakes winner Tiz the Law announced that he would not run in the Preakness.

It fields both men's and women's teams, the men compete in Division 1-A in the California conference and the women play in the Pacific Desert conference of Division II. The Aztec men's team won the US National Collegiate Rugby Championship in 1987.\nTeams.\nMen's team.\nSince the inception of the club in 1958, men's rugby has been both a popular and successful sport on campus at SDSU, so much so that Aztec alumni went on to set-up the rugby team of Old Mission Beach Athletic Club (OMBAC) in 1966 and also to found San Diego Old Aztecs RFC in 1978. In addition to the 1987 National Championship, the Aztecs have won numerous SCRFU Collegiate Conference titles to progress to the national playoffs, including 1996, 2007, 2008 (quarterfinalists), 2009 (semifinalists), 2010 (quarterfinalists) and 2012 (semifinalists). San Diego State men's teams have also excelled at the \"short-form\" of the game; finishing second at the 2010 Collegiate Rugby Championship (broadcast live on NBC) and qualifying to play in the USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships in 2011 (quarterfinalists), 2012 and 2015 (quarterfinalists).\nWomen's team.\nWomen first represented San Diego State at rugby in 1975 and, like the men, had an astonishingly successful introduction, finishing the season second in the nation after losing the inaugural Women's Collegiate National Championship to the University of Colorado. The team played successfully for eleven seasons, even going on an undefeated four-match tour of New Zealand in 1981. In 1986 the Aztecs combined with a local club team the Rio Grande Surfers. The Surfers, now known as the San Diego Surfers, play in the Women's Premier League, the highest level of women's rugby in the United States. The Aztec women's team has recently been re-established on campus and they were progressing through the 2020 season until it was cut-short by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nClub history.\nFounding and inaugural season.\nThe first record of anyone having an interest in playing rugby at San Diego State College (as it was then) is an advertisement in the school newspaper, The Daily Aztec, at the end of the fall semester of 1957 asking for \"Men interested in forming a rugby team\" to attend a meeting. More than 45 people turned up so a season schedule was put together along with a timetable of practices to be held over the winter break and Mr. Fred Quiett of the university's Engineering Department agreed to become the club's first faculty representative.\nThe team played its first competitive matches in the spring semester at the Southern California Rugby Football Union Carnival in Santa Ana on Sunday February 9, 1958, defeating Pomona-Claremont 8–0 and losing to the Pepperdine College Waves 3–8. The first of seven league matches that season was played against El Centro in El Centro on Saturday February 15, the Aztecs won 15–0. Their next match was their first at home, it was played in the Aztec Bowl (now the site of the Viejas Arena) against Ontario and was won by the Aztecs 20–14.\nWinning ways continued that first \"Cinderella season\" with a further three victories before suffering their first league defeat to Eagle Rock Athletic Club. This set-up their final match with Santa Ana College on the next weekend as a championship decider, the Aztecs won the match and thus they also clinched the league in their inaugural season. Four of the team were named on the Southern California All star team (Bob Johnston, Ernie Trumper, Jim Hansen and Ian Richardson), two to the All-star second team (Bob Shank and Jim Hastings) and one honorable-mention (Ray Fackrell).\nNational championship.\nThe Aztecs won the US National Men's Collegiate Rugby Championship in 1987, overcoming Dartmouth College rugby club 22–6 in the semifinals and beating the United States Air Force Academy rugby club 10–9 in the final.

She also competed at the 1976 Summer Olympics and the 1988 Summer Olympics.\nBiography.\nMason was born in Knowle, in the West Midlands in 1933. She started to ride horses from a young age and got her first horse when she was seventeen years old. In 1954, Mason became the first woman to be selected for the British three day eventing team. In the same year, she won gold at the European Eventing Championships.\nMason competed at two Olympic Games. At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, she competed in the individual and team dressage events, finishing in 25th and 8th places respectively.

        "text": "The individual show jumping at the 1976 Summer Olympics took place on 27 July. The event was open to men and women. The individual show jumping event consisted of two rounds, held separately from the team competition. The top 20 riders from the first round qualified for the second round, both rounds were then combined to determine placement, if tied a jump-off between all tied riders would determine the winners. There were 47 competitors from 20 nations. The event was won by Alwin Schockemöhle of West Germany, the nation's first medal in individual jumping as a separate team (both Germany and the United Team of Germany had won a gold medal before). Canada also earned its first medal in the event, with Michel Vaillancourt's silver. François Mathy's bronze was Belgium's first medal in the event since 1912. Great Britain's podium streak in individual jumping ended at four Games, as Debbie Johnsey took fourth after reaching a three-way jump-off against Vaillancourt and Mathy but coming last out of the jump-off.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900. The team and individual events remained separated, as they had been starting in 1968.\nFive of the top 10 (top 12, after ties) riders from the 1972 competition returned: gold medalist Graziano Mancinelli of Italy, fourth-place finishers Jim Day of Canada and Hugo Simon of Austria, seventh-place finisher Jean-Marcel Rozier of France, and eighth-place finisher Alfonso Segovia of Spain. Also returning were the brothers Piero D'Inzeo and Raimondo D'Inzeo. Raimondo had won the 1960 gold and 1956 silver medals; Piero had won the 1960 silver and 1956 bronze medals. The brothers were competing in their eighth (and final) Olympics, the first people to appear in eight Games. The 1956 gold medalist Hans Günter Winkler of West Germany was also competing again after not participating in 1972. Hartwig Steenken, also of West Germany, was the reigning World Champion but did not compete in Montreal.\nGuatemala and Puerto Rico each made their debut in the event. France competed for the 14th time, most of any nation, having missed the individual jumping only in 1932.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used the two-round format introduced in 1952, with the elimination feature added in 1968. The top 20 riders from the first round qualified for the second round, both rounds were then combined to determine placement, if tied a jump-off between all tied riders would determine the winners.\nResults.\nSchockemöhle was the first rider to achieve a clean run in both rounds since the competition moved to the two-round format in 1952."

The Redbirds represent Illinois State University in the NCAA's Missouri Valley Conference.\nIllinois State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1898. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Illinois State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

        "text": "The individual show jumping at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place on 12 August at the Santa Anita Racetrack. The event was open to both men and women. There were 51 competitors from 21 nations. The event was won by Joseph Fargis of the United States, the nation's first victory in individual jumping since 1968 and second overall, third-most all-time behind France and Italy with 3. His teammate Conrad Homfeld earned silver. Heidi Robbiani earned Switzerland's first medal in the event since 1928 with her bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 17th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900. The team and individual events remained separated, as they had been starting in 1968.\nDue to the American-led boycott in 1980 and the Soviet-led boycott in 1984, only fourth-place finisher Oswaldo Méndez of Guatemala returned from the 1980 Games. The favorite was 1982 World Cup winner Melanie Smith, leading an unusually strong American team.\nNo nations made their debut in the event. France competed for the 15th time, most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used the two-round format introduced in 1952. The elimination feature added in 1968 returned after not being used in 1980 due to a small field; the number of riders advancing from the first round to the second was increased to 25 from 20 (the number of advancing riders in 1972 and 1976). Both rounds were combined to determine placement. Ties for medal positions would be broken through a jump-off."

The Yellow Jackets represent the Georgia Institute of Technology in the NCAA's Atlantic Coast Conference.\nGeorgia Tech began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1905. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Georgia Tech's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "ABC was the first American television network to broadcast the Pan American Games in 1963, when they devoted one episode of their \"Wide World of Sports\" anthology program to the games. They doubled their coverage to two episodes of the show in 1967. CBS then bought the rights to the 1975 and 1979 Games at the same time. Their coverage in 1975 was mainly shown on \"CBS Sports Spectacular\", their equivalent to \"Wide World of Sports\". CBS repeated the process of airing most of its coverage on \"CBS Sports Spectacular\" in 1979.\nFor the 1983 games, CBS aired all of its coverage on weekend afternoons. These games also marked the first of three consecutive hosting assignments of Brent Musburger. CBS endured numerous obstacles in the run up to the games, including missing video tape machines and mobile units, inexperienced technicians from several countries, a last minute disagreement with the host broadcaster that left CBS scrambling to add 5 more cameras to the 3 it planned to use at the opening ceremony, and more. In addition, when a large doping scandal broke out at the games, including the sudden departure of 12 American athletes to avoid drug testing, Musburger made special reports on the scandal during the \"CBS Morning News\" and \"CBS Evening News\", as well as during the regularly scheduled coverage.\nCBS broadcast its fourth consecutive Pan American Games in 1987 and provided the host feed as well. This would be the last time that CBS would broadcast the games. Brent Musburger as previously alluded to, returned as host.\nIn 1991, ABC sought the rights to the Pan Am Games in Havana. The negotiations became bogged down in the U.S. embargo against Cuba, which forbade direct payments to Cuba. After a protracted negotiation with the U.S. Justice Department, ABC eventually signed a deal to broadcast the games. The fee was paid indirectly to avoid the embargo. ABC partnered with Ted Turner's TNT cable channel for the Havana games. TNT aired the prime time coverage with Ernie Johnson Jr. as host, while Brent Musburger (who had been fired by CBS in March 1990) anchored ABC's weekend afternoon coverage. This would be the last time the games were broadcast by a major broadcast network in the United States. All coverage since has aired on cable or Spanish-language networks.\nSince 1995.\nNo major U.S. networks covered the 1999 Pan Am Games from Winnipeg, Canada, except for the Spanish-language network Univisión, while newspapers only sent second-string reporters instead and the stories never made front page news. Winnipeg mayor Glen Murray became nationally well known as a result of the Games and thanks to extensive coverage by the CBC, anchored by CBC Sports' Brian Williams.\nIn the United States, ESPN and ESPN Deportes held the broadcasting rights for the Pan American Games through 2019.\n2015 Pam American Games.\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) served as the host and domestic broadcaster of the 2015 Pan American Games from Toronto; locally, coverage was broadcast in the English and French languages by CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada Télé, and CBC's website carried 650 hours of online coverage. Pay television rights were sub-licensed to Sportsnet, which aired the football (soccer) tournaments, and a semi-final of the Men's basketball tournament that involved Canada. Spanish language rights were sub-licensed to Telelatino and Univision Canada; the broadcaster collaborated with US Spanish-language rights-holder ESPN Deportes on its own coverage. CBC stated that it was \"very happy\" with the ratings performance of the Games; primetime coverage averaged around 900,000 to 1 million viewers per night, and the opening ceremonies were seen by 1.93 million viewers across CBC and CBC News Network, with the largest audience being in the Toronto region.\nIn the United States, ESPN held broadcast rights, with 66 hours of English-language coverage across ESPN and ESPN2, 44 hours on Longhorn Network, 200 hours of Spanish-language coverage on ESPN Deportes, and streaming on WatchESPN. ESPN broadcast from studios at Corus Quay, which was linked to the IBC (and in turn, ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut). ESPN and ESPN Deportes used their own hosts, as well of those of CBC, as part of its multi-platform coverage.\nRede Record acquired rights in Brazil, paying a record US$30 million. Other broadcasting deals include Torneos y Competencias sports in Argentina, Claro Sports in Mexico and Latina Televisión in Peru.\n2019 and 2023 Pan American Games.\nMediapro served as host broadcaster for the 2019 Pan American Games from Lima, Peru. The Lima Convention Centre hosted the International Broadcast Centre (IBC). Panam Sports also launched the \"Panam Sports Channel\" on its website, which featured supplemental video content from the Games hosted by local personality Alexandra Hörler.\nIn February 2022, Mediapro reached an agreement to serve as host broadcaster of Santiago 2023; for the first time, every event held across the Pan-American and Parapan American Games will be televised, nearly doubling the hours of coverage that will be available to rightsholders in comparison to 2019. In September 2022, the country's public broadcaster Televisión Nacional de Chile (TVN) reached an agreement to serve as the domestic broadcaster of the Games. In early-2023, the commercial networks Canal 13 and Chilevisión also acquired rights to the Games."

        "text": "The Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball program in various categories, including points, three-pointers, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Red Raiders represent Texas Tech University in the NCAA's Big 12 Conference.\nTexas Tech began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1925. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Texas Tech's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "Trinidad and Tobago v United States (2018 FIFA World Cup qualification)",
        "text": "On October 10, 2017, Trinidad and Tobago played against the United States at the Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva in what was the final 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match for both teams. Trinidad and Tobago won the match 2–1 which resulted in the United States missing their first World Cup since 1986, as well as Trinidad and Tobago's first win over the United States since 2008, and their third win against them in international association football.\nBackground.\nFollowing consecutive losses to Mexico and Costa Rica in the opening games of the final round of qualification in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Jürgen Klinsmann was fired from the United States men's national team job and replaced by former USMNT coach Bruce Arena. On his 3rd game back in charge, Arena coached the U.S. to a 6–0 victory over Honduras, and 4 days later got a 1–1 draw against Panama at Panama City. Three months after that, they beat Trinidad and Tobago 2–0 in Commerce City, Colorado, both goals coming from Christian Pulisic, giving the United States a total of 7 points in the qualification group standings. After earning only 2 points from their next three games, the United States hosted Panama and got a 4–0 victory before traveling to Trinidad and Tobago for the game.\nDespite their unremarkable play to that point, the United States entered their final WCQ match in excellent position to secure an eighth-consecutive World Cup appearance, and a seemingly impossible combination of results would have to occur to prevent this. With a win, the U.S. would mathematically guarantee qualification for the World Cup regardless of the outcome of the other two matches. A draw, likewise, would be enough to clinch a World Cup spot, barring an extraordinarily unlikely combination of scores from the other two matches: an 8-goal margin of victory for low-scoring Panama (against Costa Rica) \"and\" a 13-goal margin of victory for second-from-last Honduras (against undefeated Mexico).\nEven with a loss to the underdog Trinidadians, the Americans would still qualify with either a loss or a draw by both Panama and Honduras. Moreover, if one of these two teams were to win, the U.S. would remain in contention with a loss or a draw by the other; this latter scenario would lock the U.S. into fourth-place and force a two-legged tie with Australia, who had defeated Syria 3-2 on aggregate. In summary, there were 26 of 27 possible W-L-D combinations which would allow the USMNT to punch its ticket to Russia the following summer.\nTrinidad and Tobago, meanwhile, was already eliminated, and had almost nothing to play for besides revenge for Paul Caligiuri's infamous goal in 1989, which allowed the U.S. to qualify in Trinidad's place.\nBefore the match, the CONCACAF fifth round table was as follows:\nPre-match.\nThe match was played at the smaller Ato Boldon Stadium instead of Hasely Crawford Stadium due to the stadium's issues with its floodlights. Heavy rain in the days preceding the match meant that the field at Ato Boldon Stadium was soaked, impeding practice the day before the match on October 9.\nAs Trinidad and Tobago were already eliminated from advancement to the World Cup, they included a number of young and untested players in their starting lineup rather than their usual starters, a common practice.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nA cross from Alvin Jones in the 17th minute was dealt badly by Omar Gonzalez, resulting in an own goal for the United States. While Trinidad and Tobago had few reasonable chances in the first half, Alvin Jones doubled their lead nonetheless with a \"blistering 35-yard strike\". The U.S. managed to score a goal in the second half through Christian Pulisic and brought in new attacking players to increase their attacking opportunities, but the Soca Warriors held them back until the end of the game.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nResults.\nTo the surprise of many, both Central American underdogs, Panama and Honduras, won against Costa Rica and Mexico respectively. Panamanian forward Blas Pérez scored a controversial \"ghost goal\" in the 53rd minute to equalize the score 1–1, before Román Torres scored the winning goal in the 88th minute. Honduras also pulled a comeback in their win against Mexico. The Mexican team had a 2–1 lead at half-time before Eddie Hernández's shot bounced off of the crossbar and hit the back of Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa's head and went into the net, putting the score at 2–2. Seven minutes later, Romell Quioto scored the winning goal for Honduras, ending Mexico's chance to go unbeaten throughout the qualifying rounds. Because of the United States' loss and their win, Panama qualified automatically for the group stage of the 2018 competition, while Honduras advanced to the CONCACAF–AFC play-off matches against Australia.\nReactions.\nMedia.\nThe result and failure for the U.S. to qualify made national and international news overnight. ESPN FC hosted a segment on the game and openly criticized the \"arrogance\" that the United States team had. Alejandro Moreno criticized the players' commitment and passion for the game. Shaka Hislop, a former goalkeeper who represented Trinidad and Tobago in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, blamed the U.S. media for asking Arena about the performance of European players and other unrelated questions of the match the day before. Hislop also criticized the United States team for their criticism of the field conditions.\nTaylor Twellman went on an unscripted rant on ESPN in which he highlighted the lack of focus on the match at hand, claiming other players and broadcasters asked for the other scoreline from the other matches in qualifying. Twellman stated that the U.S. needs to revise everything about the United States Soccer Federation, including Major League Soccer, the \"pay to play\" system of U.S. youth soccer, and other aspects of the federation. He cited efforts by the German Football Association as an example of a nation that had successfully changed its culture after the national team's failure in Euro 2000 and Euro 2004. Twellman further added similar dissatisfaction with the pitch criticism, citing Bosnia and Herzegovina and Belgium playing against each other on what he termed a \"cow pasture\". Twellman also complained that Iceland qualified for the World Cup while the United States did not. The next day, he said the U.S. men's national team had an arrogance that he cannot understand and that soccer must not be the American way. That same day, Fox Sports' Alexi Lalas rued U.S. elimination as \"We have nobody to blame but ourselves.\"\nAn analysis by the sports side of the blog \"FiveThirtyEight\" called the match \"the worst loss in USMNT's history based on the Elo rating system\" since the USMNT was so heavily favored, which made the loss all the more stinging due to the high stakes involved. A retrospective by the sports blog SB Nation agreed, calling the match the worst in the U.S. men's team's history.\nSome news outlets and journalists described this American loss as a \"revenge\", particularly by pointing that the United States had prevented Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica, and Panama from qualifying to the 1990, 2010, and 2014 World Cups, respectively. Writing for \"Wired868\", Trinidadian journalist Lasana Liburd published a note titled \"Mr. Jones Stuns USA! American World Cup Dreams Drown in River of Tears at Couva\", where he mocked the U.S. by saying \"Make America Great Again? We'd rather not\" and that Kelvin Jones, who was an unused substitute during the United States' victory over Trinidad and Tobago in 1989, had his son Alvin ensuring \"that, for at least the next four years, the USA's Pulisic will now know how he felt.\" The \"Daily Express Susan Mohammed reported that Trinidadian politician and former CONCACAF president Jack Warner rejoiced on the U.S. elimination with phrases such as \"this is the happiest day of my life\", \"nobody in CONCACAF likes the US\", and that \"other teams within the CONCACAF sought to 'help one another' but the US team sought to 'embarrass them'.\" Praising Costa Rica's qualification to the World Cup, \"La Nacións Amado Hidalgo felt \"lurked\" by the memories of Jonathan Bornstein and Graham Zusi scoring last-minute goals that left Costa Rica and Panama out of the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, respectively, and expressed that \"maybe Trinidad avenged us all and buried the American dream of Bruce Arena and his legion.\" On Twitter, the Mexican version of ESPN suggested that Panama's qualification over the United States was \"a revenge\", given that a goal by an American player left Panama out of the 2014 World Cup much like a goal by a Panamanian player left the United States out of the 2018 World Cup. Spanish statistician and journalist mocked the United States by telling Graham Zusi \"you are going to watch [the 2018 World Cup] on television.\"\nIn the years following the match, U.S. fans and media have used the metonym \"Couva\" to refer to their infamous defeat and subsequent failure to qualify for the World Cup.\nUnited States national team.\nBruce Arena resigned as the head coach of the team shortly after the match. Omar Gonzalez in a post-match press conference stated his own goal \"is one that will haunt me forever.\"\nFollowing a year-long stint by Dave Sarachan as interim head coach, Gregg Berhalter was hired to coach the U.S. through the 2022 World Cup. Former regulars such as Howard, Dempsey, Altidore, and Bradley retired or were phased out of the team and were replaced by young players such as Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, and Sergiño Dest who helped to guide the U.S. back to the top of CONCACAF and ultimately towards qualification for the following World Cup in 2022.\nRematches.\nThe two teams met for the first time since the \"Soca Warriors\" eliminated the U.S. on June 22, 2019 in the CONCACAF Gold Cup group stage. This time, the U.S. handily won the match 6–0. Following 3 more matches in the U.S. which the \"Stars and Stripes\" won, outscoring Trinidad and Tobago 16–0 in the process, the two sides met in Trinidad for the first time since their 2017 encounter, this time at Hasely Crawford Stadium in Port of Spain, for the second leg of the 2023–24 CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinals on November 20, 2023. Once again, Trinidad and Tobago defeated the United States by an identical 2–1 score, with Alvin Jones scoring another goal from well outside the box. Despite the loss, the U.S. still advanced to the Finals and 2024 Copa America, for which they will host, as they had won the first leg 3–0, securing a 4–2 aggregate victory."

It was canceled on April 30, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCancellation.\nTalks of cancellation or postponement began in early March as professional sports leagues such as the NBA, NHL, MLB, MLR, and MLS suspended their seasons. In an April 15 interview with the Associated Press, Little League president and CEO Stephen Keener spoke on the challenging decision in regards to the World Series and coronavirus. One of the most prominent resolutions to the situation would be moving the World Series back and playing later in the fall, possibly late September, October or even November. However, Keener negated that idea:\nOn April 30, 2020, Little League Baseball announced the cancellation of the 2020 World Series and its regional tournaments for baseball and softball.\nLittle League said in a press release:\nLittle League's president and CEO said in the release:\n2020 MLB Little League Classic.\nThe 2020 edition of the MLB Little League Classic game at Williamsport's BB&amp;T Ballpark at Historic Bowman Field was to feature the Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles in the first American League matchup for the event on August 23; it was also cancelled on April 30, 2020."

        "title": "Equestrian Statue of Leopold II, Ostend",
        "text": "The Equestrian Statue of Leopold II () is a monument erected in Ostend, Belgium, in memory of King Leopold II, second King of the Belgians. It is located on the Royal Galleries by the beach. The king was commemorated here as a benefactor of Ostend and the Belgian Congo. The inauguration was on 19 July 1931.\nPartly due to Leopold II's colonial regime, the monument is the subject of ongoing controversy and has been vandalised several times.\nHistory.\nDuring King Leopold II's reign, Thomas Vinçotte produced a portrait bust of the king, which is now in the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken. Shortly after the king's death in 1909, plans started to honour him, as a benefactor of Ostend and the Belgian Congo.\nAfter the First World War, the city government started work on plans for a statue. The sculptor Alfred Courtens was commissioned, together with his brother, the architect Antoine Courtens. The City Council may have hoped to regain the dynasty as summer residents but after Leopold II's death, Ostend's status as a royal summer residence quickly crumbled. On 22 September 1981, the statue was declared a protected monument.\nDescription.\nThe Equestrian Statue of Leopold II is known locally as \"De Drie Gapers\" (\"The Three Gaps\"). The middle of the three passages was made on the sea side.\nThe monument has an important architectural part that roughly consists of a voluminous upright column, with two horizontal bases on the left and right. This gives a form of a kind of double \"L\" monogram (two \"L\"'s turned away from each other), the monogram that Leopold II often used. On top in bronze, Leopold II sits in military uniform on horseback looking over the North Sea.\nAt the bottom left a larger than life sculptural group, also in bronze, depicting \"Gratitude of the Congolese to Leopold II for freeing them from slavery among the Arabs\". On the right, a pendant, depicting \"Tribute of the Ostend fishing population\".\nControversy.\nCongo Free State.\nLeopold was the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State; a private project was undertaken on his behalf. He used the explorer Henry Morton Stanley to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the Berlin Conference of 1884–85, the colonial nations of Europe authorised his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improve the lives of the native inhabitants.\nFrom the beginning, Leopold ignored these conditions and millions of Congolese inhabitants, including children, were mutilated and killed. He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death.\nLeopold extracted a fortune from the Congo, initially by the collection of ivory, and after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s, by forced labour from the natives to harvest and process rubber. Under his regime, millions of Congolese people died.\nReports of deaths and abuse led to a major international scandal in the early 20th century, and Leopold was forced by the Belgian government to relinquish control of the colony to the civil administration in 1908.\nVandalism.\nThe monument has been vandalised in 2004 and 2020. In 2004, an activist group, \"De Stoete Ostendenoare\", symbolically cut off a bronze hand from one of the kneeling Congolese slaves who, as part of the \"Gratitude of the Congolese\" group in the monument, honours Leopold II. This was a reference to how Congolese slaves' hands were cut off if they did not produce enough rubber during Leopold's colonial regime. The activists were willing to give the hand back if a historically correct sign would be placed near the statue.\nThe statue was vandalised again in 2020 as part of the global Black Lives Matter movement after the murder of George Floyd. A petition to remove such statues was started to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Congo's independence from Belgium on 30 June 2020. On 9 June 2020, Ostend mayor Bart Tommelein said that the city council \"takes the fight against racism very seriously\" but \"replacing or removing statues will not happen\"."

Zimpher said that the Bearcat program under Huggins didn't fit with her plan to upgrade UC's academic reputation.

The Dukes represent Duquesne University in the NCAA's Atlantic 10 Conference.\nDuquesne began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1913. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Duquesne's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

        "text": "The UCF Knights men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the UCF Knights men's basketball program in various categories, including points, three-pointers, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Knights represent the University of Central Florida in the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference.\nUCF began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1969, initially as a club sport before upgrading to full varsity status in 1970–71. The Knights began their varsity existence as NCAA College Division members. When the NCAA split the College Division in 1973, creating today's Divisions II and III, UCF became a Division II member. The Knights did not move to D-I until the 1984–85 season. By that time, the NCAA had resumed officially recording assists as a statistic in Division I; after recording that statistic for two seasons in the early 1950s, it stopped doing so until 1983–84. Blocks and steals were not officially recorded in D-I until the 1985–86 season. UCF's record books cover the entire history of UCF men's basketball, even in seasons in which the NCAA did not officially record the relevant statistics. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Following this, he applied to the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association for accreditation as an amateur player. As a result, the chairman of the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association warned that any amateur player that played against Roy would thus forfeit their amateur accreditation. However, since Roy had played one game with the senior amateur team Quebec Sons of Ireland, all players on both sides were suspended from amateur play. A few days later, on January 13, it was determined that Roy was forbidden from ever playing amateur hockey."

This allowed many universities to begin restarting their athletic programs. Yale was one of the few teams to have officially existed during the war but, despite that advantage, the Elis still had a great deal of difficulty in the spring semester. The agreement with the New Haven Arena had ended and the Bulldogs no longer had a permanent home. Additionally, many schools were not ready to field teams until February at the earliest, and even then only a few games were scheduled for most programs.\nAs a consequence, Yale played just two games during the season. They were, however, against the Elis' two biggest rivals at the time, providing some measure of normalcy for the student body.\nWith so few games, the team did not employ a coach for the season. As of 2020 this is the final season in which the Bulldogs did not have an official head coach. E. Harvey Cushing served as team manager instead.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Cardinal represent Stanford University in the NCAA Division I Atlantic Coast Conference.\nStanford began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1913. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Stanford's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

It is often played on public residential roads or at schools, community centres and recreational areas around the island where most road tennis courts are located, either on asphalt or concrete pavement surfaces.\nEquipment.\nThe game is played using two wooden rackets and one tennis ball with the fur removed.\nAn eight-inch-high plank wood net is used on the court or road, which requires 21x10 feet of space to play.\nRules.\nThe first player to 21 points is declared the winner. There are no volleys in the game and the server alternates after five points have been scored. Similar to table tennis, each serve must bounce once in the server's court.\nSome popular competitions include Monarch of the Court in Barbados. The governance for the sport is the Professional Road Tennis Association.\nChampions\nThe player with the most attained tournament wins is Julian “Michael Jackson” White, other known as \"The World Boss\"."

He was the 121st President of the Scottish Rugby Union.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nStevenson started with Rutherglen.\nHe played for Cambuslang.\nHe then played for Dalziel.\nAdministrative career.\nHe has represented both Glasgow District and Lanarkshire.\nHe was a president of Cambuslang.\nStevenson became the 121st President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He served two years from 2008 to 2010.\nStevenson had tried to be President the year before, running against George Jack and Peter Brown in the first ever three way vote for the presidency. Stevenson lost out to Jack in the final round of voting; by 91 votes to 75 votes.\nJack then decided to put himself forward for another year as president. Stevenson decided to run again for the top post. One of Jack's aims for another year was to scrap the Scottish Cup. Stevenson was dead against this and argued that the Scottish Cup was a highlight of the club season. A number of clubs were opposed to Jack's idea and backed Stevenson. Stevenson won the vote by 95 votes to 86; and thus became president.\nStevenson decided to run again and go for his second year as president in 2009. This time he was up against the former Scotland captain Finlay Calder and Jim Gracie of Alloa. In the first round Calder secured 82 votes, Stevenson 81 votes and Gracie 16 votes. This meant for the second and final round of voting that Gracie dropped out. The final vote was Stevenson 92 votes and Calder 87 votes; and Stevenson remained president for the subsequent year.\nStevenson said:\n\"I’m just delighted. I never expected it to be anything other than very, very close. Finlay Calder is an iconic figure within Scottish Rugby, while Jimmy Gracie is someone who’s worked hard behind the scenes for many years. To beat them is amazing. I lost on the first vote 82-81 to Finlay Calder. Jim Gracie dropped out and I then won on the second vote. It was the Midlands vote that came to me which swung it. I was delighted as I’d just arrived back in Scotland at 1.30pm on the Friday from the Lions tour in South Africa, went home, showered, and went through to Murrayfield. I’ve had messages of congratulations from all over Scotland, the rest of the UK, and some international messages, such as from Australia and South Africa. It’s been really, really wonderful, as all the grassroots clubs have voted for me and it’s really touching. Afterwards, I went back to Cambuslang to have a wee celebration with others at the club. Then, when I got home, had a wee shindig with my wife Ellen, son James and his girlfriend.”\nOutside of rugby union.\nFor many years he worked for with Glasgow City Council.\nStevenson is a manager of Walkerweld Engineering of Cambuslang."

        "text": "A statue of Caesar Rodney was installed in Wilmington, Delaware, United States. The statue was erected in Rodney Square in downtown Wilmington on July 4, 1923. It was designed by New York sculptor James Edward Kelly. The Gorham Company in Rhode Island cast the statue and its two bronze plaques. The memorial was removed in June 2020. It is currently being stored in New Castle, Delaware in a private storage facility. Its plans for future display are currently unclear, and its removal has generated controversy.\nDescription.\nBronze plaques are affixed to the northwest and southeast sides of the statue's pedestal. One depicts Thomas McKean greeting Rodney in Philadelphia; the other, Rodney casting the deciding vote in favor of American independence. On top of the pedestal Rodney sits astride his horse, which is in full gallop with its front feet in the air, the majority of the statue's weight on the horse's hind legs. To balance the statue, Kelly heavily weighted the horse's tail and positioned Rodney upright and toward the rear of the horse.\nHistory.\nFunds for the statue were raised by the Caesar Rodney Equestrian Statue Executive Committee to commemorate the ride of Rodney from Kent County, Delaware to Independence Hall in Philadelphia on July 1 and 2, 1776.\nIt was removed from public display on June 12, 2020, along with the statue of Christopher Columbus in Wilmington, Delaware in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd. Both statues were temporarily removed after a Dover, Delaware statue honoring law enforcement was vandalized with an axe and urine-soaked Delaware state flags."

The event is recognised as the 1998 edition of the World Women's Snooker Championship first held in 1976. Kelly Fisher defeated Karen Corr 5–0 in the final to win the title.\nThe rounds leading up to the final were played at Radion Plaza, Sheffield, with the final played at the Crucible Theatre on a Sunday morning during the 1998 World Snooker Championship. Eight qualifying groups produced sixteen qualifiers who each faced one of the top sixteen seeds in the last 32 round. Defending champion Corr had won nine of the preceding events on the women's snooker circuit and had not lost to Fisher for 14 months before this tournament. However, Fisher took the title by whitewashing Corr in a rematch of the previous year's final. The highest break of the competition was 95, compiled by Kim Shaw in the last 32 round."

There is no bidding process per site: the league selects a potential venue unilaterally, the chosen team puts together a hosting proposal, and then the league owners vote to determine whether it is acceptable.\nOn May 18, 2023, it was reported that Levi's Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers, was considered the front-runner for the Super Bowl LX site. On May 22, the NFL announced that Super Bowl LX will be played at Levi's Stadium.\nBroadcasting.\nUnited States.\nTelevision.\nSuper Bowl LX is scheduled to be televised by NBC as part of the 11-year NFL television contract, which allows a four-year rotation between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ABC/ESPN. Under this rotation, NBC has the Super Bowl during the same years it has its Winter Olympics coverage. Super Bowl LX will be the second time after Super Bowl LVI that the game is scheduled on a date that falls within the date range of an ongoing Olympics event (and the third that the date will be on an Olympic year), the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\nIt is expected that a Spanish-language feed will air on one of NBC's sister networks, either Telemundo or Universo.\nStreaming.\nThe game is planned to be streamed live on Peacock, as well as NFL+ via mobile devices.\nRadio.\nWestwood One holds the national radio rights to the game."

He played college football at LSU and was a part of their national championship win in 2020. In college he played wide receiver. He was drafted by the Seahawks in the seventh round of the 2020 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nSullivan spent his childhood in Irving, Texas, where he lived in extreme poverty and at times experienced homelessness. His youth football coach offered to let Sullivan live with him. While Sullivan originally planned on attending Nimitz High School, he opted to move to Donaldsonville, Louisiana and stay with family and enroll at Donaldsonville High School. He eventually moved out of his aunt's house and stayed with the family of a teammate. Sullivan excelled in football at Donaldsonville and caught 57 passes for 987 yards and 11 touchdowns as a junior. As a senior, he was named first-team All-State after finishing the year with 57 receptions for 1,159 yards. Sullivan was rated a four-star recruit and committed to play college football at LSU over offers from TCU and Mississippi State.\nCollege career.\nSullivan spent his first two seasons playing special teams and was used on offense primarily as a blocking receiver. As a sophomore, he had 11 receptions for 219 yards and a touchdown while also rushing twice for five yards and a touchdown. LSU's coaching staff worked out Sullivan at tight end going into his junior season before ultimately moving him back to receiver. As a junior, he finished second on the team with 23 receptions and 363 receiving yards and scored two touchdowns. Sullivan spent most of his senior season as the Tigers' second tight end, catching 12 passes for 130 yards as the Tigers won the 2020 National Championship.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nSullivan was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the seventh round with the 251st overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. He was waived on September 5, 2020, and signed to the practice squad the next day. While on the practice squad, the Seahawks listed Sullivan as a defensive end as well as tight end after he began practicing at both positions. He was elevated to the active roster on October 31 for the team's week 8 game against the San Francisco 49ers, and reverted to the practice squad after the game. He was placed on the practice squad/injured list on November 23, 2020. His practice squad contract with the team expired after the season on January 18, 2021.\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn February 3, 2021, Sullivan signed a reserve/futures contract with the Carolina Panthers. He was waived on August 31, 2021, and re-signed to the practice squad the next day. On January 8, 2022, Sullivan was promoted to the active roster ahead of the week 17 matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nIn 2022, Sullivan played in 14 games for Carolina, recording two receptions for 46 yards. On January 9, 2023, Sullivan signed a futures/reserve contract with the Panthers.\nOn August 31, 2023, Sullivan was placed on injured reserve. He was activated on October 14.\nOn January 8, 2024, the Panthers signed Sullivan to a one-year contract extension."

        "title": "Snooker Scene",
        "text": "Snooker Scene is a monthly magazine about snooker and other cue sports. It was established by Clive Everton in 1972 from the amalgamation of the Billiards and Snooker Control Council's \"Billiards and Snooker\" and his own \"World Snooker\". Everton was editor until he retired in September 2022; the following month, it was announced that the magazine would be returning under new owners, Curtis Sport.\nHistory.\nEverton had been the editor of \"Billiards and Snooker\" from the December 1966 issue until the February 1971 issue when he was succeeded by Doug Organ. According to Everton, he was sacked at the instigation of Jack Karnehm, the Chairman of the Billiards and Snooker Control Council (as the Billiards Association and Control Council had renamed itself) for \"giving professionals publicity\" by including picture of four professional players on the cover of \"Billiards and Snooker\" at a time when the Billiards and Snooker Control Council and the professional players were in dispute over the World Billiards Championship. This dispute led to the Professional Billiards Players Association renaming itself as the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) and splitting from the Billiards and Snooker Control Council (B&amp;SCC). Following his sacking, Everton established his own magazine, \"World Snooker\", which printed and sold 3,000 copies of its first issue published in January 1971.\nIn 1972, the B&amp;SCC approached Everton to take over \"Billiards and Snooker\" and paid him £1,000 to do so. Everton merged \"Billiards and Snooker\" and \"World Snooker\" into\n\"Snooker Scene\", which published its first issue in April 1972, priced at 12p and featuring a report on the 1972 World Snooker Championship.\nThe magazine has sometimes featured criticisms of the WPBSA which have led to legal disputes.\n\"Snooker Scene\" was originally published by Everton's News Agency before being published by Snooker Scene Ltd. The magazine purchased and absorbed two other periodicals. \"Cue World\" was acquired in 1989, and \"Pot Black\" was purchased from the WPBSA in 1999. Janice Hale who joined Everton's News Agency in 1972 served as assistant editor, before leaving in 1992. Later, under Everton's editorship, the Deputy Editor was David Hendon, and the Chief Reporter was Phil Yates, and additional reporting was provided by Marcus Stead. The magazine was based at Halesowen for 14 years before moving to Stourbridge in late 2020.\nEverton has said of \"Snooker Scene\": \"I had started this as a simple journal of record of what was happening on the table, but it became a crusading vehicle … Taking \"Wisden\" and \"Private Eye\" as our models we sometimes made our point through hard reporting, sometimes through satire.\"\nIn the September 2022 issue of \"Snooker Scene\", Everton announced that he would not be continuing as editor. In October 2022 it was announced that the magazine would be returning under new owners, Curtis Sport, and with a new editor, Nick Metcalfe. Metcalfe brought a number of writers into the team, including Phil Haigh, David Hendon, Michael McMullan and Annette Lord. Following editorial disagreements with Everton, who retains legal ownership of the magazine, Metcalfe was removed as editor in December 2022. Long-time contributor Marcus Stead was appointed as acting editor, and he took on the role on a permanent basis from January 2023. The other current writers are Phil Yates and Annette Lord."

        "title": "Johns Hopkins–Princeton lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Johns Hopkins–Princeton lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays and Princeton Tigers. The teams first met in 1890 but would not meet again until 1930, after which, it became an annual staple on the schedule. Part of the enmity in the rivalry stems from the two school's similarities in high-level academics and lacrosse prominence, along with competing for a similar body of applicants. Through much of the latter half of the 20th century, Hopkins would dominate the rivalry. The series would resume national importance in the 1990s with the return of Princeton to the game's elite; since 1990, the Tigers have won six national championships and the Jays have claimed two. With the 90th meeting occurring in 2020, Johns Hopkins leads the series 59–31.\nSeries history.\nEarly years (1930s to 1960s).\nWhile the series was first played in 1890, the teams would not meet for the second time until 1930, as Princeton dropped its team between 1890 and 1921. One of the most intriguing aspects of the early meetings were their influence on the distinctive black and blue colors of Hopkins. The school's original colors were black and gold, but Princeton's orange black uniforms made the two teams indistinguishable on the field, leading to the creation of Blue Jay blue.\nAfter three more games, the series became an annual affair in 1937; its only blip being the 1944 season. In the 1937 contest, Princeton would triumph 7–4, winning their third national championship. Continued meetings would have significant national implications, as the teams competed as historic powers. After 23 meetings, Hopkins lead the series by a narrow 12–11 margin. However, after Princeton's one goal victory in 1956, Hopkins would win nine consecutive games until the Tigers topped the Jays in 1966.\nHopkins dominance (1960s through 1980s).\nHopkins continued to play at a high level in the 1960s, while Princeton began a slow descent after their Ivy League conference championship in 1967. That season, Johns Hopkins routed the Tigers 12 to 2 in Baltimore, the first of 24 straight victories over Princeton. The Tigers would only come within five goals of the Blue Jays once. Simultaneously, Hopkins dominated the new NCAA Division I tournament, winning seven national championships and appearing in nine more Final Fours. In contrast, blue-blooded Princeton had yet to make its first appearance in the 1980s, while failing to win their first Ivy League title since 1967.\nNational prominence (1990s to present).\nAfter former Hobart Statesmen coach Jerry Schmidt did not succeed in returning the Tigers to their former glory, Bill Tierney was hired for the 1988 season. Despite a 2–13 record in his first season and a shutout loss to Hopkins, Tierney would breakthrough during his third year. The 1990 Tigers made their first NCAA appearance and end Hopkins' streak at 24 games, taking the postseason rematch in the tournament to advance to the quarterfinals. The following year, No. 5 Princeton would win for the second-straight year in Baltimore. In 1992, Hopkins would get revenge but Princeton would go on to win its first national title in 39 years.\nThe rivalry had regained its former prominence as the two teams, along with Syracuse and Virginia, would dominate the decade. Princeton would win five in this period, with Tierney grabbing a sixth in 2001. However, Hopkins would be unable to claim a title during the 1990s, their first decade without a championship since the 1880s. The rivalry was often played as the season opener for both teams during this period, described by Dave Pietramala as designed to \"find out where you stand\" and that \"Everyone wonders, Why do you play Princeton the first game of the year? That is crazy. But hey, it's just as difficult for them to play Hopkins the first game of the year.\"\nPrinceton gained the upper-hand, winning 8 of 12 meetings between the two perennial Top 5 programs in the 90s, including a second NCAA tournament showdown in 1994. The Tigers would win a tense overtime match by a score of 12 to 11, en route to a second national championship. That victory marked the first for the Tigers in Princeton in 28 years. In 2002, Princeton would again knock the Jays from the tournament, prevailing over No. 1 Hopkins in the Final Four. However, Pietramala would lead the Jays to its first two national championships since 1987 in the next few years. The series would be relatively even during this era, with the 2000s ending with a narrow 6–5 advantage for Hopkins.\nThe departure of Tierney in 2009 marked another shift in the rivalry. Since his exit to Denver, Princeton has only managed two NCAA appearances, with none since 2010. Across the field, Johns Hopkins missed the tournament for the first time since the inaugural edition in 2013, a year in which they lost to No. 12 Princeton in Baltimore. Hopkins would only make it to one Final Four during the 2015 season, the same year that the Jays joined the Big Ten Conference. Despite the new conference membership and increasing difficulty in non-conference scheduling, they have maintained the annual rivalry with the Tigers. As of 2020, the programs have split the last ten meetings.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "title": "List of British rugby league champions",
        "text": "The British men's rugby league champions are the winners of the highest league in British rugby league, which since 1996 is the Super League.\nNote that due to the varying inclusion and non-inclusion of a playoff system within the competition, the team that finished first in regular season have not always been champions. A list of first place finishes can be found at List of British rugby league league leaders. Since 2003, these teams have been awarded a separate trophy – the League Leaders' Shield.\nHistory.\nFollowing the schism in 1895 that saw 22 Northern rugby clubs split from the Rugby Football Union and form the Northern Union, the 22 clubs were organised into one league. At the end of the 1895–96 season, Manningham were the first club to be crowned champions, finishing one point ahead of Halifax.\nFollowing the success of the Northern Unions first season, more clubs defected from the Rugby Football Union to join the new league. After concerns around travel and costs were expressed, the decision was made that the competition should be split into two separate county championships: Lancashire and Yorkshire Leagues. County leagues were in place for the next five seasons until 1901–02 were the top seven sides from each league resigned to merge to form a new league. The only other times that there was no major championship was when there were outbrakes of war.\nDuring the late 1980s and early 90s, Wigan became the only full-time professional club and dominated in every competition. A new Super League began to be mooted during the Super League war in Australia as a way for Rupert Murdoch to gain an upper hand in broadcasting supremacy with the Australian Rugby League. British clubs were approached to form a Super League with a cash incentive. Part of the deal was switching the sport to summer and the merger of some clubs, the latter not taking place due to huge protest from fans. All four Super League champions; St Helens, Wigan, Bradford and Leeds have all previously won the old First Division.\nOnly three clubs to have been crowned champions are not in existence today. During the reclassification of the Championship in 1901, the league was split into two divisions. Manningham were placed in the Second Division, finishing 10th out of 18 teams. At the end of the season a series of meetings was held about establishing a Football League club in the city. During an annual meeting the committee voted to switch to association football, becoming Bradford City. A similar situation occurred at Bradford FC in 1907 when a narrow majority of members voted to withdraw from the Northern Union in favour of association football, forming Bradford Park Avenue. Broughton Rangers struggled post war and folded in 1955 after a failed name change to Belle Vue Rangers in 1946.\nHunslet FC were the fourth former champions to fold after financial issues , player strikes and a stadium fire that led to the club selling the land to developers before being eventually wound up. Unlike the other three clubs which no longer exist, a phoenix club, New Hunslet, was formed in 1973 and still exists.\nMethod of determining champion.\nThe method of determining the champions has changed multiple times between using the first past the post method of crowning league leaders champions or a play off series. A play off series was first used in 1906, this was due to some clubs playing more games than others and league positions being decided by win percentages rather than competition points.\nMost seasons have been decided by a play off format. Between 1973 and 1997 was the longest era where a first place league finish was used to decide the champions.\nTotal titles won.\nThere are 23 clubs who have won the British title, including 4 who have won the Super League (1996–present). The most recent to join the list were Featherstone Rovers in 1977–78.\nFour clubs have finished runners up without ever winning a Championship: Castleford Tigers (1938–39, 1968–69, 2017), Catalans Dragons (2021, 2023), London Broncos (1997) and the now defunct St Helens Recs (1926–27).\nTitle droughts.\nOf the 19 clubs to win the title who still exist Batley have the longest title drought having won their last title in . Of the current top flight teams Warrington are waiting the longest for their next title having last won it in .\nThe longest gap between titles was Leigh who waited 76 years between 1906 and 1982.\nThe longest wait for a first title was by Featherstone Rovers was waited 76 years between their first season in 1921 and their title winning season in 1977."

        "title": "2020–21 Munster Rugby season",
        "text": "The 2020–21 Munster Rugby season was Munster's twentieth season competing in the Pro14, alongside which they also competed in the European Rugby Champions Cup. It was Johann van Graan's fourth season as head coach.\nEvents.\nAs in the 2019–20 Pro14 season, Munster spent the 2020–21 Pro14 season in Conference B, alongside Benetton, Cardiff Blues, Connacht, Edinburgh and Scarlets South African side the Southern Kings were scheduled to participate in the conference, but they declared their withdrawal from rugby for the remainder of 2020 due to financial difficulties and travel restrictions enforced by the South African government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, before the South African Rugby Union board placed the club into voluntary liquidation in September 2020.\nDue to the mid-season break during the 2019–20 season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020–21 season started later than usual. The EPCR agreed a new format for the 2020–21 European Rugby Champions Cup in response to COVID-19: the top eight eligible teams from the Pro14, the Gallagher Premiership and Top 14 competed in a 24-team tournament divided into two pools of twelve teams, with each team playing four games in the pool stage - two at home and two away.\nAhead of the season, there were no changes to Munster's coaching stuff, though CEO Ian Flanagan told journalists that, while it isn't a priority, the search for a fifth coach to join the team remained active. Head of athletic performance Denis Logan returned home to the United States with his family at the end of October 2020, with Ged McNamara, previously the lead athletic development coach for Munster's academy, promoted to replace Logan. Elite player development manager Peter Malone left his academy role with the province in early 2021, and former Munster player Andi Kyriacou returned to the province as an elite player development officer in April 2021.\nThe big news in terms of player movements was the arrival of two of South Africa's 2019 Rugby World Cup-winning squad - centre Damian de Allende and lock RG Snyman. Irish-qualified fullback Matt Gallagher arrived from English club Saracens, while Hawaii-born prop Roman Salanoa made the move south from Leinster. Five academy players also graduated to the senior squad: prop Keynan Knox, hooker Diarmuid Barron, back-rower Jack O'Sullivan, centre Alex McHenry and winger Liam Coombes.\nTwo players - fly-half Tyler Bleyendaal and prop Brian Scott - were forced to retire from rugby due to injury during the 2019–20 mid-season break, whilst prop Ciaran Parker, locks Darren O'Shea and Seán O'Connor, back-rowers Arno Botha and Conor Oliver and centre Sammy Arnold departed the province for new clubs. Winger Alex Wootton also left the province on loan to Connacht for the 2020–21 season.\nOn the academy front, three players joined year one of the programme: hooker Scott Buckley, back-rower Alex Kendellen and fly-half Jack Crowley. Jack Stafford and Alan Tynan completed their three years in the academy and were released by the province. Lock Cian Hurley and winger Conor Phillips joined the academy in April 2021, whilst hooker Eoghan Clarke left to join English club Jersey Reds.\nMunster opened their 2020–21 Pro14 season with a 30–27 away win against Scarlets on 3 October 2020. Despite nine penalties from Scarlets fullback Leigh Halfpenny and a red card for captain Peter O'Mahony, tries from Jack O'Donoghue and Chris Farrell kept Munster within touching distance of the hosts, and a try from replacement hooker Kevin O'Byrne, converted by Ben Healy, levelled the score going into the final minutes of the game, before academy fly-half Healy scored a 50-metre penalty in the 81st minute to earn what had previously looked like an unlikely win for the province.\nThe draw for the 2020–21 European Rugby Champions Cup was made on 28 October 2020, with Munster being drawn in pool B. The province faced English side Harlequins, where former Munster player and coach Jerry Flannery was a coach, and French side Clermont, who were, at the time, the only French side to have ever won a Champions Cup game in Thomond Park.\nMunster's Champions Cup campaign commenced with a 21–7 home win against Harlequins on 13 December 2020, in which Gavin Coombes, Damian de Allende and Josh Wycherley made their tournament debuts. Coombes scored one try, with the other being a penalty try, with JJ Hanrahan and Ben Healy adding nine points of the kicking tee between them. Munster travelled away to Clermont for round two on 19 December 2020 and, despite trailing 28–9 to the home side at one point, fought back to earn a stunning 39–31 win at the Stade Marcel-Michelin. The tries for Munster came from Mike Haley, star-of-the-match CJ Stander and Kevin O'Byrne, with JJ Hanrahan scoring a perfect nine from nine off the kicking tee for the other 24 points.\nIt was announced in December 2020 that the 2020–21 Pro14 season would conclude after 16 rounds, with the winners of each conference advancing straight to the final on 27 March 2021. Four South African Super Rugby teams - the Bulls, Lions, Sharks and Stormers - were then be introduced in the \"Rainbow Cup\".\nIn early January 2021, the EPCR took the decision to temporarily suspend rounds 3 and 4 of the 2020–21 Champions Cup, following a directive from authorities in France that French clubs should not participate in the scheduled matches in response to health risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMunster's 20–17 win against Connacht in round 14 of the 2020–21 Pro14 on 5 March 2021 saw them become the first team to qualify for 2021 Pro14 Grand Final, as the victory gave them an unassailable 12 point lead at the top of conference B with two rounds remaining. Munster were beaten 16–6 by arch-rivals Leinster in the 2021 Pro14 Grand Final on 27 March 2021.\nThe Champions Cup resumed on the weekend of 2/3/4 April 2021 with the top eight teams from each pool at the time of suspension progressing to the round of 16, where Munster had home advantage thanks to their wins in the opening games against Harlequins and Clermont. Munster were drawn against Toulouse.\nIn an enthralling encounter at Thomond Park, Munster led 16–9 at half-time thanks to two tries from Keith Earls and two penalties from Joey Carbery, but Toulouse pulled level thanks to a converted try from Matthis Lebel. Gavin Coombes scored from close-range to give Munster the lead again, before Toulouse captain Julien Marchand responded with a try to level the scores again at 23–23. Substitute fly-half JJ Hanrahan scored a penalty to give Munster a 26–23 lead heading into the final 15 minutes of the match, but Toulouse's talismanic scrum-half Antoine Dupont scored two tries in 9 minutes to help the French club pull away on the scoreboard. A late consolation try from Gavin Coombes, his second of the match, in overtime meant the final score was 40–33 to Toulouse, who became just the second French club to win a European match at Thomond Park and advanced to an away quarter-final against Munster's pool opponents Clermont.\nMunster's Pro14 Rainbow Cup commenced with a 27–3 away win against Leinster on 24 April 2021, which was followed by a 38–10 home win against Ulster on 7 May 2021, before Munster's perfect start to the tournament was brought to a halt by a 24–20 home defeat against Connacht on 14 May 2021. The province returned to winning ways with a hard-fought 31–27 win against Cardiff Blues on 28 May 2021, however, Munster's hopes of reaching the final of the tournament were ended when northern pool leaders Benetton were awarded four match points after Covid-19 cases amongst their Welsh opponents Ospreys forced the cancellation of their scheduled fixture, giving the Italian team an unassailable lead at the top of the pool. Munster's final game of the tournament, and the season, was a 54–11 away win against Zebre on 11 June 2021.\nPlayer movements.\nThe 2020–21 season was unusual in that many of the players scheduled to join their new clubs during the summer pre-season ahead of the commencement of the new season were instead able to join during the mid-season break in the 2019–20 season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Below are the player movements originally scheduled for the 2020–21 season that instead took place in that mid-season break. \"Italics\" indicates players that transferred during the 2020–21 season.\nSenior squad.\nPlayers in\nPlayers out\nAcademy squad.\nPlayers in\nPlayers out\n2020–21 European Rugby Champions Cup.\nMunster were drawn in pool B for the 2020–21 European Rugby Champions Cup.

His playing career is best remembered for his role on the 1962–63 Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team, which won the 1963 NCAA Championship. Egan was the lone white starting player on a team that broke racial barriers by starting four black players in an era when two or three was considered the maximum.\nAfter college, Egan played three years in the short-lived North American Basketball League before retiring from basketball to work as a lawyer.\nIn 2002, Egan was inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. The entire 1962–63 Loyola Ramblers team was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013.\nEarly life.\nJohn Egan was born in the early 1940s and grew up in the South Side of Chicago. He was the second-oldest of nine children born to his parents, a police officer and a stay-at-home mother. Egan started playing basketball in elementary school. He played for St. Rita High School, but they never made it past the sectionals of the city tournament. In high school, Egan was scouted by the University of Iowa starting from junior year. The school ultimately offered him a one-year scholarship, but Egan felt he had outplayed others who were given full scholarships, and declined. He was later scouted by Loyola-Chicago coach George Ireland at a Catholic League All-Star game and eventually offered a full scholarship, which he accepted.\nCollege career.\nEgan played for Loyola-Chicago starting in the 1961–62 season. That season he played in 27 games and averaged 13.7 points per game.\nIn the 1962–63 season, Loyola went 24–2 in the regular season, then went on to win the 1963 NCAA University Division basketball tournament. Egan again averaged 13.7 points across 31 games.\nIn the 1963–64 season, Egan averaged 18.5 points across 28 games. Loyola finished 22–5 but lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament to Michigan, which Egan attributed to poor team chemistry.\nAfter college.\nAfter graduating Loyola, Egan played three years in the short-lived North American Basketball League. From 1964 to 1967, he played for the Twin City Sailors along with his former Loyola teammates Jerry Harkness and Les Hunter.\nHe also studied at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. He worked in the Cook County State's Attorney's office in the late 1960s before starting his own criminal defense practice.\nIn 1980, he moved to the Chicago-area village of River Forest, Illinois, having previously lived in the village of Riverside, Illinois. He has five children, two of them from his current marriage to Mary Egan, whom he met at the law office. Egan was one of several former Loyola players who was a fixture in the stands during the Ramblers' 2018 run to the Final Four.\nCareer playing statistics.\nNBA.\nSource\nHead coaching record.\nNBA.\nSource"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Zips represent the University of Akron in the NCAA's Mid-American Conference.\nAkron began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1901. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Akron's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The 1995–96 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a member of the Big Ten Conference during the 1995-96 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. It was head coach Dick Bennett's first season leading the Badgers. The team played its home games in Madison, Wisconsin at the UW Field House. Wisconsin finished the season 17–15, 8–10 in Big Ten play to finish in eighth place. The Badgers returned to the postseason by accepting a bid to the National Invitation Tournament, in which they beat Manhattan before falling to Illinois State in the second round.\nOffseason.\nHead coach Stan Van Gundy was fired on March 14, 1995, after one season that ended in a disappointing 13–14 record. The university announced the hiring of Dick Bennett as the 13th head coach in program history on March 31, 1995. Bennett had compiled a 361-188 (.658) record over 19 collegiate seasons at UW-Stevens Point and UW-Green Bay. Just prior to taking his \"dream job\" in Madison, Bennett had led UW-Green Bay to back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances out of the Mid-Continent Conference and Midwestern Collegiate Conference.\nThough 6-foot-7 Sam Okey had verbally committed to Van Gundy the previous year, the McDonald's All-American honored his commitment to play in-state for the Badgers. Okey was regarded across the country as a top 15 recruit despite hailing from tiny Cassville (pop. 1,025) in southwest Wisconsin.\nSeason summary.\nWisconsin started the Bennett-era with losses to a pair of top teams at the Maui Invitational, No. 3 Villanova and defending national champion UCLA (No. 4). In the midst of attrition, the Badgers still put together two separate four-game winning streaks during non-conference play, including a home defeat of Temple, 57–54, in overtime.\nIncumbent point guard Darnell Hoskins started the first nine games, then transferred to his hometown University of Dayton in mid-December with the team's record at 5–4. Freshman Duany Duany suffered a season-ending injury to his right foot during practice the weekend of Thanksgiving and played only two games before taking a medical redshirt. Sophomore guard Sean Mason also suffered a season-ending right knee injury late in a win over No. 21 Michigan, 51–46. In that game, the Badgers held the Wolverines to three second-half field goals to make Bennett the first Wisconsin coach to win his Big Ten opener since Walter \"Doc\" Meanwell in 1912.\nThe benefits of Bennett's defense-first mentality were evident on other occasions. Wisconsin finished the season 10–1 when holding opponents to fewer than 60 points. The Badgers also held Michigan State scoreless for the first 9:38 of the teams' game in Madison.\nWisconsin managed to go above .500 in conference play (3–2) for the first time after consecutive wins with only seven scholarship players available. First the Badgers beat No. 11 Iowa, 80–71, on January 13, 1996, behind 23 points from Okey. It was the third of 12 sellouts the team took part in away from Maui. The next game, defense and Mosezell Peterson's 23–11 double-double spurred Wisconsin to the aforementioned 61–48 win over visiting Michigan State.\nBeyond Okey's all-around brilliance, the emergence of freshman guard Hennssy Auriental eased the loss of Hoskins. After scoring in double figures in nine of 11 contests earlier in the year, Auriental made a game-tying three-pointer with under a minute left to help Wisconsin outlast Minnesota in overtime on January 24, 1996. The Montreal native also hit the game-winning jumper with seven seconds left at Illinois on February 3 to propel the Badgers to a 57–56 win.\nOn February 21, 1996, Northwestern completed a season sweep of the Badgers at the Field House when Geno Carlisle hit for 39 points in a game televised by ESPN. The loss was part of a 2–5 closing stretch that put an NCAA Tournament bid out of reach, despite a buzzer-beater by sophomore Sean Daugherty to beat No. 16 Penn State on March 6. Wisconsin settled for an NIT bid.\nPostseason.\nThe team hosted a first-round NIT game against Manhattan at the UW Field House. The Badgers held the Jaspers without a field goal for the final 11:28 of the game to pull out a 55–42 win. However, Peterson, the team's second-leading scorer, dislocated his left knee cap in the victory, an injury that would ultimately end the sophomore's career.\nWisconsin hosted Illinois State in the second round. Despite 28 points from Okey, a career-high to that point, the Redbirds advanced with a convincing 77–62 win.\nAwards.\nSam Okey\nSchedule.\n!colspan=8 style=\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=8 style=\"|National Invitation Tournament\nRecords &amp; trivia.\nOkey became the first player in Big Ten history to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists and blocked shots over a full season."

        "text": "The Hawaii Rainbow Warriors basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors basketball program in various categories, including points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Rainbow Warriors represent the University of Hawaii at Manoa in the NCAA's Big West Conference.\nHawaii began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1918. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Hawaii's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Minot State Beavers women's ice hockey represents Minot State University (MSU) in Women's Division 1 of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) and in Women's Midwest College Hockey (WMCH). MSU was one of the founding members of the ACHA's second women's division in 2006–07, but has seen its greatest successes within the last few years. The Beavers qualified for the ACHA National Tournament for the first time in 2017 and made it to the semifinals, and followed that up with back-to-back runner-up finishes in 2018 and 2019. Minot then jumped to Division 1, and was one of the founding members of WMCH with Liberty University, Lindenwood University–Belleville, the University of Minnesota, McKendree University, and Midland University.\nRyan Miner is the Beavers' current head coach, as he completed his third full season behind the bench in 2019–20.\nHistory.\nEarly years (2006–2016).\nMinot State joined the ACHA for the 2006–07 season, when the association added a second women's division. Throughout the team's first ten seasons, the Beavers played primarily a regional schedule of between 10 and 15 ACHA games per season, against opponents like North Dakota State University, International Falls, Minnesota's Rainy River Community College, the University of Minnesota–Duluth, and South Dakota State University.\nMSU had early stars like Kristin Bellanger and Betsy Doubek (who combined for 63 points in the 2006–07 season), Academic All-American and two-time leading scorer Chelsea Bender, and Makayla Sandvold, who also led the Beavers in scoring twice before helping to coach the team in 2015–16, but generally struggled on the ice more often than not. In an ACHA Division 2 West Region that usually included around ten teams at the time (with between two and four receiving invitations to the ACHA National Tournament, depending on the season), the Beavers never finished higher than fifth.\nThe team's two best shots at nationals came in 2006–07 and 2012–13. In the first of those seasons, MSU placed third in the first ranking of the year (a national ranking, as the division was not split into regions until the following season) behind the exploits of Bellanger, Doubek, and Lana Dubois. However, by mid-December, the Beavers had been passed up by Rainy River and the College of St. Scholastica and fell to fifth, where they would remain for the rest of the year, barely missing out on the four-team field. The 2012–13 campaign saw Minot come even closer, as MSU placed fourth in the West Region as late as the January 27, 2013 ranking, during a season where four teams from each of the two regions received nationals bids. However, disaster struck over the weekend of February 2 and 3, when the Beavers were swept at home by rival NDSU, thanks in large part to a four-goal series by future two-time Zoë M. Harris Award winner Kacie Johnson. In the final ranking, issued on February 13, the Bison jumped from fifth to third, pushing MSU down to fifth and out of the tournament.\nRise to prominence (2016–2019).\nThroughout most of the 2016–17 season, there wasn't much to suggest that a drastic shift in the program's trajectory was on the way. A new generation of talent arrived in 2015 and 2016, including Saskatchewan natives Mackenzie Balogh and Vanessa Grimstad, along with goaltender Shelby Tornato, and supporting players like Tylar Holland and Lauren Michayluk. Even with the additions, at 5–8–1 and ranked seventh in the West Region midway through January, the season looked like most others to that point for the Beavers. However, things clicked late in the year and Minot closed on a 5–0–1 run, including two wins against Division 1's Midland to close the regular season, the second of which involved two Holland goals to rally from a 2–0 deficit, followed by Grimstad's overtime winner. The unbeaten streak was just enough to sneak up to sixth place and grab the last seed for the newly expanded ACHA National Tournament, the Beavers' first-ever appearance.\nThe run continued in Columbus, Ohio, as Minot became one of the tournament's major storylines by dominating fourth-seeded (and unbeaten) Miami and then Buffalo, the East Region's top team, to win Pool C and advance to the semifinals. In particular, Balogh had the first breakthrough of her career, scoring ten times during the tournament (including five goals against Buffalo) to win the Beavers' first-ever ACHA award for hockey performance, a spot on the first all-tournament team. North Dakota State once again provided a helping of heartbreak in the semifinals though, spoiling a furious MSU rally from a 3–0 third period deficit and winning 4–3 on an Erica Sevigny goal off of scrum in front of Tornato with 2:22 remaining.\nEven though Minot struggled prior to the run in the late stages of 2016–17, that would not be the case for the team's remaining two seasons at the Division 2 level. In 2017–18, Ryan Miner stepped behind the bench full-time as the Beavers' head coach, after previously serving in different coaching and managerial roles while also playing for Minot's men's team and Dakota College at Bottineau. MSU added significant depth to its strong returning core (growing the roster from 13 to 22) and added stars like Sami Jo Henry, who had previously played with Balogh on the Melville Prairie Fire, and Minot High School product Bryanna Bergeron, who joined the team midway through the season. For the first time in program history, the Beavers had little issue qualifying for nationals, cruising to a 21–4–1 regular season record. After being swept by Division 1's Minnesota to open the year, not much went wrong for the Beavers, as MSU tore of 19 wins in the next 20 games – including four wins each against long-time thorn NDSU and two more sweeps of Midland. Balogh built on her freshman season by posting 33 goals and 51 points during the regular season (later adding four and 12 at the ACHA National Tournament) and was voted the Zoë M. Harris Award winner as the ACHA's player of the year. Grimstad, Henry, and Angie Lothspeich each added at least ten goals as well.\nA fateful showdown series against defending national champion Lakehead University at Maysa Arena on February 10 and 11 provided a dose of foreshadowing, as the Lakers ended MSU's hot streak with a 1–1 tie in the series opener, followed by a 3–1 win the next day. Those results enabled Lakehead to sneak past Minot to win the West Region's top seed, forcing the Beavers to settle for second place.\nNevertheless, the slightly-more-difficult schedule at the 2018 ACHA National Tournament didn't seem to faze the Beavers, who once again rolled through the pool round with little issue against Pool B opponents Buffalo and Liberty, or in a crossover game against Delaware Valley Collegiate Hockey Conference champion Montclair State.\nA rematch in the semifinals against North Dakota State followed, where the Beavers finally scored a measure of revenge against the team that blocked their aspirations both in 2017 and previously with a tightly fought 3–1 win to advance to the championship game. NDSU scored first, but were quickly answered by Bergeron, from Balogh's feed, before Balogh and Henry pulled MSU ahead. However, just as they had with the West Region rankings in February, Lakehead ended up on top of the ACHA thanks to a decisive 5–1 win in the championship game, the Thunderwolves' second straight title.\nEarly in the 2018–19 season, MSU announced that it would elevate its program to ACHA Division 1 in 2019–20, joining the Beavers men's team (which would go on to win its second national championship that year), along with a growing segment of its schedule, in a top ACHA division.\nAs dominant as Minot was the year before, the Beavers found another gear in their final Division 2 season – in 25 games, MSU scored 146 goals (5.84 per game) while surrendering just 38 (1.52 per game) on the way to a 24–1–0 regular season mark. They opened the year with a three-game sweep of a trip to play Division 1 teams Colorado and Colorado State, and went on to finish 9–0–0 against D1 opposition (with Midland and Minnesota standing as the other opponents), demonstrating a readiness to move to that level. The D2 portion of the schedule proceeded in a similar fashion – although Lakehead handed the Beavers their only regular season defeat in a showcase at Assiniboine on November 10, 2018, MSU took down the Thunderwolves the next day and on three other occasions over the course of the season to quickly take an iron grip on the West Region rankings. On the individual side, Balogh and Henry put up 62 and 48 points during the regular season to win All-American honors, while Grimstad, Bergeron, Haley Wickham, Beth-Ann Goudy, and Clarissa Lewis each had at least 20 points as well.\nJust as they had the previous two seasons, MSU made quick work of the pool round at nationals, blowing through Rowan, Mercyhurst, and Boston College, with none of the games finishing tighter than a five-goal margin, although the latter two did remain close into the late going before the Beavers cracked them open. The semifinals, against Sherbrooke, Quebec's Bishop's University were a bit tougher, as Tornato was forced to make 14 first-period saves (en route to 27 for the game), allowing Goudy (with a pair of goals), Wickham, and Grimstad to give MSU a 4–0 lead. The Gaiters battled back to within 4–2 early in the third period, before Bergeron and Wickham popped in goals in the final 2:11 of the contest to put Minot back in the championship game.\nThen, a stunner, en route to what was supposed to be a formal MSU coronation: Assiniboine pulled off one of the biggest upsets in ACHA history, denying the Beavers at the doorstep of a title for the second straight season by a 1–0 score, after Minot had gone 6–0–0 against the Cougars during the regular season, including 7–1 and 9–2 wins during its final weekend. Simone Turner-Cummer scored the game's only goal on a power play late in the first period, and ACC stymied Minot with a stout team defensive effort the rest of the way, helped along by some MSU penalty trouble and Marley Quesnel's 18 saves.\nElevation to ACHA Division 1 (2019–present).\nWhile Minot's ability to be competitive in D1 was never really in question thanks to a healthy selection of D1 opponents on previous schedules, another large recruiting class helped ensure that it was sustainable over an entire season. Miner plucked a pair of national champions, Lauren Blight and Mackenzie Heide, from the Assiniboine team that upset the Beavers in the 2019 D2 title game (joining ACC alumna Brooke Mead, who joined MSU in 2018). The transfer market also produced a pair of former U Sports players from the Regina Cougars in Camryn Clyne and Jensen Smigelsky, while the standouts from the true freshman class included star goaltender Jordan Ivanco, along with Maiya Aschberg, Megan Ferg, Story Navrot, and Alisha O'Hara.\nAs part of the move, the Beavers helped form a new conference, Women's Midwest College Hockey along with previous Western Women's Collegiate Hockey League members Minnesota and Midland, as well as fellow independents Liberty, McKendree, and Lindenwood–Belleville (although LU–B had also played in the WWCHL until 2018). The conference provided a degree of familiarity, as Minnesota and Midland had already become regular MSU opponents, although its calling card was its strength – Liberty (three times) and Minnesota had won national championships within the preceding decade, while McKendree, Lindenwood–Belleville, and Midland were newer programs that had quickly risen to contender status. Nevertheless, Minot was able to quickly prove it belonged in the group despite a 1–3–0 start, including a split at Colorado and a tightly contested sweep at the hands of LU–B that finished with Tessa O'Connor's overtime goal.\nFrom there though, MSU fired off an 18-game unbeaten streak to take hold of second place in the Division 1's national ranking for the remainder of the season. Notable results during the run included a revenge sweep of Colorado, a 3–0 weekend against perennial powers Adrian and Miami, and a 9–0–1 mark in WMCH games, including a four-game sweep of Minnesota and three wins with a tie against Midland.\nThe Beavers finished the regular season 17–3–1 and were seeded second for the WMCH playoffs under a system that used the ACHA rankings to establish conference standings, in light of an unbalanced schedule. MSU grabbed its first-ever win over third-seeded Lindenwood–Belleville in the semifinals, when Ivanco posted a 27-save shutout of the powerful Lynx, and Henry's second-period goal from Balogh was just enough offense. The next day, however, top-ranked and top-seeded Liberty used an Alex Smibert goal with 17 seconds remaining to take the league title by a 2–1 count.\nDespite the loss, Minot managed to hang on to their second-place ranking and were set to take on No. 7 McKendree in a best-of-three quarterfinal at the 2020 ACHA National Tournament, before the COVID-19 pandemic forced its cancellation. Henry (who was also a finalist for the Zoë M. Harris Award) and Ivanco became MSU's first two All-American selections at the Division 1 level.\nRecent season by season results.\nDivision 2.\n† The 2020 ACHA National Tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic\nACHA National Tournament results.\nThe Beavers have qualified for the ACHA National Tournament four times across both divisions, and were the runners-up in Division 2 in both 2018 and 2019.

The teams met for the first time on November 20 and 21, 2015, splitting a series in Fremont, Nebraska. In the first game, Bradi Sveet (two goals), Makayla Sandvold (one goal, two assists), and Kendall Becker (two goals, one assist) played central roles in running the Beavers out to a 4–0 lead in an eventual 6–2 win. Warriors coach Taylor Gross rallied her team for a 5–3 win the next day however, and Midland also earned a sweep later in the year at Maysa Arena, capped off by Malia Shimabukuro's overtime goal.\nWhile the two schools aren't near each other in any objective sense – they're 634 miles apart by car or bus – Midland is nevertheless among MSU's closest opponents, particularly at the ACHA Division 1 level, and MU always has rostered a healthy contingent from both North Dakota and South Dakota. The two teams, largely as a result of those things, have enjoyed a frequently-played, and often-heated, rivalry. In 2016–17, Midland fell victim to the Beavers' late-season hot streak in their push for nationals, as MSU earned a home sweep in the only meetings of the year, thanks to Vanessa Grimstad's overtime goal to finish a come-from-behind effort in the second game. That series decisively flipped things in MSU's favor; the Beavers swept all four meetings in both 2017–18 and 2018–19, even as Midland became a successful team, posting a winning record for the first time in 2017–18 and taking the Western Women's Collegiate Hockey League title (along with a first-ever bid to the ACHA National Tournament) in 2019.\nWhile the games from 2015 through 2019 generally meant little outside of bragging rights with the teams in different ACHA divisions, that changed in 2019–20 when the Beavers moved to Division 1 and joined Midland as a founding member of WMCH to formalize a rivalry that had already grown organically.\nMinot leads the all-time series 14–3–1, as of the end of the 2019–20 season.\nNorth Dakota State.\nThe series between the in–state rivals dates to the earliest days of ACHA Division 2, when the Bison were MSU's second ACHA opponent, and continued throughout the Beavers' time in the division – the teams met at least 53 times between 2006–07 and 2018–19.\nBoth teams have had periods at or near the top of D2, as NDSU qualified for the ACHA National Tournament in each of Minot State's last seven seasons at that level, winning a national championship in 2015 and making four other trips to the semifinals. The Bisons' first bid to nationals, in 2013, came largely at MSU's expense. The Beavers were ranked fourth in the West Region late in the season – good enough for the region's last invitation – headed into a showdown series with No. 5 NDSU. While the first game was close, the Beavers were done in by goals from all three Johnsons on the Bison (Kacie, Jackie, and Brittany) in a 3–1 defeat. After NDSU finished the sweep with a 7–1 rout the next day, they leaped over MSU in the rankings to, essentially, take Minot's bid.\nIn 2017, 2018, and 2019, MSU and NDSU each qualified for nationals, with the first two of those tournaments resulting in head-to-head meetings in the semifinals. The Bison ended Minot's Cinderella run of 2017 when Erica Sevigny delivered a 4–3 NDSU win with 2:22 left, after a goal by Angie Lothspeich and two by Mackenzie Balogh had erased a 3–0 third-period lead. MSU exacted revenge in 2018, advancing to the program's first national championship game with a 3–1 victory, offsetting an early Rachel Dorff goal with markers from Balogh, Bryanna Bergeron, and Sami Jo Henry, along with 18 Shelby Tornato saves.\nWith Minot's move to ACHA Division 1 while NDSU remains in Division 2, the rivalry is likely to diminish in importance, as the teams did not play during a season for the first time ever in 2019–20. In games played since 2014–15, the series is tied 11–11–1, although Minot has won the last nine meetings.\nPlayers.\nCurrent roster.\nAs of April 18, 2020."

The following year, as a nineteen year old, he made his debut in senior rugby for Rhodesia against South West Africa. Robertson went on to represent Rhodesia regularly from 1969 until 1979, but for two excursions in South Africa. First in 1972 when he moved to Johannesburg and only managed to make the Transvaal B team. In 1975 he moved to Cape Town and joined the Villager Football Club. He however could not secure a regular place in the Western Province team. When Robertson returned to Rhodesia at the beginning of 1976, he once again became an automatic first choice for the national side and was 1976 probably his greatest year.\nAt an international level, Robertson was selected to tour with the Springboks to France in 1974 and made his test debut against France on 23 November 1974 in Toulouse. He played in both test matches on the French tour and also played in five tour matches, scoring eighteen points for the Springboks. He missed out on any further test during 1975 and in 1976 he played in three of the four test matches against the touring All Black side captained by Andy Leslie.\nRobertson's career was halted against Transvaal at Salisbury in 1979 when he suffered a badly broken wrist and ultimately retired for rugby. In 1985, he tried a comeback with Northern Transvaal, but only played in three provincial matches.\nAccolades.\nRobertson was named Rhodesia's Sportsman of the Year in 1976."

It uses a hard rubber ball instead of a regular baseball made of leather. It has been rendered in English in a variety of ways, including nankyu baseball (\"nankyu\" means 'soft ball' in Japanese), nanshiki baseball and rubber baseball. In a narrow sense, Japanese-style baseball is a game that uses a hollow rubber ball, and in a broad sense, it includes a semi-hard baseball where a hard ball's outer coating is replaced with rubber. In contrast, the ball used in softball is most often leather but is larger than a regular baseball.　\nOther than the use of a different ball, the rules of Japanese-style baseball and regular baseball are the same. However, the difference in the ball has a distinctive effect on the playing style and equipment, and also changes the way the players use their body.\nHistory.\nDuring the Meiji era (1868–1912), baseball introduced from the United States became established in Japan in national competitions for secondary schools, high schools, and colleges, and children enjoyed playing baseball using hard tennis balls. However, tennis balls had the drawback of being difficult to use due to problems with their durability and speed, and the number of people playing the sport gradually declined.\nIn 1919, Toshin Rubber, a company based in Kobe, sold the world's first rubber baseball. As a result, the number of young people playing baseball started to increase again. In the following year, the was established in Kobe and a full-fledged national tournament for youth baseball was held. Then in 1925, a man called formed the same organization in Tokyo.\nBall types.\nThe ball has undergone a number of revisions, but the current dimensions were set out in December 2016 by the and the . Two types are specified: type M (major) and type J (junior). Type M has a diameter of . Meanwhile, type J has a diameter of .\nIn comparison, a regulation leather baseball is in diameter. An 11-inch ball used in softball has a diameter of about .\nGlobal popularity.\nJapanese-style baseball is often played by university teams, and there is a World University Japanese-style Baseball Tournament that takes place outside Japan. It was held in Guam in 2019. In addition, the International Boys Nankyu Baseball World Championship takes place annually.\nCuba has its own version of Japanese-style baseball, and a similar type of baseball is also played in Taiwan."

He served the standard one year from 2004 to 2005.\nDixon had to deal with the resignation of SRU Chairman David Mackay during his presidency; with unquiet among the clubs over Mackay's chairmanship. He stated: 'There is never a right time to make announcements such as this. Clearly we have been listening to the concerns of the member clubs, the key stakeholders in Scottish Rugby, and these changes are as a consequence of their concerns.'\nA Special General Meeting had to be called to chart the way forward for the SRU. Dixon made a statement to the press:\n\"The SGM was always about what the clubs wanted and they have stated that they want the issue of governance in Scottish rugby debated, so it will be. The amendment proposed by Heriot's on governance and supported by many clubs across the country, suggests on-going discussion to provide an acceptable solution in time for the AGM in June and we concur totally with that. To that end the current governance working party will re-convene - augmented by club expertise - and I expect there to be progress on governance as a matter of urgency. The priority now for everyone involved is to pull together to take the game in our country forward in the interests of Scottish Rugby. For that reason there will be no further separate communication from the General Committee or its members. All further statements will be on behalf of Scottish Rugby. We also hope to be able to announce the appointment of new non-executive directors by the middle of this week because it is important that we focus on the priorities of the game as much as possible. The appointments, as is the case with (short-term SRU chief executive and chairman) Fred McLeod, would be on an interim basis to the AGM in June. I believe the general committee should simply seek to work in effective management partnership with executive staff. That does not mean a hands-on approach but working within a fully integrated structure that promotes accountability, transparency and mutual trust. Communication must be the bedrock of the way ahead.\"\nHe was Director of Rugby at Linlithgow rugby club from 2016 to 2019."

        "text": "George Jack is a Scottish former rugby union player. He was the 120th President of the Scottish Rugby Union; and the first President to be elected in a three-way vote.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe played for Leith. He became club captain.\nProvincial career.\nHe was capped by Edinburgh District.\nHe was selected for Edinburgh District to play against Australia in their 1975 match at Myreside Stadium.\nAdministrative career.\nJack became the 120th President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He served the standard one year from 2007 to 2008.\nIn the first ever three way vote for President, Jack secured 57 votes; and his rivals for the job - Peter Brown and Jim Stevenson - polled 56 votes each. This meant that for the second round of voting Brown and Stevenson - since tied - had to cut cards to determine who would go forward for the final ballot against Jack. Peter Brown decided to pull out of the vote to let Stevenson go forward without cutting cards. Jack won the second and final round by 91 votes to 75 votes.\nDuring his presidency Jack defended the SRU's financial position. He stated that that would vigorously defend in court the claims of Edinburgh Rugby if needed. The Edinburgh side had claimed that they were owed a six fugure sum from the Scottish Rugby Union.\nJack stated:\n\"As we have continually reminded the new Edinburgh owners, the agreements between the union and Edinburgh Rugby form a binding contract and we expect Edinburgh to honour its obligations. This means, for example, that we expect Edinburgh to release players for Scotland duty. If they choose not to do so we will defend the union’s position and as necessary protect our rights in the best interests of the game. Ultimately, this means that if Edinburgh decides to press its claims through the courts we will, albeit with a heavy heart, defend our position vigorously.\"\nHowever set against this robust defence of the SRU finances was the closure - during Jack's presidency - of Scotland's third professional side: the Border Reivers. The closure cost was estimated at £1.76 million, though this was less than the annual budget to run the club."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Spiders represent the University of Richmond in the NCAA's Atlantic 10 Conference.\nRichmond began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1913. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Richmond's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons."

        "text": "The 1996–97 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a member of the Big Ten Conference during the 1996-97 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Head coach Dick Bennett completed his second season coaching with the Badgers. The team played its home games in Madison, Wisconsin at the UW Field House. Wisconsin finished the season 18–10, 11–7 in Big Ten play to finish tied for fourth place. The Badgers received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 7 seed in the East Region, where they were defeated in the first round by No. 10 seed Texas.\nSeason summary.\nWisconsin won 18 regular season games for only the second time in school history and recorded a winning Big Ten record for the first time since 1974. The Badgers finished as the Big Ten's top defensive squad, surrendering only 55.3 points-per-game over the entire season and 56.8 points-per-game on 39.7 percent shooting during conference play. They overcame the absence of two promising wing players with a strong frontcourt featuring lone senior Paul Grant, a 7-foot transfer from Boston College, at center. Grant led the team in scoring (12.5 ppg), while leading rebounder Sam Okey (8.5 rpg) and junior Sean Daugherty manned the forward spots as the second and third leading scorers, respectively.\nA highlight of a 6–0 start was when junior guard Sean Mason scored all 18 of his points in the second half and overtime to win at Temple, 64–57. The Badgers dropped two contests when Okey and guard Ty Calderwood took turns missing one game apiece, but the team's first loss at full strength came on the road to No. 15 Minnesota in the 10th game of the season. Wisconsin responded two nights later by using a 17–0 opening run to topple No. 12 Indiana, 71–58, to snap a 31-game losing streak to the Hoosiers.\nCalderwood made a pair of memorable game-winning plays during his junior year. On February 26, 1997, he hit a three-pointer with seven seconds remaining to beat Iowa, 49–48, to extend Wisconsin's Big Ten winning streak to six games. In the regular season finale, Calderwood sank two free throws and then poked the ball away on the following defensive possession to upset No. 2 Minnesota, 66–65.\nWisconsin earned a No. 7 seed in the NCAA Tournament, only its second bid in 56 years, but the Badgers lost to No. 10 seed Texas, 71–58, in a first-round game in Pittsburgh.\nNotable injuries.\nMason was Wisconsin's leading scorer (12.3 ppg) through three games when he went down with a season-ending ACL injury to his left knee in the opening minutes against Brown on December 7, 1996. He then redshirted. It was the second straight year Mason's season ended early due to an ACL injury.\nStill recovering from the severely dislocated left knee cap he suffered in Wisconsin's first round NIT game the previous season, junior Mosezell Peterson sat the entire year as a medical redshirt. Peterson never suited up for the Badgers again as a result of the foot drop he developed, accepting a student assistant role the following season.\nAwards.\nAll-Big Ten\nBig Ten Player of the Week\nSchedule.\n!colspan=8 style=\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=8 style=\"|NCAA tournament\nRecords and trivia.\nWisconsin went 5–2 against teams ranked in the AP Top 25.\nCalderwood tallied 63 steals in 27 games to lead the Big Ten with a 2.33 steals-per-game average.\nPrior to the season, Bennett awarded one-year scholarships to four walk-ons from the 1995-96 roster: juniors David Burkemper, Adam Schafer, Brian Vraney, and sophomore Mike Kosolcharoen. This brought the number of scholarship athletes on the 1996-97 roster to the allowed maximum of 13."

Haarms, reported as the nation's top available transfer at the time, had previously narrowed his choices to BYU, Kentucky and Texas Tech despite 25 or more schools contacting him regarding his decision. Because he is a graduate transfer, Haarms is eligible to play immediately. On June 12, 2020, it was announced that Brandon Averette would transfer from UVU to play his final year of college eligibility for BYU. Because Averette is a graduate transfer, he is eligible to play for the 2020–21 season. In June 2020 Brandon Warr was reported to have transferred to BYU from Westminster College as a walk-on. Warr will redshirt the 2020–21 season and play what was intended to be his final year of college eligibility during the 2021–22 season.\nOn October 14, 2020, the NCAA announced that all student-athletes involved in winter sports in 2020–21, including men's and women's basketball, would receive an extra year of eligibility, regardless of whether they or their teams actually participated in the 2020–21 season. This special rule, introduced due to COVID-19, allows five years of eligibility for student-athletes instead of the normal four. All entries in the \"Years Remaining\" column reflect this policy.\nReturned missionaries.\nOne returned missionary was added to the roster for the 2020–21 season. Hunter Erickson wore #1 and played at Timpview High School averaging 22 points his junior season. He is a 6'3\" guard and weighs in at 185 pounds. He also received scholarship offers from Utah, Cal State Northridge and UC Santa Barbara. Due to the special NCAA eligibility rules for 2020–21, he will have five years of eligibility instead of the normal four.\nCurrently serving missionaries.\nDuring the 2020–21 season, there are four team members that are currently serving full-time missions. Each of the four players have four years of eligibility remaining and will be part of the roster for the 2021–22 season. Nate Hansen and Trey Stewart will hold scholarship positions while Casey Brown and Jeremy DowDell will join as preferred walk-ons.\n2020 recruiting class.\nSix high school players committed to play for BYU from the 2020 recruiting class. Richie Saunders, Dallin Hall, Tanner Hayhurst and Tanner Toolson each plan to complete two-year full-time missionary service before joining the team for the 2022–23 season. Only Townsend Tripple and Caleb Lohner will join the roster for the 2020–21 season. Tripple had originally planned to complete missionary service before joining the team and was assigned to Argentina, but decided to delay his mission trip due to coronavirus and joined the roster as a walk-on. In early June, it was reported that Caleb Lohner, a four-star forward from Texas who had previously signed with Utah, requested a release from his National Letter of Intent to sign with BYU. Lohner was released, and on June 26 officially signed with the Cougars. Lohner will be a true freshman and is immediately eligible to play.\n2021 Recruiting class.\nJake Wahlin committed to BYU in early September and officially signed on November 11, 2020. Wahlin was recruited by Arizona State, San Diego State and New Mexico as well as other schools. He plans to complete a mission trip and join the team for the 2023-24 season. In addition, forward Fousseyni Traore from Wasatch Academy signed with the Cougars on November 19, over schools such as Seton Hall and Utah State. He will join the program for the 2021-22 season. Atiki Ally Atiki, from the London Basketball Academy in Ontario, Canada, verbally committed to BYU on February 15, 2021 and will also join the program for the 2021-22 season.\nPreseason polls and rankings.\nIn late October, BYU was selected to finish second in the West Coast Conference in the Preseason Men's Basketball Coaches Poll behind Gonzaga. Alex Barcello was named to the 2020-2021 All-WCC Pre-season Men's Basketball Team.\nIn early November, Matt Haarms was named as one of the preseason 20 players to watch regarding the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Center of the Year Award. Throughout the preseason, several media outlets ranked BYU among the top 100 Division I college basketball preseason teams for the 2020-21 season. Consistent with the WCC preseason coaches poll, many of the writers projected BYU second among WCC teams. A summary of the various preseason rankings that included BYU is as follows:\nPreseason injuries.\nSeveral players dealt with injuries during the off-season. Jesse Wade had for some time had a knee injury which has prevented him from playing for BYU since he transferred from Gonzaga. He sat out the 2018–19 season due to his transfer, but was not able to play during the 2019–20 season due to his knee injury. Wade was cleared by doctors to practice with the team on June 1, 2020. Alex Barcello injured his wrist during the game at Pepperdine on February 29, 2020, yet still played 33 minutes in the final game of the season in the WCC tournament against St. Mary's. Barcello later had surgery on his wrist and was expected to be ready for team practices on June 1, 2020. Connor Harding had lingering knee issues during the 2019–20 season. Harding had knee surgery during the summer and is expected to be available to play at the start of the season. Wyatt Lowell announced via Instagram that he was going to have shoulder surgery on July 22, 2020. Lowell indicated that he had torn his labrum the prior week playing basketball. He is expected to be recovering for several months. At a media availability interview on November 12, Mark Pope indicated that Townsend Tripple had recently injured his knee and would not be available to play at the start of the season.\nMedia coverage.\nRadio.\nGreg Wrubell and Mark Durrant return to call men's basketball for the 2020–21 season. Jason Shepherd will fill-in for Greg Wrubell whenever football conflicts arise (Dec 5 &amp; 15), and Greg will call a few games solo due to COVID-19 restrictions.\nTelevision.\nIn September 2019, the West Coast Conference (WCC) agreed to a multi-year deal through the 2026-27 season with ESPN and the CBS Sports Network to broadcast numerous basketball games each year. Previously, the WCC had an agreement with ESPN, but the new agreement adds additional television coverage of basketball games through the CBS Sports Network. Games broadcast on the CBS Sports Network are carried on channel 158 on the Dish Network, channel 221 on DirecTV and channel 269 on Xfinity. Under the terms of the deal, ESPN will broadcast 17 games during the regular season and the CBS Sports Network will broadcast a minimum of 9 games. ESPN will continue to broadcast the quarterfinals, semifinals and the championship game of the WCC tournament. BYU maintains the rights to broadcast home games on BYUtv (11.1 in Salt Lake City, Utah, channel 374 on the Dish Network, and channel 4369/9403 on DirecTV). Meanwhile Stadium broadcasts will be simulcast on KJZZ or KMYU because Utah doesn't have a Stadium tv affiliate.\nSchedule and results.\nBYU's games against Pepperdine, San Diego, and Pacific on December 31, 2020 and January 2 and 7, 2021 were postponed due to COVID-19 cases within those programs. On January 5, 2021, it was announced that BYU's road game against #1 Gonzaga had been moved from February 6 to January 7 to take the place of the postponed Pacific game. On January 8, it was announced that the Pepperdine game originally scheduled for December 31, 2020 had been moved to January 27, 2021. On January 26, it was announced that BYU's home game against San Francisco originally scheduled for January 30 had been postponed due to COVID-19 cases within San Francisco's program.\n!colspan=11 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=11 style=| WCC Regular Season\n!colspan=11 style=| WCC Tournament\n!colspan=11 style=| NCAA tournament\nGame summaries.\nSeries Histories are adjusted for the second consecutive season.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Cougars represent the University of Houston in the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference.\nHouston began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1945. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Houston's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2023–24 season."

        "text": "John A. \"Black Jack\" McDonald is an American retired ice hockey goaltender who played in the 1948 NCAA men's ice hockey tournament.\nCareer.\nMcDonald served as in the United States Naval Air Corps for four years during World War II. After the war, he resumed his studies and began attending the University of Michigan, where he joined the ice hockey team for the second half of the 1945–46 season. He established himself as the starting goaltender the following year and was instrumental in the success of the Michigan program immediately after the war.\nIn 1947, the NCAA formed a national tournament for the upcoming ice hockey season. Michigan was expected to vie for one of the two western spots but, with McDonald between the pipes, Michigan produced an 18–2–1 record and received the top western seed. In their opening round match Michigan and Boston College battled to a 4–4 tie in regulation which forced a 20-minute overtime. The rules at the time stated that the entire overtime session had to be played. This allowed Michigan to score twice in the extra session and win the game. This was the only non-sudden-death overtime in NCAA tournament history. The following game Michigan faced eastern powerhouse Dartmouth and found themselves down by two goals mid-way through the game. McDonald bore down and stopped all succeeding shots, allowing his team to climb back and go on a six-goal run to win the first NCAA ice hockey tournament.\nMcDonald won all of Michigan's 20 games that season, becoming the first goaltender to achieve that mark in one season. He equaled that total the following year, though Michigan fell in the National Semifinal. Because he had played in the second half of the 1945–46 season, he was only able to play during the first semester of the 1949–50 season. McDonald won 10 of 12 games and provided Michigan a foundation upon which they built the first college hockey dynasty.\nMcDonald graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering and at the time he was the winningest goaltender in the history of college hockey. His 50 wins would stand as a career mark for only six seasons, however, no one could take from him the honor of winning the first championship. He was inducted in the Dekers Hall of Fame in 1986."

An undersized center known for his ambidextrous play, Smith establishes himself as a top scorer in the Skyline Conference in his three varsity seasons. After averaging 18.9 points per game in his senior year, Smith was named a first-team All-American by the National Association of Basketball Coaches in \"Collier's\" magazine and a second-team All-American by \"Look\" magazine. Smith left Utah holding school and conference records for single season scoring, as well as the Skyline record for most points in a game.\nFollowing the close of his college career, Smith played for the Denver Central Bankers team in the National Industrial Basketball League (NIBL) and Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). Smith was named the NIBL Most Valuable Player for the 1952–53 season and an AAU All-American the following year.\nSmith died on September 29, 2019, in Salt Lake City at age 90."

        "title": "Jack Kirwan (rugby league)",
        "text": "John Patrick Kirwan (31 March 1896 – 20 October 1968), more commonly known as \"Jack Kirwan\", was a rugby union and rugby league player. He represented the Hawke's Bay province and Auckland in rugby union before switching to rugby league in 1924. He was selected for the New Zealand team in 1925 becoming Kiwi number 174 in the process. His grandson was also named John Kirwan and he went on to become a famous All Black in the 1980s and 90s before also switching to rugby league.\nEarly life.\nJohn Patrick Kirwan was born on 31 March 1896 in Reefton on the West Coast of the South Island. His parents were Kate and Robert Kirwan. Kirwan had 3 brothers and 4 sisters; Michael, Ellen, Mary, Kate, Anastasia, Robert, and Edward.\nKirwan was a telegraphist who worked in Tokomaru Bay on the East Coast of the North Island in 1914 when he was 18 years of age. He was then transferred to Napier. After serving in World War I he returned to New Zealand and began working at the Dannevirke Post Office.\nRugby beginnings on the East Coast.\nJack Kirwan moved to Tokomaru on the East Coast of the North Island in November 1914 where he began working at the local post office. During the 1914/15 summer he played cricket for Tokomaru Bay and then began playing for the Tokomaru City rugby union team in the Turnbill Cup against Waima and Wanderers. He scored tries in games against Wanderers on 8 May, and Waima on 5 July.\nKirwan was aged 19 by this time and in the match with Wanderers it was said that “a conspicuous feature of the game was the brilliant football played by Jack Kirwan (City). It was admitted by the most competent judges that a better exhibition had not been seen on this ground”. Kirwan was then selected for the Waiapu representative team to play against Tolaga Bay. In September, Kirwan was fare-welled at a function in his honour at the Magnet boarding house. He had proved to be a very popular figure in the local Tokomaru community. He was being promoted and transferred to Napier.\nWorld War I.\nWorld War I was well underway and Kirwan enlisted in the New Zealand Army on 26 June 1916 aged 20. He trained at the Featherston Military Camp before leaving New Zealand for Europe on 2 January 1917. Kirwan managed to play some rugby while serving. He played for the South Island New Zealand Forces Army team against the North Island on 4 May 1919 in a match his side won 10–6. Kirwan was stationed in Western Europe, predominantly France serving in the New Zealand Field Artillery. In December 1918 he was promoted to Bombardier.\nTragedy struck Kirwan and his family in early January 1919 when his sister Anastasia passed away after contracting influenza during the tail end of the 1918 pandemic. She had been caring for the sick during this time and was aged just 24.\nKirwan was promoted again to corporal on 15 January after fighting in the war had ceased. While the New Zealand troops remained in Europe, Kirwan played rugby games for some of the NZ army teams which travelled around playing matches. One such match was played for the New Zealand Army team stationed at Sutton against the New Zealanders from Brocton in early April and he scored a try in a 22–0 win.\nOn 16 November 1919 he boarded the \"Arawa\" to return to New Zealand, arriving home on 16 December 1919. He was then discharged having served for 3 years and 174 days in total including 2 years and 321 days overseas.\nKirwan received the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nPlaying career.\nMove to Dannevirke and Hawke's Bay rugby side.\nAfter being discharged Kirwan went immediately to Dannevirke where he resumed his career working in the Post Office as a telegraphist. He played for the Dannevirke Old Boys rugby club throughout the 3 years he was to spend there. He was selected to play for Southern Hawke's Bay against Northern Hawke's Bay on 10 July. In a description of the match Kirwan was said to be a “prominent member of the backs” in a match his side lost 6–0 before being selected to make his Hawke's Bay debut against Taranaki. The match was played on 22 July 1920 in New Plymouth with Hawke's Bay winning 8–6.\nIn 1921, Kirwan played further matches for Hawke's Bay against Wairarapa on 2 July and Manawatu on 6 July. He was then selected in the combined Hawke's Bay-Poverty Bay team to play against the touring South African international side. The match was a hard-fought one on 3 September at McLean Park in Napier before a crowd of 7,500. Kirwan played in the centres in a 14–8 loss. Playing alongside Kirwan was Bill Te Whata who would also like Kirwan switch to rugby league and represent New Zealand.\nIn 1922, Kirwan played 7 matches for the Hawke's Bay side. The first was against Wairarapa which was won 17–3. Kirwan then appeared in their famous 19–9 Ranfurly Shield win over Wellington on 10 August. Kirwan scored 2 tries in the win.\nHe was selected for the Hawke's Bay southern tour which involved matches against Otago, Southland, and Canterbury. They lost to Otago 11–8 at Carisbrook before a crowd of 11,000 though the Ranfurly Shield was not on the line for any of these matches. Hawke's Bay lost again 11–3 to Southland with 4,000 spectators looking on in Invercargill. Before finishing the tour with a 29–3 win over Canterbury. He finished the representative season off with a defence of the Ranfurly Shield against Bay of Plenty at Nelson Park in Hastings which they won narrowly 17–16. This was followed by another defence against King Country at McLean Park, Napier. In front of a crowd of 4,000 they won easily 42–8 with Kirwan scoring a try.\nIn 1924 Kirwan played in a 6–0 loss to Wairarapa on 21 July, and then a 10–6 win over Wellington in their second shield defence of the season at McLean Park in Napier before a crowd of 6,000. Kirwan was playing in the three-quarters outside George Nēpia who was five eighth along with Lui Paewai. Kirwan then missed a Southern Hawke's Bay match with Manawatu and a Hawke's Bay match with Poverty Bay as he was battling the flu before being selected to play against the touring New South Wales side. The team Kirwan was in was a combined East Coast-Poverty Bay-Hawke's Bay side and they won comfortably by 32 points to 15.\nKirwan then finished his season by playing in the Ranfurly Shield defences over Horowhenua on 8 September which they won 38–11, and over Auckland which was won 20–5. The match with Auckland was played in front of a huge crowd of 10,000 and Kirwan was heavily involved in several attacking raids. It was Hawke's Bay's last shield defence of the year. Two weeks later Kirwan travelled with the Hawke's Bay team to Auckland to play a return match at the Auckland Domain. The crowd numbered 22,000. Auckland reversed the earlier result winning by 17 to 9 in a match which raised £1000 for the construction of the nearby Auckland War Memorial Museum which had construction on it begin in 1929.\nFollowing the conclusion of the season Kirwan was transferred from the Dannevirke Post Office to the Auckland Chief Post Office located at the present day Britomart in the Auckland CBD.\nMove to Auckland, Marist Old Boys rugby and Auckland debuts.\nKirwan joined the Marist Brothers Old Boys rugby club who played in the Auckland Rugby Union competition. He debuted for them on 26 April in a match with College Rifles which his side won 6–3. He was then selected in the Auckland Provincial team to play his former Hawke's Bay side. The match acting as a trial for the All Blacks side. The match was played at Eden Park before a crowd of 12,000. Kirwan set up the Auckland Province side's first try with a reverse pass to Bert Cooke who scored under the posts. He did the same later in the match, reversing a pass back to Bill Wright who scored to make the score 15–6 with his team going on to win 18–9. Kirwan then gained a place in the North Islands Probables v Possibles match which was played in Wellington on 21 May.\nThe rest of the first half of Kirwan's season was spent playing for his Marist side in the local club competition. In total he played 7 matches for them and scored 2 tries and games against Grafton and College Rifles. On 23 July he went back to his family in Reefton due to “family affairs” and after he returned he played in 7 matches for the Auckland representative side through August and September. They were against Waikato (9–5), North Auckland (11–8), Hawke's Bay (6–23), Wairarapa (18–15), Wellington (9–8), Wanganui (8–10), and Taranaki (17–12). The match against Hawke's Bay was a Ranfurly Shield challenge with Kirwan kicking a drop goal on his old ‘home field’ of McLean Park, Napier.\nKirwan was reportedly unhappy with the lack of compensation provided for players in the representative team who often had to take time off work to play thus resulting in a loss in wages. This is cited at one of the main reasons Kirwan then transferred to the rugby league code which was much more proactive in compensating its players for any loss in wages through playing the game.\nSwitch to Rugby League.\nIn mid to late September Kirwan switched codes and joined the Marist Old Boys rugby league team. He made his debut for Marist in the championship final against Devonport United. The move caused some controversy with a \"The New Zealand Herald\" article stating that \"his inclusion was the source of a good deal of comment, and it is thought by many that, in the circumstances, the fact that he took part in a game with a direct bearing on the championship, was not according to the ethics of true sportsmanship.\"\nKirwan scored a try in a 20–17 win on Carlaw Park in front of an enormous crowd of 17,000 which was a club record for Auckland Rugby League at that time. It was said that Kirwan's \"presence was probably the deciding factor in giving Marist their narrow win.\" His try helped give Marist a 10–7 lead after he received a pass from Lyall Stewart and scored in the corner.\nThe \"Auckland Star\" further discussed the controversy saying \"the sole topic of conversation in … both League and Rugby since Saturday last has been the playing of Kirwan in the Marist Bros. team, and while the majority of followers hold the opinion that it was hardly the fair thing that Kirwan should be played…, others again hold that the Tykes were not only entitled to do so, but did what any other team would have done had they been similarly placed…\" The club freely admitting \"that for some time they had been endeavouring to get Kirwan to come over to League.\" Devonport were also trying to secure rugby players to join their side including Tonkin, Matson (Ponsonby) and Neil Ifwerson (Grammar).\nKirwan played two more matches for Marist before the season end. A loss to Devonport in the Roope Rooster competition and a 10–10 drawn match with City Rovers as part of the Labour Day celebrations.\nIn 1925, Kirwan appeared in nine matches for Marist Old Boys scoring 5 tries. The Marist season was over shadowed by the death of Bill Stormont who passed away after battling rheumatic heart disease. At the end of the season Marist played for the newly created Stormont Shield to memorialise Stormont which is still played for today. Kirwan scored a try but it could not prevent a Marist lost 23–22 to Ponsonby United.\nIn June Kirwan was selected to play for the North Island team against the South Island. North Island won 27–9 and following the match, which was part of a series of trials at Carlaw Park on the same day, Kirwan was selected in the New Zealand side to tour Australia. He was chosen in the three quarters along with Lou Brown, Hec Brisbane, Frank Delgrosso, and Jim Parkes.\nNew Zealand played 12 matches on the tour with Kirwan playing in 7 of them. He was part of the side which lost to New South Wales 4–7 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of 24,000 spectators. He was on the losing side again when New Zealand went down to an Australian Universities XIII 13–15. Kirwan scored a try in a 31–20 win over the Far North Coast side in Lismore before playing in the 20–29 loss to Queensland in Brisbane before a crowd of 10,000. His other three matches were in a 14–16 loss to Toowoomba, an historic 19–18 win over New South Wales, and a 25–26 loss to a Southern Division side in Cootamundra where he scored two tries.\n The match with New South Wales was before a crowd of 15,000 at the Sydney Cricket Ground who saw Kirwan make a break and sent Jim Parkes in for a try which gave New Zealand the lead. Kirwan arrived back in New Zealand on 25 August on board the \"Moeraki\" and 4 days later played for New Zealand against Auckland. New Zealand won before 15,000 by 41 to 17 at Carlaw Park.\nThe Queensland side that New Zealand had met on tour had arrived in New Zealand to play 11 matches of their own. Kirwan played against them for New Zealand at Carlaw Park on 5 September with New Zealand winning 25–24. On 9 September he wore an Auckland jersey against the tourists. This was his first ever appearance for the Auckland league representative side and the match was drawn 18–18. He again played Queensland for New Zealand but this time they were well beaten 35–14. Kirwan crossed for a try after making a break, kicking ahead, and winning the race to the ball. He was later awarded an “obstruction try” after Craig tackled a player without the ball after a break had been made a certain try would have been scored.\nIn 1926 Kirwan played 8 matches for Marist scoring 5 tries though the key focus for the representative players this year was in gaining selection for the New Zealand tour to England. Kirwan played in a match for Auckland against South Auckland on 26 June which Auckland won easily 49–15. He was then chosen for the North Island team to play the South Island a week later on 3 July. Kirwan scored a try after bursting straight through to score under the posts and give the North a 16–9 lead. He threw the final pass for Ben Davidson to score and he did the same for Bert Avery. He then played for the New Zealand Probables against the New Zealand Possibles with his side losing 15–32 though the Herald noted that he “was the soundest of the inside backs”.\n1926–27 New Zealand tour of England.\nKirwan was named in the New Zealand team to tour England though there was an issue with him securing leave for the tour. This was eventually resolved however and he departed with the team on 3 August on board the \"Aorangi\". The tour stopped off in Fiji where during a training session Kirwan lost a large amount of skin from his wrist and elbow on the dirt fields there which was requiring daily treatment to heal. Unfortunately for Kirwan and the New Zealand team the tour was plagued by issues between management and players throughout. A group of 7 forwards went on strike during the tour over issues regarding their treatment off the field, selection issues, and a poor relationship with coach Ernest Mair.\nNew Zealand played 34 matches in total with Kirwan playing in 18 of them. He played in the tour opener against Dewsbury which was a 13–9 win on 11 September in front of 16,000, before appearing again against Halifax 7 days later with New Zealand losing 13–19. He was not selected for the next four matches before playing against York on 9 October. Kirwan scored a try in a 19–11 win but he injured a muscle and was out for 4 weeks and 7 matches while he recovered. The selectors decided to rest captain Bert Avery and chose Kirwan to lead the side in their match with Salford on 3 November. New Zealand won the match by 18 to 10.\nKirwan scored a try in an 8–10 loss against Huddersfield on 6 November before being selected to play in the centres against England in the second test at Hull. Kirwan was said to have played well though New Zealand went down 21 to 11 meaning they had lost the series after losing the first test earlier. He played in games with Wigan Highfield and Batley won 14–2 and lost 17–19 respectively. His next appearance was off the bench in the test with Wales on 4 December at Pontypridd. New Zealand was soundly beaten by 34 points to 8. Kirwan was part of the side which went down 12–22 to St Helens before a big 36–15 win over Wigan though Kirwan had to leave the field injured. He had earlier switched to the fullback position after Charles Gregory was injured and Kirwan's own injury occurred when he was tackling Sullivan as he scored. He was badly cut over the right eye and was “bleeding profusely” having to leave the field to receive 3 stitches.\nHe missed the next two matches but with a large number of New Zealand's players on strike or injured by this point of the tour he was again selected to play against Pontypridd on Christmas Day. The tour was 27 matches and 14 weeks old prior to the Pontypridd match and he was to play in the final 6 matches of the tour including the 3rd and final test against England on 15 January in Leeds. New Zealand lost 17–32 in wet conditions in front of 8,000 spectators. The tour was now at an end and the team returned to New Zealand, arriving in Auckland on 1 March 1927.\nReturn to Marist and Auckland.\nLess than a month after arriving home from a rugby league season which had effectively lasted 9 months Kirwan was picked to play in a New Zealand team composed of the Auckland members of the touring side minus Kirwan's Marist teammate Arthur Singe who had been banned for life for his role in the strike on tour. Kirwan's side was to play against the local Auckland team at Carlaw Park and before a large crowd of 14,000 the ‘New Zealand’ side lost 21–24.\nBy now Kirwan was aged 32 and the match against Auckland was to be the last representative match of his career. He played 12 games for Marist in the 1927 season. In March 1928 at the Marist annual general meeting he was elected auditor and assistant secretary for the club. He had retired from the playing field and said “I think we have done our bit… and the aim of the club now is to give the most promising of the juniors a chance.” At a dinner for the touring England team on 4 August Kirwan was presented with a medallion for being a “loyalist” on the 1927–27 tour of England. Weeks later Kirwan decided to pull on the green and gold Marist jersey once again and he played in a match against City Rovers which Marist won 14–10. He then played in Marist's successful Roope Rooster campaign where they beat Richmond Rovers 14–9, Devonport United 10–5, and Ponsonby United to claim the title. He then played 4 further matches in the Labour Day competition which stretched over two weekends. Marist won all 4 matches over Huntly, Ellerslie, City Rovers, and Richmond Rovers to win the tournament. He now permanently retired from playing.\nRugby league retirement.\n At the end of the 1928 season Kirwan permanently hung up his boots. He was elected to the Marist board throughout the 1930s and 40s in the secretary and honorary secretary position. In 1932 he coached the side to the Stormont Shield and Roope Rooster. In 1945 he was chosen to be an Auckland representative selector along with Jim Clark and Dougie McGregor.\nPersonal life.\nKirwan was a Roman Catholic. He married Morven McDonald Fergus on 10 October 1925. Jack Kirwan died aged 72 on 20 October 1968. His next of kin was his son, Patrick Kirwan, of Māngere.\nJack Kirwan's grandson, John Kirwan, played 142 times for the Auckland rugby team and 63 times for the All Blacks before switching to rugby league in the mid-1990s. He then played for the New Zealand Warriors 35 times and later returned to the rugby code coaching Italy, Japan, and the Blues team in the Super Rugby competition."

        "text": "The DePaul Blue Demons basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball program in various categories, including points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Blue Demons represent DePaul University in the NCAA's Big East Conference.\nDePaul began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1923. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but DePaul's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The ODI matches formed part of both teams' preparations for the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup (which Australia won).\nOriginally, the tour was scheduled to take place in March 2021, and three Test matches were slated to be played. Those matches would have formed part of the 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship tournament. However, that tour was postponed in February 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBackground.\nIn December 2020, South Africa's One Day International (ODI) series against England was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, both cricket boards were looking at contingency plans for the Test series, including the possibility of playing the matches in Perth or the United Arab Emirates. An initial provisional start date for the tour of 18 February 2021 meant a tight turnaround from the end of South Africa's tour of Pakistan, although an update in January suggested the tour would begin in March 2021.\nOn 27 January 2021, Cricket Australia (CA) named their squad for the tour, ahead of any confirmation of the dates of the fixtures. However, on 2 February 2021, Cricket Australia announced that the tour had been postponed due to the pandemic. As a result of the tour being postponed, New Zealand qualified for the final of the 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. In October 2021, Cricket Australia said that they were looking at a window in 2023 to play the white-ball matches.\nSquads.\nOn 18 August 2023, Australia's Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc were ruled out of tour due to injuries. Ashton Turner replaced Smith in the T20I squad, whereas Marnus Labuschagne and Spencer Johnson replaced Smith and Starc respectively in the ODI squad. On the same day, Mitchell Marsh replaced Pat Cummins as Australia's ODI captain for the tour, with Cummins' participation in doubt as he was returning from a wrist injury. Initially, Glenn Maxwell was set to miss the ODI series to return home for the birth of his first child. However, he was also ruled out of the T20I series due to an injury and was replaced by Matthew Wade in the Australia's T20I squad.\n On the day of first T20I, Tanveer Sangha was added to Australia's T20I Squad, after Adam Zampa couldn't play due to illness. On 31 August 2023, Tim David was added to Australia's ODI squad. \nOn 10 September 2023, Michael Neser was added to Australia's ODI squad."

The tour consisted of three Women's One Day International (WODI) matches in September, a day/night Test match at the Carrara Stadium in Queensland between 30 September and 3 October, and three Women's Twenty20 Internationals in October. It was the first day/night Test match to be played by the Indian women's team. The last time the India women's cricket team played a Test match in Australia was during their tour in February and March 2006.\nOriginally, the tour was scheduled to take place in January 2021. However, in December 2020, the tour was put into doubt when the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) did not want to commit to the schedule. On 31 December 2020, Cricket Australia (CA) confirmed that the tour had been postponed by one year. On 20 May 2021, Cricket Australia announced the fixtures for the series. A points-based system was used across all three formats of the tour, with four points for winning the Test match, two points if the Test is drawn, and two points for each win in the limited overs matches.\nIn August 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, the tour schedule was moved back by two days, with all of the matches moved to Mackay and the Gold Coast in Queensland. In September 2021, Cricket Australia announced that Claire Polosak and Phillip Gillespie would be the on-field umpires for the one-off Test match.\nAustralia won the opening WODI match by nine wickets to record their 25th consecutive win in the format. The second match went down to the final ball, with Australia winning by five wickets to win the series. The third match also went to the last over, with India winning by two wickets with three balls to spare, breaking Australia's 26 game winning streak in WODIs, with Australia winning the series 2–1. In the one-off Test, more than 100 overs were lost across the first two days due to rain, with the match ending in a draw late on the fourth day. The first WT20I match was washed out after 15.2 overs of India's innings, with both teams sharing the points. Australia won the second WT20I by four wickets, to take an unassailable 9–5 lead on points across the series. Australia won the third and final WT20I match by 14 runs, winning the WT20I series 2–0, and winning the points-based series 11–5.\nSquads.\nAustralia did not name individual squads for the WTest, WODI and WT20I matches, opting instead to name a combined squad of 18 players for the tour. Australia's Tayla Vlaeminck was ruled out of the one-off Test and the WODI matches due to injury. India's Harmanpreet Kaur was ruled out of the first WODI match due to an injured thumb. Following the completion of the WODI matches, Australia's vice-captain Rachael Haynes was ruled out of the rest of the series due to a hamstring injury.\nTour match.\nAhead of the WODI matches, the teams played a warm-up match at the Ian Healy Oval in Brisbane, with Australia Women winning by 36 runs."

        "text": "The National Volleyball Association (NVA) is a professional indoor volleyball league in the United States. The league comprises 12 teams and is one of the top-level sports leagues below the major leagues amongst lacrosse, rugby, and indoor soccer. It has become one of the premier men's professional leagues globally, holding the best talent that the United States has to offer.\nThe league was founded in Costa Mesa, California, in 2017. The NVA's regular season runs from March to August, with each team playing nine games during the regular season. As of 2021, NVA players became the first volleyball athletes to have paid salaries in a Men's American Volleyball league outside of Puerto Rico.\nThe NVA is an active partner with the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA), which collaborates with the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) and the Olympic team. The league office and some individual team offices operate out of NVA's headquarters in Costa Mesa.\nNVA's 2020 season was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2021, two new teams joined the league, the Chicago Untouchables and the Dallas Tornadoes.\nThen in 2022, the Seattle Sasquatch and Colorado Kraken brought the league to a total of 12 teams.\nEntering the 2023 season, three new teams joined the league including, the Puerto Rico Pythons, Philadelphia Founders, and San Diego Wild. These teams took the place of the Tornadoes, Kraken, and Sasquatch.\nThe OC Stunners are the reigning champions, beating San Diego Wild 3–0 in the 2023 NVA Championship Cup Finals becoming the first team to obtain two National Titles with the NVA.\nTeams.\nNational Volleyball Association's 12 teams are divided between the National and American Conferences.\nSeason structure.\nThe regular season starts in March and goes through to August. Each team plays ten games at different exhibition locations. A team faces each of its opponents in its division two times a year (four games). Each team plays the three teams from the other division in their conference (American or National Conference) and then another three teams from one division in the opposing conference (six games). This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams. Over the seasons, each team will have played seven games against their conference and three from their opposing conference.\nThe NVA Cup Championship playoffs begin in August after the regular season with the top four teams in each conference, regardless of divisional alignment. Seeds are awarded in strict order of the regular-season record (with the FIVB point system to decide tiebreakers as needed). The playoffs follow a single-elimination tournament format. Losers from the semi-final matches are eliminated from the championship match but play in the bronze medal match. The winner of the NVA Finals receives the NVA Cup Trophy. In addition, the league awards the Most Valuable Player Award to the best-performing player of the championship event and seven awards for the best-performing player of each position during the regular season."

        "text": "The UT Rio Grande Valley Vaqueros men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Texas–Rio Grande Valley Vaqueros men's basketball program in various categories, including points, three-pointers, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Vaqueros represent the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) in the NCAA Division I Southland Conference.\nUTRGV did not formally exist until 2013, and did not begin operation until 2015. The school was established by the merger of two campuses of the University of Texas System—the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) and University of Texas–Pan American (UTPA). Before the merger, UTB was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), competing as the UT Brownsville Ocelots, while UTPA competed as the Texas–Pan American (or UT Pan American) Broncs in NCAA Division I. Before the merger took full effect, the UT System announced that the UTPA athletic program would transfer directly to UTRGV, with the new school thus fully inheriting UTPA's athletic history. In turn, this means that the history of UTRGV men's basketball officially begins with UTPA's first season of intercollegiate basketball in 1952–53 (when that school was known as Pan American College). The NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but the UTRGV record books include players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "1997–98 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1997–98 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a member of the Big Ten Conference during the 1997-98 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Head coach Dick Bennett completed his third season coaching with the Badgers. In the program's centennial season, the team played its home games in Madison, Wisconsin at both the UW Field House and later the Kohl Center, which the Badgers opened on January 17, 1998, with a 56–33 win over Northwestern.\nSeason summary.\nWisconsin was unable to build on the previous year's success during a tumultuous season. Down two of its top players by midseason, the squad struggled to shoot well consistently. The Badgers scored fewer than 50 points seven times, going winless in those games. Notably, Wisconsin let back-to-back home games slip away to Iowa (79-76) and Illinois (53-47 in overtime) to start February, which dropped its season mark to 10–13. The losses were part of an 11-game Big Ten losing streak to end the regular season, which was interrupted only by a non-conference win over Wisconsin-Milwaukee.\nTrue to Bennett's style, however, the Badgers led the Big Ten in scoring defense by allowing 62.6 points per contest. Though the team failed to receive a postseason invite, the substantial minutes played by four freshman laid groundwork for the memorable tournament run to come in 2000. Wisconsin rebounded from consecutive early losses to Pepperdine and Pacific to beat No. 18 Oklahoma and Montana to win the consolation bracket at the Big Island Invitational in Hawaii. Other highlights include going 2–1 against Top 25 teams in non-conference play and christening a new arena with a win.\nA No. 10 seed in the inaugural Big Ten tournament, Wisconsin opened against Penn State in Chicago. Freshman Maurice Linton's jumper in the final seconds advanced the Badgers, 52–51. In the quarterfinals, Illinois held Wisconsin to 10 points at halftime. A furious Badger comeback erased an 18-point deficit but ultimately fell short in the final six minutes.\nTy Calderwood injury.\nLingering complications from off-season knee surgery prevented Ty Calderwood from playing a single minute in 1997–98. It was a substantial blow, as a year earlier, the junior point guard led the Big Ten in steals and guided Wisconsin back to the NCAA Tournament. Calderwood was forced to take a medical redshirt. As a result, Mike Kelley became the first Badger freshman guard to start the season opener since Rick Olson in 1982.\nSam Okey's departure.\nJunior forward Sam Okey was suspended by head coach Dick Bennett for the start of the campaign, including the first two regular season games, reportedly for marijuana use. Upon his reinstatement, Okey battled back spasms which caused him to miss four of the next 13 games as Wisconsin fought to an 8–7 record. Clashes over his role, work ethic and off-the-court issues came to a head on January 13, 1998, when Okey quit the team. The Badgers went 4-12 the remainder of the season. Okey transferred to the University of Iowa to play his senior year.\nAwards.\nSean Mason was a Honorable Mention All-Big Ten pick by the coaches and media at the conclusion of the season.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=8 style=\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=8 style=\"|Big Ten tournament\nRecords.\nSean Mason made the first field goal in Kohl Center history on January 17, 1998, vs. Northwestern.\nA February 11, 1998 loss to Northwestern, in which he went 0-for-4 from beyond the arc, was the last game Sean Mason would fail to make a three-pointer in his Badger career. His streak of 39 straight games with a three-pointer began February 14, 1998 against Penn State and was a school record until being eclipsed by Bronson Koenig in 2016."

        "title": "List of FIFA World Cup winning managers",
        "text": "The FIFA World Cup is considered the most prestigious association football tournament in the world. The twenty-two World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams. Brazil have won five times, followed by Germany and Italy with four titles each; Argentina with three titles, France and Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain, with one title each. The role of the manager is to select the squad for the World Cup and develop the tactics of the team. Pressure is attached to the role due to the significance of winning a World Cup and the lack of day-to-day contact with players during the regular club season aside from international breaks.\nAlberto Suppici led the Uruguay national team to victory in the inaugural tournament in 1930. Vittorio Pozzo is the only person who has won the World Cup twice as a manager, in 1934 and 1938 with Italy. Twenty-one different managers have won the World Cup and all winning managers led their own country's national team. Five other managers finished as winners once and runners-up once; both Helmut Schön (winner in 1974, runner-up in 1966) and Franz Beckenbauer (winner in 1990, runner-up in 1986) for West Germany, Carlos Bilardo (winner in 1986, runner-up in 1990) for Argentina, Mário Zagallo (winner in 1970, runner-up in 1998) for Brazil, and Didier Deschamps (winner in 2018, runner-up in 2022) for France.\nCarlos Alberto Parreira holds the record for managing at the most FIFA World Cup final tournaments with six appearances while managing five different national teams. Schön, who led West Germany to victory in the 1974 World Cup, has managed the most matches in the tournament at 25, and won a record 16 matches during his spell as West Germany manager from 1966 to the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Suppici is the youngest manager to win the World Cup, being 31 in 1930. Zagallo and César Luis Menotti were also in their 30s when they won the World Cup. Zagallo was 38 years old in 1970 and Menotti was 39 years old in 1978. Vicente del Bosque is the oldest coach to win the World Cup at 59 in 2010.\nThree men have won the tournament both as a player and as a manager; Zagallo (as a player in 1958 and 1962, as a manager in 1970), Beckenbauer (as a player in 1974, as a manager in 1990) and Didier Deschamps (as a player in 1998, as a manager in 2018). Both Beckenbauer and Deschamps were also the captain of their respective teams while winning the World Cup as a player."

        "title": "2020 Belmont Stakes",
        "text": "The 2020 Belmont Stakes was the 152nd running of the Belmont Stakes and the 109th time the event took place at Belmont Park. It was run June 20, 2020, and was won by Tiz the Law, the first New York-bred winner of the event since Forester in 1882. The race is one of the three legs of the American Triple Crown, open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.\nDue to concerns relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the race, which is normally the last Triple Crown race of the season, was run as the first race in the 2020 Triple Crown series and was shortened to instead of the usual , which it had been run at since 1926. This was the first time since 1931 for the Triple Crown races to be run in a different order and the first time for the Belmont Stakes to be run as the opening leg of the Triple Crown.\nBackground.\nSince 1969, the American Triple Crown has been scheduled to begin with the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May, followed by the Preakness Stakes two weeks later in mid-May, and the Belmont three weeks after that in early June. Major prep races for the series are normally run from three to six weeks before the Derby. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to the shutdown of several race meetings starting in mid-March, which led to the postponement or outright cancellation of several of these major preps.\nThe shutdowns led Churchill Downs to reschedule the 2020 Kentucky Derby to the first Saturday in September. Pimlico followed suit by rescheduling the 2020 Preakness Stakes to the first Saturday in October. The New York Racing Association (NYRA) decided instead to hold the Belmont Stakes on June 20, three weeks after racing in New York reopened on June 3. Because of the disrupted racing schedule, NYRA also decided to shorten the race from its traditional distance of to . The race thus went from being the longest race of the series, the so-called \"test of the champion\", to the shortest. NYRA had considered running the race at , but this would have meant starting the race on the clubhouse turn — a serious disadvantage for some horses in a large field. \"I think given the circumstances this was the best choice,\" said trainer Todd Pletcher of the revised distance. \"A mile and a half wasn't going to fit many horses at this stage. It was the right move.\"\nThe Belmont was the first major sporting event in New York state since the pandemic began. The event was held behind closed doors, with NYRA's online and off-track betting was permitted via the NYRA Bets site and other OTB parlors. Total prize winnings for the race were $1 million, down from $1.5 million the prior year.\nField.\nAfter the new date and distance were announced in mid-May, the field was expected to have up to 16 starters. However, Nadal and Charlatan, both leading contenders trained by Bob Baffert, were subsequently injured. This left Tiz the Law as the clear favorite, and connections of several other contenders decided to skip the Belmont to focus on preparing for the Kentucky Derby. \"There's other opportunities out there,\" said owner Barry Irwin of his decision to bypass the race. \"Even though it's the Belmont Stakes, it's not the Belmont Stakes. Whatever prestige that would have come from it, that little extra something that makes you run in a race like that is lacking this year. If your goal is to get into the Kentucky Derby, why do you want to get your socks knocked off by Tiz the Law when you can go elsewhere?\"\nThe ten starters were:\nResults.\nOnly essential personnel such as trainers, grooms and a limited number of press were allowed to attend the race – not even the owners were allowed on site. Governor Andrew Cuomo gave the traditional call for \"Riders up\" remotely. Several sources commented on the eerie silence of the racetrack, with one comparing the experience to filming a movie. \"You come out of the tunnel on your horse and there's nobody there,\" said jockey Manny Franco. \"But this is the world we are living in.\"\nGiven the shortened distance and the dimensions of Belmont Park, the race started in a chute at the end of the backstretch. Tap It to Win went to the early lead and set a moderate pace. Tiz the Law raced in stalking position a few lengths behind, then launched his move on the turn. He moved by Tap It to Win near the head of the stretch and continued to draw away, winning by lengths. Dr Post closed ground late to finish second.\nBarclay Tagg became the oldest trainer, at age 82, to win the Belmont. Tagg was previously best known as the trainer of 2003 Kentucky Derby winner Funny Cide, who also won the Preakness but failed in his Triple Crown bid by finishing third in that year's Belmont. Both Funny Cide and Tiz the Law are owned by Sackatoga Stable, although the composition of the ownership group has changed over the years. Sackatoga's managing partner Jack Knowlton remarked on how rare it was for such a small operation to have such success. \"We buy New York-breds — that's our game — and we don't spend a lot of money. We've been with Barclay Tagg for 25 years, and I keep telling everybody Barclay doesn't get a lot of big horses, big opportunities, but when he does, he knows what to do.\"\nJockey Manny Franco earned his first win in the Belmont Stakes in his first start in the race. Tiz the Law became the first New-York bred to win the race since Forester in 1882.\n Starts–Wins–Places–Shows, prior to the Belmont Stakes\nSource: Equibase chart\nPayouts.\nSource: Equibase Chart"

The Cape Breton Open has been held by Cromarty each year annually thereafter.\nThe Open attracts some of the top tennis players from across the province, drawing 50 to 75 players in open division (men' and women's open singles, open double, and mixed doubles), men's singles over-35, over-45, over-55, and over-65, women's singles over-35, and men's and women's doubles over-35 Masters divisions.\nHistory.\nThe Sydney Lawn Tennis Club was incorporated by an Act of the Nova Scotia Legislature on 28 April 1893. The club was founded by five gentlemen.\nA few years later, the Sydney Lawn Tennis Club decided to purchase about an acre of land at Sherwood, part of the Dr. McLeod estate on Reservoir Brook in Sydney. They believed this would provide enough land to construct five tennis courts, a bowling green, handball courts, and quiet grounds. The price was to be about $2,500. On the evening of 24 April 1902, a meeting of subscribers to the Tennis Association were held at the offices of Burchell &amp; McIntyre in Sydney. By June 1902 two courts had been completed and were in use every evening by the players. The remaining courts were to be completed as soon as the weather would permit.\nA formal opening of the Lawn Tennis grounds at Cromarty took place on Saturday afternoon, 19 July 1902 and was largely attended. [Sydney Daily Post, July 21, 1902] The Sydney Lawn Tennis Club's Annual Tournament, held on the club's new grounds at Cromarty Street, commenced on 5 August 1902.\nThe following year, An Act to incorporate the Sydney Tennis Association, Limited was passed on the 11th day of April, A.D., 1903. Five members were named in the Act's introduction. That same year the third annual Nova Scotia Lawn Tennis Association Annual Tournament was held on the grounds of the Sydney Tennis Club.\nThe first club house was built by 1905. The association transferred title of the property to the Kinsmen in 1958. The ownership of the property was transferred to the City of Sydney (now the Cape Breton Regional Municipality - CBRM) on 1 January 1963, and the club has since that time been operated by the Cromarty Tennis Club Society (Incorporated 22 May 1980), and its predecessors. The CBRM gives the club a $5,000 annual operating grant."

        "title": "Derrick Lewis (basketball)",
        "text": "Derrick Raymond Lewis (born August 1, 1966) is an American-French former professional basketball player. A Tarboro, North Carolina native, he played high school basketball at Archbishop Carroll High School in Washington, D.C., where he was a McDonald's All-American as a senior in 1984. He then played in college with the Maryland Terrapins, staying for 4 years; he was a first-team All-ACC selection and an Honorable mention All-American as a junior in 1987, and a second-team All-ACC selection as a senior in 1988. As of 2020 he is the program's all-time leader in blocks and ranks third in rebounds. He was drafted in the third round of the 1988 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls (62nd overall), but he did not play in the NBA. After one season in the Continental Basketball Association, Lewis moved to France where he played for 15 seasons, 13 of which in the LNB Pro A, the top level of French basketball, where he was a 5-time blocks leader and a 2-time All-Star.\nHigh school career.\nLewis was born in Tarboro, North Carolina to Gertie and Robert Lewis. He attended Archbishop Carroll High School in Washington, D.C., where he was coached by Carroll Holmes and he was a varsity starter since his sophomore season. In his junior season, Lewis averaged 17 points, 11 rebounds and 6 blocks per game, and was selected in the All-Metro First Team by the \"Washington Post\".\nAs a high school senior, Lewis was ranked among the best players in the nation, with the \"Knoxville News Sentinel\" ranking him number 6th overall. He averaged 21 points, 15 rebounds and 8 blocks per game, earning All-Metro MVP and first-team honors, and was selected as the Metro area Mr. Basketball by the \"Washington Touchdown Club\". He also earned recognition at national level, being named a second-team \"Parade\" All-American selection, and was selected to play in two high school all-star games: the Capital Classic and the McDonald's All-American Game. In the Capital Classic Lewis he scored 18 points, playing as a center and shooting 9/11 from the field. In the 1984 McDonald's All-American Boys Game he scored 4 points, all on free throws attempts, playing for the East team.\nCollege career.\nFreshman season.\nLewis chose to wear number 33 at Maryland and was selected as a starter by coach Lefty Driesell since his freshman year. He was considered one of the best defensive freshmen in the country due to his shot blocking ability. After coming off the bench for the first three games of the season, Driesell made him the starting center of the team: he was only the second freshman to start as a center during Driesell's stint as a coach at Maryland. On November 21, 1984, in a Great Alaska Shootout game against Tennessee, Lewis recorded a career-high 10 blocks; he tied the mark later in the season, posting another 10-block game against Towson State on January 21, 1985. On February 24 he posted a career-high 14 rebounds against Wake Forest. In the quarterfinals of the 1985 ACC men's basketball tournament against Duke, Lewis scored a new career high of 16 points.\nDuring his freshman season Lewis started 34 of 37 games, averaging 6 points, 6.5 rebounds, 0.9 assists and 2.7 blocks per game in 30.1 minutes of playing time. He recorded 99 blocks for the season, which at the time was the single-season all-time high at Maryland. His 241 rebounds made him the 7th best rebounder in the conference. He was named ACC Rookie of the Week twice during the season, and finished second in the ACC Rookie of the Year award voting behind Duane Ferrell of Georgia Tech.\nSophomore season.\nLewis was confirmed as a starter for his sophomore year, and was the only player on the roster to start all 33 games. He scored double figures in 13 games; he tied his career-high of 16 points twice in the season, against Ohio State and Georgia Tech. He also posted a season-high 12 rebounds twice, against Duke and Clemson. His season high in blocks was 7 against North Carolina on February 20, 1986.\nDuring the 1986 NCAA tournament, Lewis recorded a double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds against Pepperdine, and scored 5 points (with 4 blocks) in the loss against UNLV. During the tournament, Lewis played as a power forward, as the center was Terry Long. He recorded 71 season blocks, and led the team in steals per game with 1.1.\nJunior season.\nAs a junior, Lewis gained an increased scoring load after the departure of Len Bias, who had left the team for the 1986 NBA draft. He was again named the starting center, and the team captain. On January 28, 1987 Lewis recorded a triple double against James Madison with 29 points (a new career high), 23 rebounds (career high) and 12 blocks (another career high, and the best single-game mark in Maryland history). On February 18 he recorded his second triple double (the only player to record more than one in Terrapins history) with 32 points (his career high), 10 rebounds and 10 blocks against UMBC. On February 27 he recorded 10 blocks against Maryland Eastern Shore.\nLewis was the second best scorer in the ACC with 19.6 points per game behind Horace Grant of Clemson (21.0), and was the second best rebounder in the conference with 9.5 per game (again behind Grant who had 9.6). He led his team in scoring, rebounding, blocks, steals and field goal percentage. He recorded 114 total blocks in the season, improving his own record established in his freshman season. He led the ACC in blocks with a 4.4 average, which also ranked him 2nd in the whole NCAA Division I behind David Robinson's 4.5. His 35.8 minutes per game in the season are the 8th best mark in the history of the Terrapins. He earned a selection as the ACC Player of the Week, and at the end of the season he was named in the All-ACC First Team with 182 votes (4th overall in votes behind Horace Grant, Kenny Smith and Joe Wolf), and was selected as an Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press. He also finished third in ACC Player of the Year voting with 7 votes, behind Kenny Smith and Horace Grant. He was also among the 10 finalists for the Adolph Rupp Trophy, and received 2 votes.\nSenior season.\nLewis was considered one of the college basketball top defensive players when he returned to Maryland for his senior season; \"Sporting News\" ranked him the third-best power forward in college basketball behind Danny Manning and J. R. Reid, and included him in the preseason All-American watchlist. He played mostly in the power forward position as a senior, with the center position assigned to Brian Williams and Tony Massenburg. Lewis was named ACC Player of the Week once during the season, starting all 31 games and playing 34.8 minutes per game, the 10th best single-season mark of all time at Maryland. He recorded 55 blocks in the season, reaching a career total of 339. He led his team in points, rebounds, steals and blocks, and ranked third in assists; he also shot 45.5% from three. He ranked 4th in the ACC in rebounding with 7.6 per game. At the end of the season he was selected in the All-ACC Second Team with 69 votes.\nLewis ended his career at Maryland with 1,458 points, 948 rebounds and 339 blocks. As of 2020, he ranks 19th all-time in points, third in rebounds and first in blocks. He also ranks second in career blocks per game average (2.7) behind Joe Smith (3.0). He posted 23 double doubles in his career, and he is the only player in Maryland history with 2 triple doubles.\nProfessional career.\nBeginnings and rookie season in the CBA.\nAfter the end of his senior season at Maryland, Lewis was automatically eligible for the 1988 NBA draft. In April 1988 he was selected in the United States Basketball League (USBL) draft in the 6th round (50th overall) by the Jersey Shore Bucs. In May he was invited to the US national team trials to be part of the squad for the 1988 Summer Olympics; he did not make the team. In a June 28 article, the \"Baltimore Sun\" reported that Lewis was projected to be a second-round pick in the NBA draft: he was selected in the third round (62nd overall) by the Chicago Bulls. He spent the summer training with the Bulls, and signed a contract on October 7, 1988; however, he was waived on October 25, 10 days before the start of the 1988–89 NBA season. Lewis then decided to sign for the Rockford Lightning in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), the main minor league in the United States. In his rookie season as a professional player, Lewis played 52 out of 54 games of the 1988–89 CBA season, averaging 8.5 points, 8.5 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 1.1 steals and 2.4 blocks: he ranked third in the CBA in blocks (126 in 52 games for a 2.4 average) behind John Campbell of the La Crosse Catbirds and Jerome Henderson of the Topeka Sizzlers. He also participated in the playoffs, appearing in 16 games and averaging 10.2 points, 8.9 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1 steal and 1.8 blocks; his team reached the CBA finals, where they lost to the Tulsa Fast Breakers.

On February 24, 1990 he recorded the only quadruple double in French league history against Lorient, with 20 points, 11 rebounds, 12 steals and 10 blocks. In that game he also established records for most blocks (10) and steals (12) in a single game. He stayed with Reims for the following season where he played 11 games, with averages of 14 points, 10.1 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 1.5 steals and 2.7 blocks, again leading the league in blocks. In the spring of 1991, after the end of the 1990–91 Nationale A1 season, he left France and returned to the United States, signing for the New Haven Skyhawks of the USBL, playing the 1991 season with the team.\nReturn to France and Pro B.\nIn late 1991 Lewis returned to France and played 5 games with Reims, averaging 13 points, 6.6 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steal and 3.4 blocks per game in 35.8 minutes of playing time.

        "text": "Cameron Bouchea Thomas (born October 13, 2001) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was a consensus five-star recruit and one of the best shooting guards in the 2020 class. He is the youngest player in NBA history to score 40 points in three straight games. He played college basketball for the LSU Tigers.\nEarly life.\nThomas was born in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan while his mother was living there. When he was seven, he won a contest by making 33 free throws in a row.\nAs a freshman, Thomas began playing basketball for Oscar F. Smith High School in Chesapeake, Virginia. He did not play in his sophomore season because he and his mother \"weren't on the same page\" as the team's coaching staff. For his junior season, he transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia, where he joined Cole Anthony and Kofi Cockburn in one of the most touted teams in the country. Thomas averaged a team-high 26.2 points, 3.8 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game, leading his team to a 31–5 record. In July 2019, he was named Offensive Player of the Year at the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League after averaging a league-best 29.5 points per game for Boo Williams. As a senior at Oak Hill, Thomas averaged 31.5 points, six rebounds and 3.4 assists per game, leaving as the program's all-time leading scorer. Thomas posted 30-plus points in nine games, including two 40-point performances. He led his team to the Tournament of Champions title, where he was named most valuable player. Thomas was selected to play in the Jordan Brand Classic.\nRecruiting.\nOn November 18, 2019, Thomas committed to play college basketball at Louisiana State University (LSU). He chose the Tigers over an offer from UCLA, among others, after taking official visits to both schools.\nCollege career.\nIn Thomas's college debut on November 26, 2020, he scored 27 points in a 94–81 win against SIU Edwardsville. Thomas led all freshman in scoring with 23 points per game, while also averaging 3.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game. He was named to the First Team All-SEC. On April 15, 2021, he declared for the 2021 NBA draft, forgoing his remaining college eligibility.\nProfessional career.\nBrooklyn Nets (2021–present).\nThomas was selected with the 27th pick in the 2021 NBA draft by the Brooklyn Nets. Thomas was later included in the roster of the Nets to play in 2021 NBA Summer League. On August 5, 2021, Thomas signed with the Brooklyn Nets. Thomas was named NBA Summer League MVP with Davion Mitchell averaging 27 points per game and was the Summer League leading scorer, and was named to the Summer League First Team. On October 19, 2021, Thomas made his debut in the NBA, coming off the bench to score two points in a 104–127 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. On November 20, while on assignment with the Long Island Nets, he scored 46 points in a 114–110 win over the Raptors 905.\nThomas joined the Nets' 2022 NBA Summer League roster. On July 18, 2022, Thomas was named to the All-NBA Summer League First Team. On December 10, Thomas scored a then-career-high 33 points in a 136–133 win over the Indiana Pacers.\nOn February 4, 2023, Thomas put up a then career-high 44 points in a 125–123 win over the Washington Wizards. The next game, Thomas scored a new career-high 47 points in a 124–116 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He became the second youngest player in NBA history to score at least 40 points in consecutive games, behind LeBron James. On February 7, 2023, Thomas put up 43 points in a 116–112 loss to the Phoenix Suns. With this game, Thomas became the youngest player in NBA history to score at least 40 points in three consecutive games. On February 10, 2023, he was fined $40,000 by the NBA for saying \"no homo\", which was perceived as anti-gay, during a post-game interview following a game the night before against the Chicago Bulls.\nOn October 25, 2023, Thomas put up 36 points off the bench in a 114–113 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. His 36 points were the most off the bench in a season-opener in NBA history. On November 6, Thomas scored a season-high 45 points during a 129–125 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. On December 16, Thomas put up 41 points in a 124–120 loss to the Golden State Warriors. He also surpassed Bernard King's record for the most 40-point games in Nets history at age 22 years old or younger with his sixth career 40-point game."

This left the league with just three teams. The final blow came from the formation of the Intercollegiate Hockey League between Harvard, Yale and Princeton, which rendered the IHA superfluous. The IHA would play one final season before dissolving in 1913. Cornell would not be a member of another ice hockey conference until 1961.\nOn the ice the results for the Big Red were even worse. The offensive punch was still missing and without now-graduated Malcolm Vail to serve as a safety net in goal, the team's goals against ballooned. The team lost every game with only one being remotely close.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Gators represent the University of Florida in the NCAA's Southeastern Conference.\nFlorida began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1915. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Florida's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "Sailing SV Delos",
        "text": "Sailing SV Delos is a YouTube channel that chronicles the travels and adventures of video bloggers aboard the sailing vessel \"Delos\". The boat is owned by Brian Trautman, who sails with his wife Karin Syrén and their daughter Sierra (aka Nugget). Trautman and Karin sailed Delos for many years with Trautman's brother Brady, along with an ever-changing crew, including Alex Blue. The team often invites new crew members aboard for their journeys who contribute to sailing, boat maintenance, and filming. The films include experiences and adventures, which include island exploration, hiking, underwater diving, partying, meeting local people, boat maintenance, and simple day-to-day living, boat repairs, emergency procedures in addition to their experience crossing oceans. Delos has made several ocean crossings, sometimes through heavy weather conditions such as severe lightning storms, and once tackling a 50-knot gale en route to Madagascar.\nBackground.\nTrautman grew up in Flagstaff, Arizona with a love of the outdoors, and worked as a diesel mechanic during his high school years, later earning a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington. He worked at Microsoft before starting his own software company but he soon grew tired of 60-hour workweeks. What inspired him to think about crossing oceans in a boat was reading the book \"Three Years in a 12-Foot Boat\" by Stephen G. Ladd. He spent several years researching and saving money and narrowed down his list of boats to French-made Amel Super Maramu. \nHis first voyage began in 2009 in Seattle, Washington in the United States. He sailed to Mexico where he was joined by his brother Brady, and the two of them along with Brian's then-partner sailed for New Zealand. There he met his future wife Karin Syrén who began sailing with them. In their early days, they often had to work in local marinas to make money for boat repairs and fuel. In 2014, the crew re-thought their business model, and learned how to support their income from YouTube with crowdfunding and Patreon campaigns.\nThe channel.\nThe Delos team has made more than 300 videos on its YouTube channel. The channel saw rapid growth over the years from 90,000 subscribers in December 2016 to (as of ). On Instagram, it had over 170,000 followers . It received 1.8 million views per month in December 2019. A 2019 report in \"Yachting World\" magazine suggested that the crew made $14,000 for each video from paying donors, and produced about four videos each month.\nThe boat.\nDelos is a 53-foot long Amel Super Maramu, built in La Rochelle, France purchased by Trautman in 2008. It sleeps six people comfortably. From 2008 to 2021, Trautman and crew sailed Delos more than 70,000 miles. As a former electrical engineer, Trautman used his knowledge to make various improvements to the boat installing lithium-iron-phosphate batteries with battery management system to power the electronics on the vessel, including induction cooktop. The crew has taken numerous steps to make Delos environmentally-friendly.\nPhilanthropy.\nThe crew engaged in numerous philanthropic endeavors, such as contributing to restoration efforts on the island of Dominica which was ravaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017. In 2019, they donated US$50,000 to various charities such as the Surfrider Foundation which seeks to protect the world's oceans."

The WolfPack represent the North Carolina State University in the NCAA's Atlantic Coast Conference.\nNC State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1910. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but NC State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Games have been broadcast on television in some capacity since the league's first season in 1987.\nEarly years on regional sports networks (1987–1990).\nIn Philadelphia, Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League games were televised by PRISM. Larry Rosen, Tony Seaman, and Mark Zumoff were the commentators for PRISM. Meanwhile in New England, the 1990 Championship Game between the Philadelphia Wings and New England Blazers was broadcast on NESN with Leif Elsmo and Steve Glover on the call.\nNational coverage.\n1990s.\nPrime Network (1991–1993).\nFrom 1991-1993, the Prime Network was the primary national television broadcasters for the Major Indoor Lacrosse League. Commentators that Prime employed included Craig Johnson and Leif Elsmo as well as Bill Beroza, Bruce Todman, and Jon Horton. For the Buffalo market, 1992 Championship Game between the Buffalo Bandits and Philadelphia Wings was broadcast live on Empire Sports Network.\nESPN and ESPN2 (1994–1999).\nOn November 30, 1993, ESPN signed a six-year agreement with the National Lacrosse League. This particular package of 12 games would be telecast on ESPN2, on a delayed basis. The first ever Monday night game on ESPN2 featured the Detroit Turbos and the Baltimore Thunder. Playoff broadcasts, meanwhile, would air on both ESPN and ESPN2.\nESPN's broadcast of the 1994 Championship Game between the Philadelphia Wings the Buffalo Bandits, was the first live telecast by ESPN of a National Lacrosse League game. ESPN employed Leif Elsmo, Kristi Lee, and Quint Kessenich as commentators during this period. On December 1, 1995, it was announced that ESPN would broadcast games on Monday nights beginning at 7:30 p.m. ET beginning in the 1996 season.\nOn January 9, 1998, the NLL announced deals with regional sports networks such as Comcast SportsNet, Buffalo's Empire Sports Network, and Washington, D.C.'s Home Team Sports.\nThe CTV SportsNet used Joe Bowen, Brian Shanahan, and Suneel Joshi on commentary for their Canadian coverage of the 1999 Championship Game between the Toronto Rock and Rochester Knighthawks.\n2000s.\nCNN/SI and Rogers SportsNet (2001–2002).\nFor the 2001-02 and 2002-03 seasons, CNN Sports Illustrated broadcast 17 regular season games beginning on November 24, 2001, the All-Star Game, and five playoff games, including the Championship Game. Just like with ESPN's prior coverage, CNN/SI used Leif Elsmo and Quint Kessenich on commentary.\nMeanwhile, on September 20, 2001, the NLL announced that Canada's Rogers Sportsnet (formally CTV SportsNet) would broadcast 26 regular season games, the Playoffs, and the Championship Game during the 2001–2002 season.\nFox Sports Net (2004).\nOn December 17, 2003, the league announced a new partnership with Fox Sports Net to broadcast nine regular season games NLL games beginning as well as the All-Star Game. Fox Sports Net employed Mitch Hyder, Brian Shanahan, and Bill Hall as commentators.\nFive days after the Fox Sports Net deal was announced, the NLL announced an agreement with New York's YES Network to carry eight regular season games in featuring the Buffalo Bandits and the Rochester Knighthawks for the 2004 season.\nNBC, ESPN2, and America One Television (2005–2006).\nThe NLL had its All-Star Games and Championship games on NBC in 2005 and ESPN2 in 2006. When NBC aired the NLL, it marked first time that live broadcasts of lacrosse would be nationally aired on American network television. Mike Emrick, Brian Shanahan, and Mark Morgan provided commentary for NBC. The NLL paid NBC approximately paid $250,000 per hour to NBC. The 2005 All-Star Game in itself, garnered an 0.8 rating (or more than 800,000 U.S. households) for NBC. The NLL moved the date of the game from February 27 to February 26 to accommodate NBC's schedule. The Championship Game was also televised in Canada on The Score, and internationally via CNBC International, CNBC Asia, and on Armed Forces Network.\nOn February 1, 2005, the NLL announced new broadcast partnerships with the America One Television Network, Cox Sports Television and Comcast Regional Networks. One month later, the NLL announced an agreement with Canada's Bell Express Vu, to broadcast out-of-market games on its pay-per-view channels.\nVersus and ESPN2 (2007–2008).\nIn 2007, Versus regularly scheduled NLL games on Saturday nights. Versus however, cancelled their NLL coverage in 2008 season, due to a dispute between the Professional Lacrosse Players' Association and the NLL owners in completing the collective bargaining agreement. ESPN2 and ESPN360 wound up picking up the broadcasting rights for the 2008 NLL Championship Game.\n2010s.\nVersus, CBS Sports Network (2010–2012).\nIn 2010, it was announced that Versus would broadcast that season's championship game. For the 2011 season, it was announced that Versus would begin its coverage with the All-Star Game. This was followed by 6 weekly games, and 2 playoff games, one of these being the championship game. Versus would drop the NLL for the league's 2012 season; U.S. broadcast rights were instead picked up by CBS Sports Network, which aired eight regular season games.\nThe Lacrosse Network, Fox Sports Go, Twitter, and SportsLive (2013–2017).\nIn 2012, the NLL reached an agreement with The Lacrosse Network, a partnered YouTube channel, to distribute all of the 2013 season's games onto YouTube. All games were available on YouTube after the broadcast and most games were broadcast live.\nDuring the 2016 season, Fox Sports Go streamed a package of 50 games. Streaming was taken in-house during the playoffs, with the NeuLion-operated NLLTV streaming games from the division semifinals onward. The following season, the NLL reached several streaming deals, with CBS Sports Digital's SportsLive service streaming all games, and Twitter streaming a package of selected games throughout the season under a two-season deal.\nB/R Live (2018–2020).\nIn 2018, the league announced a multi-season deal with Turner Sports to stream games exclusively on Bleacher Report's over-the-top service B/R Live. During the 2019 season, the NLL reinstated a game of the week package, streaming on both Facebook and Twitter.\nFor the national broadcasting teams assigned to call the 2019 NLL Finals, New England Black Wolves announcer, Brendan Glasheen would provide play-by-play with Toronto Rock color commentator Brian Shanahan as the analyst for the games hosted by the East Division winner. Meanwhile, Colorado Mammoth announcer Teddy Jenner would provide play-by-play along with Vancouver Warriors color commentator Brad Challoner as the analyst for the games hosted by the West Division winner. Finally, Toronto Rock floor reporter Ashley Docking would serve as the sideline reporter for all games during the NLL Finals.\nESPN and TSN (2022–present).\nFor the 2022 season, the NLL reached a new exclusive media rights agreement with ESPN Inc., under which all games will stream on ESPN+ in the United States, and at least 10 will air on an ESPN television channel. TSN, a Canadian sports channel minority-owned by ESPN, also returned as the domestic broadcaster of the league in Canada, airing a weekly \"game of the week\" package on Saturday nights, playoff games, and streaming all other games on its website. \nAfter previously depending on individual teams to provide game broadcasts for B/R Live, the league adopted a centralized production model for the majority of games. A skeleton crew of commentators, camera operators, and other technical staff are present on-site, while the remainder of the production is based out of one of three hubs in Clifton, Salt Lake City, or Toronto. For games televised by TSN, the network employs its own on-site production; both the Toronto hub and TSN games utilize the resources of Dome Productions, which is 50%-owned by TSN parent company Bell Media."

The conference tournament was held in December and had no impact on the conference standing; the conference NCAA tournament bid was awarded to the season champion.\nThis team was the recipient of what many Hilltopper fans referred to as “the worst call in NCAA tournament history.” In the second-round game against Michigan, Western Kentucky forced a jump ball with seconds left, while leading by 1 point. Western Kentucky's Greg Smith was called for a foul during the jump and Michigan's Cazzie Russell made two free throws to win the game. Still pictures show Russell not jumping on the play and then leaning in to make contact with Smith.\nHaskins was joined on the All-Conference and OVC Tournament teams by Steve Cunningham, Dwight Smith, and Greg Smith\nSchedule.\n!colspan=6| Regular Season\n!colspan=6| 1966 NCAA University Division basketball tournament"

It was released to streaming services on 14 May 2020 by Sony Music Australia. The song is a motivational piano-led power ballad about hope and overcoming hardship.\nBackground.\nThe song was first teased in an advert for the Nine Network drama \"Doctor Doctor\" on 25 April, initially titled \"Bridge Over Troubled Dreams\". On 14 May, Goodrem premiered the song during a livestream on Facebook and Instagram, and released it on streaming services immediately after.\nThe song was included as a B-side on the CD edition of Goodrem's follow-up single \"Paralyzed\".\nReception.\n\"Keep Climbing\" was positively received by critics upon its release, with \"Idolator\" remarking that the song provides \"the kind of stripped-back, vocal showcase that Delta has perfected since breaking through with \"Born To Try\" and \"Lost Without You\" in 2002\" and that it \"might just be her best single since \"Wings\"\". Thomas Bleach commented \"beginning with just simple piano keys, she starts to add layers with strings and soulful melodies that turn into a beautiful gospel moment towards the end of the song where the choir powerfully sings the phrase \"keep climbing\"\", and that \"the song ripples with perfect waves of emotions that drive the structure and climatically builds to give you a really beautiful and special moment.\"\nVideos.\nA lyric video for the song was uploaded to YouTube at the time of release. The video features the lyrics appearing above an aerial shot of a piano, on which Goodrem is playing the piano part for the song.\nA live performance recorded at the NSW Art Gallery was released on May 23, while a studio recording video was released on June 15."

        "text": "Hayley Williams (born June 3, 1990) is a Hungarian-American professional ice hockey player and member of the Hungarian national team, currently playing in the European Women's Hockey League (EWHL) with HK Budapest. She previously played in the Zhenskaya Hockey League (ZhHL), the National Women's Hockey League (NWHL), and the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL), and is a three-time professional all-star, having been selected to the 2016 NWHL All-Star Game as well as the 2019 and 2020 ZhHL All-Star Games.\nWilliams represented Hungary at the IIHF Women's World Championship in 2022 and 2023. She represented the United States in the women's ice hockey tournaments at the 2013 Winter Universiade and the 2015 Winter Universiade, winning a bronze medal in 2013.\nPlaying career.\nYouth hockey.\nWilliams spent most of her youth career with Team Illinois, before finishing with the Chicago Mission as an under-19 (19U) player. At the 2008 USA Hockey Girls 19U National Championships in West Chester, Pennsylvania, she scored the winning goal in triple overtime to help the Mission – a team also featuring future Olympians Megan Bozek and Kendall Coyne – down Little Caesars for the national title.\nCollege.\nBemidji State (2009–10).\nWilliams committed to play NCAA Division I hockey with the Bemidji State Beavers women's ice hockey program and immediately contributed to a successful 2009–10 season. Despite going 3–22–3 overall in 2008–09 and being a unanimous WCHA last-place pick for 2009–10, the Beavers made history during the league playoffs. With Williams in the lineup for both wins, Bemidji State University (BSU) rallied to defeat St. Cloud State in the best-of-three opening round of the WCHA tournament, snapping a 14-game playoff losing streak and advancing to the WCHA Final Face-Off for the first time in program history.\nHowever, her time with the Beavers was derailed by academic issues, and Williams ultimately played only 16 games with BSU.\nDespite leaving the hockey team after 2009–10, Williams remained enrolled at Bemidji through the summer of 2012, including playing outfield for the Beavers softball team during the 2011 season.\nRobert Morris (2013–14).\nBy the fall of 2012, Williams had moved home to the Chicago area, and began volunteering for the USHL's Chicago Steel which, at the time, played its home games at Edge Ice Arena in Bensenville, Illinois. Through a chance meeting with a former teammate who went on to play for Robert Morris University Illinois (RMU; which shared Edge Ice Arena with the Steel), Williams wound up enrolling at RMU and practicing with the Robert Morris Eagles women's ice hockey team during the 2012–13 season. She then joined the Eagles' full roster for 2013–14, marking an official return to college hockey after a three-and-a-half year absence.\nWilliams immediately found chemistry with one of the Eagles' established stars, Ramey Weaver. The pair would go on to form two-thirds of the ACHA's best line, as each earned a spot on the ACHA's first All-American team and the duo finished 1-2 among the national scoring leaders. Williams scored 34 goals and 73 points that season in route to winning the Zoë M. Harris Award as the ACHA's Player of the Year. Weaver, who wound up her career after 2013–14 as Robert Morris' all-time leading scorer, added 32 goals and 55 points.\nThe Eagles largely breezed through their regular season schedule. With Williams putting up nine games with four points or more (including one late-season stretch where she accomplished the feat four times in five games), and delivering late winning goals against Colorado State and Adrian on two of the few occasions RMU was seriously challenged. The Eagles were 22–5–4 during the regular season, good for second in the Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association (CCWHA) behind Miami, and were ranked third or fourth in the ACHA throughout the entire year.\nThings abruptly turned south at playoff time however, as RMU was eliminated in the pool round at both the CCWHA playoffs and the ACHA National Tournament. Williams, for her part, was named first team all-tournament at both events after posting 12 points in six games between the two.\nMiami (2014–15).\nWilliams transferred to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio for the 2014–15 season, adding even more firepower to a RedHawks team that had quickly risen to prominence to win both the CCWHA and ACHA titles in 2013–14.\nWith Miami, Williams largely picked up where she left off the year before, putting up 15 points in her first four games of the season as the RedHawks routed Lindenwood–Belleville and Midland. She got even better in November as the games got tougher, taking home the ACHA's Harrow Player of the Month award by scoring seven goals as Miami defeated a string of top teams including UMass (in a rematch of the 2014 national championship game), Adrian, Minnesota, and Liberty. Williams then burned her old RMU team for a goal in each game of a sweep in December, and delivered a two-goal, two assist effort in a 7–4 win over Rhode Island.\nThe RedHawks were the wire-to-wire number one team and only lost twice during the regular season, a January defeat at home to Penn State (Miami's first loss in more than one calendar year) and another the next month against Michigan State, although Williams and four other key RedHawks missed the latter contest while at the 2015 Winter Universiade tournament in Spain. The quintet then returned for the CCWHA playoffs, in time to help the team win a second consecutive league title with a 4–2 win over Michigan, with Williams contributing a goal and an assist in the championship game.\nDuring most of the ACHA National Tournament at York City Ice Arena in York, Pennsylvania, Miami looked like a safe bet to repeat its 2014 title. Despite a tie with Adrian, the RedHawks won Group B with wins over Minnesota and Michigan, then had little issue with Grand Valley State in a crossover semifinal. In the final however, Liberty scored three goals during one 64-second first-period stretch, outweighing Williams' second-period goal as the Flames won their first national championship by a 4–1 count.\nDespite the setback, and for the second straight year, Williams conducted a clean sweep of the major national honors. She was once again voted as the Zoë M. Harris Award winner after a combined total of 59 points, becoming just the second player at the Division 1 level to earn the award twice (another player has accomplished the feat since), while also winning first team all-season and all-tournament honors for both the ACHA and CCWHA.\nWilliams went on to complete her Bachelor of Science degree from Miami in Kinesiology, through the Sport Leadership and Management program with a Coaching concentration, in 2016 while playing professional hockey.\nProfessional.\nNWHL (2015–16).\nAfter learning of the launch of a new North American women's professional league, the National Women's Hockey League (rebranded as the Premier Hockey Federation (PHF) in 2021), Williams attended free agent camps during the summer of 2015 ahead of the NWHL's inaugural season, eventually earning a contract with the Buffalo Beauts. With their signings announced by the Beauts at the same time, she and UMass Minutemen alumna Paige Harrington became the first former ACHA players to sign in the league and the first in any North American women's professional league since the 2002–03 season.\nWilliams scored her first NWHL goal on November 22, 2015, burying to tie a game against the Connecticut Whale at 6–6 with 3:23 remaining in the second period, although the Whale would go on to win in a shootout. She added four assists while playing in 17 of the Beauts' 18 regular season games.\nA fan vote determined the last four participants in the 1st NWHL All-Star Game on January 24, 2016, and, after receiving 6,384 votes, Williams was added to Team Knight, an All-Star team captained by Team USA and then-Boston Pride player Hilary Knight. She went on to score Team Knight's only goal of the game in a blowout loss to Team Pfalzer, captained by then-Buffalo Beauts players Emily Pfalzer.\nThe 2015–16 Buffalo Beauts season, saw a third-place finish in the standings with a 5–9–4 record, and an appearance in the first-ever Isobel Cup Final after rallying to upset Connecticut in a best-of-three semifinal. However, the Beauts were defeated in the championship series by the Boston Pride.\nCWHL (2016–18).\nAfter the Beauts only offered Williams a spot as a \"practice player\" for the 2016–17 season (practice players are members of the team, but not permitted to play in games unless the team is otherwise shorthanded), Williams looked for opportunities in the Canadian Women's Hockey League and earned a roster spot for the 2016–17 CWHL season with the Brampton Thunder via tryout. She played in 14 games with Brampton, helping the team to a 12–10–1–1 (W–L–OTL–SOL) record and a third-place finish in the regular season, although they were quickly eliminated in the best-of-three semifinals by Les Canadiennes de Montréal.\nThe following season, the Thunder relocated to Markham, Ontario, which is located on the opposite side of Toronto from Brampton. Williams, who still lived in Buffalo dating to her time with the Beauts, negotiated a trade to the Toronto Furies (which played at the Mastercard Centre For Hockey Excellence in Toronto's western neighborhoods, a bit closer to Buffalo than Markham) and spent 2017–18 with the Thunder's archrival. Playing frequently with Jenna Dingeldein, Jessica Vella, and Carolyne Prévost, Williams rediscovered her offensive touch with the Furies, finishing the year fourth on the team in scoring with 14 points. She scored her first CWHL goal on November 11, 2017, to help Toronto beat the Calgary Inferno in a shootout. The next month, she assisted on Jessica Platt's first career goal on December 7, then was named the Furies' player for the game for a two-assist effort in a loss to Calgary ten days later. Late-season highlights included a Furies sweep of the perennially-contending Inferno on January 27 and 28 by 3–2 and 5–2 scores, with Williams scoring the winning goal in the first game on a 5-on-3 advantage with 3:21 remaining. She also capped off the weekend by scoring an empty-net goal to seal victory in the second game, in front of a national television audience on Sportsnet.\nDespite those individual successes, the Furies uncharacteristically struggled throughout most of the season, missing the playoffs with a 9–17–1–1 record and a sixth-place finish.\nZhHL (2018–20).\nAlong with former Beauts teammate Tatiana Rafter, Williams jumped to the other side of the globe for the 2018–19 season as an import player in the Russian Zhenskaya Hockey League (ZhHL) for SK Gorny, announcing the transaction on Instagram.\nWilliams arrived to find a team in something of a chaotic state. Originally known as Arktik-Universitet Ukhta and operated in conjunction with Ukhta State Technical University, the organization was in the middle of a complete overhaul that would see it rebrand as SK Gorny for the start of the 2018–19 season, then relocate from the small industrial city of Ukhta to the major metropolis of Saint Petersburg midway through the campaign. Furthermore, Arktik-Universitet had not been successful on the ice, winning just four times in 24 games during 2017–18.\nThanks to the arrivals of Williams and Rafter, along with a nucleus that included Russian women's national ice hockey team players Fanuza Kadirova and Liana Ganeyeva, Gorny slowly became increasingly competitive within the league, improving to 12 wins in 2018–19. Williams, for her part, scored her first two Russian goals in a win over Biryusa Krasnoyarsk on October 18, 2018, then added key goals to help the squad defeat perennially-strong Tornado Dmitrov and Dinamo Saint Petersburg over the following two weekends. In all, she finished her rookie year in Russia with ten goals, tied for second-most on SK Gorny, while her 19 points ranked 38th across the entire league. Williams' exploits merited a spot in the ZhHL's All-Star Game, played on January 13, 2019, in Nizhnekamsk. With the SK Gorny trio of Williams, Rafter, and Kadirova each scoring a goal in the contest, the West downed the East 4–2.\nThe following season, both Williams and SK Gorny improved. The team contended for a playoff berth until the end of the year, thanks in part to the addition of Russian national player Alexandra Vafina, who joined from SKIF Nizhny Novgorod. SK Gorny ultimately finished the regular season in fifth place, three points behind Biryusa for the final spot, and the player bumped up her stats production to 11 goals (14th in the league) and 22 points (16th). She picked up an assist in arguably SK Gorny's biggest win, a 2–1 overtime victory against eventual league champion, the Shenzhen KRS Vanke Rays, late in the season, and notched a professional-career-best four points (on two goals and two assists) in a season-opening rout of SKSO Yekaterinburg.\nWilliams participated in her second straight ZhHL All-Star Game on January 12, 2020, in Moscow, although her Team West dropped a 4–1 decision to Team East.\nEWHL (2020–2022).\nSK Gorny ran into financial difficulties late in the 2020 offseason and unexpectedly folded ahead of the 2020–21 ZhHL season, leaving Williams to scramble for a team. She ultimately signed in the European Women's Hockey League (EWHL) with the women's representative team of KMH Budapest for the 2020–21 EWHL season, despite feeling \"really sad to have to leave\" Russia. Playing on a line with Réka Dabasi and Hungary's best goal-scorer, Alexandra Huszák, she led the league in points and assists in her debut season with KMH, scoring 9 goals and 22 assists for 31 points in fifteen games and recording a league-leading +28 plus–minus. Her contributions helped KMH claim their third consecutive EWHL Championship in 2021. \nWhen she first signed with KMH, Williams planned to return to Russia after playing six months in Hungary but she was soon offered a place on the Hungarian national team. After consideration, she accepted the national team offer, which required that she become naturalized; she was required to play in Hungary for at least two years as a stipulation of citizenship, which prompted her to remain with KMH Budapest through the 2021–22 season. \nWilliams' second season with KMH was not quite as explosive as her first, though she still managed 13 goals and 14 assists for 27 points in eighteen games, ranking fourth on the team and sixth in the league for regular season points. KMH Budapest claimed the EWHL Championship title again in 2022, bolstered by a goal and an assist from Williams in the playoffs. Her 8 points scored across the five games of the EWHL Super Cup were good for eighth place out of all players in the tournament and she tied four other players to rank fourth for assists, with 5. Led by the scoring of Williams and Rhyen McGill, KMH Budapest won the 2022 EWHL Super Cup. \nZhHL (2022–).\nAfter her requisite two seasons in Hungary were finished, Williams explored opportunities to play elsewhere, including returning to the United States to play in the PHF, prior to the 2022–23 season. Ultimately, her love for Russia coupled with a two-year contract from Dinamo-Neva St. Petersburg prompted her to return to the ZhHL. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Williams was the only American or Hungarian citizen to join the Zhenskaya Hockey League for the 2022–23 season and the only North American-born player to sign with a Russian team; the other four North American-born players signed with the league’s sole Chinese team, Shenzhen KRS. She joined a group of less than ten American ice hockey players who opted play for premier Russian teams despite warnings from the United States Department of State urging all Americans to leave Russia.\nInternational play.\nWinter Universiade.\nWilliams was selected as a member of the United States National University Team, which competes at the Winter Universiade, during both of her ACHA seasons, and also named an alternate captain each time.\nThe 2013 edition of the tournament, played in Trentino, Italy resulted in a bronze medal for Williams and Team USA after a third-place game win over Japan - the first-ever podium finish for an American women's team at the event and the first for the U.S. men or women in USA Hockey's modern era of participation (since 2001). Williams' contributions to the success were significant – she assisted on a late clinching goal by Katie Augustine in the team's biggest win, a 4–2 victory over a Russia team featuring several Russia women's national ice hockey team members to open the tournament. In the bronze medal match against Japan, Williams again assisted Augustine for the go-ahead goal early in the third period, then scored in the waning moments of the 3–1 victory.\nAlthough the 2015 version of the team was unable to follow up that success and was quickly knocked out of contention at the 2015 tournament in Granada, Spain, Williams did provide one of the squad's signature moments. During a match against Kazakhstan in the 5th through 7th place consolation round robin, Team USA found itself trailing 2–1 in the last three minutes of the game. Williams then scooped up a loose puck near center ice, carried in herself and scored from the bottom of the left circle with 2:37 remaining. The U.S. went on to win in overtime, a result that eventually allowed the team to finish fifth. Williams scored a pair of goals and added four assists to tie for the team scoring lead.\nPersonal life.\nWilliams was born in Crete, Illinois, United States, a village situated about south of Chicago in the Chicago metropolitan area. A citizen of the United States by birth, she gained multiple citizenship after becoming a naturalized Hungarian citizen in 2021.\nWhen she began playing in the ZhHL in 2018, she \"fell in love with the country of Russia\" and learned the Russian language. \nWilliams is the founder of Hockey Worldwide, an ice hockey training and coaching organization based in Crete, Illinois that produces on-ice camps and off-ice training programs. \nCareer statistics.\nRegular season and playoffs.\nSources: "

Mickelson made four bogeys over his first six holes before rebounding with four birdies on the back nine. Rory McIlroy, who won by eight shots the last time the tournament was held at Kiawah Island in 2012, shot a three-over 75 and was tied for 77th after the first 18 holes.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, May 21, 2021\"\nPhil Mickelson made five birdies over his last nine holes, including a 23-foot putt on the ninth (his 18th), to share the 36-hole lead with Louis Oosthuizen at five-under. At the age of 50, Mickelson became the oldest player to lead the PGA Championship after the second round since Sam Snead in 1966. He also became the sixth player to hold the lead in a major championship in four different decades.\nOosthuizen was five-under on his round before making his only bogey at the 18th to fall into a tie with Mickelson. Two-time champion Brooks Koepka made two eagles and got into a share of the lead at six-under before bogeys at the 15th and 17th; he shot 71 (−1) to finish a shot off the lead.\nMasters champion Hideki Matsuyama was also five-under for the round and one back before making bogey on 18. His four-under 68 tied Oosthuizen for lowest round of the day. First-round leader Corey Conners bogeyed five of his first six holes and shot 75 (+3) to fall into a tie for seventh place, three shots back.\nThe 36-hole cut came at 149 (+5). Notables to miss the cut included Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas, the two top players on the World Golf Rankings, as well as Cameron Tringale, who began the round inside the top 10 but shot 10-over 82 after suffering through a 12-over-par 48 on the back nine Friday (his front nine). Tringale rebounded with a 2-under 34 on the front, but the cut was 5-over and he missed by three.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, May 22, 2021\"\nPhil Mickelson, tied for the lead at the start of the round, went four-under on the front nine and added another birdie on the 10th to open up a five-shot lead at 10-under. At the 12th, he hit his tee shot into a sandy area and had to chip out into the fairway, making his first bogey in 20 holes. His drive on the 13th went into the water hazard to the right of the fairway, leading to a double-bogey that dropped his lead to just one shot. He made par on his last five holes to finish with a two-under round of 70 and seven-under for the tournament.\nBrooks Koepka, meanwhile, holed birdie putts from 11 feet on the 10th and 20 feet on the 12th and was three-under on the back nine to tie Mickelson at seven-under. At the 18th, however, he failed to get up-and-down from behind the green and made bogey to fall to six-under, one behind Mickelson.\nLouis Oosthuizen, playing in the final group with Mickelson, also drove into the water on 13 and made bogey, then three-putted from 25 feet on the 17th for another bogey. He shot even-par 72 and finished two back of the lead at five-under.\nAt 50, Mickelson became the oldest 54-hole leader in PGA Championship history, and the oldest in any major since Tom Watson at the 2009 Open Championship.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, May 23, 2021\"\nSummary.\nPhil Mickelson, at the age of 50, became the oldest golfer to win a major championship, shooting a one-over 73 to finish two shots ahead of Brooks Koepka and Louis Oosthuizen.\nMickelson began the round with a one-shot lead over Koepka, but fell from atop the leaderboard after making bogey on the first while Koepka made birdie to grab the lead.\nMickelson regained the lead with a birdie on the par-five second hole as Koepka suffered a double-bogey. At the par-three fifth, Mickelson found a sandy area off the tee but holed his shot for a birdie. Even-par making the turn, he led Koepka and Oosthuizen by two.\nMickelson extended his lead on the 10th, holing a 12-foot putt for birdie. When Koepka made bogey on both 10 and 11, Mickelson opened up a four-shot lead. Oosthuizen, meanwhile, fell from contention after hitting his third shot on the 13th into the water and making double-bogey. He came back with a birdie at the par-five 16th and shot 73, finishing at four-under for the tournament.\nKoepka was four-over between holes 7-13 before making birdies on the 15th and 16th, joining Oosthuizen at four-under after a two-over 74. Mickelson saw his lead cut in half after also finding the water with his approach on 13, settling for a bogey before dropping another shot on the 14th. At the 16th, he hit a 366-yard drive, the longest of any player on that hole all tournament, and got up-and-down from over the green for a birdie to get to seven-under. Despite making a bogey on the par-three 17th after having to chop out of thick rough, he tapped in for par on the 18th to win his second PGA Championship and sixth major championship.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nMedia.\nESPN and CBS have the media rights to the 2021 PGA Championship.

        "text": "Patrick Carr (born September 22, 1995) is an American football running back who plays for the Seamen Milano in the European League of Football. Carr signed with the Seattle Seahawks as an undrafted free agent following the 2020 NFL Draft. He has also been a member of the Ottawa Redblacks of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He played college football for the Colorado Buffaloes and the Houston Cougars.\nEarly years.\nCarr played tailback for The Woodlands High School in The Woodlands, Texas. Wearing jersey #1, Carr was a four-year letterer and a three-year starter for the Highlanders football team. During his career, he rushed for 5,202 yards and 51 touchdowns, breaking the previous school record made by future NFL player Daniel Lasco. He received multiple honors, including All-County Sophomore MVP, second-team all-state, District Most Valuable Player, and first-team all-district at some point in his high school career. Carr was ranked the 93rd best player in the nation and was listed as a 4-star recruit by the end of his senior season. He committed to the University of Colorado over offers from Arkansas, Arizona State, Iowa, Kentucky, Oklahoma State, Oregon, Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech, TCU, and Wake Forest. Carr also played football alongside fellow NFL player Antoine Winfield Jr., who played safety for The Woodlands.\nHe was also a four-year letterer in track, where he received state honors in the 100-meter dash, the 4x100 relay race, the 4x200 relay race, and the field event long jump. Carr additionally lettered in soccer as a freshman but left the team before the end of the season to focus on other sports.\nCollege career.\nCarr played in all 12 games as a true freshman for the Colorado Buffaloes and had 272 rushing yards on 66 carries with four touchdowns. Carr finished the season being named Colorado's freshman player of the year and was on the all-NCAA 2nd team freshman roster. However, Carr transferred to the University of Houston following a family incident that left him wanting to return to his hometown.\nAfter sitting out a season due to NCAA transfer regulations, Carr played sparingly as a reserve tailback for the Houston Cougars, rushing 26 yards on 4 carries in his sophomore year. He was bumped to a shared starting position with Mulbah Car as a junior, seeing time in all games and leading his team in rushing yards with 868 yards for 5 touchdowns on 151 carries, averaging 5.7 yards per carry. He reclaimed his starting role at the beginning of his senior year, but ended up missing most of the season due to injury and was only able to start three games. Regardless, he recorded 380 yards and 5 touchdowns on 67 carries, again averaging 5.7 yards per carry. He was also a selection for the 2017-2018 All-American academic team. He finished his career with 1,546 yards for 13 touchdowns on 227 carries, averaging 6.0 yards per carry.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nAlthough Carr ultimately went undrafted, he agreed to sign with the Seattle Seahawks hours following the 2020 NFL Draft. He officially signed with the team on May 4, 2020. He was waived on July 26, 2020, but was re-signed on August 14, 2020. He was waived/injured on August 31, 2020, and subsequently reverted to the team's injured reserve list the next day.\nOttawa Redblacks.\nOn October 10, 2021, Carr signed with the Ottawa Redblacks of the Canadian Football League (CFL). On January 13, 2022, he was released by the Redblacks following the 2021 season.\nSeamen Milano.\nOn Novembre 27, 2023, Carr signed with the Seamen Milano, italian side of the European League of Football. He will play with the italian franchise in the 2024 season."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Buccaneers represent East Tennessee State University in the NCAA's Southern Conference.\nEast Tennessee began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1918. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but East Tennessee State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2023–24 season."

        "title": "Maryland–Navy lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Maryland–Navy lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between the Maryland Terrapins and Navy Midshipmen. Hailing from College Park and Annapolis, the state rivals have another historical series in college football, known as the Crab Bowl Classic. In lacrosse, the teams first met in 1924 and have met annually since 1927, aside from brief interruptions due to World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to Maryland upgrading its club team to varsity in 1924, the teams met seven additional times, with Navy winning five of those. However, these do not count in the official record. Traditionally taking place in either April or May, the game has been moved up to the earlier months of the season to accommodate the teams' increasing difficulty to schedule non-conference games, compounded by the expansion of the Patriot League and Maryland's decision to join the Big Ten Conference. Despite concern that the series may have to be postponed indefinitely, the teams have maintain the annual series, though it has at times been played mid-week rather than as the weekend headliner.\nNavy owns 17 national championships and Maryland claims 13, four of which (1973, 1975, 2017, 2022) have come in the NCAA Division I Tournament era. The teams rank No. 1 and No. 2 in terms of the number of first team All-Americans produced, while all four of the winningest head coaches by percentage roamed the sidelines of the two schools. The rivalry is the second-longest in Terps history, only trailing its series with Johns Hopkins. On Navy's side, the rivalry is also its second-longest series, only trailing its all-sports rivals Army. Through 2020, Maryland leads the series 60–33–1.\nSeries history.\nEarly years (1920s through 1960s).\nThe first game in series history was played in Washington, D.C. in 1924. Maryland won by two goals. A three-year gap would take place before the next meeting, which then gained an annual spot on the schools' schedules. Maryland dominated early on, winning all but four contests before the series went on hiatus in 1941. The teams would meet again in 1943, before resuming on annual basis for good in 1946. After five straight Maryland victories, Navy embarked on its most successful period in both the rivalry and program history. The 1960s featured eight straight national titles for the Midshipmen, from 1960 to 1967. The last of these would be shared with their rivals from College Park and Johns Hopkins, though the meeting between the two went the way of Navy. Each game during this stretch was won by the Midshipmen until Maryland ended the streak in 1968.\nEarly NCAA era (1970s through 1990s).\nThe introduction of the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship in 1971 brought new stakes to the rivalry. During the regular season, Navy downed the Terps 10–5 at home, but would lose a Final Four rematch on the road. Maryland held on to a four-goal halftime lead to advance to the inaugural title game, which they would lose to Cornell. The current USILA polling system began in 1973, with #4 UMD taking the first ranked meeting over the #4 Midshipmen. This would began a stretch of 15 straight games with the two programs ranked in the Top 10 and 28 consecutive with both ranked in the polls. As of 2020, 43 of 52 meetings since the introduction of the polls have been between two ranked teams.\nThe 1970s would feature three more postseason meetings, all won by Maryland. In 1975, the teams would meet for a national title. In the Final Four, Maryland had blown out Washington &amp; Lee 15–5, despite being questioned for their inclusion in the tournament, while Navy upset the number 1 seed, Cornell. After grabbing a five-goal lead after the first quarter, the Midshipmen held on after a furious rally from the Big Red. The final was the 50th all-time meeting between the Terps and Navy, held at Homewood Field, the home field of their mutual rival Johns Hopkins. Though the Midshipmen upset Maryland during the regular season matchup, the Terps would get revenge. After a combined 11 goal first period, Maryland would pull ahead before halftime with a 9–6 lead. The third quarter featured eight more goals and Maryland carried a 13–10 advantage into the fourth. Using seven goals, the Terps pulled away to win 20–13, the highest scoring game in the series since 34 goals were scored in a 1962 Navy victory. 120 total shots were launched during the game, the second-most of the 1975 tournament. The game remains tied for the second-highest all-time game between the two programs and the highest-scoring title game in NCAA history. In the title game, Frank Urso led the Terps with five goals, pushing him over the 100 goal mark, while Bob DeSimone led the Midshipmen with four.\n1976 would feature a title game rematch in the Final Four, with 1-seeded Maryland dominating Navy 22–11, tying the previous postseason game with 33 goals scored. The Terps blitzed Navy in the first quarter, hanging 10 goals on the Midshipmen. While Navy played the rest of the game fairly evenly with the Terps, only being outscored 12–10, the initial surge had put the game out of reach. Ed Mullen scored 7 for undefeated Maryland, which would be dealt its first and only loss of the season in the national championship game by 16–0 Cornell. Maryland would win each of the next three meetings against Navy prior to their most recent postseason meeting in 1979. Held in College Park, the Final Four game featured #2 Maryland and #3 Navy. Despite outshooting the Terps, Navy was unable to overcome a 7–4 halftime deficit and would fall 15–10. Maryland would again fall in the title game, this time to fellow state rival Johns Hopkins.\nThe following year, Navy would capture its first victory over the Terps in eight tries. The Midshipmen would win four of the next six after their 1979 postseason defeat. After several more years of fierce battles, a 1993 loss to Maryland would portend poor fortunes for Navy in the years to come. From that game, Maryland won 11 straight matchups. Several games early in the streak were convincing UMD victories, including an eight-goal victory in 1995 and a dominant 21–7 victory in 1998. The 14 goal margin marks the largest differential in series history. However, that game would shift the series to an even more bitter stretch for Navy. The next four meetings would all end in the same score: six to five. The Midshipmen came close each time but were unable to come out with a victory. The 1996 meeting featured a late rally by Navy to dig themselves out of a four-goal hole, but just fell short of upsetting the #2 Terps, losing 11 to 10. During this 11 game streak, six of the losses came by just a single goal, amplifying the heartbreak. UMD ended the 1990s with a 9 to 1 advantage for the decade, their best ever in terms of winning percentage in the rivalry to that point.\nRecent years (2000s to present).\nIn 2004, Navy overcame their struggles against their rivals, upsetting #1 Maryland on the road. The Midshipmen would carry that momentum throughout the season, ultimately finishing as the national runner-up. In addition to that victory, Navy would prevail in four of the next five meetings. In 2005, before a record Annapolis crowd of 14,124 attended the rivalry, with Navy pulling out a 9–8 victory with a Graham Gill goal with 14 seconds left in the game. This record would be topped two years later and again in 2009 when 15,109 fans attended, also counting as the fifth most-attended home Navy lacrosse game, only trailing its similar rivalry matchup with Johns Hopkins. The only Maryland win during this stretch was an 8–7 double overtime thriller in Annapolis.\nWhile the teams split the 2000s at five victories apiece, the narrative would change in the next decade. Maryland would win all 10 games in the 2010s; the current streak is the second longest in series history. Intrigue was increased with the hiring of current Maryland head coach John Tillman, who spent 12 seasons as an assistant with Navy. The 2016 matchup was the first since 2008 to feature two Top 10 teams. With a balanced scoring attack, the Terps defeated #7 Navy 10–5 in College Park. The most recent game was won by Maryland, a 14 to 9 victory that required a four-goal stretch in the final quarter to pull away from their rivals, pushing Tillman's record against the Midshipmen to a perfect 9 and 0. Significantly in 2020, the game was not played for the first time since World War II. Initially postponed due to a norovirus outbreak among members of the Naval Academy team, the rescheduled game was cancelled along with the entire season by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "title": "Wimbledon Town Hall",
        "text": "Wimbledon Town Hall is a municipal building in The Broadway, Wimbledon, London. It is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory.\nThe building was commissioned to replace the aging public offices on the same site which had been designed by Thomas Goodchild in the Italianate style and completed in 1878. After the area became an urban district in 1894 and then a municipal borough in 1905, civic leaders decided that the old public offices were inadequate for their needs and should be demolished to make way for a new building.\nThe new building, which was designed by Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope in the Classical style, was officially opened by Prince George on 5 November 1931. Edward Foster VC, who had been born in Streatham, was present for the ceremony. The design involved a symmetrical frontage with eleven bays at the junction of Queen's Road and the Broadway; the outer bays projected forward slightly and incorporated huge Doric order pilasters, while the central section of three bays featured a portico flanked by Doric order columns and pilasters on the ground floor with the borough coat of arms above; there were square-headed windows in all the bays on the first floor with a mansard roof above. The complex originally included an assembly hall at the rear and a \"Kinema\" for showing silent films; the complex was equipped with a pipe organ made by John Compton allowing it to host a regular programme of concerts by the Wimbledon Symphony Orchestra.\nDuring the Second World War, a civil defence control centre was installed in the basement and observation posts were placed on the roof. The town hall continued to be used as a public venue and concert performers included the contralto singer, Kathleen Ferrier, who made an appearance on 25 April 1950.\nThe building served as the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Wimbledon for much of the 20th century and continued to serve as the local seat of government of the enlarged London Borough of Merton after it was formed in 1965. However, it became surplus to requirements after the council moved to Crown House in Morden in 1985. Following three planning inquiries, the assembly hall at the rear was demolished in the late 1980s, to make way for the Centre Court Shopping Centre. This left only the front range in place, which itself was converted for retail use to the designs of the Building Design Partnership in 1990. The groceries retailer, Tesco, moved into the ground floor of former front range of the town hall while the clothing business, H&amp;M, took the first floor a few years later."

He previously played for the Oregon Ducks.\nEarly life and high school career.\nWalker lived in Bayside Queens, New York until age 11, when his family moved to Sanford, Florida. Due to Walker's height, in 5th grade his father decided to make him play with the 7th and 8th grade AAU Panthers traveling team. As a freshman, Walker played basketball for Seminole High School in Sanford. For his next two years, he transferred to Orlando Christian Prep in Orlando, Florida, where played with five-star recruit Nassir Little and won back-to-back Class 3A state titles and won MVP honors in both championship games. After his junior season, Walker emerged as a top player in his class with his travel team, Each 1 Teach 1. As a senior, he began playing for Oak Ridge High School in Orlando, averaging 15.8 points, 13.8 rebounds and 3.8 blocks per game. Walker was named \"Orlando Sentinel\" Player of the Year and Class 9A Player of the Year and was the runner-up to Vernon Carey Jr. for the Florida Mr. Basketball award. He was selected to play in the Jordan Brand Classic in April 2019.\nRecruiting.\nWalker was heavily recruited by most of NCAA's top schools after back to back state championships and a breakout summer with E1T1 Elite. On November 21, 2018, Walker committed to play college basketball for Oregon over his other top offers, LSU and Miami (Florida). He was considered a five-star recruit by ESPN and Rivals and a four-star recruit by 247Sports.\nCollege career.\nOregon.\nOn December 7, 2019, Walker made his first career start, due to a leg injury to Shakur Juiston, and scored a freshman season-high 18 points in an 89–64 win over Hawaii. He suffered a back injury against Alabama State on December 29. Walker played in his next game versus Colorado, before being sidelined with back and knee injuries until January 16, 2020. As a freshman, he averaged four points and 2.5 rebounds in 14.9 minutes per game. On July 1, Walker announced that he was transferring from Oregon to be closer to home.\nUCF.\nOn July 6, 2020, Walker announced that he was transferring to UCF. He made the decision to be closer to elderly and ailing family during the COVID-19 pandemic. He was granted a waiver for immediate eligibility on November 23. Walker became the first five-star recruit to ever play for UCF. As a sophomore, Walker averaged 7.0 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per game.

        "title": "Johns Hopkins–Virginia lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Johns Hopkins–Virginia lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays and Virginia Cavaliers. The teams compete for the Doyle Smith Cup, which was first awarded in 2006. Edward Doyle Smith Jr., the only inductee to the U.S. Lacrosse Hall of Fame to have never competed in the sport, was a team manager and statistician at Johns Hopkins for five years before becoming UVA's first assistant sports information director, which he held for 31 seasons. Smith is also credited with the standardization of game statistics for lacrosse at the national level, twice receiving the USILA Man of the Year Award.\nThe rivalry features two of the three most dominant programs in lacrosse history, with the Jays and Cavaliers winning nine and seven national titles respectively since the creation of the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. The series has contained 16 NCAA postseason matchups, with Hopkins leading those matches 10–6. An annual fixture from 1948 to 2019, Johns Hopkins leads the series 62–32–1 through 2024 thanks largely to its early dominance, but Virginia has held the upper hand, 20–14, since 1994. \nThese rivals have met three times to decide national titles, with the Cavaliers defeating the Blue Jays for their first and third NCAA championships (in 1972 and in 2003) in hotly contested matches, and Johns Hopkins narrowly defeating Virginia in 1980 (in two overtimes) for their third consecutive and fourth overall NCAA championship.\nSeries history.\nPre-NCAA era (1900s to 1970s).\nThe teams first squared off in 1904, meeting twice during the season. At this time, lacrosse was not recognized as a varsity sport at Virginia. A 22 year gap would follow before playing again during the second \"official\" year of lacrosse for the Cavs. These six early games all resulted in large Hopkins victories, as the Jays outscored UVA by a margin of 72–4. The series would resume in 1948 and become an annual game. In 1952, the Cavaliers beat Hopkins for the first time, winning a narrow 13–12 game. Virginia would claim its first national championship that season, heralding the programs arrival at the top of the sport. After the win in Baltimore, the teams met the following season in Charlottesville for the inaugural match at home for the Cavs against the Jays. Virginia would again triumph, but would not notch another win until 1963. Through the 1969 season, the series was firmly under Hopkins' control, as they held a 24–3–1 advantage against their southern rival.\nIncreasing national significance (1970s to 1990s).\nThe 1972 season was a crucial one in the history of the rivalry. Hopkins had taken the regular season matchup but the teams would meet again for the first time in the NCAA Division I Championship. This would be one of an NCAA-record 16 games played between the programs in the tournament. This game would take place with high stakes as the second-ever national title championship. Led by head coach Glenn Thiel, the Cavaliers knocked off favored Johns Hopkins by a 13–12 score before 7,000 spectators at Byrd Stadium. Outshooting the Jays 44 to 33 over the course of the contest, Virginia led at halftime 7 to 5. After a strong third quarter by the Blue Jays, the Cavs used a five goal performance in the final 15 minutes to prevail. However, Jack Thomas had a chance to tie with 12 seconds remaining but JHU coach Bob Scott called time out with six seconds to go, costing the Jays' one-on-one opportunity. A key element of the bitterness felt by the defeated Hopkins players was that UVA should not have been selected for the tournament in the first place, as they had already lost thrice in the regular season, including to the Jays. The following year, the teams would again meet for a postseason rematch, this time won by Johns Hopkins in the Final Four, by way of four goals from Rick Kowalchuk and three from Franz Wittelsberger. The regular season meeting was also significant as the first between the schools when ranked #1 and #2, incidentally, in the inaugural year of the polls.\nAnother important period began in 1979, as JHU and UVA played in four consecutive tournaments. The 1979 contest went to Hopkins, as they surged for a seven goal third quarter to down UVA in the Final Four. The next year they met in the national title for the second time. This contest would go the way of JHU this time. In a thrilling affair, Hopkins won from a Jeff Harris finish after two overtimes, the only championship game to extend beyond a single overtime period in NCAA history. The 1981 and 1982 bouts would be similar affairs, as both Final Four games ended with four goal Hopkins victories. Three years later, JHU would again end the Cavaliers' season in the Final Four, overcoming an early 5 to 0 deficit. In 1988, UVA would end a six game postseason losing streak to Hopkins, upsetting them in the quarterfinals behind five Chase Monroe goals. A mid-game confrontation between Monroe and teammate Quint Kessenich, a future ESPN and ABC sports analyst, was also noted.\nThe Blue Jays generally held the advantage during this stretch of the rivalry's history, only dropping two games between UVA's 1972 title win and a 1987 regular season victory by Virginia. However, the series was a must-see fixture, with both teams ranked in the Top 10 of the polls, and often the Top 5. The first game since the introduction of the weekly polls in 1972 to not feature Top 10 teams was in 2004, in which Virginia entered the game ranked #17. Indeed, each game of the rivalry's modern history has occurred between two ranked teams, as of 2020.\nDom Starsia flips the narrative (1990s to 2010s).\nLegendary UVA head coach Dom Starsia arrived in Charlottesville by way of Brown in 1993. His first season ended the way of many recent Cavaliers teams – a loss to Hopkins in the postseason, this time in the quarterfinals. The next year, Starsia would earn his first against the Jays, one of 19 that he would notch against his Baltimore foe. His 19–13 record in the rivalry marks him as the only UVA coach to end his tenure with a winning percentage against JHU. In 1996, Starsia's Cavs, led by tournament Most Outstanding Player Michael Watson, downed Hopkins in the Final Four. The 1999 UVA team would win its first national championship in 27 years after beating the #2 Jays by a score of 16–10 in the Final Four. The Cavaliers would also triumph in each of the next three games, pushing their winning steak to a then-record four. In 2003, the two would square off in their first title game matchup since 1980. Playing at M&amp;T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, #2 Virginia would beat #1 Johns Hopkins in their own backyard by a 9–7 score. Goalie Tillman Johnson, UVA's all-time saves leader at 204, was named tournament MOP after saving 13 Hopkins shots.\nIn addition to the annual regular season game, the programs would meet in two additional postseason games before the end of the decade. In the 2005 NCAA tournament, JHU would beat their rivals 9–8 in overtime to advance to the national title game, which they would win over Duke to claim their first championship in 18 years. Four years later, the Cavaliers routed Hopkins 19 to 8 behind five Shamel Bratton goals for the worst postseason defeat in Blue Jays history. Virginia advanced to their fourth Final Four in five years and secured the 300th career victory for Starsia. The first game played for the Doyle Smith Cup occurred in 2006, won by a 12–6 score by #1 Virginia. Since the introduction of the trophy, UVA leads the series 10 to 7. Beginning in this period, the increasing importance of recruiting rankings in collegiate lacrosse added a new dimension to the rivalry, due to the national brand presence for the historic powers.\nRecent years (2010 to present).\nIn 2011, Johns Hopkins snapped a six game skid to Virginia with a 12–11 victory. One new element of the rivalry began in 2014, when attackman Wells Stanwick, younger brother of former Cavaliers star Steele Stanwick, signed with the Blue Jays. In both the 2014 and 2015 tournaments, unseeded Hopkins defeated the Cavaliers in Charlottesville in the first round. The 2014 postseason contest enabled JHU head coach Dave Pietramala to tie former coach Bob Scott for the most career victories at the university. In 2018, Hopkins overcame a seven goal halftime deficit to stun UVA at Klockner Stadium. The most recent meeting in 2019 was the 94th of the rivalry's history. A five goal victory for the Cavaliers stretched their recent advantage to 19 of the last 31 meetings. The Blue Jays ended the 2010s with a 7–5 advantage, including five overtime games in eight meetings with four straight in regular season games. In 2020, the series was scheduled for interruption for the first time since it became an annual fixture in 1948. After Johns Hopkins joined the Big Ten Conference for men's lacrosse in 2015, it has had increasing difficulty to maintain all of its historical rivalries in conjunction with a slate of conference games; Hopkins also had to temporarily cancel its series with Navy for the 2018 and 2019 seasons for similar reasons.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "title": "1993 Women's Cricket World Cup final",
        "text": "The 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup Final was a one-day cricket match between England and New Zealand played on 1 August 1993 at Lord's in London, England. It marked the culmination of the 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup, the fifth edition of the tournament. England won the final by 67 runs, clinching their second World Cup title; their first since the inaugural tournament in 1973. It was England's third appearance in a World Cup final, while New Zealand made their debut at this stage of the tournament.\nNew Zealand remained unbeaten through the round-robin league stage of the tournament, while England only lost once: to New Zealand. They finished first and second in the league to qualify directly for the final. New Zealand were considered slight favourites for the final. The New Zealand captain, Sarah Illingworth, won the toss, and opted to field first. England scored patiently throughout most of their innings; Jan Brittin and Carole Hodges had a partnership of 85, before runs were added more quickly towards the end, led by 38 runs from 33 balls by Jo Chamberlain. England finished on 195 for five. In their response, New Zealand regularly lost wickets. The dismissal of Debbie Hockley just before the tea interval was identified as a key moment for England, who eventually bowled New Zealand out for 128 to secure victory. Chamberlain was named as player of the match, for her all-round performance.\nBackground.\nThe 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup was the fifth Women's Cricket World Cup. The first had been held in 1973, pre-dating the first men's Cricket World Cup by two years. The 1993 tournament featured eight teams; Australia, Denmark, England, India, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand and the West Indies. It took place between 20 July and 1 August, featuring 29 matches over 13 days. England had won the first World Cup on home soil, before Australia won each of the next three, beating England in the 1982 and 1988 finals.\nRoute to the final.\nEach team played seven matches during the round-robin stage of the tournament, facing each other once. The top two teams would progress directly to the final. England started their campaign against Denmark. Aided by a hat-trick from Carole Hodges—both the first by an Englishwoman in international cricket, and the first at any Women's World Cup—England won by 239 runs; at the time, the second-biggest winning margin in Women's One Day International cricket. In their second match, they faced New Zealand, who only managed to score 127 runs batting first. However, in response, New Zealand enacted five run outs to help secure a 25-run victory. The New Zealand captain, Sarah Illingworth recalled: \"As captain that day I felt as if I knew what was going to happen before it did in the field. [It was the] best fielding performance I’ve ever been involved in.\" The English cricket writer, Raf Nicholson, blamed England rather than praised New Zealand, saying that England \"threw away the game with five suicidal run-outs and unnecessary slogging in between\". England subsequently beat Ireland by 162 runs—during which Hodges and Helen Plimmer both scored centuries for England—and narrowly defeated India, who had only needed four runs to win when their last batter was dismissed. Their results meant that England had to beat Australia to give themselves a realistic chance of reaching the final. England scored 208 for five; aided by another century from Hodges, and then five wickets by Gill Smith helped England to bowl Australia out for 165. England convincingly won their final two group matches; a four-wicket win over the West Indies, with more than 13 overs remaining, and a 133-run win over the Netherlands.\nNew Zealand opened their tournament against Ireland, achieving a seven-wicket win after restricting the Irish to 82 for six from their reduced allocation of 39 overs. After beating England in their second match, New Zealand secured another large victory, defeating Denmark by nine wickets after bowling them out for 93 runs. New Zealand's bowlers dominated again in the next match: Jennifer Turner took five wickets and conceded only five runs as the Netherlands were bowled out for 40, at the time the third-lowest score in Women's One Day Internationals. During New Zealand's next match, a seven-wicket win over the West Indies, Julie Harris took New Zealand's first hat-trick in Women's One Day Internationals. In their penultimate group match, New Zealand were restricted to 154 runs by India, but three run outs and economic bowling helped them to a 42-run victory. New Zealand faced Australia in their final group match: victory would ensure them a place in the final, but a loss would leave Australia, England and New Zealand all on the same number of points, and run rate would have to be used to determine which teams reached the final. No such tie-breaker was needed; New Zealand bowled Australia out for 77 runs, which as of 2020 remains their lowest total in Women's One Day Internationals. New Zealand reached their target without loss to win by ten wickets. Having won all of their matches, New Zealand finished top of the league on 28 points, while England finished second with 24 points.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe final was played on a \"clear and bright\" day at Lord's cricket ground in London. Although Lord's is famously described as \"the home of cricket\", it was only the third time that a women's One Day International had been played at the ground. At the time of the match, women were not allowed to be members of the Marylebone Cricket Club (the MCC; who owned the ground), nor were they allowed in the pavilion. The BBC made a late schedule change to broadcast the match live on \"Grandstand\", where it attracted 2.5 million viewers. The match began at 10:45 BST, and was played in front of a crowd of around 5,000 people, who were all on one side of the ground, as the MCC kept the other side closed.\nThe New Zealand captain, Illingworth, won the toss and chose to field first. Jan Brittin and Wendy Watson opened the batting for England; Watson was dropped in the first over, but only added five runs before being bowled by Sarah McLauchlan. That wicket brought Hodges to the crease: Brittin and Hodges were the leading run-scorers during the tournament, and Alan Lee of \"The Times\" described their partnership as \"accomplished and assured\" as they patiently put on 85 runs together. During her innings, Brittin became the first player to score 1,000 runs in Women's World Cup matches. Brittin was dismissed 15 minutes before lunch, caught at mid-wicket by Karen Gunn off the bowling of McLauchlan for 48 runs, leaving England 96 for two. After the wicket, Hodges and Plimmer scored 18 runs in just under 10 overs before both were dismissed in quick succession: Hodges was stumped by Illingworth off the bowling of Catherine Campbell for 45, while Plimmer was run out for 11. Their wickets brought Jo Chamberlain and Barbara Daniels in to bat. The pair played more positively, working the ball into gaps in the field and taking quick singles. Chamberlain was dropped when she had scored seven runs: in all, New Zealand dropped four catches during the final, in stark contrast to the excellent fielding that had earned them plaudits during the group stage. Chamberlain scored 38 runs from 33 deliveries before missing the ball while aiming a big shot at the Tavern Stand, and being bowled by Julie Harris. She was given a standing ovation by the MCC members as she walked off the pitch. Daniels and Karen Smithies added another 20 runs in the final few overs to take England to 195 for five: they scored 81 of their 195 runs from the last 12 overs.\nNew Zealand opened the batting with Penny Kinsella and Debbie Hockley; England started with the medium pace bowling of Clare Taylor at one end, and the off spin of Hodges at the other. Writing for \"The Guardian\", Mike Selvey said that the use of Hodges \"at a stroke [rendered] Debbie Hockley both moribund and, with helmet, grill and armguard, faintly ridiculous.\" Kinsella was the first wicket to fall, caught behind by Jane Smit off the bowling of Taylor for 15. Hockley and Kirsty Bond then built a partnership, taking the score on to 51 for one before Chamberlain was introduced into the bowling attack, and Bond was soon \"brilliantly caught by Suzy Kitson at gully\", according to Martin Williamson of \"ESPNcricinfo\". Hockley and Maia Lewis began to rebuild the New Zealand innings, but after adding nine runs in seven overs, the left-handed Chamberlain hit the stumps with a right-arm throw to run out Hockley for 24, a moment identified as the turning point of the match by both Selvey and Taylor. Tea was taken after 30 overs of the New Zealand innings. Shortly thereafter two more wickets fell: Illingworth was caught and bowled by Smithies for 4, while Emily Drumm was caught by Chamberlain off the bowling of Smith for a duck. From 55 for one, New Zealand had collapsed to 71 for five. Lewis and Gunn added 39 runs together, but once Lewis was dismissed for 28, trapped leg before wicket by Smith, New Zealand subsided, and were bowled out for 128. England won by 67 runs, and secured their second World Cup title.\nScorecard.\nUmpires:\nKey\nAftermath.\nChamberlain was selected as the player of the match: in \"The Times\", Lee said that \"she did all but everything\", praising her batting, bowling and fielding performances alike. In \"The Guardian\", Selvey said that she had put in an \"unstinting all-round performance\". The consensus was that New Zealand had been overwhelmed by their nerves in the final; one of the New Zealand players, Campbell said \"We weren't very experienced at finals, and we choked.\" Throughout the group stage, New Zealand had never had to chase more than 96 runs, so their middle and lower order batters had not had much match practice in English conditions. Before the match, England's women had received a good luck message from the England men's team, who had just lost the Ashes to Australia. Smithies, speaking after the victory, aimed a good-natured dig at them; \"Perhaps they could learn a few things from this.\"\nEngland's victory gave women's cricket unprecedented coverage in the English press; it was featured in all the national newspapers, and was even on the front pages of some. There was an item on the win in the BBC Evening News. The England captain, Smithies, reflected that the response surprised her; \"It changed my life completely for about six months ... It lit up women's cricket again.\"\nIn amongst all the plaudits were a few notes of caution; Lee suggested that \"This final illustrated the athleticism of the game and the status to which it can aspire; what is needed now is firmer and more enterprising administration.\" Former England player Sarah Potter said \"Progress has been held back by lack of hard cash and column inches, and buckets of male condescension.\" England failed to reach another World Cup final until 2009, when they once again beat New Zealand. New Zealand faced Australia in the final in both 1997 and 2000; losing the first and winning the second."

        "text": "David Edwards (19 March 1930 – 8 July 2006) is a former Scotland international rugby union player.\nRugby career.\nAmateur career.\nEdwards started his rugby playing while at George Heriot's School. Joining the RAF as part of his National Service he moved to Merseyside. While there he played for Birkenhead Park FC. Upon his return to Edinburgh he joined his school's \"Former Pupils\" team of Heriot's. Edwards played his career here, later becoming captain and then president in the years to follow. Iain Milne described Edwards as an \"uncompromising back row\"\nRugby sevens.\nEdwards was a fast, hard running player and enjoyed an illustrious sevens career with Heriot's.\nWinning:\nProvincial career.\nWhilst with Heriot's he played for Edinburgh District. He played in the 1955–56 Scottish Inter-District Championship season that was decided in the final game versus Glasgow District\nIt would be four years until Edwards would be selected to play for Edinburgh District again in the 1959-60 season. This time his performances on the pitch would lead to a selection in the Scotland team.\nOn 16 November 1960 a combined Glasgow-Edinburgh District side faced the touring South Africa squad. Edwards captained the side losing 16-11, in the process he got badly injured but came back on. In the days that followed the injuries forced him to retire at the age of 30.\nInternational career.\nAfter Edwards's performances in the 1959–60 Scottish Inter-District Championship he was selected to \"lead the pack\" against Ireland only a matter of 3 weeks before his 30th birthday. The match ended in a 6–5 victory to Scotland with Edwards scoring an unconverted try and 5 minutes later Ken Scotland landing a \"neat drop goal\". This was Scotland's first victory in Ireland for 27 years.\nOn Edwards 30th Birthday he played England in what would be a 21–12 defeat.\nIn the April of 1960 Scotland went on the first visit to the Southern Hemisphere by a single home nation and the first short tour by any Test team by going to South Africa. Edwards third and final cap came in this test game which they lost 18–10. Four days later Edwards scored a try versus Griqualand West now known as the Griquas in Kimberley."

While it was not surprising that the Ephs lost many of those games, failing to win any of their first five games was a bit of a setback. Much of the hand-wringing ended when the team trounced Cornell 8–1, beginning a 4-game winning streak to end the season.

The Ephs continued to perform well over the course of the season, winning six of their seven games while playing only once at home. At the end of the season William's victory over Princeton could have given them a claim to the intercollegiate championship, however, Princeton played most of their games against top competition while Williams did not. The win also came in the preliminary time of the schedule when most teams weren't fully ready for play and thus was not given the same weight that a game later in the season would receive. In any event, Williams was able to claim a win over the 1910 Intercollegiate hockey champion, something very few small schools could even hope to accomplish.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Terrapins represent University of Maryland in the NCAA's Big Ten Conference.\nMaryland began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1904. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Maryland's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

The team didn't appear to have lost a step from the squad that had narrowly missed winning a championship the year before, but when they hit the meat of their schedule the team fared poorly.\nThe Greens lost a close decision to Princeton in mid January then had over three weeks before their next contest. When they played Harvard they were in no shape to face the defending champions and lost badly. They found their legs in the next game against Yale, keeping even with the Elis deep into overtime, but the Bulldogs scored the game winner, relegating Dartmouth to second class status for the year.\nThe Greens won their final three games, including a route of Army, to finish with a winning record but the mid-season stumble left the team with a sour taste in its mouth.\nNote: Dartmouth College did not possess a moniker for its athletic teams until the 1920s, however, the university had adopted 'Dartmouth Green' as its school color in 1866.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Equestrian at the 1992 Summer Olympics – Individual jumping",
        "text": "The individual show jumping at the 1992 Summer Olympics took place between 4 and 9 August at the Real Club de Polo de Barcelona. The event was open to men and women. There were 87 competitors from 30 nations. Each nation could have up to 4 riders. The event was won by Ludger Beerbaum of Germany, the nation's second victory in individual jumping (tying the United States for third-most among nations behind France's four and Italy's three). It was the third consecutive Games at which Germany competed that the nation reached the podium in the event—gold in 1936 and bronze in 1952 (with no Games in 1940 or 1944, Germany disinvited in 1948, and either United Team of Germany or separate West Germany and East Germany teams competing from 1956 to 1988). Piet Raymakers earned the Netherlands' first medal in the event with his silver. The United States reached the podium for the third consecutive Games with Norman Dello Joio's bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 19th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900. The team and individual events were interrelated for the first time since 1964.\nEight of the top 13 (including a six-way tie for 7th) riders from the 1988 Games returned: fourth-place finisher Anne Kursinski of the United States, sixth-place finisher Jaime Azcárraga of Mexico, and seventh-place finishers Jan Tops and Jos Lansink of the Netherlands, Nick Skelton of Great Britain, Franke Sloothaak of West Germany (now competing for united Germany), and Markus Fuchs and Thomas Fuchs of Switzerland. The reigning World Champion was Eric Navet of France.\nCroatia, the Philippines, South Africa, and the Virgin Islands each made their debut in the event. Some former Soviet republics competed together as the Unified Team. France competed for the 17th time, most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition underwent a significant format change for the second time in as many Games. For the first time since 1964, the team and individual events overlapped in the use of results. The format expanded to a total of five rounds, now using three rounds for the qualifying round and two rounds for the final. The first two qualifying rounds counted toward the team competition.\nAll riders competed in the first two qualifying rounds. The field was then cut to 56 riders (based on the combined score for the first two rounds) for the third qualifying round, with each nation limited to three riders advancing. The three-round total counted as the qualifying score. Half of the riders (44 of the 87) advanced to the final. Positive scoring was used for each of the qualifying rounds.\nThe final consisted of two rounds. Both rounds used the traditional fault scoring. Only the top 22 (half of the 44 finalists) riders advanced from the first round of the final to the second. The total of the two rounds was used for the final score. A jump-off would be used if necessary to break ties for medal positions; other ties would not be broken.\nResults.\nMartínez (Spain) and Robert (France) did not advance due to the three-rider limit per nation in the final.\nFour riders cleared the first round of the final with no faults: Beerbaum, Raymakers, Dello Joio, and Whitaker. Whitaker had 19.25 faults in the second run. Dello Joio had 4.75 faults in the second run, the fourth-best result in that run to finish third overall (Tops, with 4 faults, had been better in the second run but finished fifth overall with 4.25 faults in the first resulting in a total of 8.25). Beerbaum and Raymakers both finished the second run without any obstacle faults, but Raymakers exceeded the time limit by 0.66 seconds resulting in a quarter-point fault. That timing fault was the difference between the two men as Beerbaum received gold and Raymakers silver."

        "text": "Russian athletes competed at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China, from 4 to 20 February 2022, under the \"Russian Olympic Committee\" designation (using the acronym \"ROC\") due to the consequences of the doping scandal in the country. \nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for four years, after it had been found that data provided by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency had been manipulated by Russian authorities with a goal of protecting athletes involved in its state-sponsored doping scheme. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, on review of Russia's appeal of its case from WADA, ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation. Russia can appeal the decision.\nOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\", after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee. On aftermatch, the IOC announced that the Russian national flag would be substituted by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. It would also be allowed to use team uniforms bearing the words \"Russian Olympic Committee\", or the acronym \"ROC\" would be added.\nOn 15 April 2021, the uniforms for the Russian Olympic Committee athletes were unveiled, featuring the colours of the Russian flag. On 22 April 2021, the replacement for Russia's anthem was approved by the IOC, after an earlier choice of the patriotic Russian song \"Katyusha\" was rejected. A fragment of Pyotr Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 is used.\nTriple gold medalist and eight-time medalist Alexander Bolshunov was the closing ceremony flagbearer.\nOn 19 February, Russian athletes officially set a new record for the total number of medals won, having earned at least 32 and improving on Russia's previous best result in Sochi (30 medals) and USSR's result in Calgary (29 medals). However, in the gold medal count the team finished only ninth with five gold medals.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating at the Games per sport/discipline.\nAlpine skiing.\nRussia qualified three male and one female alpine skiers, then claimed three additional female quotas during reallocation.\nRussian Alpine Skiing Federation announced the 3 men and 4 women participating on 19 January 2022.\nBiathlon.\nBased on their Nations Cup rankings in the 2020–21 Biathlon World Cup and 2021–22 Biathlon World Cup, Russian Olympic Committee has qualified a team of 5 men and 5 women.\nRussian Biathlon Union announced the 5 men and 5 women participating on 17 January 2022.

With a loss to two-time defending champion Harvard in the next game, however, the Greens lost much hope of claiming the intercollegiate championship. That setback didn't deter them, however, as they won their next five intercollegiate matches, including Yale.\nA huge shock for the season was when Yale defeated Harvard in their best-of-three series and caused the three Intercollegiate Hockey League teams to tie for the conference title. The tie left the door open for Dartmouth but the loss to Harvard prevented the Greens from being able to claim a superior record. So long as Harvard could trump Dartmouth the Hanoverians could not claim the championship despite a 6–1 intercollegiate record, the best in the nation.\nNote: Dartmouth College did not possess a moniker for its athletic teams until the 1920s, however, the university had adopted 'Dartmouth Green' as its school color in 1866.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Owls represent the Temple University in the NCAA's American Athletic Conference.\nTemple began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1894. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Temple's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "1996–97 North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1996–97 North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey team represented the University of North Dakota in college ice hockey during the 1996–97 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. In its 3rd year under head coach Dean Blais the team compiled a 31–10–2 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the thirteenth time. The Fighting Sioux defeated Boston University 6–4 to win the championship game at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nSeason.\nNorth Dakota entered the year with very few expectations. The team had only one winning season in the previous five years, had only two NHL draft picks on the roster and was seven years removed from their last NCAA tournament appearance. They had been improving under 3rd-year coach Dean Blais, but the team had yet to regain the prominence that the Fighting Sioux once possessed.\nFast start.\nWhile they were picked to finish 5th in the WCHA by the preseason coaches poll, the Sioux open with a six-game winning streak, albeit against fairly weak competition. Their progress was stymied when they headed to Minneapolis and lost both games to the Golden Gophers. UND split the following two weekends before finally recovering with a pair of wins over Minnesota–Duluth.\nMid-season stumble.\nThe Fighting Sioux won most of their games around the winter break, but when they returned to their conference schedule they couldn't find any consistency. North Dakota split three consecutive weekends in January and headed into the final weekend of the month hoping they could recover their defensive game. League-leading Minnesota was hardly the ideal opponent for North Dakota but two wins over the Gophers tied the season series and set up the possibility that UND could win the WCHA title.\nNorth Dakota went 5–1 over the next three weeks, extending their lead over Minnesota to 4 points. All the Fighting Sioux had to do in the final weekend was earn a single point against Denver and they would guarantee the regular season title for themselves. The Pioneers, however, had other ideas. North Dakota lost both games while Minnesota won both of theirs, leaving the two teams tied with identical conference records. While North Dakota had to share the conference title with the Gophers, they won the tie-breaker between the two and were awarded with the top seed in the WCHA tournament.\nConference tournament.\nNorth Dakota opened with two relatively easy home wins over Michigan Tech and advanced to the semifinal at the St. Paul Civic Center. After another comfortable win over Colorado College, North Dakota met Minnesota in the championship and the two teams fought a pitched battle for conference supremacy. The two teams fought back-and-forth all night, ending regulation knotted at 3–3. It's didn't take long to end the game once overtime began when 4th-liner Peter Armbrust fired a rebound into the net at 2:17 to win the championship.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe conference title gave North Dakota the second western seed, allowing them to bypass the first round and begin the tournament in the quarterfinal round. They promptly took out ECAC champion Cornell and advanced to the Frozen Four. In the national semifinal North Dakota swiftly built a 3–0 lead on Colorado College. The Tigers responded with two goals to get back into the game but a pair of Fighting Sioux markers 43 seconds apart ended CC's hopes and UND was heading to the championship game.\nIn the final it was Boston University who got the jump early, scoring twice in the first. North Dakota was able to turn the game into a track meet in the second and tie the game by the mid-way point. In the 12th minute, Peter Donatelli drew a controversial penalty, giving BU a power play, but it was UND's Matt Henderson who was able to score on the disadvantage. The Terriers tied the game on a separate power play shortly thereafter. UND regained the lead with their own extra-man goal two minutes later and added a fifth goal just before the period ended.\nWith a two-goal lead, North Dakota played a much more defensive-minded game in the third period. They were able to hold the Terriers off of the scoresheet until the final minute but a goal by Jon Coleman cut the lead to one with less than a minute to play. BU attempted to get control of the puck inside the Sioux end for a chance to tie the game but UND was able to clear the zone and Adam Calder sent the puck into an empty net for the final goal of North Dakota's championship season.\nAwards and honors.\nMatt Henderson's five points in the Frozen Four earned him the Tournament MOP as well as a place on the All-Tournament team with teammates David Hoogsteen, Curtis Murphy and Aaron Schweitzer. Hoogsteen and Murphy were also named to the AHCA All-American West Second Team. Both players were joined by Jason Blake on the All-WCHA First Team while Dean Blais was awarded both the WCHA Coach of the Year and the Spencer Penrose Award as the national coach of the year.\nThe surprise win by North Dakota in 1997 began a nearly unbroken stretch of 20 years where the program reached the NCAA tournament. In that time they appeared in 10 Frozen Fours and won an additional two National championships.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=11 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=11 style=\";\" | "

Due to ongoing restrictions around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of matches were cancelled, and some series moved so that the Northern Hemisphere nations hosted the matches, and some teams played for the first time since their final matches of the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe window was highlighted by the 2021 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa, which included a three-test series between the Lions and South Africa. Ahead of the tour, the Lions hosted their first home match since 2005, against Japan in Scotland, while South Africa were scheduled to host a two-test series against Georgia; the first time the teams had met outside the Rugby World Cup. The second test of this series was cancelled. Japan went on to play Ireland. Ireland also played the United States, having had to adapt their summer tour after their test series away to Fiji was cancelled. To replace Ireland's tour, Fiji traveled to New Zealand for a first ever test series against the All Blacks, who also hosted Tonga. Tonga began their preparation for their 2023 Rugby World Cup qualification series against Samoa, and Samoa used a two-match series against the Māori All Blacks as their preparation. The three-test series between Australia and France was condensed to take place within 11 days, due to French club commitments and a hotel quarantine period for the France team. Australia go on to play New Zealand in the first Bledisloe Cup match of the year.\nEngland and Wales's summer tours were reversed, as England welcomed Canada and the United States, and Wales hosted Argentina. Wales, who were originally meant to play Uruguay as part of their South America tour, instead played Canada ahead of their two-test series against Argentina. Argentina also prepared for the series with a first visit to Bucharest since 1992 to play Romania, which replaced Argentina's cancelled home game against Georgia. Romania were scheduled to face Scotland for the first time since 2011 and Scotland were also due to play Georgia as part of their Eastern Europe tour, but both matches were cancelled.\nThe window also contained a number of other 2023 Rugby World Cup qualification warm-ups as Uruguay played an Argentina XV, the Cook Islands played a Tasman Mako HP XV and the New Zealand U20 team, and Zimbabwe played Zambia. Zimbabwe were also scheduled to play Portugal, but the match was cancelled. \nFixtures.\nJune.\nNotes:\nNotes:\n2/3/4 July.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\n7 July.\nNotes:\n9/10 July.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\n13 July.\nNotes:\n17 July.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\n24 July.\nNotes:\n31 July.\nNotes:\n7 August.\nNotes:\nNotes:"

        "text": "The 1993–94 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a member of the Big Ten Conference during the 1993–94 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Head coach Stu Jackson completed his second and final season coaching the Badgers. The team played its home games in Madison, Wisconsin at the Wisconsin Field House. Wisconsin finished the season 18-11, 8-10 in Big Ten play to finish in seventh place. The Badgers earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 9 seed in the West Region, defeating No. 8 seed Cincinnati before losing to No. 1 seed Missouri in the Round of 32.\nSeason summary.\nA breakthrough season for Wisconsin culminated in its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1947. Highly-touted freshman center Rashard Griffith joined fellow Chicago natives Tracy Webster and preseason All-American Michael Finley to form arguably the most talented trio of teammates in program history.\nThough Jackson's reputation was as an uptempo coach, Wisconsin adjusted its style with Griffith on the court. The Badgers posted an 8-1 record when they scored at least 85 points, but generally played at a slower pace than the previous season. The differences from 1992-93 were most notable during conference play. Wisconsin averaged four fewer points-per-game (69.8), back near the bottom of the league. But it countered with a stingy defense that allowed 70.8 points-per-game to Big Ten foes, ranking just behind league-leader Michigan State. This was an eight-point improvement from the previous season's defense (78.9). The team led the conference in field goal defense (.428) and blocks, with 79. Webster paced the league with 40 steals and Griffith led in blocks-per-game (2.57), swatting 36 in only 14 Big Ten games.\nOffensively, a prolific three-point shooting offense led by Finley, Webster and Andy Kilbride shot and made more from long distance than any other Big Ten school, though it only converted on 34.9 percent as a team.\nGriffith debuted in spectacular fashion in the season opener versus UW-Milwaukee, posting 27 points, 12 rebounds and six assists in 32 minutes of a 106-84 win. The team scored 100 points the next game as well, a win at Loyola Marymount. The Badgers went undefeated through the non-conference schedule, which included a road win over reigning SWC champion Texas Tech and a home win over ranked rival Marquette. In early January, 11-0 Wisconsin ascended to No. 12 in the country, its highest ranking ever in the AP Poll, following a home victory over Ohio State.\nA visit to No. 18 Minnesota the next game resulted in the team's first loss, 90-53. Wisconsin bounced back to beat Glenn Robinson and No. 9 Purdue, 75-69, in a tense matchup of Top 15 teams. Then the Badgers began to succumb to the rigors of the Big Ten.\nTwo weeks later, Griffith injured his knee and missed two games, starting with a February 2 rematch with Michigan State. Led by Finley's 32 points, 11 rebounds and five assists, the Badgers blew out the Spartans, 87-62, to move to 14-3 (5-3) on the season. However, Griffith would miss two more games with back spasms while the team slipped to 6-6 in conference. Minnesota remained a thorn in its side, blowing out Wisconsin for a second time. The Gophers outscored the Badgers 199-132 in two games.\nRiding a four-game losing streak into a matchup with the Fab Five and No. 3 Michigan at the Field House, Wisconsin responded with a resounding 71-58 victory on March 2, 1994. The monumental win essentially saved the team's NCAA Tournament aspirations. The unranked Badgers dropped two of their final regular season games on the road to finish with a losing conference record, yet still received a bid to the Big Dance.\nPostseason.\nWisconsin earned a No. 9 seed in the NCAA Tournament's West Region and faced No. 8 seed Cincinnati in a first round game in Ogden, Utah. Finley and Griffith pitched in 22 points apiece and the Badgers got nine points in 16 minutes from freshman Jalil Roberts to outlast the Bearcats, 80-72. \"We were fighting uphill all the way,\" Cincinnati head coach Bob Huggins said following the game.\nIn the second round, the team lost a fast-paced duel to Missouri, the West Region's No. 1 seed, 109-96. Finley scored a career-high 36 points, but the usually dependable Wisconsin defense was torched by the Tigers' 68 percent shooting. Webster added a season-best 27 points to seven assists and no turnovers in his final game as a Badger.\nAwards and honors.\nAll-American\nAll-Big Ten\nBig Ten Player of the Week\nRoster.\n \"\"\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"|NCAA tournament\nRecords and trivia.\nTracy Webster set a Wisconsin single season record for steals, with 69. The senior's assist-to-turnover ratio of 2.38 during the 1993-94 season topped Mike Heineman's nine-year-old record and stood for five more seasons until Mike Kelley's 1998-99 season.\nWebster left school as the program's all-time leader in career assists (501) and steals (183), compiling those numbers in just three seasons. His assist total remains a Wisconsin record."

The program began intercollegiate play in 1889 and has been coached by Will Bolt since 2020.\nNebraska's baseball program was disjointed in its first decades, frequently disbanding for years at a time. The hiring of Tony Sharpe in 1947 brought stability to the program, but success was limited. Sharpe and his successor John Sanders combined to lead NU for fifty-one seasons, making just three NCAA tournament appearances between them. Nebraska hired Dave Van Horn in 1998 and he quickly turned the Huskers into a national power, making the program's first two College World Series appearances in 2001 and 2002. Mike Anderson took over for Van Horn and in 2005 led NU to its most successful season ever, including another College World Series trip. Anderson could not sustain this, however; since his departure in 2011 Nebraska has experienced modest success under head coaches Darin Erstad and Will Bolt.\nNebraska has been to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship seventeen times and advanced to three College World Series. The Cornhuskers have won eight regular season conference championships and four conference tournament championships. Sixteen Huskers have been named First-Team All-Americans and Alex Gordon won the 2005 Golden Spikes Award as the best amateur baseball player in the country."

        "title": "1997 Women's Cricket World Cup final",
        "text": "The 1997 Women's Cricket World Cup Final was a one-day cricket match between Australia and New Zealand played on 29 December 1997 at Eden Gardens in Calcutta, India. It marked the culmination of the 1997 Women's Cricket World Cup, the sixth edition of the tournament. Australia won the final by five wickets, clinching their fourth World Cup title. It was Australia's third appearance in a World Cup final, while New Zealand were making their second successive appearance.\nBoth teams finished top of their respective groups in the first stage of the competition, and won their quarter-finals by a wide margin. In the semi-finals, Australia beat the hosts, India by 19 runs in a rain-reduced match, while New Zealand defeated England by 20 runs. The New Zealand captain, Maia Lewis won the toss and opted to bat first. Her side were bowled out for 164 runs. Only three New Zealand players reached double figures, including Debbie Hockley, whose score of 79 earned her the player of the match accolade. In their response, Australia started well, and a second-wicket partnership of 71 runs between Belinda Clark and Michelle Goszko meant that despite some late pressure from the New Zealand bowlers, Australia reached the winning total with 14 deliveries remaining.\nBackground.\nThe 1997 Women's Cricket World Cup was the sixth Women's Cricket World Cup. The first had been held in 1973, pre-dating the first men's Cricket World Cup by two years. The 1997 tournament featured eleven teams, the most in the tournament's history; Australia, Denmark, England, India, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies. The tournament had originally been scheduled to feature twelve teams: Japan and Canada were each invited but unable to take part, and a late attempt to involve Bangladesh also failed. The tournament took place between 9 and 29 December 1997, featuring 33 matches over 21 days. Australia and England had won all of the previous tournaments; Australia had three titles, and England, the reigning champions, had two.\nRoute to the final.\nAustralia.\nAustralia competed in Group A of the competition, along with Denmark, England, Ireland, Pakistan and South Africa. Their first match, against Ireland, was abandoned due to rain which washed out three of the first five contests, meaning that Australia and Ireland shared the points. Facing South Africa two days later, Australia restricted their opponents to 163 runs, and then chased down the total without loss; their openers, Belinda Clark and Joanne Broadbent scored 93 and 61 respectively. In their third match, Australia faced Pakistan, who had only formed their team the previous year. Australia bowled Pakistan out for 27, the fifth lowest total in Women's One Day Internationals, and won the match by nine wickets. Against Denmark in their next match, Clark scored 229 not out, the first double century scored in women's or men's One Day International cricket. Australia finished on 412 for three, which is the highest total in a Women's World Cup match, and after bowling Denmark out for 49 runs, they also secured the largest margin of victory in Women's World Cup history, winning by 363 runs. In their final group stage match, Australia bowled England out for 95, and completed an eight-wicket win with more than 23 overs remaining. They finished top of Group A with 27 points, and qualified for the quarter-finals.\nAustralia faced the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. After winning the toss, Australia chose to bat first, and scored 223 for four; Bronwyn Calver scored 74, and Mel Jones 43. In response, the Netherlands were restricted to 108 for six, meaning that Australia progressed to the semi-finals after securing a 115-run victory. In the semi-finals, Australia met India, who had finished second in Group B. The hosts won the toss and invited Australia to bat first in a match which was reduced to 32 overs per side due to rain. Australia scored 123 for seven led by scores of 33 and 31 from Broadbent and Clark. Due to a slow over rate, India were penalised two overs, and so only had 30 overs in which to bat. They closed their innings on 104 for nine; Cathryn Fitzpatrick took three wickets for Australia as they won by 19 runs.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand were placed in Group B, which due to the uneven number of teams, only featured four other sides; India, Netherlands, Sri Lanka and the West Indies. When the New Zealand team had left home, they were expecting to play Bangladesh in the opening round of matches, but in their absence, New Zealand did not begin their campaign until the third day of the tournament. In a rain-reduced match of 20 overs per side, the Netherlands scored 48 for eight, which New Zealand chased down in 8.1 overs to win by eight wickets. They enjoyed similarly facile victories in each of their next two matches. Against Sri Lanka, unbeaten scores of 100 and 57 for Debbie Hockley and Katrina Withers helped New Zealand score 236 for three. They then bowled Sri Lanka out for 71 runs, and won by 165 runs. Two days later against the West Indies, they won by an even larger margin; another century from Hockley helped to set up a 198-run victory. New Zealand faced India in their final group match, and scored 176 for nine after batting first. In their chase, India began well, and looked likely to win the match, but collapsed from 150 for four, and the teams tied the match. New Zealand finished as group winners, three points ahead of India.\nDrawn against Ireland in the quarter-finals, New Zealand chose to bat first, and scored 244 for three; Hockley and Emily Drumm each made half-centuries. They then restricted Ireland to 105 for nine during their chase, to secure a 139-run victory. In the semi-finals, they faced England, who had finished as runners-up in Group A. The four semi-finalists were the same teams which had finished as the top four teams at the 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup. New Zealand once again batted first after winning the toss, and scored 175 for six; Hockley and Withers were their top-scorers with 43 and 35 respectively. As in the other semi-final, the second innings was shortened, as England were penalised one over for a slow over-rate, though the England team protested that the umpires had not allowed extra time for a number of stoppages during the New Zealand innings. As it was, England were bowled out for 155; New Zealand won by 20 overs and secured their second successive final.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe final was held at the Eden Gardens, in Calcutta, India, on 29 December 1997. The crowd was reported to be in excess of 50,000, partly due to the local government providing transportation for local women to attend the match, though estimates varied. A state government official suggested the crowd to be around 80,000, while the Australian team manager Chris Matthews provided a more modest estimate of \"more than 25,000\". In 2017, reflecting on the match, Clark said: \"To this day, I don't know how many people were there at Eden Gardens that day. I've heard different variations. One thing I can tell you, though, is my eardrums were buzzing; I hadn't played in front of such a crowd ever before.\" The attendance was unusually high for a women's cricket match; Melinda Farrell, an Australian cricket journalist, described it as \"an outlier in women's cricket for 23 years\". Some of the players found the atmosphere distracting, as it was something they were unused to; Hockley said that it was difficult to hear the others players, and \"until you're there you don't realise that's actually what happens. It probably happens at men's games all the time.\"\nAloke Bhattacharjee and S. Choudhary were appointed as the umpires for the match. Clark described the pitch as atypical for an Indian ground, as it had a lot of grass left on the wicket. The New Zealand captain, Lewis, won the toss and chose to bat first. Writing in \"The Times\", Thrasy Petropoulos suggested that much of New Zealand's hopes of winning rested on their opening batters, Hockley and Drumm, and how they would cope with Australia's fast bowler, Fitzpatrick. Instead, it was the medium-pace of Calver who took the first two wickets, bowling Drumm for six runs, and having Shelley Fruin caught by Clark for eight runs. Katrina Withers, New Zealand's next batter, was dismissed by what Petropoulos described as \"the ball of the day\", when she edged an outswinging delivery from Charmaine Mason to the wicket-keeper, Julia Price. Withers had scored five, and New Zealand were 49 for three. Lewis was trapped leg before wicket (lbw) by the right-arm leg spin of Olivia Magno for 10 runs, and shortly after Kathryn Ramel was the first of two New Zealand batters to be run out, having only scored one run. Despite the regular loss of wickets, New Zealand maintained a steady run rate, and Hockley anchored their innings. Karen Rolton, who finished with Australia's best bowling analysis, took the next two wickets; she had Clare Nicholson adjudged lbw for two runs, and then Sarah McLauchlan was stumped for eight, moving New Zealand onto 125 for seven. The New Zealand wicket-keeper, Rebecca Rolls, was one of few batters to provide support for Hockley, scoring 18 runs out of a partnership of 30 with the opener. Hockley was dismissed in the 47th over, bowled by Fitzpatrick for 79 runs, including 7 fours and 1 six. Rolls was dismissed soon after, caught by Calver off the bowling of Mason. New Zealand's final two batters, Catherine Campbell and Kelly Brown added seven more runs before Brown was run out, ending their team's innings on 164 all out.\nAustralia opened the batting in their chase with Broadbent and Clark; the pair put on 36 runs together before Broadbent was caught by Lewis off the bowling of Ramel for 15 runs. Michelle Goszko joined Clark, and the two New South Wales teammates pushed Australia ahead of the required rate of 3.3 runs per over. Goszko was bowled by Withers for 37 runs, and had shared a partnership of 71 runs with Clark, taking Australia to 107 for two. Clark said that the partnership \"got enough runs for the rest of the team to build on\". Clark was the next batter to be dismissed, when she was caught and bowled by Campbell shortly after reaching her half-century. Australia were 135 for three, and needed 30 runs from the final 12 overs to win. Although Clark felt that Australia were in control of the match, economical bowling from New Zealand put pressure on the Australian batters. Rolton and Jones added another 36 runs before Jones was bowled by Keenan for 17; Rolton was dismissed soon after, caught by Brown off the bowling of Ramel for 24. Calver scored the winning runs for Australia with 14 deliveries remaining.\nScorecard.\nUmpires:\nKey\nAftermath.\nHockley was named as player of the match, which was titled \"Eve of the Match\". She later said that she only won because \"in India they tended to just give it to the batsman who score the most runs. It just wouldn't happen now because you're more likely to give it to someone on the winning team\". Hockley also finished as the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 456 runs, while Withers took the most wickets, 13. Clark was named as the player of the tournament. Australia and New Zealand met again in the 2000 Women's Cricket World Cup Final, which New Zealand won by four runs."

In the Grand Prix Special, in which only two riders of the Grand Prix class were not allowed to take part, the difference of quality became even more pronounced. Theurer, Kyrklund and the three Soviet riders were the only ones who managed to score more than 1000 points. Theurer's gold medal however was never in danger and with a classy performance she received 1370 points, almost double as much as the last placed rider from Romania in this individual competition. \nTheurer received criticism for deciding to go to Moscow instead of Goodwood, which hosted the Olympic Festival for west-block nations. Without much support from the Austrian Federation, her horse Mon Cherie was flown to Moscow by Niki Lauda."

        "text": "The individual show jumping at the 1980 Summer Olympics took place on 3 August at the Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium. The event was open to men and women. This event was heavily impacted by the American-led boycott. There were 16 competitors from 7 nations. Previous Games had approximately 50 riders at each. The event was won by Jan Kowalczyk of Poland, the nation's first victory in individual jumping and first medal in the event since 1924. Nikolai Korolkov earned the Soviet Union's first medal in the event with his silver. Mexico reached the podium for the first time since 1948 with Joaquín Pérez's bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900. The team and individual events remained separated, as they had been starting in 1968.\nThe small field was devoid of top riders. Even among Western nations that competed at the Games, such as Belgium, France, Italy, and Great Britain, participation in this event was low, with many opting to compete at the Rotterdam Show Jumping Festival instead. None of the top 10 riders from the 1976 competition returned. No former Olympic medalists were present. No World Championships medalists competed.\nBulgaria made its debut in the event. Mexico competed for the 8th time, most of any nation competing but well behind the 14 appearances of France (missing the event for only the second time); eleven nations with more appearances than Mexico did not compete in 1980.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used the two-round format introduced in 1952. The elimination feature added in 1968 was not used due to the small field; in previous years, the top 20 riders advanced from the first round to the second but with only 16 starters in 1980 there was no elimination. Both rounds were combined to determine placement. If tied a jump-off between all tied riders would determine the winners."

        "title": "Duke–North Carolina lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Duke–North Carolina lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between the Duke Blue Devils and the North Carolina Tar Heels. Located just 9.8 miles apart on Tobacco Road, the two programs are classic rivals in the Atlantic Coast Conference, headlined by their basketball and football rivalries, but also extending to lacrosse - even club lacrosse. The rivalry has carried national importance itself since the 1990s, leading to numerous thrilling contests between the two in the ACC and NCAA postseason tournaments. Duke leads the ACC series 9–4 and has compiled a perfect 4–0 mark against the heels in NCAA tournament play. Current Heels coach Joe Breschi summed up the rivalry as \"when you’re 12 miles away from a school that you don’t like and doesn’t like you, it makes it more intense. There’s so much more meaning there than any other game. That’s what makes winning that much more sweet.\" In 2019, his counterpart Duke head coach John Danowski described the annual challenge of facing UNC: \"They're really good. They're very well-coached, they get the best players in the country year after year, they have the top recruiting classes, and they hate Duke.\" As a testament to the national success between the two schools, the Blue Devils have won three national titles (2010, 2013, 2014), while the Tar Heels lay claim to five (1981, 1982, 1986, 1991, 2016). As of the end of the 2023 season, North Carolina leads the series 43–37.\nSeries history.\nCarolina dominance (1950s to 1995).\nThe series first began in Durham in 1952, with Duke emerging victorious as a four-goal winner. The Atlantic Coast Conference began sponsoring men's lacrosse two years later and Duke would again prevail in a 15–1 rout. That season, the Blue Devils would capture the inaugural ACC crown. However, despite the series becoming a conference matchup, the teams would not meet again until 1964, as North Carolina shutout Duke 14–0. After another hiatus in 1966, Duke would take the following season's game and since that date the rivalry has been played annually. Traditionally, the programs have been the southernmost programs playing collegiate lacrosse. As a result, they were at a recruiting disadvantage for much of the 20th century due to the long distances from recruiting hotbeds and other schools. NC State had a program for ten years in the 1970s and 1980s, but the ACC schools were the only Division I members in North Carolina for decades. This contributed to the importance of the annual series in the eyes of supporters and sparse southern recruiting.\nWith this context, the present national powers struggled for much of their early existence against established programs like Maryland and Virginia. The Tar Heels would build momentum in the 1970s, appearing in their first NCAA tournament in 1976, their first Final Four in 1980, and claiming their first national title in 1981. Duke struggled during this same period, at one point going winless in conference play for 10 straight years, compiling an 0–35 mark. The Blue Devils did not fare much better against a newly dominant Tar Heels program. North Carolina won a series-record 19 consecutive victories, spanning the late 1960s, entire decade of the 1970s, and the mid-1980s. The last Carolina triumph in this streak was an overtime victory in 1986 before Duke ended the drought with a one-goal win the next year. However, after this rare loss, Carolina would take the next 11 meetings, with only two games decided by three or fewer goals. Mike Pressler would change the course of the rivalry and launch Duke's current status as a national power. After losing his first seven matchups, Pressler's Blue Devils downed UNC in a 14–6 display in the 1995 ACC tournament. Duke would earn the league tournament title and proceed to its third-ever NCAA postseason appearance. However, Duke had yet to advance past the quarterfinals on the national stage.\nRecent history (1995 to present).\nThat 1995 meeting would mark the turning point in the rivalry, as the Blue Devils won eight of the next ten games. On the national stage, Duke would reach the Final Four in 1997 before the rivals met for their first NCAA postseason meeting the next year. #7 Duke downed the Heels 16–14 before falling in the quarters to eventual national champion Princeton. After the '98 season, Carolina would experience a downturn as the Blue Devils took the reign as the predominant team in the South. Coupled with a coaching change, UNC made just two tournament appearances between 1999 and 2006 shortly after their streak of 17 consecutive appearances had ended in 1996.\nCarolina would take three straight meetings from 2002 to 2004, but Duke would engineer in a season sweep in its 2005 national runner-up season. That sweep would portend further dominance from the Blue Devils, as they defeated UNC 11 straight times. This period often included rematches in the ACC tournament and twice during the NCAA postseason. In 2007, Duke advanced to the Final Four by defeating the Heels for the third time that season, pulling away from Carolina by a score of 19 to 11. Two seasons later, Duke again defeated UNC in the quarters in a closer affair. Prior to that postseason game, senior defenseman Ryan McFadyen described the stakes of the rivalry: There's nothing like it. No other rivalry, even Maryland or UVA, is the same. It's going to be a hard-fought game and guys are going battle back and forth with each other the whole time. There's even going to be some dirty play. There's bad blood between these two teams, for sure.\" The two had met in the ACC championship and would be a close game. In the fourth quarter, the Heels rallied from a four-goal deficit to cut Duke's lead to one, but a Sean Delaney shot missed high as time expired to seal another Blue Devils victory. After UNC took the 2010 regular season matchup, Duke routed UNC, spurred by a six-goal run in the second half, en route to its first-ever national championship in lacrosse. This victory was Duke's third in the quarterfinals over the Heels in just four seasons, improving their overall NCAA postseason Tobacco Road record to a perfect 4–0.\nThe last decade has seen an increasingly competitive series between the two schools. Of the previous eight meetings, four went to Duke and four went to North Carolina. Furthermore, the teams combined for four national titles (2010, 2013, 2014, 2016) and eight Final Four appearances during the period. From 2007 to 2015, 12 of the 16 games played between the two schools occurred when both were ranked inside the USILA Top 10. Two recent games, both UNC victories, were particularly notable affairs. In the 2013 ACC tournament, the Heels prevailed 18–17, combining for 35 goals, the second-most in the series, only trailing a 39-goal game in 1990. After the Blue Devils nearly completed a nine-goal comeback, the game also made ACC tournament history, with the most total goals scored, while Duke's Jordan Wolf and his seven points were one shy of tying the individual point record in the tournament. Another shootout occurred in 2016, with UNC beating Duke by a score of 17–16 in sudden death overtime to preserve their postseason hopes. Senior midfielder Patrick Kelly secured the victory with just over two minutes remaining in overtime after Duke had scored a tying goal in regulation with only eight seconds to go. That victory propelled the Heels to the NCAA tournament and their run to the national title.\nAfter a one-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic cancellations, the teams met as No. 1 and No. 2 in 2021 with undefeated records at the line (9–0 for Duke; 8–0 for UNC). Top-ranked Duke scored the game-winner by way of attackman Joe Robertson after the game headed to overtime knotted at 11.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs.\nGame results.\nRankings are incomplete (Duke accurate from 1993 to present; North Carolina accurate from 1999 to present)."

        "text": "The individual show jumping at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place between 26 September and 2 October at the Seoul Olympic Stadium. It featured a significant change to the competition format from prior years. The event was open to men and women. There were 74 competitors from 24 nations. Each nation could have up to 4 riders, up from 3 in previous years (though only a maximum of 3 could advance to the final). The event was won by Pierre Durand Jr. of France, the nation's first victory in individual jumping since 1964 and fourth overall—most of any nation, moving out of a tie with Italy at three. Silver went to Greg Best of the United States, with bronze to Karsten Huck of West Germany.\nBackground.\nThis was the 18th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900. The team and individual events remained separated, as they had been starting in 1968.\nFive of the top 10 riders from the 1984 Games returned: gold medalist Joseph Fargis of the United States, fourth-place finisher Mario Deslauriers of Canada, sixth-place finisher Luis Álvarez de Cervera of Spain, seventh-place finisher Frédéric Cottier of France, and tenth-place finisher Luis Astolfi of Spain. The field was considered open, with top riders (including 1986 World Champion Gail Greenough of Canada and 1987 World Cup winner Katharine Burdsall of the United States) not competing.\nColombia and Liechtenstein each made their debut in the event. France competed for the 16th time, most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition underwent a significant format change, adding a two-round qualifying round before the two-round final. The course was 770 metres long, with jumps up to 1.60 metres high, a 2.00 metre oxer, and a 4.60 metre water jump.\nIn the qualifying round, each pair performed in two rounds. There was no elimination between the two rounds of the qualifying. Positive scoring, rather than the fault system, was used for the qualifying round. The total score for the two rounds in qualifying was used to determined advancement to the final. A maximum of 50% of the pairs could advance (37 of the 74 starters), with each nation limited to three riders advancing.\nThe final also consisted of two rounds. This time, however, there was a cut between the two rounds; only the top 20 advanced from the first round of the final to the second. Both rounds of the final used the typical fault system of scoring. The combined score for both rounds determined the placement. A jump-off would be used if necessary to break ties for medal positions; other ties would not be broken.\nResults.\nBourdy (France), Brinkmann (West Germany), and Pyrah (Great Britain) did not advance due to the limit of three pairs per nation. Bourdy was tied for 8th in the qualifying round; Cottier and Durand had lower scores than him but advanced instead. Durand, 18th overall and 4th among French riders in qualifying, ran both rounds of the final without any jumping penalties and finished with a total of 1.25 faults from time to win the gold medal. Huck had led the first round of the final, with a completely clean run (0 faults) to Durand's 0.25 time faults, and went last in the second round of the final knowing that Durand had reached the 1.25 total. Huck nearly made the second round clean as well, but hit the next-to-last rail to receive 4 faults—tied with Best for second, who had had 4 in the first round but was clean in the second. In the jump-off, both Huck and Best had 4 faults again; the silver medal went to the American based on time in the jump-off."

Their first test came against Princeton and while the team was able to withstand the assault from the Tigers, Dartmouth was unable to score in the game and lost 0–2.

The tournament will be held in Uzbekistan. It will be the first FIFA tournament ever hosted by Uzbekistan, the first FIFA tournament to be ever hosted in Central Asia. The tournament will return to its usual four-year cycle after the previous tournament was delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPortugal is the defending champion, defeating Argentina in the final, 2–1.\nAfghanistan, France, New Zealand and Tajikistan will make their FIFA Futsal World Cup debuts.\nHost selection.\nIn April 2023, Morocco was reported to have been given the hosting rights as they were reported to be the only bid submitted to FIFA. However, Uzbekistan was selected as host on 23 June 2023. \nUzbekistan's enthusiasm and impressive track-record at hosting events were deemed as the reasons for Uzbekistan's selection. This is fourth time Asia will host the event and marks the first time a FIFA tournament has been held in Central Asia. Prior, Uzbekistan was supposed to host the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, but were stripped of the hosting rights due to a number of logistical and technical issues.\nQualification.\nA total of 24 teams qualify for the final tournament, in addition to Uzbekistan who qualified automatically as host, 23 other teams qualify from six separate continental competitions. Overall, 121 nations entered qualification.\nOf the 24 qualifiers, four will make their debut: Afghanistan, France, New Zealand and Tajikistan. \nAfghanistan's and Tajikistan's qualification, along with Iran and hosts Uzbekistan, means that for the first time, four nations from Central Asia qualified for the World Cup. This will also be Tajikistan's first senior FIFA tournament, having previously participated at two FIFA U-17 World Cups. This will be Afghanistan's first ever FIFA tournament.\nOf the returnees, Europeans Croatia and Netherlands both return after a 24-year absence. Libya returns after last qualifying in 2012 while Cuba and Ukraine qualified after missing out on the last edition.\nNotable absentees include Russia, who were banned from qualification by UEFA due to the country's invasion of Ukraine. The 2022 AFC Futsal Asian Cup champions, Japan, failed to qualify after getting eliminated in the group stage of the Futsal Asian Cup for the first time in their history. From Africa, Egypt failed to qualify for the first time since 1992 after losing the third place play off against Libya at the 2024 Futsal Africa Cup of Nations. After making the 2016 and 2021 editions, Vietnam failed to qualify.\nCzech Republic, Serbia, and United States all failed to qualify after making the 2021 edition.\nVenues.\nFIFA went to investigate the arenas in the Uzbek cities of Tashkent, Bukhara, Andijan and Fergana. After they received the hosting rights, Uzbekistan proposed four venues for the tournament, all based in the capital, Tashkent. Tashkent, Bukhara and Andijan were confirmed as the three host cities on 19 April 2024.\nDraw.\nThe draw will be held on 26 May 2024 at the Registan Square in Samarkand.\nThe 24 teams will be drawn into six groups of four teams, with the host Uzbekistan automatically seeded to Pot 1 and placed into the first position of Group A.\nThe draw will start with the host to A1, the teams from Pot 1 will be drawn first, the teams from Pots 2, 3 and 4 need to skip groups to avoid geographical clash and there will be no 2 teams to play from the same confederation, then the draw will conclude with teams from Pot 4.\nGroup stage.\nAll times are local, UZT ().\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nThe four best third-placed teams from the six groups advance to the knockout stage along with the six group winners and six runners-up.\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match is level at the end of normal playing time, extra time shall be played (two periods of five minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. However, for the third place match, if it is played directly before the final, no extra time shall be played and the winner shall be determined by a penalty shoot-out.\nBracket.\nThe specific match-ups involving the third-placed teams depend on which four third-placed teams qualified for the round of 16:"

        "text": "The 1914–15 Dartmouth men's ice hockey season was the 10th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter two very successful seasons it appeared that Dartmouth was going to have a down year when it dropped its first two games of the season. The loss to defending Canadian champion Ottawa wasn't unexpected and it gave the team a good foundation when they began their season with a 4-2 win over MAC. After defeating defending champion Princeton 4–1 the team entered a showdown with Harvard which was expected to determine the champion for the season.\nDespite not being part of the big three, Dartmouth had challenged the powers over the previous two seasons but the team had yet to defeat the Crimson. In their ninth meeting, the Greens finally broke through on the strength of a hat-trick from Wanamaker and dispatched Harvard. After a succeeding win over MIT, Dartmouth entered their final collegiate game of the season against Yale with a championship waiting on the other side. Unfortunately, the Elis were equal to the task and the two fought to a 1-1 draw after 40 minutes. The teams agreed to two 5-minute overtime periods and, after Yale scored in the first, Dartmouth began pressing to even the score in the second. Unfortunately the Greens were called for a penalty and the Elis scored twice with the man-advantage to put the game out of reach.\nDartmouth lost their final game almost three weeks later, but it was the loss to Yale that was dire. Losing to the Elis meant that Dartmouth could not claim the championship but, because Harvard had triumphed over Yale, none of the three teams could lay claim to the title. There was a brief attempt to schedule additional for the three at the end of the year but because Harvard had already disbanded their team, nothing came to fruition.\nNote: Dartmouth College did not possess a moniker for its athletic teams until the 1920s, however, the university had adopted 'Dartmouth Green' as its school color in 1866.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Installed as part of a project to honor Hispanic culture, the monument was removed in June 2020 amid the George Floyd protests. It was situated outside the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Center (until 2017 the Oñate Monument and Visitor Center) in Alcalde, New Mexico from 1994 to 2020.\nDescription and history.\nThe statue, cast in bronze by Reynaldo Rivera, was erected in 1994. The right foot of the statue was cut off on December 29, 1997, shortly before commemorations for the 400th anniversary, in 1998, of Oñate's arrival in New Mexico. A note was left at the scene that said \"Fair is fair.\" The foot was recast. Some commentators suggested leaving the statue maimed as a symbolic reminder of the foot-amputating Acoma Massacre. A local filmmaker, Chris Eyre, was contacted by one of the two perpetrators, who said, \"I'm back on the scene to show people that Oñate and his supporters must be shamed.\" The sculptor responded that chopping feet \"was the nature of discipline of 400 years ago\".\nIn 2017 the statue's left foot was painted red, and the words \"Remember 1680\" (year of the Pueblo revolt) were written with paint on the monument's base.\nThe county of Rio Arriba removed the statue on June 15, 2020. In 2023, The statue was moved to Española, New Mexico. During a rally on September 28, 2023 celebrating the postponement of the installation, Jacob Johns who was participating in a prayer ceremony was shot. The suspected 23-year-old shooter Ryan Martinez, who had been trying to access the pedestal, fled by car but was taken into custody. He is charged with attempted first-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and reckless driving with firearm- and hate-crime-related sentencing enhancements."

        "text": "This is a list of Olympic champions in men's water polo since the inaugural official edition in 1900.\nHistory.\nMen's water polo tournaments have been staged at the Olympic Games since 1900. Men's water polo was among the first team sports introduced at the modern Olympic Games in 1900. Seven European teams from four countries, including four from the host nation France, took part in the competition. The British team was the inaugural champion. At the 1904 Summer Olympics, a water polo tournament was contested, three club teams of seven players each entered. A German team tried to enter, but its entry was refused because the players did not play for the same club. The event took place in a pond in Forest Park, the location of both the Olympics and the World's Fair. Previously, the International Olympic Committee and International Swimming Federation (FINA) considered the water polo event at the 1904 Olympics as a demonstration sport. However, in July 2021, after accepting the recommendation of Olympic historian Bill Mallon, the IOC recognized water polo along with several others as an official sport of the 1904 Olympic program. Water polo was not played at the 1906 Olympics.\nAs of the 2020 Summer Olympics, men's water polo teams from ten European countries won all 27 official tournaments.\nFrom 1908 to 1920, the Great Britain men's national water polo team won three consecutive gold medals at the Olympics, becoming the first team to have an Olympic winning streak in water polo.\nHungary is the most successful country in the men's Olympic water polo tournament, with nine Olympic gold medals.

        "title": "Disc golf in Finland",
        "text": "Disc golf (in ) is a popular sport in Finland played at the recreational, club, and international competition levels.\nDisc golf in Finland is governed by the Finnish Disc Golf Association (FDGA, ). Its mission is to promote the sport and to \"organize disc golf activities in Finland together with its approximately 150 member organizations.\"\nPopularity.\nDisc golf is the fastest growing sport in Finland. According to the Finnish Research Institute for Olympic Sports (KIHU), it is more popular among Finns than ball golf, volleyball, basketball and tennis. The country is frequently called a model country for disc golf, a Mecca, and a hot bed.\nIn June 2020, there were 2,815 active PDGA members and 2,985 expired memberships, an increase from June 2015, when there were 1,434 and 686, respectively.\nThe popularity of disc golf in Finland has been variously attributed to Jussi Meresmaa’s marketing know-how, the fact that disc golf is taught in gym class curriculums, and that municipalities build courses to attract new taxpayers. Finland's proximity to other disc golf hubs around the Baltic Sea, namely Estonia and Sweden, is also a factor.\nCourses.\nApproximately 7% of the world's disc golf courses are located in Finland. Some of the most notable ones include Puijo DGP in Kuopio, Kaatis in Vihti, Pikkarala Frisbeegolf in Oulu. In 2019, Helsinki topped UDisc's list of Top 5 Disc Golf Cities outside the United States.\nMost courses in Finland are located in public parks or sporting areas and can be played for free. Commercial courses are generally found around sports complexes, ski resorts, spas and camping areas.\nMarket.\nFinland is the disc golf market share leader in Europe. In 2014, Spin18 estimated the total value of the European disc golf industry to 16 million Euros, with Finland accounting for more than half of it, at around 9 million Euros.\nBudget Sport, a large Finnish sports equipment retailer, sponsored the 2015 European Open and features disc golf equipment prominently in its retail stores.\nManufacturers.\nAs a country, Finland has the second largest number of disc golf equipment manufacturers, second only to the United States. Major Finnish disc brands include Discmania, founded by Jussi Meresmaa in Tampere, Finland, Westside Discs, which is associated with Dynamic Discs and Latitude 64˚, Viking, Obsidian, and Prodiscus, which also manufacturers discs for Missouri-based Full Turn and Australian Fourth Circle Discs.\nTourism.\nDisc golf courses are marketed by Finnish municipalities and on tourism board websites.\nÅland Islands.\nIn May 2020, ], Åland’s Chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses, approached DiscGolfPark with the ambitious project of turning Åland into a \"disc golf island\" by building 16 new courses by the end of the summer, one for each municipality in the autonomous region. At the time of the press release, there were only two courses on Åland. \n \n \nMass media.\nCoverage of disc golf tournaments is mainstream in Finland. It is not uncommon for major tournaments and local competitions to get coverage.\nTelevision.\nDisc golf gets frequent coverage on national television since the 2005 European Championships. In 2013, the final round of the European Open aired for 90 minutes nationwide on YLE."

An anime television series adaptation by Blade, titled \"Iwa-Kakeru! Sport Climbing Girls\", aired from October to December 2020.\nPlot.\nKonomi Kasahara is a first-year student who attends Hanamiya Girls' High School and is a master at puzzles. While looking for a club to join, she comes across the school's climbing wall. This fateful encounter changes her life when she becomes a member of the Climbing Club.\nMedia.\nManga.\n\"Iwa-Kakeru! Climbing Girls\", written and illustrated by Ryūdai Ishizaka, was serialized online via Cygames' Cycomi manga app and website from December 5, 2017, to May 18, 2019. A sequel manga, titled \"Iwa-Kakeru!! Try a new climbing\", was serialized via Cycomi from June 8, 2019, to March 20, 2021.\nAnime.\nOn April 24, 2020, an anime television series adaptation, titled \"Iwa-Kakeru! Sport Climbing Girls\", was announced. The series was animated by Blade and directed by Tetsurō Amino, with Touko Machida handling series composition, Yoshihiro Watanabe designing the characters, and Tsubasa Ito composing the series' music. It aired from October 4 to December 20, 2020, on ABC and TV Asahi's brand new Animazing!!! programming block. Aina Suzuki performed the opening theme , while Sumire Uesaka, Yui Ishikawa, Aina Suzuki, and Miyu Tomita performed the ending \"LET'S CLIMB↑\" as their respective characters. Crunchyroll streamed the series in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, and CIS. The series is licensed by Medialink in South and Southeast Asia.\nStage play.\nA stage play of the series performed by the idol group AKB48 ran at the Sunshine Theatre in Tokyo from February 17 to February 20, 2022.\nReception.\nPreviews.\nThe anime series' first episode garnered mixed reviews from Anime News Network's staff during the Fall 2020 season previews. James Beckett was critical of the lack of excitement in the subject of rock climbing, characters with \"functional\" personalities and \"terribly cheap\" animation that fails to display the girls' athleticism. Nicholas Dupree commended the premiere for being \"a decent ambassador\" that covers its subject matter and narrative points serviceably well, but criticized Jun and Konomi's character writing and the \"below average\" production quality for having unappealing climbing visuals. Theron Martin and Rebecca Silverman gave similar praise to Konomi's puzzle game approach to the sport and the muscular designs of the girls' physique, with the former pointing out the \"disappointingly limited\" animation and \"suggestive\" camera angles in the rock climbing scenes and the latter being critical of Jun's unwelcoming presence. The fifth reviewer, Caitlin Moore, was critical of the use of \"leering camera angles\" during the climbing scenes and the characters of Konomi and Jun stretching credibility in their approach to the sport, but felt immediately hooked into the subject matter it displayed, concluding that: \"\"Iwa-Kakeru! -Sport Climbing Girls-\" isn't particularly great and I doubt it'll have staying power of any kind, but it scratches a very specific itch I've had for a while.\"\nSeries.\nMoore reviewed the complete anime series in 2021 and gave it a C+ grade. While commending the vast information about rock climbing throughout the episodes and the production having \"bright candy-colors and consistently on-model animation\", she criticized the \"suspension of disbelief\" and lack of \"realistic safety measures\" during the rock climbing scenes, the annoyance of the secondary characters and the \"fan service-driven storyboarding\" that diminished the girls' athletic abilities, concluding that: \"\"Iwa-Kakeru!\" is a perfectly middling anime, with a sport I enjoyed learning about, decent production values, a main cast I have no strong feelings about whatsoever, and a secondary cast that I wouldn't mind seeing cast into a pit of acid. It was made to capture a moment, but is doomed to be forgotten before that moment comes to pass, if it ever does at all.\""

        "text": "The 2020 English cricket season was originally scheduled to run between 2 April and 25 September. It was planned to have first-class, one-day and Twenty20 cricket competitions throughout England and Wales and as well as the launch of a new franchised 100 ball competition, The Hundred; it would have been the 131st year in which the County Championship has been an official competition. \nOn 24 April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that no professional cricket would be played in England before 1 July 2020. In late May 2020, the ECB looked at the scheduling of domestic cricket for the summer, with the Royal London One-Day Cup likely to be abandoned. The ECB also confirmed that no domestic cricket would be played before 1 August 2020. In June 2020, some clubs raised concerns about the logistics of travelling and the financial viability of playing first-class cricket, with 50-over matches being a more realistic possibility. On 29 June 2020, the ECB confirmed that the county cricket season would begin on 1 August 2020, with the formats to be agreed in early July.\nOn 7 July 2020, the majority of counties voted to play first-class and Twenty20 cricket, with the Royal London One-Day Cup being cancelled. The launch of The Hundred was also postponed to 2021 due to the pandemic. A one-off first-class competition, named the Bob Willis Trophy, was created to replace the County Championship, which was suspended until 2021; the counties were split into three regional groups with a final to be held at Lord's. The eight new women's regional teams played in the inaugural Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy.\nAs a result of the pandemic, the vast majority of clubs placed players and staff on furlough. The traditional start to the season between the County Championship teams and the six Marylebone Cricket Club University teams (MCCU) of England and Wales, was cancelled. The first two rounds of fixtures would have been first-class matches, with the ECB stating that the 2020 University Matches would have been the last ones to have first-class status.\nCricket returned on 8 July 2020 when England and the West Indies began a three match test series behind closed doors at the Rose Bowl with subsequent Tests also played behind closed doors at Old Trafford."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Bruins represent the University of California, Los Angeles in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference.\nUCLA began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1919. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but UCLA's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

However, The CEO of the Canadian Olympic Committee, David Shoemaker, was \"delighted with that performance\".\nPolitical boycott.\nOn December 8, 2021, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a diplomatic boycott of the games, citing human rights concerns.

Representative Katko published an open letter recommending a boycott to the House Committee on Homeland Security, as well as President Biden, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, and the International Olympic Committee. In the open letter, Katko cited an earlier 19 January 2021 statement from then-serving U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in which Pompeo stated that, \"since at least March 2017, the People's Republic of China (PRC), under the direction and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has committed crimes against humanity against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.\"\nFormer United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Republican Nikki Haley, announced her support of a possible boycott, authoring a 25 February 2021 op-ed for Fox News titled \"Amb. Nikki Haley: Biden should boycott China's Winter Olympics next year\", comparing the government and ideology of Nazi Germany to that of \"Communist China\", urging President Biden to boycott the Olympics in collaboration with American-allied nations. Haley further compared the future 2022 Beijing Games to the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the last Olympics to be held before the outbreak of World War II.\nIn an unrelated interview on 5 March 2021, former Secretary Pompeo stated that the United States should withdraw from the 2022 Olympic Games. In an interview with conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt, Pompeo cited \"nasty activity\" by the Chinese government as evidence to support a boycott.\nIn a \"Politico\" article published on 10 March 2021, Texas Senator Ted Cruz spoke against a possible boycott, stating, \"I don't think we should be punishing athletes who have spent their entire lives training. We should go to Beijing, compete, and win.\" Florida Senator Marco Rubio previously signed a resolution authored by Senator Rick Scott which \"demanded the International Olympic Committee move the 2022 Winter Olympics out of Communist China\", but also refused to support a boycott, stating that he did not make a formal decision yet. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that \"It's important that we use every opportunity to advance global support against what China is doing\", recognizing that \"[boycotting the 2022 Olympics] may be not a realistic path forward, but it's certainly something we should be talking about.\"\nOn 15 March 2021, the \"New York Times\" published an op-ed by U.S. Senator and former 2012 Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, titled \"The Right Way to Boycott the Beijing Olympics.\" In the piece, Romney stated that the United States should pursue a partial \"economic and diplomatic boycott\" of the Olympics, with athletes participating in the games but \"limiting spectators, selectively shaping our respective delegations and refraining from broadcasting Chinese propaganda.\" Romney ended the piece criticizing the International Olympic Committee for their selection of host countries, commenting that \"In authoritarian states, the Olympics has more often been a tool of propaganda than a lever of reform.\"\nOn 19 October 2021, American figure skater Evan Bates described the situation in Xinjiang as \"terrible\" and \"awful\", and Vincent Zhou and Nathan Chen, skaters of Chinese descent, echoed Bates' statement over the human rights situation in Xinjiang.\nOn 6 December 2021, President Biden announced that the United States would diplomatically boycott the Olympic Games. Unlike a complete boycott, it did not have any impact for any athletes from the United States attending the Winter Games.\nA boycott of the 2022 Olympic Games would have been the second American-led boycott of the modern Olympic Games. The United States and 65 other nations boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics, which were primarily held in Moscow, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, in present-day Russia. The bloc cited the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan as their rationale for the boycott, with the United States hosting a substitute track and field event called the Liberty Bell Classic, with China in attendance. Four years later, the Soviet Union and 14 of its allies then boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics, which were held in Los Angeles, United States. The Soviet-allied countries then substituted the 1984 Olympics by organizing the Friendship Games (which was attended by China). The Friendship Games were held in a variety of venues, including the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic and Slovakia), Cuba, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, and East Germany (now part of Germany). Despite participating in the Friendship Games, China also participated at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, participating for the first time since 1952 and having boycotted the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow due to the Sino-Soviet split.\nAthlete safety.\nCompetitors were warned by Human Rights Watch that speaking out was not tolerated in China and as a result if they spoke out about human rights or other issues in China they faced significant legal penalties. For their protection the American team was shielded from questions related to human rights.\nMembers of Congress expressed their concerns about athlete safety. Retired Olympic cross-country skier Noah Hoffman also expressed concerns about athlete safety, citing China's human rights record and a lack of concern shown by the IOC."

The Huskies represent the University of Connecticut in the NCAA Division I Big East Conference.\nUConn began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1900. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but UConn's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

        "title": "Nippon Professional Baseball playoffs",
        "text": "The Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) playoffs have taken several different forms throughout the organization's history. Japanese baseball is divided into two leagues; the Pacific League (PL) is less popular and less profitable than the Central League (CL). As a result, the PL has employed various playoff formats throughout its history in an effort to increase fan interest. The PL's first true playoff system was introduced in the 1973 season. It involved a split season plan that divided the season into two halves and the two teams that won each half went on to play each other in a five-game playoff series, with the winner advancing to the Japan Series. While popular with fans, the format was scrapped after ten seasons because of major issues and criticisms. In the year following their last split season, the PL returned to a single season, however if five or fewer games separated the first- and second-place teams at the end of the season, the two teams would play each other in a five-game playoff series. This playoff system was unpopular and ridiculed by media and fans. It only lasted three seasons with a playoff series never needing to be played.\nWith their first two playoff systems abolished, the Pacific League returned to simply advancing their regular-season champion directly to the Japan Series. During this time, the PL's Seibu Lions won six Japan Series championship titles in seven seasons from the mid-1980s to the early-1990s. After the fall of the Lions in the mid-1990s, the league struggled to win championships against the Central League and lost three consecutive Japan Series to start the 2000s. Again fighting for its survival as its popularity faded, the PL board of directors agreed to reintroduce a playoff system to be used in the 2004 season to potentially create more regular-season excitement. The new postseason plan initiated a two-stage playoff in which the top three PL teams competed. In the First Stage, the teams that finished the season with the second- and third-best records played each other in a best-of-three series. The winner of this series faced the league's top finisher in the second, best-of-five stage. The winner of the Second Stage advanced to the Japan Series, where they competed against the CL's regular-season champion. After two years, the rules were changed to award the first-place team an automatic one-win advantage in the Second Stage. Though Central League officials initially criticized the plan, the PL's playoffs were a success and soon after the CL was criticized for not implementing a playoff system of their own.\nUnlike the Pacific League, the Central League had never experimented with any type of postseason system prior to 2006. They had situational playoff scenarios written into its bylaws in the event of an end-of-season tie, however, it never occurred and a permanent playoff plan had never been created. In 2006, encouraged by the success of the PL's postseason system, CL officials announced their intention to introduce playoffs for the 2007 season to help boost declining attendance. Later that year, PL and CL officials agreed on a unified postseason system. The CL implemented a playoff system identical to the PL's, and the entire playoff series was dubbed the Climax Series, NPB's current playoff format. The PL agreed to name the regular-season first-place finishers league champions rather than the team that won the leagues' respective playoffs—a reversal from the previous three seasons. The two leagues also agreed that neither regular-season champion should receive a one-game advantage in the Final Stage of the Climax Series. However, after one season, the leagues overturned their decision on the Final Stage advantage and agreed to award their champions a one-win advantage in the Final Stage starting with the 2008 Climax Series. At the same time, the Final Stage changed from a best-of-five series and became a best-of-seven series, where the first team to accumulate four wins advances to the Japan Series.\nPacific League playoffs.\nThe Pacific League (PL) first experimented with a type of end-of-season playoff system during the 1952 season. After the 108-game season had concluded, the teams with the four best winning percentages qualified to play in a twelve-game round robin stage in which each team would play three games against the other three qualifying teams. The results of these games were then added to the teams' regular-season results to determine the league's champion. After all 120 games had concluded, the Mainichi Orions and the Nankai Hawks both had 75 wins, however the Hawks had one less loss than the Orions because of a game against the Daiei Stars that ended in a tie earlier in the season. Because of the impact the tie had on the pennant race, the Hawks and the Stars played an extra 121st game. The Hawks won the game, giving them sole claim to Pacific League title and the right to represent the PL in the Japan Series. After the season, this faux playoff system was abandoned because of criticism that it was unfair to the three non-qualifying teams that had their seasons truncated.\nSplit season (1973–1982).\nDuring the Pacific League owners' meeting on November 20, 1972, a split season plan that included a potential genuine playoff series was approved for the 1973 season. Less popular and less profitable than Nippon Professional Baseball's (NPB) other league, the Central League (CL), the PL hoped that the new format would significantly increase fan interest. The season was divided into two, 65-game halves. The two teams that won each half went on to play each other in a five-game playoff series. The winner of the series was named the PL champion and went on to play the Central League (CL) champion in the Japan Series. \nPlayoff games under the split-season format were commercially successful and often played to sold-out crowds, a rare occurrence during the Pacific League's regular season. The format, however, had several problems and criticisms. While it did create two potential playoff races in one season, dead rubber games that had no playoff implications still resulted once a team clinched each half-season title. Furthermore, it allowed a team with only the third-best winning percentage for the full season to reach the playoffs and the Japan Series. The Seibu Lions' manager during the split-season format's final season, Tatsuro Hirooka, heavily criticized the playoff system for this reason. He believed teams could potentially abuse the format by focusing on the first half alone instead of the full season. Then, once a team became the first-half champion, it could rest players during the second half as their playoff berth had already been guaranteed. Another problem specific to the split-season format is that the playoff series was cancelled if one team won both half seasons. This occurred twice in the 1976 and 1978 seasons. These issues led to the format being scrapped after ten years and replaced for the 1983 season.\nResults.\nIn the 1973 season, the first year the system was implemented, the Nankai Hawks clinched a playoff berth by winning the first half of the season, however they finished the full season with only the third-best winning percentage in the league. It was the only example during the split-season era in which a team without the top-two highest winning percentages won the playoff series and advanced to the Japan Series. In the 1976 and 1978 seasons, the Hankyu Braves won both half-seasons nullifying the need for playoff series. Of the eight playoff series that were played, the first-half champion won five of them.\nFive-or-fewer games separation (1983–1985).\nIn 1983, the PL returned to a single, 130-game season, however if five or fewer games separated the first- and second-place teams at the end of the season, the two teams would play each other in a playoff series. The winner of the five-game series would be named the League champion and represent the PL in the Japan Series. This implemented a playoff system that was unpopular and uniformly ridiculed by most baseball media and fans. While the system removed the possibility of a team with a low regular-season winning percentage advancing to the Japan Series, it also removed the excitement of a close pennant race near the end of the season. It forced a winning team that narrowly beat its second-place competitor to try and defeat them again in a playoff series. The system only lasted for three seasons with a playoff series never needing to be played.\nPlayoffs (2004–2006; 2020).\nAfter the Pacific League abolished their first two playoff systems, the league returned to simply advancing their regular-season champion directly to the Japan Series. In this era before interleague play, the Pacific and Central Leagues vied for supremacy via the Japan Series. From the mid-1980s to the early-1990s, the PL's Seibu Lions entered their \"Golden Age\", winning six Japan Series titles in seven seasons. After the fall of the Lions in the mid-1990s, the Pacific League struggled to win championships against the Central League. To start the 2000s, the PL lost three consecutive Japan Series and was fighting for its survival as its popularity faded. When a first-place team had a substantial lead in the standings near the end of a regular season, there was no pennant race leading up to the Japan Series and fan interest and excitement waned. In an attempt to rectify this problem and increase the league's overall popularity, the PL board of directors agreed to reintroduce a playoff system to be used in the 2004 season to potentially create more regular-season excitement. The new postseason plan initiated a two-stage playoff in which the top three PL teams competed. In the First Stage, the teams that finished the newly shortened, 135-game regular season with the second- and third-best records played each other in a best-of-three series. The winner of this series faced the league's top finisher in the second, final stage. The Second Stage winner advanced to the Japan Series, where they competed against the CL's regular-season champion. Games could end in a tie if there was no winner after twelve innings. In a case that resulted in a series tie, the team that had the better head-to-head regular-season record advanced. The winner of the playoff series was named the Pacific League champion instead of the team that finished the regular season in first place. After the announcement, CL officials criticized the plan, with Giants' owner Tsuneo Watanabe going as far as to proclaim that if the PL team that placed third during the regular season advanced to the Japan Series, his team would refuse to play in the Series.\nOriginally, the first-place team at the end of the season was only supposed to receive home-field advantage throughout the Second Stage's best-of-five series. However, in August 2003, PL officials announced that if that team led the second-place team by more than five games at the end of the season, the top team would also receive a one-game winning advantage in addition to home-field advantage in the Second Stage. The first two years of this playoff system resulted in the first-place Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks missing out on the one-game advantage in the Second Stage by only a half game both seasons and losing both series as a result. Frustrated, SoftBank appealed to PL officials to revisit the rules. As a result, the PL removed the five-game lead requirement for the 2006 playoffs in favor of automatically awarding the first-place team the one-win advantage. In conjunction with this change, the first-place team no longer had home-field advantage for the entirety of the Second Stage; instead, the remaining four games were to be split evenly between both teams' stadiums. The venue rule change was a non-factor as the eventual first-place Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters clinched a Japan Series berth in two straight Second-Stage games against SoftBank with the help of the unconditional one-win advantage that the Hawks had helped to install.\nDuring the three years of the PL's playoff system, the winner of the PL's postseason tournament competed against the CL team who finished the regular season with the best record. The disparity between the two leagues' postseasons provoked some criticism from baseball analysts and insiders. During the 2005 Japan Series, \"The Japan Times\" Stephen Ellsesser called NPB's unbalanced postseason a \"bad system\" and believed that the CL's decision to not implement a playoff system of their own was \"foolish\". Citing the Hanshin Tigers' poor Japan Series performance, he speculated that the CL's lack of postseason play was a disadvantage. Ellsesser believed that the 17 days between their last regular-season game and the first Japan Series game did nothing to prepare the Tigers for the eventual championship series against the Chiba Lotte Marines, who had played continuously. Like Ellsesser, after seeing the \"excitement\" that the 2004 PL Playoffs caused, then-Marines manager Bobby Valentine was \"incredulous that the Central League didn’t follow suit\" and create a playoff series of their own.\nThe second stage of this playoff format was used in the 2020 season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nResults.\nThe first two years of the Pacific League Playoffs both saw the second-seeded team winning both Stages and advancing on to the Japan Series. In the third and final year, the third-seeded Hawks won the First Stage. With the Second Stage rules changed to grant the top-seeded Fighters a one-win advantage, the Fighters were the first top-seeded team to win the Pacific League title during this playoff plan.\nClimax Series (2007–present).\nUnlike the Pacific League, the Central League had never experimented with any type of postseason system prior to 2006. The CL had situational playoff scenarios written into its bylaws that required either a tie atop the standings or a team finishing with more wins but a worse winning percentage than the first-place team, but a permanent playoff plan had never been created. In March 2006, encouraged by the success of the PL's postseason system, CL officials announced their intention to introduce playoffs for the 2007 season to help boost declining attendance. During meetings held later that year, PL and CL officials disagreed over proposed plans detailing the new playoff system. Since the creation of the PL playoffs in 2004, the league awarded its pennant titles to the playoff winners rather than the team who finished the regular season with the best record. The PL disapproved of the CL's intentions to continue awarding their league title to the first-place finisher in the regular season while using the playoffs to determine which team would compete against in the Japan Series.\nIn September 2006, both leagues agreed on a unified postseason system. The CL implemented a playoff system identical to the PL's, and the entire playoff series was dubbed the \"Climax Series\". The PL agreed to name the regular season first-place finishers league champions rather than the team that won the leagues' respective playoffs—a reversal from the previous three seasons. It was decided that both leagues would play 144 regular-season games, the first time both leagues would play the same number of games since the PL introduced its playoff system in 2004. The two leagues also agreed that neither regular-season champion should receive a one-game advantage in the Final Stage of the Climax Series, claiming that it was unnecessary from a business point of view. It had been suggested that the Yomiuri Giants voted to approve the playoff idea in 2006 because they had not finished atop the standings in the regular season since 2002 and the playoff concept would increase the Giants' chances of winning the Japan Series. However, the plan backfired on them. In the Climax Series' inaugural season, the Giants finally won the CL pennant but were still denied a Japan Series berth when they were defeated by the second-place Chunichi Dragons in a three-game sweep during the Final Stage of the 2007 Central League Climax Series. The next season, the leagues overturned their decision on the Final Stage advantage and agreed to award their champions an automatic one-win advantage in the Final Stage starting with the 2008 Climax Series. At the same time, the Final Stage changed from a best-of-five series and became a best-of-seven series, where the first team to accumulate four wins advances to the Japan Series."

        "text": "The International Ski Federation (FIS) Alpine Ski World Cup was the premier circuit for alpine skiing competition. The inaugural season launched in January 1967, and the season marked the 55th consecutive year for the FIS World Cup. As it had every year since 2006 (when the Sölden races were cancelled due to a snowstorm), the season began in Sölden, Austria in October, and it ended with the World Cup finals in March, which were held in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced many changes to the original racing schedule. Among them were the following:\nCanceled events: Val d'Isere (AC); St. Anton (AC); Crans-Montana (AC); Levi (Men); Lech (Team); Lake Louise (3 DH, 2 SG); Alta Badia (P); Davos (P), Beaver Creek (DH, SG, GS); Chamonix (DH, P); Bansko (AC); Bormio (AC); Wengen (DH, SL, AC); Maribor (SL) and Åre (GS).\nLadies' calendar changes: Killington to Levi (SL); Killington to Courchevel (GS); Lake Louise to Val d'Isere (DH); Lake Louise to St. Moritz (SG); Åre to Maribor (GS); Maribor to Åre (SL) and Lake Louise to Crans-Montana (DH).\nMen's calendar changes: Beaver Creek to Val d'Isere (GS, SG, DH); Val d'Isere to Alta Badia (SL): Garmisch to Adelboden (GS): Lake Louise to Wengen (DH); Lake Louise to Ga-Pa (SG) and Levi to Chamonix (SL). \nAdditional events: Chamonix (SL); Bansko (GS); Bormio (SG), St. Anton (SG) and Val d'Isere (Ladies' SG).\nFurther changes due to the pandemic were considered likely and are shown on the schedule below. However, two results of these COVID-related changes were that (1) no Alpine combined events were held during the season, despite the increased emphasis placed on such events beginning with the prior season, and (2) no World Cup races were held in North America for the first time since the 1973-74 season and only the second time in World Cup history.\nNations Cup.\nOverall\nMen\nLadies\nPrize money.\nTop-5 men\nTop-5 ladies\nRetirements.\nThe following athletes announced their retirements during or after the season:"

        "text": "2020 Remote Darts League, shortly RDL, was a darts tournament - the first edition in its history. The tournament was developed by Farawaysports, an organisation dedicated to providing quality remote sporting contests including pictures, data and odds, during the world-wide pandemic of COVID-19. Similar to the Premier League in terms of format, the Remote Darts League sees every player face off against each other with each player gaining points in order to play in finals night. James Richardson became the first winner, defeating Paul Hogan 10–3 in the final.\nFormat.\nThe RDL comprises 10 top WDF players competing over 10 days in a fast league format. Players all play each other once over nine nights with five matches taking place each evening. Each match will play out over a maximum of 12 legs with the first player to reach seven legs winning the fixture and picking up two league points. As its best of 12 legs this allows for the possibility of a match to be tied at 6-6, in this case each player will receive one point. After nine nights each player will have played each other and the four players with the highest number of league points will qualify for the final night showdown. On final night the Top 4 battle it out in two semi-finals and a grand final for the right to be crowned the first Remote Darts League champion. After a four-day break, the 10 players will compete again in the next leg of the Remote Darts League, RDL2.\nVenues.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and regulations from the government, all players play from their home. All players have a webcam prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. The referee, Richard Ashdown, confirms the score. Viewers see both dartboards at the same time, along with the scoreboard and the referee.\nPlayers.\nThe 10 WDF players have been chosen in advance including the former BDO World champion, John Walton or the finalist of the UK Open 2011 and European Championships 2012, Wes Newton.\nTable and streaks.\nTable.\nTwo points are awarded for a win and one point for a draw. When players are tied on points, leg difference is used first as a tie-breaker, after that legs won against throw and then tournament average.\nAfter the nine rounds, top 4 players qualify for the semifinals, where the first will play with the fourth and the second with the third.\n(Q) = Qualified For The Playoffs\n(E) = Eliminated From Playoff Contention"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Mean Green represent the University of North Texas in the NCAA's American Athletic Conference.\nNorth Texas began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1916. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but North Texas's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Noel Dawn Johnson (December 1, 1972 – June 9, 2020) was an American basketball player and the head coach of the Midwestern State Mustangs women's basketball team. She played for the national championship Texas Tech Lady Raiders in 1993.\nEarly years.\nJohnson was a West Texas native, born in Shamrock, Texas, to Dean and Agatha Johnson, and then growing up in Kelton, Texas. During her junior year in high school, her family moved to Nazareth, Texas, where she played basketball for Nazareth High. She helped her team win two class 1-A state titles in basketball.\nCollege.\nJohnson attended Texas Tech University and played for four years on the women's basketball team. The Lady Raiders won the Southwest Conference all four years, were invited to the NCAA postseason tournament all four years, making it at least as far as the Sweet Sixteen each year, and won the national championship in 1993. The team was coached by Marsha Sharp who would go on to be inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.\nJohnson played point guard during her four years at Texas Tech. In the first nine years that Texas Tech played in the Southwest conference, they finished second or third each year. In Johnson's freshman year, the team recorded a record of 27–5 and won the first of five consecutive conference championships. Sheryl Swoopes had transferred to Texas Tech from South Plains College, and the team went on to earn a first round bye in the NCAA tournament in 1992, then beating Santa Clara in the second round to reach the Sweet 16. They lost the next game to Stanford who went on to win the national championship that year. They ended the season ranked number 12 in the AP rankings, their highest ever ranking. In her freshman year Johnson hit 23 of her 53 point field-goal attempts resulting in a percentage of 46.0%, the highest on the team.\nIn her sophomore year, the team again won the Southwest conference regular-season tournament and the postseason tournament. The team earned the second seed in the West regional of the 1993 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament behind the previous year's national champion Stanford. However, Colorado upset Stanford in the regional semi finals. Texas Tech earned a first-round bye then beat Washington by six points in the second round, and went on to beat Southern California by 20 points in the regional semi-finals. they faced Colorado in the regional finals but won easily by 25 points sending Texas Tech to the first-ever Final Four. In the national semi finals, Texas Tech faced Vanderbilt, also appearing in the first Final Four but won easily 60–46. The championship game was against Ohio State who had won their national semi final in overtime. While the star of the championship game was clearly Swoopes, who scored an NCAA record 47 points in the game, Johnson hit four free throws to give Texas Tech an eight-point lead with only 20 seconds left to play. Those free throws were key, as Ohio State hit two three pointers in the final 10 seconds.

        "text": "The Vermont Catamounts men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Vermont Catamounts men's basketball program in various categories, including points, three-pointers, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Catamounts represent the University of Vermont in the NCAA's America East Conference.\nVermont began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1900. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Vermont's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

However, as in many other sports, it was mainly talked about. However, in 2006 it all became more concrete. A system was devised to better frame the friendly matches from the preparation period, and a knock-out system was set up: quarter-finals in round-trip matches between the top 4 from Belgium and the Netherlands, and the winners would compete in a Final 4. At the end of 2007 it was announced that eight teams from the Netherlands and Belgium would compete against each other. The goal was to start a full Bene Liga competition in 2010 with more teams from the Low Countries.\nThe first edition of the Bene Liga was played in 2008 as a kind of cup formula.

        "title": "Landon Turner (basketball)",
        "text": "Landon Montel Turner (born September 30, 1960) is an American former basketball player. He played college basketball for the Indiana Hoosiers and won an NCAA championship as a junior in 1981. Hoosiers head coach Bob Knight considered Turner to have the potential to be the best player he ever coached. Primed for a breakthrough senior season and considered a top National Basketball Association (NBA) draft pick, Turner's basketball career came to an end when he was paralyzed from the chest down in a car accident in July 1981. He stayed with the Hoosiers as a team captain during the 1981–82 season before the Boston Celtics honored Turner by selecting him as the final pick of the 1982 NBA draft. He played wheelchair basketball for three years before he embarked on a career as a motivational speaker. Turner is a member of the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame and the Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame.\nEarly life and high school career.\nTurner was born on September 30, 1960, to Adell and Rita Turner. His father competed in track and played football; he received an athletic scholarship to play football for the Purdue Boilermakers but dropped out. Turner considers his father to be his biggest influence as an athlete.\nTurner played basketball at Arsenal Technical High School – the same school as his father. He grew from during his freshman year to in his sophomore year, when he also developed the ability to slam dunk. During his senior season, Turner emerged as a star prospect and set an Arsenal Tech season record for points with 616 while he averaged 21.4 points and 15.8 rebounds per game. Turner was named a \"Parade\" All-American and played in the 1978 McDonald's All-American Game as the only player from Indiana.\nCollege career.\nTurner received 300 letters of college offers, but narrowed his choices down to the Indiana Hoosiers and the Purdue Boilermakers in his home state so his parents could attend his games. His father was a fan of the Hoosiers and their head coach Bob Knight, and Turner committed to play for the Hoosiers under Knight in the fall of 1978. Having heard about Knight's relentlessness as a coach, Turner was surprised by his \"calm demeanor\" during a home visit and jokingly considered Knight to be \"a demon in disguise\". Once Turner joined the Hoosiers, Knight was so hard on him that he considered quitting the team during his freshman season. Hoosiers teammate Steve Risley believed Knight saw more potential in Landon than anyone else but saw him making less of an effort. Knight thought Turner could be the best player he coached and the greatest Hoosiers player ever but became increasingly frustrated by his lack of growth. At the conclusion of his sophomore season, Knight was so annoyed by Turner's casual attitude that he told him to quit the team and play professionally. Turner persisted with the Hoosiers but his grades dropped as he attended parties instead of studying, which led to his benching by Knight during his junior season. Knight believed that Turner \"couldn't think past tomorrow\" and grew increasingly frustrated by his lack of willingness to apply himself completely in practices. After Turner restored his grades and Knight saw improvement in his playing, he was returned to the starting line-up with a few games left in the Big Ten Conference, where he helped the team remain undefeated for the rest of the season. During the 1981 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament, Turner formed a formidable trio with guard Isiah Thomas and center Ray Tolbert who were considered to be the Hoosiers' best players. In the final game of the tournament, the Hoosiers defeated the North Carolina Tar Heels 63–50 to win the NCAA championship. Turner was named to the all-tournament team.\nWith the graduation of Tolbert and the draft declaration of Thomas, Turner was expected to be the cornerstone of the Hoosiers during the 1981–82 season. Knight believed Turner could have been the best player in the country during his senior season while Boston Celtics general manager Red Auerbach had expected him to be a top-five selection in the 1982 NBA draft. Thomas compared Turner to James Worthy and thought \"he had all the makings of being a great power forward.\"\nParalysis.\nOn the morning of July 26, 1981, Turner was driving on Indiana State Road 46 near Columbus, Indiana, when his car lost control on a curve and flipped. He was driving to the Kings Island amusement park in Ohio with three friends, who were all also injured in the crash. Turner had not been wearing a seat belt when he crashed. Turner was taken to Bartholomew County Hospital in Columbus before he was transferred to Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital later that same day. Knight, who was on a summer fishing vacation in Idaho, flew back to Indiana to be with Turner and his family. He was also visited in hospital by Thomas, who remarked to teammate Randy Wittman: \"If I knew this was going to happen, I wouldn't have left\". Turner fractured his spine and felt \"some paralysis in his hands and legs\" after the accident. With the injury low in his back, Turner eventually had the full use of his arms and hands return but his legs were permanently paralyzed. Turner stayed in hospital for four months before he returned to his parents' house. During his recovery time, Turner and Knight developed a close relationship that was considered to be like that of a father and son. Knight named Turner as team captain of the Hoosiers for the 1981–82 season.\nKnight organized a national campaign to create the Landon Turner Trust Fund that helped raise $400,000 to pay for Turner's medical bills. Thomas staged an all-star basketball game in 1981 that helped raise an additional $90,000. The Boston Celtics honoured Turner by selecting him as the 225th and final selection of the 1982 NBA draft at the suggestion of Knight, who had mentioned it in a conversation with Celtics general manager Red Auerbach and head coach Bill Fitch at an NBA instructional camp a month prior. Knight considered the gesture \"a beautiful thing\" by the Celtics and subsequently called Auerbach \"one of the class people in sports.\" After finding out he had been drafted, Turner jocularly sent a telegram to Auerbach that read: \"When do I report for tryout?\" Auerbach stayed in contact with Turner and sent him two championship watches when the Celtics won the NBA Finals in 1984 and 1986.\nLife after basketball.\nTurner sued the Ford Motor Company in 1983 and claimed that the roof of his 1973 Ford LTD offered him no protection during his accident. He requested compensation for his medical expenses and lost earnings from a professional career. Turner signed an out-of-court settlement with Ford for an undisclosed amount in 1985.\nUpon the insistence of Knight, Turner returned to Indiana University Bloomington (IU) to complete his physical education degree in 1983. He had to attend some classes at Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) due to his inability to mount the stairs for his classrooms at IU. Turner graduated in 1984. That same year, he was employed by IU as coordinator of minority affairs and held that position until 1988.\nTurner began playing wheelchair basketball for the Circle City Knight Riders, who were affiliated with the Indiana Pacers, in 1987. He was initially reluctant to play wheelchair basketball because he could not play like he used to but joined at the insistence of the Knight Riders' founder Tony Williams. Turner was selected for the Most Courageous Award by the United States Basketball Writers Association in 1989 for his basketball comeback. He played wheelchair basketball for three years but quit because he did not have the same love for the game.\nTurner founded a motivational speaking business, Landon Turner Enterprises Inc., in 1989. He speaks at schools and churches about disability awareness, the story of his life and gaining acceptance. Turner wrote a book titled \"Landon Turner's Tales from the 1980–81 Indiana Hoosiers\" about his season-long struggles with the championship-winning team that also features a foreword by Knight.\nTurner was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 2007 and the Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2012."

Including the predecessor competition, the original European Challenge Cup, this was the 25th edition of European club rugby's second-tier competition. \nThe tournament began in December 2020. The final, originally scheduled to be held at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, took place on 21 May 2021 at Twickenham Stadium.\nOn 11 January 2021 EPCR announced the competition was suspended temporarily due to new restrictions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. A revised format to finish the tournament was announced on 24 February 2021.\nTeams.\nFourteen teams will qualified for the 2020–21 European Challenge Cup from Premiership Rugby, the Pro14 and the Top 14, as a direct result of their domestic league performance having not qualified for the Heineken Champions Cup. Although, the two South African Pro14 teams are not eligible.\nThe distribution of teams was:\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nPreliminary stage.\nTeams were placed into one of the two tiers, with the higher ranked clubs being put in Tier 1. The nature of the tier system meant that no draw was needed this year. Brackets show each team's ranking and their league. e.g. \"9 Top 14\" indicates the team was the ninth placed team from the Top 14.\nThe preliminary stage would consist of a single pool of 14 teams. No team would play a team in the same tier and no club would play another club from the same league. Each team was scheduled to play four matches with the top eight teams advancing to the knockout stage. The top eight teams were due to be joined in the round of 16 by the teams finishing between 5th and 8th in each pool of the 2020–21 European Rugby Champions Cup pool stage.\nThe revised format announced in February 2021 would see the top 8 teams after 2 pool games advance to the round of 16 along with the eight teams placed between 9th and 12th in each pool of the Champions Cup.\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage commenced with a round of 16 consisting of the top 8 ranked teams from the preliminary stage and the teams placed between 9th and 12th in each Champions Cup pool. Due to the truncation of the preliminary stage, a draw was used to determine matches in both round of 16 and quarter-finals but no team would face a team from the same league in the round of 16. Teams which won both their matches and were not awarded points due to COVID cancellations would be guaranteed home advantage. Therefore, Leicester Tigers, London Irish and Ospreys received home advantage.\nThe draw for the round of 16 and quarter-finals took place on 9 March 2021 in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nRound of 16.\nFixtures were announced on 16 March 2021.\nSemi-finals.\nThe draw for the semi-finals took place on 11 April 2021 at BT Sport's studios in London."

For 2022 all six scheduled tournaments were included in the LETAS.\nThe SGT for women was named the Swedish Golf Tour 1986–1990, the Lancome Tour 1991–1994, the Telia Infomedia Golf Tour 1995–1997, the Telia Tour 1998–2008, the SAS Masters Tour 2008–2009, the Nordea Tour 2010–2016 and the Swedish Golf Tour 2017–2020. From 2021, the Swedish Golf Tour was included in and synonymous with the Nordic Golf Tour. For 2022, the tour was, for sponsor reasons, named the Ahlsell Nordic Golf Tour.\nThe Swedish Golf Tour for men is run by the same organization and is from 2020 named the MoreGolf Mastercard Tour.\nHistory.\nAt the beginning of 1979, Kärstin Ehrnlund became the first Swedish female tournament professional. The following year, Ehrnlund became the first Swedish winner on an international professional golf tour, when she won on the Ladies European Tour (LET) (at the time named the WPGA Tour) and by this showed the possibility for talented Swedish female golfers to turn playing professionals.\nThe first professional tournament for women held in Sweden and also the first LET tournament in Sweden, was an invitational tournament named the Volvo International taking place at Albatross Golf Club in Gothenburg in 1980 and again in 1981.\nAt the annual meeting of the Swedish Golf Federation in March 1983, \"open golf\" was introduced, which meant that, from next year both amateurs and professionals were allowed to enter all domestic competitions, international amateur tournaments excluded. Non-PGA members with a licence, as well as PGA members, were allowed to receive prize money. The new and internationally unique rules, made it possible to transform the traditionally most important amateur tournaments in the country to professional tournaments, attractive to sponsors and players.\nThe next Ladies European Tour tournament held in Sweden, took place at Mölle Golf Club in Mölle in 1984 and was named the Höganäs Ladies Open.\nThe women's Swedish Golf Tour, designed to help Swedish golfers to reach the standard of play needed to qualify for the LET, was established in 1986, two years after the men's tour in the country. The women's tour consisted the first year of seven tournaments, two of them co-sanctioned with the Ladies' European Tour. Liselotte Neumann was the first Order-of-Merit winner, thanks to second-place finishes in both of the two co-sanctioned events.\nIn 1988, a company, Svenska Golftourerna AB, was founded, owned equally by the PGA of Sweden and the Swedish Golf Federation, to organize the two Swedish Golf Tours for men and women. Its first chairperson was Ola Öqvist.\nOfficial Feeder Tour to LET.\nIn 2005, the women's SGT became the first official feeder tour for the LET, with the two leading non-exempt players from the ranking gaining LET cards for the following season, and the remainder of the top ten exempted into the final stage of the LET Qualifying School. In 2012, the tour was replaced as the LET's feeder tour by the newly created LET Access Series.\nFrom 2018, the women's SGT was run by the Swedish Golf Federation.\nNordic Golf Tour.\nFor 2020, in cooperation between the Golf Federations of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, the Ladies' Nordic Golf Tour (NGT) was introduced, with its Order-of merit ranking named Road to Creekhouse Ladies Open, including eight tournaments in three countries, six of them to be counted in the LETAS. This meant that the women's SGT remained, but on the level below the NGT.\nHowever, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the events outside Sweden were cancelled and the remaining Swedish events were removed from the 2020 LET Access Series (LETAS) schedule. Two of the five scheduled tournaments to be held in Sweden went ahead, but with a reduced purse.\nFrom 2021, the Swedish Golf Tour was included in and synonymous with the Nordic Golf Tour.\nOrder of Merit (SGT only) winners.\nSources:"

The venue was used to cooperate with restrictions caused by the COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom.\nTowards the end of October, World Snooker Tour had announced that the UK Championship would have the first round played at the same arena, but all televised stages would then be played at the York Barbican: on 4 November, days after the UK Government announced a lockdown for all of England, this was then revised to include the entire tournament.\nDespite space being allocated for back-to-back events in China during March, WST later confirmed on 3 December 2020 that all China-based tournaments were cancelled, due to continuing travel restrictions, making it the first season in more than a decade where no tournaments would be staged in Asia. In its place, a new WST Pro Series was added, taking place between January and March 2021.\nOn 4 January 2021, the week prior to the event, WST announced that the Masters would be moved to the Marshall Arena, as a result of logistical challenges associated with Alexandra Palace having no on-site facilities and lengthy travel requirements from a hotel, preventing a secure 'bubble' from being formed to host the event.\nOn 26 January 2021, World Snooker Tour announced that the Welsh Open would become the first event that season to be played outside the Marshall Arena, at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport. This was made possible due to a Covid-bubble being able to be created with similar on-site accommodation facilities, meaning players were able to stay within the bubble while playing in the event. Later in the season, World Snooker confirmed that the 2021 Tour Championship event would be played at Celtic Manor as the final event of the season prior to the World Championship at the Crucible Theatre.\nOn 13 March 2021, World Snooker announced that the World Snooker Championship would welcome a limited number of fans, as part of an Events Research Programme run by the government. The programme intends to test a variety of settings to generate evidence on how fans may be safely welcomed into sporting events in future, with the Crucible Theatre providing evidence of a \"theatre setting\".\nOn 20 April 2021, towards the start of the World Championship, it was announced that Barry Hearn would step down as Chairman of the World Snooker Tour and as President of Matchroom Sport. Steve Dawson will replace Hearn as the Chairman of the World Snooker Tour after the conclusion of the season, although Hearn will remain in an advisory position on tour.\nPlayers.\nThe World Snooker Tour in the 2020–21 season consists of a field of 128 professional players. The top 64 players from the prize money rankings after the 2020 World Championship, and the 35 players earning a two-year card the previous year automatically qualify for the season. Next, four places are allocated to the top four on the One Year Ranking List who have not already qualified for the Main Tour. Another two players came from the Challenge Tour, two players came from the CBSA China Tour, and a further 12 places were available through the Q School, four from each of the three events. Two-year tour cards were also awarded to any player outside the top 64, who qualified for the main stage of the 2020 World Snooker Championship at the Crucible. The rest of the places on to the tour came from amateur events.\nNew professional players.\nAll players listed below received a tour card for two seasons.\nEBSA European Championship winner: Andrew Pagett (\"deferred\")\nOne Year Ranking List\nCalendar.\nThe following tables outline the dates and results for all the events of the World Snooker Tour and the World Seniors Tour.\nWorld ranking points.\nThe 2020–21 snooker season featured the following points distribution for World Snooker Tour ranking events:"

        "text": "The Hobart–Syracuse lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between Hobart Statesmen and Syracuse Orange. The two programs, both based in Upstate New York, developed one of the most historically-relevant rivalries in lacrosse. The rivalry trails only the Cornell–Hobart and Johns Hopkins–Maryland rivalries as the third-oldest series in lacrosse. The Statesmen and Orange have combined for 32 national championships, with the two maintaining annual nature of the rivalry, even after the NCAA split into separate divisions. During the 1970s through the 1990s, Hobart competed in Divisions II and III, while Syracuse competed in Division I. Both programs dominated their respective divisions during this period, with Hobart capturing 15 national championships during this period and the Orange claiming 6. In 1995, Hobart promoted its team from Division III to Division I to preserve the series with the Orange and its other upstate rival Cornell. In 2008, the annual rivalry was jeopardized when Hobart's board of trustees voted to reclassify its lacrosse program back to the Division III level. After an emotional reaction from the alumni community, however, the decision was reversed on May 1. Syracuse leads the series, described as a classic \"David versus Goliath\" contest, 81–26–2 through 2024.\nSeries History.\nEarly Years (Pre-1970s).\nThe series dates back to April 29, 1916 with a Hobart victory over the Orange. After three consecutive victories by the Statesmen, Syracuse asserted dominance over the rivalry, with only one Hobart victory breaking up a 21 game unbeaten streak. The two would trade blows from 1937 to 1951, with Syracuse taking eight of sixteen matchups during this stretch. Another string of Orange victories with 11 straight victories was ended by an 11–10 Hobart win, the first of four straight victories for the Statesmen. Syracuse would follow with their own four game streak, ending in 1972.\nDivisional Golden Years (1970s to 1990s).\nThe introduction of the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship in 1971 changed course for the rivalry. Syracuse remained in Division I, while the Statesmen began competing at the Division II level in 1974, before eventually moving to Division III in 1980. With Jerry Schmidt at the helm, the Statesmen would embark on the beginning of its greatest era in program history. In 1972, Hobart would rout the Orange 18–7 in Geneva, en route to their first ever national championship, claimed after prevailing in the USILA playoffs. That victory marked the first of eight consecutive triumphs in the rivalry, with only one game coming within six goals. Five Hobart's victories came with Syracuse ranked, including twice when the Orange were in the Top 10. Hobart would win two more national championships under Jerry Schmidt, accompanied by three title game runner-ups during this period.\nIn 1980, Syracuse would regain momentum. After their first NCAA tournament appearance the previous year, the #4 Orange got payback for Hobart dominance, winning 22–13. At the Division III level, new head coach Dave Urick led the Statesmen to their first of 12 consecutive national championships, beginning with the 1980 season. A thrilling contest the following year result in an overtime victory for the Orange. A Hobart win in 1982 was followed by Syracuse's 17–10 victory in '83, as the Orange won their first national championship since 1957.\nThe Kraus-Simmons trophy was introduced in 1986, named for two Hall of Fame coaches, Roy Simmons Sr. for Syracuse and Babe Kraus for Hobart. The 1986 game was a watershed for the rivalry, as the Statesmen upset the #1 Orange 16–13 in Geneva. The game took place before a crowd of 8,450 at Boswell Field, despite it only officially seating 4,500. Hobart completed its best season record-wise since the undefeated 1977 campaign, finishing at 15–1 and winning a seventh consecutive Division III title.\nIn the following years, Syracuse would continue its dominance of Division I while Hobart held put in the lower division. In 1987, Syracuse would avenge its upset from the prior year with a five goal differential. This would be the first of a series-record 19 straight victories for the Orange, as they captured five more championships under Hall of Fame coach Roy Simmons Jr. The Statesmen would be unable to compete with the Orange, losing by 14 in 1994. That season would be Hobart's last in the lower divisions, as the program reclassified to Division I in an effort to preserve its rivalries with Syracuse and Cornell, though it would become one of the few non-Division I teams to play at the level without the use of athletic scholarships.\nRecent Years (1995 to Present).\nUnder coach B.J. O'Hara, the Statesmen would begin their first season in Division I in 1995 with three more championships in tow after the departure of Urick. The 1995 game featured renewed energy and fervor, as the #4 Orange nipped the #18 Statesmen 18 to 17 in what would be the highest scoring game until the 2020 edition. The game would be a ranked affair for four of five meetings, highlighted by another narrow Syracuse win in 1997, an overtime result. Nonetheless, Hobart was unable to knock off the Orange during this stretch, as they made their first four appearances in the Division I tournament.\nSyracuse edged past a ranked Hobart yet again in the 91st meeting but the following year, the Statesmen would snap the streak on the road, pulling out a 9–8 victory, their first since 1986. Two years later, in 2008, the annual series was almost cancelled by a decision from Hobart's board of trustees, which voted to reclassify back to Division III. Emotional resistance from alumni halted the process and Hobart chose to remain at Division I in men's lacrosse.\nHobart would again defeat Syracuse in 2013, the 99th meeting in the rivalry's storied history. The Orange would go on to finish the season as the national runner-up. However, the 100th would go the way of Syracuse. Five years later, the game would be a ranked matchup again, with Syracuse topping the Statesmen 17 to 5. Since Hobart's most recent victory in 2013, Syracuse has won the last ten to extend its series lead to 81–26–2. Nonetheless, the game usually remains a competitive fixture, as current Orange coach John Desko describes it as a \"throw the records right out the window [type of game.] They always play well against Syracuse.\"\nRival Accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs as of 2020 season."

The team got to work preparing for the three game series with Princeton that would open their season. After arriving in Pittsburgh, however, the Tigers were the ones who appeared ready by winning the first two games. One aspect both teams had to adjust to was the large size of the rink, far larger than either typically experienced. Yale did finally acclimate in the third game but the team knew they had work ahead of them.\nYale officially opened its intercollegiate season with decisive wins over Mass Ag. and MIT but were once more beaten by Princeton, despite a valiant effort from York in goal.\nA game that was scheduled against Cornell was cancelled. Rather than lose the game time, the team had a rematch with the New Haven Arena Team and won another lopsided game. After getting shelled by the Boston Athletic Association, Yale faced Dartmouth and the two team battled intensely to a 3–3 tie after 40 minutes. The teams agreed that the first to score would be the winner but it wouldn't be until the third overtime session that Washburn tilted the scales in Yale's favor.\nThe first game against Harvard came next and, while the Elis were playing well, the Crimson had allowed just one goal in their previous five games combined (all wins). The trend continued as Yale was unable to solve Wylde and lost 0–2. The team rebounded in the next game, blanking Williams 5–0 for the Bulldogs' first shutout in over two years. The team was in such control of the game that they played a majority of their substitutes throughout the contest, including in goal.\nYale faced Princeton in a rematch with three of its regulars ruled ineligible. Despite the handicap, a masterful performance by York and a hat-trick from Gould gave the Elis the win 3–1 and set up a rubber match a few days later. The game was rough but clean and Yale defeated Princeton for the series win, their second victory over the Tigers in as many years. The second match with Harvard went much as the first had, however, Yale was able to score twice against Wylde, something no other college was able to do that year.\nWith both a coach and an assistant coach, no team manager was needed.\nSchedule and 5esults.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Sun Devils represent Arizona State University in the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference.\nArizona State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1911. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Arizona State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Six best gymnasts on the apparatus in the team competition (by sum of two scores - for compulsory and optional routine) qualified for that apparatus finals. The new feature of the competition was in women's events: each of them was judged by four judges, like men's ones. The highest and lowest marks were dropped and an average of two remaining marks constituted the score.\nEach nation entered a team of six gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The top five individual scores in each exercise (that is, compulsory floor, voluntary floor, compulsory vault, etc.) were added to give a team score for that exercise. The 12 team exercise scores were summed to give a team total.\nNo separate finals were contested for the team all-around.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, apparatus scores from 0 to 20, individual totals from 0 to 120, and team scores from 0 to 600. \nResults.\nAfter Japan won the team gold, Eizo Kenmotsu became the youngest ever Japanese male gymnast to win an Olympic gold medal. He was 20 years, 8 months and 11 days old, and would hold on to this record for almost 50 years until Kenzo Shirai broke it in 2016, becoming also Japan‘s only teenage male gymnast to do so at this level.\nThe men's artistic gymnastics all-around team event Olympic final took place on 24 October 1968."

While the Bulldogs had coaches in years past, Rocque is cited as the first official coach in team history. Rocque, who had previously coached Dartmouth, substituted his player much more than the team had previously and would commonly have players perform at multiple positions in the same game. This tactic helped prevent the Elis from flagging at the end of games, something they had trouble with in recent years.\nYale had their best season in 18 years, posting a .714 winning percentage in 14 games. More importantly, the Elis won the season series against Harvard for the first time since 1908. The Bulldogs two overtime losses to Princeton cost them, however, as the series loss left all three teams in a three-way tie in the IHL and prevented any team from claiming the Intercollegiate Championship for 1917.\nAfter the season the United States officially entered World War I.

        "text": "Damien Stephon Lewis (born March 21, 1997) is an American football guard for the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at LSU. He was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round of the 2020 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nLewis grew up in Biloxi, Mississippi and Atlanta before moving to Canton, Mississippi, where he attended Canton High School. Projected not to qualify academically to play Division I football, Lewis received no offers from four-year colleges coming out of high school.\nCollege career.\nLewis enrolled at Northwest Mississippi Community College after receiving a scholarship. He was named a second-team Junior College All-American in both of his seasons at Northwest Mississippi. He graduated a semester early and committed to transfer to LSU to continue his collegiate career over offers from Ole Miss, Kentucky, South Carolina, and West Virginia.\nLewis was named the Tigers starting right guard going into his first season at LSU and started all 13 of the team's games.

He logged 967 offensive snaps, including snaps in a game in Week 11 against the Arizona Cardinals where he was the emergency center. In pass protection ratings, Lewis did well, allowing just 28 total pressures in 633 pass blocking snaps. However, he did accumulate 12 penalties, which led all NFL guards. In terms of run blocking, however, Lewis was one of the best in the league. He received an 81.5 overall run blocking score from Pro Football Focus, second only to Indianapolis Colts All-Pro and Pro Bowler Quenton Nelson. After a strong rookie year, Lewis was named to the Pro Football Writers Association's NFL All-Rookie Team.\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn March 13, 2024, Lewis signed a four-year contract with the Carolina Panthers."

He previously played for the Illinois Fighting Illini and LSU Tigers.\nHigh school career.\nIn his freshman season, Miller played basketball for Manual High School in Peoria, Illinois. For his final three years of high school, he transferred to Morgan Park High School in Chicago due to his mother getting a new teaching job in the area. As a sophomore, Miller averaged 15 points per game, helping his team win the Class 3A state title. In his junior season, he averaged 29 points, 7.3 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game and was named Illinois Gatorade Player of the Year. As a senior, Miller averaged 27.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 2.3 steals per game, leading Morgan Park to the Class 3A sectional final. He was named Illinois Mr. Basketball and repeated as Illinois Gatorade Player of the Year.\nRecruiting.\nOn November 21, 2019, Miller announced his commitment to play college basketball for Illinois over offers from Arizona and Louisville, among others.\nCollege career.\nIn his freshman debut on November 25, 2020, Miller scored a season-high 28 points, shooting 10-of-12 from the field and 6-of-8 from three-point range, in a 122–60 win over North Carolina A&amp;T.

On October 20, 2021, it was announced that Miller had torn his ACL and would miss the season. Miller returned from injury and started for LSU the following season.\nAfter the 22-23 season ended, Miller transferred again, this time to Arizona State University. Due to transferring a second time without a degree, Miller required a waiver from the NCAA to play the 23-24 season. The NCAA denied Miller's waiver and thus deemed him ineligible to play. Because of this, Miller appeared due to miss the season, however the transfer eligibility rule was put on hold for the rest of the season, allowing Miller to participate.\nNational team career.\nMiller represented the United States at the 2021 FIBA Under-19 World Cup in Latvia. He averaged 7.4 points and 3.6 assists per game, helping his team win the gold medal."

        "title": "Loyola–Towson lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Loyola–Towson lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between Baltimore's Loyola Greyhounds of the Patriot League and Towson Tigers of the Colonial Athletic Association. The teams first met in 1959 and competed at the NCAA Division II level until transferring up to Division I in 1980 for Towson and in 1982 for Loyola. The two programs share locations on Charles Street and are separated by only four and a half miles. They also share cross-street rivalries with foe Johns Hopkins (see Johns Hopkins–Loyola lacrosse rivalry). Successful in Division II, both the Greyhounds and Tigers have had success at the national level in the first division since moving up. Loyola has appeared in four Final Fours and won the 2012 national title, while Towson has appeared in three final fours of their own, in addition to their 1974 Division II championship. Through 2024, Loyola leads the series by a 36–31 margin, the most-played opponent for both schools.\nSeries History.\nDivision II Years (1959 to 1981).\nThe series began in 1959, ending in a two-goal victory for the Greyhounds. Since that date, the rivalry has been played annually, with the lone exception being 1980. Loyola took seven of the first ten meetings, but the Tigers would dominate the 1970s, taking 11 straight matchups. This included a 20-goal thumping of the Hounds in 1974, the widest margin in the history of the rivalry. In '74, Towson would prevail in the 1974 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship to claim its first national title, defeating the Hobart Statesmen 18–17 in double overtime. The Tigers would continue to make the tournament on a regular basis on legendary coach Carl Runk, while Loyola struggled to compete with Towson. In 1980, the Tigers would move up to Division I, accounting for the only interruption in the series to date. The following season, Loyola would down Towson 13–9 to end the losing streak and would finish the season as the national runner-up in Division II.\nNational Implications (1980s through 2000s).\nThe very next year, Loyola moved up to Division I in 1982, joining the Tigers. The first contest at this level went the way of Towson and the following games would gain increasing significance. 1983 was the first between two ranked programs and would go the way of the Tigers. Both teams would make their first appearances in the Division I tournament towards the end of the decade. The 1989 affair was particularly notable as the first between two Top 10 teams, as #3 Loyola topped #8 Towson by five. The next five meetings would also be between Top 10 teams, highlighted by Towson's upset of #1 Loyola in 1992, a home overtime victory. On the national stage, the two teams enjoyed renewed success. Dave Cottle's 1990 Greyhounds finished as national runner-up and the following season would result in Runk's squad losing to North Carolina in the championship. A few years later, Towson would upset Loyola 16–11 in the 1996 tournament in their first postseason meeting.\nAfter long stretches of continued success, both programs struggled at points just before and after the turn of the century. With Cottle's departure before the 2002 season, the Hounds missed their first tournament in fifteen years. The Tigers would endure a four-year tournament drought of their own between 1996 and 2001 before new coach Tony Seamen would lead Towson to another Final Four. In 2006, new head coach Charley Toomey took over for Loyola and would return to the tournament the following year, but neither team was viewed as a serious contender at the national stage.\nRecent Years (2010s to Present).\nThe rivalry's importance was renewed in the 2010s, particularly after the Hound's magical season in 2012, in which they defeated Towson 13–6 and won their first-ever national championship. New Tigers coach Shawn Nadelen quickly built a worthy competitor to Loyola, though the Greyhounds would get the best of their rival in the 2016 tournament to reach another Final Four. Towson would reach the semifinals the next year and, in 2019, would knock off another top-ranked Loyola, sending the Tigers to their first appearance at the top of the national polls in program history. Since 2008, Loyola has won 14 of 16 meetings, coinciding with their high-level success at the top of the collegiate sport. The rivalry records of the current head coaches, Toomey and Nadelen, stand at 12–4 and 2–8 respectively. This includes a dominant performance by the Hounds over winless Towson in 2020, with the nine goal margin representing the largest in the series in six years.\nRival Accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "title": "Singapore Badminton Association",
        "text": "Singapore Badminton Association (abbreviation: SBA) is the national governing body for badminton in Singapore. It governs, encourages and develops the sport throughout the country.\nFounded in 1929, the SBA is an affiliate of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC). It is also a member of the Badminton World Federation (BWF) and Badminton Asia, which was formerly known as the Badminton Asian Confederation.\nAs of 2022, the SBA has a total of 33 member clubs across the country. It closely liaises with the member clubs to provide support to the club and league structures.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nAfter its introduction by the British and the Amateur Sporting Association in the 1920s, badminton gained widespread popularity throughout Singapore. It was against this backdrop that the SBA was established several years later in 1929, with Tan Boo Teck as its inaugural president. Upon its formation, the SBA allowed badminton parties, which were essentially teams consisting of badminton enthusiasts, to affiliate themselves with them and take part in their annual open championships.\nFollowing the Japanese Occupation, the SBA had to deal with the loss of some of its best players to the war, the lack of proper facilities and the rising cost of maintaining the club. Nevertheless, Malaya, which Singapore was then a part of, prepared to send its first team to the 1949 Thomas Cup. The team eventually emerged victorious, beating Denmark 8–1 in the finals held in England.\nAt the time, the lack of proper facilities meant that the SBA's players started practicing in open-air courts. SBA meetings were also mainly held at the Clerical Union Hall. The Thomas Cup win, however, kicked off a fundraiser to build a badminton hall. Despite the donations, the SBA struggled with the cost of the construction and had to relinquish ownership of the badminton hall to the Singapore Sports Council (now known as Sport Singapore). Eventually, the Singapore Badminton Hall, which also doubled as the SBA's headquarters, was opened in 1952.\nIn January 2008, the SBA's lease at the Singapore Badminton Hall expired. The SBA then relocated to the Singapore Sports School. The SBA is currently located at the Singapore Sports Hub, after the latter's construction was completion in 2014.\nPost-independence success.\nBadminton would experience a revival in Singapore after the 1983 Southeast Asian Games, when Wong Shoon Keat won the gold medal at the men's singles.\nIn 2021, Loh Kean Yew made history by becoming the men's singles world champion, winning the title at the 2021 BWF World Championships, becoming the first Singaporean to achieve this feat.\nSBA Badminton Academy.\nIn 2017, the SBA launched the Singapore Badminton Academy in partnership with ActiveSG. The academy, headed by former Olympian Jiang Yanmei, offers a series of badminton programmes across Singapore for aspiring shuttlers aged six to 17. Many former national shuttlers are part of the academy's coaching team.\nTournaments.\nThe SBA is involved in a number of tournaments throughout the year.\nSingapore Open.\nThe Singapore Open is a BWF-sanctioned tournament organised by the SBA. It has been categorised as a BWF World Tour Super 750 event since the BWF announced its new events structure in 2023. The tournament, which offered a total prize money of US$850,000 in its 2023 edition, attracts some of the world's best shuttlers.\nSingapore International.\nThe Singapore International or Singapore Satellite, Cheers Asian Satellite is an open international badminton tournament in Singapore. In the last few years, this tournament has been categorised by BWF as an International Series event.\nSingapore National Championships.\nThe National Open Championships is a Tier 1 SBA Tournament, with the highest ranking points under the National Ranking System.\nOther SBA Sanctioned Tournaments.\nThe following tournaments, all of which are tier 2 and below events, are currently sanctioned by the SBA:\nNotable Shuttlers.\nMany shuttlers have represented Singapore on the world stage, both prior and after the nation gained independence.\nOlympians.\nBelow is the list of Olympians that had represented Singapore over the years:"

At that time, the SEC did not hold a postseason tournament, so the only conference title went to the regular season champion.\nHaving long followed an unwritten rule that teams from Mississippi would never play integrated teams with black players, the Bulldogs had declined all NCAA Tournament invitations prior to 1963. In 1963, however, university president Dean W. Colvard decided to take a risk and accept the tournament invitation. On March 2, 1963, Colvard issued a statement announcing that he would be sending the team to the tournament \"unless hindered by competent authority.\" The decision faced challenges from the state college board and segregationists throughout the South, but ultimately the Mississippi State team was able to depart the state to play in Michigan. In what is now called the \"Game of Change\", the Bulldogs faced a majority-black Loyola-Chicago team in the Mideast regional semifinal. They lost 61–51, but won a consolation game against Bowling Green the following day to finish in 3rd place for the Mideast region."

He played college football at Pittsburgh and was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the seventh round of the 2020 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nJackson played high school football at Quaker Valley High School because the high school he attended, Cornell High School, did not have a football team. Jackson was an all-state basketball player for Cornell. He committed to Pittsburgh on June 24, 2014, choosing the Panthers over Bowling Green and Duquesne. He committed the day after then-Pitt coach Paul Chryst offered Jackson a scholarship after seeing him at a Pitt prospect camp.\nCollege career.\nAfter playing quarterback in high school, Jackson transitioned to cornerback at Pitt. He redshirted his freshman year and played mostly in a reserve role his redshirt freshman year, but then started every game during his sophomore, junior and senior seasons with Pitt. As a senior, he led Pitt with 12 pass breakups, and had 43 tackles, three for a loss, an interception and a sack assist. After his senior season, Jackson was named second-team all-Atlantic Coast Conference and took part in the 2020 Senior Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nBuffalo Bills.\nThe Buffalo Bills selected Jackson in the seventh round with the 239th overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. Jackson signed a four-year, $3.376 million contract with the Bills on May 7, 2020. He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the team on July 30, but was activated a week later. He was waived on September 5, 2020, and signed to the practice squad the next day.\nFollowing injuries to cornerbacks Levi Wallace and Josh Norman, Jackson was elevated to the active roster on October 13, 2020, and reverted to the practice squad after the game. He was elevated to the active roster on October 24 for the team's week 7 game against the New York Jets, and reverted to the practice squad after the game. Against the Jets, he finished with three tackles, two passes defensed, and one interception as the Bills won 18–10. He was elevated again on October 31, November 7, November 14, and January 2, 2021, for the team's weeks 8, 9, 10, and 17 games against the New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks, Arizona Cardinals, and Miami Dolphins, and reverted to the practice squad after each game. He was elevated again on January 15 and 23 for the divisional playoff game and AFC Championship Game against the Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs, and reverted to the practice squad again following each game. On January 26, 2021, Jackson signed a reserves/futures contract with the Bills.\nJackson suffered a neck injury during a Monday Night Football game versus the Tennessee Titans on September 19, 2022, after colliding with teammate Tremaine Edmunds as the two attempted to tackle an opposing player. He was removed from the field in an ambulance, but was released from the hospital the following day after it was determined he had avoided major damage to the neck and spinal cord.\nOn March 17, 2023, Jackson re-signed with the Bills on a one-year contract.\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn March 13, 2024, Jackson signed with the Carolina Panthers."

        "text": "The Trinity Western Spartans men's volleyball team is a university varsity volleyball program in Canada that represents Trinity Western University, competing in the Canada West Universities Athletics Association of U Sports. Based out of Langley, British Columbia, the Spartans play their home games at the Langley Events Centre, a multi-sport facility close to the main campus. Led by then head coach Ron Pike, the Spartans won their first ever National Championship in 2006, defeating the University of Alberta Golden Bears in the final by a score of 3–0. Since then, the Spartans have won six more championships, for a total of seven, hoisting the Tantramar Trophy again in 2011, 2012, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2023. The Spartans were led by head coach Ben Josephson from 2007 to 2022 before he took over as the head coach for Canada's men's volleyball program. Adam Schriemer is now the head coach. In the Canada West conference, the Spartans have won the league title seven times, taking the conference championship in 2007, 2012, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2022.\nHistory.\nRon Pike era.\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Ron Pike led the Spartans men's volleyball team into a new era of competition, as Trinity Western University joined the Canada West conference in 1999. Pike led the program to their first ever post-season berth in 2002, and the program's first ever post-season series win in 2004. That same year, 2003–04, the Spartans earned their first ever national championship berth and went on to win the bronze medal at the national tournament. The following season, Pike led the Spartans to their first national championship final, eventually losing to the Alberta Golden Bears. The following season, 2005–06, the Spartans won the men's volleyball program's first ever National Championship, beating Alberta in straight sets.\nDuring his eight seasons of coaching in Canada West, Pike amassed a total record of 102–92, winning four Canada West medals and three national championship medals.\nOn two occasions, athletes under Ron Pike were nominated for the BLG Award (now known as the Lieutenant Governor Athletic Award) as the top male athlete across all Canadian university sports. Chris Meehan was nominated in 2005-2006 and Josh Howatson was nominated in 2006–07. Howatson would go on to win the BLG award, the school's first ever recipient of this honour. That season, Howatson also captured the program's first ever National Player of the Year award.\nBen Josephson era.\nJosephson was the Spartans head coach from 2007 to 2022, after being an assistant coach from 2004 to 2007. Building upon the championship foundation laid by Ron Pike, Josephson took the program to new heights as he guided TWU to five national championships, winning in 2011, 2012, 2016, 2017 and 2019. Josephson has also led the Spartans to six Canada West championships, winning in 2012, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2022, which includes TWU's current run of 10 straight appearances in the conference final.\nDuring Josephson's tenure, the program produced six U Sports Player of the Year award winners, including Ben Ball (2011–12), Nick Del Bianco (2014–15), Ryan Sclater (2016–17), Adam Schriemer (2016–17), Eric Loeppky (2019–20) and Derek Epp (2021-22). The Spartans have also had two winners of the U Sports Rookie of the Year award, with Adam Schriemer winning in 2013–14 and Eric Loeppky winning in 2016–17. With Josephson at the helm, the Spartans had three players nominated for the BLG Award, with Ben Ball nominated in 2011–2012, Ryan Sclater nominated in 2016–17 and Derek Epp nominated in 2021-22. The program has also produced six Olympians, as men's volleyball alumni Rudy Verhoeff, Steve Marshall, Daniel Jansen Van Doorn, Lucas Van Berkel and Ryan Sclater have represented Canada's national indoor volleyball team, and Chaim Schalk has represented Canada's beach volleyball team.\nOver his career with TWU, Josephson was named both the Canada West Coach of the Year and U Sports Coach of the Year four times, in 2011–12, 2013–14, 2019–2020 and 2021-22. Before moving to the sidelines, Josephson was a stand-out player for the Spartans from 1998 to 2003 and, in his final year, earned the school's first ever All-Canadian award while, in that same year, also being named a Canada West First Team All-Star. \nInternational competition.\nThe Spartans have competed several times against international competition, including representing Canada five times - at the FIVB Club World Championships in 2011, the 2012 Men's U23 Pan-American Volleyball Cup, the 2018 FISU America Games, the 2019 CAN-AM Holiday Showcase, and the 2021 Pan American Cup.\n2011 FIVB Club World Championship.\nThe Spartans travelled to Doha, Qatar in 2011 after being invited to take part in the FIVB Men's Club World Championships. The Spartans were the North American representatives for the 2011 edition of the tournament. The annual tournament features many of the top professional club teams in the world. The Spartans finished that tournament with a 1–2 record, with a win over Iranian champion Paykan Tehran and losses to Russia's Zenit Kazan and Poland's KS Jastrzebski Wegiel.\n2012 Men's U23 Pan-American Volleyball Cup.\nIn 2012, the Spartans were awarded the chance to represent Canada for the U23 Pan American Men's Volleyball Cup. The matches were played at the Langley Events Centre, home of the Spartans. In round robin play, the Spartans finished with two wins and two losses. They finished fourth overall at the tournament, earning wins over the Dominican Republic and Mexico in round robin play before losing to Brazil in the semifinal, and the Dominican Republic in the bronze medal match.\n2018 FISU America Games.\nThe Spartans represented Canada again in 2018 at the inaugural FISU America Games in São Paulo, Brazil. The FISU America Games is a Pan American branch of the FISU World University Games. At the tournament, the Spartans finished with a 1–1 record in pool play. They lost 3–0 to Brazil in the semifinals but went on to beat Mexico 3–2 in the bronze medal match.\n2019 CAN-AM Holiday Showcase.\nIn 2019, the Spartans competed in the inaugural CAN-AM Holiday Showcase. The CAN-AM Volleyball Holiday Showcase featured four Canadian teams, with the University of Alberta, McMaster University and Ryerson University joining TWU against then two-time defending NCAA champions Long Beach State University, as well as UCLA, Lewis University and Ohio State University. TWU went a perfect 3-0 during the course of the tournament, beating Long Beach State, UCLA, and Lewis. The tournament was the first time since 2010 that the Spartans had played NCAA competition.\n2021 Pan American Cup.\nThe Spartans represented Canada at the 2021 Pan American Cup in the Dominican Republic, winning a silver medal. The Spartans finished with a 5-2 overall record, earning wins over Mexico, Dominican Republic (2), Puerto Rico and Suriname. TWU beat the Dominican Republic 3-0 in the semifinals before falling to Mexico in three sets in the gold medal match.\nVenues and facilities.\nFrom 1999 to 2009 the Spartans competed at the David E. Enarson Gymnasium on the Trinity Westerns University campus. During the 2010 season, the Spartans and the Spartan Faithful transitioned to the Langley Events Centre (LEC), a multi-purpose facility in the Township of Langley, which is also the home of TWU's basketball, hockey, and rugby teams. Because of the Spartans success and passionate fan base, the LEC has become one of the hardest gyms in the conference for opposing teams to play in. The Spartans men's volleyball program has hosted the National Championship tournament once, in 2011, which was hosted at the Langley Events Centre. That year, the Spartans captured the program's second national championship.\nNational Player of the Year.\nMembers of the TWU men's volleyball program have been awarded the National Player of the Year Award on seven different occasions.\nOther major award winners.\n\"* denotes award no longer given\"\nLieutenant Governor Athletic Awards.\nAthletes from the men's volleyball program have been nominated on four separate occasions for the Lieutenant Governor Athletic Award (formerly known as the BLG Award), which is given annually to top male and female athletes across all Canadian universities. Chris Meehan was nominated in 2005–2006, Josh Howatson was nominated in 2006–07, Ben Ball was nominated in 2011–2012, Ryan Sclater was nominated in 2016–17 and Derek Epp was nominated in 2021-22. Howatson went on to win the award as the top Male Athlete in Canada in 2006–07.\nCanada West regular season records.\n\"*- denotes divisional finish\"\nPostseason history.\nCanada West playoffs results.\nSince beginning Canada West competition in the 1999–2000 season, the program has medalled 15 times, including every year from 2010 to 2020, as well as reaching the conference championship match from 2012 to 2020. To date, the program has captured a total of six conference championships which includes: 2007, 2012, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2020.\nU Sports Championship Tournament results.\nThe men's volleyball program reached the national championship tournament for the first time in program history in 2004 where they earned the bronze medal. In total, the program has won 12 national tournament medals, which included a run of five straight years in which the Spartans won either a gold or silver medal (2015-2019). The program has captured the National Championship six times, including in 2006, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2017 and 2019. Heading into the 2020 National Championship, the Spartans earned the number one seed having captured the Canada West Championship and a league-best record of 20–2, but were unable to compete for their fourth championship in five years when the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nRecord vs. Canada West opponents.\nAll-time series record includes conference matches and postseason results from 1999 to 2020.\nSpartans representing Team Canada.\nTWU has seen may athletes go on to compete for the senior national team, both in beach volleyball and indoor volleyball at several levels including the Canadian youth national team, junior national team, FISU Summer Games Team, senior national ‘B’ team, senior national team, and Canadian beach national team.

It allows us, with the debt where it is, to start thinking about how we drive forward and sustain the domestic game in Scotland.\"\nDuring Flockhart's time as president the SRU received criticism for the way it handled the sacking of their Director of Rugby, Keith Russell - the father of Scotland international Finn Russell - and the introduction of 'Agenda 3' which created an Edinburgh-centric national professional league competition, the Super 6, with 3 of the 6 sides coming from the capital - and no sides from the cities of Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee or Inverness.\nIn his annual report address to the SRU delegates, Flockhart stated: \"Over the last six weeks or so there's been a cloud over Scottish Rugby, I believe caused by two things: Firstly, the findings of the employment tribunal in relation to our former director of domestic rugby Keith Russell – I want to reassure you that through Council and board we will learn the lessons from the tribunal findings, we will implement recommendations from the review undertaken by Lesley Thomson, Scotland's former solicitor general. And I want to take this opportunity today to apologise to you all for the manner in which these matters have transpired. We must do better in this regard. Secondly, the concern and uncertainty surrounding Agenda 3. Agenda 3 was only ever a response to a recognition by many of our clubs and those volunteers in them that change is needed if our game is to survive and flourish. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to resolve these reservations, those concerns and those uncertainties and I hope that today we can go some way towards that.\"\nHe was bullish about the finances of the SRU. \"It's hugely pleasing. It helps drive Agenda 3, but the whole change in the past decade has been absolutely remarkable. The idea that we were so strung up with debt that it was difficult to do any forward planning until the debt was reduced means that the financial results allows us to show that we can handle debt and focus on future projects. There have been eight consecutive sell-outs at BT Murrayfield. 67,000 at the Samoa game. The performances of the Men's and Women's national teams, as well as Glasgow and Edinburgh, have all contributed to these recent figures; you don't get to turn over £57 million unless there are big crowds at the very biggest games and successful teams are at the root of that. The turnover means that we can fund better professional teams but more importantly, we can fund club investment and the intention is to put more and more into the domestic game. The three strands of Agenda 3 – the Finance, Performance and Participation – money is needed for all of these. When I was elected I promised that I would try and brings clubs to the forefront of everything that happened at BT Murrayfield, which I think there's no denying has been the focus. Clubs wanted change and that's what Agenda 3 has tried to produce. There will be more discussion of course, and that's absolutely welcome; the finance allows other things to happen.\""

        "title": "Super Bowl XXXVI halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl XXXVI Halftime Show, known through corporate sponsorship as the E-Trade Super Bowl XXXVI Halftime Show, was the halftime entertainment of Super Bowl XXXVI, which took place on February 3, 2002, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. It featured Irish rock band U2 as the performer. Using a heart-shaped stage replicated from their 2001 Elevation Tour, the group played three songs and paid tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks, which had occurred in the United States five months earlier. The show was produced by Clear Channel Entertainment, which also produced the band's Elevation Tour. The Super Bowl and its halftime show were televised nationally in the US by Fox.\nSinger Janet Jackson was originally booked as the halftime performer, but after the September 11 attacks, it was decided that a different artist would be needed to set the tone required. U2 were selected as the replacement after several executives from the National Football League (NFL) attended one of their October 2001 concerts in New York City and were emotionally impacted by the band's tribute to the attack victims, whose names were projected across the ceiling of Madison Square Garden. During their halftime performance, the band played their 2000 hit single \"Beautiful Day\", the 1984 song \"MLK\", and their 1987 hit single \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". During the latter two songs, U2's tribute to the September 11 victims was reprised, as their names were projected onto a vertical scrim behind the stage and across the interior of the Superdome. At the end of the performance, lead singer Bono opened his jacket to reveal an American flag in the lining.\nThe halftime show drew a 38.3 Nielsen rating and was watched by 82.9 million viewers in 40.2 million households in the US. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the band's performance and the poignancy of the 9/11 tribute. In the week following U2's performance, sales of their 2000 album \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" increased in the US by 142 percent. In 2006, U2 returned to the Superdome as the entertainment for another NFL game, performing with Green Day for the New Orleans Saints' first home game since Hurricane Katrina. Many critics have ranked U2's performance at Super Bowl XXXVI among the top Super Bowl halftime shows.\nBackground.\nU2's 2000 studio album \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" was commercially and critically successful. It debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 10 million copies by December 2001. The record's lead single, \"Beautiful Day\", was a worldwide hit, and in February 2001 it won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. The band embarked on a concert tour, the Elevation Tour, in March 2001. The first two legs sold out all 83 concerts across North America and Europe and grossed US$105 million.\nOn September 10, 2001, Clear Channel Entertainment (CCE) and SFX Entertainment announced a third leg of U2's Elevation Tour, consisting of a return trip to North America. Tickets for the shows were scheduled to go on sale on September 15, but the day after the announcement, the September 11 attacks occurred in the United States; four passenger airliners were hijacked by al-Qaeda terrorists and crashed in New York City and near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people. CCE and SFX postponed ticket sales out of respect for the tragedy. Many artists cancelled tours of North America altogether in the wake of the attacks, but on September 17, CCE and SFX announced that the Elevation Tour would continue as planned and that tickets would go on sale for various shows starting September 21.\nFollowing the attacks, \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" found added resonance with American audiences, as the album climbed on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart and songs such as \"Walk On\" and \"Peace on Earth\" garnered radio airplay. Both tracks were performed during U2's appearance on the \"\" telethon to benefit the attack victims. The Elevation Tour was the top-earning North American tour of 2001 with a gross of US$109.7 million, the second-highest ever at the time for a North American tour. Globally, it grossed US$143.5 million from 2.18 million tickets sold, making it the year's highest-grossing tour overall. U2 was named \"Band of the Year\" by the magazines \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Spin\".\nAs a result of the September 11 attacks, the National Football League (NFL) postponed its games scheduled for that week until the end of the 2001 regular season. To allow the playoffs to be held in their entirety, in October the NFL rescheduled Super Bowl XXXVI at the Louisiana Superdome from January 27, 2002, to February 3.\nBooking.\nJim Steeg, the executive of special events for the NFL, completed booking the original entertainment lineup for Super Bowl XXXVI by August 2001. The billing would have featured performers from a diverse range of musical genres: Lionel Richie for \"America the Beautiful\", the Bee Gees and Creedence Clearwater Revival for a pregame performance, and Janet Jackson for the halftime show. However, after the September 11 attacks, Jackson cancelled the European leg of her All for You Tour and was not travelling, and she decided to pull out of the Super Bowl after realising her show would not fit the mood that was required.\nNFL marketing executive John Collins was tasked with finding a replacement for the halftime show. On October 25, 2001, he attended a U2 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. During the band's performance of \"One\", a scrolling list of the names of the 9/11 victims appeared on screen. Collins witnessed fans becoming emotional at that moment, and realised U2 would make an ideal replacement for the halftime show. In a meeting the following day, Collins and two other league officials who had attended the concert discussed its poignancy and unanimously agreed with the idea of booking U2. NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said, \"we certainly like the music, but we like the message that U2 carries, which is responsibility to others and a sense of freedom\". Collins called Jimmy Iovine, chairman of Interscope Records and producer of U2's 1988 album \"Rattle and Hum\", and pitched him on U2 recreating the same tribute at the Super Bowl. Iovine contacted lead singer Bono and conveyed the NFL's proposal to him.\nThe following day, Bono met with several executives of the NFL, including Collins, Steeg, commissioner Paul Tagliabue, COO Roger Goodell, and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Bono was enthusiastic about the prospect of being involved in a Super Bowl halftime show and proposed an extravagant show that would incorporate elements of world music. Many were skeptical of the idea, and the NFL debated for several days whether to book U2. Some argued against an Irish act paying tribute to the victims of an American tragedy, while a television executive mentioned that a past U2 television special had drawn low ratings. Goodell was immediately on board with the idea of U2, and while Tagliabue was initially uncertain, he ultimately came around and decided to book them. Greg Hagglund, vice president and executive producer of CCE, met with U2 in Las Vegas during a stop on their Elevation Tour to have a brainstorming session about the show. He said that Bono \"had such a grasp of what he wanted and what we and the NFL felt was appropriate\".\nOn November 27, 2001, it was reported that E-Trade had reached an agreement with the NFL to sponsor the halftime show for the third consecutive year. The deal was reportedly worth more than US$3 million. On November 30, the NFL announced that CCE had been selected to produce the halftime show, and on December 2, the league announced that U2 would perform. Super Bowl XXXVI marked the first time that CCE was involved in a Super Bowl halftime show; most of the previous halftime shows had been produced by the television networks, with the exception of Super Bowl XXXV's show in 2001 that was produced by MTV. U2 were the first international act to be the sole performer for a Super Bowl halftime show. McCarthy said: \"we were looking for a band that would help capture and lift the spirit of America and the world. With U2 we found what we were looking for.\" Regarding the show's content, he added: \"This year, we're looking to make it more relevant and meaningful, rather than dropping a rock concert in the middle of a football game. We're looking to provide entertainment that's memorable and inspiring.\" U2's booking was in line with the NFL recasting the Super Bowl entertainment under the theme \"Heroes, Hope, and Homeland\". McCarthy said, \"With the events of September 11th, we've redefined and refocused the game presentation, and the theme is celebration and the human spirit and the values of freedom, and also to everyday heroes\".\nU2 and other musical acts at the Super Bowl were unpaid for their performances, as the NFL covered only travel expenses and accommodations in New Orleans. An NFL insider said, \"We would have paid U2, but they didn't want any money.\"\nPromotion.\nAn NFL representative said one factor in the league's decision to select CCE to produce the halftime show was its ability to use its vast media holdings, which included 1,200 radio stations, to promote the event. To increase interest in the Super Bowl in the weeks preceding it, NFL Films re-shot the music videos for U2's songs \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" and \"Beautiful Day\" to include football footage. The NFL and Fox both used the band's songs in television commercials advertising the 2001–02 NFL playoffs. Collins said that the league's and Interscope Records' objective was \"to help make U2 synonymous with the NFL\".\nAmerica Online held a sweepstake contest to award a Super Bowl XXXVI trip package to one of its members and a guest. The package included access to the inside of U2's heart-shaped stage during their halftime performance.\nIn a counterprogramming move against the halftime show, on December 17, 2001, NBC announced it would air an episode of \"Fear Factor\" featuring \"Playboy\" Playmates at the same time that Fox would broadcast the halftime show.\nPreparations and rehearsals.\nA few weeks before the game, a major production issue arose when organizers discovered they were unable to power the projectors that would scroll the victims' names across the domed ceiling of the Superdome. Collins was irate and demanded organizers resolve the problem, stating, \"The only reason Paul Tagliabue approved this was because of the names going across the roof.\" A generator was ultimately located, allowing the projection to proceed. Around January 21, 2002, production crews arrived at Tad Gormley Stadium at the University of New Orleans to work on the logistical aspects of the halftime show, particularly the process of building and disassembling the stage on the field in the mandated amount of time. After arriving in New Orleans on January 30, the band rehearsed in the Superdome and participated in a 20-minute press conference that day. During rehearsals, it was debated whether to project the victims' names onto a scrim behind the stage or not; the projection was not powerful enough to be seen across the ceiling. Ultimately, the scrim was adopted, but to some, the effect did not look good. After the Friday rehearsal just two days before the Super Bowl, one NFL executive remained cynical about the show's prospects, saying, \"This is going to be the worst halftime show ever.\"\nShow production.\nCCE's Special Events Group in St. Louis was responsible for managing the timing and technical aspects of the show, as well as managing talent. Hagglund produced the performance and coordinated with the special events department. The NFL set financial and creative terms for the halftime show. Hagglund called it \"the biggest special event we've ever done\". CCE employed 45 full-time staff members to work on the halftime show, in addition to contractors, stagehands, and volunteers. The halftime show ran for 23 minutes; setup and disassembly of the stage on the field required five-to-six minutes each, leaving the band between 11–12 minutes to perform. Hagglund called it an \"unbelievable challenge\". Producer Dennis M. Despie oversaw the show from a location 200 feet above the stage. Sergeant Sam Dotson of the Metropolitan Police Department, City of St. Louis coordinated security for the halftime show. Jim McClellan served as a co-executive producer.\nStage design and equipment.\nThe stage, which featured a heart shape with an open center, was replicated from the one designed by Mark Fisher for the band's 2001 Elevation Tour. Between 2,000 and 3,000 winners of a Clear Channel radio promotion were selected to be on field for the performance, 400 of whom occupied the inside of the heart. The stage comprised 22 interlocking pieces varying in weight from ; in total, the stage weighed . The sections of the stage were wheeled onto the field by a team of 250 volunteers, who were split into groups of ten and blended in with the rest of the on-field audience after completing the stage assembly. The wheels of each stage segment had soft tires to avoid damaging the playing surface.\nThe names of the 9/11 victims were projected by twelve 7-kilowatt xenon PIGI film projectors manufactured by E/T/C Audiovisuel and supplied by Fourth Phase Image Systems Group; they were the same type of projectors used during the band's Elevation Tour. The victims' names were projected across the interior of the Superdome, as well as onto a Kabuki scrim measuring high by wide. Willie Williams and Catherine Owens created the projections, while Brian Beasley operated the projectors.\nMuch of the same lighting equipment from the Elevation Tour was used for the halftime show. In partnership with Williams, lighting directors Bob Dicksinon and Ted Wells used two lighting systems with luminaires by Vari-Lite. The one suspended above the stage featured 38 VL2416 fixtures, 24 VL5 fixtures, 210 VL5Arc fixtures, and 18 VL7 fixtures, and it was controlled by Victor Fable with a Virtuoso console. The lighting system at ground level comprised 30 VL2416 fixtures, 12 VL5 fixtures, and 30 VL5Arc fixtures, and was controlled by Willy McLachlan with a Virtuoso console. Bruce Ramus operated the lighting. U2's halftime set required three times more cabling and lighting than the previous three Super Bowls in New Orleans combined.\nATK AudioTek Corp. coordinated the audio aspects of the show. Their JBL VerTec speaker system was suspended above the stage, while their portable V-DOSC cart speaker system was wheeled onto the field at ground level. All-digital mixing consoles were used, including a 48-channel InnovaSon Grand Live console that served as the front-of-house mixing station for all entertainment for the fans in attendance. James Stoffo of Orlando's Professional Wireless supplied the wireless microphone equipment, which consisted of ten Sennheiser SKM 5000 microphone/transmitter sets and two Sennheiser EM 1046 receiver units (each capable of eight channels). Stoffo, who had worked on seven prior Super Bowls, was responsible for managing issues related to RF interference; over 1,500 other frequencies were occupied on gameday, 300 of which were in the same frequency band as the SKM 5000 microphones.\nPerformance synopsis.\nOrganisers said that most of the musical performers at Super Bowl XXXVI would pre-record their performances to reduce the possibility of technical problems. U2, however, said they intended to play live for the halftime show. When asked if he would lip sync, Bono said: \"I'll be singing live. Call us old-fashioned, but I thought it might be novel. It might catch on with the kids.\" A backing rhythm track accompanied the band's live performance as a precaution. Despie said it was required as a \"technical protection\" against \"the risk of a show going down\". An Associated Press report published days before the Super Bowl claimed that the band would perform \"Walk On\". It was confirmed that the band would perform three songs, but they did not announce in advance which ones. The websites for U2 and the NFL stated that they would play at least one track from a list consisting of \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", \"Desire\", \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\", and \"Beautiful Day\".\nThe on-field audience held light sticks. The show began with U2 performing their 2000 hit single \"Beautiful Day\". For the first verse, Bono walked with a cameraman through the on-field crowd to reach the stage. While doing so, fans started slapping Bono on the back. Realising the wires for his in-ear monitors were exposed, he began to panic. He said: \"All one person has to do is pull the wire, and I'm off air. I would hear nothing. Off the air in front of a billion people!\" Bono said that his smirking facial reaction was a reflection of his fear at that moment; he admitted that he was \"swaggering with the most annoying smirk ever seen. You just think: That guy is such a prat!\" The band's second song was the elegiac \"MLK\", during which the scrim was raised behind the stage, onto which a scrolling list of names of the 9/11 victims were projected. This segment segued into the third and final song, the band's 1987 hit single \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". Towards the end of the song, the scrim was released to the ground, and the names continued to scroll and be projected onto the interior of the Superdome. At the conclusion of the song, Bono opened his leather jacket to reveal an American flag in the lining.\nReception.\nU2's halftime show performance received generally positive reviews. Dan Shaughnessy of \"The Boston Globe\" called it: \"the greatest halftime show in the history of sporting events. Hands down.\" John Smyntek of the \"Detroit Free Press\" rated U2's performance \"Four stars all the way\", saying that it \"sure beat other recent Super Bowl halves that tried to telescope the wide world of pop\". Phillip B. Wilson of \"The Indianapolis Star\" gave the halftime show a \"B\" rating and called it a \"touching tribute\" to the victims of September 11. Roger Catlin of the \"Hartford Courant\" said that U2 was a \"perfect fit\" for the occasion, calling them \"a group clearly used to big events, big crowds and big statements\". He praised the decision to perform the uplifting \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" and Bono's revelation of the American flag in his jacket lining, saying it was \"as if to demonstrate beneath his rock star exterior, he's with his U.S. fans on this most American of days\". Tom Shales of \"The Washington Post\" said of the band's tribute to the 9/11 victims, \"To some, it may have seemed rather a garish memorial, but in a strangely affecting way, it worked, and respectfully.\" Tim Goodman of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said: \"The real deal was an inspired bit of rock from U2 as the halftime entertainment. Here's a quick pop quiz: Has the halftime show ever been good? Ever? Pencils down. Correct answer: Not in our lifetime. And yet, U2's live breath of fresh air and dramatic, emotional spectacle that paid homage to the victims of Sept. 11 was both daringly bombastic and also pretty damn cool.\" David Bianculli of the \"New York Daily News\" said that the halftime show \"managed to strike the right mood of patriotism, pride and solemnity.\" He added: \"It was theater, yes – but on a grand scale. Given the occasion, it was grand indeed.\" Peter King of \"CNN/SI\" called the band's performance \"perfect for the occasion\" and said, \"I praise you, NFL, selfishly, for giving me 11 terrific minutes at halftime of a great event\".\nTim Kawakami of the \"San Jose Mercury News\" said: \"Many Roman numerals down the road, I'll still remember those shimmering moments when the banner dropped, U2 played loud, live and intimate, and the names of those lost in the Sept. 11 attacks glowed in the dark, lit by spotlights and projected onto the crowd.\" Ed Bark of \"The Dallas Morning News\" called the performance \"electrifying\" and said about the tribute, \"The roaring crowd reaction dwarfed anything produced by the game itself until the Patriots' thrilling victory on a last-second field goal.\"\nHal Boedeker of \"The Orlando Sentinel\" praised the performance for being \"thrilling\" with \"urgent, powerful renditions\" of the songs and for its tribute to the 9/11 victims. Boedeker said the halftime show \"elevated the patriotic Fox broadcast\" and was \"mercifully simpler than the usually overproduced halftimes\". Kevin C. Johnson of the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" called the show an \"unqualified success\" and U2's performance \"crowd-rousing\". He said, \"when you have U2 as your headliner and only act, you've got a guaranteed winner on your hands\". Despite scepticism about U2's decision to play the Super Bowl halftime show, Chris Willman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said: \"Once U2 took the makeshift stage, all my compunctions vanished. The three-song mini-set was nothing us fans hadn't seen before, but somehow, sharing it with the rest of America... made the moment more galvanizing, familiar or not.\" Eric Deggans of the \"St. Petersburg Times\" said that the \"Fear Factor\" counterprogramming \"couldn't have been any more bloated or exploitative than U2's oddly out-of-place halftime performance\". He said the fault did not lie with U2 themselves but that \"it nevertheless seemed odd: An Irish band singing about transcending society's oppressive values before a list of people killed in America's most devastating attack\". Ed Sherman of the \"Chicago Tribune\" criticised the halftime show for not paying enough reverence to the 9/11 victims when displaying their names, saying: \"Instead U2 played to a screaming crowd that was bouncing up and down, completely oblivious to the banner memorializing the dead. That should have been a solemn moment, not the background for a rock show.\"\nCommercial impact.\nThe Super Bowl was expected to draw 130 million viewers in the United States and 800 million worldwide. According to Nielsen ratings, U2's halftime show drew a 38.3 rating, equating to 40.2 million households and 82.9 million viewers in the United States. The performance lost only 4.4 percent of viewers from the previous half hour of the football game. NBC's counterprogramming, a \"Fear Factor\" episode featuring \"Playboy\" Playmates, drew only a 5.6 rating, equating to 5.9 million households. In the week following U2's Super Bowl performance, \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" sold 46,000 copies (a 142-percent increase) in the United States, causing it to jump on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart from number 66 to 25. Additionally, sales doubled for three of the group's older albums, resulting in jumps on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart: \"The Best of 1980–1990\" reached number 2 after selling 14,000 units (a 154-percent increase); \"The Joshua Tree\" reached number 14 after selling 7,000 units (a 144-percent increase); and \"The Best of 1990–2000/The B-Sides\" reached number 35.\nUSA Home Entertainment secured the rights to the video footage of U2's halftime performance, and included it as a bonus feature in DVD copies of the official Patriots Super Bowl championship video; it was the first Super Bowl championship video to feature a halftime show.\nLegacy.\nU2's performance is considered by critics to be one of the best Super Bowl halftime shows. In 2019, \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it \"probably the most moving Super Bowl halftime performance to date\". BBC Music and \"Variety\" ranked it seventh-best, while \"CBSSports.com\" ranked it sixth-best as of 2018. In 2024, Levi Weaver of \"The Athletic\" ranked U2's performance the third-best Super Bowl halftime, saying that the group \"managed to pull off the impossible — performing a touching tribute to a moment at the time still too big and too new to fully process, but doing so without sacrificing an ounce of showmanship or delving into jingoism\". Jim Harrington of \"The Mercury News\" ranked it the second-best of the 21st century, while \"Billboard\" and Roisin O'Connor of \"The Independent\" ranked it second-best overall. In 2021, \"Thrillist\" ranked it the second-best halftime show, saying, \"U2 delivered the kind of bald sentimentality that both attracts and repels legions of fans and detractors, though it's tough not to appreciate the raw power of the performance\" during the tribute to the September 11 victims. In 2014, Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" placed it first on his list, saying, \"U2 created one of the truly great live-TV rock &amp; roll moments of all time, up there with 'Bad' at Live Aid\". He added: \"Only U2 could have made this so grandiose, yet so emotionally direct. Grown men wept buckets. Every daft ambition U2 ever had, every lofty claim they ever made, they earned [that night].\" Sheffield later re-ranked the performance to second-best in 2023. \nLisa Redmond of \"NBC Sports\" ranked it number one, saying, \"While other halftime shows may have been more entertaining, none of them have had as much meaning as this one.\" Brian Mansfield of \"USA Today\" ranked it first, saying that U2 \"gave a sentimental, cathartic performance that went from celebration to elegy and back... By embracing the nation's still-fresh pain, the band transcended the game, making the performance the only one that stands on its own as a cultural event.\" Sean Merriman of \"Bleacher Report\" ranked it first, calling it \"one of the most moving musical tributes of all time\". Other publications such as the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\", \"Sports Illustrated\", and the NFL's own website also described or ranked it as the best Super Bowl halftime show. Writing for \"Uproxx\", critic Steven Hyden ranked U2's Super Bowl concert 17th on a list of the best televised musical performances since 2000; he called it \"one of the few times when the Super Bowl halftime show actually felt important as a virtual town square where people go to feel less alone\".\nOn the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, U2's halftime performance was re-aired on the \"NFL Total Access\" program on NFL Network.\nOn September 25, 2006, U2 once again performed at the Superdome in New Orleans as part of entertainment for an NFL football game. For the New Orleans Saints' first home game back at the Superdome since Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, U2 and Green Day performed four songs during a pre-game show: Green Day's song \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\", \"The House of the Rising Sun\", a cover of the Skids' track \"The Saints Are Coming\", and U2's \"Beautiful Day\".\nReferences.\nFootnotes\nBibliography"

        "text": "Robert Anthony Miller (born April 5, 1999) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played college baseball for the Louisville Cardinals and was selected 29th overall by the Dodgers in the 2020 MLB draft.\nAmateur career.\nMiller attended McHenry West High School in McHenry, Illinois, where he played baseball. In 2016, his junior season, he had a 5–2 win–loss record with a 1.98 earned run average (ERA) and 76 strikeouts over 55 innings pitched. After his senior year in 2017, the Baltimore Orioles selected him in the 38th round of the 2017 Major League Baseball draft, but he did not sign a professional contract.\nMiller enrolled at the University of Louisville where he played college baseball for the Louisville Cardinals. As a freshman in 2018, Miller went 6–1 with a 2.97 ERA over 17 games (nine starts), earning Freshman All-American honors and spots on the American Athletic Conference Third Team and All-Freshman Team. After the 2018 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 2019, his sophomore year at Louisville, he pitched to a 7–1 record with a 3.83 ERA over twenty games (12 starts) and eighty innings. That summer, he spent time playing for the USA Baseball Collegiate National Team. As a junior in 2020, he went 2–0 with a 2.31 ERA over four starts, striking out 34 over innings before the college baseball season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nProfessional career.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers selected Miller in the first round, with the 29th overall pick, in the 2020 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Dodgers for a $2.2 million signing bonus. He did not play a minor league game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season caused by the pandemic.\nMiller made his professional debut as the starting pitcher on Opening Day in 2021 for the Great Lakes Loons of the High-A Central, striking out five batters over three innings while allowing only two singles and a walk. On July 24, Miller pitched five innings of a combined no-hitter against the Lake County Captains alongside Clayton Beeter, Jake Cantleberry, and Cameron Gibbens. Miller appeared in 14 games (11 starts) for the Loons, compiling a 2–2 record and 3.06 ERA while striking out 56 over 46 innings. On September 8, he was promoted to the Tulsa Drillers of the Double-A Central, and pitched innings for them to end the season. He was selected to play in the Arizona Fall League for the Glendale Desert Dogs after the season where he was named to the Fall Stars Game. He returned to Tulsa to begin the 2022 season, where he made 19 starts and went 6–6 with a 4.45 ERA and 117 strikeouts over 91 innings and was selected to represent the Dodgers at the 2022 All-Star Futures Game. Miller was promoted to the Oklahoma City Dodgers of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League on August 15. He made four starts for Oklahoma City, with a 1–1 record and 3.38 ERA.\nMiller reported to spring training with a sore shoulder in 2023, leading to him missing the Cactus League schedule and getting a late start on the season, not joining Oklahoma City until the end of April. After his fourth AAA start of the season, Miller had his contract purchased by Los Angeles and was called up to the majors to start against the Atlanta Braves on May 23. In his debut, he picked up the win while allowing one run on four hits and one walk with five strikeouts. His first MLB strikeout was against Sam Hilliard. He remained in the starting rotation the rest of the season, making 22 starts, with a 11–4 record, 3.76 ERA and 119 strikeouts. Miller started the second game of the 2023 National League Division Series but struggled with his command, allowing three runs on four hits and two walks in only innings."

        "title": "2022 British Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2022 British Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Lenovo British Grand Prix 2022) was a Formula One motor race held on 3 July 2022 at the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire, England.\nCarlos Sainz Jr. took both his first pole position and Formula One victory, ahead of Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton. Sainz became the first Spanish driver to win a race since Fernando Alonso won the 2013 Spanish Grand Prix. Championship leader Max Verstappen finished seventh after acquiring car damage early in the race. A multi-car crash occurred on the opening lap, in which Zhou Guanyu's car flipped over the tyre wall marking the circuit boundaries.\nBackground.\nThe event was held across the weekend of the 1–3 July. It was the tenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship. It was the 73rd time the British Grand Prix has been held and the race took place two weeks after the Canadian Grand Prix and preceded the Austrian Grand Prix.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nFollowing the Canadian Grand Prix, Max Verstappen led the Drivers' Championship by 46 points from teammate Sergio Pérez, with Charles Leclerc third, a further three points behind. Red Bull Racing led the Constructors' Championship, leading Ferrari by 74 points. Mercedes were in third place, trailing Ferrari by 40 points.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race. It was the 150th race start for Carlos Sainz Jr.\nTyre choices.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C1, C2, and C3 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively) for teams to use at the event.\nPractice.\nThe weekend had three practice sessions, each lasting one hour. The first session took place on 1 July and started at 13:00 local time (). There was rain before and during the session, with teams deciding not to go on track as much as they normally would have, due to dry weather predicted for the rest of the weekend. Towards the end of the session the weather cleared and the track began to dry. A number of drivers attempted to drive the track on slick tyres, including Lance Stroll, who spun at turn 9, getting stuck in the gravel. The session was red flagged and not resumed. Valtteri Bottas was fastest, with Lewis Hamilton and Carlos Sainz Jr. in second and third respectively.\nThe second session took place on 1 July and started at 16:00 local time. The session was conducted in dry conditions. No major incidents meant the whole session was under green flag conditions. The Aston Martin of Sebastian Vettel picked up some floor damage in the session, but he made it back to the pits. Sainz was fastest, with Hamilton and Lando Norris in second and third respectively.\nThe third practice session started at 12:00 local time on 2 July. There were no major incidents and so the whole session was under green flag conditions. Max Verstappen was fastest, with Sergio Pérez and Charles Leclerc in second and third respectively.\nQualifying.\nQualifying started at 15:00 local time on 2 July, and lasted for one hour. The session was held in wet conditions and ended with Carlos Sainz Jr. claiming his maiden pole position. Max Verstappen's final qualifying attempt was interrupted by yellow flags, after Charles Leclerc spun.\nRace.\nRace report.\nThe race started at 15:00 local time on 3 July. Max Verstappen took the lead at the start from Carlos Sainz Jr., while Lewis Hamilton moved up to third. George Russell had a bad start and was passed by Nicholas Latifi, and Zhou Guanyu pulled alongside him leaving a large gap between them. Gasly attempted to pass between Zhou and Russell, but Russell moved to the left too late to close the gap causing his left rear tyre to make contact with Gasly's right front. Gasly backed out but the impact pointed Russell's car to the left shooting him across the track and directly into the side of Zhou's car. The impact launched Zhou's car into the air. He landed upside down, skidding down the track, then skipping and bouncing across the long gravel trap at the end of the straight, all while barely slowing and turning sideways. The inverted car suddenly dug into the gravel carrying sufficient speed and momentum to launch it over the tire barrier, rotating 540 degrees on its axis before hitting the catch fencing sideways facing up just a few feet from the front row of the grandstand. It then dropped 8 feet and landed wedged into the small gap between the fence and tire barrier, stopping on its side with the cockpit up against the backside of the tire barrier. As a result of the incident, Valtteri Bottas slowed slightly, which caused Alexander Albon to also slow. Sebastian Vettel attempted to brake, but was too close to Albon and hit him. Albon spun into the concrete pit wall, rebounded back on the track and was hit by Yuki Tsunoda and Esteban Ocon, damaging both of their cars. Tsunoda and Ocon both returned to the pit lane for repairs, but Albon was unable to continue. Russell, who had spun, stopped to help the marshalls with Zhou's flipped car. When he returned to his car it was not running so he could not continue.\nRace control red-flagged the race due to both crashes. Zhou was extracted from his Alfa Romeo and stretchered to an ambulance where he was taken to the race medical centre. Albon was also taken to the race medical centre but was later transferred by helicopter to Coventry Hospital for observations. Both were later released.\nThe order for the race restart was set to the grid order, as not all the cars had passed the second safety car line before the race was red-flagged, meaning it was not possible to accurately determine the running order at the time of the red flag. The race restarted at 15:56 local time and Sainz retained the lead at the restart, before being passed by Verstappen once DRS was enabled. Verstappen later ran over debris, that resulted in a loss of pace. Verstappen misjudged that the loss of pace was a puncture and came into the pit for new tyres. Red Bull later realised it was floor damage that caused the pace loss.\nThe two AlphaTauri cars collided on lap 14, both continued initially but Gasly later retired due to the collision damage.\nBottas pitted and retired on lap 21 due to a gearbox issue and on lap 39, Ocon suffered a fuel pump problem and stopped on track, causing a safety car. The safety car allowed everyone to pit. Charles Leclerc was one of a few drivers not to pit, being told to stay out by his Ferrari team. Leclerc led the restart but was quickly passed by teammate Sainz. Leclerc subsequently defended from Sergio Pérez, which allowed Hamilton to pass them both on the exit of the last corner. Once Pérez passed Leclerc, he re-overtook Hamilton for second. \nSainz won his first Formula One race, becoming the 112th winner in the history of the championship, the second Spaniard to win a Formula One race after Fernando Alonso, and being the first Spaniard to win a race since the 2013 Spanish Grand Prix, and the first driver who had his maiden win at the British Grand Prix since Johnny Herbert in 1995. Pérez was in second and Hamilton third, also setting the fastest lap. Leclerc managed to stay ahead of Alonso for fourth, as the latter finished fifth, ahead of Lando Norris. Despite a last lap battle, Verstappen held off Mick Schumacher for seventh. Schumacher finished inside the points for the first time in his Formula One career. Sebastian Vettel was ninth and Kevin Magnussen was tenth.\nAttempted race disruption.\nDuring the race suspension, a group of Just Stop Oil supporters walked onto the track and sat down on the tarmac. They were later arrested by police. The protestors' cause was supported by drivers Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton, and Carlos Sainz, though all three drivers said that these people should not have put themselves at risk of physical harm. F1 president Stefano Domenicali also criticized the protesting method. Before the race, Northamptonshire Police warned they had \"creditable intelligence\" that a group of protesters were planning to disrupt the race and potentially attempt a track invasion, and that the protest would be related to environmental issues, but the warning did not mention Just Stop Oil by name.\nPost race.\nAfter the race, Russell stated that lessons needed to be learned from Zhou's crash, after rescue teams struggled to extract him from his car, which was in a narrow gap between the tyre barrier and the catch fencing, stating \"[there was] nothing [Zhou] could have done\". Russell went on to say that \"We need think to avoid a car being stuck in such a fine gap.\" Concern was also raised surrounding the failure of the roll-hoop, designed to stop the driver's head hitting the ground in the event of a car being upside-down. Although Zhou's head was still protected by the halo (which he credited with saving his life), the roll-hoop failure would have trapped Zhou in his car had the car stopped upside-down. The FIA launched an investigation into the crash.\nRace classification.\nNotes"

Antonio Giovinazzi drove for Haas in place of Mick Schumacher, while Nyck de Vries drove for Aston Martin in place of Sebastian Vettel, during the first practice session. De Vries was called up to race for Williams in place of Alexander Albon as he was ruled out with appendicitis before the third practice session. The Grand Prix marked the 349th race start for Fernando Alonso, equalling Kimi Räikkönen's record for most Formula One starts.\nTyre choices.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C2, C3, and C4 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively) for teams to use at the event.\nPenalties.\nAlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda carried a 10-place grid penalty for exceeding his quota of reprimand limits at the previous round, the Dutch Grand Prix.\nTrack changes.\nThe second DRS detection point was moved farther ahead, being positioned after turn 11.\nFan harassment and event mismanagement.\nDuring the weekend there were numerous allegations of management issues and fan harassment. One Twitter user has reported a local fan demanded that fans remove items declaring their support of Max Verstappen. Another video showed several fans making a sexist tone against Sophie Kumpen, Verstappen's mother. Race organisers were criticised for a lack of security in the grandstands.\nSeveral fans also complained about the mismanagement of the event. The circuit organisers demanded food and drink to be paid in token coin instead of cash or credit card. Fans had to wait for more than two hours for food to be prepared following a website crash.\nPractice.\nThere were three practice sessions for the event. The first practice session started on 9 September at 14:00 local time () and ended with Charles Leclerc fastest, followed by Carlos Sainz Jr. and George Russell. The second practice session, which started at 17:00, ended with Sainz fastest, followed by Max Verstappen and Leclerc. The third practice session, which started on 10 September at 13:00 local time, ended with Verstappen fastest, followed by Leclerc and Sergio Pérez.\nQualifying.\nQualifying took place on 10 September at 16:00 local time. Charles Leclerc took pole position with Max Verstappen qualifying second and Carlos Sainz Jr. third.\nRace.\nRace report.\nThe race took place on 11 September 2022 at 15:00 local time, lasting 53 laps. Charles Leclerc led away from pole, George Russell and Lando Norris behind. Max Verstappen came to third position on lap 4 and second on lap 5. Sergio Pérez came to the pit earlier on lap 10 for hard tyres and rejoined the track with an ongoing brake fire, which later extinguished itself. On lap 10, Sebastian Vettel stopped his car due to engine issues resulting a deployment of a virtual safety car (VSC). This prompted Leclerc to change his tyres, as less time is lost when pitting under VSC conditions, surrending the lead to Verstappen. On lap 26, Leclerc retook the lead after Verstappen changed his tyres, Verstappen rejoined the track ten seconds behind Leclerc. Alpine decided to retire Fernando Alonso car on lap 31 in the pitlane due to a water pressure issue. Leclerc made a second pitstop on lap 34, giving Verstappen the lead. Lance Stroll retired on lap 39 due to similar engine issue suffered by his teammate Sebastian Vettel on lap 10. Daniel Ricciardo stopped his car due to the oil leak suffered from his car resulting in the safety car being deployed until the end of the race. The race was ended on lap 53 with Verstappen winning the race behind safety car.\nSafety car criticism.\nThe safety car procedure following Ricciardo's retirement drew scrutiny, with discussions surrounding the decisions taken, after it turned out that marshals could not move the car expeditiously. The incident caused the race to be ended under the safety car. Charles Leclerc and Lando Norris expressed their frustration over the safety car race ending. Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto and Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner gave their opinion: Binotto stated he disagreed with the FIA's decision to end the race under safety car and accused them of sleeping during the race, while Horner stated that it was not the manner he wanted to finish the race and thought that the race should have been red flagged. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff defended the FIA's decision, stating that the FIA followed the rules while also citing the safety car procedure at the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The FIA later defended their decision to end the race with safety car citing the inability to move Ricciardo's car from the circuit on time. FIA has also invited the team principals for a summit to discuss the regulation changes regarding the yellow flag and safety car on 12 September with no agreement reached between parties so far.\nRace classification.\nNotes"

Originally scheduled from June 21 to 28, 2020, it was rescheduled to June 4 to 7, 2021, (wave I) and June 13 to 20, 2021, (wave II) due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in the postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics to 2021. The meet served as the national championships in swimming for the United States. Those qualifying competed for the United States in swimming at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.\nQualification criteria.\nA maximum of 52 swimmers (26 of each sex, not including open water swimmers) were chosen for the 2020 Summer Olympics from Wave II. To make the Olympic team, a swimmer must place in the top two in one of the fourteen individual events. To be considered for the U.S. 4×100-meter and 4×200-meter freestyle relay teams, a swimmer must place in the top six in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle, respectively. Swimmers must have achieved a time standard to be eligible to compete in the U.S. Olympic trials:\nTwo wave structure.\nIn January 2021, USA Swimming announced its decision to break the Olympic trials into two meets called waves.

Each wave had a different set of qualification time standards. The time standards took effect January 28, 2021 and an initial qualifying period for both waves ended May 30, 2021. Wave I swimmers who met the time standards for Wave II at the Wave I meet and finished first or second in their event qualified to compete at the Wave II meet. Finals for Wave I were conducted in an A-final and B-final format.\nA total of 50 swimmers from Wave I qualified to compete in Wave II. The first swimmer who swam in the Wave I meet and advanced to a second swim, semifinal or final, at the Wave II meet was Heather MacCausland in the women's 100-meter breaststroke on June 14, 2021. The most watched YouTube video from the entire Olympic trials came from Wave I not Wave II. It was a clip of Kayla Han winning the B-final of the women's 400-meter individual medley and breaking a USA Swimming national age group record in the process.\nBetween Wave I and Wave II, 2,285 individuals competed at the 2020 Olympic trials, a decrease of over 700 swimmers from the 2016 Olympic trials. As a whole, proportionally fewer Wave I swimmers and proportionally more Wave II swimmers swam faster than their seed times compared to swimmers at the 2016 Olympic trials.\nEvents.\nThe meet featured twenty-eight individual events in a long course (50-meter) pool—fourteen events for men and fourteen events for women. Events 200 meters and shorter were held with preliminaries, semifinals and finals, while events 400 meters and longer were held with preliminaries and finals.

The tournament took place, behind closed doors, at the Marshall Arena, Milton Keynes, from 18 to 26 July 2020.\nRob Cross was the defending champion, having won his first World Matchplay title with an 18–13 win over Michael Smith in the 2019 final. However, he was beaten 10–8 by Gabriel Clemens in the first round.\nDimitri Van den Bergh became the first unseeded player since James Wade in 2006 to reach the World Matchplay final; like Wade, Van den Bergh was making his debut in the competition. He went on to win his first major title, beating Gary Anderson 18–10 in the final. Van den Bergh was the first debutant to win the World Matchplay, excluding Larry Butler's win in the inaugural tournament. \nThe tournament was moved from its planned venue of Winter Gardens, Blackpool, due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the first and so far only time the tournament has not been held in Blackpool.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund remained at £700,000, with the winner's earnings being £150,000.\nFormat.\nAll games have to be won by two clear legs, with a game being extended if necessary for a maximum of six extra legs before a tie-break leg is required. For example, in a first to 10 legs first round match, if the score reaches 12-12 then the 25th leg will be the decider. The first round is played first to 10 legs, second round first to 11 legs, quarter finals first to 16 legs, semi final first to 17 legs and final first to 18 legs.\nQualification.\nUnder the published rules, the top 16 players on the PDC Order of Merit as of 12 July 2020 were seeded for the tournament.

        "text": "The American Basketball League was the first independent professional basketball league for women in the United States. The ABL lasted two full seasons: 1996–97 and 1997–98. On December 22, 1998; with almost no warning, the ABL declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy and suspended operations. Each team had played between 12 and 15 games of the 1998–99 season. \nTelevision package.\nUltimately, the ABL never did land a major TV contract. None of the ABL games were broadcast nationally or on prime television channels for basketball. \nSportsChannel.\nWhen the ABL began operations in 1996, its games were carried by the SportsChannel regional networks and Black Entertainment Television (BET) under a two-year contract. SportsChannel would televise 12 games on Sunday nights while BET would televise only 8 games on Saturday nights. SportsChannel televised the San Jose Lasers' opening game on Friday, October 25, 1996 and would televise their January 5 game against the Richmond Rage.\nBET.\nBET initially would televise eight Saturday night games, starting with the New England Blizzard at the Columbus Quest on January 4, 1997 and ending with a playoff semifinal February 22. New England home games on January 25 and February 15 would also be shown during the 1996–97 season. \nCome the second year, the ABL's television package included 36 games combined on Fox Sports Net and BET. \nDuring 1997, the ABL averaged a 0.6 rating while rival league, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) scored nearly a 2 rating on NBC. A rating point is equal to 980,000 TV households. Besides NBC's weekly game, ESPN and the Lifetime channel also each got a weekly WNBA game. That's a total weekly exposure of 130 million homes, more than double the 66 million the ABL reached on SportsChannel and BET.\nBET was scheduled to televise 12 games on Saturday nights. After broadcasting four games in December 1997, the remaining eight would be aired starting on January 4 and the following Saturdays through February. The ABL's revenue came solely from the BET. In comparison, the WNBA (as previously mentioned) boasted major television deals with NBC, ESPN, and the Lifetime cable network. BET would use the games to build a lead-in audience for reruns of \"227\".\nFox Sports Net.\nWhen league officials were negotiating with Fox Sports Net, it was in revision of a contract that the league signed with Fox Sports Net's forerunner, Prime Network. The ABL games were often broadcast on tape delay on BET and Fox Sports Net.\nAll the while, the ABL had paid a fee to have two games of its championship series aired on CBS had the 1998–99 season been played in full and 16 games on Fox Sports Net, which at the time consisted 22 regional sports cable channels, up to seven playoff games, including all of the best-of-5 ABL championship series. \nFox Sports Net's primary broadcast team included Tracy Warren (play-by-play), Debbie Antonelli (color commentary), and Heather Cox (sideline reporter). Also utilized by Fox Sports Net were Ron Barr (play-by-play) and Debbie Gore (color commentary)."

        "text": "The 2020 NWSL Challenge Cup was a tournament during the 2020 National Women's Soccer League season to mark the league's return to action from the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first professional team sports event to return to play in United States.\nOriginally planned as a one-off tournament, the NWSL announced that the Challenge Cup would return in the 2021 NWSL season as a league cup competition.\nFormat.\nThe Challenge Cup was originally planned as a 25-game tournament featuring all nine NWSL clubs. However, on June 22, the Orlando Pride withdrew following six positive COVID-19 tests among players and four more among non-playing staff. On June 23, the NWSL released the revised schedule of an 8-team, 23-game tournament.\nOn June 22, the NWSL announced the full rules and regulations for the tournament. Each team would play four games in a preliminary round, with eight teams advancing to a single-elimination knockout bracket. Teams would be ranked by points in the preliminary round, with three points for a win and one for a draw, and the rankings used to determine seeding in the knockout bracket.\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo lessen the impact of fixture congestion caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, NWSL clubs were permitted to roster up to 28 players (a temporary increase by two), to have the full roster available for substitutions during a game, and to make up to five substitutions in accordance with temporary rules and regulations from the International Football Association Board. There would be no extra time; any games in the knockout round that were tied after regulation would go straight to a penalty shoot-out. Final tournament rosters had to be submitted by June 21.\nIn order to hold the tournament as safely as possible, all games were held behind closed doors in two stadiums near Salt Lake City, Utah. All teams were quarantined during the entirety of the tournament in a so-called \"NWSL village\" with all housing provided by Dell Loy Hansen, owner of Utah Royals FC. All players, officials, and essential staff members were tested for the coronavirus 48 hours before departure for Utah and remained subject to regular testing, temperature reading, and symptom review throughout the tournament.\nSquads.\nNWSL teams were required to submit finalized rosters to participate in the 2020 NWSL Challenge Cup on June 21. Roster sizes were required to be a minimum of 22 players and maximum of 28 players (24 senior players + 4 supplemental players) and contain at least three goalkeepers. Only players listed on that final roster are permitted to participate in the tournament. International players already under contract by NWSL teams but not participating in the tournament do not count towards the roster limit. Furthermore, teams could sign a maximum of 4 players they had the rights to but were not yet under contract to short-term contracts lasting the duration of the tournament. Short-term loans from teams outside the NWSL were also permissible.\nPlayer participation for the tournament was optional. The league allowed players to opt out without being in breach of contract, keeping all contracts, housing, insurance and other benefits guaranteed regardless of participation in the tournament.\nSquads were announced on June 23. OL Reign announced that United States international Megan Rapinoe had decided to opt out, while Julia Ashley and Leah Pruitt were unavailable due to long-term injuries. Two more U.S. internationals, Tobin Heath (Portland Thorns FC) and Christen Press (Utah Royals FC), announced their decisions to opt out. Sky Blue FC omitted U.S. internationals Carli Lloyd and Mallory Pugh, as well as Caprice Dydasco, all recovering from injuries. Merritt Mathias was unavailable due to a long-term injury for the North Carolina Courage, while Chicago Red Stars were missing Alyssa Mautz and Arin Wright due to a long-term injury and maternity leave respectively. All of the remaining teams — including the Orlando Pride, who withdrew from the tournament — named their full rosters.\nPreliminary round.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the preliminary round was held on June 1, 2020, 12:00 ET, and streamed live on CBS Sports HQ. The nine NWSL teams were drawn randomly into nine slots, which determined each team's four-game schedule for the preliminary round. After the draw concluded, the NWSL released the full schedule of the preliminary round to be played at Zions Bank Stadium.\nThe Orlando Pride withdrew from the tournament on June 22, 2020, after receiving multiple positive COVID-19 test results among the team's players and staff. One day later, the NWSL accordingly released a revised tournament schedule.\nStandings.\nTiebreakers.\nThe initial determining factor for a team's position in the standings is most points earned, with three points earned for a win, one point for a draw, and zero points for a loss. If two or more teams are equal on points after completion of the preliminary round, the following criteria shall be applied to determine team rankings:\nSchedule.\n\"All game times are listed in MDT.\"\nKnockout round.\nIn the knockout round, if a game was level at the end of 90 minutes of normal playing time, there would be no extra time and the winners would be determined by a penalty shoot-out.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=bracket /&gt;\n\"All game times are listed in MDT.\"\nStatistics.\nDiscipline.\nA player would be automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:\nNo suspensions were served during the tournament.\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament: The MVP (most outstanding player as voted by the media and sponsored by Budweiser), Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Glove (best goalkeeper as voted by the media and sponsored by Verizon), NWSL Future Legend (the top-performing player in their first season with the NWSL), and Best XI (the best 11-players as voted by the players, media, fans, and GMs/coaches, and presented by Google).\nBroadcasting.\nIn accordance with the broadcast deals signed by the NWSL at the start of the 2020 season, both the tournament opener and final aired on CBS. All other games were broadcast live on the CBS All Access subscription service in the U.S. and Canada and re-aired on CBS Sports Network. International fans were able to stream the full tournament on Twitch."

        "text": "The Cupa României is a rugby union cup competition for Romanian teams which has been held annually since 1914 except for a couple of years where the cup was not held either because of World War II or other unknown reasons. It is the country's main cup competition, although not being open to all clubs affiliated with the Federaţia Română de Rugby (FRR) like in previous editions and only being open to the teams competing in the CEC Bank SuperLiga. In late March, it was announced that Tomitanii Constanța would not participate in the Cupa României for the 2021 season due to financial reasons.\nHistory.\nThe Cupa României, like the SuperLiga was set up in 1914 as the main cup competition in Romania and was only competed by two teams which were Tennis Club Român and Sporting Club, both from București. This two team competition continued until the 1920s and 1930s where the number of clubs in the capital had increased due to the popularity of the tournament in the capital especially. But the Cupa României was cancelled again (after the first two time in 1917 and 1918 which was due to World War One), in 1940 and 1942 because of the second World War caused by Nazi Germany at the time. After the war had ended, the birth of eternal rivals CSA Steaua Bucuresti and CS Dinamo București had arrived, consequently meaning the Cupa României was being dominated by the militarii (military) and poliţişti (police) respectively during the 1950s era with only one side standing in both of their ways, which was Energia ISP București.\nHowever, despite the growth of interest from Romanian fans in the Cupa României, it was not held between 1960 and 1972 for unknown reasons yet during this time, Stadiul Român along with seventeen more teams were founded in București-only while outside of the capital, teams were being founded finally after years of rugby being dominant in București. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Cupa României started to become more national in terms of the fact that teams like Știința Petroșani, Rulmentul Bârlad, Farul Constanța and Sibiu were winning the cup and beating most of the teams in București with style and grace.\nIn recent years although, the Cupa României has been restricted to teams in the SuperLiga only instead of being open to all teams in Romania possibly in an attempt to improve the standard of the game in the whole country after the collapse of communism in Romania back in 1989 where the number of clubs and players had decreased significantly in the aftermath. The current champions of the Cupa României are CSA Steaua Bucuresti who beat SCM Timișoara in a close 25–23 game in December 2022."

        "text": "The 2020–21 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2020–21 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Hoyas, led by fourth-year head coach Patrick Ewing, were members of the Big East Conference. Although the Hoyas normally play their home games at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., public-health restrictions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic forced Georgetown to play its home games on campus at McDonough Gymnasium without fans.\nUConn (Connecticut) joined the Big East Conference this season. Like Georgetown a founding member of the original Big East Conference of 1979–2013, UConn had remained behind in the old conference — which renamed itself the American Athletic Conference, marketed as \"The American\" — when Georgetown and six other schools left it to form the new Big East Conference in 2013. Georgetown and UConn had played only twice since then, in non-conference games in 2016 and 2017, but UConn's move to the Big East allowed the conference rivalry between the schools to resume in 2020–2021.\nUConn's move to the Big East also expanded the Big East regular season. Beginning in 2020–2021, each Big East team was scheduled to play 20 regular-season conference games rather than the 18 they had played each year from the 2013–2014 through 2019–2020 seasons. However, the cancellation of some games during 2020-2021 due to COVID-19 issues resulted in only two teams playing their full slate of 20 games. The Hoyas played only 16 conference games during the 2020–2021 season.\nDespite having nine new players and a preseason consensus that they would finish at the bottom of the Big East, the Hoyas had an unexpectedly successful season. They finished in eighth place in the Big East during the regular season, then won the 2021 Big East men's basketball tournament — their first Big East championship since 2007 — to earn an automatic bid to the 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, their first appearance in the tournament since 2015. They lost in the first round to Colorado.\nPrevious season.\nThe Hoyas finished the 2019–20 season at 15–17, 5–13 in Big East play, and tied for eighth place in the conference. As the No. 8 seed in the Big East tournament, they lost in the first round to St. John's. The following day, the remainder of the Big East tournament and all other NCAA postseason play was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Georgetown finished the season with an overall losing record for the third time in five years and with a 5–13 conference record for the third time in four years.\nRoster.\nNotes: (1) On December 18, Georgetown announced that Jalen Harris was taking a leave of absence from the team for \"family reasons;\" he did not return. (2) Chuma Azinge was a \"recruited walk-on.\"\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"|Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"|NCAA tournament"

        "title": "2021 Wimbledon Championships",
        "text": "The 2021 Wimbledon Championships was a Grand Slam tennis tournament that took place at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom, the first since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Novak Djokovic successfully defended his gentlemen's singles title to claim his record-equalling 20th major title, defeating Matteo Berrettini in the final. Simona Halep was the defending ladies' singles champion from 2019, but she withdrew from the competition due to a calf injury. The Ladies' Singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who defeated Karolína Plíšková in the final.\nFollowing the cancellation of the 2020 tournament because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the main tournament began on Monday 28 June 2021 and finished on Sunday 11 July 2021. The 2021 Championships were the 134th edition, the 127th staging of the ladies' singles Championship event, the 53rd in the Open Era and the third Grand Slam tournament of the year. It was played on grass courts and is part of the ATP Tour, the WTA Tour, the ITF Junior Circuit and the ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour. The tournament was organised by the All England Lawn Tennis Club and International Tennis Federation.\nThis was the final edition of Wimbledon to have no matches scheduled on \"Middle Sunday.\" It would also be the final competitive tournament for eight-time champion Roger Federer.\nTournament.\nThe 2021 Wimbledon Championships were the 134th edition of the tournament and were held at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London. The Championships were initially held at 50% capacity, before increasing to full capacity in the second week. Spectators were required to have tested negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours prior to attendance or to be fully vaccinated.\nThe tournament was run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is included in the 2021 ATP Tour and the 2021 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of men's (singles and doubles), women's (singles and doubles), mixed doubles, boys (under 18 – singles and doubles) and girls (under 18 – singles and doubles), which were also a part of the Grade A category of tournaments for under 18, and singles &amp; doubles events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the Uniqlo Tour under the Grand Slam category, also hosting singles and doubles events for wheelchair quad tennis for the first time.\nThe tournament was played on grass courts; main draw matches were played at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, Wimbledon. Qualifying matches were played, from Monday 21 June to Friday 25 June 2021, at the Bank of England Sports Ground, Roehampton. The Tennis Sub-Committee met to decide wild card entries on 14 June.\nThe gentlemen's seedings formula used since 2002 was not used. Seedings used the standard system based on ATP rankings.\nNo invitation doubles events were held during this edition of the tournament.\nPoint distribution and prize money.\nAs a Grand Slam tournament, the points for Wimbledon are the highest of all ATP and WTA tournaments. These points determine the world ATP and WTA rankings for men's and women's competition, respectively. Because of the smaller draws and the pandemic, all men's and women's doubles players that made it past the first round received half the points of their singles counterparts, a change from previous years where singles and doubles players received the same number of points in all but the first two rounds. In both singles and doubles, women received slightly higher point totals compared to their male counterparts at each round of the tournament, except for the first and last. Points and rankings for the wheelchair events fall under the jurisdiction of the ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour, which also places Grand Slams as the highest classification.\nThe ATP and WTA rankings were both altered in 2020, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both rankings were frozen on 16 March 2020 upon the suspension of both tours, and as a result the traditional 52-week ranking system was extended to cover the period from March 2019 to March 2021 with a player's best 18 results in that time period factoring into their point totals.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is the tables with the point distribution for each phase of the tournament.\nPrize money.\nThe Wimbledon Championships total prize money for 2021 decreased by 7.85% to £35,016,000. However, the prize money figure does not include the substantial investment required to provide quality accommodation for the players, or to create a minimised risk environment and comprehensive testing programme."

It also features the ability to customize the player character.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"Japan Pro Golf Tour 64\"s late release has made the game a prized collector's item. It is the 64DD's rarest and most sought-after released game. Original copies typically demand high prices on various online auction sites and used game stores, even having exceeded as much as 7000$.\nReception and legacy.\n\"Japan Pro Golf Tour 64\" received favorable reviews. A reviewer for the Spanish magazine \"Magazine 64\" described it as \"a beautiful golf game\", commenting on its character creation mechanic and the usage of real-world golf players. \"IGN\"s Peer Schneider claimed its realism set it apart from more arcade-style games like \"Mario Golf\", and made for a great golf game for the Nintendo 64. Scheider expressed confusion and disappointment in Media Factory for choosing to make the game for the 64DD, a phased-out platform, instead of on a standard Nintendo 64 cartridge; he wrote that the company shouldn't have \"[gotten] suckered into making this title\". Four reviewers from \"Famitsu\" were enthusiastic towards its realistic controls, the net tournament mode, and the inclusion of real Japanese courses. Though the reviewers were critical of its lack of gamemodes, they found it an entertaining game overall."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Pirates represent East Carolina University in the NCAA's American Athletic Conference.\nEast Carolina began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1931. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but East Carolina's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bears represent the University of Central Arkansas (UCA) in men's basketball as members of the NCAA Division I ASUN Conference.\nCentral Arkansas began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1920. It initially played in Amateur Athletic Union (AAU)-sponsored competitions, and later in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). UCA did not join the NCAA until 1993, playing in Division II until moving to Division I in 2006. This history is significant because the official recording of statistics began at different times in different organizations, as well as different NCAA divisions. The NAIA record books do not indicate when the organization began officially recording statistics on a national basis, but its current records (as of 2020–21) for single-game and single-season assists were both set in 1972–73, and the career record for blocks dates to 1975. By the time UCA joined the NCAA, that body had begun recording all major statistics on a national basis.\nThe UCA record books include players in all named statistics, regardless of whether they were officially recorded by any of the governing bodies in which the school was a member. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The single bid was announced on 12 December 2019. The bid entailed playing at 10 venues in 10 host cities, with the final held at the Estadio El Campín in Bogotá.\nBackground.\nIn 2016 the Colombian Football Federation indicated an interest to formalize the candidacy of Colombia as host country. Colombia previously hosted the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2016 FIFA Futsal World Cup. One of the requirements to host the World Cup is to have a national women's league, and in 2017 the Colombian Women's Football League played its first season. On 26 January 2019, Colombian President Iván Duque Márquez indicated that he had every intention of applying for Colombia to host the 2023 Women's World Cup.\nProposed venues.\nThe following host cities, venues and capacities were included in the Bid Book submitted to FIFA:\nControversy.\nFalsehoods in the candidacy.\nIn the document sent for evaluation, some media pointed out a series of inaccuracies in it, for example, they cited that Colombia had organized the 2019 Pan American Games, being these played in Lima, besides indicating euphemisms such as \"The Colombian women's tournament is among the most successful in the continent with 20,60 players, with an average attendance of 28,000 spectators in the finals of each championship\". In Colombia, the Women's League has had three editions, being short tournaments with players earning minimum wages and needing additional jobs to survive, which raises doubts about its success.\nResult.\nColombia was unsuccessful in its bid for the hosting rights to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup on 25 June 2020. In a vote of 35 eligible members of the FIFA Council, the bid received 13 votes to Australia and New Zealand's 22. Council members from CONMEBOL and UEFA voted for the bid. FIFA President Gianni Infantino voted for the Australia-New Zealand bid, alongside all council members from the Asian and Oceanian confederations, as well as those from CONCACAF and the Confederation of African Football.

Teams played 16 regular-season games from late May to late September, with a four-team playoff for the championship trophy, the Steinfeld Trophy.\nFox Sports Net (2001–2003).\nFor Major League Lacrosse's first two seasons of existence, their games were broadcast on Fox Sports Net. The package called for 12 regular season telecasts on Sunday afternoons beginning in the second week of June and running through MLL Championship Game on Labor Day Weekend. \nFox Sports Net employed Mike Crispino, Quint Kessenich, and Brian Kilmeade as commentators.\nESPN2 (2003–2012).\nESPN2 televised a weekly MLL game on Tuesday afternoons from 2003 through 2011. In 2012, ESPN2 televised three regular season games, the All-Star Game, one semifinal, and the MLL Championship game. MLL games have not been regularly shown on ESPN2 since 2012 due to low ratings. Games continue to be streamed on ESPN3.\nESPN2 used Joe Beninati and Quint Kessenich as their commentary team. Other announcers that ESPN3 employed were play-by-play announcers Todd Bell, Jason Chandler, Mike Evans, Scott Garceau, Eamon McAnaney, Dave Ryan and Tom Werme, along with analysts Paul Carcaterra, Brian Shanahan, Evan Washburn and Ron Zwerin.\nCBS Sports Network (2013–2017) and Lax Sports Network (2018).\nCBS Sports Network has televised all-star games and the playoffs since 2013. MLL did not receive any money from these networks for these deals.\nCBS Sports Network was scheduled to nationally televise 14 games in 2012. Dave Ryan and Evan Washburn were employed as commentators. CBS Sports Network also produced about 18 episodes a year of \"Inside The MLL\", which was a 30-minute show hosted by Evan Washburn that covered the previous week's games and the current league news.\nThe first game that CBS Sports Network televised was a game at from Sports Authority Field at Mile High between the Rochester Rattlers and the Denver Outlaws on Saturday, May 18, 2013. The game aired on a one hour same-day delay at 10:00 p.m. ET. CBS Sports Network was also scheduled to televise the Semi-Final Game later that August.\nIn 2017, Lax Sports Network was given exclusive rights to all 63 regular season games. Eric Frede and Brendan McDaniels were employed by LAX Sports Network as commentators. Twitter streamed the semifinal games and CBS Sports Network broadcast the final.\nStadium, ESPN+, and ESPN2 (2019–2020).\nOn April 1, 2019, the league announced they had reacquired broadcast rights from Lax Sports Network. It was unclear where each team would broadcast its games, though the Boston Cannons announced on March 28 that NBC Sports Boston would air all 16 of their games.\nOne day prior to the start of the 2019 season, the league announced that 12 games would be broadcast on Stadium and the network would air a weekly studio show.\nThe league also announced that they would renew its partnership with ESPN and stream a \"Game of the Week\" throughout the season on the network's streaming service ESPN+. Furthermore, the 2019 All-Star Game and Championship Game would air on ESPN2. Joe Beninati and Quint Kessenich were again used as the primary broadcast team with Mark Dixon and Don Zimmerman serving as the secondary crew.\nFollowing an abbreviated 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MLL announced a merger with the Premier Lacrosse League. With the merger, MLL ceased to exist as a separate entity."

The Gamecocks represent the University of South Carolina in the NCAA's Southeastern Conference.\nSouth Carolina began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1908. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but South Carolina's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The BYU Cougars basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the BYU Cougars men's basketball program in various categories, including points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Cougars represent Brigham Young University in the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference.\nBYU began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1902. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but BYU's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2022–23 season."

The Hilltoppers were led by future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach Edgar Diddle and consensus All-American, Tom Marshall. The Hilltoppers won the Ohio Valley Conference championship, and were invited to the 1954 National Invitation Tournament, where they were seeded as the number 2 team and advanced to the semifinals. For the NIT consolation game against fourth seeded Niagara, Coach Diddle looked to build experience for the next year’s team, only allowing his freshman and sophomores to play. During this period, the NIT was considered on par with the NCAA tournament.\nThis was one of the finest teams in Western Kentucky history, they led the NCAA in wins and Marshall averaged more than 25 points and nearly 15 rebounds per game, setting school records for scoring and rebounding. Art Spoelstra, Jack Turner and Lynn Cole joined Marshall on the All-Conference and OVC Tournament teams.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=6| Regular Season\n!colspan=6| 1954 Ohio Valley Conference Tournament\n!colspan=6| 1954 National Invitation Tournament"

Bertin called a halt to the contest after defending WBO Africa super-bantamweight champion Sackey was knocked down by Mohammed in the third round.

        "text": "Charles Brown (February 24, 1936 – August 26, 2022), nicknamed Sweet Charlie, was an American basketball player, known for his All-American college career at Seattle University, as well as his role as a part of two championship teams at DuSable High School in Chicago.\nHigh school career.\nAlong with Shellie McMillon and Paxton Lumpkin, Brown was a part of a nucleus of players that formed a formidable DuSable team that won Chicago Public League championships in the 1952–53 and 1953–54 seasons. In 1954, the team advanced to the Illinois state finals as the first all-black team to compete \"downstate.\" Locally dubbed the \"Wonder Five,\" the team lost the championship game 72–70 to Mt. Vernon. Brown was named to the all-tournament team and in 2006 was named one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament in celebration of the Illinois High School Association's 100th season.\nCollege career.\nBrown started his college career at Indiana, enrolling along with high school teammate Lumpkin in Fall 1954 as a part of a recruiting class that also included future National Basketball Association (NBA) player Archie Dees. Freshmen were not eligible to play varsity sports per NCAA rules of the time, but the heralded freshmen narrowly lost to the defending national champion varsity team in a preseason game – partly due to intervention by the coaching staff, including benching the sweet-shooting Brown once the freshmen had built a sizable lead.\nBrown prepared to join the varsity for the 1955–56 season, but there was controversy as Brown and Lumpkin played with their former DuSable teammates in an amateur AAU tournament in April. This violated a Big Ten Conference rule that athletes could not compete as a representative of anyone other than their schools without forfeiting a year of eligibility. However, Hoosiers coach Branch McCracken successfully appealed the decision as the players had sought guidance prior to appearing in the event. Brown joined the Hoosiers for the season and quickly established himself as a scoring threat, averaging 14.8 points in the team's first 12 games and leading the team in scoring in Big Ten contests. His Hoosier career came to an end on January 31, 1956, when it was announced that Brown would be academically ineligible for the second semester. Brown left Indiana after this decision.\nBrown chose Seattle to compete his college career, sitting out he 1956–57 season as a transfer and joining the team and its star Elgin Baylor for the 1957–58 campaign. Brown, with his strong outside shooting, rebounding and defense, proved to be a good complement to the All-American Baylor. He averaged 10.6 points on the year, good for second on the team. During the 1958 NCAA tournament, Brown hit two clutch shots in the Chieftains' West Regional Final against California in San Francisco. He first hit a mid-range jump shot with ten seconds remaining to send the game into overtime. He then hit a 25-foot shot with ten seconds left in overtime to seal the 66–62 win and a spot in the school's first Final Four. In the Final Four, the Chieftains upset favored Kansas State, but lost the championship game to Kentucky.\nWith the departure of Baylor to the NBA, the Chieftains did not make the NCAA Tournament the next season, though they did achieve a season record of 23–6. Brown did enjoy a larger role with the team, settling into his role as the top scoring option. At the close of the season, Brown was named a third-team All-American by United Press International (UPI) after averaging 18 points and 11 rebounds per game.\nPost-college career and death.\nAfter the close of his college career, Brown was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals in the 11th round (72nd pick overall) of the 1959 NBA draft. However, he did not play in the NBA, instead joining the Army and then playing Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball in Seattle and Chicago. He then settled into a career as a social worker in Chicago, but remained active in basketball as a high school referee and an organizer of local tournaments and leagues.\nAfter sustaining injuries from a fall, Brown died on August 26, 2022, at the age of 86."

The Rebels represent the University of Mississippi in the NCAA's Southeastern Conference.\nOle Miss began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1908. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Ole Miss's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

        "title": "Johns Hopkins–Navy lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Johns Hopkins–Navy lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays and Navy Midshipmen. While historical rivals in football, the lacrosse series has been the headlining competition between the two universities. The Maryland programs were both national powers prior to NCAA sponsorship of the sport, with 35 national titles for the Blue Jays and 17 for the Midshipmen. They both continue to rank one-two in the most total national championships of any program in collegiate lacrosse. While both mainstays on the national stage in the modern era, Hopkins has dominated Navy head-to-head, winning 36 consecutive from 1975 to 2009. The series, annual since 1950 was halted in 2017 due to scheduling issues from conference realignment, as the longtime independents joined the Patriot League and Big Ten Conference respectively in the last decade. A 2020 renewal was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was instead renewed in 2022. As of 2024, Johns Hopkins leads the series 63–29–1. \nSeries history.\nEarly years (1900s to 1960s).\nJohns Hopkins bested the Midshipmen in the inaugural meeting by a score of 6 to 1. Navy gained its first win in the series in 1910, as the game was played on a semi-annual basis through 1928. The Midshipmen defeated the Jays in 1928 and would share the USILA Gold Medal with Johns Hopkins, Maryland, and Rutgers. The hiatus began with a relatively even series; Navy led 9–7–1. The two would reconcile in 1943 in Annapolis, before resuming the series in 1946 and playing annually from 1949 to 2017.\nPost-World War II resumption began with five consecutive Jays victories, their longest streak to that point. Notably, the state rivals did not meet during the 1949 campaign, as the Navy ended with an undefeated 11–0 record but had to settle for a split national championship with Hopkins. Navy would respond by reeling off four straight victories over Hopkins, but the Jays would counter by winning the next three. Up to this point, both teams were title contenders each season, with Hopkins winning five titles and Navy winning three since resumption. 1959 marked a crucial turning point. Johns Hopkins would claim the national title, but Navy downed the Jays 13–11 to deny them a perfect season. This was the first of eight consecutive Midshipmen victories under coach Willis Bilderback, their longest streak in the rivalry. The last seven of these coincided with Navy national titles and preeminence over the sport. In 1967, Johns Hopkins broke the streak with a 9–6 defeat of Navy, but the teams would ultimately share the USILA championship with Maryland. 1969 featured a three-goal victory for the Midshipmen in Baltimore, the most recent time that they have won the rivalry game on the road at Homewood Field. In 1970, Navy and the Jays would again share the title, this time with Virginia, as Hopkins handed Navy their only defeat on the season.\nHopkins dominance (1970s through 2000s).\n1971 marked the first year in the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship era. Though a Division III program in most sports, Hopkins was grandfathered into Division I for men's lacrosse, enabling the Navy rivalry to continue. That 1971 season the teams played a rare neutral matchup, held in Houston, the first college lacrosse game ever played in the state of Texas. Played in front of nearly 20,000 spectators at the Astrodome to set a single-game NCAA attendance record, the game has been credited for increasing Texan interest in the sport. Navy felled the Jays, as they finished with a rare losing season at 3–7 and missed the inaugural tournament. Hopkins would win its first NCAA title in 1974 but dropped its regular season matchup with Navy. The #6 Midshipmen upset the #2 Jays 13–12 in Annapolis. The next year would not be as successful against Hopkins for Navy, losing 16–11, but the Midshipmen would end the season as the national runner-up.\nThat matchup in 1974 would be the last for Navy against their in-state rivals for 36 years. The streak is further unprecedented by the fact that the Midshipmen were consistently good on the national stage. From the introduction of the USILA polls in 1973, all but one Hopkins–Navy meeting was between two Top 10 teams until the 1990 contest. All games were between ranked teams until 1996, when Navy entered unranked. The nature of the streak carries comparisons with Navy's college football rivalry with Notre Dame, in which the Fighting Irish defeated the Midshipmen for 43 consecutive years, the longest streak between Division I opponents in NCAA history. Navy ended that dubious distinction in 2007 with a 46–44 triple overtime victory and would finally end their losing steak against Hopkins several years later.\nRecent years (2010–present).\n2010 would mark the season that Navy finally got over the hump against their rivals. Prior to the game, longtime Midshipmen coach Richie Meade told his players \"You’re Midshipmen at the Naval Academy, your future leaders and people’s lives are going to be in your hands. You understand the mission, you understand what you’re required to do, and now I want you to go out and get it done.\" Navy rallied from an early five goal deficit, scoring six in the second quarter to take a narrow lead into halftime. After a spirited second half, the game went to overtime tied at eight. Since 2000, three Blue Jays victories came in overtime and 2010 would go down the same route. However, this time Navy prevailed in the extra session to win 9–8.\nTwo seasons later, the Midshipmen put on a spectacular defensive display, holding Hopkins to just two goals in an 8–2 victory. The Jays would win the next five, including a double overtime victory in 2016. The 2017 contest was the first between Top 10 teams since 2008, as the Jays rolled to a comfortable seven goal victory. After that game, the series took a two-year hiatus due to scheduling concerns between the schools, in part due to their recent decisions to join conferences, giving up their historical independent status. A renewal was scheduled in 2020 but the game, along with the entire NCAA season, was cancelled due to concerns stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Mountaineers represent West Virginia University in the NCAA's Big 12 Conference.\nWest Virginia began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1903. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but West Virginia's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Miacomet Golf Course is a public 18-hole golf course on Nantucket. \nHistory.\nIn 1956, Ralph P. Marble, a Michigan-native, bought 400-acres of land on Nantucket with dairy farm intentions. The area he bought was called by the old Wampanoag inhabitants \"Miacomet\", which meant \"The Meeting Place\". Marble stated that he decided to build a golf course because the dairy market was not doing well.\nIn 1960, Marble began building the Miacomet Golf Course. In 1963, the Miacomet Golf Course opened as a public year-round golf course. In the early 1970s, due to a fire, the clubhouse was rebuilt without spending any money as the island community provided donated lumber and free labor to replace the original.\nIn 1983, Marble put the course up for sale and it was planned to be developed into a 216-lot subdivision. In 1985, the Nantucket Island Land Bank (Land Bank) worked with developers to negotiate the purchase of the Miacomet Golf Course for $4.5 million.\nAfter this purchase, the Land Bank made a deal to lease the course operations back to the previous owners who still owned the clubhouse property. During the 1990s, the Land Bank was working on plans to expand this 9-hole course into a 18-hole course.\nIn 2003, the Lank Bank expanded the original 9-hole course into the only public 18-hole course on the island. It was at this point that the previous owners deeded the clubhouse property to the Land Bank in exchange for grandfathered-in course memberships.\nCurrent operations.\nMiacomet Golf Course is currently a public golf course with memberships capped at 400 members. The Land Bank currently contracts course management to Nantucket Golf Management (NGM), Inc, which is the same management team running the Siasconset Golf Club; one of the other golf courses on Nantucket.\nDuring the 41st U.S. Mid-Amateur, Miacomet Golf Course was one of the stroke play co-hosts alongside other co-host Sankaty Head Golf Club."

        "text": "George Warren Lewis is a retired American ice hockey center who helped Boston College win their first national championship in 1949.\nCareer.\nLewis began attending Boston College in 1946, playing for the hockey club in his freshman year and leading the team in points. The NCAA instituted a national tournament the following year and Lewis helped the Eagles reached the inaugural NCAA tournament ultimately falling short. He returned to the ice the next season and combined with Jack Mulhern to produce one of the most potent offensive duos in college hockey. Lewis finished second in team scoring as the Eagles produced a nearly unblemished 19–1 record to earn their second tournament appearance. BC reached the final and faced Dartmouth, the only team who had beaten them all season, but a 3-point game from Lewis helped push the Eagles to a 4–3 win. Despite his scoring heroics, Lewis did not appear on either of the two all-tournament Teams.\nLewis again led the team in scoring, during his senior season, and helped the Eagles reach the tournament for the third consecutive year. They were unable to repeat their performance, surrendering 10 goals in each games to finish in fourth place. Lewis finished his career at BC with the highest goal total and second most points in program history. Because he played relatively few games he has been passed on the all-time list by many succeeding players, but he's still near the top in both points per game and hat-tricks.\nBC records on Lewis' statistics are a bit muddled. The program list him as having scored 65 goals in 54 games, however, it also lists him as scoring 20 goals in 1947, 23 goals in 1949 and 26 goals in 1950. This would leave him with 69 goals in those three years alone. It's likely that the school's totals exclude his first season as that was not played under NCAA oversight. In any event, Lewis was one of the most prolific scorers to wear an Eagles sweater and in recognition of his accomplishments he was inducted into the Boston College Hall of Fame in 1981.\nLewis is the last surviving member of the 1949 championship team."

        "text": "The men's tournament in ice hockey at the 2022 Winter Olympics took place in Beijing, China between 9 and 20 February 2022. Twelve countries qualified for the tournament; eight of them did so automatically by virtue of their ranking by the International Ice Hockey Federation, one, China, automatically qualified as hosts, while the three others took part in a qualification tournament.\nThe Olympic Athletes from Russia team won in 2018. The Russian Olympic Committee, representing Russia at the 2022 Games, were the defending champions.\nFor the first time in history, the Czech Republic did not qualify for the quarter-finals and finished in ninth place, their worst placement in history.\nFinland won their first ever ice hockey Olympic gold medal after going undefeated and beating the Russian Olympic Committee in the final.\nSlovakia claimed their first ever ice hockey medal at the Olympics after defeating Sweden 4–0 and finishing third.\nFormat.\nThe twelve teams were split into three groups of four teams each, in which they will play against each team once. The top team of each group and the best second-ranked team will advance to the quarterfinals, while all other teams play a qualification round. A knockout system will be used after the group stage.\nRosters.\nDue to the lack of ice hockey talent in China, players had to be recruited from abroad. The Chinese men's hockey team was composed of eleven Canadians, nine Chinese, three Americans, and a Russian. Neither the Chinese Olympic Committee, International Ice Hockey Federation nor the IOC commented on how it was possible for foreign players to compete for China, as the Olympic Charter requires competitors to be citizens of the country they represent. According to the nationality law of China, anyone who were naturalized as Chinese citizens, or those who resumed their Chinese nationality, must renounce all the other nationalities, as China does not recognize dual-nationality. The IOC Executive Board has the authority to make certain exceptions of a \"general or individual nature\", though it is unclear whether this was the case. When asked whether he had naturalized as a Chinese citizen, athlete Jake Chelios refused to comment, though he confirmed that he still has his American passport.\nNHL participation.\nOn 10 July 2020, the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and National Hockey League agreed to a renewed collective bargaining agreement, which includes a provision opening the possibility for the NHL to explore participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Olympics. On 22 July 2021, the NHL released a 2021–22 schedule that included an Olympic break, but the league also announced that a final agreement had not yet been reached regarding Olympic participation of NHL players in 2022. On 3 September 2021, an agreement was made to allow NHL players to compete. In December 2021, many NHL players started contracting COVID-19 and several teams temporarily suspended operations while their players were in quarantine. This forced the NHL to postpone some regular season games and due to the rise in cases of COVID-19 worldwide; on 22 December 2021, the NHL announced that NHL players would not be released for participation in the Olympics.\nMatch officials.\n15 referees and 12 linesmen were selected for the tournament.\nPreliminary round.\n\"All times are local (UTC+8).\"\nTiebreak criteria.\nIn each group, teams ranked according to the following criteria:\nGroup A.\n&lt;section begin=AStandings/&gt;&lt;section end=AStandings/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A1/&gt;&lt;section end=A1/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A2/&gt;&lt;section end=A2/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A3/&gt;&lt;section end=A3/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A4/&gt;&lt;section end=A4/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A5/&gt;&lt;section end=A5/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A6/&gt;&lt;section end=A6/&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;section begin=BStandings/&gt;&lt;section end=BStandings/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B1/&gt;&lt;section end=B1/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B2/&gt;&lt;section end=B2/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B3/&gt;&lt;section end=B3/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B4/&gt;&lt;section end=B4/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B5/&gt;&lt;section end=B5/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B6/&gt;&lt;section end=B6/&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;section begin=CStandings/&gt;&lt;section end=CStandings/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C1/&gt;&lt;section end=C1/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C2/&gt;&lt;section end=C2/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C3/&gt;&lt;section end=C3/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C4/&gt;&lt;section end=C4/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C5/&gt;&lt;section end=C5/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C6/&gt;&lt;section end=C6/&gt;\nRanking after preliminary round.\nFollowing the completion of the preliminary round, all teams were ranked 1D through 12D.

        "text": "Kevin Corrigan (born 1958) is a national champion American lacrosse coach. Serving as the head coach for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's lacrosse team since 1988, he is the longest active tenured coach in men's lacrosse at the Division I level.\nPersonal life.\nCorrigan was born in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1958 to an athletic family; his father, Gene Corrigan, and three brothers are all former lacrosse players and coaches. His cousins Lee and Booker Corrigan are also involved in the sport; Lee was the head coach of the Maryland Roughriders and Booker works as an announcer for ESPN.\nCorrigan and his wife have three children together; including a son who played lacrosse for Notre Dame under Corrigan's guidance before becoming an assistant coach at Washington and Lee University.\nCareer.\nPlaying career.\nCorrigan played high school lacrosse at Albemarle High School before attending the University of Virginia. While playing as a midfielder for three seasons, he recorded five goals and six assists.\nCoaching career.\nUpon graduating from the University of Virginia, Corrigan was hired to coach his high school's lacrosse team before accepting an assistant coaching position with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's lacrosse team. Following his one-year stint, he agreed to coach the NCAA Division III lacrosse team at Randolph–Macon College. He returned to his alma mater under head coach Jim Adams before accepting a promotion to Head Coach at the University of Notre Dame. In his first few years at Notre Dame, the team played a mostly NCAA Division III schedule and lacked funding. Therefore, he recruited graduate assistants to work as security guards and the team travelled solely by bus. During his first season as Head coach, he led the team to a 6–7 record. In spite of the lack of early success, every senior player during Corrigan's tenure at Notre Dame has graduated. By 1990, Corrigan's Notre Dame program earned their first United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) national ranking and invitation to the NCAA Championship. Through the mid-1990s, Corrigan's Notre Dame program had moved up to the NCAA Division I level and competed in 10 NCAA tournaments.\nAs a result of his success, Corrigan was tapped as a potential replacement for Dick Edell with the Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse team, alongside Dave Cottle and Gary Gait. He chose to stay at Notre Dame, however, and was the recipient of the 2001 Great Western Lacrosse League Coach of the Year award. In 2009, he received the Frenchy Julien Service Award from the USILA for \"outstanding and continuous service to the sport.\"\nIn 2015, John Baumer and his wife donated $3 million for the University of Notre Dame to endow the head coaching position of the Fighting Irish men's lacrosse team. In his endowed role, Corrigan became the longest active tenured coach in men's lacrosse at the Division I level. Upon entering the 2019 season, he was 24th overall in winningest coaches of all time by percentage, and eighth among those who are active. On April 10, 2019, Corrigan became the third NCAA Division I level lacrosse coach to reach 300 wins, tying him for second in all-time most wins at a single school.\nIn 2023, Corrigan led the Notre Dame Fighting Irish to the NCAA Division 1 National Championship – the first in the program's history."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Panthers represent the University of Pittsburgh in the NCAA's Atlantic Coast Conference.\nPittsburgh began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1905. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Pittsburgh's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2023–24 season."

WKU won the OVC season championship, as well as the conference's automatic bid to the 1971 NCAA University Division basketball tournament. No conference tournament was held, so the conference bid was awarded to the season champion. The Hilltoppers advanced to the NCAA Final Four, though the tournament games were later vacated by the NCAA due to McDaniels having signed a contract with an agent.\nFor the second consecutive year, McDaniels was OVC Player of the Year and set the school record for most points scored in season and career, and highest scoring average. Jerry Dunn and Jim Rose joined McDaniels on the All-OVC Team. This team was one of the most talented in school history with several players being drafted by the NBA and ABA including McDaniels, Dunn, Rose, Clarence Glover, and Jerome Perry.\nCultural Relevance.\nThis year's Western Kentucky team was the first non-historically black Kentucky college to start five African-American players: McDaniels, Rose, Glover, Dunn, and Rex Bailey. Coach Oldham was pressured, and even threatened, not to start all five together, but resisted the pressure saying \"they are my best five players\".\nNCAA Sanctions.\nWKU's NCAA tournament games were later vacated by the NCAA after it was discovered that McDaniels had signed with a professional agent prior to the tournament. \"I admit I made a mistake,\" McDaniels told the Courier-Journal in an interview. \"There was a lot of pressure. I got around some people who did not have my best interests at heart.\" The sanctions reduced their officially recognized record to 20–5.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=6| Regular Season\n!colspan=6| 1971 NCAA University Division basketball tournament"

        "text": "James Stephen Hagan Sr. (February 18, 1938 – May 4, 2021) was an American basketball player. He was an All-American college player at Tennessee Tech before earning similar honors with the Amateur Athletic Union's Phillips 66ers.\nFrom Glendale, Kentucky, Hagan played for Tennessee Tech from 1957 to 1960. While there, the center became one of the best players in program history. The slender big man was known as a prolific scorer with a deft shooting touch, particularly from the free throw line. In his junior season, Hagan used his offensive skill very effectively in coach John Oldham's high post offense. Hagan averaged 28.8 points per game and engaged in a highly publicized national scoring race with eventual scoring leader Oscar Robertson. At the close of the season, Hagan was named first-team All-Ohio Valley Conference and a third-team All-American by the Associated Press.\nIn his senior season, Hagan's scoring average dipped to 24.3 points per game. He was again named All-OVC and was the only unanimous choice for the squad. Hagan left Tennessee Tech holding a number of records - including total career points (1,539, since eclipsed), total career rebounds (1,108), season scoring average (28.8 points per game in 1958–59) and career scoring average (21.1 points per game). He was inducted into the Tennessee Tech athletic Hall of Fame in 1979 and his jersey has been retired by the school.\nFollowing the close of his college career, Hagan was selected by the Minneapolis Lakers in the third round of the 1960 NBA draft (18th pick overall). Concerned that his thin frame might have trouble in a league marked with burly big men, he instead chose to join the Phillips 66ers of the National Industrial Basketball League. With the 66ers, Hagan won an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) championship in 1962 and was named an AAU All-American in 1963 and 1964 before retiring to focus on his business career with Phillips.\nHagan died on May 4, 2021."

        "title": "Tommy DeVito (American football)",
        "text": "Thomas N. DeVito (born August 7, 1998) is an American football quarterback for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Illinois after transferring from Syracuse. He signed with the Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2023.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Livingston, New Jersey, DeVito grew up in nearby Cedar Grove and attended Don Bosco Preparatory High School. He was named first team All-State by MSG and second team All-Metro after passing for 1,800 yards and 18 touchdowns in his junior season as the Ironmen went 9–3 and won the Non-Public 4 state championship. Following his junior year, DeVito competed in the Elite 11 quarterback competition and was named a finalist. As a senior, he passed for 2,005 yards, 16 touchdowns and five interceptions and played in the Under Armour All-American Game. DeVito committed to play college football at Syracuse at the end of his junior year over offers from Yale, Boston College, Penn, Rutgers, Maryland and Temple.\nCollege career.\nSyracuse.\n2018 season.\nDeVito redshirted his true freshman season. He served mostly as the backup to starting quarterback Eric Dungey as a redshirt freshman, playing in eight games off the bench and completing 44 of 87 passes for 525 yards and four touchdowns. DeVito's first significant action came on September 15, 2018, against Florida State, entering the game after Dungey suffered an injury and completing 11 of 16 passes for 144 yards and a touchdown while also rushing for a touchdown as the Orange won 30–7. DeVito again played in relief of an injured Dungey on October 10 against North Carolina, and he led Syracuse to a 40–37 win in double overtime, throwing for 181 yards with three touchdowns and one interception on 11-for-19 passing. \n2019 season.\nAs a redshirt sophomore, DeVito passed for 2,360 yards and 19 touchdowns and rushed for 122 yards and two touchdowns. He passed for a career-high 330 yards, three touchdowns and an interception in a 63–20 loss to Maryland. \n2020 season.\nIn 2020, DeVito completed 48-of-96 pass attempts for 593 yards and four touchdowns through the first four games of the season before suffering a season-ending leg injury against Duke. \n2021 season.\nEntering his fifth year at Syracuse, all with Babers as head coach, DeVito was compared to a franchise quarterback for Syracuse with the two having an intimate and trusting relationship. DeVito began his redshirt senior season as Syracuse's starter, but coach Dino Babers also planned to give meaningful playing time to Garrett Shrader, a dual-threat quarterback who had transferred in from Mississippi State University.\nDeVito played most of the season opener against Ohio University, a 29-9 win, completing 11 of 17 passes for 92 yards and added 47 yards and a touchdown on the ground. The following week, Syracuse lost the home opener against Rutgers University 17–7, with DeVito completing 15 of 25 passing attempts for 149 yards and one interception, five sacks, and one fumble, in split time with Shrader. DeVito mentioned in a postgame interview he knew coach Dino Babers planned to play both quarterbacks during the game. Babers also told the media both quarterbacks would play in the third game against Albany University; and that he planned to make a final decision on the starter based on that game. DeVito was defiant in a press conference before the Albany game, responding, \"I’ve done exactly what I’ve needed to\" when asked if he thought he had earned the starting spot, while also describing how defenses had caught onto the run-pass option (RPO) offense Syracuse was running, and thus it had become a more difficult system to run in the years since Jimmy Garoppolo ran the offense for Babers at Eastern Illinois University to great success.\nDeVito entered the NCAA transfer portal six weeks into the season.\nIllinois.\nDeVito ultimately transferred to Illinois. He was named the Fighting Illini's starting quarterback during fall practices. On October 1, against Wisconsin, DeVito had three rushing touchdowns in the 34–10 victory. In the 2022 season, DeVito passed for 2,650 yards, 15 touchdowns, and four interceptions to go along with six rushing touchdowns. DeVito sought a waiver for an additional year of eligibility from the NCAA to play another season at Illinois, but was denied.\nProfessional career.\nDeVito was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent on April 29, 2023, shortly after the conclusion of the 2023 NFL draft. \nDeVito was waived on August 29, 2023, and re-signed to the practice squad.\nIn Week 8, DeVito made his NFL debut on October 29, 2023, against the New York Jets, after an injury to second-string quarterback Tyrod Taylor. DeVito completed two out of seven pass attempts and was sacked twice, but scored the Giants' only touchdown on a six-yard run. DeVito was signed to the Giants active roster on October 31. In Week 9 he entered the game against the Las Vegas Raiders in relief of an injured Daniel Jones and threw for 175 yards and his first NFL passing touchdown, but also had two interceptions. \nIn Week 10, DeVito was named the starting quarterback for the game against the Dallas Cowboys. DeVito threw for 86 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in a 49–17 loss. In Week 11, DeVito started against the Washington Commanders. He completed 18 of 26 passes for 246 yards and three touchdowns but was sacked nine times. Despite the sacks, the Giants won 31–19, making DeVito the first winning quarterback to be sacked nine times or more in a game since 1992. In Week 12, DeVito started in a 10–7 victory against the New England Patriots. He completed 17 passes in 25 attempts for 191 yards and threw a touchdown pass.\nFollowing their bye week, DeVito led the Giants to their third consecutive victory, defeating the Green Bay Packers 24–22. DeVito went 17 for 21 and 158 passing yards, throwing one TD with no INTs, plus 71 rushing yards on 10 carries. Taking possession with about a minute and a half on the clock, DeVito went 4 for 4 driving his team down the field for the winning field goal by Randy Bullock as time expired. DeVito was named NFC offensive player of the week for his performance. \nAfter losing 24–6 to the New Orleans Saints, DeVito was benched in favor of Tyrod Taylor at halftime of the Giants' Week 16 game against the Philadelphia Eagles after completing nine of 16 passes for only 55 yards as the Giants trailed 20–3. Taylor was later named the starter for the remainder of the season.\nAs the season progressed, DeVito quickly became a fan favorite, as he went from an undrafted third string rookie quarterback to leading an underachieving Giants team to some surprising success. He was given the nickname “Tommy Cutlets” in reference to his Italian heritage and mentioning that he likes to eat his mother's chicken cutlets.\nDevito won the Bud Light Celebration of the Year Award at the 13th Annual NFL Honors.\nPersonal life.\nDue to the close proximity of his parents’ home to the Giants' facilities, DeVito elected to live with them during his rookie season."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Longhorns represent the University of Texas at Austin in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference.\nTexas began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1905. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Texas's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Clark played collegiately for the Wyoming Cowboys where he is considered one of the program's greatest players. He played as an undersized center for the Cowboys and led the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in rebounding in 1965 and 1966. Clark earned first-team All-WAC honors in his final two seasons. Clark finished his collegiate career as the Cowboys' all-time leader in rebounds with 889.\nClark was selected by the Boston Celtics as the 18th overall pick of the 1966 NBA draft. He and his representative wrote a letter to Celtics general manager Red Auerbach asking for a two-year guaranteed deal worth $40,000. Auerbach read the letter aloud before he tore it up while negotiating the contract of fellow Celtics draft pick Jim Barnett, who received a much lower offer. Clark spent the 1966 preseason with the Celtics and was considered a strong contender to make the final roster a month before the season began after he attempted to translate his playing position to a forward. He was cut by the Celtics before the start of the 1966–67 season and ultimately never played a game in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nClark played for the Hartford Capitols of the Eastern Professional Basketball League during the 1966–67 season. He also played professionally in Europe.\nClark was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1974 and the University of Wyoming Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame in 2004."

The Gauchos represent the University of California Santa Barbara in the NCAA's Big West Conference.\nUC Santa Barbara began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1921. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but UC Santa Barbara's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Alternative Baseball, officially Alternative Baseball Organization Inc. (ABO), is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Dallas, Georgia, United States. Providing year-round baseball training, exhibitions, and activities for teens and adults (ages 15+) with autism and other disabilities throughout the United States.\nFounder.\nIn 2016, The idea of Alternative Baseball originated in Dallas, Georgia by Taylor Duncan, a young man on the autism spectrum. Taylor always wanted to play sports growing up, but was often denied opportunities due to the commonly \"low perception\" of what one with autism can and cannot accomplish.  Duncan said as he got older, there were fewer opportunities to play the sport he loved with coaches deeming his disability as a safety issue.  Duncan believed that once younger people with disabilities graduate from high school, opportunities can completely disappeared and believed that there had to be more services not only to play sports but to continue learning life skills. \nWith Duncan's experiences in baseball and softball across the Southeast region, Taylor decided it was time to give those opportunities to other teens and adults just like him to play in a traditional baseball setting free of judgment. Instead it is used focus on physical and social skills growth through hands-on authentic experience in all practices and games. Some of the players have since taken their skills to apply into other areas in life off the baseball diamond, including in the work field as well.\nDetermined to create his own path in 2016, Duncan founded the Alternative Baseball Organization. This is a non-profit developmental program that provides teens and adults with autism and other special needs the opportunity to play real baseball under MLB rules and with real competition. \nRules.\nFor his league to be official Duncan needed players who were at least 15 years old and volunteers willing to make competitive games happen for those without other teams close by. Players can have any or no experience in baseball to participate. The baseball games are played using the original version of the Professional Baseball Rules. Many games are played between 7-9 innings. Players pitch and catch behind the plate in Alternative Baseball. With most of the rules figured out Duncan was still missing one thing, field dimensions.\nDuncan needed a field for practices and games, a field where the basepaths were 90 feet apart and the pitcher’s mound was exactly 60 feet and six inches from home plate. These are the official measurements for the MLB. He needed equipment for his players like helmets and wooden bats. The only adjustment Duncan decided to add was the size of the ball. The ball had to larger and softer to prevent injuries, since this would be a fully player pitch league.\nOne of the more difficult parts of this league would be finding umpires (baseball referee) that would conduct these rules of the ball for this specific league. This tends to be difficult with the strictness of an umpire and how the game should be \"properly play\", although it is only the ball that is switched. Duncan would find Umpire Vanderpoel and offered him $50 a game, while the game was only about 2 hours long. Vanderpoel gave Duncan an answer he didn’t expect. Rather than charge him the usual $50 per umpire, Vanderpoel said he would provide them for free. \nReferences.\nAbdeldaiem, A. (2019, April 12). Sports Illustrated.

        "text": "A basket, sometimes also called pole hole, flying disc entrapment device or disc golf net, is by far the most common type of target used in disc golf. It features a disc-catching basket under a deflection assembly generally made out of chain. Permanent baskets on courses are built on an anchored metal pole, but portable disc golf baskets with foldable mechanisms to facilitate transportation also exist.\nHistory.\nDisc Golf Association's Mach 1 Disc Pole Hole disc golf basket was invented by Ed Headrick. It was the first formal disc golf target to incorporate chains and a basket on a pole, and became the Technical Standards used by the PDGA. Before the advent of the standardized basket, early competing designs existed, including cone baskets and tone poles.\nSpecifications.\nThe highest governing body in disc golf, the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA), classifies baskets into three categories, based upon hierarchical criteria: championship, standard, and basic. These levels of disc golf baskets differ in several ways, including design, size, and color.\nThe PDGA defines baskets as:Basket Targets are constructed with a basket and typically have a deflection assembly above it. Object Targets, like a simple marked post, have an identified target zone but no basket.\nPermanent baskets.\nMost disc golf courses feature permanent baskets, which are bolted to an anchor embedded in the ground with a concrete base. They are secured using a padlock, and can be pulled out for maintenance.\nNon-commercially available baskets.\nArtisanal, custom, DIY, homemade, improvised, jerry-rigged, upcycled, or otherwise non-commercially available baskets are not uncommon in disc golf. They are most often designed and built by private individuals who use them for backyard putting practice. They can also be found on pirate courses, on community courses in areas with limited funding, and on certain military bases.\nThe PDGA deems DIY baskets acceptable for the lowest tier competitions, but recommends submitting a sample basket to the PDGA Technical Standards Working Group (TSWG) for proper target certification.\nDIY baskets can be made from scratch using of wood or metal, or they can be built by combining existing parts, such as tires and chains."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of John Brown Gordon",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of John Brown Gordon is a monument on the grounds of the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The monument, an equestrian statue, honors John Brown Gordon, a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War who later become a politician in post-Reconstruction era Georgia. Designed by Solon Borglum, the statue was dedicated in 1907 to large fanfare. The statue has recently become a figure of controversy over Gordon's racist views and associations with the Confederacy, with some calling for its removal.\nHistory.\nBackground and creation.\nJohn Brown Gordon was a noted Confederate general during the American Civil War who served multiple terms as a Senator from Georgia and as Governor of Georgia in the post-Reconstruction era. He was also generally recognized as the leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia and supported both the institution of slavery as well as the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. Following his death on January 9, 1904, multiple civic leaders in Atlanta began to plan a monument in his honor. On January 19, 1904 (Robert E. Lee Day), a meeting at the Georgia State Capitol of groups including the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the United Confederate Veterans was held where Clement A. Evans proposed creating a statue to honor Gordon. The John B. Gordon Monument Association was formed for this purpose, led by William Lowndes Calhoun as its president. While the association was successful in fundraising, a total of $25,000 had to be secured from the state government in order to complete the project. Solon Borglum (whose brother Gutzon Borglum was the first sculptor to work on the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial) was commissioned to design an equestrian statue of Gordon, which would rest on a pedestal designed by Alexander Campbell Bruce and supplied by the McNeel Marble Works. \nThe statue, Atlanta's only equestrian statue, was dedicated on the grounds of the Georgia State Capitol on May 25, 1907. Evans served as the main orator for the unveiling, while two daughters of Gordon's did the unveiling. During the dedication, Governor Joseph M. Terrell and another speaker called for the erection of additional monuments on the Capitol grounds for Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, and the \"common soldier\", but budgetary issues prevented these plans from coming to fruition. The statue's unveiling attracted many onlookers, and contemporary accounts mention a choir singing \"Dixie\" to loud cheers during the ceremony. The event took place less than a year after the Atlanta Massacre of 1906. In April 1908, a plaster model of the statue was displayed at an art exhibition held by the National Sculpture Society in Baltimore.\nCalls for removal.\nRecently, the statue has come under criticism due to Gordon's stance on race. Following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, a state senator proposed a law forbidding the official recognition of Confederate symbols, including icons such as the Gordon statue. Around the same time, American historian Kenneth W. Noe, speaking with \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\", spoke directly about the Gordon statue and others on the Capitol grounds as symbols of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. In 2019, the government of Georgia passed a law barring the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials. \nIn 2020, during the George Floyd protests in Atlanta, many protesters called for the removal of the statue, prompting a trending hashtag on Twitter, #TEARDOWNGORDON. On June 8, Bob Trammell, the minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, sent a letter to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp asking him to remove the statue of Gordon, saying, \"the statue's nexus to hate in our state is overwhelming\" and \"its presence is both divisive and offensive.\" Protests regarding the statue and others prompted a barricade to be erected around the Capitol grounds. On June 11, a protester was arrested for vandalizing the statue, writing \"tear down\" with chalk on the monument. Following these events, 44 descendants of Gordon sent an open letter to Governor Kemp calling for the removal of the statue from the Capitol grounds, stating that \"the primary purpose of the statue was to celebrate and mythologize the white supremacists of the Confederacy\".\nDesign.\nThe monument consists of a bronze equestrian statue of Gordon resting on a granite pedestal inscribed with his last name on its front. The horse is modeled after Marye, Gordon's warhorse during the Civil War. Gordon is dressed in his Confederate uniform, but is depicted as an elderly man. Attached to both sides of the pedestal are plaques depicting Gordon. One shows Gordon on horseback during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, while the other plaque is a standing portrait of Gordon inscribed with the words \"GOVERNOR PATRIOT SENATOR\" beneath him. A plaque affixed to the rear of the pedestal is inscribed with a history of Gordon's life, from his birth through his military and political career to his death in 1904.\nThe base of the monument measures approximately long, wide, and tall, while the statue measures approximately long, wide, and tall."

He played in the ACBS Asian Under-21 Snooker Championship in 2018 and 2019, the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship and IBSF World Under-18 Snooker Championship also in 2018 and 2019. His only real success came in the 2019 IBSF World Under-18 Snooker Championship, where he reached the final, losing 5–2 to the 13-year old Jiang Jun.\nHis first taste of professional snooker came at the 2019 World Open, where he was a wildcard. Originally Gao's coach Ju Reti had qualified, but gave up his place in order to allow his pupil to gain experience. Gao lost the match 5–1 to Lu Ning.\nIn January 2020 Gao won the WSF Junior Open, an under-18 tournament. He beat heralded juniors Ben Mertens, Dean Young and Wu Yize, before overcoming Sean Maddocks 5–2 in the final. As a result, he was awarded a two-year card on the World Snooker Tour for the 2020–21 and 2021–22. Even though just 15 years old, he stated that he intended to take up his professional tour card. He thus became the second professional snooker player from Anhui, after his mentor Niu Zhuang.\n2020/2021 season.\nAs it happened, Gao turned 16 before the start of the 2020–21 season, which was delayed due to COVID-19. His first tournament was the Championship League. Gao made 2-2 draws against Ben Woollaston and Si Jiahui, but lost 3–1 to Matt Selt. He finished his first day as a professional 3rd in the 4-player group but had made two century breaks.\nIn subsequent tournaments Gao had wins against Zhao Jianbo, Kacper Filipiak, Mitchell Mann and Duane Jones. In the Northern Ireland Open Gao lost 4–0 to World No.1 Judd Trump, who had breaks of 109, 127 and a maximum 147. In the World Championship, Gao beat experienced player Paul Davison 6-3 and played very well against Lyu Haotian to lead 5–3. But his more experienced compatriot won the last 3 frames to edge the match 6–5. Gao finished his debut season ranked 107.\nStyle.\nGao is known as an attacking left-hander. Unusually, he can play with either hand with the rest: with his left-hand he plays underarm in a manner pioneered by the Thai player Sunny Akani.\nPersonal life.\nDuring the season, Gao Yang lives in Sheffield where he practices at the Ding Junhui Snooker Academy."

        "title": "WrestleMania Backlash (2021)",
        "text": "The 2021 WrestleMania Backlash was the 16th Backlash professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on May 16, 2021, from the WWE ThunderDome, hosted at the Yuengling Center in Tampa, Florida. It was WWE's first pay-per-view to present the ThunderDome from the Yuengling Center during the COVID-19 pandemic, following a four-month residency at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. It was also the first Backlash to livestream on Peacock. From 1999 to 2009, the concept of the Backlash pay-per-view was based around the backlash from WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania. The 2021 event returned Backlash to this original position as the post-WrestleMania pay-per-view, and it was in turn renamed to \"WrestleMania Backlash\" as it was based around the backlash from WrestleMania 37.\nSeven matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Cesaro by technical submission to retain SmackDown's Universal Championship. In another prominent match, Bobby Lashley defeated Drew McIntyre and Braun Strowman in a triple threat match to retain Raw's WWE Championship. Also on the undercard, Bianca Belair defeated Bayley to retain the SmackDown Women's Championship and Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio defeated Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, thus becoming the first-ever father and son team to hold a tag team championship in WWE.\nThe event received positive reviews from critics and fans. The event included a promotional tie-in for the zombie film \"Army of the Dead\", which stars former WWE wrestler and WWE Hall of Fame nominee Batista. In addition to Batista doing a voiceover for the event's opening vignette, the Lumberjack match between Damian Priest and The Miz had the lumberjacks acting as zombies. This tie-in was heavily panned and covered in the media, with the \"New York Post\" calling it \"one of WWE's saddest moments ever.\" Despite the negative criticism towards the tie-in, the rest of the event was well-received.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nBacklash is a recurring professional wrestling event that was established by WWE in 1999. It was held annually from 1999 to 2009, but was then discontinued until it was reinstated in 2016 and has been held every year since, except in 2019. The original concept of the event was based around the backlash from WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania, but the events between 2016 and 2020 did not carry this theme. The 2021 Backlash was initially scheduled for June 20, however, during Night 2 of WrestleMania 37, it was revealed that Backlash would take place on May 16 and would be titled \"WrestleMania Backlash\", thus returning the event to its original concept and featuring the backlash from WrestleMania 37. It was the 16th Backlash and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event aired on pay-per-view (PPV) worldwide and was available to livestream on the WWE Network in international markets, and was the first Backlash to livestream on Peacock after the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that began affecting the industry in mid-March 2020, WWE had to present the majority of its programming from a behind closed doors set. Initially, Raw and SmackDown's television shows and pay-pew-views were done at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. A limited number of Performance Center trainees and friends and family members of the wrestlers were later utilized to serve as the live audience. In late August, these programs were moved to a bio-secure bubble called the WWE ThunderDome. The select live audience was no longer utilized as the bubble allowed fans to attend the events virtually for free and be seen on the nearly 1,000 LED boards within the arena. Additionally, the ThunderDome utilized various special effects to further enhance wrestlers' entrances, and arena audio was mixed with that of the chants from the virtual fans. After being hosted at Orlando's Amway Center, the ThunderDome was relocated to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida in December.\nDue to the start of the 2021 Tampa Bay Rays season, as Tropicana Field is the home venue of the Tampa Bay Rays, on March 24, 2021, WWE announced that they would relocate the ThunderDome to the Yuengling Center, located on the campus of the University of South Florida in Tampa, which began with the April 12 episode of \"Raw\". Subsequently, WrestleMania Backlash was the first WWE pay-per-view produced from the ThunderDome at the Yuengling Center.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised seven matches, including one on the pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nOn the April 16 episode of \"SmackDown\", Universal Champion Roman Reigns, along with Paul Heyman and Jey Uso, boasted about retaining his championship in the main event of Night 2 of WrestleMania 37. Reigns was then interrupted by Cesaro, but before he could speak, Reigns, Jey, and Heyman left the ring and departed backstage. Later, Cesaro confronted Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville about facing Reigns that night, even as a non-title match. However, instead of Reigns, Cesaro faced Jey in the main event, which ended by disqualification when Seth Rollins, who Cesaro had defeated at Night 1 of WrestleMania 37, interfered and attacked Cesaro, proclaiming that their rivalry was not over. On the special \"Throwback SmackDown\" on May 7, Cesaro was scheduled to face Rollins with the added stipulation that if Cesaro won, he would earn a Universal Championship match at WrestleMania Backlash. Cesaro defeated Rollins once again, securing the championship match. Also that episode, Jey's brother Jimmy returned from injury, last appearing at Hell in a Cell in October 2020, and although conflicted at first, particularly because of what Reigns did to them at Hell in a Cell, Jimmy also eventually aligned with Reigns, but soon turned on Reigns.\nAt Night 1 of WrestleMania 37, Bobby Lashley defeated Drew McIntyre to retain the WWE Championship. On the following night's \"Raw\", Lashley's manager MVP declared that no one could defeat Lashley. McIntyre interrupted and wanted another opportunity at Lashley, claiming that he would have defeated him if MVP had not distracted him and prevented him from performing the Claymore Kick on Lashley. Braun Strowman and Randy Orton then interrupted and stated their respective cases to challenge for the title. WWE official Adam Pearce then scheduled a triple threat match between McIntyre, Strowman, and Orton with the winner facing Lashley for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania Backlash, which was won by McIntyre. On the April 26 episode, Strowman challenged McIntyre to a match with the added stipulation that if Strowman won, he would be added to the championship match at WrestleMania Backlash. Strowman defeated McIntyre, thus the championship match became a triple threat match.\nIn the main event of Night 1 of WrestleMania 37, Bianca Belair won the SmackDown Women's Championship. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford, the latter of whom is Belair's real-life husband) threw Belair a championship celebration. Later, Bayley challenged Belair for the title. The following week, the championship match was scheduled for WrestleMania Backlash.\nAt Night 2 of WrestleMania 37, Rhea Ripley defeated Asuka to win the Raw Women's Championship. The two had a rematch the following night on \"Raw\", however, the match ended in a no-contest after interference from a returning Charlotte Flair, who attacked Asuka. Prior to the match, Flair, who had been off TV for the past month, returned that night after missing her first WrestleMania since WrestleMania 32 in 2016. The following week, Flair lost to Asuka thanks to a distraction from Ripley. Following the match, an irate Flair attacked the referee. Adam Pearce subsequently suspended Flair, however, fellow WWE official Sonya Deville, who primarily appeared on SmackDown, reinstated Flair the following week after Flair made a public apology on \"Raw\". On the May 3 episode, another rematch between Ripley and Asuka for the Raw Women's Championship was scheduled for WrestleMania Backlash. However, Deville allowed Flair a chance to present a proposal and after hearing Flair's case, Deville added Flair to the championship match to make it a triple threat match.\nAt the special \"WrestleMania Edition\" of \"SmackDown\" on April 9, Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode and The Mysterios (Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio) took part in a fatal four-way tag team match for Ziggler and Roode's SmackDown Tag Team Championship, where the champions retained. On May 7, a title match between the two teams was scheduled for WrestleMania Backlash.\nAt Night 1 of WrestleMania 37, Bad Bunny and Damian Priest defeated The Miz and John Morrison. On the following \"Raw\", The Miz hosted a segment of \"Miz TV\" along with Morrison, which also saw the return of Miz's wife Maryse to WWE programming, who last appeared in December 2019. Miz bragged and claimed that he turned Bad Bunny into a WWE superstar. Priest interrupted and praised Bad Bunny and then challenged Miz and Morrison to a handicap match. Priest lost the match after The Miz pinned him with a roll-up and used the ropes as leverage while Maryse also assisted. Priest then defeated The Miz the following week. On the May 3 episode, Priest defeated Morrison due to an untimely distraction by The Miz. The following week, Priest defeated Morrison to pick the stipulation for his match against The Miz at WrestleMania Backlash, and chose a lumberjack match.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the WrestleMania Backlash Kickoff pre-show, United States Champion Sheamus faced Ricochet in a non-title match. In the end, Sheamus performed a Knee Strike on Ricochet to win the match.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Rhea Ripley defending the Raw Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair and Asuka. In the closing moments, after an evenly competitive match between the three, Ripley performed the Riptide on Asuka to retain the title.\nNext, Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio. Earlier in the night, Dominik was attacked by Ziggler and Roode, and medical personnel ruled Dominik unable to compete. During the match, Ziggler and Roode dominated Rey. About mid-way though, Dominik eventually entered the match. In the end, Rey performed a 619 on Roode and tagged in Dominik, who then performed a Frog Splash on Roode to win the titles, thus becoming the first-ever father and son team to hold a tag team championship in WWE.\nAfter that, Damian Priest faced The Miz (accompanied by John Morrison) in a lumberjack match. The ring was surrounded by zombies as a promotional tie-in for the zombie film \"Army of the Dead\", which stars former WWE wrestler and WWE Hall of Fame nominee Batista. During the match, Priest and Miz teamed to fend off the zombies. In the end, Morrison was \"devoured\" by the zombies which distracted Miz. Priest performed Hit the Lights on Miz to win the match. Following the match, several zombies entered the ring and \"devoured\" Miz.\nIn the next match, Bianca Belair defended the SmackDown Women's Championship against Bayley. Belair pinned Bayley using her braided hair to gain leverage to retain the title.\nIn the penultimate match, Bobby Lashley (accompanied by MVP) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre and Braun Strowman. During the match, Lashley and McIntyre fought their way up the entrance ramp where McIntyre threw Lashley through an LED board. Back in the ring, McIntyre and Strowman continued the match. In the end, as McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Strowman, Lashley appeared, threw McIntyre out of the ring and performed a Spear on Strowman to retain the title.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against Cesaro. Throughout the match, Reigns targeted Cesaro's right arm, thus preventing Cesaro from doing his upper cuts and not being able to fully apply other maneuvers. In the climax, Reigns applied the Guillotine Choke submission on Cesaro, who passed out, thus Reigns retained the title via technical submission. After the match, Cesaro was attacked by Jey Uso. Seth Rollins then came out. After a stare down with Reigns, Rollins viciously attacked Cesaro and smashed his right arm in a steel chair.\nReception.\nThe event received mixed to positive reviews. While most of the pay-per-view was well received, the marketing tie-in with \"Army of the Dead\" during the Damian Priest vs. The Miz Lumberjack match was heavily panned. The film's star and former WWE wrestler Batista responded to fan criticism, stating that he did not book \"a bunch of fucking zombies\", and that fans should be calling out WWE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Vince McMahon for the decision. A review from \"Shacknews\" said that WrestleMania Backlash exceeded \"almost every expectation,\" except for the Lumberjack match. The review said that the match was already bad, but it was made worse by the inclusion of the zombies, with Priest and Miz having to act like they were actually scared of them. The negative criticism over the tie-in was covered by mainstream media outlet \"New York Post\", calling it \"one of WWE's saddest moments ever\". They were positive about the rest of the show. The match between Priest and Miz was voted as the Worst Match of the Year by readers of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\". Despite the negative criticism towards the zombies, WWE made over US$1 million from Warner Bros. for the promotional tie-in.\nAftermath.\n\"WrestleMania Backlash\" would also be used as the title of the 2022 event, however, the 2023 event reverted the event to the original \"Backlash\" title.\nRaw.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", WWE Champion Bobby Lashley issued an open challenge. Drew McIntyre came out to accept as he was not pinned in the triple threat match, however, MVP stated that it was open to anyone except McIntyre and Braun Strowman—WrestleMania Backlash would in turn be Strowman's final appearance in WWE until he returned on the September 5, 2022, episode of \"Raw\", as he was released from his contract on June 2. In the main event of \"Raw\", it was revealed that the open challenge was just to face Lashley rather than a title match. The New Day's Kofi Kingston answered the challenge and defeated Lashley thanks to McIntyre's distraction. The following week, WWE official Adam Pearce scheduled a match between McIntyre and Kingston where the winner would face Lashley for the WWE Championship at Hell in a Cell, only for it to end in a no-contest after interference from Lashley and MVP. A rematch was scheduled for the May 31 episode where if Lashley and/or MVP were at ringside or interfered in the match, Lashley would be suspended for 90 days without pay; McIntyre defeated Kingston to earn another title match against Lashley at Hell in a Cell. On the June 7 episode, during the contract signing for the match, the match was stipulated as a Hell in a Cell match, and that this would be McIntyre's last chance at the title as long as Lashley was the champion.\nAlso on \"Raw\", Charlotte Flair confronted WWE officials Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville, demanding another opportunity at Rhea Ripley for the Raw Women's Championship as Flair did not take the pin in the triple threat match. Pearce and Deville stated that if Flair won her match against Asuka, they would consider it. However, Flair lost the match thanks to a distraction from Ripley. A rematch occurred the following week, where Flair defeated Asuka, thus earning another title match against Ripley at Hell in a Cell.\nAlso on \"Raw\", United States Champion Sheamus faced Ricochet in a non-title rematch. Sheamus again defeated Ricochet.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following \"SmackDown\", WWE official Sonya Deville announced that WWE would be leaving the ThunderDome and returning to live touring, starting with the July 16 episode of \"SmackDown\". She also hosted a parade of champions to celebrate SmackDown's champions. New SmackDown Tag Team Champions Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio, SmackDown Women's Champion Bianca Belair, Intercontinental Champion Apollo Crews (accompanied by Commander Azeez), and WWE Women's Tag Team Champions Natalya and Tamina were all on stage. Deville then introduced Universal Champion Roman Reigns, however, Paul Heyman instead came out, stating that everyone else were just title holders and that Reigns was the only real champion. Bayley then interrupted, claiming that Belair cheated at WrestleMania Backlash by using her hair. Belair and Bayley were scheduled for a rematch at Hell in a Cell, which was later stipulated as a Hell in a Cell match.\nAlso on the following \"SmackDown\", Cesaro, with his arm in a sling, confronted Universal Champion Roman Reigns and challenged him to another match at Hell in a Cell. However, Seth Rollins attacked Cesaro again, resulting in medical personnel taking Cesaro out on a stretcher. A match between Cesaro and Rollins was later scheduled for Hell in a Cell.\nAlso on \"SmackDown\". Dominik Mysterio defeated Robert Roode in a singles match. Later that night, The Mysterios (Dominik and Rey Mysterio) were scheduled to defend the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against Roode and Dolph Ziggler the following week. Prior to their match, Rey was attacked backstage, similar to what happened at WrestleMania Backlash, leaving Dominik to face Ziggler and Roode alone. At the climax of the match, Rey made his way to the ring, which distracted Roode and allowed Dominik to pin him to retain the titles. After a successful, albeit controversial, title defense against The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) on the June 4 episode, which ended after interference from Roman Reigns, who brutally attacked Dominik, the Mysterios then entered into a feud with Reigns and The Usos, resulting in Rey challenging Reigns for the Universal Championship."

        "title": "Hargrave Military Academy basketball",
        "text": "The Hargrave Military Academy basketball team is the prep basketball team of Hargrave Military Academy. The Tigers have won three National Prep Championships since a formal tournament began in the mid 2000s. The program has produced hundreds of players that went on to play NCAA Division 1 basketball, and 27 that have gone on to play in the NBA. The program has also been a breeding ground for college coaches, as many former head coaches and assistants have ascended through the ranks at the NCAA Division 1 level. The Hargrave Military Academy basketball program was named “Program of the Decade” by RealGM in 2012 after a study showing that Hargrave produced more successful college basketball players than any other prep school or high school in the nation. The program was also featured on a season 2 episode of CNN's Inside Man.\nTeam history.\nThe Scott Shepard years (94-99).\nShepard manned the sidelines for the Tigers from the 1994-95 season to the 1998–99 season. He compiled an overall record of 127-18, and had multiple teams ranked in the top 3 nationally. He sent over fifty players on to Division 1 schools in his time. Shepard moved on from Hargrave to accept a position as an assistant coach with the Virginia Cavaliers for the 1999-2000 season.\nThe Kevin Keatts years (99-01;03-11).\nUpon Shepherd's departure to the University of Virginia, Kevin Keatts was promoted from an assistant to head coach prior to the 1999-2000 season. Keatts would man the sidelines for the Tigers for the 99-00 and 00-01 seasons before accepting an assistant coaching position at Marshall. He returned to Hargrave for the 2003-2004 season, and was in charge of the Tigers for the better part of the decade from that point forward. He coached the Tigers to their first two National Prep Championships, as well as the program's first undefeated season in 2008. During his time, he sent 103 players on to the NCAA Division 1 level, and coached 16 players that reached the NBA level. He owns a career win-loss record at Hargrave of 262-17. Keatts would leave Hargrave in 2011 to accept a position as an assistant coach on Rick Pitino's Louisville staff.\nThe A.W. Hamilton years (11-17).\nA longtime assistant to Kevin Keatts, A.W. Hamilton was selected to lead the program when Keatts departed. Hamilton presided over the Tigers during one of the most successful stretches in the history of the program. His 6-year run included 237 wins with just 22 losses, with 63 of his players continuing on to the NCAA Division 1 level. He also had two former players, and fellow Hargrave All-Decade Team selections, Montrezl Harrell and Terry Rozier, selected in the 2015 NBA Draft. Hamilton was lauded as the National Prep Coach of the Year twice (2012,2016) and East Regional Coach of the Year three times (2014, 2015, 2017) during his tenure. He guided players that set records for career points and points scored in a game and his 2016 National Championship team set a school record for wins in a season with 47. Hamilton had a home record of 120-2 during his six years at the helm. Hamilton accepted a position as an assistant coach at N.C. State, reuniting with Kevin Keatts, in 2017.\nThe Lee Martin years (17-20).\nLee Martin had been the associate head coach for A.W. Hamilton from 2015-2017 and was hired as his replacement when the former departed for N.C. State. Martin continued the winning tradition at Hargrave, to the tune of a 113-12 overall record in his three seasons as head coach. Martin's teams advanced to the National Tournament every year of his tenure, including an Elite 8 appearance in 2019 and a Final Four appearance in 2020. Under his watch, Hargrave broke the school record for points in a single game with 173 points scored on March 1, 2019. Martin's teams finished in the top 4 of the final national poll each year of his tenure. In his three years as Head Coach, 26 of his players went on to the Division 1 level. On June 25, 2020, Martin accepted a position as an assistant coach on Jeff Boals' staff at Ohio.\nThe Thomas Messinger years (20-23).\nThomas Messinger was hired as head coach in June 2020 after a 3-year stint as the associate head coach for Lee Martin. Messinger served as an assistant coach under Hamilton (15-17) before that. As an assistant at Hargrave, his record was 203-15. Messinger led the Tigers to a 33-1 record in his first year at the helm during the 2020-2021 season, and a 37-5 record in his second year during the 2021-22 season. Both seasons saw the Tigers end the season ranked in the top 4 nationally (#2 in 2021, #4 in 2022). Messinger was named South Region Coach of the Year for the 2021-22 season. Over his first two seasons, 18 players from Hargrave signed NCAA Division 1 scholarships. In his third season, Hargrave ended the season ranked #1 nationally with a 44-2 overall record, which included winning the inaugural Elite Prep League regular season and conference championships. Messinger also became the fastest coach to 100 career wins in Hargrave's storied history (106 games, during his third season) on January 28, 2023. Messinger was named National Postgrad Coach of the Year, as well as Elite Prep League Coach of the Year for the 2022-23 season. His overall record as head coach stands at 114-8 (.934 winning percentage) through three seasons. In May 2023, Messinger accepted a position as an Assistant Coach at NJIT under Grant Billmeier."
