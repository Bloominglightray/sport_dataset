        "text": "Tony La Russa Baseball is a baseball computer and video game console sports game series (1991-1997), designed by Don Daglow, Michael Breen, Mark Buchignani, David Bunnett and Hudson Piehl and developed by Stormfront Studios. The game appeared on Commodore 64, PC, and Sega Genesis, and different versions were published by Electronic Arts, SSI and Stormfront Studios. The artificial intelligence for the computer manager was provided by Tony La Russa, then manager of the Oakland Athletics and later the St. Louis Cardinals. The game was one of the best-selling baseball franchises of the 1990s.\nThe game was based on the baseball simulation methods Daglow evolved through the \"Baseball\" mainframe computer game (1971) (the first computer baseball game ever written), \"Intellivision World Series Baseball\" (1983) and \"Earl Weaver Baseball\" (1987).\n\"TLB\" refined many of the simulation elements of \"Earl Weaver Baseball\", and introduced a few \"firsts\" of its own:\nThe first version of \"La Russa\", \"Tony La Russa's Ultimate Baseball\", was released almost exactly twenty years after the first playable version of \"Baseball\" went live at Pomona College in 1971.\nReception.\n\"Computer Gaming World\" in 1993 stated that \"Tony La Russa Baseball 2\" was especially strong in league play. Although citing several bugs and stating that the action game \"is not as clean as it should be\", the magazine concluded that \"this is quite simply the \"best\" baseball game on the market\".\nA reviewer for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave \"La Russa Baseball '95\" a 70%, commenting that \"The controls for the pitcher and the batter need some work. Animations of players are neat, but they slow down a bit. An okay revision from last year.\"\nIn 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" declared \"Tony La Russa Baseball 3\" the 128th-best computer game ever released."

The few genera contain fewer than 100 species. Ant crickets are yellow, brown, or nearly black in color. They do not produce sound, and lack both wings and tympanal organs (\"ears\") on the front tibia. \nSpecies of the subfamily Bothriophylacinae live in caves and the burrows of desert vertebrates rather than ant nests. The three extant ant cricket genera (subfamily Myrmecophilinae) are obligate kleptoparasites of ants.

        "title": "Cycling glove",
        "text": "Cycling gloves are gloves designed for cycling. They may provide warmth, comfort and protection.\nBasic functionality.\nWarmth.\nGloves are frequently used to keep the hands warm, a function that is particularly necessary when cycling in cold weather. The design of most modern bicycles is such that the rider's hands remain on the handlebars while cycling, a position that leaves them exposed to weather. The hands are also relatively inactive, and do not have a great deal of muscle mass, which also contributes to the possibility of chill. Gloves are therefore vital for insulating the hands from cold, wind, and evaporative cooling while riding a bicycle.\nGrip.\nIn warm weather, sweat from cyclists' hands can cause difficulty maintaining control over the bicycle by making handlebars slippery and difficult to hold without increased hand tension (which can cause further issues and numbness). Cycling gloves, some designed without full finger covering and with ventilation to reduce temperature (the opposite intention of cold weather gloves) are used to increase grip and prevent sweat from making handlebars slippery. \nComfort.\nCycling places a good deal of stress on the hands, in the form of prolonged pressure against handlebars and transmission of sudden road shocks through handlebars to the hands. The severity of discomfort can be mitigated somewhat by riding position, but is essentially inherent in most designs of upright bicycle. However, choice of weight distribution between the saddle and handlebars is usually determined by other factors, such as aerodynamics, control and long-term comfort. Padded gloves or handlebar grips are therefore useful to increase comfort for a given geometry.\nHowever, excess padding can lead to other problems. Normally the hands will rest on the bones in the heel of the hand - too much padding will tend to press on the soft tissues between these and can compress the nerves in the hands, causing something akin to carpal tunnel syndrome.\nFace and nose wiping.\nCyclists often deal with perspiration and nose running on a constant basis. Because clothes and paper tissues may be difficult and time-consuming to use during cycling, many cyclists have resorted to using the backs of their gloves to wipe the sweat from their faces and the nasal mucus that drips from their noses. Many modern cycling gloves come with a built in \"nose wipe\" on the back of the hand, typically on the thumb or forefinger or both. Aftermarket fabric nose wipes that slip onto the back of the hand or wrist of the glove are also preferred by some cyclists.\nProtection.\nPutting a hand out to break a fall is a natural reaction. However, the hands are one of the more difficult parts of the body to repair. There is little or no spare skin, and immobilising the hands sufficiently to promote healing involves significant inconvenience to the patient. So, many cyclists choose to wear gloves all year round to help avoid skin damage in a fall.\nCare of gloves.\nSweat from hands can make one's gloves become unpleasant quite quickly, so it is best to store them so that air can circulate inside if at all possible (for example on a radiator). After a wet or hard ride it may be best to turn them inside-out to dry. Leather gloves can be washed in cool water and are reportedly best dried out on the hands."

(As of 2023)\nOne off matches.\nThe matches in 1980 and 1981 were one off experimental matches after New South Wales had already won the interstate series in both years. Both games count toward official statistics, but are not considered series.\nAfter Queensland had won the 1987 State of Origin series 2–1, a further game was played in Long Beach, California to showcase rugby league to the American public. On 15 July 2003 the Australian Rugby League announced that this game was to be classified as an \"official match\" and that the match would count towards the players' individual statistics and overall match win–loss–draw records. However, the match does not count towards the series win–loss–draw record and the 1987 series still remains a 2–1 win to Queensland.\nSuper League.\nNew South Wales and Queensland played two matches against each other under State of Origin selection rules using players from the Super League (Australia) competition. These matches were not sanctioned by the Australian Rugby League and are not counted as official State of Origin series matches. The Tri-series also included both sides playing a game against New Zealand.\nStatistics.\nGrounds.\nSince 1988 either New South Wales or Queensland usually hosts two of the three matches on a rotational basis. Prior to this Queensland hosted two matches every year. In 1990, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2006, 2009, 2012, 2015 and 2018 one of the matches was played in Melbourne.

        "text": "Kevin Campion (born 18 September 1971) is a former Ireland international rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. A Queensland State of Origin representative forward, he also played for Ireland in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. Campion played his club football in Australia for Gold Coast Seagulls, St. George Dragons, Adelaide Rams, Brisbane Broncos, New Zealand Warriors and North Queensland Cowboys.\nBackground.\nCampion was born in Sarina, Queensland, Australila.\nKevin is the younger brother of Australian radio personality Paul Campion. His younger brother Neil Campion was a coach at Aspley Junior Rugby League club.\nCareer.\nCampion is one of three State of Origin representative products from Sarina State High School (along with Dale Shearer and Wendell Sailor), and one of four from the Sarina Crocodiles (along with Shearer, Sailor and Martin Bella).\nCampion made his début for the Gold Coast Seagulls in 1993, and went on to play 44 games for the club before signing with St. George for the 1996 season. He played in the in the Dragons' 8–20 loss to Manly in the Grand Final at the Sydney Football Stadium. It would be his last game for St. George as he had signed to play for the Adelaide Rams in the new Super League competition in 1997.\nAfter joining the Rams, Campion was one of the team's stand-out players in the club's first season. He would make his representative début for Queensland during the 1997 Super League Tri-series that year but sensationally was told by Rams coach Rod Reddy that he was not part of his plans for the club in 1998.\nAfter leaving Adelaide, Kevin Campion was snapped up by Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett, and \nwent on to play 80 games for the club between 1998 and 2000, including the 1998 and 2000 NRL Grand Finals. He scored a try for Brisbane in their 38–12 win over the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in the 1998 decider.\nCampion then signed with the New Zealand Warriors in 2001 and went on to play at lock forward in their 2002 NRL Grand Final loss to the Sydney Roosters. At half-time in that match, coach Daniel Anderson (rugby league) attempted to inspire the team by playing a mock commentary track of the Warriors scoring \"the greatest try ever scored\". Campion picked up the tape recorder, smashed it on the ground and gave the team an inspired speech instead.\nThis appearance made Campion one of only five players who have played in Grand Finals for three clubs during his career.\nCampion also represented Queensland on six occasions: four times in the annual State of Origin series, and twice in the Super League Tri-series. He also helped Ireland to the quarter-finals in the 2000 World Cup. Whilst at the New Zealand Warriors, Campion was co-captain with New Zealand international halfback Stacey Jones.\nRetirement.\nCampion retired at the end of National Rugby League season 2004 with 241 first grade games. During the 2005 season he was involved in coaching with the New Zealand Warriors but has since returned to Gold Coast."

        "text": "Stephen John Lyons (born June 3, 1960) is an American former professional baseball player who previously worked as a television sportscaster for the New England Sports Network (NESN). He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for four teams over a period of nine seasons (1985–1993), including four stints with the Boston Red Sox. He was initially an outfielder and third baseman, but found a niche as a utility player. After his retirement as a player, he became a television baseball commentator. In 2021, NESN announced Lyons would not be returning to his in-studio pre- and post-game analyst role.\nEarly years.\nLyons was born in 1960 in Tacoma, Washington, and grew up in Eugene and Beaverton, Oregon. His father, Richard Lyons, was a star athlete at Hudson High School in Massachusetts, who encouraged him to play baseball. He attended Marist Catholic High School in Eugene, before graduating from Beaverton High School in 1978. He attended Oregon State on a partial baseball scholarship. After his junior year, Lyons was a first round draft pick (19th overall) by the Boston Red Sox in the 1981 MLB draft; he left Oregon State without graduating, to begin his baseball career.\nPlaying career.\nPath to the majors.\nAt the start of his professional career, Lyons played for four teams in Boston's farm system: the Class A Winston-Salem Red Sox in 1981, the Double-A Bristol Red Sox in 1982, the Double-A New Britain Red Sox in 1983, and the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox in 1984. He had a .248 batting average while hitting 43 home runs and 222 RBIs in 462 minor league games.\nBoston Red Sox.\nAfter playing for years in the minor leagues, Lyons was promoted to the Red Sox in 1985, due in large part to having an impressive spring training; in addition to hitting well, his speed on the bases, and his ability to play a number of positions contributed to the decision. Lyons made his major league debut with the Red Sox on April 15, as a pinch runner at age 24. He collected his first major league hit on April 30, off of Donnie Moore of the California Angels. Starting in early June, Lyons became Boston's regular center fielder; he went on to play 133 games with the 1985 Red Sox, batting .264 with five home runs and 30 RBIs.\nIn 1986, Lyons appeared in 59 games through late June, batting .250 with one home run and 14 RBIs. On May 10, he was ejected for the only time in his MLB career, by umpire Terry Cooney after arguing a called third strike.\nChicago White Sox.\nLyons was traded to the Chicago White Sox for pitcher Tom Seaver on June 29, 1986. For the remainder of the 1986 season, Lyons played 42 games with the White Sox, batting .203 with six RBIs; he also played 20 games with the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. During 1987, Lyons split time between Chicago and their Triple-A affiliate, the Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League. With the White Sox, he batted .280 with one home run and 19 RBIs in 76 games.\nLyons spent all of the 1988 season with Chicago, batting .269 with five home runs and 45 RBIs in 146 games. In 1989, he appeared in 140 games, batting .264 with two home runs and 50 RBIs. He played 94 games in 1990, batting .192 with one home run and 11 RBIs. In parts of five seasons with the White Sox, Lyons appeared in 497 games, batting .255 with nine home runs and 131 RBIs. Lyons was released by the White Sox on April 13, 1991.\nPlaying every position.\nLyons played every defensive position (including pitcher) as well as designated hitter, pinch hitter, and pinch runner during his time with the White Sox. He also has the rare distinction of having played all nine defensive positions in a single game at the major league level, although in an exhibition contest. The \"Windy City Classic,\" between the Chicago Cubs and the White Sox, took place at Wrigley Field on April 23, 1990. Per standard baseball notation, Lyons's positions during the game were, in order: 2-3-7-8-6-9-5-9-1-4.\nSecond stint with Boston.\nLyons signed with Boston on April 18, 1991. With the 1991 Red Sox he played in 87 games, batting .241 with four home runs and 17 RBIs. After the season, Lyons became a free agent.\nAtlanta Braves.\nLyons signed with the Atlanta Braves in January 1992. He played 11 games for them, batting 1-for-14 (.071) with one RBI. The Braves released him at the end of April.\nMontreal Expos.\nLyons signed with the Montreal Expos on May 8, 1992. He played 16 games for them, batting 3-for-13 (.231) with one RBI.\nThird stint with Boston.\nThe Expos sold Lyons to the Red Sox on June 27, 1992. Through the end of the season, Lyons played 21 games for Boston, batting 7-for-28 (.250) with two RBIs. He also played 37 games with Triple-A Pawtucket. After the season, Lyons again became a free agent.\nLyons signed with the Chicago Cubs in early February 1993, and was released in late March.\nFourth stint with Boston.\nLyons again signed with Boston on May 7, 1993. With the 1993 Red Sox he appeared in 28 games, batting 3-for-23 (.130). He also appeared in 67 Triple-A games with Pawtucket. Lyons's final MLB game was on October 3, when he played right field and second base in a 14-inning loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. He became a free agent after the season, but did not continue his playing career. In parts of five seasons with the Red Sox, Lyons played in 328 games, batting .251 with 10 home runs and 63 RBIs.\nLyons's overall MLB career totals include a .252 batting average, 19 home runs, and 196 RBIs in 853 games. He appeared twice as a relief pitcher, giving up four hits and one run in three innings pitched for a 3.00 ERA, while walking four and striking out two.\nEccentricities.\nLyons's colorful personality earned him the nickname \"Psycho\". He was known for such eccentricities as playing tic-tac-toe and hangman against opposing players during games, using spikes to mark the infield dirt.\nHis most remembered incident occurred at Tiger Stadium in Detroit on a Monday night in 1990. In a televised game played on July 16, he created a stir that was replayed countless times. After sliding headfirst into first base to beat out a bunt hit, Lyons pulled down his pants to empty the dirt out and brush off his shirttail. After a few seconds (and a reaction from the crowd of over 14,000), he realized what he had just done and quickly pulled them up, humorously embarrassed. Although wearing sliding shorts under his White Sox uniform, this incident earned him another nickname, \"Moon Man\" Lyons. At the end of the inning, women in the stands waved dollar bills at him as he came to the dugout.\nAnd the jokes began, \"No one had ever dropped his drawers on the field. Not Wally Moon. Not Blue Moon Odom. Not even Heinie Manush.\" wrote one columnist. Within 24 hours of the \"exposure,\" he received more exposure than he'd gotten his entire career; seven live television and approximately 20 radio interviews. Lyons himself once stated, \"We've got this pitcher, Mélido Pérez, who earlier this month pitched a no-hitter, and I'll guarantee you he didn't do two live television shots afterward. I pull my pants down, and I do seven. Something's pretty skewed toward the zany in this game.\" In a later interview, Lyons said that, in the moment of dropping his pants, \"I just brain-cramped.\"\nBroadcasting career.\nFox Sports.\nAfter his retirement from the playing field, Lyons became a color analyst for Fox Sports' MLB coverage in 1996, working first in a studio pregame show with Chip Caray and Keith Olbermann, and later on game coverage, usually with Thom Brennaman. He called several Division Series and League Championship Series telecasts for the network. Lyons also served as an anchor for \"Fox Sports News\" (later renamed the \"National Sports Report\"), Fox's ill-fated national sports news show and rival to \"SportsCenter\".\nFox firing.\nDuring their broadcast of Game 3 of the 2006 American League Championship Series (ALCS), broadcast colleague Lou Piniella, who is of Spanish descent, used an analogy about finding a wallet, and then spoke briefly in Spanish. Lyons said Piniella was \"hablaing Español\" – Spanglish for \"speaking Spanish\" – and added, \"I still can't find my wallet. I don't understand him, and I don't want to sit close to him now.\" On October 13, 2006, Fox fired Lyons for making the remarks. Lyons was replaced for the last game of the series in Detroit by Los Angeles Angels announcer José Mota. Piniella later stated that he thought that Lyons was just \"kidding\" and that Lyons was, per Piniella's experience, not bigoted.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nFrom 2005 to 2013, Lyons served as color analyst for the Los Angeles Dodgers on Prime Ticket and KCAL on television broadcasts originating from outside the NL West, broadcasting first alongside Charley Steiner and then Eric Collins. He also co-hosted the Dodgers pre-game and post-game shows for Prime Ticket.\nFollowing Lyons's firing by Fox during the 2006 ALCS, on October 16, 2006, the Dodgers announced that they would keep Lyons as a commentator for their road games. The team said that they gave Lyons probationary guidelines and that he would undergo diversity training. Lyons also continued to host the Dodgers' post-game show, \"Dodgers Live\".\nOn October 12, 2013, Lyons announced that he would not be returning to the Dodgers the following season.\nBoston Red Sox.\nIn 2014, Lyons joined the New England Sports Network (NESN) as a studio analyst and occasional game analyst for NESN's coverage of the Red Sox.\nIn 2017, Lyons took a leave of absence, starting in June, from his broadcasting job with NESN. In August, it became public that Lyons had been arrested for domestic battery in January, with the arresting officer reporting that Lyons's girlfriend had suffered facial injuries. On August 15, 2017, the three misdemeanor charges against Lyons were dropped in superior court in Torrance, California, after it was determined that the photos taken of Lyons's girlfriend in January had been lost by the police, leading to the dismissal. Lyons's leave of absence extended through the remainder of the 2017 MLB season.\nLyons returned to NESN for the 2018 MLB season, calling Red Sox spring training games with Dave O'Brien, and during the regular season has served as an in-studio analyst and fill-in color commentator. Lyons was not brought back for the 2021 Season and beyond.\nOther broadcasting.\nIn the mid-1990s, Lyons worked for WMVP in Chicago, and as an analyst for ESPN and ESPN2. He was part of the Arizona Diamondbacks' broadcast crew in 2003 and 2004. Lyons made his debut video game appearance as a broadcaster in \"All-Star Baseball 2005\" along with Thom Brennaman. He has also been a broadcaster in the \"\" series.\nControversial broadcasting remarks.\nLyons has been criticized for making insensitive comments in the broadcast booth on multiple occasions.\nLyons maligned outfielder Shawn Green, who is Jewish, for sitting out a game on Yom Kippur in 2004, saying, \"He's not even a practicing Jew. He didn't marry a Jewish girl. And from what I understand, he never had a bar mitzvah, which is unfortunate, because he doesn't get the money.\" Lyons was suspended briefly without pay after his remarks, and the network apologized for Lyons's comments, although Lyons never made an on-air apology.\nIn August 2006, while working an Angels-Yankees game, Lyons discussed Italian American Yankees' catcher Sal Fasano, and the fact that he had to shave his mustache to accommodate owner George Steinbrenner's grooming code. Responding to a comment by his fellow Fox sportscaster about how one doesn't want to cross Fasano, Lyons replied, \"Well, you know, Fasano is the type of guy 'who knows a guy that knows a guy'.\"\nLyons and fellow sportscaster Thom Brennaman made fun of a 64-year-old New York Mets fan wearing an unusual device over his eyes at a game during Game 2 of the 2006 National League Division Series between the Mets and Dodgers, with Lyons saying, \"He's got a digital camera stuck to his face.\" The man turned out to be nearly blind, except for limited peripheral vision in one eye, and he was wearing a JORDY, a magnifying device that helped him to see the game. Brennaman later apologized to the man and his family on-air during Game 3 of the series.\nPersonal life.\nLyons is of French and Irish descent, and resides in Hermosa Beach, California. In 1995, he published a book, \"PSYCHOanalysis\", with foreword by Stephen King, of his personal observations and stories about baseball.\nExternal links.\n, or Baseball-Almanac"

        "text": "James Francis Xavier O'Brien (born February 11, 1952) is an American basketball coach who is currently senior advisor for the Philadelphia 76ers. O'Brien was previously an assistant and head coach at both the college and NBA levels and was head coach at Wheeling Jesuit from 1982 to 1987, Dayton from 1989 to 1994, the Boston Celtics from 2001 to 2004, Philadelphia 76ers in 2004–05, and Indiana Pacers from 2007 to 2011.\nEarly life and education.\nO'Brien is the son-in-law of Hall of Fame coach Jack Ramsay. Born and raised in Philadelphia, O'Brien graduated from Roman Catholic High School of Philadelphia in 1970 and St. Joseph's University in 1974. At St. Joseph's, O'Brien started on the Hawks basketball team for three seasons. He earned an M.B.A. from the University of Maryland in 1981.\nCoaching career.\nO'Brien was also head coach at Wheeling Jesuit University from 1982 to 1987 and the University of Dayton from 1989 to 1994. He led the Dayton Flyers to the second round of the NCAA tournament in his first season, after winning the Midwestern Collegiate Conference; however he led the Flyers to just 10 wins in his last two seasons at the school and was fired after the 1993–1994 season. O'Brien then served as an assistant coach to Rick Pitino at the University of Kentucky from 1994 to 1997 and then with the Boston Celtics from 1997 to 2001.\nO'Brien was the head coach of the Boston Celtics from 2001–2004, replacing Rick Pitino. He worked to rebuild the struggling Celtics and led them twice to the playoffs. During the 2003–04 NBA season, however, O'Brien consistently fought with Celtics' general manager Danny Ainge over short-term versus long-term goals. Ainge was looking to completely redo the roster, and traded Eric Williams and Tony Battie, two of O'Brien's favorite hardworking players in December 2003. As a result of the conflict, O'Brien shocked everyone in the Celtics community by resigning in January 2004.\nHe was hired as head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers during the 2004–05 season. The 76ers made the playoffs in his one season as coach after missing the postseason the previous year, and although O'Brien had a multiyear contract, he was fired. Billy King hired Maurice Cheeks as head coach after Cheeks was fired by the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\"The Indianapolis Star\" reported on May 31, 2007, that he would coach the Indiana Pacers. He replaced Rick Carlisle, who was fired after four years, when the team failed in 2006–07 to make the playoffs for the first time in a decade. On January 31, 2011, Pacers President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird relieved O'Brien of his coaching duties. He was replaced by assistant Frank Vogel on an interim basis, who remained as the Pacers' head coach until the 2015–16 season.\nIn the season, O'Brien was an assistant coach for the Dallas Mavericks. After the season, O'Brien retired from the team to spend more time with family.\nIn 2016, O'Brien was hired by the Philadelphia 76ers as an assistant coach to Brett Brown.\nBroadcasting career.\nO'Brien was also an analyst for ESPN's NBA coverage from 2005 to 2007.\nPersonal life.\nO'Brien's son, Jack O'Brien, is a noted internet comedian and podcast host."

        "title": "Finland men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Finland men's national basketball team (, ) represents Finland in international basketball competition. The national team is governed by Basketball Finland.\nFinland has played in 17 EuroBasket tournaments, with their best finish coming in sixth place at EuroBasket 1967, on home soil. Finland has appeared at the Olympic Games twice, in 1952 as hosts, and 1964. Finland has also qualified for the FIBA World Cup twice, in 2014 and 2023.\nSince 2011, Finland has had the highest FIBA World Ranking among Nordic countries.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Finnish Basketball Association was founded in February 1939. A few months earlier the Finnish Football Federation had decided to add basketball to its own repertoire.\nFinland first competed at the European championship at its third installment, the EuroBasket 1939. In the round-robin, they initially struggled and lost to each of the other seven teams and finished with a 70–541 overall point differential.\n1950s.\nFinland's next European competition was 12 years later, at the EuroBasket 1951 in Paris. Overall, they fared much better and split their four preliminary round games and finished at third place in the group at 2–2 but were eliminated from championship contention. They had success after that, winning all three of their classification round 1 games and both round 2 games to finish in 9th place of the 18 teams.\nIn 1952, by virtue of hosting the games in Helsinki, Finland played at the Summer Olympics for the first time. The national team finished at the bottom of Group B in the preliminary round losing all of its game to the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Mexico, and failing to advance.\nFinland used this international experience when they competed again at the EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow. In the preliminary round, they finished with 1 win and 3 losses for 4th place of the 5 teams in the group. They fared significantly better in the first classification round, winning 3 and losing only 1 to finish in the middle of a three-way tie in the group. They lost both the 9–12 and 11/12 classification games, however, taking 12th place of 17 overall.\nAt the next event, Finland had some difficulty in the preliminary round of EuroBasket 1955. They lost all three early games in Budapest and were relegated to the classification round. Once again, not faced with the world elite opponents anymore, the Fins shone in the classification round and won all four of the pool play games. They won their classification 9–12 match as well, but lost to France in the 9/10 final to finish 10th of 18 in the tournament.\nIn Sofia, at the EuroBasket 1957, the Finns finished third in their preliminary group after going 1–2. They moved to the 9–16 classification pool and won five games there with only one loss. They took 11th place overall in the tournament.\nModern era.\nAt the EuroBasket 1995 in Greece, was Finland's first qualification to the top European basketball tournament since 1977. The national team did not fair too well at the event though. As they were routed in their first match against Russia 126–74, and ultimately led to them finishing with an 0–6 record (13th place) and were eliminated.\nFinland qualified for the EuroBasket 2011. The tournament berth was the first for Finland in 16 years. There they finished third out of six teams in EuroBasket 2011 Group C and defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 92–64 and Montenegro 71–65. This allowed them to they qualify for the EuroBasket 2011 Group F. In their first match they were easily defeated by Russia but afterwards they defeated Georgia, before losing to Slovenia in their final match of the tournament. Despite not making it to the best of 8 tournament, Finland ended up making it to their first ever FIBA World Cup as a wild card team alongside Greece, Turkey, and Brazil.\nTeam.\nCurrent

The attachment has a maximum length of 7 cm (2.8\"), not counting the strap or metal ring at the end of the stick where it will be fastened.\nElements.\nRhythmic gymnastics routines require the ribbon to constantly be in motion. Compulsory elements for the ribbon include flicks, circles, snakes and spirals, and throws. It requires a high degree of coordination to form the spirals and circles as any knots which may accidentally form in the ribbon are penalised. During a ribbon routine, large, smooth and flowing movements are looked for."

The rope may be made of hemp or synthetic material which retains the qualities of lightness and suppleness. Its length is in proportion to the size of the gymnast. The rope should, when held down by the feet, reach both of the gymnasts' armpits. At the ends, there may be one or two knots and an anti-slip material to help the gymnast hold on. The rope may or may not be colored, but bright colors are preferred. \nThe fundamental requirements of a rope routine include leaps and skipping. Other elements include swinging and throwing the rope in different directions."

        "text": "Anthony Stanislaus de Mello (11 October 1900 – 24 May 1961) was an Indian cricket administrator and one of the founders of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). He also helped launch the Asian Games as the chairman of the organising committee for the first Asian Games in Delhi.\nBackground.\nAnthony de Mello was born in Karachi in a migrant Goan family. He did his schooling from St. Patrick's High School. Sind College, and Downing College at the University of Cambridge. He started his career in the services of the businessman R. E. Grant Govan in Delhi, with whom he collaborated in founding the BCCI.\nCareer.\nBCCI and the CCI.\nThe BCCI had its origins in a meeting in February 1927 at the Roshanara Club in Delhi between Arthur Gilligan, the captain of the visiting Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team, De Mello, Grant Govan and the Maharaja of Patiala. The decision to form the board was taken at another meeting held at the same place on 22 November 1927 attended by representatives of various provinces and princely states. De Mello travelled with Grant Govan to England to organise tours of India by South Africa in 1929 and MCC in 1930–31. Both tours were eventually cancelled but the BCCI was formally founded at the Roshanara Club in December 1928 with Grant Govan as its first president and De Mello as the secretary. They represented India in the Imperial Cricket Conference in May 1929.\nDe Mello, with Grant Govan, was also instrumental in founding the Cricket Club of India (CCI). Delhi was planned as the headquarters and location of the ground for the club, but it was eventually set up in Bombay. Guha considers this as an attempt on the part of De Mello and Grant Govan to shift the headquarters of cricket in India from Bombay, but a book published by the CCI for the Golden Jubilee of the Brabourne Stadium attributes this to the unavailability of land in Delhi. De Mello played a prominent role in selecting the site and convincing Lord Brabourne, the Governor of Bombay, to allot the land for the stadium at a cheap rate.\nBCCI President and Secretary.\nDe Mello served as the Secretary of BCCI from 1928–29 to 1937-38 and President from 1946–47 to 1950–51. In the meeting of the cricket board in Simla in the summer of 1934, De Mello submitted the proposal for the national championship and a sketch of the proposed trophy which became the Ranji Trophy. \nDe Mello courted controversy later in his career (in 1951; reviewing his time as the BCCI President, \"The Times of India\" called him a 'dictator'). His tenure as the President of BCCI ended with a defeat to J. C. Mukherjee, the President of the Cricket Association of Bengal, by 12 votes to 5, in the Board meeting held at the Imperial Hotel in Delhi on 1951-08-05. He had not been on good terms with the Bengal association for some time. When in 1949, De Mello came up with serious allegations against the Indian captain Lala Amarnath, the 'Bengal lobby' had strongly supported Amarnath. Amarnath threatened to sue the board for one lakh rupees but the matter was then settled with Amarnath tendering a qualified apology to the board. In 1952, De Mello sought the presidency once again, but he opted to withdraw when he realized that his chances of winning were slim.\nCricketer.\nDe Mello's cricket career as a medium pace bowler was rather inconspicuous. Duleepsinhji once dismissed him as one 'who thinks he is a bowler but has never found anyone to agree with him on that point.' His greatest success as a bowler came for a Rest of India team against the Vizzy XI in 1930-31 where took the wickets of Jack Hobbs, Herbert Sutcliffe and C. K. Nayudu. De Mello captained the first 'Rest' team in the Bombay Pentangular.\nOrganizer.\nIn 1948, De Mello became the founder-president of the Asian Cricket Conference. He was the president of the Table Tennis Federation of India and a founder of the Table Tennis Federation of Asia. In 1949, he launched the National Sports Club of India, and was an organizer of the 1952 World Table Tennis Championships in Bombay. He was also President of the Bombay Provincial Olympic Association and a key organiser for the 1950 National Games at Bombay.\nDe Mello was the Organising Committee chair for the first Asian Games at Delhi in 1951. As the General Manager of the Gwalior and Northern India Transport System, he helped to modernise Delhi's transport system. He also headed the Jumna Valley Rail and Road Transport Company.\nDeath.\nDe Mello died following a cancer operation. He was buried in York Cemetery in New Delhi. He authored the book \"Portrait of Indian Sport\" which was published in 1959.\nLegacy.\nThe winner of the England-India Test cricket series held in India is awarded the Anthony de Mello Trophy named after him. The trophy was instituted in 1951, when England toured India for a five-match series."

        "text": "Thomas Doane Chambers (born June 21, 1959) is an American former professional basketball player. He played professionally from 1981 to 1997. Playing power forward in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Chambers was selected to four NBA All-Star Games and was a two-time All-NBA Second Team member during his career. In December 2021, Chambers was nominated to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame but did not advance to the list of finalists.\nEarly life.\nThomas Doane Chambers was born on June 21, 1959, in Ogden, Utah. Chambers starred at Fairview High School in Boulder, Colorado. Hailing from an athletic family, Chambers was a promising 6-2 guard at the end of his sophomore year. Suddenly, he grew six inches during the next six months. As a junior, teammates marveled that he had not lost any coordination with that growth. A broken wrist as a senior forced him to use his left hand more, improving his game. An all-Colorado high school player, he was hotly recruited and enrolled at Utah.\nCollege career.\nAt Utah, Chambers played center with star forward Danny Vranes. The two led successful teams in the Western Athletic Conference. He ran the floor well and had good shooting range. At the NBA level he would move to power forward. On Feb. 5, 2022, Chambers' jersey and number, 42, was retired during the Utes' game against Oregon.\nProfessional career.\nSan Diego Clippers (1981–1983).\nChambers was drafted by the-then with the 8th pick in the 1981 NBA draft. After signing a $1.5 million four-year contract, he played at forward for the first time after being a center in college. On the injury-riddled young Clippers roster his rookie year, Chambers ended up the team's top scorer at 17.2 points per game, and he made 52.5% of his shots. On April 15, 1982, he set a then-career-high points total of 39 points in a 129–123 win against the Portland Trail Blazers.\nThe following season, on October 29, 1982, Chambers scored 29 points and grabbed 16 rebounds in San Diego's home opener, a loss to the Phoenix Suns. The same season, the team had drafted power forward Terry Cummings, who went on to win Rookie of the Year, and the club felt it had to choose between the two young prospects, and they traded Chambers and Al Wood for James Donaldson, Greg Kelser, Mark Radford, a 1984 first-round draft pick (Michael Cage was later selected) and a 1985 2nd round draft pick (Calvin Duncan was later selected).\nSeattle SuperSonics (1983–1988).\nTeaming with center Jack Sikma and guard Gus Williams, Chambers became a key piece to a winning team in his third NBA season. He played all 82 games and averaged 18.1 points per game.\nThe following year, though, Williams was traded, and the point guard who emerged was Gerald Henderson. After posting a team-high 21.5 points per game the season before, Chambers fell to third-most on the team in shot attempts, taking only 28 more shots more than Henderson that season. He still led the team at 18.5 points per game, but felt he was being passed around in the offense.\n1986–87, however, was a big season for Chambers. Rookie Nate McMillan took over Henderson's spot and Chambers became one of three key scorers for the Sonics. He posted 23.3 points per game to reach All-Star status for the first time. Chambers hit 85% of 630 free throw tries that season. He also again played all 82 games.\nHe was the star of the 1987 NBA All-Star Game, played in Seattle. He scored 34 points on 13 of 25 shooting and was named Game's Most Valuable Player. With the SuperSonics, he averaged 20.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists.\nPhoenix Suns (1988–1993).\nAn avid hunter and horseback rider, Chambers had no interest in playing outside of his native West. He accepted a then-very pricey offer to join the Phoenix Suns in June 1988. Seattle declined to match the offer. He would go onto make three All-Star appearances as a Suns player.\nIn Phoenix, coach Cotton Fitzsimmons expected Chambers to shoot the ball. In 1988–89 Chambers scored 25.7 points per game. In 1989–90 his total rose to 27.2 points per game. Just as his scoring hit new highs his team also improved. Point guard Kevin Johnson was the passer Chambers had long-awaited, and the duo became an outstanding NBA tandem. On March 24, 1990, Chambers scored a Suns-franchise-record 60 points during a win over his former team the Sonics, while playing through a hamstring injury.\nFormer Seattle teammate, Xavier McDaniel, joined the team in 1990–91, and the now 31-year-old Chambers again accepted a more team-oriented role for the Suns. His scoring, and the team's success, declined. He had been twice named All-NBA Second Team, but now just tried to fit in.\nIn 1992–93, the fifth and final season in Phoenix, Charles Barkley arrived to give the team the rebounder the team had long needed to truly contend. The now 33-year-old Chambers accepted a role as sixth man, while Barkley and Dan Majerle were the team's key scorers.\nThat team made it to the 1993 NBA Finals, where they lost 4 games to 2 to Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. In the last game of the series, and what would be the last game of his Suns tenure, Chambers scored 12 points in a 99–98 Game 6 loss.\nUtah Jazz.\nChambers still felt he had more to contribute, and accepted an offer to join the Utah Jazz in August 1993. He would back up star Karl Malone, and re-team with Jeff Hornacek from the Suns. The Jazz improved immediately and made it to the 1994 Western Conference Finals. Now age 35, Chambers had one more year to give before ending his first stint in the NBA as a 20,024-point NBA scorer.\nMaccabi Tel Aviv (1995–1996).\nChambers joined Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel, for a season of play in the Israeli Super League and the FIBA EuroLeague, during the 1995–96 season. In the Israeli Super League, Chambers averaged 17.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game. He also won the Israeli League championship that season with Maccabi. In the FIBA EuroLeague's 1995–96 season, Chambers averaged 15.1 points, 6.8 rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 0.7 steals per game, in 32.8 minutes per game.\nCharlotte Hornets (1997).\nAfter his stint in Israel, Chambers decided to reunite with the Phoenix Suns. However, before playing a single game of a second run there, he was traded to the Charlotte Hornets. He played twelve games with the Hornets but was then waived.\nPhiladelphia 76ers (1997).\nChambers would play in one more NBA game, with the Philadelphia 76ers, during the 1997–98 regular season, before retiring. In the last game of his career, played on November 26, 1997, he had six points, two rebounds, and two steals for the 76ers, against the Cleveland Cavaliers, in his only appearance with the team.\nPlayer profile.\nChambers appeared in 16 NBA seasons as a member of the , Seattle SuperSonics, Phoenix Suns, Utah Jazz, Charlotte Hornets, and Philadelphia 76ers. Chambers scored 20,049 total points in the NBA for a career average of 18.1 points per game. His career high was a 60-point performance with the Suns against the Sonics on March 24, 1990. He appeared in four NBA All-Star Games during his career (1987, 1989, 1990, and 1991), earning game MVP honors in 1987 after scoring 34 points. He also played in the 1993 NBA Finals as a member of the Suns, but his team lost to the Chicago Bulls. He is one of just two players (alongside Antawn Jamison) currently eligible for induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame who have scored 20,000 points who have not been inducted.\nLegacy.\nChambers was inducted into the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor in April 1999 and became the first inductee since the Ring of Honor was installed at the then-America West Arena (now Footprint Center). As part of the induction ceremony, he received a bronze statue by artist Sam Wickey recreating his 1989 dunk over the New York Knicks guard Mark Jackson. Chambers was also honored with being inducted into the Utah Sports Hall of Fame in 2010, and the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame in 2019.\nPersonal life.\nAfter his playing career ended, Chambers bought a ranch in North Ogden for himself and family which became known as Shooting Star Ranch. Soon after, he became a community relations representative for the Suns, sold his ranch in Ogden, and moved permanently to Scottsdale, Arizona, with his family.\nHe won a Rocky Mountain Emmy alongside senior editor Tommy Arguelles for their work on \"Sunderella Suns\", a film commemorating the 40th anniversary of the 1975–76 Phoenix Suns season and the impact that season had on the state of Arizona as a whole."

        "text": "William Lee Austin (October 18, 1928 – May 22, 2013) was an American football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL). He played as a lineman for the New York Giants for seven seasons, was the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers for three seasons, (1966–1968) and one for the Washington Redskins in 1970.\nEarly years.\nBorn in San Pedro, California, Austin was raised in Oregon and graduated from Woodburn High School, south of Portland. He played college football at Oregon State College in Corvallis, earning All-Coast honors as a tackle in 1948 and played in the 1949 East–West Shrine Game. He was inducted into the OSU Athletics Hall of Fame and was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity.\nPlaying career.\nSelected in the thirteenth round of the 1949 NFL draft with the 126th overall pick, Austin played seven seasons with the Giants, including the 1956 title year. He missed the 1951 and 1952 seasons due to military service in the U.S. Army, stationed in San Francisco and Tokyo. He made the Pro Bowl in 1954 and retired after the 1957 season.\nCoaching career.\nAustin began his coaching career at Wichita University for a season in 1958, then joined first-year head coach Vince Lombardi as offensive line coach for the Green Bay Packers in 1959. Lombardi was the offensive coordinator of the Giants for the previous five seasons, including the 1956 championship year. Austin coached in Green Bay for six seasons, mentoring pulling guards Jerry Kramer and Fuzzy Thurston, and hall of famers Forrest Gregg and Jim Ringo. The Packers played in the NFL championship game for three consecutive seasons, with wins in 1961 and 1962.\nSeeking a warmer climate for his wife's health, Austin left Green Bay after the 1964 season for the Los Angeles Rams for a season as an assistant, then became head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers at age 37 in January 1966, with a recommendation by Lombardi. He failed to produce a winning season in three seasons, finishing 11–28–3 (), and was fired after the 1968 season (2–11–1), succeeded by Chuck Noll.\nAustin rejoined Lombardi in Washington as an assistant in 1969, then took over as interim head coach when Lombardi died of cancer before the 1970 season on September 3. Dismissed by telephone after that 6–8 season, he returned to his role as an assistant coach in the NFL (and USFL) for the remainder of his career, including a stint as offensive line coach for the Giants in the early 1980s.\nAustin was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1982, and retired to Las Vegas in 1985. He died at age 84 at his home in Las Vegas in 2013."

        "text": "Wimbledon was a local government district in north-east Surrey from 1866 to 1965 covering the town of Wimbledon and its surrounding area. It was part of the London postal district and Metropolitan Police District.\nHistory.\nWimbledon Local Government District was formed in 1866 when the parish of Wimbledon adopted the Local Government Act 1858, forming a local board of 15 members to govern the area. The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the area as an urban district. The town was granted a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough in 1905. A borough council consisting of a mayor, six aldermen and eighteen councillors replaced the urban district council. The original Wimbledon Town Hall was built on The Broadway. This was replaced by a new Town Hall on the corner of Queen's Road and Wimbledon Bridge in 1931.\nThe borough was granted a coat of arms in 1906. The arms incorporated heraldic elements associated with the history of the borough through the centuries. A black double-headed eagle refers to the legend that Julius Caesar once made camp on the common, a sheaf of corn is borrowed from the arms of the Cecil family and the two Cornish Choughs above the crown are taken from the arms of Thomas Cromwell. The new borough took as its motto \"Sine Labe Decus\" meaning: \"Honour without Stain\".\nIn 1914 Wimbledon unsuccessfully promoted a bill to become a county borough.\nThe borough was abolished in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963 and the area was transferred to Greater London to be combined with that the Municipal Borough of Mitcham and the Merton and Morden Urban District to form the present-day London Borough of Merton."

        "title": "Willie Davis (baseball)",
        "text": "William Henry Davis (April 15, 1940 – March 9, 2010) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball and the Nippon Professional Baseball league as a center fielder from through , most prominently as an integral member of the Los Angeles Dodgers teams that won three National League pennants and two World Series titles between and .\nKnown for his speed and agility as an outfielder as well as a base runner, Davis was a three-time Gold Glove Award winner and a two-time National League (NL) All-Star player during his tenure with the Dodgers. He ranks fifth among center fielders in Major League Baseball history in career putouts. He also played for the Montreal Expos, Texas Rangers, St. Louis Cardinals, and the San Diego Padres before spending two seasons in the Nippon Professional Baseball league with the Chunichi Dragons and the Crown Lighter Lions. After his stint in Japan, Davis returned to Major League Baseball where he played one final season with the California Angels in 1979.\nAt the time of his retirement in 1979, Davis had accumulated 2,561 hits over his 18-year playing career. He ranked seventh in major league history in putouts (5,449) and total chances (5,719) in the outfield, and third in games in center field (2,237). He was ninth in National League history in total outfield games (2,274). He had 13 seasons of 20 or more stolen bases, led the NL in triples twice, and retired with the fourth most triples (138) by any major leaguer since 1945. He holds Los Angeles club records (1958–present) for career hits (2,091), runs (1,004), triples (110), at bats (7,495), total bases (3,094) and extra base hits (585). His 31-game hitting streak in remains as the Dodgers team record more than 50 years after his retirement.\nCareer.\nAs a youngster, Davis moved to Los Angeles, where he was a three-sport standout in baseball, basketball, and track and field at Theodore Roosevelt High School. He once ran a 9.5-second 100-yard dash, and set a city record in the long jump of 25 feet 5 inches (7.75 m). Discovered by the Dodgers scout, Kenny Myers, Davis signed with the ballclub upon graduating from Roosevelt in 1958.\nDavis played his first game with the Los Angeles Dodgers in . The following season he replaced the former All-Star Duke Snider in center field, where Davis stayed for 13 years. Widely considered to be one of the fastest baseball players of the 1960s, Davis had 20 or more stolen bases in eleven consecutive seasons, with a career-high 42 in . Along with Maury Wills, Davis provided footspeed at the top of Dodgers' lineup. In 1962, these two players \"set the table\" for teammate Tommy Davis to lead the National League with 153 runs batted in (RBI), a Los Angeles Dodgers single-season record. Willie Davis, along with Maury Wills, was a key part of the Dodgers' National League titles in 1963, 1965, and 1966.\nIn , Davis batted .285 with 85 runs batted in, posting career highs in home runs (21), runs (103), and hits (171). In that same season, Davis and Wills set a National League record for stolen bases by two teammates in season with 136 (Wills with 104 and Davis with 32). 1962 was the first of two seasons that Davis would lead the National League in triples. It was the first of two seasons that he would tally double-figure totals in doubles, triples, home runs, and stolen bases.\nDavis was a part of two World Series championship teams, in 1963 and 1965. In the 1963 World Series He knocked in the game winning run with a 1st inning 2 run double in game 2 and in game 4 the game that clinched the World Series, he hit the game winning RBI with a Sacrifice Fly in the 7th Inning. In the 1965 World Series, Davis set a record (since broken) of three stolen bases in a single game -- including one during which he stumbled and fell, the pitcher hesitated throwing to first base, and Davis literally crawled to second base safely.\nDavis committed a World Series record three errors on two consecutive plays, in the fifth inning of Game Two of the 1966 World Series. First, he lost Paul Blair's fly ball in the sun for a two-base error. One batter later, he dropped Andy Etchebarren's fly ball. When he recovered the Etchebarren ball, Davis threw it over third base, allowing Boog Powell and Blair to score. When questioned after the game, he said, \"Even when you can't see the ball you have to take a stab at it, I couldn't see the ball in the sun.\" The Orioles swept the Dodgers, four games to none. The Dodgers did not score a run in Game Two, Game Three, or Game Four. In Game Four, Davis made a leaping catch at the centerfield fence, robbing Powell of a home run.\nDavis batted a career-high .311 in . His 31-game hitting streak that year, from August 1 to September 3, was the longest in the major leagues since , when Dom DiMaggio hit in 34 straight. Davis' streak broke the previous franchise record of 29, set in by Zack Wheat. When he tied Wheat's previous record at 29 games, the message board at Dodger Stadium flashed a message sent via telegram by Wheat from his home in Missouri, saying, \"Congratulations. Keep going. You have done a good job. Good luck.\" Davis was named NL Player of the Month of August with a .459 batting average. During the streak, his season average climbed from .259 to .316.\nIn , Davis batted .305, posting career highs in triples (16) and RBI (93). His 16 triples led all major league players, and was the second time he led the National League in triples.\nHe ended with career highs in doubles (33) and total bases (281). He batted .309, his third straight season topping .300. For the second time, he posted double-figure totals in doubles, triples, home runs and stolen bases. Davis was selected for his first (of two) National League All-Star team in 1971. He was awarded his first (of three) Gold Glove award.\nDavis won three consecutive Gold Glove awards, 1971 through 1973. He was the first National League outfielder who threw left-handed to be so honored, and just the second in Major League history (the first was Vic Davalillo, who won an American League Gold Glove in 1964). For his career, Davis led the NL in putouts by an outfielder twice, in 1964 and 1971. He led NL center fielders in assists twice, in 1963 and 1964. He led NL center fielders in fielding percentage twice, in 1970 and 1976. He also led centerfielders in errors five times, in 1962, 1963, 1965, 1968, and 1974.\nIn two All-Star games, 1971 and 1973, he batted a combined 3-for-3, with a home run off Nolan Ryan.\nDavis was traded from the Dodgers to the Montreal Expos for Mike Marshall at the Winter Meetings on December 5, 1973. Marshall would win the Cy Young Award in . Davis batted .295 with 12 home runs and 25 stolen bases and led the team in hits (180), runs (86), doubles (27), triples (9) and RBI (89) in his only season with the Expos which dealt him to the Texas Rangers for Don Stanhouse and Pete Mackanin at the Winter Meetings on December 5, 1974. Davis hit .249 with five home runs and 17 RBI in 42 games with the Rangers before being sent to the St. Louis Cardinals for Ed Brinkman and Tommy Moore on June 4, 1975. After batting .291, he was traded for a third time within a year when he was dealt from the Cardinals to the San Diego Padres for Dick Sharon on October 20, 1975. He batted .268 with the Padres in 1976, then he spent two years in Japan with the Chunichi Dragons and Crown Lighter Lions.\nHe played his final major league season with the California Angels in 1979, making two pinch-hitting appearances in the American League Championship Series. He played in the Mexican League in 1980, managing part of the year, before retiring.\nIn an 18-year career, Davis accumulated a .279 batting average with 182 home runs and 1,053 RBI in 2,429 games. He also collected 2,561 hits and 398 stolen bases. His total of 2,237 games in center field ranks behind only Willie Mays (2,827) and Tris Speaker (2,690) in major league history. In addition to the Los Angeles records he retains, his club mark of 1,952 games was surpassed by Bill Russell in 1984; Steve Garvey broke his records of 849 RBI and 321 doubles in 1981 and 1982 respectively. Garvey and Ron Cey passed his Los Angeles club record of 154 home runs in 1979; Davis' record for left-handed hitters was broken by Shawn Green in 2004.\nDespite his impressive career, Davis was excluded from the 1985 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, the first year for which he would have been eligible, nor has he been added to subsequent ballots. His 60.7 career WAR (according to Baseball Reference) is the highest among all players to not appear on a Hall of Fame ballot (excluding banned players). \nLegacy and post-baseball.\nDavis married Jeanna LemYou, whom he met in Los Angeles while a member of the Dodgers, on September 5, 1963. Davis subsequently adopted Jeanna's son, Gregory Chapman Davis. Jeanna and Davis had two daughters, Kimberly in 1964 and Jennifer in 1967, before divorcing in 1975. Davis also had another son, Shonan Casey Davis, with his second wife, Amy Rumbelow. \nA convert to Buddhism via his marriage to Jeanna, Davis constantly fingered his prayer beads and chanted before games. When Davis played in Japan, he hoped his host country would embrace his religion. However, his enthusiastic display of his religion disturbed his Japanese teammates and his fervent pregame chanting made them feel as if they were attending a Buddhist funeral, according to his manager, Wally Yonamine.\nDavis appeared in several TV programs, including \"Mr. Ed\", \"The Flying Nun\", and \"\", and was a co-star of the Jerry Lewis comedy film from 1970, \"Which Way to the Front?\". In a 1969 episode of \"Bewitched\", Samantha, attending a game at Shea Stadium to see the New York Mets host the Dodgers, remarks \"Willie Davis just hit a grand slam!\" The episode was filmed August 22, 1969, a date when the Mets coincidentally beat the Dodgers at Shea. In reality, Davis went 2 for 4 in the game, but did not hit a grand slam.\nDavis was found dead in his home in Burbank, California, on March 9, 2010, by a neighbor who sometimes brought him breakfast. Initial indications showed he most likely died of natural causes. Davis had four children.\nDavis, an Arkansas native, was voted 21st-greatest Arkansas sports figure by \"Sports Illustrated,\" along with former teammate Lou Brock, who was also on the list."

        "text": "Christopher Lemonte Mills (born January 25, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player who played ten seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nHigh school.\nChris Mills attended Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, from 1986 to 1988. At 6 ft 7 in, he was the starting center for each of his three years playing varsity basketball there. In 1987 and 1988, he was awarded the City 4-A Player of the Year Award, as well as Mr. Basketball for the state of California. He was a 1988 McDonald's All-American in basketball.\nEl Camino Real High School basketball coach, Mike McNulty said of Chris Mills, \"He's one of the three best players ever to come out of Los Angeles—he's gotta be right there with John Williams and Marques Johnson.\" Taft High School basketball coach, Jim Woodard, echoed these sentiments when he said, \"I've been watching city basketball for 33 years. Mills is the best I've ever seen. He can do it all.\"\nCollege.\nMills graduated from University of Arizona, having been kicked off the team at the University of Kentucky by the NCAA after the 1988–89 season. He was the center of a scandal involving receiving improper payments, allegedly from a UK booster. The scandal broke when a package addressed to Mills' father, Claud Mills, popped open while being sorted at Emery Worldwide, whose employees later testified that it contained a video cassette and fifty $20 bills. Claud Mills claims the package did not contain any cash when it was delivered.\nProfessional career.\nHe was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers as the 22nd overall pick in the 1993 NBA draft, for whom he played four seasons (1993-94 through 1997-98). Mills then played for the New York Knicks for the 1997–98 season. He played the next five seasons (1998-99 through 2002-03) for the Golden State Warriors. \nIn 1999, in a game against the Dallas Mavericks, after a jump ball, Mills attempted to make a basket, but on the wrong side of the court. Amazingly, his shot was blocked by opposing player Samaki Walker.\nOutside basketball.\nMills recorded a rap single entitled \"Sumptin' to Groove To,\" along with several NBA players such as Jason Kidd, Cedric Ceballos and J.R. Rider on the album B-Ball's Best Kept Secret released in 1994. He is also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.\nHe also had a role in the 1994 movie Blue Chips along with several other professional athletes and coaches. As well as a role in the 1998 movie Da Game of Life, as a basketball player named Scooter."

        "text": "The 2005 Japanese Grand Prix (officially known as the 2005 Formula One Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One race which was held at Suzuka International Racing Course on 9 October 2005. It was the eighteenth and penultimate round of the 2005 Formula One World Championship, the thirty-first running of the Japanese Grand Prix and nineteenth to be held at Suzuka.\nKimi Räikkönen won the race after starting from seventeenth, overtaking long-time race leader Giancarlo Fisichella on the final lap to win a race that saw many overtaking manoeuvres. Fisichella’s teammate Fernando Alonso completed the podium, having come through from sixteenth, including an overtake on Michael Schumacher around the outside of 130R corner.\nThe race marked Ralf Schumacher’s sixth and final pole position in Formula One.\nThis was also Räikkönen's last win until the 2007 Australian Grand Prix, his last win for McLaren and McLaren's last win until the 2007 Malaysian Grand Prix.\nBackground.\nFernando Alonso was crowned world champion at the previous round in Brazil, but the battle for the Constructors’ Championship between McLaren-Mercedes and Renault continued at the penultimate round, with McLaren leading by two points.\nAt a press conference before the Japanese Grand Prix, Honda announced the acquisition of all shares in BAR. Toyota decided to bring the renewed TF105B to the last two races of the season.\nAntônio Pizzonia, who was already at the wheel of Williams in the three previous Grands Prix, was confirmed as a replacement for the injured Nick Heidfeld for the last two races of the season as well. One option to replace Heidfeld's in the last two races was test driver Nico Rosberg. The fact that two races are run on new tracks prevented this possibility.\nPractice.\nTeams that finished fifth or lower in the 2004 Constructors’ Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers participated on Friday, but did not compete in qualifying or the race. Of the six teams, only four had third drivers at Suzuka: McLaren (Pedro de la Rosa), Red Bull (Vitantonio Liuzzi), Toyota (Ricardo Zonta) and Jordan (Sakon Yamamoto).\nPedro de la Rosa was fastest in first free practice, completing 23 laps and finished more than half a second ahead of Ricardo Zonta, who was more than a second faster than Michael Schumacher in FP2. The weather took a turn for the worse on Saturday and had an effect on the amount of running in the final two practice sessions. Michael Schumacher ended up top of the timesheets in FP3, over two seconds quicker than Kimi Räikkönen, with Giancarlo Fisichella clocking the fastest time in final practice, edging out Narain Karthikeyan by 0.014s.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was held on a wet track, with conditions later deteriorating, forcing some of the usual front runners to qualify near the back of the grid. Ralf Schumacher qualified on pole, edging out Jenson Button by 0.035s. Fisichella was third, with home favourite Takuma Sato in fifth. The end of qualifying saw the top finishers from the last race attempt to set a lap time. But by this point the conditions had worsened and Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso, Kimi Räikkönen and Juan Pablo Montoya all qualifying in fourteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth places respectively. Montoya did not set a lap time. Jarno Trulli and Tiago Monteiro also failed to set a time.\nRace.\nRalf Schumacher maintained the lead off the start, with Giancarlo Fisichella jumped Jenson Button and Red Bull's David Coulthard moved from sixth to eighth. But local hero Sato ran wide into the gravel at turn one and his right-front tyre was sideswiped by Rubens Barrichello. Both continued, but the left rear of Barrichello's Ferrari was punctured, leading to a pit stop at the end of lap one. Alonso made a flying start and was up to seventh by the time the field was completing the first lap. Raikkonen went straight on at the Casio Triangle chicane, before teammate Juan Pablo Montoya crashed heavily while coming onto the pit straight after trying to drive around the Sauber of Jacques Villeneuve, but the Canadian squeezed him and onto the gravel, making the Colombian the first retirement of the afternoon and severely damaging McLaren's Constructors' Championship hopes. The accident resulted in the safety car being deployed.\nOn lap 10, Sato attempted to overtake Trulli into the chicane, but never looked like pulling the move off and the resulting contact forced Trulli into retirement. Ralf was the first of the leaders to pit, coming in for the first of three stops at the end of lap 13. This counted him out of the running for the race victory, with Fisichella assuming the lead.\nOn lap 19, Alonso pulled off one of the most audacious overtaking manoeuvres with a pass around the outside of Michael Schumacher at the infamous 130R corner. Raikkonen had a sniff of passing the seven-time world champion into the very next turn, the Casio Triangle, but had to settle in behind the Ferrari. Alonso stopped first of the trio, but because he pitted for fuel before Michael and Raikkonen, he came back out behind the duo, with Raikkonen passing Michael on the pit straight on lap 29. On lap 32, Michael went deep into the chicane, giving Alonso the opportunity to pass again, which he did down the pit straight and swept into turn one ahead of the German.\nRaikkonen made his final stop on lap 45, handing the lead back to Fisichella. But as he emerged from the pits, Raikkonen was about to go on a thrilling charge. Alonso had closed up to the back of the Williams-BMW of Mark Webber by the end of lap 49 and despite being forced onto the grass, the world champion was able to complete the overtake on the Australian and took third place. Raikkonen took 1.3 seconds out of Fisichella's lead on lap 49 and was now right on the rear-wing of the Italian. Raikkonen lined up the overtake going into the chicane, but Fisichella went defensive, leaving him vulnerable to an attack from Raikkonen, who was given all the motivation he needed to slingshot past the Renault into turn one to complete a brilliant recovery drive for his seventh win of the season.\nPost-race.\nJacques Villeneuve had 25 seconds added to his race time for causing Juan Pablo Montoya to crash out on the first lap, while Takuma Sato was disqualified from the final classification for his lap 10 collision with Jarno Trulli which caused the Italian to retire from the race.\nChampionship standings after the race.\nDrivers' Championship standings\nConstructors' Championship standings"

The national team is administered by the Norwegian Basketball Federation.\nNorway has never had great success on the international stage in the past. They are one of the few European countries to date to have never qualified for one of the top international basketball competitions, such as the EuroBasket or the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nNorway's first international match was played on 11 February 1967 in Oslo, where the team lost 50–63 to Denmark. The most capped player is Torgeir Bryn, with 111 caps.\nIn the past, Norway has attempted to qualify for the EuroBasket several times, but have yet to reach the tournament. They have only entered the Olympic basketball qualification twice, for the 1980, and 1988 Olympic Games. Norway is one of Europe's most populous nations to have never qualified for a major international basketball competition. However, they have competed at smaller events such as the European Championship for Small Countries.\nThe Road to Revival (2012–2017).\nIn 2012, financial troubles led the Norwegian Basketball Federation to shut down both the men's and women's national teams. The federation simply did not have the funds to keep either the men's or women's teams afloat. Since then, however, the federation has come to realize just how many people from the athletes and teams, to individuals and companies care about the Norwegian basketball community and are willing to provide financial support. The federation also worked to raise money through sponsorships, and eventually signed a major sponsorship agreement with Circle K, in addition to a few smaller sponsors.\nNorway's return (2018–present).\nIn 2018, Norway made its return to FIBA competition by playing at the European Championship for Small Countries.

        "text": "Justin Ray Thompson (born March 8, 1973) is an American former Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Detroit Tigers from 1996 to 1999 and the Texas Rangers in 2005.\nCareer.\nThompson was drafted out of high school in the first round of the 1991 MLB draft and started his career in Detroit Tigers minor league system. Thompson started his professional career with the rookie-level Bristol Tigers of the Appalachian League in 1991. Thompson moved up to Class A the next year joining the South Atlantic League's Fayetteville Generals in 1992. In 1993, Thompson split time in Class A and Double-A, playing with the Lakeland Tigers of the Florida State League and the Eastern League's London Tigers.\nThompson made his major-league debut in 1996. He was selected to the American League (AL) All-Star team in 1997, at the age of 24, during a season in which he won 15 games and finished fifth in the AL with a 3.02 ERA. He continued to pitch well in 1998, finishing second in the AL in games started, with 34. Injury problems, however, derailed his 1999 season.\nThompson was traded by the Tigers to the Texas Rangers in an eight-player trade after the 1999 season that involved Juan González being sent to Detroit. Thompson spent six seasons in Minor League Baseball with the Rangers organization, including a missed 2001 season due to a torn rotator cuff suffered in 2000, before playing in MLB again for two games in 2005. Thompson elected free agency after the 2005 season and subsequently signed a minor-league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers in December 2005. In May 2006, Thompson retired after playing eight games for Milwaukee's Triple-A affiliate, the Nashville Sounds."

        "title": "1968 in baseball",
        "text": "The Year of the Pitcher.\nIn Major League Baseball, the trend throughout the 1960s was of increased pitching dominance. After the record home run year by Roger Maris in 1961, the major leagues increased the size of the strike zone from the top of the batter's shoulders to the bottom of his knees. A significant \"power shortage\" culminated in 1968, with far fewer runs scored than in the early 1960s.\nPitchers including Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals and Denny McLain of the Detroit Tigers dominated hitters, producing 339 shutouts in 1968, almost double the number of shutouts thrown in 1962. Individually, Gibson set a modern earned run average record of 1.12, the lowest in 54 years, and set a World Series record of 17 strikeouts in Game 1. McLain won 31 regular season games, the only player to reach the 30 win milestone since Dizzy Dean in 1934. Mickey Lolich won three complete games in the World Series, the last player as of 2015 to do so. Luis Tiant of the Cleveland Indians had the American League's lowest ERA at 1.60 and allowed a batting average of only .168, a major league record. Don Drysdale of the Los Angeles Dodgers threw a record 58 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings, and Catfish Hunter of the Oakland Athletics was the first American League pitcher to record a perfect game since Don Larsen in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series.\nHitting was anemic as Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox would be the only American League hitter to finish the season with a batting average higher than .300. Yastrzemski's batting average of .301 was the lowest batting average of any league batting champion. The American League's collective slugging average of .340 remains the lowest since 1915 (when the game was still in the so-called dead-ball era), while the collective batting average of .231 is the all-time lowest. As a result of the dropping offensive statistics, Major League Baseball Rules Committee took steps to reduce the advantage held by pitchers by lowering the height of the pitchers mound from 15 inches to 10 inches, and by reducing the size of the strike zone for the 1969 season. 1969 batting averages climbed back to their historical averages and never again would pitching have as large a statistical average over batting in the major leagues.\n1968 was the final year when baseball had no divisions within the two leagues, with the only post-season competition being the World Series itself. Four expansion teams would join baseball for the season following in 1969. This was also the first season that the Athletics franchise played in Oakland, California, after their departure from Kansas City, Missouri."

        "title": "Latvia men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Latvia men's national basketball team () represents Latvia in international basketball. They are organized and run by the Latvian Basketball Association. Latvia has reached the European Basketball Championship 15 times, with their ultimate success occurring during the inter-war period, when they became the first team to win the tournament in 1935. Four years later, they had another impressive run to come away with the silver in 1939. Although after 1939, Latvia were forced to suspend their national team operations, due to the Occupation of the Baltic states during World War II. Latvia regained independence in 1991, with their national team taking part in international competition once again a year later.\nHistory.\nOrigins of the team.\nOn 26 November 1923, the Latvijas Basketbola Savienība was founded, earlier than most basketball federations from other countries.\nOn 29 April 1924, Latvia played their first international game versus Estonia, winning it 20–16.\nIn the winter of 1924, the first men's basketball championship was held, while the first women's championship was organized in 1933.\nLatvians, like their Baltic neighbors Lithuanians and Estonians, also began playing basketball in the 1920s, quickly rising as the strongest of the Baltic teams. On 13 December 1925 in Riga, when the Lithuanian national team played their first international game. Latvia easily swept them with the score of 41–20. Later on, Latvia continued to dominate the future three-times European champions as well (41–29 and 123–10). In fact, Latvia had one of the world's strongest national basketball teams. The first Latvian teams consisted of students and pupils, who were trained by coaches of the American YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association).\nLatvia also was one of the eight countries which signed the founding act of FIBA on 18 June 1932 in Geneva, along with Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Argentina. The Latvian representative in this event was Jāzeps Šadeiko.\nEuroBasket 1935.\nThe Latvians won the first European basketball championship, the EuroBasket 1935 held by the International Basketball Federation's FIBA Europe continental federation. They defeated Hungary in the preliminary round, Switzerland in the semi-finals, and Spain in the final to finish at the top of the ten-nation field.\nLatvia held their opponents to 49 points over three games, the lowest points-against average in the tournament. Their scoring rate, 98 points over three games for 32.67 points per game, was second only to France.\nLatvia is the smallest country in population to ever win the EuroBasket.\nIn 2012, Latvian film director Aigars Grauba directed the historical sports drama \"Dream Team 1935\" about the journey of the Latvian team towards winning the title.\n1936 Summer Olympic Games (Berlin 1936).\nThe Latvia national basketball team participated in the first appearance of basketball as an official Olympic medal event. Latvia were reigning European champions and were considered to be one of the pre-tournament favorites. Although the Olympics did not go that well for the Latvians. They began the tournament with a 20–17 victory over Uruguay. However, they were soundly beaten 23–34 by Canada and after suffering another defeat to Poland 23–28, the Latvians did not qualify for the knockout stage, unlike their neighbors Estonia. This was the first and only appearance for Latvia at the Olympic Games as of 2019 (their female counterparts made their first appearance in 2008).\nEuroBasket 1937.\nAt the EuroBasket 1937, the reigning champions got off to a great start in their first game in the tournament by blowing out Czechoslovakia 44–11. In their second game they lost a close one to Poland to drop to (1–1) in the standings. They finished up group play with a needed win against France to put them in a three-way tie for the lead of the four-team group. However, it wouldn't be enough for the national team to reach the semi-finals as they came out on the bottom of the tie-breaker against Poland and France. This result came about despite the Latvians being the highest-scoring team in the entire tournament and allowing fewer opponent points than any of the other teams in their group.\nBeing in the bottom half of the preliminary group meant that the team could finish no better than fifth. In the classification semifinal, Latvia faced Egypt, which had withdrawn after their first two preliminary matches. They advanced to the 5th/6th place playoff, which they lost to Estonia 41–19.\nEuroBasket 1939.\nIn 1939, despite losing twice, including a rematch of the 1937 game against Estonia, Latvia secured silver medals with 5 wins. Poland, which also had a 5–2 record, finished third as Latvia had won the match between the two teams. The tournament's opening and, in retrospect, decisive game between Latvia and Lithuania ended in a dramatic late victory for the hosts and eventual champions Lithuania, souring the sports relations between the two countries and leading to the cancellation of the 1939 Baltic Cup.\nOne of the 1939's vice-champions, Alfrēds Krauklis, once said: \"Frankly saying – these three Baltic states raised the European basketball. Now they say that its Spanish, and so what? Let them say... And I say – it's our merit!\".\nSoviet and Nazi period (1940–1991).\nDue to Soviet and Nazi occupations, Latvians were unable to represent Latvia in FIBA organized tournaments or the Olympic Games. Instead, they were forced to play for the Soviet Union national team.\nHorrific times in Latvia began. In 1940 the massive people deportations started, implemented by the Soviets. Thousands of Latvians were forced to leave their homeland, thousands of them died due to the active warfare during World War II.\nThough, despite all the cruel challenges, basketball was continued to be played and retained its popularity in Latvia. In 1941 a Baltic States tournament was organized in Kaunas Sports Hall. The Lithuanian SSR team won the final against the Latvian SSR, 38–33.\nAt the 1952 Summer Olympics, Maigonis Valdmanis became the first Latvian representative on the Soviet squad, which won the Olympic silver medals that year. A few years later two other Latvian basketball stars joined the team: Jānis Krūmiņš and Valdis Muižnieks. Later on, the trio won two EuroBasket titles and two times became Olympic vice-champions together.\nIn the 1950s, Rīgas ASK, coached by the Soviet legend Aleksandr Gomelsky, became the major force of the Soviet Union and even Europe by winning three consecutive European Cup titles from 1958 to 1960. The club's roster had multiple European champions in Jānis Krūmiņš, Maigonis Valdmanis and Valdis Muižnieks. Furthermore, in 1960 TTT Riga won the European Cup for Women's Clubs, undoubtedly turning Riga into the capital of basketball with the two major European basketball titles held by the single city's clubs at the same time. And it only was the first of the stunning 18 European titles.\nIn later years other Latvian basketball stars appeared, such as Valdis Valters and Igors Miglinieks, both of whom were eventually crowned as Olympic champions. Valdis Valters is considered to be one of Europe's greatest basketball players of the 1980s. In addition to his Olympic title, he also won the World Cup in 1982 and became the European champion twice, being named as the MVP of EuroBasket 1981.\nAfter the restoration of independence (from 1991).\nOn 4 May 1990 Latvia declared the country's independence from the Soviet Union. Consequently, in September 1991 its basketball federation was re-affiliated with FIBA. Though, despite having some remarkable players like Valdis Valters, Igors Miglinieks, Ainars Bagatskis, Kaspars Kambala, Andris Biedriņš, Latvia failed to recover its inter-war glory. Their best result after restoring the country's independence is the 5th place achieved at EuroBasket 2017. Although, basketball is slowly regaining its power in Latvia with the help of the medals-winning youth squads.\nEuroBasket 2013.\nDuring EuroBasket 2013, Latvia began their tournament run with two wins against Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro before facing longtime Baltic rival Lithuania. Although in the highly anticipated match between the two nations, Lithuania prevailed 67–59. Latvia then lost their next match versus Serbia, but rebounded to win their final fixture in group play against Macedonia to advance.\nIn the second group phase of the tournament Latvia displayed immediate dominance in their first game of group play over Ukraine winning 86–51. It turned out to be the only win Latvia would record in the group, as they were eventually eliminated.\nEuroBasket 2015.\nAs one of the hosts for EuroBasket 2015 in Riga, Latvia began their campaign at the tournament victorious over Belgium 78–67. In their second match, they were once again pitted against their rivals Lithuania. Latvia looked to avenge their lost from the prior EuroBasket showdown between the two, as the national team got off to a strong start in the 1st quarter. Unfortunately, the Latvians were unable to maintain the momentum they started the match with, as they fell to their rivals again, 68–49. While it was demoralizing for Latvia to be defeated in that manner in front of their home crowd, they recovered quickly to win two out of the next three matches they played to move on to the knockout stage. There, Latvia beat Slovenia to advance to the quarter-finals, but ultimately fell short to the eventual bronze medalist France.\nEuroBasket 2017.\nAt EuroBasket 2017, Latvia entered the competition with high expectations, as they fielded one of their most potent lineups ever. With the addition of Latvian star Kristaps Porziņģis joining the senior national team for the first time, Latvia was poised to go on a long tournament run. But in their first match they were out lasted by a veteran Serbian squad, 92–82. Although, the national team bounced back in a huge way dismantling Belgium 92–64, with Porziņģis and Jānis Timma leading the way in scoring with 27 points apiece. They also went on to win their next three matches in group play to finish with a (4–1) record, to earn a spot in the knockout rounds. In their round of 16 match up, they throttled Montenegro 100–68. Latvia ran into an buzz saw in their quarter-finals match though, falling to the eventual champions Slovenia.\nLatvia finished fifth in the tournament overall, reaching their best post-war result in the history of the national team, in which Kristaps Porziņģis debuted with astonishing averages of 23.6 points, 5.9 rebounds and 1.9 blocks at the age of 22.\nRecent years (2019–2022).\nOn 1 August 2019, Latvia named former player Roberts Štelmahers the new head coach of the national team. He replaced Arnis Vecvagars. In March 2022, Latvia was selected as one of the four co-hosts for EuroBasket 2025, where they will host one preliminary phase group, as well as the knockout rounds.\nRoad to the 2023 FIBA World Cup.\nAfter the signing of Luca Banchi as head coach in 2021, Latvia went on to qualify for the 2023 FIBA World Cup, making it the first time the national team would appear at the World Cup finals.\nLatvia entered the competition with high hopes, however, their biggest star Kristaps Porziņģis was unable to represent the team during the 2023 FIBA World Cup, due to failing to recover from an injury. Nevertheless, Latvia surprisingly eliminated European vice-champions France in the first round by winning a decisive game 88–86 and qualified to the second round of the 2023 FIBA World Cup with two victories (also versus Lebanon 109–70) and one 101–75 loss to Canada. One of the Latvian team leaders Dāvis Bertāns described victory versus France as \"the biggest win in Latvian basketball history since 1935\". In the second round Latvia achieved yet another memorable 74–69 victory versus the reigning world champions Spain. In the next game Latvia crushed Brazil 104–84 and advanced to the quarter-finals as the second-best team in the group, leaving Spain and Brazil behind without playoffs. But in quarter-final Latvia lost to Germany in the last seconds with the result 79–81 and did not directly qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics. Latvia finished the tournament in fifth place after defeating Italy (82–87) and Lithuania (98–63).\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 22 and 25 February 2024

        "text": "Major League Baseball on CBS is the branding used for broadcasts of Major League Baseball (MLB) games produced by CBS Sports, the sports division of the CBS television network in the United States.\nHistory.\nThe network has aired Major League Baseball telecasts in several variations dating back to the 1950s.\n1947–1951.\nCBS broadcast Games 3–4 of the 1947 World Series (the first World Series to ever be televised) with Bob Edge on the call. However, the 1947 World Series was only seen in four markets via coaxial inter-connected stations: New York City; Philadelphia; Schenectady, New York; Washington, D.C.; and, environs surrounding these cities. Outside of New York, coverage was pooled, which continued through 1950. By that point, World Series games could be seen in most of the country, but not all.\nOn July 12, 1949, CBS broadcast the All-Star Game from Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, New York. Red Barber, who was the primary broadcaster for the Brooklyn Dodgers at the time, provided play-by-play. Barber had already, by 1946, added to his Brooklyn duties a job as sports director of the CBS Radio Network, succeeding Ted Husing and continuing through 1955. There, his greatest contribution was to conceive and host the \"CBS Football Roundup\", which switched listeners back and forth between broadcasts of different regional college games each week.\nOn August 11, 1951, CBS' flagship television station WCBS-TV in New York City broadcast the first baseball game ever televised in color between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Braves from Ebbets Field, in which the Braves beat the Dodgers 8–1. As were all color programs at the time, it was transmitted via a field-sequential color system developed by CBS. Signals transmitted this way could not be seen on existing black-and-white sets. Four years prior on July 21, WCBS used a prototype version of the Zoomar Lens (the first commercially successful zoom lens) to cover a Brooklyn Dodgers/Cincinnati Reds game.\nLater that year, CBS televised Game 1 of the National League tie-breaker series between the Dodgers and the New York Giants. Red Barber and Connie Desmond called that particular game and John Derr served as a field reporter. The remaining two games (including the legendary \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" that ended Game 3 to send the Giants to the World Series) were broadcast by NBC with Ernie Harwell and Russ Hodges on the call.\nOriginal \"Major League Baseball on CBS\" program (1955–1965).\n1955–1958.\nBy , Dizzy Dean and the \"Game of the Week\" would move from ABC to CBS (the rights were actually set up through the Falstaff Brewing Corporation). \"CBS' stakes were higher\" said Buddy Blattner, who left the Mutual Broadcasting System to rejoin Dean. Ron Powers wrote about the reteaming of Dean and Blattner, \"they wanted someone who'd known Diz, could bring him out.\" Gene Kirby, who had worked with Dean and Blattner at Mutual and ABC, produced the telecasts and also filled in on announcing duties.\nBob Finnegan, who along with Bill McColgan had called backup games for ABC, performed the same role for CBS, working with a variety of color men including future \"Wide World of Sports\" host Jim McKay and future \"World News Tonight\" anchor Frank Reynolds.\nIn 1956, CBS Sports director Frank Chirkinian devised an earplug called an Intercepted Feed Back (or IFB) in order to connect the announcer, director, producer and thus, smoothing on-air flow.\nIn , CBS added a Sunday \"Game of the Week\". ABC's Edgar Scherick said \"In '53, no one wanted us. Now teams begged for \"Game\"'s cash.\" That year, the National Football League (NFL) began a US$14.1 million revenue-sharing pact. By , Major League Baseball ended the large-market blackout, got $6.5 million for exclusivity, and split the pot.\nWith CBS now carrying the \"Game of the Week\", the network's stations in Phoenix (KOOL-TV), Little Rock (KTHV) and Cedar Rapids (KGAN-TV) were finally receiving the broadcasts. Bud Blattner said \"America had never had TV network ball. Now you're getting two games a week [four, counting NBC, by ].\"\nIn , Dizzy Dean ruffled the feathers of CBS Sports head Bill MacPhail when he said \"I don't know how we come off callin' this the 'Game of the Week'. There's a much better game – Dodgers–Giants – over on NBC.\" Dean also once refused a Falstaff ad because the date was Mother's Day. When United Airlines backed CBS' \"Game of the Week\" telecasts, Dean – who hated to fly – said \"If you have to, pod-nuh, Eastern is much the best.\" That year, George Kell served as host for the pregame show. During one broadcast, Kell hoped to ask guest Casey Stengel about the Yankees' batting order. When asked about how it went, Kell said, \"Fine. But in our 15 minutes, Casey didn't get past the leadoff batter.\"\n1959–1963.\nJack Whitaker and Frankie Frisch announced the backup games from 1959 to 1961. They usually did games that took place in Philadelphia, New York City, Washington, D.C. or Baltimore. Whitaker once said in three years, he would only broadcast three innings because CBS would not switch away from Dizzy Dean. However, he said that he learned a lot of baseball just sitting next to Frisch. CBS had other backup crews for games featuring the Chicago Cubs and White Sox, Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds. In these cases, Bob Finnegan would handle the play-by-play duties with various analysts depending on the city. CBS did not have \"Game of the Week\" rights from any other ballparks in those years.\nPee Wee Reese replaced Blattner as Dean's partner in . That year, Jerry Coleman hosted the pregame show for CBS' \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts. A rather embarrassing incident for Coleman occurred when he was interviewing Cookie Lavagetto when the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" started. Coleman later said, \"Believe me, when the Anthem starts, I stop, whether I'm taping, talking, or eating a banana.\"\nIn 1962, CBS dropped the Sunday baseball \"Game of the Week\" once the NFL season started, dropping the option clause for affiliates to carry baseball or football in place since 1957.\nIn 1963 and 1964, viewers in San Francisco were unable to see certain baseball telecasts aired by CBS on KPIX-TV locally, although the games aired on stations in markets adjacent to the Bay Area. In 1963, KPIX pre-empted the July 13 game between the San Francisco Giants–Philadelphia Phillies (at 10:15 a.m.), and the Los Angeles Dodgers-Phillies game on July 14 (at 9:30 a.m.); in 1964, the station pre-empted the Kansas City Athletics–New York Yankees game on May 16 (at 10:45) and the Milwaukee Braves–St. Louis Cardinals game on May 17. All four games did air on NBC affiliate KSBW in Salinas, KXTV in Sacramento and ABC affiliate KHSL-TV in Chico (the games also aired on KOLO-TV in Reno, Nevada, however it joined the two July 1963 games in progress, at 10:25 and 9:55 a.m. on the respective dates).\n1964–1965.\nBy , CBS' Dean and Reese called games from Yankee Stadium, Wrigley Field, St. Louis, Philadelphia and Baltimore. The New York Yankees got a $550,000 share of CBS' $895,000. Six clubs that exclusively played nationally televised games on NBC were paid $1.2 million. The theme music used on the CBS telecasts during this era was a Dixieland styled rendition of \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\".\nIn , the New York Yankees, which in the year prior played 21 \"Games of the Week\" for CBS (which had actually just purchased the Yankees), joined NBC's television package. The new package under NBC called for 28 games compared to the 123 aired across the three networks in 1960.\nAnnouncers.\nPlay-by-play\nColor commentators\nHosts/field reporters\nThe dark years (1966–1989).\nAs previously alluded to, on October 19, 1966, NBC signed a three-year contract with Major League Baseball. NBC paid roughly US$6 million per year for the 25 \"Games of the Week\", $6.1 million for the 1967 World Series and All-Star Game, and $6.5 million for the 1968 World Series and 1968 All-Star Game. In replacing CBS, NBC traded a circus for a seminar. Pee Wee Reese said \"Curt Gowdy was its guy (1966–75), and didn't want Dizzy Dean – too overpowering. Curt was nice, but worried about mistakes. Diz and I just laughed.\" Falstaff Brewery hyped Dean as Gowdy in return said \"I said, 'I can't do \"Wabash Cannonball.\" Our styles clash --\" then came Pee Wee Reese. Gowdy added by saying about the pairing between him and Reese, \"They figured he was fine with me, and they'd still have their boy.\" To many, baseball meant CBS's 1955–64 \"Game of the Week\" thoroughbred.\nIn 1976, CBS Radio replaced NBC Radio as the exclusive national radio broadcaster for the World Series and All-Star Game. This came after NBC ended its radio association with baseball in order to clear space for its 24-hour \"News And Information\" service programming. In , CBS Radio started broadcasting a weekly \"Game of the Week\". CBS Radio usually did two games each Saturday, one on the afternoons and another during the evenings. Typically, CBS' markets aired only the afternoon broadcasts. The games covered varied from the ones NBC-TV were offering at the time to games outside of NBC's sight.\nIn 1987, CBS broadcast the Pan American Games for the fourth and to date, final time. For the baseball coverage, John Dockery handled the play-by-play with Mark Marquess on color commentary. One year later, CBS broadcast the championship game for the College World Series. Brent Musburger served as the play-by-play announcer that year as well as in 1989. Joining Musburger in the booth was Rick Monday in 1988 and Joe Morgan in 1989.\n1990–1993 version.\nBy the end of the 1987-88 season, CBS finished in last place and was looking to get themselves out of the slump that they had gotten themselves into. They decided that sports would be a very powerful tool to put CBS back on the map. So on that end, they paid a huge sum of money to broadcast Major League Baseball.\nOn December 14, 1988, CBS (under the guidance of Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, Major League Baseball's broadcast director Bryan Burns, CBS Inc. CEO Laurence Tisch as well as CBS Sports executives Neal Pilson and Eddie Einhorn) paid approximately US$1.8 billion (equivalent to billion in ) for exclusive over-the-air television rights for over four years (beginning in 1990). CBS paid about $265 million each year for the World Series, League Championship Series, All-Star Game, and the Saturday \"Game of the Week\". CBS replaced ABC (which had broadcast Monday and later Thursday night baseball games from 1976 to 1989) and NBC (which had broadcast Major League Baseball in some shape or form since 1947 and the \"Game of the Week\" exclusively since 1966) as the national broadcast network television home of Major League Baseball.\nIt was one of the largest agreements (to date) between the sport of baseball and the business of broadcasting. The cost of the deal between CBS and Major League Baseball was about 25% more than in the previous television contract with ABC and NBC. The deal with CBS was also intended to pay each team (26 in and then, 28 by ) $10 million a year. The network would also be paying an estimated $7.1 million per game or $790,000 per inning, and $132,000 per out; a separate cable television deal would bring each team an additional $4 million. Each team could also cut its own deal with broadcast and cable television channels and radio stations to serve as their local broadcasters (for example, the New York Yankees signed a cable deal with MSG that would pay the team $41 million annually for 12 years). Reportedly, after the huge television contracts with CBS and ESPN were signed, baseball clubs spent their excess millions on free agent players.\nAuthor and presidential speechwriter Curt Smith however, said that Major League Baseball's deal with CBS Sports was \"sportscasting's Exxon Valdez.\" Had baseball valued national promotion provided by the \"Game of the Week\", said Smith, it never would have crafted a fast-bucks plan that has cut off the widest viewership. \"It's an obscene imbalance\", Smith also said, \"to have 175 games going to 60 percent of the country [in reference to Major League Baseball's corresponding cable deal with ESPN, which at the time was only available in about 60% of the country] and 16 games going to the rest.\" He added: \"Baseball has paid a grievous price for being out of sight and out of mind. It's attacked the lower and middle classes that forms baseball's heart. . . . In the end, the advertising community has come to view baseball as a leper.\"\nOne possible key factor towards why NBC lost the baseball package to CBS was due to their commitment to broadcasting the 1992 Summer Olympics from Barcelona. Two weeks prior to the announcement of the baseball deal with CBS, NBC had committed itself to paying $401 million for U.S. broadcast rights to the 1992 Summer Olympics. After the baseball deal was announced, some skeptics surmised that CBS had lowballed the Barcelona bidding so that it would have at least $1 billion to spend on baseball.\nAccording to industry insiders, neither NBC nor ABC wanted the entire baseball package—that is, regular-season games, both League Championship Series and the World Series—because such a commitment would have required them to preempt too many highly rated prime time shows. Thus, ABC and NBC bid thinking that two of the networks might share postseason play again or that one of the championship series might wind up on cable. Peter Ueberroth had encouraged the cable idea, but after the bids were opened, NBC and ABC found to their chagrin that he preferred network exposure for all postseason games. Only CBS, with its weak prime time programming, dared go for that.\nBefore the previous television contract (which ran from to ) with Major League Baseball was signed, CBS was at one point, interested in a pact which would have called for three interleague games airing only on Thursday nights during the season. The proposed deal with CBS involved respectively American League East teams playing the National League East, and the American League West playing the National League West. At the end of their coverage of the 1989 World Series, ABC commentator Al Michaels said:\nTrademarks.\nA trademark of CBS' baseball coverage was its theme music, composed by Bob Christianson and Tony Smythe. One writer in 2015, noting that CBS' coverage of that era was considered by many fans to be \"low-quality\", remarked that the majestic, mature, and soaring theme music could be considered \"the best part of CBS’ baseball coverage\". Besides the prologues (with the play-by-play announcer previewing the upcoming matchup) for the Saturday \"Game of the Week\", the music was usually set to the opening graphic of an opaque rendition of the CBS Eye entering a big, waving red, white and blue bunting and then a smaller, unfolding red, white and blue bunting (over a white diamond) and floating blue banner (which usually featured an indicating year like for instance, \"1991 World Series\") complete with dark red Old English text. Pat O'Brien was made the host of the All-Star Game, the postseason, and the World Series, despite having watched, by his own admission, a total of \"perhaps two\" baseball games in his entire life at that point.\nThe network used the slogan \"Baseball's biggest moments are on CBS!\" to promote its regular season \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts.\nOther music.\nFor Pat O'Brien's prologue for Game 3 of the 1990 National League Championship Series, between the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates, CBS used David Arkenstone's \"Desert Ride\", which would subsequently be used during Bob Costas' prologue for NBC's coverage of Game 6 of the 1993 NBA Finals between the Chicago Bulls and Phoenix Suns.\nDuring the closing credits of CBS' coverage of Game 4 of the 1990 World Series (after the Cincinnati Reds swept the Oakland Athletics), CBS used James Horner's score from the end credits of the 1989 film \"Glory\".\nA recurring theme during CBS' coverage of the postseason was the usage of Michael Kamen's \"Overture\" from \"\". From start to finish, an audio montage of baseball's most memorable moments played over it, followed by a video and music (with no narration) recap of both League Championship Series and the World Series from to . The \"Training\" cue from \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" was played against an all slow-motion montage of the entire series. As Tim McCarver recapped the first six games of the 1991 World Series before Game 7, CBS used Hans Zimmer's \"Fighting 17th\" from the movie \"Backdraft\" for the soundtrack.\nDuring Pat O'Brien's prologue for CBS' coverage of the 1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Ennio Morricone's theme from the 1987 film \"The Untouchables\" was used. CBS previously used this particular theme for the prologue of their 1990 National League Championship Series coverage. NBC would subsequently use Morricone's theme during the closing credits for their coverage of Game 6 of the 2000 American League Championship Series (the network's final Major League Baseball broadcast for the next 22 years).\nDuring Pat O'Brien's prologue for Game 1 of the 1991 American League Championship Series between the Minnesota Twins and Toronto Blue Jays and Dick Stockton's prologue for Game 5 of the 1992 American League Championship Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Oakland Athletics, CBS used \"In Celebration of Man\" by Yanni, which is now known for being the theme music for NBC's U.S. Open golf coverage. Also during CBS' 1992 ALCS coverage, CBS enlisted the cast of \"Sesame Street\" such as Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch and Telly Monster to help with the intros.\nDuring the 1993 All-Star Game and postseason, highlights of past All-Star Games and postseason moments were scored using the John Williams composed theme from the movie \"Jurassic Park\". Also during the commercial breaks of the 1993 All-Star Game, CBS provided a snippet of Don Henley's \"The Boys of Summer\". Van Halen's \"Right Now\" was used during the opening for the network's coverage of Game 4 of the 1993 American League Championship Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Chicago White Sox.\nDuring the prologue for Game 1 of the 1993 World Series, CBS used Hans Zimmer's \"The Walk Home\" from the movie \"Cool Runnings\". During the prologue for Game 6 of the 1993 World Series (CBS' final Major League Baseball telecast to date), they used Jerry Goldsmith's \"Tryouts\" from the movie \"Rudy\". Meanwhile, during the closing credits for Game 6 of the 1993 World Series, they used Bob Seger's \"The Famous Final Scene\" followed by Billy Joel's \"Famous Last Words\".\nYear-by-year.\nCBS for the most part, bypassed the division and pennant races. Instead, its schedule focused on games featuring major-market teams, regardless of their record.\n1990.\nMajor League Baseball's four-season tenure with CBS (–) was marred by turmoil and shortcomings throughout. The original plan was for Brent Musburger to be the lead play-by-play announcer for CBS' baseball telecasts (thus, having the tasks of calling the All-Star Game, National League Championship Series, and World Series), with veteran broadcaster and lead CBS Radio baseball voice Jack Buck to serve as the secondary announcer (which would involve calling a second weekly game and the American League Championship Series). Former ABC color commentator Tim McCarver was hired by CBS to be Musburger's partner while NBC's Jim Kaat was hired to be Buck's. However, weeks before CBS was to debut its MLB coverage, on April 1, 1990, Musburger was fired by the network over what CBS perceived to be a power grab by Musburger in taking on the assignment (at the time, Musburger was CBS' lead college basketball announcer, host of \"The NFL Today\", and was the main studio host for the NBA and had felt that he had been given too many broadcasting assignments by the network).\nWith Musburger's firing, Buck was moved up to the lead broadcast team alongside McCarver. His position as backup announcer alongside Kaat was taken by CBS' lead NBA announcer, Dick Stockton. Studio host Greg Gumbel took over for Stockton as the secondary play-by-play announcer in . Gumbel was in return, replaced by Andrea Joyce, who served as a field reporter for the first three seasons of CBS' coverage. On the teaming of Buck and McCarver, \"Broadcasting\" magazine wrote \"The network has exclusivity, much rides on them.\" Joining the team of Buck and McCarver was Lesley Visser (who was, incidentally, married to the aforementioned Dick Stockton), became the first woman to cover the World Series in 1990. It was initially speculated that Dick Stockton would not have been available to contribute as the secondary play-by-play announcer due to his football and basketball commitments for CBS.\nIn the interim between Brent Musburger's firing and Jack Buck's promotion, there had been speculation that if Al Michaels won an arbitration case involving ABC, he would join CBS as its lead baseball announcer. Michaels had been feuding with the network over an alleged violation of company policy. Michaels' contract with ABC was originally set to expire in late 1992. Ultimately however, ABC announced a contract extension that sources said would keep Michaels at ABC through at least the end of 1995 and would pay him at least $2.2 million annually with the potential to earn more. That would make Michaels the highest-paid sports announcer in television.\nMeanwhile, Jim Kaat earned rave reviews for his role as CBS' backup analyst (which flashed a considerable \"good-guy air\"). Ron Bergman wrote of Kaat's performance during the 1990 ALCS, \"This was a night for pitchers to excel. Dave Stewart. Roger Clemens. Jim Kaat [on commentary].\" Despite the rave reviews, Jim Kaat admitted that he was frustrated. He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead \"NFL on CBS\" color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes into the booth he felt compelled to use them and would \"force\" something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said \"Then John told me if he did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank. And if it is important it will come out. If it doesn't, it probably wasn't that important.\"\nA mildly notorious moment came during CBS' coverage of the 1990 All-Star Game from Wrigley Field in Chicago. In a game that was marred by rain delays for a combined 85 minutes (including a 68-minute monsoon during the 7th inning), CBS annoyed many diehard fans by airing the William Shatner-hosted reality series \"Rescue 911\" during the delay.\nRegular season.\nOn April 7, CBS aired a special program called \"Season of Dreams: Baseball 1990\". Hosted by Greg Gumbel, the special not only previewed the 1990 Major League Baseball season, but also CBS' upcoming baseball coverage in general. Joining Gumbel were CBS Sports analyst Tim McCarver and Pat O'Brien, who presented a segment on the numerous player transitions, leading up to the start of the 1990 season.\nCBS initially did not want to start their 1990 coverage until after the network had aired that year's NBA Finals (which was the last time CBS aired the Finals before the NBA's move to NBC). Therefore, only 12 regular season telecasts were scheduled The broadcasts would have been on each Saturday from June 16 through August 25 and a special Sunday telecast on the weekend of August 11–12 (the New York Yankees against the Oakland Athletics in Oakland on both days). Ultimately, four more telecasts were added – two in April and two on the last two Saturdays of the season.\nOn September 22, CBS was scheduled to televise a game between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees from Yankee Stadium at 12 p.m. Eastern Time. The start of game was however, delayed for approximately, five hours due to rain. Instead, CBS broadcast the St. Louis Cardinals–Pittsburgh Pirates game from Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh in the national window at noon. Following their baseball coverage, CBS was scheduled to broadcast a college football game between the Alabama Crimson Tide and Georgia Bulldogs at 3 p.m. EST. Consequently, CBS was unable to televise the Boston–New York game once the rain finally ceased just around 5:30 p.m. EST.\nPostseason.\nThe 1990 postseason started on a Thursday, while World Series started on a Tuesday due to the brief lockout. Major League Baseball and CBS went with some rather unconventional scheduling during the LCS round, with two consecutive scheduled off-days in the NLCS after Game 2.\nAfter NBC lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS, the network aggressively counter-programmed CBS' postseason baseball coverage with made-for-TV movies and miniseries geared towards female viewers.\nCBS' first year of Major League Baseball postseason coverage in general, proved to be problematic for the network. First and foremost, none of the teams involved in the ALCS (Boston and Oakland), NLCS (Cincinnati and Pittsburgh), and World Series (Cincinnati and Oakland) involved teams from baseball's largest media markets. This more than likely, helped reduce playoff ratings by 9.4% for prime time games and 3.4% for weekend daytime games. This was below the levels of the playoffs the year before, when they aired on NBC.\nWhile the ratings for the 1990 World Series improved to 26.2 compared to 1989, the 1989 Series (which aired on ABC) was interrupted for 10 days by the Loma Prieta earthquake. All in all, the 1989 World Series was at the time, the lowest rated World Series ever. More to the point, the ratings for the 1990 World Series on CBS were significantly lower than any World Series between 1982 and 1988.\nAlthough the 1990 NLCS lasted six games, that year's ALCS and more importantly, the World Series, lasted only four out of seven possible games. To put things into proper perspective, by one estimate, CBS lost $5 million for each playoff game not played and US$15.4 million for each World Series game not played. At the end of the day, CBS lost $12 million to $15 million on each of the League Championship Series and World Series games not played, for a total of $36 million to $45 million.\n1991.\nCBS claimed to have lost about $55 million on its baseball coverage in after-taxes revenue in 1990. The losses eventually totaled $170 million by the end of the four-year contract. The losses were partially due to a shorter-than-usual postseason, which ended when the Cincinnati Reds swept the defending World Champion Oakland Athletics in the World Series in four games. CBS made several adjustments for 1991. Regular season telecasts were reduced to a meager handful. In return, pregame shows during the League Championship Series were eliminated, to minimize the ratings damage.\nOn Sunday, May 5, CBS broadcast games involving Cleveland at Oakland (with Jack Buck and Tim McCarver on the call) and Boston at the Chicago White Sox (with Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat on the call). On Sunday, July 14, Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat called a game in Anaheim between the New York Yankees and California Angels.\nFor CBS' coverage of the 1991 All-Star Game from Toronto, CBS started their broadcast at the top of the hour with the customary pregame coverage. Because American President George H.W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney were throwing out the first ball, there was a slight delay from the 8:30 p.m. EDT start. The game eventually started about 15–20 minutes late. CBS began starting the prime time broadcasts at 8:30 for the final two years of the contract, with little or no pregame content.\nIn the 1991 World Series between the Minnesota Twins and Atlanta Braves, four games were won during the teams' final at-bat, and three of these, including the seventh and decisive game, were in extra innings. In the sixth game, Jack Buck famously called Minnesota left fielder Kirby Puckett's game-winning home run off of Charlie Leibrandt with the line \"And we'll see you tomorrow night!\" Ultimately, the tightly contested, seven-game affair between Minnesota and Atlanta earned CBS the highest ratings for a World Series since the 1986 World Series between the New York Mets and Boston Red Sox on NBC. In Washington, D.C., Game 7 of the 1991 World Series was pushed aside to independent station WDCA 20 so that CBS' WUSA 9 could air the Washington Redskins' NFL game against the New York Giants. Meanwhile, CBS' affiliate in Minneapolis, WCCO 4, had to miss the beginning of the pregame show for Game 7 because an NFL contest that CBS broadcast between the Minnesota Vikings and Phoenix Cardinals ended late.\nEarlier in the postseason, CBS' coverage of the ALCS meant that they could not carry the live testimony of Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation to the United States Supreme Court was put into question because of charges of sexual harassment from former staffer Anita Hill. Meanwhile, ABC, NBC, CNN and PBS all carried the testimony.\nAs previously mentioned, as CBS' baseball coverage progressed, the network dropped its 8:00 p.m. pregame coverage (in favor of airing sitcoms such as \"Evening Shade\"), before finally starting their coverage at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The first pitch would generally arrive at approximately 8:45 p.m. Perhaps as a result, Joe Carter's World Series clinching home run off Mitch Williams in 1993, occurred at 12 a.m. on the East Coast.\nSean McDonough replaces Jack Buck.\nAfter two years of calling baseball telecasts for CBS, Jack Buck was dismissed in December 1991. According to the radio veteran Buck, he had a hard time adjusting to the demands of a more constricting television production. CBS felt that Buck should have done more to make himself appear to be a set-up man for lead analyst Tim McCarver. Buck was also criticized for miscalls and anticipating the outcome of plays. Jack Buck's son Joe tried to rationalize his father's on-air problems by saying \"My dad was brought up in the golden age of radio, I think he had his hands tied somewhat, being accustomed to the freedom of radio. I'm more used to acquiescing to what the producer wants to do, what the director wants to do.\"\nRic LaCivita, CBS' coordinating producer for baseball, said in July 1992 in regards to working with Jack Buck for two seasons \"There were different styles in the booth that made it difficult to create the type of production that benefited from Tim's skills. My job is to create an atmosphere where our people can do the best job, with people talking in the truck and an announcer who was doing radio calls instead of TV calls.\"\nBuck himself sized up CBS' handling of the announcers by saying \"CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let [analyst Tim] McCarver run the show.' In television, all they want you to do is shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up.\" Buck though, would add that although he knew Tim McCarver well, they never developed a good relationship with each other on the air despite high hopes to the contrary. Phil Mushnick added insult to injury to Buck by accusing him of \"trying to predict plays, as if to prove he was still on top.\"\nBuck also got into deep trouble with CBS executives (namely executive producer Ted Shaker) over questionable comments made towards singer Bobby Vinton in 1990. While on-air prior to Game 4 of that year's NLCS in Pittsburgh, Buck criticized Vinton's off-key rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", making a comment towards Vinton that sounded like a prejudicial remark centered on his Polish heritage. Joe Buck believed that the situation was ironic because his father was \"trying to help the guy.\" Buck began receiving death threats from Pirate fans and discovered a footprint on his pillow once he returned to his hotel room.\n1992.\nBuck's replacement was Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Ted Shaker called McDonough about his interests for the top announcing job, and after McDonough hung up the telephone, he claimed that he did not want to \"act like a 10-year-old\" but he \"jumped so high that he put a hole in his ceiling.\" McDonough, who was 30 years old at the time, became the youngest full-time network announcer to call a World Series when he called that year's Fall Classic alongside McCarver.\nFor CBS' coverage of the 1992 All-Star Game, they introduced Basecam, a lipstick-size camera, inside first base.\nThroughout Game 2 of the 1992 ALCS, Jim Kaat was stricken with a bad case of laryngitis. As a result, Johnny Bench had to come over from the CBS Radio booth and finish the game with Dick Stockton as a \"relief analyst.\" There was talk that if Kaat's laryngitis did not get better, Don Drysdale was going to replace Kaat on television for the rest of ALCS, while Bench would continue to work on CBS Radio.\nTim McCarver ran afoul of Atlanta Braves outfielder Deion Sanders during the 1992 postseason, when he made comments on-air criticizing Sanders for his two-sport athletic career; Sanders was playing for both the Braves and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons at the time and participated in both the baseball postseason and the early NFL regular season for the first time in 1992 (Sanders was unable to do this in 1991, as his NFL contract with the Falcons would not allow him to). Sanders retaliated following Game 7 of the NLCS by dumping a bucket of ice water on McCarver (who was wired for sound and feared electrocution).\nHe was not immune to criticism from outside sources, either, as Norman Chad wrote a critique of him in \"Sports Illustrated\" during the postseason. Chad said that McCarver was someone who \"when you ask him the time, will tell you how a watch works\", a reference to McCarver's perceived tendency to overanalyze things. Chad went further by saying \"What's the difference between Tim McCarver and appendicitis? Appendicitis is covered by most health plans.\"\nHe was also known to make gaffes from time to time. One of his more amusing miscues came during the 1992 National League Championship Series when he repeatedly referred to Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Tim Wakefield as \"Bill Wakefield. He finally explained that Bill Wakefield was one of his old minor-league teammates, and he laughed at himself because \"I forgot my own name!\" The year prior, during Game 6 of the World Series, McCarver's broadcast colleague, Jack Buck talked about Atlanta third baseman Terry Pendleton, who hit .367 in the series. Buck said, \"TP. That's what his teammates call him.\" A few seconds later, McCarver rather oddly added, \"TP. An appropriate name for someone who plays on the Braves.\"\nDuring the 1992 postseason, CBS missed covering one of the three debates among U.S. presidential candidates George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton. and H. Ross Perot. CBS had planned to join other broadcast and cable networks in the telecast; however, Game 4 of the ALCS between the Toronto Blue Jays and Oakland Athletics did not end until 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time, about the time the debate ended. The Blue Jays won the game 7–6 in 11 innings. The other networks reported very good ratings for the debate, part of one of the more compelling election campaigns in recent times.\nThe 1992 NLCS between the Atlanta Braves and Pittsburgh Pirates meanwhile, ended in dramatic fashion; in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7, with Atlanta down 2–1 and the bases loaded, the Braves' Francisco Cabrera cracked a two-run single that scored David Justice and Sid Bream. Bream famously slid to score the Series-winning run, beating the throw by Pirates left fielder Barry Bonds. Don Ohlmeyer, the former head of NBC Sports and President of NBC West Coast, supposedly called the event \"one of the most exciting baseball moments he had ever seen,\" albeit regretting the time of day it took place.\nRegular season.\nFor the 1992 season, CBS chose from three games on most Saturdays, thus giving them more flexibility. The Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Red Sox, Atlanta Braves, and Los Angeles Dodgers all agreed to increase their maximum number of network exposures before the final two weeks of the season from four to five. This would've been when any scheduled game was eligible for broadcast. More to the point, with two or three matchups tentatively scheduled for each date, CBS had the option to select the best game two weeks before the telecast. For instance, the Red Sox could appear on CBS as many as five times, the New York Mets four times, and the New York Yankees once.\n1993.\nOn May 22, 1993, WIVB 4, CBS' affiliate in Buffalo, New York, bypassed CBS' Saturday afternoon baseball coverage for the second consecutive week. According to a CBS spokesperson, the King World owned Channel 4 was the only affiliate in the country to drop baseball the previous Saturday and would be the only affiliate to skip May 22's game, too. WIVB in baseball's place, ran paid programming. Channel 4's Twila Henneberger said \"We're not carrying the games this month and we're looking at them on an individual basis after that. There is minimal interest in viewership of baseball, plus a lot of opportunities to watch all week and during the evenings. Interest on part of the advertisers is not there, either.\" Their decision to drop baseball for two weeks came about a week after CBS appeared to fail in its bid to keep the sport after the 1993 season.\nLesley Visser missed the first half of the 1993 season due to injuries earlier suffered in a bizarre jogging accident in New York City's Central Park. Visser broke her hip and skidded face-first across the pavement, requiring reconstructive plastic surgery on her face and more than a decade later required an artificial hip replacement. She missed the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Jim Kaat would replace her while she recuperated. Jim Gray also served as a reporter for the All-Star Game and World Series.\nAs previously mentioned, for 1993, CBS made a broadcast booth change by removing Dick Stockton from his role as secondary play-by-play announcer after three seasons, and replacing him with Greg Gumbel. Also as previously mentioned, also during the 1993 season, Andrea Joyce replaced Gumbel as studio host. Joyce would be joined at the anchor desk by Pat O'Brien. At the 1993 World Series, she became the first woman to co-host the network television coverage for a World Series. Sean McDonough filled in for O'Brien, who was suffering from laryngitis, as the pregame host for Game 6 of the 1993 National League Championship Series. Game 6 of the NLCS by the way, didn't have its first pitch until nearly 8:50 p.m. EST so that CBS could run \"60 Minutes\" in its entirety.\nDuring CBS' coverage of the World Series, umpires were upset with the overhead replays being televised by CBS. Dave Phillips, the crew chief, said just prior to Game 2 that the umpires want \"CBS to be fair with their approach.\" Rick Gentile, senior vice president for production for CBS Sports, said that Richie Phillips, the lawyer for the Major League Umpires Association, tried to call the broadcast booth during Saturday's game, but the call was not put through. Richie Phillips apparently was upset when Dave Phillips called the Philadelphia Phillies' Ricky Jordan out on strikes in the fourth inning, and a replay showed the pitch to be about 6 inches outside. National League President Bill White, while using a CBS headset in the broadcast booth during Game 1, was overheard telling Gentile and the producer Bob Dekas, \"You guys keep using that camera the way you want. Don't let Phillips intimidate you.\"\nThe end of \"Major League Baseball on CBS\".\nAfter the fallout from CBS' financial problems from their exclusive, four-year-long, US$1.8 billion television contract with Major League Baseball (a contract that ultimately cost the network approximately $500 million), Major League Baseball decided to go into the business of producing the telecasts themselves and market these to advertisers on its own. Therefore, in May 1993, Major League Baseball officially announced a revenue sharing agreement with ABC and NBC that would call for Major League Baseball to receive 85% of the first US$140 million in advertising revenue (or 87.5% of advertising revenues and corporate sponsorship from the games until sales topped a specified level), 50% of the next $30 million, and 80% of any additional money. Prior to this, Major League Baseball was projected to take a projected 55% cut in rights fees and receive a typical rights fee from the networks. When compared to the previous television deal with CBS, The Baseball Network was supposed to bring in 50% less of the broadcasting revenue. The advertisers were reportedly excited about the arrangement with The Baseball Network because the new package included several changes intended to boost ratings, especially among younger viewers.\nThe final Major League Baseball game that CBS has televised to date was Game 6 of the 1993 World Series on October 23. Before Major League Baseball decided to seek the services of other networks, CBS offered US$120 million in annual rights fees over a two-year period, as well as advertising revenues in excess of $150 million a season.\nUpon being asked about the news of CBS having to end their relationship with Major League Baseball after only four years, Sean McDonough told the \"New York Times\" \"It's all the words you can think of, frustrating, disappointing and sad, particularly because it's going so well. Hopefully, this will just be a cyclical thing and we can get back into it, maybe in two years.\" When Toronto's Joe Carter hit his 1993 World Series clinching home run off of Philadelphia Phillies closer Mitch Williams, McDonough said \"Well-hit down the left-field line! Way back and GONE! Joe Carter with a three-run homer! The winners and still world champions, the Toronto Blue Jays!\"\nShortly after the start of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Stanford University's Roger Noll argued that the Baseball Network deal (and the bargain-basement ESPN cable renewal, which went from $100 million to $42 million because of their losses) reflected \"poor business judgment on the part of management about the long-run attractiveness of their product to national broadcasters.\" He added that the $140 million that owners expected to share for the 1994 season (before the strike) from TBN was underestimated by \"one-third to one-half\" and fell below the annual average of $165 million needed to renew the TBN deal after two years. Meanwhile, Andy Zimbalist, author of \"Baseball and Billions\", and a players' union consulting economist, insisted that baseball \"could have done better than the TBN deal with some combination of CBS (which as previously mentioned, offered $120 million last-ditch bid for renewal), Fox and TBS. Baseball shut out CBS and could have waited longer before closing them out.\"\nIn October , when it was a known fact that ABC and NBC were going to end their television deal/joint venture with Major League Baseball, preliminary talks arose about CBS resuming its role as the league's national over-the-air broadcaster. It was rumored that CBS would show Thursday night games (more specifically, a package of West Coast inter-league games scheduled for the 11:30 p.m. Eastern/8:30 Pacific Time slot) while Fox would show Saturday afternoon games. CBS and Fox were also rumored to share rights to the postseason. At the time, CBS sports President David Kenin said in a statement, \"We are interested in all major sports properties and obviously Major League Baseball is one of them. If we can conceive an arrangement that makes sense, naturally we'd be very interested in acquiring some kind of baseball package.\" In the end however, CBS' involvement did not come to pass and NBC became Fox's over-the-air national television partner. Whereas each team earned about $14 million in 1990 under CBS, the later television agreement with NBC and Fox beginning in 1996 earned each team about $6.8 million.\nAftermath.\nAfter CBS' contract with Major League Baseball expired following the 1993 season, Tim McCarver returned to ABC (and to his broadcast partners prior to coming to CBS, Al Michaels and Jim Palmer) for the next two years under the short-lived \"Baseball Network\" joint-venture. After calling Games 1, 4–5 of the 1995 World Series for ABC (NBC's Bob Costas, Joe Morgan, and Bob Uecker called the other games), McCarver moved to Fox to form the lead broadcast team with Joe Buck. With the exception of 1997 and 1999 (when NBC held the broadcasting rights), McCarver would help broadcast every World Series from 1996 until his retirement from national TV broadcasts in 2013. Ten years prior to that, McCarver set a record by broadcasting his 13th World Series on national television (surpassing Curt Gowdy); in all, he called 24 Fall Classics for ABC, CBS, and Fox.\nMeanwhile, despite the loss of Major League Baseball, Sean McDonough stayed on at CBS Sports calling among other things, the College World Series. In fact, three years after calling Joe Carter's World Series clinching home run in Toronto, McDonough while calling the College World Series for CBS alongside Steve Garvey, McDonough called another series clinching home run. This time, it was Warren Morris, who hit a two out, 9th inning walk-off home run that won the 1996 College World Series for the Louisiana State University Fighting Tigers against Miami. Sean McDonough's run at CBS came to an end in December 1999, when CBS Sports President Sean McManus informed McDonough that his contract would not be renewed. Once Dick Enberg, late of NBC became available, McDonough basically became the odd man out. Since 2000, McDonough has announced baseball, college basketball, college football, NFL, NHL and NCAA hockey for ABC and ESPN. Specifically, McDonough announces many Big East college football and basketball events. McDonough also continued to announce local Red Sox broadcasts during this time, moving over the years to different local stations including WFXT (Channel 25), WABU (Channel 68) and WLVI (Channel 56). In 1996, he was teamed with former Red Sox second baseman Jerry Remy, with whom he worked for nine seasons before McDonough was replaced completely in 2005 by NESN announcer Don Orsillo. McDonough attributed his firing to his salary and disputed talk that his \"candor\" was to blame.\nIn 1994, Jim Kaat was the lead analyst on \"Baseball Tonight\" for ESPN's coverage of Major League Baseball. In 1995, he was nominated for a New York Emmy Award for \"On Camera Achievement.\" Also in , Kaat called the American League playoffs with Brent Musburger for ABC/The Baseball Network including the New York Yankees–Seattle Mariners Division Series. He served his second stint as an announcer for Yankees games on the MSG Network/YES Network (–), where his straight-shooting style was much in the mode of former Yankees broadcasters Tony Kubek and Bill White. Towards the end of his second stint with the Yankees, his workload decreased. In 2006, he only broadcast 65 games. Despite his decreased work load, Kaat won another Emmy for on-air achievement in 2006. In an on-air broadcast on September 10, with booth partner Ken Singleton, Kaat acknowledged his plan to end his broadcasting career. His final appearance in the booth was to be a New York Yankees–Boston Red Sox game on September 15, 2006 (Kaat was also set to throw out the first pitch). However, the game was postponed due to rain. Kaat later announced that he was going to record a special farewell message to the fans, but would not return for any additional broadcasts. However, the following day, Kaat did announce one full inning of the first game of Saturday September 16's doubleheader on Fox along with Tim McCarver and Josh Lewin. During that Fox telecast he was able to say goodbye to the Yankees fans, an opportunity that the previous night's rainout had deprived him of doing on the YES Network. In , Kaat joined the recently launched MLB Network as a color commentator for their \"MLB Network Showcase\" series. Kaat also writes a weekly on-line blog for the Yankees (YES) Network, Kaat's Korner, and contributes video blogs and interviews regularly with national and international media outlets. One of the reasons he got back into regular broadcasting was because after his wife died, Tim McCarver and Elizabeth Schumacher, his friend and business manager, urged him to get back into the game. He also called Pool D in Puerto Rico for the 2009 World Baseball Classic games for an international feed.\nGreg Gumbel moved to NBC in 1994 following CBS' losses of the NFL and Major League Baseball broadcasting contracts (Gumbel's last on-air assignment for CBS was providing play-by-play for the College World Series). While at NBC, Gumbel hosted NBC's coverage of the 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He also did play-by-play for the Major League Baseball National League Division Series and National League Championship Series (on both occasions, teaming with Joe Morgan), did play-by-play for \"The NBA on NBC\", hosted NBC's daytime coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympics from Atlanta, Georgia, hosted the 1995 World Championships of Figure Skating, and served as the studio host for \"The NFL on NBC\". Gumbel left NBC after the network broadcast of Super Bowl XXXII to return to CBS. His first major assignment was to serve as studio host for the network's coverage of college basketball, including the NCAA men's basketball tournament, something he continues to do to this day. Gumbel later resumed hosting \"The NFL Today\" on CBS before transitioning back to play-by-play duties.\nDick Stockton left CBS in 1994 for Fox Sports, which continues to employ him on NFL and Major League Baseball telecasts. For Fox's MLB coverage, he has worked with Eric Karros, Joe Girardi, Mark Grace and Tim McCarver and others. From 1993 to 1995, Stockton also called local TV broadcasts of the Oakland Athletics. From to 2013, Stockton called postseason Major League Baseball games on TBS. In 2007, he partnered with Ron Darling to call the National League Division Series for the network. In , he called the AL Central tiebreaker game with Darling and Harold Reynolds, followed by the NLDS with Darling and Tony Gwynn. In , he teamed with Bob Brenly to call the NLDS for TBS, and the two have worked together for the NLDS every year since until 2014, when TBS began carrying only two LDS, rotating between AL/NL each year. (TBS and Fox began splitting the LDS from 2014 on.) TBS was previously the exclusive home of the LDS from 2007 to 2013. Stockton split play-by-play duties during the regular season on TBS with \"NBA on TNT\" studio host Ernie Johnson Jr. and Milwaukee Brewers announcer Brian Anderson. In , he partnered with Ron Darling and John Smoltz to call Game 5 of National League Division Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies for TBS as his normal partner Brenly was away at a family event. After 2013, Stockton focused mainly on calling NFL games on Fox before retiring in 2021.\nOver the course of the 1990s, Jack Buck decided to reduce his schedule to calling only Cardinals home games (or 81 games a year unless there was a special occurrence). Health concerns obviously could have played a factor in this, as Buck suffered from such ailments as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, requiring a pacemaker, cataracts, sciatica, and vertigo. Buck once joked, \"I wish I'd get Alzheimer's, then I could forget I've got all the other stuff.\" In 1998, the Cardinals dedicated a bust of Buck that showed him smiling with a hand cupping his left ear. In 1999, he lent his name to a restaurant venture called J. Buck's, with the restaurant's name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie. One of Buck's final public appearances was on September 17, 2001, at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis. It was the first night that Major League Baseball resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11. Although looking rather frail (Buck at the time was sick with lung cancer) and struggling to maintain his composure (Buck was obviously showing the signs of Parkinson's disease as well), Buck stirred emotions by reading a patriotic-themed poem during the pregame ceremonies. He concluded by silencing critics who thought baseball had come back too soon: \"I don't know about you, but as for me, the question has already been answered: Should we be here? Yes!\" Jack Buck died on June 18, 2002, in St. Louis's Barnes-Jewish Hospital from a combination of illnesses. He had stayed in the hospital since January 3 of that year to undergo treatment for lung cancer, Parkinson's disease, and to correct an intestinal blockage.\nReasons behind monetary losses.\nAs previously mentioned, in the end, CBS wound up losing approximately half a billion dollars from their television contract with Major League Baseball. CBS repeatedly asked Major League Baseball for a rebate, however the league was not willing to do this. According to Curt Smith's book \"The Voice – Mel Allen's Untold Story\", one CBS executive wore a St. Louis Cardinals cap at a 1988 Christmas party. However, by , pining to shed baseball, that same executive wore a cap styled \"One More Year.\"\nErratic scheduling.\nCBS alienated and confused fans with its sporadic treatment of regular season telecasts. With a sense of true continuity destroyed, fans eventually figured that they could not count on the network to satisfy their needs (thus, poor ratings were a result). CBS televised about 16 regular season Saturday afternoon games (not counting back-up telecasts) which was 14 less than what NBC televised during the previous contract. According to Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, the reason for the reduction in regular season telecasts was in order for teams to sell them locally in order to make a direct profit. CBS used the strategy of broadcasting only a select number of games in order to build a demand in response to supposedly sagging ratings. In theory, the limited regular season package would require the network to sell less advertising during the year so it can charge more for its postseason events.\nIn response to this, NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol grinned \"I assume [its] baseball strategy has to be a big disappointment.\" Counting the All-Star Game, both League Championship Series and the World Series, CBS would have televised just 38 games. This comes on the account of both League Championship Series and the World Series going to a full seven games. Ebersol criticized Peter Ueberroth for negotiating the four-year, $1.06 billion deal with CBS. According to Ebersol, Ueberroth was totally focused on business. Ebersol said \"Ueberroth wanted his legacy to be the maximum amount of money. Baseball got this enormous overbid with CBS, coupled with expanding the cable package (on ESPN) from zero to four nights a week. Now, when they find themselves in trouble, they've got no place to expand. There just wasn't a lot of foresight. (Baseball was) just looking for the big score.\"\nIn their first year in 1990, CBS Sports had a pretty loaded schedule (much came at the expense of the regular season baseball coverage): the NBA Playoffs (the 1989–90 season marked CBS' final year with the NBA before the over-the-air package moved over to NBC), College World Series, and college football (like the NBA, CBS would lose the College Football Association (CFA) package soon after being awarded the Major League Baseball contract).\nCBS never scheduled baseball on Masters weekend, and seldom on other weekends when it was scheduled to air a PGA Tour event. It was around this time that CBS started expanding its weekend coverage from two hours to three on weekends when there was no baseball, generally from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Most of its baseball dates landed on weeks when other networks covered golf.\nMarv Albert, who hosted for many years said about CBS' baseball coverage \"You wouldn't see a game for a month. Then you didn't know when CBS came back on.\" When interviewed by \"The New York Times\" in August 1989 Albert when asked, agreed with the notion regarding whether the average fan would be shut out of Major League Baseball with only 12 Saturday afternoon games being televised by CBS. He added that the then present major league regime might not have agreed to the same package. According to him, Major League Baseball, similar to the NBA, felt that limited exposure would be better for the game. In Albert's eyes, what CBS was doing was televising the regular season for the delight of carrying the All-Star Game, the playoffs, and the World Series.\n\"Sports Illustrated\" joked that CBS stood for \"Covers Baseball Sporadically\". \"USA Today\" added that Jack Buck and Tim McCarver \"may have to have a reunion before [their] telecast.\" Mike Lupica of the \"New York Daily News\" took it a step further by calling CBS' baseball deal \"the Vietnam of sports television.\"\nNBC play-by-play announcer Bob Costas believed that the fact that a large bulk of the regular season coverage ended up on cable (namely, ESPN) beginning in the 1990s was because CBS, when it took over the MLB the television rights from NBC in 1990, did not really want the Saturday \"Game of the Week\". Many fans who did not appreciate CBS' approach to scheduling regular season baseball games believed that they were only truly after the marquee events (namely, the All-Star Game, League Championship Series, and the World Series) in order to sell advertising space (especially the fall entertainment television schedule).\nCostas had previously said that he would rather do a \"Game of the Week\" that got a 5 rating than host a Super Bowl. \"Who thought baseball killed its best way to reach the public? It coulda kept us and CBS – we'd have kept the 'Game' – but it only cared about cash. Whatever else I did, I'd never have left 'Game of the Week' Costas claimed. Meanwhile, Tony Kubek, who teamed with Bob Costas on NBC's baseball telecasts since 1983, said \"I can't believe it!\" when the subject came about NBC losing baseball for the first time since 1947.\nThe Toronto Blue Jays factor.\nThe Toronto Blue Jays were in back-to-back World Series in their championship seasons of and , as well as the 1991 ALCS. All of CBS's postseason telecasts were simulcast on CTV (which earned CBS approximately $7.5 million per year) in Canada, and received very high ratings north of the border when the Blue Jays were involved. Unfortunately, Canada does not factor in the American Nielsen ratings so as a consequence, CBS earned the lowest U.S. ratings in over 20 years for a World Series (not counting the earthquake interrupted 1989 World Series that was televised by ABC). In any other World Series, viewership would have likely been higher since two American teams would have been involved, to say nothing of spikes to off-the-chart ratings shares in the two competing cities (especially in , when CBS was fortunate to cover the riveting, ultra intense, seven-game battle between the Minnesota Twins and Atlanta Braves). Another reason behind the poor ratings likely had to do with the gradual attrition of the audience for almost all network programming.\nUnlucky timing.\nThe country at the time to the deal was going through a recession. More to the point, in 1990, CBS had asked for about $300,000 for 30-second spots during the World Series, but ended up filling some of its inventory for just $240,000.\nCBS could not properly maximize the deal because the Division Series had not yet been created (thus automatically giving CBS more games to carry) and the network did not have a cable outlet to air some of the games (like Fox would eventually have with Fox Sports Net and later FS1). In reality, it competed with ESPN and local broadcasts outside of CBS' broadcast window. More postseason games could have increased the advertising inventory. Both ABC and NBC lost money on their in-season games the last three years of their respective Major League Baseball television contracts (–).\nIt should also be noted that CBS' baseball coverage came about just prior to the league making some major changes and innovations, beginning with the mid-1990s. Besides the aforementioned addition of a third round of postseason play called the Division Series, which doubled the number of playoff teams at the time from four to eight, there was also a renaissance in stadium construction. This began in , when Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards opened. Camden Yards (which was showcased by CBS in their final year with baseball in , when they broadcast the All-Star Game) led to many other fan (and revenue) friendly ballparks being built, and helped expand interest in the game. Instead, CBS was for the most part, handed a declining product that was played in many outdated cookie cutter stadiums.\nToo much money for one package.\nCBS simply made far too high of a bid (especially for a network that wound up frustrating fans with its lack of regular season coverage) and sustained a shortfall in advertising revenue. Perhaps it is somewhat ironic that back in , CBS Sports president Neal Pilson said of ABC's then ongoing contract with Major League Baseball \"Three years ago, we believed ABC's package was overpriced by $175 million. We still believe it's overpriced by $175 million.\" Whereas from 1976 to 1989, ABC split the television contract with NBC, and therefore logically, split the financial risks, CBS in sharp contrast, aggressively negotiated exclusive postseason rights. In December 1988, Arthur Watson, the president of NBC Sports, criticized CBS saying \"We made every effort to keep it. Regretfully, someone bid far more than was responsible. Everybody evaluates things differently. That bid was beyond our reach. Let them explain that bid.\"\nFor their inaugural season in 1990, CBS lost between US$75 million and $80 million More to the point, CBS as previously mentioned, took a $55-million after-tax loss for its 1990 playoff and World Series coverage and a $115 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter for losses during the remaining three years of its $1.06 billion contract.\nIn 1991, it cost CBS $4.8 million per game in venue productions alone to televise the National League Championship Series, not including studio backup operations or the satellite time needed to transmit the game to New York City for broadcast on their network frequencies. The American League Championship Series (between the Minnesota Twins and Toronto Blue Jays) was another problem because of the tariffs and labor laws they had to endure going into Canada. CBS averaged $1.9 to $2.4 million per regular season game. In return, it was typical for the production cost to double come playoff time. Ultimately, CBS reported a loss of around $169 million in the third quarter of 1991. A drop of in advertiser interest caused revenue from the sale of ads during CBS' baseball telecasts to plummet. All the while, CBS was still contractually obligated to pay Major League Baseball around $260 million a year through 1993.\nProduction overview.\nBack in 1990, when CBS first launched their baseball coverage, Major League Baseball according to CBS Sports senior producer Ed Goren, did not have any atmosphere for discussion on how to improve the game. They retorted to Goran by saying \"'This is the national pastime and it's fun the way it is.'\" CBS however, would secretly install microphones in bullpens after Major League Baseball turned down their request.\nWhen CBS broadcast the 1990 All-Star Game from Chicago's Wrigley Field, they arrived with four 48-foot vans, a 40-foot trailer, two 60-foot office trailers and a 48-foot maintenance vehicle; 18 cameras positioned around and moving about the ballpark. Rick Kogan of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote that while CBS' 1990 All-Star Game telecast did not display any grievous gaffes, on almost every level it was workmanlike to the point of being mundane.\nAfter Boston Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens was pulled out of a 1990 American League Championship Series game and Jim Gray interviewed him on CBS, MLB's public relations department was upset when they found out that CBS intended to run it before the game ended. CBS Sports executive producer Ted Shaker also recalled the time that MLB said that they went too far in regards to CBS experimenting with a tiny camera on an umpire's face mask. Come that year's World Series, CBS announced that they would have 16 cameras and 12 videotape machines ready to cover the moment.\nCBS all around, was criticized in 1990 for placing their cameras too tight in certain situations and not giving viewers a greater sense of what it is like to be at the ballpark. Ted Nathanson, who served as a director for NBC's coverage of postseason baseball before CBS bought the rights, said in regards to CBS' World Series coverage \"What they are doing is wrong, in my opinion. They are losing the relationship of the action by using too many close-ups when the ball is in play.\" For example, Nathanson noted that CBS would cover a ground ball to shortstop by first using a camera with a medium view from a high position and then switching to a similar camera position for a tight closeup. According to him \"By the time they cut to the close-up of the shortstop, he's thrown the ball already so it looks like a jump-cut. It's impossible for a director to cut that fast. It looks like a glitch.\" Nathanson suggested that CBS' high camera should have gradually tightened in on the shortstop and then pan toward first base as the ball is thrown. If there was something important to be shown in close-up, they would have it on replay.\nNathanson also criticized camera work in regards to when the ball was in the outfield and runners were circling the bases. He said that \"They cut to the baserunners and they are not getting the relationship of the ball being fielded and thrown to the bases. If you are not a TV director, you don't know exactly what's wrong, but you know something is not quite right.\" Harry Coyle, who was NBC's top baseball director from 1947-1988 and cited as writing the \"book\" on how to show baseball on television, agreed with Nathanson about the camera close-ups, but he thought that the overall effort has been good. Coyle said that CBS got in too tight once in a while. His premise had always been to follow the ball. But, on the whole, Coyle gave CBS high marks. He said that they were lucky they got the playoffs to do first so it gave them a lot of experience for the World Series.\nWhile Arne Harris, who produced and directed 150 Chicago Cubs games a season since 1964 for WGN Television, said that he had no problem with tight closeups, he still felt that CBS had trouble getting into the flow of the game. According to Harris, baseball is the toughest sport to cover because two things happen at the same time. The ball is in the hands of the defense and the runner is moving in a different part of the field. Harris added that he knew that CBS got some problems, but it is all a matter of experience.\nFor the 1991 postseason, CBS announced that they would be using up to 11 cameras in the League Championship Series and 14 for the World Series. According to producer Ric LaCivita, CBS' production division in its entirety had been impacted by a recession. So they had to do a telecast with less. To give you a better idea, during the 1991 regular season, CBS would've been unable to use a super-slow-motion camera behind home plate unlike during the League Championship Series and World Series. According to director Bob Fishman, the $250,000 camera (which was capable of capturing 90 frames per second) and tape machine that created the shots were a luxury item. Therefore, Game 1 of the American League Championship Series would mark the first time that they would be using it on baseball all year. It during the 1991 World Series that CBS unveiled Supervision, which was device that that used animation to show the flight and speed of a pitch.\nIn conjunction with Super Bowl XXVI on January 26, 1992, CBS unveiled a new network-wide graphics package for its sports coverage. With a few minor tweaks, the red, white, and blue graphic displays stayed in place until 1996, when CBS rolled out a new orange and yellow package.\nCBS was cited for failing to show Dwight Smith's game-winning double for the Chicago Cubs in their 1992 baseball opener on April 18 against the St. Louis Cardinals. During that same telecast, the camera was on St. Louis trainer camera was on Gene Gieselmann long before analyst Tim McCarver said his name. Meanwhile, the Cardinals' batting order was presented for the bottom of the first inning—a different version than had been presented a half-inning earlier. Play-by-play announcer Sean McDonough however, presented the new lineup without acknowledging it had changed.\nDuring an interview with Richard Sandomir of the \"New York Times\" on July 14, 1992, Ric LaCivita not only previewed what CBS had in store for their upcoming broadcast of that year's All-Star Game from San Diego, which would feature 16 cameras, imbedded in the first base bag (which would allow viewers to be able to see the runner dive back to the bag), and two in blimps, but responded to the various criticisms that CBS received concerning their postseason coverage from the year prior.\nOn the argument that CBS overused replays, including as many as 133 in Game 6 of the 1991 National League Championship Series, LaCivita said \"The number of replays has nothing to do with how you replay. You could use five or 500 and be right. . . . Replays re-create a play or keep the viewer's attention from going forward to something else. Viewers can't appreciate everything until the replays are over. If it's an ordinary replay, you don't replay it.\" When asked about why CBS cut to a tight, low first-base camera, rather than a higher, more inclusive shot, to cover Mark Lemke of the Atlanta Braves eluding Minnesota Twins catcher Brian Harper's tag to end Game 4 of the World Series, LaCivita said \"Joe Aceti\"—the director -- \"made the right cut. Jack Buck said the game was over. Joe made his decision to cover him coming low across the plate. The mistake started with the call. To this day, the executive producer\"—Ted Shaker -- \"and I disagreed. You saw it from five different angles until we could identify where Harper's elbow was.\" As for the criticism from Harry Coyle about over-replays and dubious angles, LaCivita responded by saying \"We've had extraordinary coverage of difficult plays that I'm not sure Mr. Coyle would have had. I don't know if they would have had the Lonnie Smith play in Game 7\"—in which he was decoyed by the Twins' Chuck Knoblauch -- \"because their cameras covered the ball and ours cover the baserunners. Those guys from the 50's weren't risk-takers. I'm a risk-taker.\"\nWhen assessing CBS' coverage of the 1992 postseason, Jerry Trecker of the \"Hartford Courant\" wrote that their baseball coverage was at its best pictorially. Trecker said that the usage of close-ups, although criticized in some quarters, was powerful and conveyed the game's tense moments better than any turn of an announcer's phrase. He went further by saying that a better selection of replays, including a judicious use of super slow-motion views, had elevated the network's coverage since it struggled in the first year of their contract. Trecker also made note that even though CBS had finally developed a fine sense of the rhythm of baseball come 1992, the network still occasionally spent too much time on irrelevant crowd shots. Not only that, but CBS in Trecker's eyes, didn't seem confident enough to let Sean McDonough and booth partner Tim McCarver roam and ramble through the game. Instead, there were too many graphics that had to be explained and too many \"little notes\" that somebody thought are important.\nWhereas CBS used six cameras for their regular season coverage by 1993, they planned on using 13 for that year's All-Star Game in Baltimore. CBS also planned to take advantage of the remote camera atop the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Warehouse at Camden Yards, that provided panoramic views on the Orioles' games that were broadcast on Home Team Sports. Producer Bob Dekas even wanted to put microphones on All-Star managers Cito Gaston of the American League and Bobby Cox of the National League. The audio wouldn't be live, but CBS still had to gain permission from Major League Baseball.\nSonny Dearth of the \"Daily Press\" wrote that while CBS' coverage of the 1993 baseball playoffs was insightful and generally good, he did note that the camera from center field and the one from high above the plate often didn't \"agree\" on whether some pitches were balls or strikes, thus confusing the viewer. Dearth also wondered why the director had to show Philadelphia Phillies first basemen John Kruk's ripped pants (with the camera focused below the belt) so many times in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series.\nPrior to the start of the 1993 World Series, CBS announced that they would use 14 cameras to cover the Series, including a controversial one located above the plate that was intended on providing excellent shots of the strike zone. Before Game 6 of the NLCS, CBS had discussions with National League president Bill White, who asked the network to only use the camera \"judiciously.\" This was after White had been approached by the Major League Umpires Association, which said the camera was being used to second-guess and \"show up\" the plate umpires' calls of balls and strikes.\nIn 2020, Ed Goren said to the \"New York Business Journal\" that in the four years that Major League Baseball was on CBS, the attitude of baseball was that they were America's game. They however according to Goren, lacked innovation; they fought innovation. By the time that Fox came on board in 1996, part of what they were looking for was innovation. Therefore, among the immediate changes Fox brought were the FoxBox, which showed the score, the runners on base and the count at all times; frequent and extreme close ups of players; and the use of a hard-rock, guitar-heavy theme music.\nAssociation with \"Major League Baseball on TBS\" and \"College Baseball on CBS\".\nOn the July 2, 2011 edition of \"CBS Sports Spectacular\", TBS' Atlanta-based Major League Baseball studio crew of Matt Winer, Dennis Eckersley, Cal Ripken Jr. and David Wells presented a 2011 Major League Baseball midseason report. This was followed by \"MLB 2011: Down the Stretch\", which aired on September 24. CBS Sports and Turner Sports have also partnered on coverage of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and in the past, on the Winter Olympics in 1992, 1994 and 1998. On August 29, 2012, \"The New York Times\" reported a potential alliance between CBS and TBS on a Major League Baseball television contract beginning in 2014. According to the \"Times\" report, CBS \"would most likely want only the All-Star Game and World Series,\" an arrangement almost similar to the one NBC had with Major League Baseball from 1996 to 2000. On September 19, 2012, \"Sports Business Daily\" reported that Major League Baseball would agree to separate eight-year television deals with Fox Sports and Turner Sports through the 2021 season.\nOn May 19, 2015, CBS Sports Network resurrected CBS Sports' Major League Baseball theme music for the first time since Game 6 of the 1993 World Series for the American Athletic Conference Championship. Under the terms of the package, CBS Sports Network would air three Houston Baseball games in 2015, as well as the first two contests of the 2015 American Athletic Conference Baseball Championship. Carter Blackburn provided play-by-play for all seven games of the package, while analyst duties would be handled Darryl Hamilton and Ray King along with Brandon Tierney.\nMajor League Baseball coverage on CBS' owned-and-operated television stations.\nWBZ-TV has aired local sporting events over the years, that have originated either in-house, or through NBC or CBS. Besides the Braves (from 1948 until the team moved to Milwaukee before the 1953 season) and the Red Sox (1948–1957, 1972–1974, and a handful of games in 2003 and 2004, along with certain games aired nationally on NBC from 1948 to 1989).\nAs previously mentioned, as an ABC station, WJZ-TV broadcast limited Baltimore Orioles games via ABC's MLB broadcast contract from 1976 to 1989.\nDuring the 1980s, KPIX was the flagship station for the Oakland Athletics baseball team (at times preempting or delaying CBS network shows for the live broadcasts), before the A's broadcasts moved to then-NBC affiliate KRON-TV the early 1990s; select A's and San Francisco Giants games were aired on KPIX from 1990 to 1993 as part of CBS' MLB broadcast contract.\nIn 2002, WCBS-TV acquired the over-the-air rights to New York Yankees baseball games, replacing Fox owned-and-operated station WNYW. The games, produced by the new YES Network, remained in the station until the 2004 season; the rights moved to UPN affiliate (now MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station) WWOR-TV beginning in 2005. It also aired any Yankee or Met games as part of CBS' MLB broadcast contract from 1990 to 1993."

        "title": "Joe Morgan (baseball manager)",
        "text": "Joseph Michael Morgan (born November 19, 1930) is an American former infielder, manager, coach and scout in Major League Baseball.\nEarly life.\nA native and lifelong resident of Walpole, Massachusetts, Morgan graduated from Walpole High School and attended Boston College, where he played varsity hockey—he was a center who led the Eagles in points as a junior—as well as baseball. Morgan was also elected as team captain for Boston College's baseball team during his junior year. He signed his first professional baseball contract on June 20, 1952, with his then-hometown National League team, the Boston Braves.\nPlaying career.\nMorgan stood tall and weighed during his active career. When he made Major League Baseball at age 28 in , after military service and a stint in the minor leagues, his parent team had become the Milwaukee Braves.\nA left-handed-hitting second baseman, third baseman and outfielder, Morgan batted over the .300 mark three times in the high minors between 1956 and 1959. He could not, however, crack the Braves' lineup, nor those of the Philadelphia Phillies, Kansas City Athletics, Cleveland Indians and St. Louis Cardinals. In parts of four Major League seasons, he appeared in 88 games, collected 36 hits, and batted .193. His two MLB home runs came during his stint with the 1960 Indians within a two-week period, as he hit solo shots off Chuck Estrada August 30 and Ted Sadowski on September 10. In the latter contest, Morgan's three hits and two runs scored helped the Indians to a 5–4 victory over the Washington Senators.\nIn 13 seasons in the minor leagues, Morgan had 1,353 hits (with 117 home runs) and compiled a lifetime batting mark of .278. He was named Most Valuable Player of the Triple-A International League in 1964 after batting .290 with 16 home runs for the Jacksonville Suns.\nManagerial career.\nPittsburgh Pirates' organization.\nIn 1966, Morgan became a manager in the farm system of the Pittsburgh Pirates, rising in 1970 to Triple-A with the Columbus Jets of the International League. In 1971, he moved with the Jets to Charleston, West Virginia, and became skipper of the Charleston Charlies.\nMorgan was called to the Major Leagues to serve as a Pittsburgh coach under Bill Virdon in , when the Pirates won the National League East Division title but fell in the 1972 NLCS to the Cincinnati Reds. Morgan then returned to the minors as the Pirates' Triple-A manager. In 1973, his Charlies won 85 games and the division title, but lost in the International League playoffs to the Pawtucket Red Sox in five games. Nevertheless, Morgan was selected Minor League Manager of the Year for 1973 by \"The Sporting News\".\nPawtucket Red Sox.\nMorgan joined the Boston Red Sox organization the following season. He led the PawSox—located 24 miles (38 km) from his Walpole hometown—for nine years (1974–82), the longest-tenured manager in the franchise's history. Morgan won 601 games, losing 658 (.477) and was the Pawtucket skipper during its famous 33-inning game against Rochester in , though he was ejected in the 22nd. He won the International League Manager of the Year Award in 1977.\nBoston Red Sox.\nThe parent Red Sox reassigned Morgan after the 1982 season, making him a scout for 1983–84 before he was finally invited to return to the Majors as Boston's first-base coach in . He worked as the team's bullpen coach during the Red Sox' pennant-winning season, then replaced Rene Lachemann as Boston's third-base coach in .\nIn , a Boston team was at one game over .500 under manager John McNamara, leading the ownership to fire him during the All-Star break. They named Morgan acting manager July 14 and began negotiations with high-profile candidates, such as Joe Torre and Lou Piniella, who were under contract to other organizations. The Red Sox won their first 12 games under Morgan – a period dubbed by the press as \"Morgan Magic\" – and the team named him as their permanent field boss. The 1988 Red Sox won the AL East, but were swept by the Oakland Athletics in the American League Championship Series; two years later, the 1990 Sox repeated history, winning their division but bowing in four straight to the A's in the playoffs. Collectively, the Red Sox were 0–8 in the post season under Morgan, an American League record.\nIn , Morgan guided a Boston team to a second-place finish in the AL East. The team had difficulties in June and July before maneuvering their way back in early September; as late as the 21st, they were just a half game behind Toronto in the East. However, they lost 11 of their last 14 games and finished seven games behind Toronto. Although he had one year remaining on his contract, he was fired at season's end in favor of Butch Hobson. Under Hobson, the 1992 Red Sox finished last in the AL East.\nMorgan's final big league managerial totals: 301–262 (.535) over years, all with the Red Sox. His record as a minor league manager over 16 seasons (1966–71; 1973–82) was 1,140 victories and 1,102 defeats (.508) with one league championship (with the York Pirates of the Double-A Eastern League in 1969).\nPopularity.\nMorgan was called \"Walpole Joe,\" as well as \"Turnpike Joe\" in tribute to the offseason job he held for many years to supplement his minor league pay: driving a snowplow on the Massachusetts Turnpike. The nicknames also served to prevent any confusion with Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan. His phrases became part of New England folklore, such as \"I'm the skipper of this nine!\", and \"Roger spun another beauty\", describing one of the outings by his star pitcher, Roger Clemens.\nIn 2006, he was named to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame and the Walpole High School Hockey Hall of Fame. Morgan was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame in 2008. On July 30, 2013, the Red Sox honored him with \"Joe Morgan Night\" at Fenway Park, with Clemens among the former players participating in the festivities.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "title": "Barbados national cricket team",
        "text": "The Barbados national cricket team is the national cricket team of Barbados, organised by the Barbados Cricket Association (BCA). Barbados is a member of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), which is a member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in its own right, and Barbadians play internationally for the West Indies cricket team.\nBarbados does not take part in any international competitions (the 1998 Commonwealth Games tournament being an exception), but rather in inter-regional competitions in the Caribbean, such as the Professional Cricket League (which includes the Regional Four Day Competition and the Regional Super50). The team competes in the Professional Cricket League under the franchise name Barbados Pride.\nThe most prominent Barbadian cricketers include Conrad Hunte, Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith, David Holford, Joel Garner, Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Jason Holder, Malcolm Marshall, Garry Sobers, Seymour Nurse, Kemar Roach, Wayne Daniel, Shai Hope, Clyde Walcott, Everton Weekes and Frank Worrell.\nHistory.\nColonial era.\nCricket in Barbados dates from at least the late 18th century, with the Barbados cricket buckle depicting a slave playing cricket around 1780. In February 1865, Barbados took part in what was later designated the inaugural first-class match in the West Indies, hosting Demerara (now Guyana) at the Garrison Savannah in Bridgetown. Barbados won the match by 138 runs, but lost the return fixture, played in Georgetown later in the year, by two wickets. In September 1891, the Inter-Colonial Tournament was inaugurated, which saw Barbados, British Guiana, and Trinidad engaged in regular competition for the first time. The tournament was played every two seasons until the 1907–08 season, and annually until the 1938–39 season (with a gap during World War I). Barbados won the tournament 11 out of the 28 times it was played, and only failed to make the final on five occasions.\nIn January 1888, Barbados played their first match against a team that was not another British colony in the West Indies, appearing in a fixture against an amateur team representing the United States. That match was not classed as first-class, but the 1890s saw several tours from English sides that were granted first-class status. In 1896, Barbados also played against Jamaica for the first time, winning by an innings and eight runs. A representative West Indies team was organised for the first time in 1897, to play a touring English team led by Arthur Priestley. The inaugural team included three Barbadians – Harold Austin, Donald McAuley, and Clifford Goodman. Austin, a future speaker of the Barbados House of Assembly, later became the first Barbadian to captain the West Indies, doing so in January 1902 against another English team, led by Richard Bennet.\nThe West Indies played their first Test matches on a 1928 tour of England, with five members of the 17-man touring party being Barbadians. The most experienced Barbadian on tour was the 40-year-old George Challenor, who has been called the \"first of the great West Indian batsmen\". The first Barbadian to captain the West Indies in a Test match was Teddy Hoad, who did so when England toured during the 1929–30 season. That match was played at Bridgetown's Kensington Oval, and was the first Test to be held in the West Indies. When the West Indies toured Australia for the first time during the 1930–31 season, another Barbadian, Herman Griffith, became the first bowler to dismiss Don Bradman for a Test match duck.\nIn February 1946, two Barbadian batsmen, Clyde Walcott and Frank Worrell, set a new record for the highest partnership in first-class cricket, putting on 574 not out against Trinidad. Walcott, Worrell, and another Barbadian, Everton Weekes, all made their Test debuts during England's 1947–48 tour of the West Indies. The trio eventually became known as the \"three Ws\", and as \"one of the greatest middle-order line-ups the game has ever seen\", were key members of the West Indies from the late 1940s through to the late 1950s. All three eventually received knighthoods, and were inaugural inductees into the ICC Hall of Fame in 2009. Worrell was especially esteemed as the first black man to captain the West Indies, doing so on the team's 1960–61 tour of Australia. He was succeeded as captain by another Barbadian, Garfield Sobers, whose 365 not out against Pakistan in 1958 set a record for the highest Test score that was not passed for another 36 years.\nPost-independence.\nBarbados gained full independence on 30 November 1966, having earlier been a part of the short-lived West Indies Federation (between 1958 and 1962). The inaugural season of the Shell Shield had been played earlier in the year (and won by Barbados), marking the return of a formal first-class structure for the first time since 1939, when the last Inter-Colonial Tournament was played. In 1973, Barbados also won the inaugural edition of what is now the Regional Super50, the West Indian limited-overs competition. Barbados were the dominant team throughout the early years of the Shell Shield, winning 12 out of the first 20 editions (including five consecutively from the 1975–76 season to the 1979–80 season). In the one-day format, Barbados won the first three editions of the tournament, but did not secure a fourth title until the 1987–88 season, and a fifth title until the 2002–03 season.\nThe West Indian teams that won the 1975 and 1979 World Cups included three and four Barbadians, respectively. Joel Garner, who took a five-wicket haul against England in the 1979 final, was a Barbadian, as was Malcolm Marshall, who was in the squad but did not play any matches. Marshall, who had only made his Test debut the previous year, was one of the world's leading fast bowlers during the 1980s, and established a new record for the most Test wickets taken by a West Indian (since beaten by Courtney Walsh). The West Indian opening batsmen throughout the 1980s were Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes, both Barbadians. Greenidge and Haynes opened the batting together in 148 innings between 1978 and 1991, and put on 6,482 runs together, both records for opening batsmen that have yet to be beaten.\nAt the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Barbados and the other West Indian teams participated individually in the cricket tournament, held for the first and only time. Barbados easily defeated Northern Ireland and Bangladesh, but lost to South Africa in their final group-stage match to miss out on qualification for the semi-finals. The team's participation in the Commonwealth Games coincided with a period of superiority at domestic first-class level – from the 1994–95 season through to the 2003–04 season, the team won six out of ten titles. Internationally, Floyd Reifer captained the West Indies in a 2009 Test series against Bangladesh, the first Barbadian to do so since Desmond Haynes in 1990. However, his appointment was only temporary, coming during a players' strike. Jason Holder, who was appointed Test captain in 2015, is the most recent Barbadian to serve as captain of the West Indies.\nCurrent squad.\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\nSource: Regional Four Day Competition, Regional Super50\nVenues.\nThe primary venue for Barbados is Bridgetown's Kensington Oval, which has a capacity of 28,000 people. Kensington Oval is the only ground in the country to have hosted international cricket (Tests, One Day Internationals, or Twenty20 Internationals), and was the venue for the final of the 2007 World Cup. An additional nine grounds have hosted Barbados home matches (with either first-class or List A status), listed below in order of first use:\nOne other ground in Barbados has hosted first-class cricket without hosting any home games for Barbados – Foursquare Park, in Highland."

        "title": "Poland men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Poland men's national basketball team () represents Poland in international basketball competitions. They are controlled by the Polish Basketball Federation (PZKosz).\nPoland has competed at the EuroBasket on 28 occasions, with their best performance at the tournament coming in 1963, as hosts, finishing as runners-up. Poland has competed six times at the Olympic Games, with their best finish being fourth place at the first edition of the event in 1936. Poland have also made two appearances at the FIBA World Cup, with their first coming in 1967, and their second occurring 52 years later in 2019.\nHistory.\n1936 Olympic Games.\nThe 1936 Summer Olympics was the first tournament Poland took part in. They eventually placed an impressive fourth at the event, in the then 23 team tournament.\nEuroBasket 1937.\nThe EuroBasket 1937 in Riga, marked the first ever appearance for the national team at the European Basketball Championship. In the preliminary round the Poles dropped their first match to France, but rebounded with victories against Latvia and Czechoslovakia. They finished with an 2–1 record, and moved on to the semi-finals where they played Lithuania. There they were defeated by the eventual champion Lithuanian squad 31–25, relegating them to the bronze medal match. For the bronze, the team was defeated again by France to end their maiden run at the Eurobasket.\nEuroBasket 1939.\nTwo years later at EuroBasket 1939 in Kaunas, the competition format was a single round-robin without playoffs. Latvia and Lithuania both defeated Poland whereas the other five teams in the competition fell to the Poles. With Lithuania undefeated and Poland and Latvia tied with a record of 5–2, the loss to Latvia was decisive in pushing Poland to third place and the bronze.\nEuroBasket 1946.\nDue to World War II, the next European basketball championship was at EuroBasket 1946 in Geneva. The Poles started well, with a victory over Luxembourg. They then lost their next two preliminary round matches to Italy, and Hungary to finish in third place of the four-team group. That result put them in the 7th–10th place classification semi-final, where they lost again, this time to Belgium. In the 9th/10th place playoff, Poland defeated England.\nEuroBasket 1947.\nThe EuroBasket returned to the odd-year schedule with EuroBasket 1947 in Prague. Poland placed second in their preliminary group, losing only to eventual silver medallist Czechoslovakia en route to a 2–1 record. They then went 1–2 in their semi-final group, falling to the gold medal Soviet Union team and bronze medal Egypt. This put Poland in a 5th/6th place playoff against France, who had been 1–2 in the opposite semi-final group. France went on to win, 62–29.\nEuroBasket 1955.\nAfter an 8-year hiatus, Poland returned at EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest. They quickly showed that they could still play with the European field, winning all four of their preliminary round games to advance to the final round. Despite their mediocre 3–4 record in that round, the Poles had demonstrated that they could be effective against the best of the European pool with a 72–68 win over eventual runners-up Czechoslovakia. They eventually finished 5th overall of the 18 teams in the tournament.\nEuroBasket 1957.\nTwo years later in Sofia, Poland competed at EuroBasket 1957. Despite being seeded into the same preliminary pool as the Soviet Union, the Poles went 2–1 in the round-robin and advanced to the final round. There they lost their first six of seven games in that round, getting their first win in the last game of the round, against France to finish the tournament in 7th place.\nEuroBasket 1963.\nFive years later the national team hosted EuroBasket 1963 in Wroclaw. They got off to a fast start winning their first match against Spain 79–76. They fell to the Soviet Union in their next match. But, eventually ran the table the rest of the way in their preliminary round group to finish with an 6–1 record to advance. In the semi-finals the Poles defeated Yugoslavia, to get within a win of the gold medal. There they met up against the Soviet Union again, and were dominated 61–45 to instead take silver.\n1964 Olympic Games.\nAs vice champion of the EuroBasket, at the 1964 Summer Olympics, the Poles came off an impressive start as they finished 3rd out of 8 in the preliminary round. Overall, they finished 6th out of 16, ahead of SFR Yugoslavia, Uruguay and Mexico, which were all major players at the global stage at that time.\n1967 World Cup.\nThe 1967 World Cup was the first appearance for the national team to compete at the global tournament. The team finished 2–1 in their preliminary group, with victories against Paraguay and Puerto Rico to advance to the final round. There they finished their first ever trip to the World Cup with an subpar 2–4 record, placing 5th in the event.\n1968 Olympic Games.\nJust like at the last Summer Olympics in Tokyo, the Poles finished the preliminary round at the 1968 event in Mexico City with a winning record. Overall, they finished 6th out of 16. Just like at the EuroBasket 1967, Poland won against Bulgaria for its closest victory of the tournament.\nSeventh Heaven (1987-1997).\nFrom 1987 to 1997, the national team only managed to qualify for the European Basketball Championship three times out of a possible six. They finished in seventh place in each tournament in 1987, 1991, and 1997. Although after 1997 Poland would fail to qualify for the top European basketball event for the next decade.\nThe 10-year span.\nAfter years of failed qualifications, Poland finally made their way back to the EuroBasket at the 2007 tournament. It was quite an unexpected achievement for the Poles. But, overall they did not make much noise. Because of injury, many key players including Michał Ignerski and Maciej Lampe did not compete at the event. The Poles lost all 3 games, but even in defeat they remained competitive losing by only 8 to a well-regarded French team and by 9 to the Italian squad.\nEuroBasket 2009.\nThe White and Red hosted the EuroBasket 2009, making it the first time the national team qualified for consecutive EuroBasket tournaments since the mid 1980s. They got off to an impressive start putting away Bulgaria in the first game 90–78. The team followed that up with another strong performance versus Lithuania 86–75, before dropping their final game in preliminary play against Turkey. With an 2–1 record the team was able to advance to the second round. There, the team came up short in group play with an 1–4 record and a 9th place finish overall at the event.\nLater years (2009-2019).\nAfter 2009, the national team qualified for every EuroBasket in the 2010s. But they could only manage to finish in the top half of the tournament once, that being in 2015.\n2019 World Cup.\nIn 2019, the national team qualified for the World Cup. It was their first qualification to a global event since 1980 Olympics in Moscow. During the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Poland was put into a group with group favourite China, Ivory Coast, and Venezuela. After a convincing win over Venezuela, Poland upset the hosts 79-76 in front of a max-capacity crowd in Beijing. Poland was down 72-69 with 15 seconds left before Chinese NBA center Zhou Qi made 2 straight turnovers allowing Poland to send the game into overtime. Aaron Cel made a driving layup to put Poland up 78-76 and the upset was sealed when Yi Jianlian missed the game-tying shot. Poland finished 3-0 in their group and moved onto the next round, where they defeated Russia 79-74 before losing to Argentina. In the quarterfinals they faced eventual champions Spain and narrowly lost 90-78, eventually finishing the tournament in 8th place.\nEuroBasket 2022.\nAt the EuroBasket 2022 qualification, Jeremy Sochan became the youngest player to ever play for Poland's national team. In his very first game, he led Poland over Romania 88-81. He played 29 minutes in which he scored 18 points, including a four-point play (3 pointer plus foul and free throw) at the end and a game-deciding block.\nThe Orly played in Group D held in Prague. Poland started off with a win over co-host Czech Republic by 99-84. But in their second match, they fell back to Finland by 89-59. They later went back strong with their second win over Israel by 85-76. They won in their fourth match against the Netherlands 75-69. But in the fifth and final preliminary match, lost to Serbia by 96-69. In the knockout stage, they started their Final Phase campaign in the Round of 16 with a win over Ukraine by 93-86. In the quarter-finals, they stunned Slovenia by winning 90-87. But in the semi-finals they were unable to catch up and lost to France by 54-95. In the third place match, Poland fell behind to co-host Germany and lost by 69-82. Poland finished fourth in the final standings, it became Poland's strong finish for the first time since 1967.\nEuroBasket 2025.\nPoland will co-host the EuroBasket 2025 after being able to step in for Ukraine. Poland is currently playing in the qualifiers despite already earning an automatic qualification as co-host. Matches will be held at the Spodek in Katowice.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 22 and 26 February 2024 against Lithuania and North Macedonia.\nPast

        "text": "The Estonia men's national basketball team () represents Estonia in international basketball matches. They are controlled by the Estonian Basketball Association. The team competed in their first international tournament at the 1936 Olympic Games. Estonia has also qualified for the EuroBasket six times overall, with their best results coming in 1937 and 1939. However, after 1939, Estonia halted national team activities due to the occupation of the Baltic states during World War II. Estonia would later rejoin FIBA in 1991, after regaining independence from the Soviet Union.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1920s–1930s).\nEstonia played their first ever international match against their Baltic neighbors Latvia, on 29 April 1924, a 20–16 defeat in Riga. Ten years later, on 30 November 1934, Estonia would become a member of FIBA. Two years after that, the national team played in their first international tournament at the 1936 Olympic Games, held in Berlin. It was the first Olympic tournament to hold basketball as an official medal event. Led by head coach Herbert Niiler, Estonia played their opening match of the tournament against France, where the team came away with a 34–29 win. The national team lost their subsequent second round game to the United States 28–52, but passed the consolation round and faced the Philippines in the third round, losing 22–39.\nEstonia participated at the European Basketball Championship for the first time in 1937. The team won its first game against Egypt 44–15, but failed to advance past the group stage after suffering a 15–20 defeat against Lithuania, and a 20–30 defeat against Italy. Estonia would finish out the rest of the tournament to place fifth in the final rankings, after defeating Czechoslovakia 30–20 and Latvia 41–19.\nTwo years later at the EuroBasket 1939, the tournament used a different format from the previous championship, with eight teams facing off in a round-robin competition. Estonia would finish the tournament with a (4–3) record and once again finished in fifth place at the event. Heino Veskila was the tournament's scoring leader averaging 16.7 points per game.\nIn 1940, Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union and the team was disbanded.\nNational team restored (1990s).\nAfter the restoration of independence, the Estonian Basketball Association rejoined FIBA in 1991. Estonia qualified for EuroBasket 1993, held in Germany. Despite missing star players Martin Müürsepp and Tiit Sokk, the team, coached by Jaak Salumets won their group in the preliminary round, finishing ahead of Slovenia, Belgium, and hosts and eventual champions Germany. In the second round, Estonia finished third in their group and advanced to the quarter-finals, where the team lost to Russia 61–82 to be eliminated. In the classification rounds, Estonia defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 99–91 and lost to Spain 80–119, finishing the championship in sixth place with a (6–5) record. Aivar Kuusmaa was the team's scoring leader with 19.9 points per game.\n2000s–2010s.\nEstonia once again qualified for the EuroBasket, after failing to qualify for the tournament on three occasions after 1993. The team went (7–3) during the qualification period to reach EuroBasket 2001, held in Turkey. Coached by Üllar Kerde, Estonia lost all three of their preliminary round matches against Germany, FR Yugoslavia and Croatia, failing to advance past the group stage and finishing the championship with a disappointing (0–3) record and a 14th place finish. Martin Müürsepp led the team in scoring with 18.3 points per game, while Margus Metstak collected 6.0 rebounds per game, and Rauno Pehka and Tanel Tein averaged 2.7 assists per game. After 2001, Estonia failed to qualify for another major international basketball tournament for 14 years. Although the team competed at the second tier Division B competition in 2011, winning their group.\nCoached by Tiit Sokk, Estonia qualified for EuroBasket 2015, with preliminary round matches held in Riga, Latvia. Estonia's first two performances were poor as the team suffered heavy defeats in matches against Czech Republic 57–80 and Belgium 55–84. However, the team bounced back with a 78–71 victory over Ukraine, their first EuroBasket victory since 1993. The next game saw Estonia defeated in a close game by Lithuania 62–64. In their final group phase match, Estonia were up against Latvia, which resulted in a 64–75 loss and failing to advance to the knockout stage. Estonia finished the championship in 20th place with a (1–4) record. Gregor Arbet was the team's scoring leader at 11.6 points per game, while Siim-Sander Vene averaged 6.4 rebounds and Sten Sokk contributed 4.2 assists per game.\nIn qualification for EuroBasket 2017, Estonia won their first two games against, Belarus, and Portugal to put the team at a record of (2–0). However, Estonia would drop three of their final four matches to eliminate the team from qualifying.\nAfter missing their opportunity to reach EuroBasket 2017, Estonia turned their focus toward qualifying for the 2019 FIBA World Cup. The team first went through European Pre-Qualifiers, where they accumulated a (3–1) record during the process, to advance. Entering the first round of European Qualifiers, Estonia would split their first four matches for a record of (2–2), before losing their final two games to Great Britain and Greece respectively. Although by defeating Great Britain in their first match of the qualifiers between the two, it proved enough for Estonia to move on to the second and final phase of European qualifiers. There, the team lost their first four games of the round, before managing to salvage their final two matches before being eliminated. In October 2019, the Estonian Basketball Association named Jukka Toijala as the new head coach of the national team.\n2020s.\nEstonia competed in the EuroBasket 2022 with group phase games played in Milan, Italy. The team started the tournament with a 62–83 loss to the hosts, followed by two narrow defeats against Ukraine (73–74) and Croatia (70–73). Estonia then won 94–62 against Great Britain before losing to Greece 69–90. The team failed to advance to the round of 16 and finished the tournament in 19th place. Maik-Kalev Kotsar averaged the team-best 12.2 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, while Kerr Kriisa led the team with 5.8 assists per game.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 23 and 26 February 2024 against North Macedonia and Lithuania.\nRecent call-ups.\nCurrent notable players who have played for the national team:\nPast rosters.\n1936 Olympic Games: finished 9th among 23 teams\n3 Erich Altosaar, 4 Artur Amon, 5 Aleksander Illi, 6 Vladimir Kärk, 8 Robert Keres, 9 Evald Mahl, 10 Aleksander Margiste, 11 Bernhard Nooni, 12 Leonid Saar, 13 Heino Veskila, 14 Georg Vinogradov (Coach: Herbert Niiler)\n1937 EuroBasket: finished 5th among 8 teams\n3 Oskar Erikson, 4 Aleksander Illi, 5 Vladimir Kärk, 6 Robert Keres, 7 Evald Mahl, 8 Albert Suurna, 9 Heino Veskila, 10 Ralf Viksten, 11 Alfred Zimmermann (Coach: Herbert Niiler)\n1939 EuroBasket: finished 5th among 8 teams\n3 Valdeko Valdmäe, 4 Oskar Erikson, 5 Herbert Tillemann, 6 Ralf Viksten, 7 Georg Vinogradov, 8 Artur Amon, 9 Hans Juurup, 10 Erich Altosaar, 11 Heino Veskila, 13 Evald Mahl (Coach: Herbert Niiler)\n1993 EuroBasket: finished 6th among 16 teams\n4 Toomas Kandimaa, 5 Aivar Kuusmaa, 6 Erki Kivinukk, 7 Ivo Saksakulm, 8 Margus Metstak, 9 Andrus Nagel, 10 Indrek Rumma, 11 Sergei Babenko, 12 Marek Noormets, 13 Aleksandr Karavajev, 14 Gert Kullamäe, 15 Rauno Pehka (Coach: Jaak Salumets)\n2001 EuroBasket: finished 14th among 16 teams\n4 Tanel Tein, 5 Indrek Varblane, 6 Toomas Kandimaa, 7 Valmo Kriisa, 8 Margus Metstak, 9 Andre Pärn, 10 Indrek Rumma, 11 Tarmo Kikerpill, 12 Marek Noormets, 13 Martin Müürsepp, 14 Toomas Liivak, 15 Rauno Pehka (Coach: Üllar Kerde)\n2015 EuroBasket: finished 20th among 24 teams\n4 Rain Veideman, 5 Tanel Sokk, 6 Gert Dorbek, 7 Sten Sokk, 8 Janar Talts, 9 Gregor Arbet, 10 Erik Keedus, 11 Siim-Sander Vene, 13 Joosep Toome, 14 Kristjan Kangur, 15 Reinar Hallik, 20 Tanel Kurbas (Coach: Tiit Sokk)\n2022 EuroBasket: finished 19th among 24 teams\n0 Henri Drell, 2 Sander Raieste, 7 Sten Sokk, 9 Matthias Tass, 11 Siim-Sander Vene, 15 Maik-Kalev Kotsar, 20 Rauno Nurger, 21 Janari Jõesaar, 22 Martin Dorbek, 33 Kristjan Kitsing, 44 Kerr Kriisa, 77 Kristian Kullamäe (Coach: Jukka Toijala)"

        "text": "The Egypt national basketball team represents Egypt in international basketball competitions. The team is directed by the Egyptian Basketball Federation.\nWinning the title of the EuroBasket 1949 has been the team's most celebrated achievement. They are the only non-European nation to win the competition. In addition its 5th-place finish at the 1950 FIBA World Championship as well as its 9th-place finish at the 1952 Summer Olympics, remain the best results ever of an African nation at each tournament. The title of the EuroBasket 1949, is the most prestigious basketball title of an African nation as well. At the FIBA Africa Championship, Egypt holds a record number of 17 medals (alongside Angola). Egypt joined the International Federation of Basketball (FIBA) in 1934 and has Africa's longest basketball tradition.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 1937.\nThe Egyptians finished last at the second European basketball championship, the EuroBasket 1937 held by FIBA Europe continental federation. They had lost their first two preliminary round games against Estonia and Lithuania before withdrawing from the tournament. Their remaining matches were lost by default, including the final preliminary match, the classification semi-final, and the 7th/8th playoff.\nEuroBasket 1947.\nEgypt was much more successful in their next appearance, the EuroBasket 1947. They won all three of their preliminary group matches and their first semi-final group game. Their only loss of the tournament came to eventual gold medallist Soviet Union in the second semi-final group game, before Egypt won their third. Their 2–1 record in the semi-final group placed them second and set up a bronze medal match against Belgium, whom Egypt had defeated in the preliminary round. Egypt won again in a close 50–48 match, winning their first European medal.\nEuroBasket 1949.\nThe following championship was both hosted and won by Egypt. In a relatively small event with seven teams, none of which had placed better than third previously (France and Egypt had both done so), the Egyptians had little trouble winning their first five games. By the luck of the draw, Egypt did not face France until the last game of the tournament, so while the standings were based entirely on the seven-team round robin, the two undefeated teams found themselves facing each other in the last game of the tournament. Dominating 36–16 after the first half, the Egyptians added another point to their lead in the second half to win the game 57–36. The star player and captain was Albert Tadros. Overall, some of the prominent players include winners of the event were Tadros &amp; Hussain Montasser. Later, Tadros was honored as the best player and Montasser was the top-scorer.\nEuroBasket 1953.\nIn Moscow, the Egyptian team once again competed. The EuroBasket 1953 saw the Egypt squad win their preliminary group easily, scoring more points in the round than anyone save the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, the latter of which had had one more game than Egypt. The final round was less conducive to Egyptian success, however; they defeated only Italy on their way to a 1–6 record. Their six losses included a forfeit to Israel, whom Egypt refused to play. The squad took 8th place of the 8 teams in the final round and 17 overall.\nLater years.\nIn much later years Mohammed Sayed-Soliman Known as Salaawa was the 1984 Olympic Games top-scorer.\nIn the aftermath of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, several of Egypt's elite players did not compete at the 2011 FIBA Africa Championship. Most notably, Omar Orabi, the Egyptian American Omar Samhan, and Ahmad Ismail all star forward in the Lebanese Basketball League.\nPerformance table.\nOlympic Games.\nEgypt withdrew from the 1972 tournament following the events of the Munich massacre. At the 1976 Olympics, Egypt withdrew after one game following the boycott of several African countries against New Zealand.\nFIBA Africa Championship.\nEgypt has won a record 17 medals at the AfroBasket (formerly the African Championship) and is tied for second for most titles (5), trailing Angola. Egypt hosted the tournament a record six times, winning a medal in each of those tournaments including four gold medals.&lt;br&gt;\n Champions  \n Runners-up  \n Third place  \n Fourth place  \nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nTeam for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nNotable players.\nOther current notable players from Egypt:\nPast rosters.\n1947 EuroBasket: finished 3rd among 14 teams\nAlbert Tadros, Gabriel \"Gaby\" Catafago, Youssef Abbas, Fouad Abdelmeguid el-Kheir, Abdelrahman Ismail, Hussein Montasser, Wahid Saleh, Zaki Harari, Hassan Moawad, Zaki Yehia, Guido Acher, Maurice Calife\nEuroBasket 1949: finished 1st among 7 teams\nGabriel \"Gaby\" Catafago, Albert Tadros, Youssef Abouaouf, Fouad Abdelmeguid el-Kheir, Abdelrahman Ismail, Hussein Montasser, Nessim Salah el-Dine, Wahid Saleh, Medhat Youssef, Mohammed Soliman, Youssef Abbas, Mohammed Ali el-Rashidi (Coach: Carmine \"Nello\" Paratore), Team captain: Albert Tadros\nTeam for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nTeam for the 2015 FIBA Africa Championship."

        "text": "Michael John Smith (born May 19, 1965) is an American former basketball player and television commentator. During his college years, he played for Brigham Young University, where he was a consensus second team All-American. As a professional player, he spent two seasons in the NBA with the Boston Celtics and part of one season with the Los Angeles Clippers. He also spent several years playing in Liga ACB and Lega Basket. After retiring from professional basketball, he worked for several years as the television color analyst for the Los Angeles Clippers.\nCollege career.\nAfter attending Los Altos High School in Hacienda Heights, California, Smith was a standout basketball player at Brigham Young University. He excelled in both football and volleyball before concentrating on basketball exclusively. Smith served two years (1984–86) as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Argentina before returning to BYU to finish his collegiate basketball career. He won the WAC Player of the Year in 1988 leading the team with 679 points and 248 rebounds. He finished his collegiate career as BYU's all-time leader in rebounds (922) and second to Danny Ainge in career points (2319).\nProfessional career.\nBoston Celtics (1989–1991).\nSmith was selected 13th overall in the first round of the 1989 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. He was one of the oldest players in the draft at 24 years old. At the time the Celtics were a playoff contending team. They were championship contenders a few years prior to the 1989 offseason, however the team was declining due to the age growth and injury of star player Larry Bird and the roster had been rapidly changing. The team still made the playoffs in both of the seasons that Smith played for them. In the 1990 playoffs the Celtics faced the New York Knicks. While the Celtics put up a tough fight, they eventually fell in the series-deciding game 5 and lost 3-2.\nOn February 4, 1990, Smith had a career high 8 assists in a 121-89 win to the Sacramento Kings.\nOn February 24, 1990, Smith dropped a career high 24 points in a 115-107 win over the Denver Nuggets.\nOn March 2, 1990, Smith had a career high 10 rebounds in a 122-110 win over the Miami Heat.\nIn the following season the Celtics returned to the playoffs and played the Indiana Pacers.

Smith never made the NBA Playoffs in his career ever again.\nOn October 30, 1991, Smith was waived by the Celtics.\nBrescia (1991–1992).\nSmith moved to Italy following his departure from the Celtics. He played the following season with Brescia in Lega Basket.\nMilwaukee Bucks (1992).\nSmith returned to the USA and returned to the NBA briefly.

        "title": "Kenny Williams (baseball)",
        "text": "Kenneth Royal Williams (born April 6, 1964) is an American former outfielder in Major League Baseball and a former Executive Vice President of the Chicago White Sox.\nPlaying career.\nSelected by the White Sox in the third round of the amateur draft, Williams made his debut in and spent three years in Chicago, primarily as a center fielder, before being traded to the Detroit Tigers in . The Tigers waived him during the season, and he was claimed by the Toronto Blue Jays. Williams remained a bit player with the Blue Jays, usually coming on as a pinch-runner due to his speed. He was the starting center fielder when Dave Stieb threw his only no-hitter, the first no-hitter in Toronto history. He is best remembered as a player for a bizarre incident during the 1990 season, where a series of wild throwing errors resulted in him (on base as a pinch-runner) rounding third base and mauling over third base coach John McLaren, knocking him out in the process (Williams himself was winded, but eventually ended up scoring the run). This humorous clip would be played over and over in blooper reels for years to come. The Blue Jays then put him on waivers during the season, with Canada's other major league team, the Montreal Expos, picking him up. Williams decided to retire from baseball after being released by Montreal following the 1991 season.\nAdministrative career.\nIn November , Williams rejoined the White Sox organization as a scout. Named special assistant to Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf in , he spent some time as a studio analyst for Sox games on SportsChannel Chicago before becoming the team's director of minor league operations in . In , he was named vice-president of player development, a position in which he remained until .\nGeneral manager.\nIn October 2000, Williams replaced Ron Schueler as the general manager of the White Sox. Williams inherited Jerry Manuel as his first manager, who had just led them to 95 wins and a division title prior to Williams being promoted to GM. At the conclusion of the 2003 season Manuel was fired despite a winning record of 86–76. Williams then hired popular former Chicago shortstop Ozzie Guillén as the team's manager in . Since becoming the White Sox GM, Williams has become known for his aggressive moves to bolster the Sox lineup. This reputation was strengthened following the season, when Williams completely made over the White Sox team by switching its on-field focus from home runs to pitching, defense, and speed. Accordingly, he acquired players which excelled in those areas, through free agent signings (Orlando Hernández, Dustin Hermanson, Jermaine Dye, A. J. Pierzynski, Tadahito Iguchi), trades (Scott Podsednik, José Contreras, Freddy García) and the farm system (Joe Crede, Aaron Rowand). Both Crede and Rowand were drafted by Schueler. Williams' off-season maneuvers were reflected in an extremely successful campaign for the South Siders, one in which they held the best record in all of baseball for most of the year, and finished with the best record in the AL to clinch their first AL Central Division title since 2000, their first American League pennant since 1959, and their first World Series since 1917.\nIn the off-season prior to the 2006 season, Williams set out to improve his world championship team further by acquiring pitcher Javier Vázquez from the Arizona Diamondbacks and slugger Jim Thome from the Philadelphia Phillies. In addition, Williams was cognizant of the large role that the bench played under Ozzie Guillén and solidified it by trading for Rob Mackowiak and Alex Cintrón. Because of these maneuvers, the White Sox were once again favored to win the 2006 American League Central. At the All-Star break, the White Sox were tied with the Detroit Tigers for first place and held a 6-game lead over the New York Yankees for the wild card. The lead evaporated in the second half of the season and despite winning 90 games, they fell short and finished in third place in their Division behind the Detroit Tigers and Minnesota Twins, thereby not making the playoffs.\nIn the offseason before the season, Williams traded away Freddy García to the Phillies and acquired prospects, Gavin Floyd and Gio González, in return. He also signed veteran free agent Darin Erstad to a one-year, $1 million contract. Williams has also stated that the team needs to get younger and improve its scouting. In early January 2008, he traded Gio González, Fautino de los Santos, and Ryan Sweeney for Nick Swisher.\nWith pitcher Jake Peavy being acquired at the trade deadline for the 2009 season, Williams was referred to by Gordon Edes of Yahoo Sports as a \"stealth bomber\" for his under the radar moves. On August 10, , Williams made another under-the-radar move, by claiming OF Alex Ríos off the waivers from the Toronto Blue Jays. On September 29, 2011, Ozzie Guillén was traded to the Miami Marlins, along with minor league pitcher Ricardo Andres. The Marlins assumed the last year on Guillen's contract, in exchange for minor league pitchers Jhan Mariñez and Osvaldo Martinez. On October 6, 2011, Kenny Williams hired Robin Ventura as the new manager of the Chicago White Sox.\nOn October 26, 2012, Williams was promoted to executive vice president of the Chicago White Sox while assistant GM Rick Hahn was promoted to general manager.\nOn December 6, 2016, Williams oversaw the trade in which he sent Chris Sale to the Boston Red Sox for Michael Kopech, Yoan Moncada and Luis Alexander Basabe.\nThe White Sox fired Hahn and Williams on August 22, 2023.\nPersonal life.\nKenny resides in Naperville, Illinois. He has 5 children:\nKenny also has one granddaughter. He remarried television journalist Zoraida Sambolin in July 2014. Williams has two new stepchildren, Sambolin's son Nicolas and daughter Sofia."

In 1999, Hanley played his only Test for England. He was Sale's \"Player of the Year\" in 2004. After suffering a back injury in December 2007, Hanley retired in July 2008 after being told by doctors he would not recover well enough to play professional rugby. He scored 104 tries in 191 games, 75 of which were in the Premiership.\nPlaying career.\nStarting out and early international recognition.\nborn 11 June 1979 in Whitehaven, England, Hanley signed with Sale Sharks in 1998. With a Grand Slam on the cards, Hanley was one of two Sale players to make their international debut in England's final match of their 1999 Five Nations campaign along with Barrie-Jon Mather. Although Hanley scored a try, he also was handed-off by Craig Quinnell and suffered a broken arm as Wales won 32–31. It was the only match Hanley would play for the senior England team. It was never explained to him why he was not selected again, although there was speculation that his defence need to be improved. In 2001, he trained with rugby league side St. Helens to improve his defence. Reflecting in 2005 on why he was unable to break into the England team after 1999, Hanley said \"They had a settled side under Clive [Woodward] and once you were in, it was hard to get out as the team was winning all the time\".\nThe First Team which had been bought by a local entrepreneur moved from Heywood Road in Sale to Edgeley Park in Stockport in 2003. A mixed season saw Sale win at Welford Road for the first time, and later become the first club to score six tries in a match at the same venue; progress to the final of the Powergen Cup where they were defeated 37–33 by Newcastle Falcons; and fail to qualify for the Heineken Cup. Hanley was named the club's \"Player of the Season\". Philippe Saint-André joined Sale as their coach in March 2004. Speaking in 2005 of Saint-André's effect on Sale, Hanley noted that \"He has brought a lot of different ideas to the club, people have stood up and taken notice of him. He has a special interest in his wingers and has lots of good ideas and little technical things only a player who has played the class of rugby he has would know.\"\nIn the final Premiership match of the 2004/05 season, Hanley suffered a broken leg. The injury was sustained in a 22–43 defeat to London Wasps in May as Sale finished third in the league. It forced him to miss the European Challenge Cup Final against Pau, although he had played in every match of the club's campaign. Sale won 27–3, their first piece of silverware since 2002. Hanley scored 15 tries in the season, nine of which were in the Premiership. Sale's back three – made up of Hanley, Mark Cueto, and Jason Robinson – scored more tries than any other club's.\nThere was a friendly rivalry between Hanley and fellow Sale winger Mark Cueto to see who would finish each season as the club's leading try-scorer. Hanley recovered from his broken leg and returned to first team rugby on 17 August 2005, scoring a try in Sale's 26–23 win over Castres Olympique in the Heineken Cup. In 2006, Hanley was named Sale's \"Community Player of the Season\". In the 2005–2006 season, Hanley made 8 appearances as Sale Sharks won their first ever Premiership title.\nInjury and retirement.\nDuring a Challenge Cup match against Bayonne in December 2007, Hanley suffered a back injury. Unable to recover, in July 2008 he announced his retirement from rugby. In his ten-year career with Sale, he played 191 matches, scoring 104 tries. According to Hanley, \"the medical advice is that I will not be able to play Premiership rugby again\". He finished his career with 75 Premiership tries, a record at the time surpassed by his great rival at Sale Sharks, Mark Cueto in 2013. The following season, 2008/09, the club held a testimonial for Hanley. He commented that \"For me, it's been so nice to get back in touch with everybody. You play with these guys for so long and when you are in a rugby environment they are some of your best mates. But when they drift away you tend to lose contact with people so it has been brilliant to catch up with so many old friends.\"\nHe has retained connections with Sale since retiring from playing and works in the club's commercial department, whilst also running a successful football social media group called world football banter"

        "text": "Major League Cricket (MLC) was an American company based in Brooklyn dedicated to running a professional cricket competition within the United States, as well as developing and promoting the sport to raise its profile in North America. MLC was not recognized by the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA), and thus had no official status within the recognized international structure of cricket. It is unrelated to the like-named organization that began play in July 2023.\nHistory.\nMLC formed in New Jersey in 2000, with the explicit goals of developing grassroots support for young cricketers in the U.S. and leading up to professional competitiveness at the international level. During its early years, MLC was stifled from achieving much within the organization of cricket by the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA). However, with the increasing disruption to U.S. cricket administration caused by political turmoil within USACA, the overall structure of U.S. cricket began to break down, allowing MLC to step into the fray and begin organizing its own events.\nWith the collapse of the ambitious Pro Cricket league following its maiden, and only, season in 2004, MLC became a major player in the complex political situation in which American cricket found itself. In February 2006, MLC approached the International Cricket Council (ICC) with a formal request to recognize it as the official governing body of cricket in the U.S., in preference to USACA. The request was eventually turned down by the ICC.\nThe domain name for MLC's website—www.mlcus.com—expired in April 2008 and was not renewed.\nIn 2017, the USACA was expelled by the ICC due to governance issues. It was replaced by USA Cricket in 2019.\nEvents.\nUnder-15 Tournament.\nOn June 7, 2005, MLC announced an under-15 tournament in Chicago, to be played that August, as part of its program of youth cricket development. Italian sporting goods manufacturer L-SPORTO sponsored the competition. However, in July the tournament was first moved to New Jersey, and then cancelled, with MLC citing \"logistical problems\" as the reason. The \"USA Cricket Academy\" headed by Ashok Patel, and Major League Cricket, both based in New Jersey also formed an alliance to develop a New jersey under 13 tournament.\nSir Clive Lloyd Cup.\nMLC announced a new National Interstate Cricket Cup tournament, to be held in November 2005 in Broward County, Florida, under the patronage of former West Indies captain and International Cricket Council match referee Sir Clive Lloyd. Due to Hurricane Wilma, it was postponed to the end of November, eventually being played between 30 November and 4 December.\nTeams representing the states of Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Washington played in the inaugural tournament. The tournament included two divisions, one for senior players, and one for players under the age of 25. Former West Indian opening batsman Desmond Haynes will be involved with coaching national U.S. youth and senior teams selected during the tournament.\nUnited States Cricket Development Program.\nIn July 2005, MLC announced an ambitious 10-year program for the development of domestic competition and international level cricket skills within the U.S. The program developed by Bernard Cameron and expanded by former 1st class players Robert Smith and Desmond Haynes, includes plans to establish National Cricket Centres to encourage local development, a National Cricket Academy, and certification of cricket coaches and umpires. MLC has stated the goal of preparing a U.S. team capable of qualifying for the 2011 Cricket World Cup.\nAnother part of the development program was the establishment of world class cricket playing facilities in the U.S. To this end, MLC met with The Walt Disney Company and convinced them to pledge over of land in Florida for the construction of a custom multi-function cricket and soccer stadium.\nProfessional Twenty20 league.\nIn September 2005, MLC announced plans to launch a professional eight team Twenty20 league in the U.S., with a first season to have been played in 2007. Players for the tournament were to have been recruited from the state-based teams represented in the Sir Clive Lloyd Cup."

        "text": "The 1990 Daytona 500 was the first stock car race of the 1990 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season and the 32nd iteration of the event. The race was held on Sunday, February 18, 1990, in Daytona Beach, Florida at Daytona International Speedway, a 2.5 miles (4.0 km) permanent triangular-shaped superspeedway. The race took the scheduled 200 laps to complete. On the final lap of the race, Whitcomb Racing driver Derrike Cope would manage to take advantage of a misfortunate Dale Earnhardt, when Earnhardt suffered a flat tire on the final turn of the race, allowing Cope to take the lead. The victory was Cope's first career NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory and his first victory of the season. To fill out the top three, Precision Products Racing driver Terry Labonte and Melling Racing driver Bill Elliott would finish second and third, respectively.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of three superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the other two being Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is 2.5 miles (4.0 km) long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was set by the 1990 Twin 125 Qualifiers. The top two positions were set by qualifying speeds held for the Twin 125 Qualifiers held on Saturday, February 10, with the top two qualifiers in the session earning the top two positions for the Daytona 500. The rest of the starting was set in the Twin 125 Qualifiers, held on Thursday, February 15 during two races. The top 14 finishers in the first race, excluding the pole position winner, would set the inside row from rows two to 15, and the top 14 finishers in the second race, excluding the outside pole position winner, would set the outside row from rows two to 15. The remaining non-qualifiers would set positions 31-40 based on qualifying speeds from the first qualifying session held on Saturday. If needed, up to two extra provisionals were given to teams high enough in the previous season's owner's standings that did not qualify for the race by either qualifying speed or from the Twin 125 Qualifiers.\nKen Schrader, driving for Hendrick Motorsports, would win the pole, setting a time of 45.798 and an average speed of in Saturday's session.\n19 drivers would fail to qualify.\nRace review.\nOn the Busch Pole for the third year in a row, Ken Schrader quickly passed several cars at the start after beginning the race in his backup car due to a practice crash. By the first caution flag, Schrader had driven up to second place. Geoff Bodine led the first lap of the race and the season. Two cars used to create film footage for the upcoming movie \"Days of Thunder,\" driven by Bobby Hamilton and Tommy Ellis, started the race in the last row, completing 100 miles before parking. Those cars were not listed in the official race results.\nOn Lap 27, Richard Petty (who started a promising 11th) spun ahead of Phil Parsons while running 13th. The spin left him with all four tires flat, meaning The King would need a wrecker to take him to the pits for new tires, and he would finish well down the order in 34th. During the yellow, Davey Allison (running 6th) pitted with the leaders and hit the pit wall. This was unnoticed by the television broadcast for several minutes; no injuries were reported but Mike Joy confirmed left front toe damage.\nOn Lap 43, an accident occurred between the tri-oval and Turn 1 involving Mike Alexander, Alan Kulwicki (who would continue), Phil Parsons, and 1989 NASCAR Busch Series champion and Winston Cup rookie Rob Moroso. Moroso said he touched Phil Parsons' left rear with his own right front after Parsons came down on him, and Parsons explained that he was attempting a pass on A. J. Foyt. After 58 laps, Schrader's run to the front was halted by an engine failure. Shortly after halfway, 1972 winner A. J. Foyt quit after experiencing a bizarre problem: In a mid-race interview with CBS's David Hobbs, Foyt claimed he had become intoxicated by fumes produced by his new racing helmet.\nDale Earnhardt dominated the race. He led 155 of the 200 laps, relinquishing the lead briefly to Bill Elliott, Mark Martin, Derrike Cope, Davey Allison, Geoff Bodine, Terry Labonte, and Bobby Hillin Jr. Daytona 500 rookies Jimmy Spencer and Jack Pennington led yellow flag laps early in the race.\nDale Earnhardt had the race in his grasp with a lead of more than 40 seconds with ten laps to go. On lap 193, Rick Wilson's car was experiencing engine trouble, and was reported to be leaking oil on the track. Geoff Bodine's car spun between turns 1 and 2, possibly due to the oil, which brought out the third and final caution of the day. Most of the leaders - including Earnhardt - ducked into the pits for tires and fuel. Earnhardt took on four fresh tires, as did Terry Labonte, Ricky Rudd and others. Geoff Bodine was able to change his flat-spotted tires and get back in the race, but not before he fell a lap down. Derrike Cope and Bobby Hillin Jr., however, stayed out during the caution, and cycled up to the front of the field. Cope's crew chief Buddy Parrott made the call to not pit and instead stay out on old tires, gambling on track position.\nSeven cars were on the lead lap for the final restart. The top five were Derrike Cope, Bobby Hillin Jr., Dale Earnhardt, Terry Labonte, and Bill Elliott. As the cars were lining up for the restart, Earnhardt complained that Hillin bumped his left-rear fender. The green came back out with five laps to go. Earnhardt, with drafting help from Geoff Bodine, quickly dispatched of both Hillin and Cope simultaneously going into turn three. Earnhardt pulled out to a slight lead, with Cope (on old tires) tucking into second. Labonte passed Hillin for third.\nRick Wilson's sputtering engine finally let go, and a piece of the metal bell housing broke off and tumbled to a stop on the backstretch unnoticed. The white flag came out as the top four cars (Earnhardt, Cope, Labonte, Elliott) had broken away from the main draft. Going down the backstretch, with less than half a lap to go, Earnhardt ran over the bell housing debris and shredded the right rear tire. He held the wheel straight, let off the throttle and his car climbed up the banking of turn three. The pieces of the bell housing flew through the air, and ended up imbedded in Ricky Rudd's radiator. Spanaway, Washington's Derrike Cope dove under Earnhardt to shockingly take the lead in turn three. With only one turn remaining, Cope held off a last second challenge by Labonte and won his first ever Winston Cup victory. His previous best career finish was a 6th place at Charlotte in 1989. Earnhardt would manage to limp around to the finish line, and placed 5th. His crew later took the shredded tire and hung it on the wall of the race shop using the loss as motivation to win the 1990 Winston Cup championship. Meanwhile, Cope would become an overnight sensation appearing on The Late Show a week or so later to talk about his big win. Although it is considered one of the biggest upsets in NASCAR history, the ratings did not quite show it, as it drew a 7.3, the lowest in Daytona 500 history."

A dual-code rugby international, he won ten caps for Wales and three for the British Lions in rugby union, and two for Wales and 15 for Great Britain in rugby league. \nIn rugby union, he played as a full-back, centre and wing for Llanelli and Neath before turning professional and playing rugby league for Leeds, Wentworthville and Dewsbury RLFC, as well as Other Nationalities. Rugby league historian Robert Gate has described Lewis Jones as \"arguably the most devastating attacking back Wales has ever produced.\"\nEarly life.\nBorn on 11 April 1931, in Gorseinon, Swansea, Lewis Jones was educated at Gowerton Grammar School, where he played both rugby and cricket.\nRugby union career.\nJones played club rugby for Neath before undertaking his national service in the Navy in 1949, a month after his 18th birthday. After leaving the navy he joined Llanelli. He won his first cap for Wales against England in 1950. This was a match Jones might easily have missed, as he had been about to depart for Hong Kong on board an aircraft carrier until the orders were countermanded on discovering that he was a rugby player. The same year he played for the British Lions, being flown out as a replacement for an injured player on the tour to New Zealand and Australia, and playing in three test matches. He scored 63 points in seven games in New Zealand and 16 points against Australia in Brisbane.\nRugby league career.\nIn November 1952, Jones signed for Leeds rugby league club for a record £6,000 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £419,300 in 2016). A broken arm prevented him having much impact in his first season but in the 1953–54 season he scored 302 points and he first represented Wales in 1953 against France. Jones toured Australasia in 1954. In 1956–57, he scored a record 496 points. He also set the record for most points in a test series in 1956–57. He played in the 1957 World Cup.\nIn the 1960–61 season, he played a great part in Leeds' first Championship.\nJones played , was the captain, and scored a try, and five conversions in Leeds' 25–10 victory over Warrington in the Championship Final at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on Saturday 20 May 1961, in front of a crowd of 52,177.\nAfter the 1953 game against France, Wales did not play another RFL officially recognised international match until 1968; but during this period, a representative Wales team played in two games against France, both of which are now considered official by the Rugby League Record Keepers Society who provide data to International Rugby League. The second of these games saw Jones given the captaincy, leading the Wales team out at Toulouse on 17 February 1963.\nJones also represented Great Britain while at Leeds between 1952 and 1956 against France (two non-test matches). Lewis Jones represented the \"Rest of the World\" in the 11–20 defeat by Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground on 29 June 1957.\nJones' Testimonial match at Leeds took place in 1963. He was the first Leeds player to score over 1,000 goals for the club, a feat not matched until 2009 by Kevin Sinfield. Jones became one of fewer than ten Welshmen to have scored more than 2,000 points in their rugby league career.\nJones won 15 caps for Great Britain at rugby league, scoring in every game he played. He spent six years as a player-coach and a further two years as coach of the Wentworthville Magpies in Australia. During his eight-year tenure Wentworthville won seven Second Division premierships. A schoolteacher by profession, he later taught mathematics in Leeds.\nAs of 2015, he is ninth in British rugby league's \"most points in a career\" record list behind; Neil Fox, Jim Sullivan, Kevin Sinfield, Gus Risman, John Woods, Mick Nanyn, Cyril Kellett and Kel Coslett.\nAfter playing.\nAt a ceremony at Wheldon Road, the home of Castleford, on 20 August 2009, Jones was named as one of thirteen rugby league footballers to be honoured by the Arriva Yorkshire bus operator by having a fleet of new buses named after them. Members of the public, supported by local rugby league journalists James Deighton (BBC Leeds) and Tim Butcher (editor of \"Rugby League World\"), nominated the best ever rugby league footballers to have played in West Yorkshire for the 'Arriva Yorkshire Rugby League Dream Team'.\nIn 2013, Jones and three other former players were inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nJones died on 4 March 2024, at the age of 92."

SingaporeSailing works with various clubs and affiliates in Singapore and also the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) and World Sailing on the high performance front.\nThe Federation is currently headed by Lincoln Chee and it is headquartered at the National Sailing Centre in East Coast Park.\nHistory.\nIn 1966, the Singapore Yachting Association was founded by Jack Snowden who served as its first president.\nIn 1994, the National Optimist Sailing Scheme (NOSS) was setup to focus on training sailors on the Optimist class. A National Optimist Certification Scheme was introduced in 2000 to recognise young sailors who take up sailing.\nOn 29 April 2000, the Singapore Yachting Association was renamed as Singapore Sailing Federation, also known as SingaporeSailing.\nOrganisation.\nIn September 2010, Federation revealed a strategic blueprint called The Next Leg. It seeks to steer the development of sailing in the next decade via 10 Strategic Thrusts. These thrusts guide the Federation's efforts as it continues to forge ahead. Besides heightening focus on High Performance operations and programmes, in line with the recommendations put forth by the Olympic Pathway Taskforce in 2011, the Federation also set up a High Participation Committee in 2015 to coordinate efforts in sailing participation islandwide.\nEvents.\nSingaporeSailing organises several events and regattas each year to maintain a vibrant sailing landscape and to engage the community. While there are many regattas each year, some are staple regattas that are held every year.\nSingapore Youth Sailing Championship.\nThe Singapore Youth Sailing Championship is the largest youth regatta in the local sailing calendar. It is typically held in March, in conjunction with the week-long school holiday in Singapore. The regatta is held at the National Sailing Centre, which is an accredited World Sailing Approved Training Centre.\nThe Singapore Youth Sailing Championship is also an international regatta where sailors from overseas are allowed to participate in. The regatta typically witnesses around 350 sailors from 11 different countries competing over 3 or 4 days.\nThe title of the regatta  also varies depending on sponsorship as well as the theme of the event.

In 2018, the venue switched to the Musashino Forest Sports Plaza as the Ariake Coliseum was renovated for the tennis events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. The championship includes men's singles and doubles competitions.\nHistory.\nThe All-Japan Championships was first established in 1915 as a men's only tournament. In 1924, a women's event was added to the programme. The tournament has been mainly played in Tokyo throughout its long run but has also been staged in other cities such as Osaka in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1939. Following World War II, the event was also known as the Japan International Championships up to the late 1960s. From 1979 until 2008, the Japan Open was a joint tournament for both men and women. This is no longer the case in the aftermath of the Ariake Coliseum hosting another women's professional tournament, the Pan Pacific Open. On the women's side, the Japan Open was held until 2014 on the WTA Tour, and then it was downgraded to a $100,000+H ITF Women's Circuit event. In 2019, the women's event was discontinued. The men's event is part of the ATP Tour 500 series level of tournaments.\nPrior to the reorganization of the men's event with the advent of ATP Tour, the Japan Open was known as the Tokyo Outdoor Grand Prix and was part of the Grand Prix tennis tour between 1973 and 1989."

        "text": "Phoenix Cricket Club is a Dublin-based club that currently fields six men's teams, two women's teams, youth teams (for both sexes) in six age bands and an over 40s \"Taverners\" team.\nHistory.\nPhoenix CC is the oldest cricket club in Ireland, founded in 1830, by John Parnell, the father of Charles Stewart Parnell. The younger Parnell, famous for bringing Irish home rule to the forefront of the political agenda, was a member for a short time. It was founded about five years before Dublin University Cricket Club\nThe club has been based in Dublin's Phoenix Park for nearly its entire history, apart from 1835–1838. During those years, Phoenix played their home games in fields near the current site of the Grand Canal, by Upper Baggot Street. During the 1930s, 1940s and 1970s, Phoenix was the dominant club in Leinster cricket.\nEarly years.\nPrior to 1834, the club members met and practised in the Phoenix Park, but in 1835 the club moved out of the Park and played in matches in the open fields south of the canal.\nTwo of the prestigious early members of the club, Lord Dunloe and Lord Clonbrock, were also on the 1833 members list at the MCC. Together with V.E. Alcock, they were mainly responsible for the club expanding and developing over its first 20 years until it reached its zenith as the \"Premier Club of Ireland,\" a contemporaneous description by the newspapers. All the founder-members were later given \"Life Membership\" in recognition of their service to the club.\nIn February 1838, the club relocated to the Phoenix Park again. As the club continued to prosper, the membership increased each year and 20 to 25 matches were played annually. However, in 1846 the road through the Phoenix Park was widened and the club had to move again. A new ground in an adjacent area was recommended, and in view of the expense already incurred by the Club the move was financed by the \"Board of Works,\" at a cost of £73 and Phoenix has been at its present ground since 1847.\nInternational cricket.\nThe first Irish tour to North America was in 1879. Of the thirteen games played against the Philadelphia cricket club, ten were won, two were drawn and one was lost. South Africa made its second visit to Ireland in 1901. At this time, a dispute arose over the method of selecting the Irish team, and as a result, two of the leading Dublin clubs withdrew their names from selection, as did the Northern clubs. The Irish team eventually selected had ten Phoenix men and Bill Harrington of Leinster. (Though Leinster was a party to the dispute, Harrington was also a member of the County Kildare Club, which had kept out of the dispute). Disputes were no uncommon at the time, a few years earlier six Phoenix men had withdrawn from an Irish team because of insufficient Phoenix representation.\nBy 1902, the quarrel over selecting the Irish team was over, and a squad was selected to play a trial match at the Phoenix ground in May 1902. This was selected for a short tour in England. The first match was against W. G. Grace's London County side, and the Irish team won. The third match was at Oxford, with the Irish team losing by 62 runs. The last match was against Cambridge, and Ireland won by 58 runs.\nLeinster Senior League.\nThe Leinster Senior League was formed in 1919 and, while Phoenix had a considerably reduced membership due to the Troubles, the Phoenix team was still up to par. The subconscious policy of being a club for officers and gentlemen still persisted, while the practice of electing a captain on a match-to-match basis continued up until 1932 when W. R. Allen became the first captain appointed for a whole season.\nCentenary celebrations.\nThe Phoenix centenary was celebrated without too much pomp and fuss with a match against R. H. Lambert's selected XI, though the game was rain-affected.\nLater years.\nThe years 1950–1970 were without the glory of the previous years due to an aging team. Despite 2 cups in the 1950s, the next decade was without a major trophy during the whole of that decade.\nIn the latter part of the 1960s one of the most cohesive and formidable teams in the history of Leinster cricket began to emerge. After 22 years, Phoenix won the John Player Senior cup in 1973. In 1974 the team won the inaugural Wiggins Teape League and the following year accomplished the Grand Slam winning all three of Leinster senior trophies. For an entire decade the Phoenix 1st XI fielded no more than fifteen players during which time it won:\n1973: John Player Senior Cup\n1974: Wiggins Teape Competition\n1975: Leinster Senior League / John Player Senior Cup / Wiggins Teape Competition\n1976: John Player Senior Cup\n1977: John Player Senior Cup\n1978: Leinster Senior League / John Player Senior Cup\n1979: Leinster Senior League / John Player Senior Cup\nBy 1980, when Phoenix C.C. celebrated its 150 years jubilee, the club fielded 4 teams in Leinster men's cricket, 2 schoolboys XIs (under 13s and under 15s) and 2 Ladies XIs.\nIn 1975, the inaugural women's team was formed, and became the first women's cricket team in Ireland. Barbara Schmidt became the first female president of an Irish cricket club in 1989.\nIn the early years of the 21st century, Phoenix C.C. has looked to the challenge of fostering the endless fascination and joy of cricket in a new generation of players, to follow in the tradition and the legacy of Ireland's oldest cricket club. Fans are affectionately known as \"The Flamers\". In recent years they've adopted a reworded version of \"Eternal Flame\" by The Bangles as a club anthem.\nCoaching.\nEach year the club runs a coaching programme for people at every ability level. Coaching occurs every weekday with the juniors in the afternoon and the adults in the evening. Other members and coaches from across the various teams also help in the training.\nStadium.\nThe Phoenix ground has a pavilion, a square, full nets facilities, a bar, dressing room areas and car parking."

He was drafted by the Detroit Red Wings in the sixth round, 157th overall, of the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. He played one game in the National Hockey League with Red Wings.\nYoung played junior hockey with the Tri-City Americans and Red Deer Rebels of the Western Hockey League (WHL). While with Red Deer he led the WHL in goal scoring during the 1996–97 season and was named to the WHL East First All-Star Team. Young spent the majority of his career in the minor leagues playing for the Adirondack Red Wings and Cincinnati Mighty Ducks of the American Hockey League, the Manitoba Moose of the International Hockey League, and the Anchorage/Alaska Aces in both the West Coast Hockey League and ECHL. Born in Anchorage, Alaska Young represented the United States at the 1997 World Junior Championships, winning a silver medal.\nCareer.\nAmateur.\nYoung began playing hockey at age four, and by age eight, he was playing travel ice hockey for the Alaska All-Stars. He began his junior career with the Tri-City Americans of the Western Hockey League (WHL). In his first season with the Americans Young scored 19 goals and 43 points in 54 games, adding another goal and two points in two playoff games. During the 1994–95 season, his second, with Tri-City Young was traded to the Red Deer Rebels. Though he only scored 23 points in 51 games between the two teams, Americans' general manager Dennis Beyak stated it was a deal that could come back to haunt them. In his first full season with Red Deer Young had a breakout season scoring 49 goals and 94 points. He followed up by scoring 58 goals and 114 points in 63 games during the 1996–97 season. The goal total led the WHL and he was named to the WHL East First All-Star Team.

        "title": "Steve Thomas (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Stephen Antony \"Stumpy\" Thomas (born July 15, 1963) is a British-born Canadian former ice hockey right winger who played 20 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Chicago Blackhawks, New York Islanders, New Jersey Devils, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Detroit Red Wings.\nPlaying career.\nThomas was born in Stockport, England but was raised in Markham, Ontario, Canada where he attended Markham District High School. As he often coasted in school on his hockey skills, he once had a teacher tell him to \"smarten up, Steve; hockey can only take you so far\". He played junior hockey for the Toronto Marlboros of the OHL (he was the last original Toronto Marlboro to make it to the Maple Leafs of the NHL). Prior to playing in the NHL, Thomas won the Dudley \"Red\" Garrett Memorial Award in 1985 as the top rookie in the American Hockey League, while playing for the St. Catharines Saints.\nThomas went undrafted after his junior career but signed as a free agent with the Toronto Maple Leafs. He began his NHL career in the 1984–85 season. He developed into a bona-fide NHL goal scorer with Toronto, scoring 35 goals in the 1986–87 season. He was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks that summer and played for Chicago until 1991–92 and was then traded to the New York Islanders.\nIt would be with the Islanders that Thomas would have his best years. In the 1992–93 season, Thomas scored 37 goals and 50 assists for a career-high of 87 points. During the playoffs, when Islanders superstar Pierre Turgeon was injured by a Dale Hunter check in the first round, Thomas and teammate Ray Ferraro emerged as the unlikely heroes of the Islander's playoff run. Both made the top ten in postseason scoring as the Islanders made their Cinderella run to the Prince of Wales Conference finals. The next year, he set a career-high in goals with 42.\nThomas had second stints with the Leafs (1998–2001) and Chicago (2001–2002) before moving to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. His career looked to be over with Chicago; however, the trade to the Ducks instantly rejuvenated his career. After scoring just 4 goals with the Blackhawks, Thomas had 10 goals in the final 12 games of the season with the Ducks and added 4 more goals in the postseason as his team made it to their first Stanley Cup Finals. The Ducks had wanted to keep Thomas for 2003-2004 as well, but they ran out of money, and Thomas's absence negatively affected his former linemates.\nDespite being considered a great playoff player, Thomas was never able to capture a Stanley Cup in his career. He came close in 2002–03 when his Mighty Ducks of Anaheim made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, the first of his and the team's, but they lost to the New Jersey Devils in a hard-fought 7 games.\nThomas signed a one-year contract (2003–2004) with the Detroit Red Wings before the 2004–05 NHL lockout and proved effective playing on a line with youngster Pavel Datsyuk and Brett Hull. At one stretch in the season, Thomas had 10 points in 13 games, and he enjoyed more ice time than he initially expected due to injuries among the Wings' roster. The Wings finished first in the league but lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Calgary Flames.\nAfter the 2004–05 NHL lockout he was invited to the Toronto Maple Leafs tryout in 2005, but he was cut before the regular season started.\nTrades and signings.\nTraded to Chicago by Toronto with Rick Vaive and Bob McGill for Al Secord and Ed Olczyk, September 3, 1987. Traded to NY Islanders by Chicago with Adam Creighton for Brent Sutter and Brad Lauer, October 25, 1991. Traded to New Jersey by NY Islanders for Claude Lemieux, October 3, 1995. Signed as a free agent by Toronto, July 30, 1998. Signed as a free agent by Chicago. Traded to Anaheim by Chicago for Anaheim's 5th round choice (Chicago drafted Alexei Ivanov) in 2003 NHL Entry Draft, March 11, 2003. Signed as a free agent by Detroit, November 5, 2003.\nPost-playing career.\nThomas was an assistant/mentor coach for the St. Michael's Buzzers, a Jr. A team in Toronto.\nOn September 3, 2010, Thomas was named player development consultant for the Tampa Bay Lightning, working with former Red Wings teammate Steve Yzerman, who served as Tampa Bay's general manager. Thomas monitored and oversaw all of Tampa Bay's prospects. He later worked as an assistant coach for the Lightning from 2012 to 2016.\nThomas was named an assistant coach with the St. Louis Blues on June 30, 2016. He spent one season on the Blues' staff.\nPersonal life.\nThomas and his wife Lori have two children, a daughter Lauren (born 1994), and a son Christian (born 1992), who is currently playing for HC Bozen-Bolzano of the Austrian Hockey League. Christian Thomas was drafted 40th overall by the New York Rangers in the 2nd round of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. Lauren married current Edmonton Oilers forward Adam Henrique. In his third OHL season in 2010–11, Christian finished second in the league with 54 goals and sixth in the league in scoring with 99 points, while also tying for the league lead in power-play goals. Steve and Christian Thomas are the first father-son combination to each score 50 goals in a single OHL season.\nTrivia.\nThomas appeared in the 1986 hockey-themed movie Youngblood alongside Rob Lowe and Keanu Reeves and, in one scene, is memorably towel-snapped by Patrick Swayze."

This was the shortest final on record and it was reported that Hartley was suffering from an attack of 'English cholera'. Hartley did not compete in the 1882 championships and made a final return at the 1883 championships, losing in the second round to Herbert Wilberforce in four sets.\nIn 1926, at the Golden Jubilee championships, Hartley was presented with a silver medal by Queen Mary, as one of 34 surviving champions.\nEarly life.\nHartley was born in 1849, second son of John Hartley (died 1884) and his wife Emma, daughter of ironmaster George Benjamin Thorneycroft of Wolverhampton. His parents were both of south Staffordshire industrial business families, his father's family owned the glass making firm of Hartley Chance &amp; Company of Smethwick, while the Thorneycrofts founded Shrubbery Ironworks in Wolverhampton, in which his father became a partner. He grew up at Tong Castle in Shropshire, which his father leased from the Earl of Bradford in 1856.\nIn 1867, Hartley matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1870, and M.A. in 1874.\nHartley married Alice Margaret Lascelles Murray, daughter of William Murray, 4th Earl of Mansfield and a granddaughter of Henry Lascelles, 3rd Earl of Harewood, in 1875. They had no children.\nCareer outside sport.\nHartley was a clergyman with the Church of England, and he was ordained deacon in 1872 and priest in 1873 by the bishop of Winchester and served from 1872 to 1874 as curate of Christ Church, Southwark in south London.

        "title": "Reverse (American football)",
        "text": "A reverse (sometimes referred to as an end reverse or criss cross) is a relatively common trick play in American football that involves one or more abrupt changes in the lateral flow of a rushing play.\nHistory.\nThe invention of the reverse is credited to Amos Alonzo Stagg. The invention of the \"naked\" reverse, i. e. a reverse run to the weak side, is credited to Pop Warner.\nVariations.\nA classic reverse typically begins as a bootleg, sweep or end-around, but before the ball-carrier crosses the line of scrimmage he hands the ball off to a teammate, usually a wide receiver, running in the reverse (opposite) direction. Because many of the defensive players will have gravitated in the direction of the original rusher, if the second ball-carrier can outrun the defenders to the other side of the field, he has a very good chance to make a big gain.\nA variation of this play is a \"double reverse\", in which the second ball-carrier takes the ball all or part way back across the field before he too hands off to a teammate running in the opposite direction. This causes the flow of the play to \"reverse\" a second time. A double reverse adds another level of surprise to the defense; however, the play takes more time and space to develop and increases the risk of a big loss or a fumbled handoff.\nAnother variation is the \"reverse option\". On a reverse option, the second ball-carrier runs for a few steps, then (optionally) passes the ball downfield to a teammate, similar to a halfback option play.\nMany teams will also use the threat of a reverse to gain an advantage on simple sweep plays. In such a case, the quarterback might pitch the ball to the running back, who will fake a handoff or lateral to a teammate running in the opposite direction. The distraction is sometimes enough for the running back to gain an edge in getting past the defense.\nTerminology.\nSometimes an end-around, in which the only handoff is from a stationary quarterback to a wide receiver, is imprecisely called a \"reverse\". An end-around is not a reverse because the lateral flow of the play does not change direction. However, it has become commonplace for fans, sportswriters, announcers, and even coaches and players to refer to any end-around as a 'reverse', and to an end-around reverse as a 'double reverse.'"

        "text": "Robert John Pack Jr. (born February 3, 1969) is an American professional basketball coach and former player. He last coached the Rwandan club REG of the Basketball Africa League A point guard, he played 13 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nHigh school and college career.\nPack attended Alfred Lawless High School in New Orleans. He was a high school teammate of future NBA player Eldridge Recasner and graduated from Lawless in 1987. He then attended Tyler Junior College for two years, transferred to the University of Southern California in 1989, and graduated with a degree in sociology in 1991. He averaged 13.4 points per game and 5.3 assists in his two seasons at USC.\nProfessional career.\nEarly career.\nPack was not drafted by an NBA team, rather he began his career by being signed as a free agent by the Portland Trail Blazers on September 16, 1991. He made the team by beating out veteran Walter Davis and played 72 games for the Blazers as a rookie, averaging 4.6 points/game in 12.4 MPG as he was entrenched behind veterans Terry Porter and Danny Ainge. The Blazers went to the NBA Finals that year, before losing the series, 4–2, to the Chicago Bulls. During the 1992 off-season, after the Blazers signed free agent point guard Rod Strickland, Pack was traded to the Nuggets for a 1993 second-round draft pick.\nMid-career.\nPack spent three seasons with the Nuggets from 1992–93 until 1994–95, with his minutes and games started increasing each season. On March 18, 1993, Pack set a then-career-high with 27 points while coming off the bench in a 105-101 loss to the Boston Celtics. He was part of a young Nuggets team starring Dikembe Mutombo, LaPhonso Ellis and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf that became the first eighth-seeded team in NBA history to defeat the first-seeded team as the Nuggets defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round of the 1994 Western Conference Playoffs. Pack was then traded to the Washington Bullets for Doug Overton and Don MacLean on October 30, 1995. Injuries slowed Pack during the prime years of his career, as he never played a full 82-game season. In 31 games for the Bullets, Pack averaged 18.1 ppg, 7.8 apg, 4.3 rpg and 2.00 spg in what was his best season statistically. Prior to the 1996–97 season he was signed by the New Jersey Nets before being traded mid-season to the Dallas Mavericks along with Shawn Bradley, Ed O'Bannon and Khalid Reeves for Sam Cassell, Chris Gatling, Jim Jackson, George McCloud and Eric Montross. Pack remained with the Mavericks through the end of the 1999–00 season, never playing more than the 54 games he played in 1996–97 as injuries slowed his career.\nLate career.\nPack returned to the Nuggets for the 2000–01 season after being traded by the Mavericks via the Boston Celtics. He played 74 games that season, starting 11 of them as a replacement for starting point guard Nick Van Exel. The Minnesota Timberwolves signed him in the off-season and he played 16 games for them in 2001–02. His final two seasons in the NBA were as a veteran backup point guard off the bench for the New Orleans Hornets (2002–03) and the New Jersey Nets (2003–04). On October 2, 2005, Pack signed a contract with the Toronto Raptors for a tryout with the team. His stint with the Raptors was short-lived as he was cut by the team on October 22.\nHe finished his NBA career and from 2004 to 2005 he played in Žalgiris Kaunas in Lithuania.\nCoaching career.\nIn August 2009, Pack joined the New Orleans Hornets as an assistant coach. He became an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers the next season. On July 31, 2013, he became an assistant coach for the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nOn June 22, 2015, he returned to the now New Orleans Pelicans as an assistant coach.\nOn October 10, 2018, Pack joined the Washington Wizards as assistant coach.\nOn February 18, 2022, Pack was announced as the new head coach of the Rwandan club REG ahead of the Basketball Africa League (BAL).\nOther.\nPack was known as one of the game's better dunkers during the first half of the 1990s and one of the more spectacular in-game dunkers of all-time among smaller players, due largely to his outstanding vertical leap and lateral quickness. He finished second in the 1994 NBA Slam Dunk Contest during the NBA All-Star Weekend in Minneapolis, Minnesota, behind Isaiah Rider.\nHe achieved two triple-doubles in his career.\nPhilanthropy.\nIn November 2016, Pack and Percy \"Master P\" Miller formed Team H.O.P.E. NOLA, an acronym for “Helping Our Players Excel.” Its players were twenty at-risk males between the ages of 12–15 and chosen from New Orleans-area schools."

        "text": "Love &amp; Basketball is a 2000 American romantic sports drama film written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood in her feature film directorial debut. The film is produced by Spike Lee and Sam Kit and stars Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps. It tells the story of Quincy McCall (Epps) and Monica Wright (Lathan), two next-door neighbors in Los Angeles, who are pursuing their respective basketball careers before eventually falling for each other.\n\"Love &amp; Basketball\" was released on April 21, 2000 in the United States. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise directed at the performances of Lathan and Epps, Prince-Bythewood's direction and script, and the emotional weight of the film. It grossed $27.7 million worldwide on a production budget of $14–20 million.\nOver the years, the film has developed a dedicated following, cementing its place in popular culture, and establishing itself as a cult classic.\nIn 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"\nPlot.\nThe story is divided into four quarters, each one representing a different period in the lives of the protagonists. The first quarter takes place in 1981, when Monica and Quincy are children and become friends due to their shared love for basketball. Monica proves to be an excellent player, beating Quincy in their first game of one on one. However, their friendship is threatened when Quincy knocks Monica down during a game, accidentally cutting her face. They reconcile and share their first kiss, but their relationship is complicated.\nThe second quarter is set in 1988 when Monica and Quincy are attending Crenshaw High School. Quincy is a star basketball player, and Monica is the leader of the girls' basketball team. Quincy is popular and dates the prettiest girl in school, while Monica struggles to control her emotions on the court and harbors feelings for Quincy. However, they manage to connect romantically and make love after both being accepted at the University of Southern California.\nThe third quarter begins when they start college, and Quincy is a promising player on the court while Monica frequently has run-ins with her head coach Ellie Davis and struggles to get playing time on the women's team. Quincy struggles to deal with the media attention and discovers his father's infidelity. The pressures of their athletic and academic commitments, coupled with their deteriorating relationship, cause them to break up.\nThe fourth quarter follows the plot to 1993, a few years before the establishment of the WNBA. Monica and Quincy are both professional basketball players. Monica plays for an International Women's Basketball Association (IWBA) team in Barcelona while Quincy is in his fifth year as a player for the Los Angeles Lakers. After visiting Quincy in the hospital following a devastating knee injury, Monica learns he is engaged to be married. She also confronts her mother, Camille, about their troubled past. Quincy recovers from his injury and his wedding draws closer, while Monica quits basketball to work at a bank. Camille encourages Monica to pursue her dreams and Quincy and Monica play a high stakes one-on-one game, with Quincy agreeing to call off the wedding if he loses. Although Quincy wins, he realizes he can't live without Monica and chooses her instead. The two get married and have a daughter. Monica later plays in the WNBA.\nIn a post-credits scene, Quincy and Monica's daughter is shown playing basketball at a playground.\nProduction.\nIn writing the semi-autobiographical film, Prince-Bythewood said her goal was \"to do a black \"When Harry Met Sally\".\" She has credited executive producer Spike Lee with enabling the production of the film and the opportunity to direct her own script. Gabrielle Union, who wound up playing Quincy's high school love interest, originally auditioned for the lead role of Monica. Prior to playing Monica, Sanaa Lathan had never played basketball. Unbeknownst to Prince-Bythewood, stars Lathan and Omar Epps had started dating prior to the film's production.\nThis was the second film to feature both Epps and Dennis Haysbert; prior to this, they played teammates on a fictitious version of the Cleveland Indians in the 1994 baseball movie \"Major League II\".\nMusic.\n\"Love &amp; Basketball\" is the soundtrack to the film, released April 18, 2000, on Overbrook Entertainment and Interscope Records. Production for the album came from several recording artists, including Raphael Saadiq, Angie Stone, Zapp, and Steve \"Silk\" Hurley. In the US, the album peaked at number 45 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 15 on R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. Stacia Proefrock of Allmusic gave the album a three-of-five star review, saying, \"Songs like Meshell Ndegeocello's 'Fool of Me' help punctuate this story of childhood friends who love each other almost as much as they love the game of basketball. Other highlights of the soundtrack include songs from MC Lyte, Al Green, and Rufus.\"\nReception.\nCritical response.\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 85% based on 113 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Confident directing and acting deliver an insightful look at young athletes.\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\nFilm critic Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave \"Love &amp; Basketball\" an A− review. She enjoyed how the film portrayed women's sports in general and said, \"The speed and wiliness of the game itself ensure that movies about men who shoot hoops are exciting, but the novelty of watching women bring their own physical grace to the contest is a turn-on.\"\nRachel Deahl of AllRovi gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. In her review she complimented Epps and Lathan on their performances, and said, \"\"Love &amp; Basketball\" serves as a somber reminder of how few films exist (much less love stories, much less ones that focus on the female perspective) about multi-dimensional African-American characters outside the ghetto.\" Film critic Desson Thomson of \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"\"Love and Basketball\" had moments of such tenderness and sophistication, complimented by such romantic dreaminess between lead performers Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan. First-time filmmaker Gina Prince-Bythewood's film joins such films as \"The Best Man\" and \"The Wood\", which look for the class, not the crass, in African American life.\"\n\"New York Post\" critic Jonathan Foreman gave the film a mixed review; he appreciated how the film \"effectively conveys the excitement of basketball from a player's point of view\", but opined the film is \"filled with fake-sounding dialogue you only find in the cheesiest TV movies.\" Roger Ebert, film critic for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", wrote, \"The film is not as taut as it could have been, but I prefer its emotional perception to the pumped-up sports clichés I was sort of expecting. It's about the pressures of being a star athlete; the whole life, not the game highlights. I'm not sure I quite believe the final shot, though. I think the girl suits up for the sequel.\" Ebert gave the film three out of four stars. Robert Wilonsky of the \"Dallas Observer\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"[it] is a film built upon transitions so weak and obvious it's astonishing the entire thing doesn't collapse on itself. You want to root for it, as you would any rookie underdog, but it offers nothing to cheer for.\" Of the acting, he stated, \"Omar Epps possesses a chiseled body and a blank stare [...] Lathan is only slightly better, but she's stuck in a hollow role.\"\nA 2015 review of the film by The A.V. Club praises it as a \"nearly perfect modern romantic drama\", and notes that it is an impressive debut for writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood. The review highlights the film's focus on the protagonist, Monica, and her coming-of-age story as a female basketball player who is constantly told that her body type and attitude are unacceptable. The review also notes the film's respect for Monica's athleticism, which is captured in every frame, and praises the director's tender and celebratory gaze towards her female lead. \nBox office.\n\"Love &amp; Basketball\" was released in North America on April 21, 2000 to 1,237 theaters. It grossed $3,176,000 its first day and ending its North American weekend with $8,139,180, which was the second-highest grossing movie of the April 21–23, 2000 weekend, only behind \"U-571\". \"Love &amp; Basketball\" grossed $27,459,615 in the United States, which is ninth all-time for a basketball film and thirty-seventh all-time for a sports drama.

        "title": "Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970",
        "text": "In the 1970 English cricket season, a scheduled South African tour was cancelled for political reasons. As this meant there would be no international cricket in England that season, a Rest of the World team was assembled to play a series of five-day matches against England. At the time, they were played as Test matches, but that status was later revoked by the International Cricket Conference (ICC) and they are now termed unofficial Tests, though still officially first-class matches.\nThe World XI, captained by Garfield Sobers, convincingly won the first Test by an innings but the other four matches were keenly contested and England, captained by Ray Illingworth, performed to a high standard against opponents who were world-class in ability as well as name. The series result was a 4–1 win by the World XI.\nBackground.\nSouth Africa, who had just defeated Australia four-nil in a home series, were due to tour England during the 1970 season. The controversy created by the D'Oliveira affair in 1968 had escalated in the meantime with increasing opposition to the South African government's apartheid policy. A \"Stop The Seventy Tour\" campaign was started, its leaders including Gordon Brown and Peter Hain, and a South African rugby tour in early 1970 was disrupted by protests at many of its matches. Prominent opponents of apartheid within cricket included John Arlott, Mike Brearley and David Sheppard, but a vote among members of the Cricketers' Association indicated widespread support for continued sporting links with South Africa. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" described the situation in terms of \"a bitter, emotional – sometimes hysterical – aura hanging over English cricket and dividing the nation\".\nThe Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), who ran English cricket at the time, received a request from Home Secretary James Callaghan to cancel the tour \"on grounds of broad public policy\". The TCCB reluctantly agreed and the invitation to the South African team was withdrawn. This meant there would be no international cricket in England in 1970 with a concomitant loss of revenue and so, at very short notice, a Rest of the World team was formed, including five South African players. Another two South Africans, Tony Greig and Basil D'Oliveira, who were resident in England, played for the home team. Guinness agreed to sponsor the tour and the County Championship clubs agreed to release any of their contracted players who were selected to play for either England or the World XI.\nThe England v. Rest of the World XI series was initially recognised as a Test series by \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", but the International Cricket Conference (ICC) stated at their 1972 meeting that the games should not be regarded as official Test matches. \"Wisden\" continued to include the matches as Tests until removing them for the 1980 edition against the wishes of the editor, Norman Preston.\nRest of the World squad.\nRest of the World, captained by Garfield Sobers, selected 14 players in the series including five South Africans who, despite apartheid at home, were happy to play alongside five West Indians and three players from the Indian sub-continent. Several players were already active in England as contracted members of County Championship clubs. Squad details below state the player's age at the beginning of the 1970 season, his batting hand, his type of bowling, his national team and where applicable his county club.\nEngland selections.\nEngland selected 21 players for the series. All except Alan Jones played in official Test matches in other series and Jones is the only man in cricketing history to win a Test cap and then lose it. Other England debutants were Tony Greig, Peter Lever, Brian Luckhurst, Chris Old and Ken Shuttleworth. The details for each player below state his age at the beginning of the 1970 season, his batting hand, his type of bowling and his County Championship club.\nMatches.\nThe Rest of the World XI were 4–1 winners of the five-match Test series but, despite a comprehensive defeat in the opening match, England were not outclassed and won the second Test to level the series with three to play. The World XI won the three remaining matches but in one case by only two wickets and the others by four and five wickets. \"Wisden\" was impressed by the quality of the World XI and said that \"possibly only the Australian sides of 1921 and 1948 could have risen to the heights attained by The Rest\", and England \"proved worthy opponents\". \"Wisden\" mentioned \"a curious feature being that in all the five matches victory went to the side that fielded first\".\nFirst Test.\n\"Wisden\" commented that, with England having been completely outclassed in this opening match, \"few could have expected the four following games to be so closely contested\". The match started, unusually, on a Wednesday so that the Thursday could be a \"rest day\" for the general election. The outstanding performer was Gary Sobers who had first forged a bond between his multi-national players so that they became a formidable team rather than, as some had predicted, a collection of star-name individuals. Sobers then destroyed England's batting on the first morning, taking six for 21. Ray Illingworth batted well for a defiant 63 but, overall, it was a disastrous batting performance with England sorely missing the absent Geoff Boycott and John Edrich. Eddie Barlow with 119 demonstrated the sort of concentration that Boycott and Edrich might have provided. On Friday afternoon, Sobers and Intikhab Alam scored 197 together in the final two and a half hours of the day, the World XI completing a massive first innings lead of 419 on Saturday morning. England did better in their second innings and Illingworth fell (to Sobers) six short of a well-deserved century. Intikhab took the bowling honours with six for 113 and England were well beaten by an innings and 80 runs with a whole day to spare. Umpire Syd Buller, who died suddenly on 7 August, officiated in his last international match.\nSecond Test.\n\"Wisden\" suggested the vagaries of the English weather as the deciding factor in this match which, contrary to expectations, was won by England. Cool, damp conditions on the first three days favoured the seam bowlers who were able to make the ball \"swing freely\". The main exponents were Basil D'Oliveira and Tony Greig (on debut) for England and Eddie Barlow for the World XI. Key innings were played by Clive Lloyd for the World and Ray Illingworth for England which left the match finely poised after completion of first innings, England having a slender lead of three runs. Barlow dominated proceedings on the Saturday and his defiant 142 accounted for virtually half his team's second innings total. D'Oliveira and Greig were again the best of the bowlers. The World innings ended on Monday morning and England had seven sessions in which to score 284. The weather had improved over the weekend and Monday was a bright day which produced a slow-paced pitch. Even so, England were still without Geoff Boycott and their batsmen proceeded with caution, especially Brian Luckhurst who batted for seven hours and played a \"dogged innings\" of 113 not out to see England home with four hours to spare on Tuesday.\nThird Test.\n\"Wisden\" recalled that there was news off the field during this match because the England selectors met to decide which of Ray Illingworth or Colin Cowdrey, both playing in the match, would lead the team on the coming winter tour of Australia. Illingworth was chosen and he rewarded their faith in him by leading England to Ashes victory. In the current match, however, England struggled against formidable opponents who were determined to avenge their defeat at Nottingham. England were still without Geoff Boycott and fielded an unchanged team at Edgbaston. The World XI selected Peter Pollock and Deryck Murray in place of Graham McKenzie and Farokh Engineer. England were reduced to 76 for four in their first innings but Basil D'Oliveira led a recovery with help from Illingworth and Tony Greig. D'Oliveira made 110 and England reached what seemed a creditable 294. Despite the early loss of Eddie Barlow, the strength of the World XI batting is illustrated by the fact that no less than eight of them scored 40. The highlight was a fifth wicket partnership of 175 between Clive Lloyd (101) and Gary Sobers (80). England made a game of it on the last two days, exemplified by a stubborn last wicket stand of 45 between Alan Knott and John Snow. The World needed 141 to win in 195 minutes and struggled to get them. England reduced them to 107 for five but then Intikhab Alam and Mike Procter took control and quickly scored the remaining 34 runs.\nFourth Test.\nGeoff Boycott returned to the England team and, with perhaps a nod towards the venue, the selectors also picked his Yorkshire colleagues Don Wilson and the 21-year-old Chris Old. The World XI decided to strengthen their batting and Mushtaq Mohammad replaced Peter Pollock. Gary Sobers won the toss and \"Wisden\" recalled that he gambled by putting England in to bat \"on a slow-drying pitch\". Having struggled to reach 209 for four after a very poor start, England disintegrated completely in the face of a remarkable piece of bowling by Eddie Barlow who took four wickets in five balls, emulating the feat of Maurice Allom in New Zealand in 1930–31. Barlow dismissed Keith Fletcher, England's top scorer, and Alan Knott came in to bat. Barlow dismissed Knott second ball and then completed a hat trick by dismissing Chris Old and Don Wilson with his next two deliveries. The World XI's batting was impacted by back injuries sustained by Barry Richards and Rohan Kanhai while fielding. Richards could not open the innings so Deryck Murray was promoted and he scored a determined 95 in five hours but the World XI were on 152 for four when Gary Sobers came in to rally them, in \"Wisden's\" words, \"with another splendid century\". Once again, England staged a second innings recovery with half-centuries by Boycott, Brian Luckhurst, Fletcher and Ray Illingworth. Barlow with five for 78 completed a match analysis of twelve for 142. Needing 223 to win with a day and a half to go, the World XI slumped to 62 for five on the Monday afternoon. This brought Sobers and Intikhab together and they survived to the close with the overnight score at 75 for five. They needed another 148 to win and two of their remaining batsmen were the injured Kanhai and Richards. On Tuesday morning, a crucial incident occurred at 82 for five when Tony Greig at second slip dropped Intikhab off John Snow. \"Wisden\" reckoned that England would have won and squared the series if the catch had been taken. Intikhab and Sobers steadily moved the score forward until both were out shortly before lunch. Kanhai, batting despite his injury, was out immediately after lunch and the World XI were then on 183 for eight with 40 more needed. Richards, who had been out of action since Thursday, came out to join Mike Procter and these two settled the match and the series.\n\"ESPNcricinfo\" has a World XI team photograph from this match. The players are: (back row; left to right) Deryck Murray, Barry Richards, Clive Lloyd, Mike Procter, Intikhab Alam, Mushtaq Mohammad; (front row; left to right) Rohan Kanhai, Eddie Barlow, Gary Sobers, Lance Gibbs, Graeme Pollock.\nFifth Test.\n\"Wisden\" remarked on the \"quality of the cricket\" and highlighted \"four notable individual performances in a match which brought a magnificent series to a distinguished close\". England scored 294 in the first innings after winning the toss, Ray Illingworth completing his sixth half-century of the series. Graham McKenzie took three wickets in eight balls to reduce England from 266 for six to 266 for nine. The World XI responded with 355 which featured \" a batting spectacle\" by Graeme Pollock and Gary Sobers, who added 165 for the fifth wicket. England's best bowler was Peter Lever whose \"command of perfect length and direction\" enabled him to take seven wickets on debut. In England's second innings, Geoff Boycott produced a \"masterly innings of 157 which gave England a chance of victory\". It was not enough, however, against such world-class opposition and a century by Rohan Kanhai, well supported by Clive Lloyd and Gary Sobers, enabled the World XI to complete a 4–1 series victory. Sobers scored the winning runs to complete a series \"in which he had been the dominant figure\".\nT. N. Pearce's XI v Rest of the World XI (5–8 September).\nThis was an extra match played at the Scarborough Festival but it featured only seven of the players who appeared in the Test matches: Mushtaq, Kanhai, Murray and Gibbs for the World XI; Boycott, Amiss and Old for T. N. Pearce's XI. Kanhai and Roger Prideaux were the team captains. The match, played at North Marine Road Ground, was drawn.\nAftermath.\nEngland went to Australia the following winter and, in a controversial series, won The Ashes for the first time since Richie Benaud's team had beaten them in the 1958–59 series. England under Ray Illingworth were actually one of the most successful Test teams of all time. They created a world record in official Test cricket of 27 consecutive Tests without defeat from 1968 to 1971; the record was equaled by Clive Lloyd's West Indies team between 1981 and 1984. At the time, however, the Rest of the World Tests were recognised as official and England's record run has only been confirmed retrospectively. England took sixteen players on tour and fourteen of these had featured against the Rest of the World. The other two were reserve wicket-keeper Bob Taylor and Yorkshire batsman John Hampshire. Alan Ward had to return home because of injury problems and was replaced by the young fast bowler Bob Willis, who made his Test debut on the tour.\nAnother scheduled South African tour, this time to Australia, was cancelled in 1971 and the Rest of the World team was recreated, again under the captaincy of Gary Sobers. Besides Sobers, the squad included six other 1970 team members: Farokh Engineer, Intikhab Alam, Rohan Kanhai, Clive Lloyd and the Pollock brothers. It also included four England players: Norman Gifford, Tony Greig, Richard Hutton and Bob Taylor. The World XI won this series 2–1. As there were no more scheduled South African tours, the need for a World XI lapsed and it was many years before the concept was resurrected. South Africa as a team were banned from international cricket while the apartheid system existed, though many individual South African players were able to take part in the major domestic competitions of other countries. South Africa was reinstated by the ICC in 1991 and returned to Test match cricket in April 1992.\nIn June 2020, Alan Jones was recognised as an England Test cricketer by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), with the ECB awarding him with cap number 696, fifty years after the match."

        "text": "William Richard Campbell (August 9, 1948 – January 6, 2023) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1973 to 1987. He played for the American League (AL) Minnesota Twins, Boston Red Sox, and Detroit Tigers and the National League (NL) Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, and Montreal Expos.\nEarly life.\nCampbell was born in Highland Park, Michigan, and raised in Pomona, California. He graduated from Ganesha High School in Pomona, and attended Mt. San Antonio College.\nAfter being drafted for military service in 1968, Campbell joined the United States Army. He served as a radio operator in Vietnam during the Vietnam War and was discharged in 1970.\nStart of career.\nNicknamed \"Soup\" after the Campbell Soup Company, Campbell was signed as an amateur free agent pitcher by the Twins and began his career with the Class A minor league Wisconsin Rapids in 1971. In 1972, he moved up to Minnesota's AA level Charlotte affiliate, and in 1973 he started the season with AAA Tacoma and had 10 wins and 5 losses when he was called up to the major leagues in July.\nCampbell made his Twins debut on July 14, 1973, in relief of Jim Kaat. He pitched one scoreless inning, and allowed one hit to the Cleveland Indians, while striking out two. Used primarily in relief, he posted a record in 1973 of 3 wins and 3 losses in 28 games, with an earned run average of 3.18. In 1974, Campbell pitched in 63 games, all in relief, and compiled an 8–7 record with 19 saves and a 2.62 ERA. In 1975, he started slowly after a spring training arm injury, and split time between relieving and starting. His overall record was 4 wins and 6 losses, with 5 saves and a 3.79 ERA. In 1976, new manager Gene Mauch named Campbell as his closer. Campbell rose to the occasion; his 78 appearances led the league, and his record was 17 wins, 5 losses, 20 saves, and a 3.01 ERA. He finished 7th in the voting for that year's Cy Young award, and 8th in the voting for Most Valuable Player.\nCampbell became a free agent after the 1976 season and signed a four-year contract with the Boston Red Sox. He finished with 13 wins, 9 losses, 31 saves, and an ERA of 2.96. He was selected for the AL All-Star team, and won both the AL Fireman of the Year (awarded by \"The Sporting News\") and Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award. Campbell was the first American league recipient of the Rolaids award, and the first two-time winner. Campbell experienced arm trouble in 1978, and was no longer the dominating closer he had been in 1976 and 1977.\nOn March 26, 1984, the Cubs traded Campbell and Mike Diaz to the Philadelphia Phillies for Gary Matthews, Porfi Altamirano, and Bob Dernier. On April 6, 1985, the Phillies traded Campbell and Iván DeJesús to the St. Louis Cardinals for Dave Rucker. He was released by the Cardinals after the 1985 season and signed with the Detroit Tigers for the 1986 season. He signed with the Montreal Expos for the 1987 season, but was released on May 1.\nLater life and death.\nAfter leaving the major leagues, Campbell spent two seasons with the Senior Professional Baseball Association. According to 1987 news articles, Campbell was among those who were swindled by sports agent LaRue Harcourt, and lost approximately $800,000. He remained involved in baseball, and served on the coaching staff of the Milwaukee Brewers in 1999. In retirement, he was a resident of the Chicago area. He also coached for the Red Sox organization and was a volunteer coach for youth baseball leagues.\nCampbell died from cancer under hospice care in Palatine, Illinois, on January 6, 2023, at the age of 74."

        "text": "Tennis Australia Limited is the governing body for tennis in Australia. It is owned by Australian states and territories. The association organizes national and international tennis tournaments including the Australian Open, Australian Open Series, Davis Cup, Billie Jean King Cup, ATP Cup, and Australian Pro Tour. In addition, the association takes the responsibility to facilitate tennis at all levels from grassroots to elite development. Tennis Australia's state-based member associates carry out the promotion, management, and development of Tennis within Australia. Other than that, it administers amateur tournaments and youth development programs.\nTennis Australia's headquarters is located in Melbourne, Australia. It administers Tennis projects throughout Australia employing approximately 716 full-time staff. The association generates income from selling tournament tickets, selling TV rights, and through sponsorship from companies.\nThe organization was formulated and incorporated in 1904. In 1904, it operated as the Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia. However, the name was changed to the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia in 1906. Finally, in 1986, the name was changed to Tennis Australia (TA).\nHistory of Tennis in Australia.\nThe exact origin of tennis in Australia is not known. Many believe the ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome initiated racket and ball games like the current tennis. Others argue that France and England introduced tennis around the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1875, a meeting was held in England that determined a standardized set of rules for the sport of Lawn Tennis. In January 1880, Australia hosted its first tennis tournament at the Melbourne Cricket Club. In the following 20 years, the popularity of Tennis grew among wealthy Australians. In 1904, Australia required a governing body for Tennis in Australia. The state representatives formed the Australasian Lawn Tennis Association for both Australia and New Zealand.\nThe purpose of the Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia in 1904, was to organize the Davis Cup and the Australasian Championships. In 1926, the association moved to Melbourne from Sydney and began to trade as the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia. It was managed by Sir Norman Brookes until 1955. As tennis grew in popularity around the world during the 1970s and 1980s, the association formed a company and remanded Tennis Australia in 1986.\nMajor Tournaments Hosted by Tennis Australia.\nAustralian Open.\nThe Australian Open, formerly known as the Happy Slam, is one of the major tennis tournaments hosted by Tennis Australia. Along with the US Open, French Open, and Wimbledon, the Australian Open is classified as a Grand Slam. The Australian Open is held annually in Melbourne for about two weeks. The categories of the tournament include women's and men's singles; men's mixed doubles; Junior Championships; the exhibition and legends; and wheelchair events. In 2019, the Australian Open experienced record attendance of more than 780,000 fans. The Australian Open's attendance rate has increased by 13% from 2015. This is the highest increase among the four slams. This way the Australian Open Tournaments contribute to the hosting state's economy. The 2020 tournaments, for example, created 1775 jobs and generated AU$ 387.7 million worth of Real Gross State Product. The 2020 tournaments also distributed AU$ 71 million worth of prize money. The winners of the Australian Open are awarded with prize money of AU$ 4.1 million as well as trophies with their name inscribed on it.\nThe first Australian Open was held in 1905 with only seventeen participants. By 1924, the Australian Open was a national event and it was hosted by different states every year. Since 1972, the Australian Open has only been held in Melbourne, Victoria. Women's tennis tournaments were only included in the Australian Open from 1922. In 1969, the Australian Open allowed all players and professionals to compete in the tournament.\nThe Australian Open Series.\nThe Australian Open Series tournaments are pro tournaments held prior to the start of the Australian Open tournament. The Series’ tournaments include:\nThe ATP Cup.\nThe ATP Cup is a men's team competition that is annually hosted in Australia by Tennis Australia. Players from 24 different countries participate in the ATP Cup. The tournaments are held in the NSW Tennis Centre at Sydney Olympic Park before the Australian Open. The total prize money of US$15 million is distributed to the winners. The players can also win up to 750 singles and 250 doubles ATP ranking points.\nThe Davis Cup.\nThe Davis Cup is a Men's International Tennis Tournament organized annually by various countries. It is owned and regulated by the International Tennis Foundation and Kosmos Tennis Group. Tennis Australia frequently hosts the Davis Cup for Australia. It hosted 12 Davis Cup contests from 1946 to 2017. The 2017 Davis Cup held at the Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club was the most recent Davis Cup played in Australia.\nFed Cup / Billie Jean King Cup.\nLike the Davis Cup, the Fed Cup is the world's largest women's international team championship. 116 countries participate in the Fed Cup and the top 12 countries compete in the finals. The tournaments run for over one week. In 2020, it was renamed the Billie Jean King Cup after the 10-time winning champion Billie Jean King. The most recent Fed Cup hosted by Tennis Australia was in 2019 in Perth, WA. The event considerably contributed to the state's economy. It attracted more than 3000 people to Perth who spent AU$ 4.5 million. Also, as the tournament was broadcast internationally, it highlighted the state's attractions to international tourists. This would help boost WA's tourism markets in the future.\nThe Australian Pro Tour.\nThe Australian Pro Tour includes Pro Tour events, Australian Money Tournaments, and the Asia-Pacific Tennis League that run for 36 weeks every year. The participants receive 15,105 world ranking points and the finalists share US$111,500 in prize money. The tournaments provide opportunities for emerging tennis players to practice professional tennis as well as connect with international tennis professionals. The tournaments allow players to choose a wide range of categories including surfaces, venues, and circuits. The tournament also offers international participants an opportunity to explore the iconic areas of Australia as the tournaments are played across the nation in regional and metropolitan areas.\nFamous Australian Tennis Players.\nRod Laver\nRodney George Laver, an Australian Tennis legend, and the only player in the history of tennis to hold the Grand Slam twice. Laver was born in the sunshine state of Australia and nicknamed ‘Rocket’ by his coach Harry Hopman who was a Davis Cup captain. At the age of 17, in 1956, Laver won the US Junior Championship tournament. In 1962, Laver became the only second player to win the Grand Slam and in 1969, he won the Grand Slam again. Rod Laver was ranked the world's number-one tennis player for seven successive years from 1964 to 1970. Throughout his career, Laver won thirty-nine titles and had a winning record of about eighty percent. Laver retired from professional tennis in 1979 and was part of the International and Australian Tennis Halls of Fame between 1981 and 1993. In 2000, as a tribute to Rod Laver, the 'Centre Court' or 'Flinders Park' in Melbourne Park was named after him; the Rod Laver Arena.\nEvonne Goolagong Cawley\nEvonne Goolagong Cawley, part of the Wiradjuri Aboriginal tribe, held the title of women's world number one tennis player from 1971 to 1976. At the age of 13, Goolagong-Cawley moved to live with tennis coach Vic Edwards. In 1971, 20-year-old Goolagong-Cawley competed in the Wimbledon final against Australian Tennis champion Margaret Court and won the Wimbledon title. In 1972, Evonne Goolagong Cawley was named Australian of the Year. Evonne continued to win every Australian state title and Australian singles title in 1974, 1975, and 1976 as well as more Wimbledon titles. Hence, an English Journalist nicknamed her the ‘Sunshine Supergirl’. In 1991, Evonne Goolagong Cawley moved to Noosa and restored her connections with her Wiradjuri people, and got involved with Aboriginal affairs. In 2018 she was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Australia.\nTennis Australia's Support for Players.\nTennis Australia (TA) is involved with the local governments to support tennis at the grassroots. The local government owns 80 percent of tennis venues around Australia. Hence, TA recognizes and supports the local government's involvement in organizing tennis in the local community, parklands, and open spaces. Furthermore, TA and Local governments around Australia have developed four rules to ensure all of the tennis facilities meet the shared objective of the sport's governing body. The four rules are accountability, community benefit, sustainability, and accessibility.\nTypes of Tennis Matches organized by Tennis Australia.\nSingles\nThe tennis singles tournaments involve individual players competing against each other. Tennis Australia hosts various Tennis singles tournaments.\nDoubles\nThe tennis doubles tournaments include a pair of players on both sides of the net competing against each other. Both players move freely around their side of the court, between the double side-lines and baselines. Tennis Australia hosts men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles.\nInclusion and Diversity\nTennis Australia and its Member Associations are committed to embracing diversity. Tennis Australia provides an environment in which people of diverse backgrounds can participate and feel comfortable. It organizes Tennis tournaments for the Deaf &amp; Hard of Hearing, Intellectual Disability or Autism, Blind &amp; Low Vision, Wheelchair Tennis, and more.\nMoreover, as Tennis Australia aims to create a discrimination-free environment, it has published a book called ‘Tennis: Everybody Everywhere’. The booklet outlines the scenarios of discriminator language and behaviors as well as provides practical solutions to deal with participants from diverse backgrounds.\nFurthermore, Tennis Australia along with its Member Associations supports the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders through funding and promoting Indigenous Tennis Program (ITP). The ITP organizes programs that offer tennis coaching to the Indigenous communities. The ITP employs a holistic approach to support Indigenous Australians to become officials, coaches, and administrators. This ultimately ensures the interested participants have a satisfactory and safe tennis experience. Moreover, Tennis Australia holds an annual National Indigenous Tennis Carnival at the Darwin International Tennis Centre in which participants of all potential ages 10–18 are able to get involved. The carnival aims to celebrate the culture, music, and food through Tennis.\nTennis Australia - Awards.\nThe awards issued by Tennis Australia include the Newcombe Medal, Spirit of Tennis, Coaching Excellence – Performance, Coaching Excellence – Club, Coaching Excellence – Development, Junior Athlete of the Year, Most Outstanding Athlete with Disability, Volunteer Achievement Award, Most Outstanding 30+ Tennis Senior, Excellence in Officiating, Most Outstanding Tennis Club, Most Outstanding Australian Ranking Tournament, Most Outstanding Professional Tournament and Most Outstanding School.\nTennis Australia has been following a new nomination process since 2016.

It was the nation's best performance at the Winter Games prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\nOverview.\nAustralia's first ever Winter Olympic gold, also the first such medal won by a competitor from any Southern Hemisphere country and semitropical nation was won by Steven Bradbury in the 1000 m short track speed skating. Well off the pace of the medal favourites, Bradbury was positioned at the rear in the semifinal, only to see his competitors crash into each other, allowing him through to the final. Again well off the pace in the final all four other competitors crashed out at the final corner, leaving a shocked Bradbury to take the gold medal. Bradbury was also part of the 1994 relay team that won Australia's first Winter Olympics medal.\nAlisa Camplin, who hadn't won a world cup event before and was so nervous she didn't eat dinner the night before the final, won the second gold, in aerial skiing. Jacqui Cooper was previously a favourite, but she injured herself before the competition.\nJenny Owens had a top 10 result, finishing 9th in the combined downhill event, the second best performance by any Australian at an Olympic Games.\nAustralia competed in alpine skiing, figure skating, freestyle skiing, short track speed skating, and snowboarding. This was the fewest sports Australia had competed in since 1984. No Australian cross-country skiers competed in the Olympics for the first time since 1976, and no bobsledders competed for the first time since Australia's debut in 1988. Australian bobsledder Will Alstergren said \"We also beat half the teams currently in Salt Lake City, but unfortunately we couldn't meet the very high standard of the AOC, the Australian Olympic Committee\". Australian selection standards was also listed as a factor for Australia not competing in cross-country skiing at Salt Lake City.\nDuring the 2002 Winter Olympics, the Australian broadcaster, the Seven Network, included in its coverage an irreverent talk show called The Ice Dream, which interviewed several celebrities and promoted the Smiggin Holes 2010 Winter Olympic bid. Bradbury's and Camplin's triumphs were celebrated by Australia Post issuing stamps of them, which followed on from them issuing stamps of Australian gold medallists at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. They were produced by high-speed offset stamp-printing, unlike the digitally produced 2000 stamps. Bradbury's stamp was issued on 20 February, and Camplin's was issued on 22 February, four days after their respective victories. Each received A$20,000 for the use of their image. Bradbury said \"Should get me a car. I haven't had a car for a long time.\" and later described having a stamp issued as \"a great honour\". Camplin was also delighted, saying \"For us to be put in with the summer Olympians who had their stamps and the previous 39 sporting legends who've had their stamps is amazing.\"\nFreestyle skiing.\nAlisa Camplin provided Australia with its second gold medal for the games.\nShort track speed skating.\nSteven Bradbury won Australia's and the Southern Hemisphere's first Winter Olympics gold medal in the 1000 metres event. Richard Goerlitz also attended these games, but did not compete."

        "text": "Mervyn King (born 15 March 1966) is an English professional darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) tournaments. Nicknamed The King, he has reached seven PDC major finals and reached a peak of No. 4 in the PDC Order of Merit. He is also the 2004 World Master.\nEarly life.\nKing first took up the game at the age of 12, playing with an old rolled-cardboard dartboard given to him by his father. His father insisted that he played darts using competition distance and height. By the age of 13, he had ambitions to become a professional player as he was playing county darts at Superleague level. His first county A game was at the age of 14 and he won his local men's singles league at that age.\nAdditionally, King hit his first ever nine-dart leg of 501 aged 14 in a practice match with his father.\nBDO career.\nKing made his professional debut as a 28-year-old in the 1994 World Masters where he lost in the last 32 to Andy Fordham. His first title in the BDO came in the 1996 French Open where he beat Leo Laurens in the final. King has won several Open titles since he came onto the darts scene in 1995, including the Dutch Open in 1997. He made his debut at BDO World Darts Championship in 1997 as a 30-year-old. He reached the semi-final of the event beating Ronnie Baxter and Roland Scholten before losing to eventual champion Les Wallace. He won £8,700 for his performance.\nKing reached twelve major finals whilst playing in the BDO and converted only three of them into tournament victories. In 2004, he claimed his first BDO major title when he won the World Masters in Bridlington, defeating Tony O'Shea 7–6 in the final having trailed 3–5. His two other major victories to date have both taken place in the Netherlands. The first of these was the 2005 International Darts League, where he defeated O'Shea again in the final, this time by 13–11 in legs. Later the same year he added the Dutch Grand Masters beating Martin Adams 5–4 in the final.\nHis first major final came in the 2000 World Masters where he beat such players as Peter Manley and Colin Monk before eventually narrowly falling to John Walton 2 sets to 3. King went into the 2002 BDO World Darts Championship as number 4 in the event seedings and reached the final, losing to Australian Tony David. King beat Raymond van Barneveld in the quarter-finals 5–3 whilst averaging 101.67 before beating Colin Monk in the semi-finals to reach his first World Championship final. As well as winning £24,000 for reaching the final, he also earned a further £2,000 for a 170 finish, the highest checkout in the tournament.\n2003 proved to be a good year for King as he reached two major finals and the semi-final of the World Championships. He began the year with the 2003 BDO World Darts Championship and was seeded third for the tournament. He whitewashed Colin Monk 5 sets to 0 in the quarter-finals before losing out to Raymond van Barneveld in the semi-finals, denying him a second consecutive World Championship final appearance He went on to reach the finals of the 2003 International Darts League and World Darts Trophy losing out to Raymond van Barneveld on both occasions.\nIn 2004, King had another successful year as he reached two semi-finals and two finals, winning one, in the four BDO majors. He began the year ranked third in the seedings for the second consecutive year. In the 2004 BDO World Darts Championship, he narrowly beat Ritchie Davies 5 sets to 4 in the quarter-finals before convincingly beating Tony O'Shea in the semi-finals 5–1. Despite this he lost in the final for the second time in three years losing to Andy Fordham 3 sets to 6. After his good World Championship form he went on to reach the semi-finals of the 2004 International Darts League and World Darts Trophy narrowly losing to Tony David and Martin Adams 8–9 and 4–5 respectively. He ended the year winning his first BDO Major in the World Masters as he beat Tony David in the semi-finals 6–2 before winning the tournament prevailing against Tony O'Shea in a tight encounter which ended 7–6 in favour of King handing him his first major title after his sixth final.\nIn 2005, he had his worst World Championship performance in four years, as he made only the quarter-finals, losing out to André Brantjes 2 sets to 3. King spoke of his poor form and prior to the 2005 BDO World Darts Championship. King's next tournament that year was the International Darts League. He beat Ted Hankey, Co Stompé and Simon Whitlock before facing Tony O'Shea for the second time in a major final, and won 13–11 to secure his second major BDO title. Also in 2005, King made the final of the World Darts Trophy for the second time and on this occasion he was beaten again losing 4–6 against Gary Robson. This was to be King's last major final before his controversial switch to the Professional Darts Corporation.\nIn 2006, King's form declined and his best result came in the 2006 World Darts Trophy where he made the quarter-finals narrowly losing to Michael van Gerwen 4–5. He also made only the second round in the 2006 BDO World Darts Championship whitewashing Brian Woods 3 sets to 0 before losing to eventual champion Jelle Klaasen 2–4. His last tournament as a BDO affiliated player came in the 2007 BDO World Darts Championship where he made the semi-finals before losing 4–5 against eventual champion Martin Adams. King was surrounded by controversy during this tournament following speculation about his future and a possible switch to the PDC. This would prove to be his last tournament as a BDO player.\nPDC career.\nPDC switch and beginnings.\nKing's switch from the BDO to rival organization the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) created much debate and controversy. During the 2007 BDO World Darts Championship there was much speculation that King and three fellow BDO players (Michael van Gerwen, Jelle Klaasen and Vincent van der Voort) would be switching to the PDC after the World Championships. King was angry that rumours had surfaced and even threatened to quit the tournament as the speculation heightened even stating, \"I'm really not happy with the treatment I've had today, not just from one person but from a lot of people who I have known for many years\". Despite claiming to BDO press officer Robert Holmes that he would \"rather pack up darts than play for the PDC\" King announced his switch to the PDC on 6 February 2007 in a bid to \"further his career\". Having reached the semi-final of the 2007 BDO World Championships losing to eventual champion Martin Adams, King had signed a contract confirming he would play at the 2008 tournament due to a clause in all contracts of BDO players stating that if they reach the semi-finals of the World Championship they are obliged to return the following year, with champions committing themselves to three years. King's switch meant that the BDO threatened legal action against King.\nKing made his PDC debut at a non-televised event, the Southern Regional Final of the UK Open on 4 March 2007. He reached the quarter-finals before losing to Wayne Mardle.\nDuring his first year in the PDC, he performed well on the 2007 PDC Pro Tour, reaching one final, two semi-finals and four quarter-finals. He also gained a place in the 2007 World Matchplay where he reached the quarter-finals before losing to eventual champion James Wade. His performances in his first year helped him steadily climb the world rankings and qualify for his first PDC World Championship.\n2008.\nIn his debut at the 2008 PDC World Darts Championship, he fell to Dutchman Roland Scholten in the second round.\n2008 proved a successful year for King as he reached two semi-finals in PDC premier events as well as his maiden PDC premier final in the inaugural 2008 Championship League Darts where he lost 7–5 to Phil Taylor. \nHis first PDC title came at the Scottish Players Championship in Glasgow in April 2008 where he beat Taylor on his way to a 3–0 victory over Mark Dudbridge. He also won a Pro Tour title in the Netherlands, beating Raymond van Barneveld. He also had two semi-final appearances in the 2008 World Grand Prix and the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts losing to Raymond van Barneveld and Phil Taylor respectively. King ended the year and went into the 2009 PDC World Darts Championship as world number 13 in the PDC Order of Merit. His first year performances saw him win the Best Newcomer prize at the annual PDC awards dinner.\n2009.\nKing went into 2009 competing in the 2009 PDC World Darts Championship, and this turned out to be his best result in the PDC World Championship to date. He beat Barrie Bates in the quarter-finals before falling to Phil Taylor 2–6 with Taylor averaging 103.44. His performance in the World Championship meant that he moved up to 6 in the PDC Order of Merit and therefore qualified automatically for the 2009 Premier League Darts.\nKing carried on his good form into the 2009 World Matchplay in July. He defeated Mark Dudbridge, Steve Beaton and Vincent van der Voort before meeting Phil Taylor in the semi-final. Taylor prevailed 17–6, averaging 106.54, and went on to win the tournament. In the next PDC Premier event of the 2009 season, the 2009 European Championship, he reached the quarter-final before losing to James Wade 6–10. This was after beating Colin Osborne in the second round 9–6 recording a 104.00 average. King's successful run in the 2008 Championship League Darts continued into the 2009 tournament as he reached the semi-final before losing to eventual champion Colin Osborne 1–6.\nAlso in 2009, King achieved his first televised nine dart finish. It came in September 2009 at the South African Masters against James Wade, and was the first ever televised nine dart finish outside of Europe.\n2009 Premier League.\nKing made a great start to his Premier League career as he opened up with an 8–1 victory over Sky wildcard Wayne Mardle. He then went on to record three more victories on the bounce beating James Wade 8–1, John Part 8–2 and Jelle Klaasen 8–4. He then faced defending champion Phil Taylor in Newcastle, recording a 7–7 draw despite leading 7–5 with both players averaging over 100. King's form then dropped, only winning two more games in Birmingham and Glasgow against Mardle and Wade respectively. King was also a controversial figure during the tournament, often letting the crowd get to him and affect his mood and darts. During a 2009 Premier League match with Taylor, he threw a dart over Taylor as he stooped down to pick up his flight. During the post-match interview, neither of them would look at each other. His final position of 4th in the league was influenced by the illness of Mardle, as he was withdrawn from the competition. Therefore, all results that included Mardle were annulled, including King's two victories over Mardle. King's fourth place in the overall league meant that he faced Taylor in the play-off semi-finals at the Wembley Arena. King won 10–6 to end Taylor's winning streak in Premier League competitions. Despite this victory he was to finish runner-up as he lost the final 13–8 to Wade, who beat Raymond van Barneveld 10–8 in the other semi-final. Wade led King 8–2 before a mini comeback from King but Wade was able to see the game out to claim his maiden Premier League Darts title.\n2010.\nKing went into the 2010 World Championship as number 5 in the PDC Order of Merit. Despite a poor performance in the tournament, where he lost 2–4 in the second round to Co Stompé, he still qualified for the 2010 Premier League Darts King reached his third PDC major final in the 2010 Players Championship Finals. Having beaten James Wade, Jelle Klaasen, Wayne Jones and Colin Osborne in earlier rounds, he narrowly lost in the final to Paul Nicholson 13–11. This was his third PDC Premier event final without victory. King also reached the last 16 in the 2010 UK Open, losing 8–9 to Gary Anderson. King hit his second televised nine-dart finish during the match.\n2010 Premier League.\nKing started the 2010 Premier League with wins over James Wade and Adrian Lewis. His first loss of the season came in Belfast as he lost 6–8 to Ronnie Baxter. His rivalry with Phil Taylor continued in Manchester, where King recorded a 7–7 draw. King lost his last three round-robin matches to Taylor, Raymond van Barneveld and Simon Whitlock, but he still made it to the semi-finals for the second consecutive year, again finishing 4th in the table. He finished on the same number of points as Baxter, but qualified due to a better leg difference. Just like in the previous year, he played against Taylor in the semi-final. This time, Taylor resoundingly won 8–1, averaging 107.98 in the process Despite losing badly against Taylor, King beat Whitlock in the third-place play-off.\n2011.\nKing went into the 2011 World Championship ranked 6th in the PDC Order of Merit. His World Championship campaign was ended in the second round, where he was beaten 3–4 by Andy Smith. After the World Championship, King dropped out of the automatic qualifying places for the 2011 Premier League Darts, and was not awarded a wildcard. His successful streak in the Players Championship Finals continued as he again reached the semi-final for the second consecutive year. He lost in the semi-final to Phil Taylor 8–10. He lost in the third round of the 2011 UK Open tournament, losing 9–5 to Mark Walsh. He qualified for the 2011 World Matchplay Darts as the 9th seed., but lost 6–10 against Justin Pipe in the first round, reporting a complaint of tennis elbow. At the 2011 European Championship, he beat Co Stompé 6–1 in the first round, before losing 3–10 to Taylor in the second round. He also qualified for the 2011 Championship League Darts winner's group by beating Simon Whitlock 6–3 in the final of group five. In the winner's group finished second in the table before losing to Paul Nicholson in the semi-final. At the Players Championship Finals in December, he beat Colin Lloyd 6–4 to meet Phil Taylor in the second round. King produced his second victory over Taylor in major competitions with an 8–5 win. However, he lost in the quarter-finals to eventual winner Kevin Painter.\n2012.\nKing played Geoff Kime in the first round of the 2012 World Championship and outplayed his opponent, winning 3–0 without dropping a leg. However, he was knocked out in the second round for the third successive year as he was beaten 1–4 by Michael van Gerwen. At the UK Open King beat his old BDO rival Ted Hankey and Gareth Cousins, before losing 7–9 to van Gerwen in the last 32. Due to dropping out of the top 16 in the PDC rankings, King was due to play seed Phil Taylor in the first round of the 2012 World Matchplay. Despite a strong performance where he hit eight maximums to Taylor's one, King crucially missed three darts to lead the match 9–8 and instead lost 8–10.\nAt the World Grand Prix in October, King reached his first major final in two years. In his first round match against Terry Jenkins, King survived five missed match darts from his opponent to edge the game 2–1 in sets, and then saw off Dave Chisnall (3–1) and Robert Thornton (3–0 in 31 minutes) to meet home favourite Brendan Dolan in the semi-finals. King came back from 0–2 down in the first set to take it and from there was in control of the match as he won 5–2 and met Michael van Gerwen in the final. King led 3–0 and 4–1 in the final, but from there on only won three more legs as he lost the match 4–6. King afterwards admitted he was unhappy with the crowd, as they were loudly booing his starting and finishing doubles, but the £40,000 runner-up prize saw him climb to 13th in the world.\nKing won all three of his group games at the Grand Slam of Darts, but was defeated by Kevin Painter 5–10 in the last 16. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, King was 20th on the Order of Merit, comfortably inside the top 32 who qualified for the Players Championship Finals. He reached the quarter-finals, where he lost 7–10 to Justin Pipe.\n2013.\nKing lost in the first round of the PDC World Championship for the first time in its 2013 edition 2–3 to Dean Winstanley. The match has been described as a classic with both players missing darts to win before Winstanley took the deciding set 6–4. His first final of the year came at the eighth UK Open Qualifier in April, having won seven games including defeats over James Wade, Wes Newton and Robert Thornton, but he was then whitewashed 0–6 by Michael van Gerwen. He was the seventh seed for the UK Open itself. King reached the final of the Austrian Darts Open by beating Joe Cullen 6–0 in the quarter-finals with an average of 103.66 and Steve Beaton 6–5 in the semis. He faced van Gerwen once more in the final and was defeated 3–6. He also played van Gerwen in the third round of the UK Open and was defeated 5–9. King's second European Tour final of the year came in September at the German Darts Masters where he edged past Peter Wright 6–5 in the third round, whitewashed James Wade 6–0 in the quarter-finals and beat Wayne Jones 6–4 in the semis. He faced Steve Beaton and with the final on throw with Beaton 4–3 ahead King incredibly burst his score when on 134 as he hit a treble 20 with his last dart instead of a single to leave 40. Beaton replied by finishing 160 and, even though King fought back to take the match into a deciding leg, he never had a dart for the title as Beaton won 6–5. King could not replicate his performances at the World Grand Prix from last year as he was defeated 2–0 in sets by Wayne Jones in the first round.\n2014.\nKing overcame Darin Young and Ricky Evans to face Adrian Lewis in the third round of the 2014 World Championship. He lost nine of the first eleven legs and could never recover as he was beaten 4–1 in sets. King's first final of the year came in February at the Dutch Darts Masters, but he was defeated 6–4 by Michael van Gerwen whilst averaging 107.40. Despite playing with a bad sciatica in his back, King reached the semi-finals of the UK Open for the first time in his career. He fell 3–0 down to Lewis and was denied a place in the final with a 10–6 defeat. In the first round of the World Matchplay, King was 5–4 ahead of Kim Huybrechts and then won five legs in a row to advance 10–4 with an average of 101.06. He could not replicate his form in the next round however, as he averaged 89.59 in a 13–8 loss to Lewis. In September, King ended a run of three defeats in European Tour finals to win the European Darts Grand Prix by beating Michael Smith 6–5.\nIn a tight match in the quarter-finals of the World Grand Prix, King was defeated in a final leg decider against Van Gerwen as he was unable to checkout 120. He went a stage further at the European Championship, but lost 11–8 to Terry Jenkins. King continued his fine form at the Masters by beating Simon Whitlock and Justin Pipe and then produced a superb performance to exact revenge over Van Gerwen 11–9 with a 121 finish on the bull. He built on his momentum in the final against James Wade to lead 5–0 after the first session with an average of 110 and was also 9–2 in front. Wade rallied to trail 9–6 before a 158 finish from King saw him stand one leg away from his first PDC major title. However, he would miss a total of eight championship darts as Wade completed his comeback with an 11–10 win. The misses didn't seem to affect him at the Grand Slam, as he punished every mistake from Gary Anderson in a second round 10–4 win and then beat Stephen Bunting 16–9 to face Phil Taylor in the semi-finals. King couldn't keep pace with Taylor as he fell 12–2 down and, though he briefly rallied, was eliminated 16–9. Taylor also knocked King out of the Players Championship Finals, 10–7 in the second round.\n2015.\nKing suffered a surprise 3–2 defeat to German teenager Max Hopp in the first round of the 2015 World Championship. He lost 10–3 in the first round of the Masters to James Wade. King showed his best battling abilities at the UK Open to defeat Gary Anderson 9–8 after being 8–4 down and surviving 13 match darts from Anderson. He then overturned an 8–5 deficit against Nathan Derry to win 9–8 and emerged successfully from a deciding leg for the third game in a row by beating Kyle Anderson 9–8 to reach the quarter-finals. He met Stephen Bunting and the first 12 legs went on throw, before Bunting took four unanswered legs to inflict a 10–6 defeat on King. The rest of 2015 proved to be disappointing for King as he was eliminated at the first round stage of the World Matchplay, World Grand Prix, European Championship and Players Championship Finals and could not get out of his group at the Grand Slam.\n2016.\nAfter edging out Russia's Aleksandr Oreshkin 3–2 in the first round of the 2016 World Championship, King lost 4–2 to Jelle Klaasen in round two. He won through to the semi-finals of the Dutch Darts Masters, which included recovering from 5–0 down to Benito van de Pas in the quarters to win 6–5, and was beaten 6–2 by Michael van Gerwen. He lost 9–7 to Van de Pas in the third round of the UK Open. King inflicted James Wade's first ever first round defeat at the World Matchplay by beating him 10–5 and then saw off Brendan Dolan 11–8 to play in the quarter-finals of the event for the first time in seven years. In an extremely tight match he narrowly lost 16–14 to Phil Taylor, with the 16-time world champion stating that it was the best he had seen King play for two or three years. He lost in the opening round of both the World Grand Prix and Players Championship Finals and James Wilson edged out King 10–9 in the second round of the European Championship.\n2017.\nKing was on the brink of being knocked out in the first round of the 2017 World Championship as he was 2–0 down in sets to Steve West. In the third set, West was on 36 for the match, but King took out a 136 finish, won the set and levelled the match at 2–2. In the deciding set West missed two match darts and King would win 3–2 and was in tears on stage afterwards. In the second round Michael Smith missed five darts to beat King 4–1. King then hit a match saving 130 checkout to help him close to 3–3 and Smith missed three more match darts in the deciding set, but eventually got over the line to edge King out 4–3. King reached his first final since 2014 at the third Players Championship and was defeated 6–5 by Rob Cross.\n2018.\nAt the 2018 World Championship, King lost 3–2 in the first round to Zoran Lerchbacher.\n2019.\nAt the 2019 World Championship, King lost 4–2 in the third round to Brendan Dolan.\nHe reached the quarter-finals of the World Matchplay, beating defending champion Gary Anderson en route, before losing to Michael Smith.\n2020.\nAt the 2020 World Championship, King lost 4–1 in the third round to Simon Whitlock.\nIn November he reached his first major final in 6 years at the Players Championships Finals, where he eventually lost 11–10 to defending champion Michael van Gerwen.\n2021.\nAt the 2021 World Championship, King lost 4–1 in the fourth round to eventual champion Gerwyn Price.\nAt the Masters, he lost 11–8 in the final to Jonny Clayton.\n2022.\nAt the 2022 World Championship, King had his best run since 2009 by beating Ryan Joyce, Steve Lennon and Raymond Smith, but was eventually whitewashed 5–0 in the quarterfinals by James Wade.\n2023.\nAt the 2023 World Championship, King began his campaign with a 3–2 win over Danny Baggish.\nWorld Championship performances.\nKing has reached two World Championship finals and four semi-finals since making his debut in the BDO version in 1997. He went as far as the semi-final in his debut year, losing to eventual champion Les Wallace. During his run he hit thirty 180s, setting a new record for the tournament at the time. Since switching to the PDC, his best performance came in the 2009 World Championship when he reached the semi-final, losing 2–6 to Phil Taylor.\nHe reached his first BDO World Championship final in 2002. He narrowly beat Raymond van Barneveld 5–3 in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals he convincingly beat Colin Monk 5–1. He lost the final 4–6 to Tony David. King spoke on David's performance congratulating him and commented, \"I just wish I could have played half as well as he did.\"\nIn 2003, King beat Steve Coote, Dennis Harbour and Monk before losing to van Barneveld 5–2 in the semi-finals.\nIn 2004, King again reached the world final. During his run he beat Rick Hofstra 3–1, Jarkko Komula 3–2, Ritchie Davies 5–4, Tony O'Shea 5–1, before meeting Andy Fordham in the final. The match ended in a 6–3 victory for Fordham, making it the second time in three years that King had finished runner-up. Again King told of his disappointment commenting \"I don't think it was a fantastic game. I just did not turn up\".\nHis last appearance at the BDO World Championship was in 2007, where he narrowly lost a semi-final to Martin Adams 5–6.\nKing's most successful PDC World Championship was in the 2009, when he beat Mark Walsh and Dennis Smith before beating Barrie Bates 5–2 in the quarter-finals. This run set up a semi-final clash with Phil Taylor. King lost to Taylor 2–6. However, since then he has been knocked out in the second round every year to Co Stompé, Andy Smith and Michael van Gerwen in 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively.\nControversy.\nKing has been the subject of controversy during his career. In 2003 following his semi-final defeat to Raymond van Barneveld, he subsequently blamed the air conditioning being on. The following year in his first round match against Rick Hofstra, when tied at 1–1 in sets, King complained that the length of the oche was not right; the players were forced to leave the stage whilst officials measured, King was incorrect. The players returned with the majority of the crowd against King, though he went on to win the match 3–1.\nIn the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts, King played then-BDO player John Henderson in his last group game. Despite winning the game 5–4, he exchanged heated words with Henderson towards the end of the match and was visibly unhappy. Whilst refusing to reveal the precise reason to his actions, it was understood through television analysis that King felt Henderson, after having to move across the oche for a better shot with his third dart, had stepped across the oche line and thrown from a closer distance to the board, thus believing he had gained an unfair advantage.\nPersonal life.\nKing's father died in September 2010, which King later admitted left him 'devastated', and this led to a loss of form. At the 2011 PDC World Darts Championship, King's wife cheered him on accompanied by a crown in remembrance of his father.\nKing is good friends with and lives close to fellow darts player Peter Wright and they often practise together. He lives in Bradwell in Norfolk. He is also a keen motor enthusiast and revealed that when younger he gave up his chance of becoming a racing driver to continue his fledgling darts career. King currently travels and practises with upcoming darts player and 2012 World Youth Champion James Hubbard, whom King has described as a player to watch in the future.\nDuring the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom in 2020, King undertook work as a delivery driver for online retail company Amazon, and in 2021 set up a construction company.\nCareer statistics.\n(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Prel.)

The captain of the team is Parramatta Eels' hooker, Isaac de Gois and their coach is Mal Speers.\nHistory.\n2000s.\nThe Portuguese Rugby League Association (PRLA) was established in January 2005. Based in Marrickville, Sydney, Australia, the founder of the PRLA is an Australian born rugby league supporter, who married into a Portuguese family.\nThe first meeting of the PRLA was held at the Henson Park Hotel on early September 2005 and was attended by players who would form the nucleus of the team for the first match.\nPortugal's first match was played against Fiji A, one month later, at Granville Park, on 8 October 2005, as part of the Fiji National Day Celebrations.\nThe team was captained by Isaac de Gois, featuring his brothers Eric and Aaron, as well as their cousin, Fábio de Gois. Born in Madeira, Fábio was playing his first match of rugby league.\nIvan Pacho has the honour of scoring Portugal's first try, in a 40–4 loss.\nIn 2006, the PRLA entered the team in two sevens tournaments (VB Sevens @ St Marys and the Illawarra Sevens in Wollongong) as well as accepting an offer to play against touring teams from Britain (Great Britain Armed Forces and the British Royal Armoured Corps). \nIn 2007, Portugal's featured in the VB Sevens at St Marys in February and in October, an International friendly against Malta.\nIn April 2007, PRLA Executive met with the officials from the Portuguese Rugby Union, who were in Australia for the IRB World Sevens Rugby Tournament.

        "title": "American Association of Professional Baseball",
        "text": "The American Association of Professional Baseball is an independent professional baseball league founded in 2005. It operates in the central United States and Canada, mostly in cities not served by Major League Baseball teams or their minor league affiliates. Joshua Schaub is the league commissioner. League offices are located in Moorhead, Minnesota. Though a separate entity, the league shared a commissioner and director of umpires with the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball during that league's existence. The American Association of Professional Baseball has 501(c)(6) tax-exempt status with the Internal Revenue Service. In 2020, as part of MLB's reorganization of the minor leagues, the American Association, together with the Atlantic League and the Frontier League, became an official MLB Partner League.\nHistory.\nThe American Association was founded in October 2005 when the St. Paul Saints, Lincoln Saltdogs, Sioux City Explorers, and Sioux Falls Canaries announced they were leaving the Northern League. Around the same time, the Central Baseball League announced it was disbanding after four seasons. The Fort Worth Cats, Shreveport-Bossier Sports, Pensacola Pelicans, Coastal Bend Aviators, and El Paso Diablos joined the four former Northern League teams and the expansion St. Joe Blacksnakes to form the American Association as a ten-team league. The new league began play in 2006, with a 96-game schedule, which has since expanded to 100 games.\n2008 saw the league lose the Blacksnakes and Aviators, with the Grand Prairie AirHogs and Wichita Wingnuts joining in their place. In 2011 and 2012 the league went through a significant shift. Fort Worth was kicked out of the AA and moved to the North American League, while Shreveport and Pensacola both relocated. The Pelicans moved to Amarillo, Texas, and became the Amarillo Sox (later the Amarillo Thunderheads) while Shreveport, who had changed their name to the Shreveport-Bossier Captains, moved to Laredo, Texas and became the Laredo Lemurs. In addition, four more Northern League franchises (Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks, Gary SouthShore RailCats, Kansas City T-Bones, and Winnipeg Goldeyes) joined the American Association as that league's stability came into question.\nFor the 2012 season, the American Association began interleague play with the Can-Am League. The two leagues were both headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, and both had Miles Wolff as their commissioner. This was similar to interleague play in Major League Baseball, but American Association and Can-Am League were separate legal entities and had separate playoffs/championships.\nAt the end of the 2013 season, due to the Tucson Padres relocating to their city, the El Paso Diablos suspended operations. The team was eventually revived and relocated, operating as the Joplin Blasters. The Blasters ceased operations after the conclusion of the 2016 season.\nOn November 19, 2015, Miles Wolff announced that there would no longer be interleague play. It also was announced that for the Amarillo Thunderheads and Grand Prairie AirHogs would operate as a joint team, the Texas AirHogs, playing 25 games in Amarillo and 25 games in Grand Prairie to make up a 12-team league. The team remained in Grand Prairie full-time in 2017, with the Cleburne Railroaders joining the league the same season. Shortly before the 2017 season, the Laredo Lemurs withdrew from the league. They were temporarily replaced by the Salina Stockade from the Pecos League for the season. The Chicago Dogs joined for 2018 and the Milwaukee Milkmen joined in 2019, replacing the Wichita Wingnuts, who folded in large part due to the demolition of Lawrence-Dumont Stadium and their eventual replacement by the Wichita Wind Surge.\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league announced that 6 of its 12 clubs would play an abbreviated 60-game season beginning on July 3, 2020. Five stadiums were used for gameplay: Sioux Falls Stadium (hosting the Sioux Falls Canaries and St. Paul Saints during July), Newman Outdoor Field (hosting the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks and Winnipeg Goldeyes), Franklin Field (hosting the Milwaukee Milkmen), Impact Field (hosting the Chicago Dogs), and CHS Field (hosting the St. Paul Saints beginning in August). Players from non-participating teams had the opportunity to be drafted by one of the six active clubs. A limited number of fans were allowed to attend games, in accordance with local government guidelines and restrictions. \nThe 2021 season saw the league lose both the Texas AirHogs, who dropped out of the league, and the St. Paul Saints who moved to affiliated ball as the Triple-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. Joining the league in 2021 were the Kane County Cougars, who were dropped from affiliated ball during the 2021 minor league reorganization, as well as the Houston Apollos, who were a traveling team for the 2021 campaign. \nIn May 2021, the league announced the approval of Lake Country Baseball, based in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, as a new member of the league starting in 2022. Construction commenced later that summer on a new stadium and multi-use indoor sports facility, which opened for play on May 20, 2022 as Wisconsin Brewing Company Park. The team selected the name Lake Country DockHounds, after hosting an online name the team contest. \nWith the DockHounds joining the league for the 2022 season, the American Association opted for realignment of the divisions. Going away from the prior North/South divisions, the league decided to go with East/West divisions. The league placed Cleburne, Chicago, Kane County, Gary SouthShore, Milwaukee, and Lake Country in the East Division; and Winnipeg, Fargo-Moorhead, Sioux Falls, Sioux City, Lincoln, and Kansas City in the West Division. The league also changed the playoff format taking the top four teams in each division into the playoffs, and allowing the team in each division with the best record to choose their first round opponent from the remaining three division teams.\nBusiness model.\nThe American Association (AA) typically recruits college and former major and minor league players. Former affiliated-league players who get injured or have other circumstances join the AA as an opportunity to get re-signed by major league organizations. For example, David Peralta was signed in 2004 as a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals but suffered injuries and was released in 2009. He resurrected his career as an outfielder with teams such as the AA's Wichita Wingnuts and Amarillo Sox in 2012 and 2013, then became a starting outfielder for the Arizona Diamondbacks. \nOther players include college players who were not drafted into MLB but seek the opportunity to be seen by major league scouts and possibly get signed by major league organizations. Other former MLB players join the AA as a way to stay involved in baseball after their MLB career, often as coaches and managers.\nAs of 2008, the salary cap for each team was $100,000, with a minimum salary of $800 per month. The price of an expansion team is also about $750,000. This is in stark contrast with the minor and major leagues. Former Commissioner Miles Wolff stated in an interview that \"We have to pay the salaries of the players, which they don't in an affiliated [league]. It's a much riskier business. Just because of the longevity and tradition, we usually don't get the best cities, either, so some of the markets we're in are not great markets. But as I say, I think it's a better product.\"\nIn 2018, the league raised the minimum salary to $1,200 per month to comply with the new Save America's Pastime Act.\nRoster rules.\nRosters are limited to 25 players, with a maximum of six may be veterans and minimum of five must be rookies or LS-1. The remaining players will be designated limited service players and of those LS players only six (6) may be LS-4. Two of the LS-4 players may have LS-5 status.\nRookie: A player with less than one year of service.\nLS-1: A player with fewer than two years of service.\nLS-2: A player with fewer than three years of service.\nLS-3: A player with fewer than four years of service.\nLS-4: A player with fewer than five years of service.\nLS-5: A player with less than 6 years of service.\nVeteran: A player with six or more years of service. If a player has six or more years of service but has not reached the age of 26 by September 1 of that season, he will be considered an LS-4. If he has not reached the age of 24 by September 1 of that season, he will be considered an LS-3.\nTeams.\nLeague timeline.\n \nAll-Star Game.\nThe American Association hosted an annual All-Star Game from 2006 to 2010. The league's first All-Star game was played in El Paso, Texas, on July 18, 2006, which pit a team of American Association All-Stars against an All-Star team from the Can-Am League. Its current format pits the all-stars from each division against each other. There was no All-Star game in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2018, 2020, or 2021. \nLeague attendance.\nAttendance Records.\nSeason: 413,482, St. Paul, 2016\nGame: 13,406, El Paso, July 4, 2011"

The Jungle Trail is the oldest, followed by the Dragon Trail and the Kupu Kupu and Expedition trails. The luge is a self-driving car system in which riders control the speed by pushing a pair of handlebars back and forth. The luge ride goes downhill, relying on gravitational pull to move. After the ride, the 315 meter long Skyride, using chairlifts, brings riders, luge carts, and the helmets back to the starting point. The Skyride is similar to a ski lift.

        "title": "Fantasy basketball",
        "text": "Fantasy basketball is a game in which the participants serve as owners and general managers of virtual professional basketball teams. The competitors select their rosters by participating in a draft in which all relevant National Basketball Association (NBA) players are available. Fantasy points are awarded in weekly matchups based on the actual performances of basketball players in real-world competition. The game typically involves the NBA, but can also involve other leagues, such as the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) or NCAA.\nHistory.\nIn the decades following the success of early fantasy leagues, such as Rotisserie League Baseball, the concept of applying the fantasy format to sports other than baseball and American football grew in popularity. This trend was due in large part to increased capabilities to easily compute and access sports statistics via the Internet.\nIn 2014, the NBA invested in daily fantasy sports company FanDuel. At the time, the legality of daily fantasy sports was not widely recognized. However, following the 2018 United States Supreme Court decision in \"Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association\", which allowed states to legalize sports betting, questions surrounding the legality of daily fantasy sports, as well as fantasy sports in general, within the United States have largely been settled. As of August 2022, FanDuel operates daily fantasy contests, including basketball competitions, in 44 US states. In the 2021/2022 NBA Fantasy season, Henry Murray would go on to win the first inaugural ring. To this day, those within the Tingus Pingus Fantasy league continue to respect this immense achievement.\nLeague types.\nA fantasy basketball league may be organized in a variety of ways. In rotisserie leagues, the scoring system is based on a series of preset statistical categories (such as points, rebounds, and assists, etc.) in the same format as Rotisserie League Baseball. Each team is ranked in each category at the end of the season. Points are then awarded based on these rankings. For example, in an eight-team league, the team that collectively blocks the most shots might earn eight points, the team that blocks the second most might earn seven, and so on. The number of statistics for which the teams are ranked may vary. Another common format is head-to-head competition, in which each team only competes against one other team in a given week. At the end of the week, the winner of each matchup may be determined in a variety of ways. In addition to scoring variations, league organization may also differ based on the structure of each team's roster.\nCategories.\nFantasy basketball leagues may use a variety of statistical categories to evaluate teams. Both rotisserie and head-to-head leagues use categories, either to rank all teams against one another at the end of a season or to determine the winners of weekly matchups between pairs of teams. For example, Yahoo! Sports hosts fantasy competitions with eight or nine categories. The following are the nine default categories used by Yahoo! Sports.\nIn a rotisserie league, following the end-of-season ranking in all categories, the team with the most points wins the league. In some leagues, the number of points awarded in each statistical category may be adjusted, rather than all of them being worth the same number of points.\nRotisserie (ROTO).\nIn rotisserie scoring, the real-life statistics accumulated by the players on a team are aggregated and ranked against the same statistics for the other teams in the league. Fantasy points are earned based on these rankings. For example, in a twelve-team league, the team with the most rebounds over the course of the season to date would be awarded twelve fantasy points. The team with the next-highest number of rebounds would be awarded eleven fantasy points, and so on, with the team with the fewest rebounds being awarded a single fantasy point. For negative categories like fouls or turnovers, the team with the fewest statistics is awarded the most fantasy points. This is done for all categories counted by the particular league. The team with the highest number of fantasy points at the end of the season is the winner.\nRotisserie scoring encourages balance on the team's roster. Winning the rebounds category by one rebound or by one thousand rebounds counts the same, while winning the steals category by one steal and the assists category by one assist is worth \"twice\" as many points as winning the single rebounding category by one thousand rebounds. Successful teams must fare well in several categories to win in rotisserie leagues. Some teams may elect to \"punt\" one or several categories by being intentionally poor in that category to optimize their roster for the other categories.\nHead-to-head (H2H).\nIn head-to-head scoring, teams compete against a single other team over the course of a week. During that week, the real-life statistics of the players on each team are accumulated, and at the end of the week the team with the most points over the week wins.\nThere are three styles of head-to-head scoring:\nDaily fantasy basketball.\nLike traditional fantasy basketball, in daily fantasy basketball, players draft a team of NBA players who then score fantasy points according to set scoring rules. However, instead of each competitor having the same team for an entire season, daily fantasy sports contests last just one day. Many sites offer data and strategies to build lineups; some of these sites are free, while others charge a fee. Some other daily basketball contests incorporate a few of the traditional settings combined with daily fantasy basketball settings to create a new experience for users.\nDraft.\nBefore each season, fantasy basketball leagues hold a draft in which each team drafts NBA players. These players are kept on the roster of the team that drafted them unless they are traded for other players or are dropped, whereby they enter a pool of unowned players that any team may claim. The order of draft picks may be determined randomly or by the league standings from the previous year, in which the team with the worst record picks first, followed by the team with the second-worst record, etc. In some cases, owners retain the same draft position in each round. In contrast, in a traditional \"serpentine\" or \"snake\" draft, owners draft players in a \"snake\" method, in which the owner who picks first in the odd rounds picks last in the even rounds, the owner who picks second in the odd rounds picks second to last in the even rounds, etc. in the interest of fairness.\nIn an auction draft, each owner has an imaginary budget which must be used to purchase players in an auction format. Owners take turns nominating players for open bid, and the owner who bids the highest on each player receives that player, reducing his or her remaining budget accordingly. One proposed advantage of auction drafts is their ability to offer every owner equal access to every player, whereas in a traditional format, a certain owner's desired player may be selected by another team before the owner's next turn to pick.\nDrafts can be conducted in \"live\" or \"auto\" formats. Live drafts involve team owners selecting players in real time, while auto drafts are those in which selections are made automatically by computer based on pre-draft rankings set by each owner. Often, owners who are not present at the chosen time of the draft will \"auto-draft\" while the rest of the league makes their selections live.\nWhether live or auto, the vast majority of fantasy drafts take place online, but some leagues hold in-person drafts in which selections are made on computers or physical draft boards.\nRegardless of the format in which a draft is held, each team owner may employ a variety of strategies when making his or her selections. In order to select the best possible players, owners must evaluate the talent and forecast the performance of each player for the upcoming season. A variety of resources may be used to this effect, including rankings released by fantasy basketball journalists and websites.\nTeam rosters.\nFor a standard 12-team league, the manager will usually draft 13 players. The roster considers to draft the following: \nSome leagues include an IR (Injury Reserve) roster spot pushing the count of the roster to 14. The IR is an extra spot on the roster that is used for players who suffer a prolonged injury or are out indefinitely.\nSome leagues also have a limit on the number of positions you can draft. For example; ESPN allows only a maximum of 4 centers on a roster. This is to prevent a manager from drafting a majority of centers, leaving no centers for other managers.\nKeeper/Dynasty leagues.\nIn a keeper/dynasty league, the season does not finish at the end of the year. A manager's team is carried over in the following season and players can be kept between seasons. A commissioner can decide:\nRankings for keeper/dynasty leagues differ from regular season-by-season rankings, and factor in a player's age, future development potential, and long-term status with their team. Also considered are their initial fantasy draft position or auction value as players can often be kept the following year as the selection in the same draft position or for the same auction price.\nWaiver wire.\nWaiver wire is specifically used for player transactions. The waiver wire consists of a list of available players that were not drafted and/or players that were dropped from a manager's roster. Managers can also drop a player(s), which inserts the dropped player into the waiver wire. Waiver wire is accessible to all players in a league. Waiver wire may have restrictions / specific rules depending on commissioner's preferred settings.\nCommissioners can set a bidding system when picking the un-drafted players as more than 1 person will want this specific player, where the winning bid will get the desired player.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association (FSGA), of the 59.3 million people who played fantasy sports in the US and Canada in 2017, 43.2 million were American adults. In 2019, 45.9 million American adults participated. The FSGA estimated that 19% of American adults played fantasy sports in 2019, compared to 13% in 2014. Around 19% of fantasy players play fantasy basketball, making it the third most popular fantasy sport behind fantasy football (78% of fantasy players) and fantasy baseball (39%). A 2019 FSGA survey found that 81% of fantasy sports players were male, 50% were between the ages of 18 and 34 (with an average age of 37.7), 67% were employed full-time, and 47% made more than $75,000 per year. A 2015 analysis found that 89.8% were white and 51.5% were unmarried."

        "title": "Drew Pearson (American football)",
        "text": "Drew Pearson (born January 12, 1951) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football for the Tulsa Golden Hurricane. He was elected for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021.\nEarly years.\nPearson was born and raised in South River, New Jersey, and began his football career at South River High School as one of the wide receivers of Joe Theismann. As a junior, he succeeded Theismann as the starting quarterback. He also lettered in baseball and basketball, graduating in 1969.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from the University of Tulsa. As a sophomore in 1970, he was the backup quarterback behind John Dobbs. He started four games, making 36 out of 86 completions (41.9%), for 423 passing yards, one touchdown and 5 interceptions.\nAs a junior in 1971, he was converted into a wide receiver. He was second on the team with 22 receptions for 429 yards. He led the team with an average of 19.5 yards per reception and 3 receiving touchdowns.\nAs a senior in 1972, he led a run-oriented offense with 33 receptions for 690 yards (20.9 yards per reception) and 5 touchdowns. He finished his college career with 55 receptions for 1,119 yards, 8 touchdowns and a 20.3-yard average per reception.\nIn 1985, he was inducted into the Tulsa Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1998, he received the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award.\nProfessional career.\nIn 1973, he was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys and made the team as a third-team wide receiver because of his special teams play. As a rookie, he replaced Otto Stowe after Stowe suffered a broken ankle in the seventh game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles, and his backup Mike Montgomery would also fall to injury in the next game. He appeared in 14 games with 6 starts, making 22 receptions for 388 yards and 2 touchdowns.\nIn 1974, Stowe asked to be traded and Pearson became the full-time starter opposite Golden Richards. He led the team with 62 receptions and 1,087 yards, while also catching 2 touchdowns. He would keep leading the team in receiving until 1978, when Tony Hill took over the number one role at wide receiver.\nIn 1979, he and Tony Hill—along with Tony Dorsett—helped the Cowboys become the first team in NFL history to have two 1,000-yards wide receivers and a 1,000-yard running back, when he recorded 55 receptions, 1,026 yards and 8 touchdowns. Pearson and Hill also became the first wide receiver tandem in Cowboys history to record 1,000-yard receiving seasons in the same year.\nIn 1980, he surpassed Bob Hayes' club mark in receptions and was selected by the Cowboys as their nominee for NFL Man of the Year. In the 1981 NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers, Pearson almost rendered \"The Catch\" irrelevant when, in the waning moments of the game, he caught a long pass from Danny White that would've gone for a touchdown and won the game for the Cowboys had 49ers cornerback Eric Wright not made a one-handed horse-collar tackle, stopping him just outside field-goal range (White fumbled on the next play, thus preserving victory for the 49ers and putting them in Super Bowl XVI).\nIn 1982, he delivered a key downfield block during Tony Dorsett's NFL record 99-yard touchdown run.\nIn 1983, he passed Hayes as the franchise leader in receiving yards.\nOn March 22, 1984, at 1:30 a.m. Drew fell asleep while driving, and crashed his car against a parked tractor-trailer. Drew's brother Carey was killed; Drew himself sustained a career-ending liver injury in the crash.\nPearson helped the Cowboys to three Super Bowl appearances and a victory in Super Bowl XII in 1978. He also scored a touchdown in Super Bowl X. Pearson was known as \"Mr. Clutch\" for his numerous clutch catches in game-winning situations, especially the Hail Mary reception from Roger Staubach that sealed the victory over the Vikings in a , one of the most infamous plays in NFL history. He also caught the game-sealing touchdown in a against the Los Angeles Rams and the game-winning touchdown pass from reserve quarterback Clint Longley in the 1974 Thanksgiving game against the Washington Redskins. All three plays were named among the Top 75 plays in NFL history by NFL Films in 1994. Pearson figured prominently in a fourth play on that list, throwing the final block to clear Tony Dorsett's path to the end zone on his 99-yard touchdown run in 1983. In addition in the 1980 playoff game at Atlanta, Pearson's clutch receptions helped win that game in a comeback by the Cowboys.\nHe rose to become one of the NFL's greatest wide receivers, earning career records of 489 receptions and 7,822 receiving yards, along with 189 rushing yards, 155 yards returning kickoffs, and 50 touchdowns (48 receiving and two fumble recoveries). Pearson was named one of the Top 20 Pro Football All-Time wide receivers, he was also recognized for his achievements by being named to the NFL 1970s All-Decade Team. Despite this fact, he was the only player from the team to not be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame at the time, including the only one from the offensive first team category.\nPearson was named All-Pro three times (1974, 1976–77) All-NFC in 1975 and second Team All-NFC in 1978. In addition, Pearson was a Pro Bowler in 1974, 1976 and 1977. He was named The Football Digest NFL receiver of the year in 1977. He led the National Football Conference (NFC) in pass receptions in 1976 with 58. He served as offensive captain for the Cowboys in 1977, 1978, 1982 and 1983.\nIn 1984, he was named to the Dallas Cowboys' 25th-anniversary team.\nIn 2009, on the NFL Network show \"NFL's Top 10\", in the episode titled \"Greatest Dallas Cowboys\", he is number 10 on the list, although the update in 2016 where Drew was not on the list and was replaced by Randy White as #10 as well.\nOn August 19, 2011, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones announced that Pearson had been selected for inclusion into the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor. Pearson, Charles Haley and Larry Allen were inducted during the half-time show of the Cowboys-Seahawks game on November 6, 2011.\nThe Professional Football Researchers Association named Pearson to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2010.\nPearson was named as a senior finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the Class of 2020 as a part of its \"Centennial Slate\" of 20 senior finalists. However, he fell just shy of getting inducted. The following year, he was named the lone senior finalist for the class of 2021.\nOn February 6, 2021, Pearson was named to the 2021 Pro Football Hall of Fame class and his bust was sculpted by Scott Myers.\nAfter the NFL.\nOn April 28, 2017, Pearson was selected to announce a pick at the 2017 NFL draft, which took place at Philadelphia. Amidst boos from the Eagles fans in attendance, he announced Chidobe Awuzie as the 60th pick for the Cowboys.\nPersonal life.\nPearson is married to Marsha, a daughter of Harlem Globetrotters star Marques Haynes."

        "title": "Jeff Newman (baseball)",
        "text": "Jeffrey Lynn Newman (born September 11, 1948) is an American former Major League Baseball catcher. Newman was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 26th round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft. He made his MLB debut in 1976. He was an All Star in 1979. He served as the interim manager of the Oakland Athletics in .\nEarly and personal life.\nNewman was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and is Jewish. He attended Paschal High School, where he played baseball and basketball. He later lived in Danville, California.\nNewman is a convert to Judaism, having in 1970 converted in an Orthodox ceremony. His son, Ryan, was an infielder for three years in the Pittsburgh Pirates' organization before becoming a coach for the 2005 Gulf Coast League Pirates.\nCollege.\nNewman was a History major at Texas Christian University, where he earned a B.S. in Education and also earned All-America honors as a third baseman in . In his sophomore year after batting .350 he was All-Southwest Conference First Team and All NCAA All-District First Team as well as NCAA All American Third Team, and in 1969 as a junior he batted .345, set university records in RBIs (44) and hits (57), and was All-Conference and All-District First Team.\nMinor leagues.\nNewman was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 26th round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft. Originally, Newman played first, third and the outfield. He played for the GCL Indians of the Gulf Coast League in 1970 (batting .313, leading the league in RBIs with 55, and tying for the league lead in home runs with six, while playing primarily first base), for the Reno Silver Sox of the California League in 1971 (hitting 16 home runs in 234 at bats, while playing primarily outfield) and 1972 (hitting 20 home runs and 84 RBIs), and for the San Antonio Brewers of the Texas League in 1972. In 1974 he played for the Oklahoma City 89ers of the American Association and the Salt Lake City Angels of the Pacific Coast League (batting .303), in 1975 he played for Salt Lake City and for the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League, and in 1975 he again played for Toledo.\nHe didn't begin catching until with the Reno Silver Sox. He spent six seasons in the Indians' farm system, batting .259 with 73 home runs and 333 runs batted in when the Oakland A's purchased his contract in October .\nMajor leagues.\nOakland Athletics.\nNewman was called up to the majors in June , when he was 27 years old, and spent the rest of the season backing up Gene Tenace behind the plate. He backed up Manny Sanguillén in , a season in which he threw out 51.8% of attempted base-stealers, third-best of all catchers in the American League. He then moved into a platoon with Jim Essian from through , while also backing up Dave Revering at first base.\nHe was batting .229 with 16 home runs and 52 RBIs when he was selected by AL manager Bob Lemon as Oakland's sole representative at the 1979 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. For the season, he hit 22 home runs and drove in 71 runs, both career highs. He also threw out 46.8% of attempted base-stealers, fourth-best of all catchers in the American League.\nNewman was involved in the first of two bench-clearing brawls with Lenny Randle and the Seattle Mariners on April 19, . The A's won the first half of the strike shortened season with a 37–23 record to return to the postseason for the first time since . In 1981 he also threw out 46.4% of attempted base-stealers, fifth-best of all catchers in the American League. In his only career trip to the postseason, Newman went hitless in nine plate appearances in the American League West division series and ALCS.\nAt the start of the December Winter Meetings, the A's sent Newman and outfielder Tony Armas to the Boston Red Sox for Carney Lansford, Garry Hancock, and minor leaguer Jerry King.\nBoston Red Sox.\nWhen the Red Sox originally acquired Newman in 1982, it was with the intent that he would be the back-up to Rich Gedman behind the plate. However, he soon fell to third in the depth chart behind Gary Allenson. He was released during spring training in April .\nCareer stats.\nNewman had perhaps his greatest hitting success against Wayne Garland, against whom he was 13–18 (.722) with two home runs, six doubles and a walk. He made his only appearance on the mound on September 14, 1977. He pitched one scoreless inning, though he hit the first batter he faced (Hal McRae) with a pitch.\nCoaching and managerial career.\nAs soon as his playing days ended, Newman returned to the Oakland A's as manager Jackie Moore's bullpen coach. When Moore was fired as A's manager on June 28, , Newman was named interim manager prior to the hiring of Tony La Russa. The A's went 2–8 under Newman. Through 2018, he was one of eight Jewish managers in MLB history. The others were Gabe Kapler, Bob Melvin, Brad Ausmus, Norm Sherry, Harold “Lefty” Phillips, Lou Boudreau, and Lipman Pike.

        "title": "George Mullin (baseball)",
        "text": "George Joseph Mullin (July 4, 1880 – January 7, 1944), sometimes known by the nickname \"Wabash George\", was an American right-handed baseball pitcher.\nMullin played in Major League Baseball for 14 seasons with the Detroit Tigers from 1902 to 1913, Washington Senators in 1913, and the Indianapolis Hoosiers/Newark Pepper of the Federal League from 1914 to 1915. He compiled a career record of 228–196 with a 2.82 earned run average (ERA) and 1,482 strikeouts. His 1,244 career assists ranks seventh among major league pitchers. Mullin was also a strong hitter, twice batting over .300 for a season and compiling a career batting average of .262.\nIn 12 seasons with Detroit, he helped the team win three consecutive American League pennants from 1907 to 1909. He had five 20-win seasons for the Tigers, led the American League with 29 wins in 1909, and ranks second in Detroit Tigers history with 209 wins. He also holds the Detroit Tigers' all-time club records with 3,394 innings pitched and 336 complete games and pitched the first no-hitter in Tigers' history on July 4, 1912.\nEarly years.\nMullin was born in 1880 in Toledo, Ohio, the son of Irish immigrants. He attended St. John's Jesuit High School in Toledo. From 1898 to 1901, he played semipro baseball in Wabash, Indiana, and South Bend, Indiana.\nProfessional baseball.\nFort Wayne.\nMullin began playing professional baseball in 1901 with the Fort Wayne Railroaders of the Western Association. During the 1901 season, he appeared in 47 games and compiled a 21–20 record with a 3.48 ERA over 367 innings.\nDetroit Tigers.\nMautner controversy.\nMullin's career with the Detroit Tigers began with controversy. Mullin signed to play for the Tigers late in the 1901 season. He subsequently signed a contract with Ned Hanlon's Brooklyn Superbas as well as having signed to play for the Fort Wayne club in 1902. The owner of the Fort Wayne club, Isadore Mautner, sought to have Mullin charged criminally with taking money under false pretenses and perjury. Mautner sent detectives to have Mullin arrested when the Tigers visited Chicago in April, but Mautner's plan was frustrated when Detroit officials moved Mullin (in disguise) out of the team hotel. In May, Mautner sought Mullin's extradition to Indiana, but the Governor of Indiana refused to sign the papers, concluding that the dispute was civil rather than criminal in nature. In July, Mullin was removed by police when the Tigers' train stopped in Fort Wayne on returning from St. Louis. A judge promptly released Mullin, holding that Mautner's remedy was a civil action for damages. Mullin quickly left town before Mautner could have a new warrant finalized.\nMautner later persuaded a grand jury to bring criminal charges against Mullin, and the saga continued to capture headlines well into 1903. In the end, the dispute was resolved in late 1903 with a payment of $1,000 to Mautner.\n1902–1906.\nIn his first season in Detroit, Mullin immediately showed his ability as a workhorse and as a batsman, but struggled with his pitch control and overall effectiveness. He appeared in 35 games for the 1902 Tigers, 30 of them as a starter and 25 of them complete games. He compiled a 13–16 record with a 3.67 ERA (slightly higher than the league average of 3.57). He also led the American League with 13 wild pitches and ranked fourth with 95 batters walked. At the plate, he compiled an impressive .325 batting average and .367 on-base percentage with four doubles, three triples, and 11 RBIs.\nOne of the most impressive outings of Mullin's rookie year came on July 31, 1902, when he held Washington to only two hits and managed three hits and two runs in his own plate appearances. Two weeks later, on August 18, Mullin faced Boston's star pitcher Cy Young. The game ended in a 4–4 tie when the game was called due to darkness after 11 innings. Three of Boston's runs were scored on errors by Detroit's fielders. Mullin and Young met as starting pitchers 10 times over the next seven years; Mullin won six of those games to four for Young.\nIn 1903, Mullin improved markedly, reducing his ERA by almost a point-and-a-half to 2.25 (71 points below the league average of 2.96). He appeared in 41 games, threw 31 complete games, and compiled a 19–15 record. He ranked among the American League's leading pitchers with six shutouts (second), 41 games (second), 170 strikeouts (fifth), innings pitched (fifth), and a 2.25 ERA (sixth). He also demonstrated athleticism on defense, leading the league's pitchers with 38 putouts and 108 assists. On the other hand, he continued to struggle with control as he led the league with 106 batters walked – the first of four consecutive years in which Mullin led the league in walks. On September 19, 1903, Mullin hit his first major league home run, described by the \"Detroit Free Press\" as a \"mighty clout\" that \"lifted the ball over center field fence into Twenty-ninth street.\"\nIn 1904, Mullin had another strong year, pitching a club record 42 complete games with a 2.40 ERA (below the league average of 2.60). He again ranked among the league's leading pitchers with 42 complete games (second), 163 assists (second), seven shutouts (third), innings pitched (fourth), 28 putouts (fourth), and 161 strikeouts (sixth). He also hit for a .290 batting average with a career-high 10 doubles. Despite Mullin's workhorse ability and impressive ERA, he ranked second in the league with 23 losses and led the league with 131 walks allowed 13 fielding errors. The 1904 Tigers team (one year before the arrival of Ty Cobb) was a weak-hitting group that compiled a .231 team batting average (nearly 60 points lower than Mullin) and finished in seventh place.\nThe 1905 season was Mullin's most durable. He pitched innings, a figure that remains a Detroit Tigers club record. He compiled a 21–21 record and ranked among the league leaders with 1,428 batters faced (first), innings pitched (first), 138 walks allowed (first), 41 games started (tied for first), 35 complete games (tied for first), 134 assists (second), 21 losses (third), 21 wins (fifth), and 168 strikeouts (sixth). His 2.51 ERA was slightly below the league average of 2.65.\nIn 1906, Mullin had his second consecutive 20-win season, compiling a 21–18 record in 40 starts. However, his ERA rose to 2.78, slightly higher than the league average of 2.69. And control issues persisted as he led the league in walks allowed for the fourth consecutive years.\n1907–1909.\nIn 1907, the Detroit club hired Hughie Jennings as its manager, and with the bats of Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford, the team finally had a winning combination, as they won three straight American League pennants from 1907 to 1909. During the Tigers' pennant years, Mullin remained the pitching staff's workhorse, appearing in 125 games and compiling a 66–41 record with a 2.63 ERA.\nMullin's best season was 1909, when he started the season with a one-hitter on Opening Day and then recorded eleven consecutive wins. He did not lose a game until June 15, 1909, and went on to lead the American League in both wins (29) and win percentage (.784). His 11–0 start remained a Tigers record for 104 years, until it was surpassed in 2013 by Max Scherzer's 12–0 start.\nIn World Series play from 1907 to 1909, Mullin completed all six games he started and gave up only 12 earned runs in 58 innings, for a 1.86 ERA in World Series play. Despite strong pitching from Mullin, the Tigers lost each of the World Series from 1907 to 1909. Mullin had a 2.12 ERA in the 1907 World Series, but the Detroit bats went cold, and Mullin lost both games he started. In the 1908 World Series, Mullin pitched a complete-game shutout for a win. And in the 1909 World Series, Mullin appeared in four games and compiled a 2–1 record with a 2.25 ERA. In Game 4, he pitched a five-hit, 10-strikeout complete game against Honus Wagner's Pittsburgh Pirates. Mullin's 32 innings pitched in the 1909 World Series remains a World Series record.\nIn November 1909, a group of Detroit Tigers players toured Cuba and played 12 exhibition games against two integrated Cuban teams, Habana and Almendares. Mullin was among the Tigers players who toured Cuba. The tour drew wide attention in Cuba, where baseball was already very popular. Demonstrating the high level of play in Cuba, the Tigers lost 8 of the 12 games to the integrated Cuban baseball teams. On November 27, 1909, Mullin shut out the Cuban Almendares team in a 4–0 victory for the touring Tigers.\n1910–1912.\nMullin continued as a winner and a workhorse in 1910 and 1911, with records of 21–12 and 18–10.\nOn April 20, 1912, with a crowd of 26,000 in attendance, Mullin was given the honor of pitching the first game at the new Navin Field, beating the Indians 6–5 in 11 innings. Mullin won his own game with an RBI single.\nOn May 21, 1912, Mullin shut out the Washington Senators, earning his 200th career win — a 2–0 pitching duel with Walter Johnson.\nAnd on July 4, 1912 (Mullin's 32nd birthday), he pitched the first no-hitter in Detroit Tigers history, as Mullin helped himself with 3 hits and 2 RBIs in the game.\nDetroit, Washington, and Montreal (1913).\nIn 1913, Mullin got off to a shaky 1–6 start, though his ERA remained respectable at 2.75. On May 16, 1913, the Tigers sold him to the Washington Senators for the waiver prices of $2,500. In Washington, Mullin joined a pitching staff led by Walter Johnson who won 36 games in 1913. Mullin appeared in only 11 games for the 1913 Washington team, compiling a 3–5 record and a career-high 5.02 ERA. In July 1913, Washington sold Mullin to the Montreal Royals of the International League.\nFederal League (1914–15).\nOn January 1, 1914, Mullin announced that he had come to terms to play for the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the newly formed Federal League. He said at the time: \"The fact that the Federals are willing to put two or three years' salary in the bank for players looks good to me.\" He enjoyed a one-year revival pitching for the Hoosiers in his home state of Indiana. His appeared in 36 games for the Hoosiers and compiled 14–10 record, and his 2.70 ERA ranked 10th in the Federal League. He also hit .312 with a .404 on-base percentage and 21 RBIs in 77 at bats.\nIn 1915, the Hoosiers moved east and became the Newark Pepper. Mullin played in only five games for the Newark club, compiling a 2–2 record and a 5.85 ERA. He appeared in his last Federal League game at age 34 on May 23, 1915; he was hit hard and driven from the game in the second inning. Mullin was released by Newark in late June.\nMullin concluded the 1915 season pitching for the Camden Athletic Club. He also pitched in 1916 for teams in Kokomo and Columbus, Indiana.\nCareer accomplishments and legacy.\nMullin had remarkable stamina as a pitcher. He started 428 games and had 353 complete game, the 25th highest total in major league history. He was among the American League leaders in complete games nine straight years (1903–1911) and innings pitched for eight straight years (1903–1910). His career highs were 42 complete games (1904) and innings (1905), both Tigers team records. To this day, Mullin is the Tigers' all-time innings pitched leader, both in a career (3,394) and in a season ().\nMullin was a powerfully built pitcher (often referred to as \"burly\") with an intimidating fastball, perhaps even more so due to his imperfect control. He hit batsmen 131 times in his career, the 19th highest total in major league history. He also threw 85 wild pitches and gave up 1,238 bases on balls, 45th most in major league history. He led the league in walks allowed four times (1903–1906), including a career-high 138 in 1905, and was among the league leaders in walks allowed 11 times.\nAn all-around athlete, Mullin had great range and ability to get to the ball. He contributed 1,244 assists as a pitcher, the seventh highest total of any pitcher in major league history, behind legends such as Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, and Walter Johnson. His career record of 2.56 assists per game also ranks seventh in major league history for pitchers. He had a career-high 163 assists in 1904 and twice led the league in assists by a pitcher.\nMullin was also known for the tactics he used to try to keep batters off balance. The tactics included talking to batters when they came to bat, or even talking to himself. Longtime Detroit sports writer H. G. Salsinger wrote that, while Mullin had an excellent fastball and a good curveball, \"most of his success was due to smartness rather than stuff.\" According to Salsinger, Mullin would try to distract batters with antics in between pitches – combing the pitcher's box, adjusting his belt, cleaning non-existent dirt from his glove, tying or removing his shoes –all in the hope of upsetting the batter and inducing him to swing at a bad pitch. On another occasion, Mullin and catcher Boss Schmidt hatched a successful scheme to induce Jack Chesbro to try to score from third base by bouncing a wild pitch off the stands so that it rebounded to Schmidt who then threw to Mullin for the tag on Chesbro.\nMullin also excelled as a batter. He had a career .262 batting average (401-for-1,531) with a .319 on-base percentage. He had 96 extra base hits (70 doubles, 23 triples, 3 home runs), 122 bases on balls, and 18 stolen bases. He hit three doubles in his first major league start and batted .325 in his rookie season. He was such a reliable hitter that he was used 101 times (with 21 hits) as a pinch hitter. On September 18, 1906, Mullin even pinch hit for Ty Cobb. Cobb was slumping and manager Bill Armour summoned Mullin to bat for Cobb in the bottom of the 9th inning. According to the next day's account in the Detroit Free Press, Mullin \"hit center field with a triple.\"\nYet, as one author noted: \"The pitching prowess and significant achievements of George Mullin seem to have faded away on the brittle pages of baseball history. Not even in the Motor City ... is the name of George Mullin, the burly right-hander from Wabash, Indiana, mentioned.\"\nLater years.\nMullin was married to the former Grace Aukerman. They had a daughter, Beatrice (Mrs. Lemoine) Rish.\nAfter retiring from baseball, Mullin took a job in 1919 with a motor truck company in Wabash, Indiana. In 1923, he was reportedly working as a police officer in Toledo, Ohio. In his later years, Mullin suffered from a long illness that reduced his weight to 100 pounds. He died in 1944 at age 63 in Wabash.\nMullin was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1962."

        "title": "Feder (fencing)",
        "text": "The Feder (plural \"Federn\"; also \"Fechtfeder\", plural \"Fechtfedern\"), is a type of training sword used in \"Fechtschulen\" (fencing schools) of the German Renaissance.\nThe type has existed since at least the 15th century, but it came to be widely used as a standard training weapon only in the 16th century (when longsword fencing had ceased to have a serious aspect of duelling, as duels were now fought with the rapier), \nshown extensively in the fighting manuals of the time, particularly those of Paulus Hector Mair and Joachim Meyer, and it remained in use in such \"Fechtschulen\" well into the 17th, and in some cases for much of the 18th century.\nThe origin of the term \"Feder\" for these swords is uncertain. The German word \"Feder\" means \"feather\" or \"quill\", but came to be used of metal springs in the 17th century (i.e. at about the same time as the name of the sparring weapon and possibly influenced by it). The term \"Fechtfeder\" itself seems to be connected to the name of the Federfechter, i.e. \"feather fencers\", a guild or brotherhood of fencers formed in 1570 in Prague. It is possible that the term \"Feder\" for the sparring sword arose in the late 16th century at first as a term of derision of the practice weapon used by the \"Federfechter\" (who were so called for unrelated reasons, because of a feather or quill used as their heraldic emblem) by their rivals, the Marx Brothers, who would tease the \"Federfechter\" as \"fencing with quills\" as opposed to with real weapons, or as scholars or academics supposedly better at \"fighting with the quill\" than at real fighting (reflecting the different professional backgrounds of the rival fencing guilds). Johann Fischart in his \"Gargantua\" (1575) already compares the fencing weapon to a \"quill\" writing in blood.\nThe recharacterized term \"Federschwert\" is modern.\nThe sword consists of a very thin, rounded blade with a large ricasso and a heavy hilt and pommel. Because of this, it has the same weight and center of balance as a real sword, and handles identically. This odd construction also has the effect of moving the sword's center of percussion to a theoretical point beyond its tip. The tip of a \"Federschwert\" is spatulated and may have been covered with a leather sleeve to make thrusting safer, though no direct historical evidence exists of such use. \nProduction of \"Fechtfedern\" has been revived in the 21st century for use as sparring weapons and for competition in the context of the Historical European martial arts revival. Among some HEMA groups, it is believed that certain historical Federn had gradually thinning hilts, though this is not always applied to modern reconstructions of the weapons. Additionally, the Schilden, the blade-catchers, of the modern reconstructions vary from flat squares to double-troughed Parierhaken. Some also have hilts customized into the shape of a wayward \"S\", and others' are extended about two inches. Pommel shapes also vary, between classic spheres, various polyhedrons, arming sword-style disks, or most commonly teardrops or eggs."

Their influences range from Eastern European and Middle-Eastern Gypsy music and Sufi poetry to bands like The Ex, the Pixies and Led Zeppelin. They disbanded in 2010 and reformed late in 2016.\nHistory.\nBaseball started as a solo project for front man, Cameron Potts (Ninetynine, Sandro) throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, recording tracks influenced by his travels through the middle east using piano, drums and often whispered vocals. Cameron began working closely with Monika Fikerle on drums and piano accordion and Steve Begovich on bass, touring Europe together in 2002. Returning to Melbourne in Cameron and Monika were joined by Japanese bassist and drummer Yoshi-Nobu Araki to record the Gods and Stars, Priests And Kings album.\nBaseball evolved to the current line-up in 2005, consisting of bass player Monika Fikerle (Love of Diagrams, Sea Scouts), drummer/vocalist Evelyn Morris (Pikelet, True Radical Miracle) and guitarist Ben Butcher (The Assassination Collective).\nIn 2005, Baseball released a five-song EP of demo tunes titled \"Taiwan – Japan Tour EP\" for their tour of Japan and Taiwan where they played the Hohaiyan Rock Festival with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Vincent Gallo and more, and where Cameron Potts smashed his violin at the end of the set.\nAfter touring Europe and Far East Asia in 2005, Baseball toured Russia, the US, the UK, Scandinavia and continental Europe in June 2006. They again toured Europe and the UK in June/July 2007.\nIn 2006, a live show was filmed on 3 cameras at Bar Open, Melbourne, featuring Baseball, The Thaw (Sydney), ni-hao! (Japan) and Sabot (Czech Republic). The show was later released on DVD by Tenzenmen (009TZM), entitled \"Live at Bar Open\". In 2006, Baseball played support to the likes of Sleater-Kinney, Saul Williams, Les Savy Fav, Amateur Party, Birushanah (Jap) and Ryokuchi (Jap).\nThe band took a break from 2010 before returning to playing and writing new songs in September 2016."

        "title": "Bombay Tournament (cricket)",
        "text": "The Bombay Tournament was an annual cricket competition held in British India between 1892 and 1946. Until 1936, matches were played on either the Gymkhana Ground in Bombay or the Deccan Gymkhana Ground in Poona, and then at the Brabourne Stadium in Bombay until the tournament was terminated in 1946. The tournament was known variously as the Bombay Presidency Match, Bombay Triangular, Bombay Quadrangular, and Bombay Pentangular, depending on the number of competing teams.\nPresidency Match.\nThe tournament had its origins in an annual match played between the European members of the Bombay Gymkhana and the Parsis of the Zoroastrian Cricket Club. The first such game was played in 1877, when the Bombay Gymkhana accepted a request for a two-day match from the Parsis. The game was played in good spirit, with the Parsis surprising the Europeans by taking a first innings lead. The Gymkhana recovered, but the match was drawn with the sides evenly poised. The challenge was played again in 1878 and looked set to become an annual event, but racial discontent intervened. From 1879 to 1883, the Parsis and Hindus of Bombay were locked in a struggle against the governing Europeans over the use of the playing fields known as the Bombay Maidan. Gymkhana members would play polo on the field, rendering much of it useless for cricket because of the large divots left by the horses, while sparing their own European-only cricket ground. With this dispute settled in favour of the natives, the Europeans versus Parsis matches resumed in 1884.\nThe 1889 game was memorable as a thrilling victory to the Parsis, with the Gymkhana being set a target of 53 to win: Parsi captain M.E. Pavri bowled well to help dismiss the Europeans for 50, giving the Parsis a two-run victory. Matches from 1892–93 are given first-class status: the match that began at Bombay Gymkhana on 26 August 1892 is considered the earliest first-class match in India. \nBy 1900, the Presidency Match – as the Europeans versus Parsis game had come to be called – was the highlight of the Bombay cricket season. In the 19 matches to this year, the teams had won eight each and drawn three.\nBombay Triangular.\nWhile the Europeans and Parsis were regularly playing against each other, the Hindu Gymkhana had been amassing its own quality players. In 1906, the Hindus challenged the Parsis to a match, but the communal differences between the clubs led the Parsis to decline. The Bombay Gymkhana stepped in and accepted the challenge, leading to the first Europeans versus Hindus match, played that February. The Hindu side ended up recording a stunning 110-run victory over the Europeans. The Hindus boasted Palwankar Baloo, who is regarded as India's first great spin bowler, and perhaps the first person from the Chamar caste to make an impact in an Indian sporting arena. He was not allowed the captaincy of the team because of his caste, but his younger brother Palwankar Vithal, a batsman, would go on to captain the Hindus in 1923, following a campaign to accord recognition to the Palwankar brothers in the wake of the anti-casteism advocated during the Indian Independence Movement.\nThe next year, 1907, saw the first Triangular tournament featuring teams from the Bombay and Hindu Gymkhanas as well as the Zoroastrian Cricket Club. From 1907 to 1911 the tournament was played in September, with the Parsis winning three times and the Europeans twice.\nBombay Quadrangular.\nIn 1912, the Muslims of the Mohammedan Gymkhana were invited to the now famous Bombay tournament, making it a Quadrangular. The tournament was held throughout World War I, but poor weather at the end of the monsoon season rained out four of the six finals played up until 1916. In 1917, the Quadrangular was moved to November/December to avoid such problems. Another change for the 1917 tournament was the use of neutral umpires for the first time. Up to this season, a European umpire appointed by the Bombay Gymkhana had always officiated, but from now on the umpires for any match would be supplied by the non-competing teams. This was one of the first uses of neutral umpires in world cricket.\nThe Quadrangular became more popular than its predecessor, and for many years formed the highlight of the Bombay year. This was against the backdrop of Mohandas K. Gandhi's campaigns for the Indian home rule. Gandhi and his followers were critical of the Quadrangular, seeing the tournament as having the effect of quelling opposition to British colonial rule by ensuring continued support toward Britain's presence and cultural influence on the Indian subcontinent. Gandhi, who had himself played cricket as a schoolboy, was not against having a cricket tournament, but was opposed to having teams formed on the basis of their religion. In 1940 he is known to have asked the \"sporting public of Bombay to revise their sporting code and to erase from it communal matches.\"\nThe 1921 tournament attracted particular attention, as the Prince of Wales visited Bombay during it. His arrival sparked three days of political rioting in Bombay, but did not disrupt the tournament. After the riots had ended, he attended the first day of the final, accepting cheers from a pro-European crowd, who eventually witnessed the Parsis prevail over the Bombay Gymkhana.\nBy the 1920s, the Gymkhanas were recruiting players from all over the Indian subcontinent, making the Bombay Quadrangular the biggest and most influential cricket tournament in India. It also inspired other local competitions, including a Triangular in Lahore and Quadrangulars in Nagpur and Karachi, that led to the rapid development of cricket throughout the region. Although the Quadrangular partly quelled discrimination on racial or caste lines, the question of religion came up in 1924. The Hindu Gymkhana initially extended an invitation to P. A. Kanickam of Bangalore to play for them. Later they discovered that the player was not a Hindu, but a Christian, and withdrew their invitation. With the Europeans not accepting Indians, and the Hindus not accepting Christians, Kanickam had no way of playing in the tournament.\nIn 1930, Gandhi's campaign reached a climax with the Salt Satyagraha, provoking civil disobedience and the arrests of 60,000 Indians. Amidst this political turmoil, the Quadrangular tournament was cancelled. It was not held again until 1934, when the cricket-starved public enthusiastically supported its reinstatement. In 1935, the sports editor of the nationalist \"Bombay Chronicle\", J. C. Maitra, suggested the Quadrangular be replaced with a geographic-zone-based tournament, to remove the racial and religious overtones. A newspaper correspondent argued an opposite case, for expansion into a Pentangular, with a team for Indian Christians. The public however clamoured for the traditional format and these suggestions were ignored.\nBombay Pentangular.\nFinally, in 1937, a fifth team, called The Rest, was admitted to the tournament. It comprised Buddhists, Jews, and Indian Christians. On the odd occasion, players from Ceylon appeared for them including at least one Hindu. The first Pentangular, however, was played between just four teams, as the Hindus withdrew in protest over not being allocated what they considered a fair share of seats in the new Brabourne Stadium.\nFrom 1938, the Pentangular attracted growing criticism as being divisive because of the communalism implicit in the makeup of the teams. This was exacerbated by the growing political movement for Indian independence, which wished to foster unity amongst Indians as opposed to competition. Eventually, amidst a backdrop of rioting and political unrest across India, the newly formed Board of Control for Cricket in India announced in 1946 that the Pentangular tournament was being abandoned, and being replaced by a zonal competition. The Ranji Trophy, in which regional teams from all over India compete, became the pre-eminent Indian cricket competition."

        "text": "PGA Tour Golf is a golf video game and the first in the \"PGA Tour\" game series. It was developed by Sterling Silver Software and released in 1990, for MS-DOS. It was initially published by Electronic Arts, which subsequently released versions of the game for Sega Genesis and Amiga in 1991, followed by a version for the SNES in 1992. By 1994, Tengen had published versions for Sega's Master System and Game Gear consoles. \"PGA Tour Golf\" received generally positive reviews for its realism, sound, and camera. Several critics considered the computer versions to be the best golf game available at the time of its release. It was followed by \"PGA Tour Golf II\".\nGameplay.\n\"PGA Tour Golf\" features three real golf courses: PGA West, TPC Avenel, and TPC Sawgrass. It also includes a fictional fourth course, Sterling Shores. Various game modes are featured, including Tournament, Driving, Putting, and Practice. In Tournament, the player competes against a total of 60 unseen players, whose statistics are displayed on a scoreboard. The player can watch a replay of any golf shot, and good shots are automatically replayed. The game includes variable wind conditions which affect where the ball will land.\nBefore starting each course, the player is given a three-dimensional view of the hole, and the camera pans from the hole to the player's starting position. To further aid the player, an overhead map of the course is shown before starting each hole and after each shot. Upon reaching the green, the player views the area as a three-dimensional contoured grid to study the uneven terrain for better putting. The player also receives advice from PGA golfers. The Amiga and Master System versions include a multiplayer option. A 1994 U.K. re-release of the Amiga version includes the three courses from \"PGA Tour Golf II\", as well as three additional tournaments.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"PGA Tour Golf\" was developed by American company Sterling Silver Software, and was initially published by Electronic Arts, which released the game for MS-DOS computers in July 1990. The following year, Electronic Arts released versions for Amiga and Sega Genesis (also known as the Mega Drive). The Genesis version was released in the U.S. in April 1991, followed by a U.K. release the next month. A Macintosh version had also been released in the U.S. by the end of 1991.\nIn March 1992, Electronics Arts published a U.S. version for the SNES. It was also released in the U.K. By 1994, Tengen had published versions for Sega's Game Gear and Master System consoles. The latter version is a conversion of the Genesis version, which was converted from the computer version. In the U.K., The Hit Squad published re-releases for the Amiga in 1994 and 1996, while a 1997 Amiga re-release was published in the U.K. by Guildhall.\nThe game's music was composed by Rob Hubbard.\nReception.\nThe computer versions received positive reviews, with several critics considering it the best golf game available at the time of its release. The computer versions were mostly praised for their graphics and realism, including the ball movements and wind conditions. The sound was mostly praised across various platforms, as was the variety of options. The camera and various perspectives were also praised. The Amiga and Genesis versions received some praise for the fast loading times of each new screen. \"Amiga Action\" stated that \"PGA Tour Golf\" stood out from other golfing games with its various features, while concluding that it could appeal to non golf fans. Phil Campbell of \"Australian Commodore and Amiga Review\" believed the game was better than \"Mean 18\", with superior graphics, improved views of the course, and more game options.\n\"The One\", reviewing the DOS version in 1990, stated that the game had a perfect balance of realism and simplistic gameplay. \"The One\" reviewed the Amiga version of \"PGA Tour Golf\" in 1991, giving it an overall score of 92%. They called it a \"brilliant conversion\" of the PC version, and further expressed that it \"has retained the energy and playability of the original PC version.\" \"The One\" criticises the 'fly-by' feature as 'jerky', as well as the game's frequent disk-accessing, although noting that the latter can be disabled though settings, and expresses that these grievances cause \"nothing major [to be] lost from the gameplay.\" \"The One\" praises \"PGA Tour Golf's\" sound effects and attention to detail, furthermore stating that \"\"PGA Tour Golf\" is \"the\" best golf game currently available.\"\nSandra Foley of \"Amiga Computing\" stated that Electronic Arts \"managed to come closer than any other to simulating actual golf.\" However, she criticized the lack of female golfers, the bland graphics, the minimal sounds, and the inclusion of \"one of the worst loading tunes I've ever heard.\" \"Amiga User International\" praised the replay modes and considered the game superior to \"Leader Board\", but criticized Hubbard's musical score as a \"grating series of fanfares\". \"Amiga Power\" considered the game easy and addictive, and called it a worthy successor to \"Leader Board\", but noted that it did not introduce any new features among golfing video games. \"ACE\" praised the game and stated that it would appeal to experienced and inexperienced golf players.\n\"Raze\" reviewed the Amiga and Genesis versions; their presentation was praised, but the Genesis version was considered superior for being easier. \"Mean Machines\" praised the Genesis version, including its multiplayer option. The magazine concluded that it was superior to \"Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf\", and stated that it would appeal to golfers as well as people who normally would not purchase golf games. \"VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment\" praised the realism of the Genesis version and considered it an impressive conversion of the computer version, while calling it a \"thoroughly entertaining, challenging and complex golf simulation.\" However, the magazine criticized the graphics, considering them inferior to \"Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf\". AllGame's Jonathan Sutyak praised the Genesis version for its realism, but felt that the graphics could be better. Reviewers for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" praised the sounds of the Genesis version but had varying opinions about the graphics; they considered the SNES version to be average.\nJonathan Davies, writing for the U.K. magazine \"Super Play\", criticized the SNES version for its \"horrible\" colors, jerky camera scrolling, and unrealistic ball movements, but stated that it played as well as the computer versions and was enjoyable. Davies concluded that it was not the best SNES golf game but that it was a \"reasonable stop-gap until something better makes it over to this country.\" \"N-Force\" considered the swing animation in the SNES version to be somewhat jerky, and stated that the swing control method was inconsistent and frustrating. The magazine criticized the bland graphics and minimal backgrounds, but praised the fast and smooth animation of the ball while it is in flight to the hole.\n\"Mean Machines\" praised the Master System version, considering it the console's best golf game. The magazine stated that it played as good as other versions of the game, and considered it superior to the SNES version, although slow screen reanimation was criticized. \"GamePro\" stated that the Game Gear version mostly fulfilled its goal to provide good golfing on the console, but considered it an average game. The magazine criticized the minimal sounds and music, and stated that the courses looked too similar to each other. \"Game Players\" stated that the Game Gear version had relatively good graphics but poor gameplay, criticizing unpredictable and inaccurate shooting distances. The magazine stated that the Game Gear version was not as good as the Genesis version.\n\"Mega\", in its October 1992 issue, placed \"PGA Tour Golf\" at number 10 on its list of Top Mega Drive Games of All Time. In 1994, \"PC Gamer UK\" named \"PGA Tour Golf\" the 48th best computer game of all time. The editors wrote, \"It may be old, but games as good as this deserve a look-in even ten years down the line\".\nAmiga re-releases.\nReviewers noted the outdated graphics of the Amiga re-releases, and some considered \"PGA European Tour\" to be a superior game. \"The One\" called the 1994 version a \"superb\" re-release that was \"well overdue,\" and attributed the game's initial success to it being a \"true\" golf simulator. Stephen Bradley of \"Amiga Format\" praised the additional courses, and stated that while the graphics were not comparable to \"Nick Faldo's Championship Golf\" or the \"Links\" series, the game was still easy to play. Bradley concluded that \"PGA Tour Golf\" \"remains one of the Amiga's most compelling and enduring games.\"\n\"Amiga Power\" praised the gameplay options. Tony Dillon of \"CU Amiga\" stated that the game revolutionized computer golf upon its initial release, and that \"while many of its contemporaries are far more sophisticated and even more playable, none have ever been as original.\" However, the magazine stated that the game had not aged well, and called its control method \"clumsy and uncomfortable.\"\nIn 1996, Steve McGill of \"Amiga Format\" wrote that despite the dated graphics, \"PGA Tour Golf\" still had \"timeless appeal\". In 1997, Martin Davies of \"CU Amiga\" called the game an \"essential buy for all golf and sports fans,\" praising the variety, easy gameplay, and lasting appeal. \"Amiga Computing\" also praised its easy gameplay."

        "title": "Cadence (cycling)",
        "text": "In cycling, cadence is a measure of rotational speed of the crank, expressed in units of revolutions per minute (r/min or rpm). In other words, it is the pedalling rate at which a cyclist is turning the pedals. Cadence is directly proportional to wheel speed, but is a distinct measurement and changes with gearing. In other words, the gearing changes the ratio of the crank's rotational speed (cadence) to that of the drive wheel's rotational speed.\nTypical cadence.\nCyclists typically have a cadence at which they feel most comfortable, and on bicycles with many gears it is possible to maintain a preferred cadence at a wide range of speeds. \nCyclists choose cadence to minimise muscular fatigue, and not metabolic demand, since oxygen consumption is lower at cadences 60-70 r/min. \nWhile fast cadence is also referred to as \"spinning\", slow cadence is referred to as \"mashing\" or \"grinding\".\nAny particular cyclist has only a narrow range of preferred cadences, often smaller than the general ranges listed above. This in turn influences the number and range of gears which are appropriate for any particular cycling conditions.\nSensors.\nCadence can be measured via various types of sensors, for example a simple reed switch and a magnet which detects one revolution each time the crank arm passes a point on the frame, or more advanced sensors based on a force sensor (e.g. pedals), torque sensor (e.g. crank arms) or other types of cycling power sensors.\nPresentation.\nThe cadence can be presented on a smartphone via Bluetooth, on an LCD display via cable, or on a GPS or cyclocomputer via ANT+, typically mounted on the bicycle's handlebars."

        "title": "Jimmie Wilson (baseball)",
        "text": "James Wilson (July 23, 1900 – May 31, 1947), nicknamed \"Ace\", was an American professional athlete in soccer and baseball. He began his professional sports career as a soccer outside right in the National Association Football League and American Soccer League before becoming a catcher, manager and coach in Major League Baseball. Wilson was the starting catcher for the National League in baseball's first All-Star game. He threw and batted right-handed and was listed at tall and .\nSoccer.\nWilson, the son of Scottish immigrants, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he grew up in the Kensington neighborhood of the city. He left school when he was 14 to work in a local textile mill. In 1919, he left the mills when he began playing as an outside forward with Philadelphia Merchant Ship B in the National Association Football League. During his time with the team, he met Dick Spalding, another two sport athlete, whom he later hired as his first base coach when Wilson managed the Phillies and Cubs. After Merchant Ship folded following the 1919-1920 season, Wilson moved to Bethlehem Steel F.C., signing with the team in July 1920. During his time in Bethlehem, he also played catcher for the steel company's baseball team which competed in the Steel League. In 1921, Wilson signed with Harrison S.C. in the newly established American Soccer League. He played thirteen league and three National Challenge Cup games, scoring four goals. During the 1922-1923 season, he played four games for Philadelphia Field Club before leaving the sport to concentrate on his baseball career.\nBaseball.\nDuring his years playing first division soccer, Wilson also made a name for himself as an excellent baseball player. When he signed with Bethlehem Steel in July 1920, the local newspaper stated, \"The addition of Wilson would be a most welcome one, because his campaigning on the baseball diamond has been as brilliant as that in soccer circles. At present he is on the receiving end of the battery for the New Haven team in the Eastern League.\"\nIn February 1923, he gave up his soccer career when he was traded from New Haven in the Eastern League to the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League for Stan Baumgartner and Jack Withrow. Wilson's National League playing career would stretch over 18 seasons (1923–40) with the Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals and the Cincinnati Reds. He hit over .300 four times as a regular catcher and for his career batted .284 in 1,525 games.\nIn 1928, he joined baseball history when he was traded by the Phillies to the Cardinals during a game between the two teams. According to one account, \"Wilson was a Phil for two innings, then darted into Redbird regalia, and sat on the St. Louis bench, for the remainder of the game.\" After the 1933 season, he was traded back to the Phillies for fellow catcher Spud Davis and infielder Eddie Delker.\nFrom 1934 through 1938, he was the player-manager of his hometown Phillies, one of the worst teams in baseball at the time. He guided the Phils to three seventh place and two eighth (last) place finishes; in his final season, Philadelphia lost 103 of 149 games. He then joined the Cincinnati coaching staff in 1939 and played only four games that season.\nWilson umpired a major league game in 1940, under unusual circumstances. A game on April 23 between the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals had been postponed, and when it was about to be played at Crosley Field on May 13, it was found that no umpires had been assigned by the National League. Umpire Larry Goetz, who lived in Cincinnati, was summoned to the ballpark and served as home plate umpire. Wilson umpired at first base, and Cardinals' pitcher Lon Warneke umpired at third base. The game ended as an 8–8 tie after 14 innings, called due to darkness.\nIn August 1940, the Reds were stunned when Willard Hershberger, backup catcher to future Baseball Hall of Famer Ernie Lombardi, committed suicide in his Boston hotel room. The 40-year-old Wilson came off the coaching lines and joined the active roster, serving as the club's third catcher behind Lombardi and rookie Bill Baker. He played three games in August, but then in September Lombardi injured his ankle, and Wilson was pressed into starting duty. Splitting time with Baker and Dick West, Wilson played in 16 games during the pennant race, batting .243. When Lombardi was unable to return for more than spot duty in the 1940 World Series, Wilson came through, batting .353 in six games and playing a key role in Cincinnati's defeat of the Detroit Tigers, four games to three, for the world championship.\nHis stardom in the 1940 Fall Classic led to his second and last major league managing job, with the Chicago Cubs (1941–44), but he never had a winning record in Wrigleyville and his highest finish was fifth, in 1943. The following season, Wison resigned as manager of the Cubs after the team followed up an opening day victory with nine straight defeats to open the season. He was replaced by Roy Johnson for one game before Charlie Grimm took over as manager of the Cubs; that team finished fourth in 1944 before winning the pennant the following year. His final record as a manager, over nine full or partial seasons was: 493 wins and 735 losses (.401). Wilson has the dubious record of losses under .500 as a manager with 242. He also ranks 17th in lowest winning percentage for a manager (.401).\nWilson returned to Cincinnati as a coach in 1945–46. Released along with Reds manager Bill McKechnie at the end of the 1946 season, Wilson moved to Florida and entered the citrus growing business. He died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 46 the following May in Bradenton.\nPersonal.\nWilson was also the father of 2nd Lt. Robert J. Wilson, a B-29 Flight Crew member who died in a training accident in Kharagpur, India on November 28, 1944."

The rest of his career, which lasted from 1962 to 1974, was spent in the minor leagues.\nEarly life.\nCorbett was born in Toronto. After playing junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey Association for the Toronto St. Michael's Majors from 1959 to 1962 and the Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons from 1962 to 1963.\nCareer.\nCorbett made his professional debut with the Sudbury Wolves of the Eastern Professional Hockey League in 1962. His participation in the league however was short-lived as the EPHL folded following the season's conclusion, forcing Corbett to look elsewhere to play. Eventually, he signed with the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League whilst also splitting the 1963–1964 season with the Denver Invaders of the Western Hockey League.\nIn 1964, Corbett joined the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Professional Hockey League and spent the entire 1964–1965 season with the team. After that, he split the next season with three different teams, the AHL's Baltimore Clippers, the CPHL's Minnesota Rangers and the WHL's Victoria Maple Leafs during their playoff run. He then had short spells in the AHL with the Providence Reds and the Springfield Indians, playing five games with each team, before joining the Vancouver Canucks of the WHL.\nCorbett would play in 70 regular season games for the Canucks, scoring 17 goals and 21 assists, for 38 points. Despite this, the Canucks finished last the standings and missed the playoffs. Following this, the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League offered him a spot in their playoff roster and Corbett played in two games for the Kings during their 1968 Stanley Cup playoff quarter-final against the Minnesota North Stars, which they lost four games to three. Corbett notched up one assist and two penalty minutes in the two games he played.\nAfter his brief NHL run came to an end, Corbett played one more season in the professional minor leagues, splitting the year in the International Hockey League with the Dayton Gems as well as back in the AHL with the Springfield Kings before finishing his career playing senior hockey level in the OHA Senior A League. He played for Galt Hornets, Oakville Oaks, Orillia Terriers and the Brantford Foresters from 1969 to 1974. \nAfter retiring from playing hockey in 1974, Corbett became an usher at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario. \nPersonal life.\nCorbett died of cancer at the age of 60, on January 9, 2003, in Burlington, Ontario and was cremated."

        "title": "John McKay (American football)",
        "text": "John Harvey McKay (July 5, 1923 – June 10, 2001) was an American football coach. He was the head coach at the University of Southern California (USC) from 1960 to 1975 and of the National Football League's Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1976 to 1984. In sixteen seasons at USC, McKay compiled a record of and won nine AAWU/Pac-8 conference titles. His teams made eight appearances in the Rose Bowl, with five wins. Four of his squads captured national titles (1962, 1967, 1972, 1974).\nFollowing a disappointing 1975 season, McKay moved to the NFL as the first head coach of the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 1976 and 1977, Tampa Bay lost the first 26 games but improved by the end of the 1970s. The Bucs made the playoffs three times under McKay, including an appearance in the NFC Championship Game in 1979. McKay was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1988. On January 1, 2014, McKay was named the All-Century Coach of the Rose Bowl Game during the celebration of the 100th Rose Bowl Game; his son represented him in the 2014 Rose Parade.\nEarly life, military service, and playing career.\nMcKay was born in West Virginia in the now-defunct town of Everettville in Monongalia County, where he was raised as a Roman Catholic. He was the third of five children born to Scots-Irish parents John and Gertrude McKay. His father was a coal mine superintendent who died when John was 13 years old. He grew up in Shinnston, and graduated from Shinnston High School in 1941. Offered a football scholarship to Wake Forest, McKay was on campus enrolling when his widowed mother became ill. He returned home to West Virginia and worked as an electrician's assistant in a coal mine for a year, then enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force in 1942. McKay served as a tailgunner aboard B-29s and saw action in the Pacific Theatre during World War II.\nOregon.\nAfter the war, he entered college at Purdue University in 1946 at the age of 23, then transferred to the University of Oregon in 1947. He played football as a halfback at both schools. At Purdue he played under former NFL Champion Quarterback Cecil Isbell alongside Bob DeMoss and Ed Cody, and split time with Ed Ehlers. For the Oregon Webfoots, he played alongside quarterback Norm Van Brocklin. The 1948 Webfoots went 9–1 in the regular season and 7–0 in the Pacific Coast, co-champions with California. Because the two teams did not meet during the season, the bid to the Rose Bowl was decided by the university presidents, which went to California on a split vote that was not disclosed. Breaking with tradition, the PCC allowed the co-champions to also play in a bowl game. The Webfoots accepted an invitation to the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, but were defeated 21–13 by hometown SMU.\nVan Brocklin graduated and was selected in the 1949 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams; McKay took over the Webfoot offense in 1949 and called the audibles from his two-point stance as a running back. Without the future NFL Hall of Famer, the Webfoots slipped to 4–6 (2–5 in the PCC). Without McKay on the field in 1950, Oregon was 1–9 and winless in conference, including shutouts by UCLA and lowly Idaho. The Webfoots scored only 97 points all season and were kept under ten points in half of their games.\nCoaching career.\nAssistant coach.\nAfter graduation from Oregon in 1950, McKay decided to become a coach. He was an assistant for the Ducks for nine seasons, one under Jim Aiken and eight with Len Casanova, who arrived from the University of Pittsburgh in 1951. Improving through the 1950s, the Ducks tied for the conference title in 1957 and played in the 1958 Rose Bowl. Following the 1958 season, McKay moved south to USC as an assistant under third-year head coach Don Clark. A notable member of the USC staff at this time was Al Davis, the offensive line coach. The Trojans were coming off two losing seasons, 1–9 in 1957 and 4–5–1 in 1958. They won their first eight games in 1959 but lost to rivals UCLA and Notre Dame to conclude the season. After failing to defeat either of the two rivals in three years, Clark resigned. McKay was hired as the Trojans' head coach for the 1960 season.\nUSC Trojans.\nIn his first two seasons as head coach, McKay's teams enjoyed little success, going 4–6 in 1960 and 4–5–1 in 1961. The Trojans had been on probation and had difficulty recruiting; McKay stated that these two teams were the slowest he had ever been around. Heading into the 1962 season, McKay felt he might be fired by university president Norman Topping; alumni were pressuring Topping to fire McKay, but Topping resisted and gave McKay one more year so he could field a team with players he had recruited. Topping believed that McKay had recruited well and that the team would be successful. Topping proved to be correct. In 1962, McKay guided USC to an 11–0 record, including a 42–37 Rose Bowl victory over #2-ranked Wisconsin, leading to a national championship. USC won a total of four national championships (1962, 1967, 1972, and 1974) during McKay's tenure as head coach, and the 1972 squad is regarded as one of the best teams in college football history. That team went 12–0, defeating five teams ranked 18th or higher by an average of 22 points. They never trailed in the second half of any game, and their closest game was a nine-point win over Stanford. Players from that team included Mike Rae, Pat Haden, Sam Cunningham, Anthony Davis, Lynn Swann, Charle Young, Gary Jeter, Richard Wood and Charles Phillips. Two of his players, Mike Garrett (1965) and O. J. Simpson (1968), won the Heisman Trophy. McKay popularized the I formation and emphasized a power running game with such plays as \"Student Body Left\" and \"Student Body Right.\" Through 2021, he remains the winningest head football coach in school history.\nOn November 26, 1966, Notre Dame crushed USC 51–0 for the worst defeat in the program's history. Reportedly, after the game, McKay vowed never to lose a game to the Fighting Irish again. He denied saying it, however, and in an interview shortly before his death, he clarified that he actually said, \"They'll never beat us 51–0 again.\" After that loss, McKay was 6–1–2 vs. Notre Dame, losing only during the Irish' national championship season of 1973. He even admitted that while growing up, being an Irish Catholic, he was a Notre Dame fan.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nAfter turning down several offers from NFL teams, including the Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams, McKay was lured to Tampa Bay in 1976 to become the Bucs' first head coach. Motivating his decision was the combined fivefold salary increase (totaling $2 million) and the prospect of building a franchise from the ground up. The Buccaneers lost all 14 games in 1976 and the first 12 games of 1977 before finally winning against the New Orleans Saints. The Bucs would also win the last game of the 1977 season over the St. Louis Cardinals for a two-game winning streak.\nAfter winning five games in 1978, the Buccaneers doubled that the following year, posting their first winning season. They clinched the 1979 NFC Central title in the final week by beating the Kansas City Chiefs 3–0 in a driving Tampa rainstorm. They then defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24–17 in a divisional playoff game to advance to the NFC Championship where, in a defensive battle, they lost to the Los Angeles Rams 9–0. The Buccaneers made two more playoff appearances in 1981 and 1982.\nAfter the 1982 season, McKay strongly supported star quarterback Doug Williams' bid for a better contract; at the time he was making less than 12 backups in the league. However, owner Hugh Culverhouse was unwilling to budge from his initial offer. Williams bolted to the USFL for the 1983 season. Without Williams, McKay's offense appeared to be completely rudderless. The Buccaneers suffered through a two-win season in 1983, and although they rebounded to win six in 1984, it would be McKay's last. Thoroughly disillusioned, he stepped down as head coach. In the end, despite the Bucs' brief success in the early 1980s, McKay forever regretted his decision to leave the Trojans. His son noted that he knew \"within the first week after he got to Tampa that he'd made a mistake.\" McKay later said that, despite the team's rapid ascent to the playoffs, the Tampa Bay Area fans never forgave him for the franchise's 0–26 start. McKay's record with the Buccaneers (his entire NFL career) was a dismal 44–88–1. Despite this, McKay was posthumously inducted into Tampa Bay's \"Ring of Honor\" on December 5, 2010.\nAs an NFL coach, McKay proved to be a controversial figure. He had an unpredictable personality and was capable of great warmth, but also of scathing sarcasm. Veterans felt that his aloofness hampered his ability to communicate with the team. Near the end of his tenure of head coach, he upset players by not addressing the team at any point before or after the game. He was prone to emotional outbursts, as when he called fans \"idiots\" for booing Bucs' quarterback Steve Spurrier during the expansion season, and then again later when he applied the term to reporters and opposing players who criticized the team. A 1977 wave of offseason firings saw several executives replaced by men with close ties to McKay, and left the suspicion that he was attempting to surround himself with a staff that would bow easily to his will. Similar accusations were made surrounding his handling of personnel, particularly following the 1976 season and again in the wake of a 1982 trade that sent several players to the San Diego Chargers, alleging that his intolerance of outspoken players was causing him to cut players who could help the team. Some players resented McKay for placing his son Johnny in the starting lineup when they felt that there were better receivers on the team, a move for which McKay humorously gave \"nepotism\" as the motivation.\nCritics frequently questioned whether McKay's biting comments were detrimental to players, some of which described his conduct as \"unprofessional\". McKay was noted for using the press to criticize players, as when he complained about a young running back's pass-catching ability by sarcastically referring to him as \"fabulous\". He responded to the ensuing controversy by repeatedly stating, \"all of the players played lovely\" at the following week's postgame press conference, despite the game having been a loss that eliminated the team from playoff contention. Conversely, McKay could be fiercely protective of his players. He took the media to task for publishing subtly racist descriptions of Doug Williams that insinuated that his mental capacity was inferior, and continually referred to him as a \"black quarterback\" instead of \"a quarterback\". A public apology was required after he leveled a string of expletives against a group of fans who had directed racist comments at his players. Despite his adversarial personal relationship with Spurrier, McKay defended him against fans' criticism. He enraged the New York Jets and incurred a large league fine in his final game, in which his attempt to secure an NFL yardage record for running back James Wilder Sr. went to such extremes as to order the defense to lie down and allow the Jets to score a touchdown, in order to quickly regain possession of the ball.\nAt 44 games under .500 McKay set the record for futility surpassing Bert Bell in 1983, a record he held until Marion Campbell passed him in 1988.\nFamily and death.\nMcKay was the father of former Buccaneers general manager Rich McKay, the current president of the Atlanta Falcons. Another son, J. K. McKay, played wide receiver under him twice: first for the Trojans from 1972–75 and then later in the NFL for the Buccaneers from 1976–1979. McKay and his wife, Corky, had two daughters, Michele McKay Breese and Terri McKay Florio.\nMcKay died at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, Florida, from diabetes-related complications on June 10, 2001, at the age of 77. His ashes were spread on the field of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. For his contribution to sports in Los Angeles, he was honored with a Coliseum \"Court of Honor\" plaque by the Coliseum commissioners.\nQuips.\nMcKay became famous for many of his humorous answers during press conferences, for which Philadelphia Eagles coach Dick Vermeil called him \"Dial-a-Quote\".

        "text": "David Peter Wallace (born 8 July 1976) is an Irish retired rugby union player, who played for Munster, Ireland and the British &amp; Irish Lions. He normally played as an openside flanker, but could also play blindside flanker and number 8.\nEarly life.\nWallace grew up in Limerick on Ennis Road, and later lived in Cork. He was educated at Crescent College\nMunster.\nWallace made his Munster debut against Connacht in August 1997. He made his European debut against Harlequins in September 1997 in the 1997–98 Heineken Cup.\nWallace started for Munster in the 2000 Heineken Cup Final. He scored his side's only try but opponents Northampton Saints eventually won 9–8. Wallace again started for Munster during the 2002 Heineken Cup Final against Leicester Tigers. Once again, Munster lost narrowly, being defeated 15–9.\nInjury ruled Wallace out of much of the 2002–03 Celtic League, meaning he missed Munster's victory against Neath that won the league.\nHis first taste of silverware with Munster came against Scarlets in the Celtic Cup Final in May 2005.\nWallace scored the fourth try in Munster's win over Sale in the 2005–06 Heineken Cup to take the Irish province into a home quarter-final against USA Perpignan. After defeating Perpignan in the quarter final, Munster beat arch-rivals Leinster 30–6 in the semi-final to reach their third Heineken Cup final. At the Millennium Stadium, Munster beat Biarritz Olympique 23–19 to win the 2006 Heineken Cup Final. This was Munster's, and Wallace's, first Heineken Cup Final victory.\nMunster, and Wallace, again secured Heineken Cup success when they beat Toulouse 16–13 in the 2008 Heineken Cup Final.\nWallace was part of the Munster team that won the 2008–09 Magners League.\nIn February 2011, Wallace extended his contract with Munster until the end of the 2011–12 season.\nWallace became the sixth player to reach 200 caps for Munster against Leinster during the 2011 Magners League Grand Final, a game in which he won the Man of the Match award.\nHaving returned to full training after the knee injury that ruled him out of the 2011 World Cup and 2012 Six Nations, Wallace was named in the Munster squad to travel to Aironi on 7 March 2012. He made his comeback during the game, playing the last 20 minutes. Wallace continued his comeback by playing the first 40 minutes of Munster A's friendly against a Munster Development team on 16 March. He was added to Munster's 2011–12 Heineken Cup squad in March 2012. Wallace made his first appearance in the 2011–12 Heineken Cup season in the quarter-final against Ulster on 8 April 2012. This turned out to be Wallace's last game for Munster, as a recurrence of the knee injury suffered in August 2011 forced him to retire in May 2012.\nIreland.\nWallace made his Ireland debut against Argentina on 3 June 2000.\nOn 10 June 2000, Wallace was part of the Ireland team that recorded their largest win by beating the United States 83–3.\nThree lengthy injury-enforced absences hindered Wallace's international development. He only played in five games for Ireland until returning to start in the Triple Crown victory over Scotland in the 2004 Six Nations Championship — scoring a vital try in the process. He started again in both Tests in 2004 against South Africa.\nHe did not return again to the Irish side until the second Test against Japan in June 2005, where he scored his fourth international try.\nHis form for Munster saw him earn a recall to the Irish set-up in 2006. He was present during the 2006 Six Nations Championship and the Summer Tour in June.\nWallace scored a try for Ireland in their 43–13 demolition of England in the 2007 Six Nations Championship, and his form saw him selected in Ireland's squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. He started all four of Ireland's pool games at the tournament.\nWallace was a member of the Irish Grand Slam winning side in 2009.\nWallace kept his place in the Ireland team for the November Tests in 2009, and played a crucial role in the win over South Africa. He played in all 5 of Ireland's 2010 Six Nations Championship games and won the Man-of-the-Match award against Italy. Wallace was in outstanding form for Munster throughout the 2009/10 season, and was selected in Ireland's squad for the summer tour to New Zealand and Australia. He played against New Zealand and came on as a substitute against the New Zealand Maori before returning home for the birth of his second child. He played against South Africa, New Zealand and Argentina during Ireland's 2010 Autumn Tests, and became Ireland's most capped back-row player. Wallace played in all five of Ireland's 2011 Six Nations Championship games, including the 24–8 victory over England at Aviva Stadium that ended England's hopes of a Grand Slam.\nWallace was selected in Ireland's training squad for the 2011 World Cup warm-ups in August, and was also selected in the final 30-man squad. However, a knee injury sustained during Ireland's final warm-up game against England ruled Wallace out of the tournament in New Zealand.\nFollowing the injury, he was ruled out of action for six months, which also ruled Wallace out of the 2012 Six Nations Championship.\nBritish &amp; Irish Lions.\nWallace toured Australia with the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions following in the footsteps of his brothers Richard and Paul. He played against NSW Country Districts, and scored a try against ACT Brumbies.\nOn 21 April 2009, Wallace was named in the Lions' squad for the tour to South Africa. He started the first and second tests, and came on as a substitute for the third.\nRetirement.\nWallace announced his retirement from rugby on 3 May 2012, due to the knee injury he suffered in August 2011. Wallace had made a comeback from the injury, but a re-occurrence of the injury forced him to quit the game.\nSpeaking at the announcement,\n\"Although it's disappointing that injury is forcing me to retire now, I take great comfort that I've had an unbelievably enjoyable career and I feel very lucky to have been involved in an era that has seen Munster and Ireland enjoy so much success. Professional rugby has exploded in popularity and changed beyond all recognition in this country since I began and I feel honored to have played witness to its massive improvement. I'd like to thank anyone who has helped me and had faith in me during my 15 year professional career including family, teammates, coaches, medics, friends and not least supporters. I will be looking to step away from rugby and explore a few different business opportunities while also looking forward to being able to spend more time with my wife Aileen and sons Andrew and Harvey.\"\nSince his retirement from rugby, Wallace has opened a sweet shop in Limerick. In 2017 he joined Bank of Ireland as a Business Development Manager for the Munster region.\nStatistics.\nInternational analysis by opposition.\nCorrect as of 5 July 2017"

Surrey's season was dominated by draws, with fourteen out of 26 games drawn, just like the season in general – especially the Australian team's tour. Four of the five Test matches were drawn during the 19th series between the sides, but Australia won the second Test at Lord's and the series 1–0. This was their first Ashes series win in England since the original match in 1882.\nAlso, Worcestershire became the fifteenth county in the County Championship, debuting with an 11-run loss to Yorkshire despite earning a 78-run lead on first innings. George Wilson took eight for 70 in the first innings, which was a Worcestershire Championship record until Wilson beat it against Somerset in 1905. The debutants finished twelfth, though they only earned two wins in 12 games. Finally, Sussex' Ranjitsinhji became the first batsman to hit 2000 runs in a Championship season with 102 against Lancashire in August.\nThe season was a notable one for WG Grace. The First Test marked his final appearance for England (and the Test debut of Wilfred Rhodes).

        "title": "World League Against Alcoholism",
        "text": "The World League Against Alcoholism (WLAA) was organized by the Anti-Saloon League, whose goal became establishing prohibition not only in the United States but throughout the entire world.\nAs ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment creating prohibition in the U.S. neared, Anti-Saloon leader Ernest Cherrington promoted the creation of the WLAA, which was founded in 1919. Members and supporters of the WLAA saw alcohol as \"the poisoning of the body, germ-plasm, mind, conduct and society.\"\nHistory.\nThe WLAA was formed in Washington, D.C., by Ernest Cherrington. Concerned about alcohol abuse, he left a teaching job to become a reporter and critic of alcohol. Then, in 1901, “the Ohio ASL [Anti-Saloon League] appointed him assistant head. Next, the Washington state ASL appointed him its leader.” Cherrington then went on to help found the WLAA in 1919, at the age of 42. At the time, the \"Sunday Star\" described Cherrington as having \"the charm and ease of manner of a senator in his palmiest days\". He was elected general secretary and instructed to open permanent offices for the WLAA in Washington. Miles Yokes from Toronto, Canada, was chosen as treasurer.\nIn 1919, these were the countries who were expected to join the WLAA:  \nIn 1922, Anna Adams Gordon was elected to be one of the presidents of the WLAA. She spoke at a conference in 1922, in Toronto, and her message was “a plea for closer cooperation on the part of all temperance organizations everywhere for the great common objective of ‘the fight for a clear brain.’”\nThe WLAA wanted to target Scotland first, because they believed that if they were successful in Scotland, then England, Ireland and Wales would soon follow. Cherrington also wanted to bring prohibition to Japan. He chose Japan because of its progressiveness. He believed that China and other countries near Japan would follow in Japan’s footsteps. Cherrington believed that Germany might even be one of the first countries in Europe to adopt prohibition. He thought this because, even though Germany was one of the most beer drinking countries in the world, German scientists and educators had done scientific studies on alcoholic beverages and the negative effects of them.\nFollowing the repeal of prohibition in 1933, the Anti-Saloon League's fortunes fell dramatically, with its bank failing. It became unable to continue supporting the World League Against Alcoholism. Cherrington was forced to lead it with little income. Following the Great Depression, the World League failed and fell out of existence.\nConstitution.\nPart of the constitution of the WLAA stated:\n“The object of this league is to attain by means of education and legislation the total suppression throughout the world of alcoholism, which is the poisoning of body germ-plasm, mind, conduct and society, produced by the consumption of alcoholic beverages. This league pledges itself to avoid affiliation with any political party as such, and to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality on all questions of public policy not directly and immediately concerned with the traffic in alcoholic beverages.”\nIt also stated that the WLAA would have a meeting every 3 years, starting in October 1919, in Washington.\nActivities.\nThis league spread awareness of their goals by publishing cartoons, encyclopedias (the \"Standard Encyclopedia of the Alcohol Problem\"), fliers, periodicals, songs, stories, dramas and yearbooks. These publications appealed to intellect and emotion. For example, here are two different fliers, one appealed to intellect and another appealed to emotion. A pamphlet written by Cherrington for the WLAA says that youth should have the right to know all the facts about alcoholic beverages, since it could greatly affect “physical fitness, social hygiene and the general public weal.”\nThe WLAA assisted speakers and educational materials to advance an international temperance movement spanning six continents. Their first international convention was held in 1923, with attendees from 66 countries.\nTemperance movements from around the world gave support and cooperation to the WLAA. Examples of these temperance movements were the National Temperance League in Japan, the New Zealand alliance for the abolition of liquor traffic, the Irish Temperance League, the Temperance Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, etc. Poster, educational materials and speakers were provided to help promote the cause worldwide.\nNotable people.\nPresidents.\nThe WLAA presidents included:"

        "text": "Eugene Keefe Robinson (born May 28, 1963) is an American former football safety who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons. He spent the majority of his career with the Seattle Seahawks, who signed him as an undrafted free agent in 1985. In addition to his 11 seasons with the Seahawks, he was a member of the Green Bay Packers and Atlanta Falcons for two seasons each and the Carolina Panthers for one season.\nDuring his Seattle tenure, Robinson was named to two Pro Bowls and led the league in interceptions in 1993. Robinson's two seasons with the Packers saw him reach the Super Bowl in both years and win Super Bowl XXXI. With the Falcons, he earned a third Pro Bowl selection and made a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nAfter playing college football at Colgate University, Robinson spent his first 11 NFL seasons with the Seahawks, being selected to the Pro Bowl twice in 1992 and 1993. Robinson is the Seahawks' 2nd all-time tackle leader and second in interceptions.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nAfter the 1995 season, Robinson signed with the Packers. That year, he recorded 55 tackles and led Green Bay with eight interceptions. After the 1996 season, the Packers went on to win Super Bowl XXXI 35–21, over his hometown team, the New England Patriots, earning Robinson a championship ring. Then again, after the 1997 season, Robinson and the Packers went to Super Bowl XXXII, however they lost 31–24, to the Denver Broncos. With his team trailing 24–17 in the third quarter, Robinson intercepted a pass from Broncos quarterback John Elway in the end zone, preventing Denver from building a bigger lead and setting up a touchdown on Green Bay's ensuing drive to tie the game. He also recorded an interception of Steve Young that set up a touchdown in the Packers 23–10 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC title game two weeks prior.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nAfter the 1997 season, Robinson joined the Atlanta Falcons in 1998. During the season, Robinson recorded 46 tackles, two fumble recoveries, four interceptions, and one touchdown return, earning his third career Pro Bowl selection. After making a game-saving play in the NFC Championship game (breaking up an otherwise certain winning touchdown to Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss), Robinson made it to his third consecutive Super Bowl, facing the Broncos for the second straight season.\nThe night prior to Super Bowl XXXIII, Robinson was arrested by an undercover police officer for soliciting a prostitute. Earlier that day, Robinson received the Athletes in Action/Bart Starr Award, given annually to a player who best exemplifies outstanding character and leadership in the home, on the field and in the community. After the arrest, Robinson agreed to return the award.\nThe next day, without much sleep the night before due to the prostitution incident, Robinson gave up an 80-yard touchdown reception to Broncos receiver Rod Smith, giving the Broncos a 17–3 lead over the Falcons. Later, in the fourth quarter, he missed a tackle on Denver running back Terrell Davis that enabled Davis to break a long run to the Atlanta 10-yard line. The Atlanta Falcons ended up losing the game, 34–19, and Robinson was widely denounced by the press and fans for the previous night's incident. The next season was Robinson's last with the Falcons.\nCarolina Panthers.\nAfter leaving the Falcons, Robinson joined the Carolina Panthers, and retired following the 2000 season.\nCareer summary.\nIn his 16 seasons, Robinson recorded 1,415 tackles, 57 interceptions, 762 return yards, 22 fumble recoveries, 71 return yards, and two touchdowns (one fumble return, one interception return), and 7.5 sacks. His 57 interceptions have been exceeded by just 11 players, four of whom are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nCoaching and broadcasting career.\nRobinson served as a color analyst for the Carolina Panthers Radio Network from 2002-18. He is a varsity football and wrestling coach at Charlotte Christian School in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nBeginning in January 2015, Robinson is a co-host of the morning television show \"Charlotte Today\" on WCNC-TV, Charlotte, NC.\nPersonal life.\nRobinson is a Christian and spoke with the Carolina Panthers team before Super Bowl 50."

Park is currently a pro scout for the Minnesota Wild.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Seoul, South Korea, Park moved to Rancho Palos Verdes, California, with his family at age three. As a youth, he played in the 1989 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Los Angeles Kings minor ice hockey team. At age 13, he moved to Ontario and played minor hockey in the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL), and played in the 1990 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Toronto Young Nationals. Park and his brother Horton attended De La Salle College and captained their hockey team. He eventually worked his way up to the Belleville Bulls of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and played for Belleville from 1992–93 to 1995–96.\nFollowing his second OHL season, he was drafted 50th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins during the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He made his NHL debut when he played one regular season game and three Stanley Cup playoff games for Pittsburgh during the 1994–95 season. He became only the second Korean-born person to play in the NHL after Jim Paek. Coincidentally, both of them were drafted by the Penguins. Park played most of the 1995–96 NHL season, appearing in 56 games. He spent the next few years moving between the Anaheim Ducks, Philadelphia Flyers and various International Hockey League (IHL) and American Hockey League (AHL) teams. He played again in the NHL during the 2001–02 season after signing with the Minnesota Wild.\nPark spent three seasons in Minnesota, from 2001–02 to 2003–04, where over the course of several seasons, he achieved career-highs in games played (81), goals scored (14), assists earned (15) and points totalled (25).

        "text": "The British Collegiate American Football League (BCAFL) was an American football league consisting of players from various colleges and universities in the United Kingdom.\nIn 2007 it was succeeded by the British Universities American Football League.\nThe league officially began in the 1985–1986 season with 4 teams, with founder members Newcastle Skolars, led by Mike Rea, and Hull University, and celebrated its 20th anniversary with 37 teams competing the 2005–2006 campaign. The final season was contested by 39 teams, with some teams consisting of players from more than one institution.\nThroughout its existence, BCAFL was plagued by the fact that some of its teams played at a vastly higher skill level than others. During its final years the British Student American Football Association (BSAFA), who was responsible for the operations of BCAFL, made great strides towards competitive balance; increasing the skill level on the field and expanding the game throughout the UK. However, after extended public disagreements with the policies of the governing body of the British American Football Association (BAFA), the BAFA dissolved the BSAFA with all the teams being forced to transfer to the new British university American Football League (BUAFL).\nRules.\nBCAFL largely followed the rules of American college football (though there were restrictions on the number of North American players allowed on the field at any one time). As opposed to the conference and \"bowl game\" set-up used in American college football BCAFL divided itself into two conferences and used a season-ending playoff system, similar to the NFL (however, below the Bowl Subdivision of Division I, the NCAA uses a season-ending playoff system to crown national champions). At the end of an 8-game regular season, 16 teams would advance to the playoffs (the playoffs expanded from 12 to 16 teams in the 2004–2005 season), with the 4 division champions and 4 \"wild card\" teams from each conference participating. The playoffs culminated with a championship game, called the \"College Bowl\" which features the champions of the Northern and Southern Conferences.\nTeams.\nFull Member records.\nTeams are listed within their divisions, with their all-time regular season record listed (records include ONLY official BCAFL regular season games through the 2006–07 season, as recorded in the BCAFL official all-time records).\nAll-star game.\nEach season BCAFL held an All-Star game between the Northern Conference Cougars and the Southern Conference Wildcats. Trials for these All-Star teams are open to all players in the league. Along with the accolades of competing for their conference, All-Star players are also eligible to try out for the Great Britain Bulldogs, a national college team that competes with North American and other European American football national teams."

        "title": "Rugby ball",
        "text": "A rugby ball is an elongated ellipsoidal ball used in both codes of rugby football. Its measurements and weight are specified by World Rugby and the Rugby League International Federation, the governing bodies for both codes, rugby union and rugby league respectively.\nThe rugby ball has an oval shape, four panels and a weight of about 400 grams. It is often confused with some balls of similar dimensions used in American, Canadian and Australian football.\nHistory.\nWilliam Gilbert started making footballs for the neighbouring Rugby School in 1823. The balls had an inner-tube made of a pig's bladder. Both men owned boot and shoe making businesses located close to Rugby school. In 1870, Richard Lindon introduced rubber inner-tubes and because of the pliability of rubber, the shape gradually changed from a sphere to an egg. Lindon and Bernardo Solano started making balls for Rugby School out of hand stitched, leather casings and pigs' bladders. The rugby ball's distinctive shape is supposedly due to the pig's bladder, although early balls were more plum-shape than oval. The balls varied in size in the beginning depending upon how large the pig's bladder was.\nAround 1862, Richard Lindon was desperate to find a replacement for the pig’s bladder and used an India rubber bladder instead. India rubber was too tough to inflate by mouth and so having been inspired by air syringes, he created a large brass air pump to inflate his rugby balls. Lindon also claimed to invent the rugby ball and its distinctive oval shape but didn't patent his design for either the ball, the bladder or the pump. By the 1880s there were several manufacturers of 'footballs' in England all using the same process.\nThe size and shape of the ball was not written into the rules until 1892, when it was determined as follows:\n- Length 11 to 11 1/4 inches\n- Circumference (end on) 30 to 31 inches\n- Circumference (in width) 25 1/2 to 26 inches\n- Weight: 12 to 13 ounces \n- Hand sewn with not less than 8 stitches to the inch\nIn 1892 the RFU endorsed ovalness as the compulsory shape. The gradual flattening of the ball continued over the years.\nThe introduction of synthetic footballs over the traditional leather balls, in both rugby codes, was originally governed by weather conditions. If the playing surface was wet, the synthetic ball was used, as it didn't absorb water and become heavy. Eventually, the leather balls were phased out completely. Polyester is used as backing material to hold the ball's oval shape, along with additional material for grips to enhance performance. The ball is stitched with polyester thread and coated with wax to make it more water-resistant.\nRugby union.\nThe rugby ball used in rugby union is a prolate spheroid essentially elliptical in profile. Modern footballs are manufactured in a variety of colors and patterns. A regulation football is long and in circumference at its widest point. It weighs and is inflated to .\nIn 1980, traditional leather-encased balls, which were prone to water-logging, were replaced with balls encased in synthetic waterproof materials. The Gilbert Synergie was the match ball of the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\nMost of the professional leagues use Adidas, Gilbert, Mitre or Webb Ellis manufactured balls.\nRugby league.\nRugby league is played with a prolate spheroid shaped football which is inflated with nitrogen. A referee will stop play immediately if the ball does not meet the requirements of size and shape. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are synthetic and manufactured in a variety of colours and patterns. Senior competitions should use light coloured balls to allow spectators to see the ball more easily. The football used in rugby league is known as \"international size\" or \"size 5\" and is approximately long and in circumference at its widest point. Smaller-sized balls are used for junior versions of the game, such as \"Mini\" and \"Mod\". A full size ball weighs between . Rugby league footballs are slightly more pointed than rugby union footballs and larger than American footballs.\nBoth the Australian National Rugby League and the Super League use balls made by Steeden. Steeden is also sometimes used as a noun to describe the ball itself."

        "title": "Undisputed championship (boxing)",
        "text": "In boxing, the undisputed champion of a weight class is the boxer who simultaneously holds world titles from all recognized major organisations by each other and the International Boxing Hall of Fame. There are currently four major sanctioning bodies: WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO. There were many undisputed champions before the number of major sanctioning bodies recognizing each other increased to four in 2007, but there have only been 19 boxers (9 males and 10 females) to hold all four titles simultaneously.\nHistory.\nPrior to the 1960s, most champions were \"undisputed\", although the term was rarely used (it does not appear in one 1970 \"Boxing Dictionary\"). Early boxing champions at various weight divisions were established by acclamation between 1880 and 1920. Once a consensus champion had been awarded the title, the championship could usually be taken only by beating the reigning holder, establishing a lineal championship.\nThe New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) recognized champions from its foundation in 1920. The National Boxing Association (NBA) was founded by other U.S. state bodies in 1921, and began recognising champions in 1927. Until the 1960s, both usually recognised the same lineal champion. However, disputes could arise if the champion retired or moved to a different weight class. Occasionally, the International Boxing Union (renamed the European Boxing Union in 1946) recognised a different champion. The disputes were usually short-lived as a lucrative fight would be organised between the rival champions. The longest split was ten years, of the middleweight title, between Mickey Walker's move up to heavyweight in 1931 and NBA champion Tony Zale's defeat of NYSAC contender Georgie Abrams in 1941. An early use of \"undisputed\" appears in a \"New York Times\" preview of the 1941 fight.\nThe growing popularity of boxing outside of the U.S. led to creation of various boxing organizations, each strengthening their influence (most notably BBBofC) and having their own champion. This resulted in a growing number of boxers claiming to be legitimate champions. The disruption in boxing was solved after World War II when the \"World Championship Committee\" (WCC) was created with NBA as its unanimous authority. The committee, however, was disbanded in 1955 when NBA, along with its new members (which included the Orient, Mexican and South American federations and boxing commissions of the Philippines and Thailand) left WCC citing lack of control over the organisation. The NBA's voting scheme guaranteed one vote for each state commission as well as one vote for each foreign country. On August 23, 1962, the NBA officially became the World Boxing Association and moved their headquarters to Panama City, Panama.\nA year later NYSAC along with European Boxing Union and BBBofC supported creation of the World Boxing Council. WBC was officially established on February 14, 1963, in Mexico City, Mexico by 11 countries (the U.S., Argentina, U.K., France, Mexico, Philippines, Panama, Chile, Peru, Venezuela and Brazil) that were invited by the President of Mexico Adolfo López Mateos to form an international organization to unify all commissions of the world to control the expansion of boxing. The reason for the move were concerns about WBA's alleged lack of desire to support professional boxing outside of the U.S..\nIn April 1983, members of United States Boxing Association along with Robert W. Lee (a former WBA vice-president) voted to expand the organisation and form the USBA-International. The organization later changed the name to International Boxing Federation. The inaugural IBF heavyweight champion was Larry Holmes, who relinquished the WBC title to accept IBF's recognition, thus helping the newly formed organization to establish its legitimacy. The fragmentation of titles was thus increased. After some negotiations, the heavyweight title was unified in the heavyweight unification series, a series of coordinated bouts in 1986 and 1987, with Mike Tyson emerging as the first undisputed champion (WBA, WBC, and IBF) since Leon Spinks in 1978. The title was split again in 1992 when Riddick Bowe forfeited the WBC title.\nAnother major sanctioning body, the World Boxing Organization, was established in 1988 in San Juan, Puerto Rico by a group of local businessmen. At the beginnings, when most of the challengers for WBA, WBC, and IBF titles were Americans, WBO had a wider variety of countries, mainly European, represented in title bouts. Before the Klitschko Era, the United Kingdom tied the United States for most wins in WBO heavyweight title fights with eight. In 1997, WBO titlist Naseem Hamed was allowed to unify titles for the first time in WBO history; on February 8, he defeated Tom Johnson to become unified WBO and IBF featherweight champion. By 2001, the WBA was giving the same recognition to WBO champions as to WBA, WBC, and IBF champions. In 2004, the WBC began naming WBO champions on its ranking listings. The IBF did not recognise the WBO in May 2006, but was doing so by February 2007. Conversely, the WBO has been explicitly recognizing the other three sanctioning bodies since at least October 1, 2008.\nUntil at least 2008, many considered it sufficient to hold the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles. Other bodies such as the IBO, IBU, and World Boxing Foundation are disregarded.\nFour title undisputed champions.\nOnly 9 men have held all four versions of the belts at the same time, two of which have been the only male boxers to have done so in two divisions. \nOnly 10 women have held all four versions of the belts at the same time, two have done so in two divisions. \nAs of January 2024, there have been 40 fights with all four belts on the line.\nDisputed undisputed champions.\nIf a fighter wins all the titles but is stripped by one organization of its title, he may continue to be considered the undisputed champion.\nRoy Jones Jr. was called the undisputed light heavyweight champion after unifying the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles in June 1999. He was later awarded \"The Ring\" championship title. However, two of those titles (WBA and IBF) had been stripped from Dariusz Michalczewski, who had unified them with his WBO title by beating the lineal champion Virgil Hill in June 1997 and subsequently remained unbeaten, defending his remaining title, until his first loss in October 2003. Speaking of Jones' claim to being undisputed champion, one writer opined that the distinction \"could just as easily belong to current WBO titleist Dariusz Michalczewski.\"\nFive months after Lennox Lewis unified the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles to become the undisputed heavyweight champion, a U.S. Federal Judge ruled that Lewis would be stripped by the WBA of their world championship belt for fighting Michael Grant instead of the association's #1 contender, John Ruiz. The fight took place on April 29, 2000. Lewis remained a unified world champion until April 22, 2001, when he was defeated by Hasim Rahman. He regained the WBC and IBF titles following victory over Rahman seven months later in a rematch. His reign as a unified world champion ended in September 2002, when he rejected the chance to fight the IBF's #1 contender, Chris Byrd, and was therefore stripped by the organisation of their belt. He retained his WBC title until his retirement in February 2004.\nJermain Taylor won all four middleweight titles from Bernard Hopkins in July 2005, but was stripped of the IBF title for agreeing to a rematch rather than fighting Sam Soliman. Nevertheless, he was still described as \"undisputed champion\" by some reports.\nAfter Joe Calzaghe's super middleweight victory over Mikkel Kessler in November 2007, he was frequently described as \"undisputed champion\". Others disputed this, because although he held the WBA, WBC, and WBO titles, he had vacated his IBF title in November 2006 for choosing to face Peter Manfredo Jr. as his next opponent instead of mandatory challenger Robert Stieglitz.\nTeófimo López won the WBC Franchise lightweight title in addition to the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and \"The Ring\" magazine titles after beating Vasiliy Lomachenko in October 2020, and was subsequently reported by some media outlets to be the youngest four-belt undisputed champion of all-time at the age of 23 years old; however, the WBC Franchise title is not universally recognized as a major world title.\nUnified championship.\nThe unified champion is defined as a boxer that holds at least two world championships of major sanctioning bodies (WBA, WBC, IBF or WBO) in their respective division. Around 2004, the World Boxing Association recognized three different types: the unified champion (two-titles holder in the weight division or category, obliged to defend the title against WBA's No. 1 contender in 18 months periodically), the undisputed champion (three-titles holder, mandatory defense against WBA's challenger in 21 months regularly) and the super champion (four-titles holder, WBA's mandatory defense in 24 months periodically). The rules required only one unified/undisputed/super champion per weight class and the purse in the bid would be distributed in a 65/35 ratio in favor of the unified champion. However, along with the changes to \"super\" status (besides holding more than one title, the super titles were awarded to champions that were able to defend the WBA title 5 times), the term \"undisputed\" was dropped completely.\nCurrent unified champions.\nKeys:\nMost wins in unified championship bouts.\nKeys:\nMost consecutive defenses of unified title.\nKeys:\nUnification series.\nTournaments have been arranged to unify the titles in a weight class."

        "title": "Bob Quinn (baseball, born 1870)",
        "text": "James Aloysius Robert Quinn (February 14, 1870 – March 12, 1954), often referred to as J. A. Robert Quinn, was an American executive in Major League Baseball who became renowned for his management of four different franchises.\nCareer.\nBorn in Columbus, Ohio, Quinn was a catcher in minor league baseball during the 1890s, also managing some of the teams for which he played. From 1902 to 1917, he served as general manager of the Columbus Senators in the American Association; he was also among the founders of that league. In 1908, he founded and was president of the Ohio State League, a Class D minor league (equivalent to a Rookie-level league today) which began operation as a six team league with teams located in Central/Southern Ohio. He became general manager of the St. Louis Browns from 1917 to 1922, developing the perennially poor team into one which lost the 1922 American League pennant by a single game.\nIn the summer of 1923, fresh off that success, Quinn put together a syndicate that purchased the Boston Red Sox from Harry Frazee. The purchase was financed by four investors who knew him from his days in Columbus, with the largest contribution coming from glass magnate Palmer Winslow. The investors trusted Quinn enough to make him president and operating head of the franchise. Quinn had every intention of rebuilding a team that had been rendered bereft of talent after Frazee's chronic cash shorts forced him to sell nearly every talented player to the New York Yankees. To that end, he spent $250,000 on minor league stars However, in a case of exceptionally bad timing, Winslow fell ill in 1924 and largely withdrew from financing the team. He died in 1926, and the three surviving members of Quinn's syndicate didn't have nearly enough money between them to make up for the loss of Winslow's investment. \nFor the remainder of Quinn's tenure as owner of the Red Sox, the team was severely underfinanced. The team lost over $200,000 from 1924 to 1929. This led to a vicious circle in which lack of talent on the field sent attendance through the floor, thus denying Quinn money that could have been used to acquire more players or retain the few good players he had. As a result, Quinn's tenure as owner was, statistically speaking, the darkest in franchise history. With rosters made up mostly of castoffs from other AL teams, they finished dead last in the American League eight times during Quinn's ten years as owner, only rising as high as sixth twice. They finally bottomed out in 1932, with a record that is still the worst in franchise history. \nBy the 1932–33 offseason, Quinn knew he was at the end of his tether. He needed to borrow against his life insurance just to send the team to spring training. Realizing that there was no way he could operate the Red Sox in 1933, he began searching for a buyer. He found his white knight in lumber magnate Tom Yawkey, who had been looking to buy a baseball team as soon as he turned 30 and gained full access to money in a trust fund set up for him by his uncle and adoptive father, former Detroit Tigers owner Bill Yawkey. Former baseball great Eddie Collins, who had attended the same prep school as Yawkey, set up a meeting between Yawkey and Collins during the 1932 World Series. The $1.5 million deal closed just before the start of 1933 spring training, and just days after Yawkey turned 30. Supposedly, the $1.5 million from the sale of the team was only enough for Quinn to pay off all of his debts from his owning the Red Sox, with no money left over for himself. Quinn later said that once the team was sold, \"I was broke and out of a job, but I was free of debt. I breathed a sigh of relief when it was all over.\"\nQuinn then became general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers for two seasons (1934–1935) before joining the Boston Braves as team president and part owner from 1936 to 1945. After his 1945 retirement, he briefly served as a sporting goods executive, and then became president of the Baseball Hall of Fame from 1948 to 1951, leaving that position after suffering two strokes.\nPatriarch of baseball family.\nQuinn died at age 84 in Providence, Rhode Island, and was buried near Columbus. His son John J. Quinn took over as the general manager of the Braves following his father's retirement, continuing after the team moved to Milwaukee in 1953, and later served as GM of the Philadelphia Phillies. His grandson Bob Quinn was the general manager of the New York Yankees, Cincinnati Reds, and San Francisco Giants between 1988 and 1996, and his grandson Jack Quinn served as general manager of the St. Louis Blues franchise in the National Hockey League. His great-grandson Bob Quinn (born 1968) is the former executive vice president, finance and administration, and chief financial officer of the Milwaukee Brewers."

        "text": "Randolph Smith (December 12, 1948 – June 4, 2009) was an American professional basketball player who set the NBA record for consecutive games played. From 1972 to 1982, Smith played in every regular season game, en route to a then-record of 906 straight games (since broken by A.C. Green). In college, he was a Division II All-American basketball player, soccer player and track athlete. He was born in Bellport, New York.\nEarly life.\nRandolph Smith was born on December 12, 1948, in Bellport, New York. He attended Bellport High School in Brookhaven, New York, where he excelled in basketball.\nCollege career.\nSmith was an outstanding all-around athlete at Buffalo State College, earning All-American honors in three sports: basketball, soccer and track. At Bellport High School on Long Island, Smith was a standout on the soccer and basketball teams, and also set a state high jump record of . However, it was on the basketball court that Smith shone brightest, teaming with Durie Burns to lead the Bengals to three straight conference championships, including a trip to the Final Four of the NCAA Division II Tournament in 1970, where Smith earned All-Tournament honors.\nProfessional career.\nBuffalo Braves / San Diego Clippers (1971–1979).\nSmith surprised everyone in training camp, and he made the final roster cuts. Despite standing only 6-foot-3, he was assigned to play forward. He averaged 13.4 points per game in his rookie season. Smith continued to improve beyond expectation, drawing on his tremendous speed, quickness and leaping ability. His style of play, along with contemporaries like Julius Erving, marked by fast breaks and \"above the rim\" ball movements influenced the offensive style of the NBA in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Playing alongside league scoring champion Bob McAdoo, Smith averaged 21.8 points per game in the 1975–76 season, and was named to the All-NBA Second Team.\nThe highlight of Smith's career was the 1978 NBA All-Star Game, where he came off the bench to lead all scorers with 27 points, and was named the game's Most Valuable Player.\nSmith played for seven years for the Braves until the franchise became the in 1978. That first year with the Clippers, Smith had his fourth consecutive season averaging over 20 points per game.\nCleveland Cavaliers (1979–1981).\nIn 1979, Smith was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he was named team captain and played for two years.\nNew York Knicks (1981–1982).\nSmith spent the 1981 season with the New York Knicks.\nReturn to San Diego (1982–1983).\nThe next season, Smith moved back to San Diego for another season.\nOn November 3, 1982, Smith played in his 845th consecutive NBA game, breaking Johnny Kerr's iron man record. The game was a 130–111 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers in which Smith started and scored 14 points. Smith's iron man streak ended at 906 games when he played his last game with the Clippers on March 13, 1983. He had requested to be waived to play for a contender late in the 1982–83 NBA season and he missed a game while waiting to clear waivers. The record was later surpassed by A.C. Green in 1997.\nAtlanta Hawks (1983).\nSmith was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, where he played 15 games before retiring.\nNASL.\nIn early 1975 at age 26, while nearing the height of his basketball career, Smith turned many heads at a tryout for the expansion Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League. The Rowdies' management had hoped to sign the two-time college soccer All-American for the outdoor season as one of their \"required\" American players; however, his contract with the Braves would not allow him to play professional soccer at the time. A year later while in between basketball contracts, the Rowdies gave him another look, but it wasn't meant to be. After a third and final tryout in 1977, Rowdies coach Eddie Firmani felt that the combination of playing pro basketball and not playing any soccer for so long had diminished Smith's soccer skills too much.\nExecutive and coaching career.\nAfter retiring as a player, Smith was an NBA league executive whose duties included assisting former players in need, and he was a coach in the Continental Basketball Association before working at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, where he worked in marketing.\nPost-playing career.\nSmith was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Basketball Category with the Class of 1990. He was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1992.\nOn June 4, 2009, Smith died in Norwich, Connecticut, after a heart attack during a workout. He's buried at the Forest Lawn East Cemetery, Weddington, NC."

The team was equally successful at the next edition. Then they did not win another medal again until the 1997 tournament. They surprisingly won the silver medal after defeating Luxembourg in the semifinals, and losing to Cyprus in the final.\nIn 2001 and 2003, Malta joined the qualifying stages of the EuroBasket for the 2003 and 2005 editions respectively. However, they failed to qualify for both tournaments, as the team finished with six losses in six games played each time.\nMalta also participated in all the editions of the European Championship for Small Countries, but did not win any medal until 2010, when they beat Moldova for bronze. In 2012, they won the bronze again and in 2014, Malta lost to Andorra in the final 66–63 to take home silver.\nOn 1 July 2018, Malta won their first official title after beating Norway, by the score of 75–59 in the final of the 2018 European Championship for Small Countries.

        "title": "Sweep (American football)",
        "text": "A sweep is an outside running play in American football where a running back takes a pitch or handoff from the quarterback and starts running parallel to the line of scrimmage, allowing for the offensive linemen and fullback to get in front of him to block defenders before he turns upfield. The play is run farther outside than an off tackle play. Variants of the sweep involve the quarterback or a wide receiver running with the ball, rather than a running back. When a wide receiver runs with the ball, it is known as a jet sweep.\nTypes of the sweep.\nToss sweep.\nA toss sweep is a play that is usually run out of the I formation or single set back formation. In recent years, it has also been run out of the pistol formation. The quarterback takes the snap, reverses out, then tosses the ball to the tailback. When run from the I formation, it allows the fullback to pick up any defenders who have penetrated into the backfield. Blocking from the offensive line ranges from straight zone blocking to pulling the playside guard. While this sweep doesn't have as many playfake combinations as the buck sweep, it tends to be more powerful and allows the running back to turn upfield faster.\nBuck sweep.\nThe buck sweep is usually run from a Wing T formation that includes a variety of play fakes. The quarterback takes the snap and fakes trap to the fullback. He then hands off to a halfback or wingback, who runs to the outside. The buck sweep is normally blocked by pulling the playside guard to kickout the force defender, and the backside guard pulling and turning up on the playsided linebacker. This allows for the other linemen to downblock on the other defenders, giving the offense an advantage when it comes to blocking angles. The buck sweep also provides an advantage in the possibilities available from its action, with the fullback trap before the sweep, a \"waggle\" pass, or bootleg after it, and the sweep itself.\nPackers sweep.\nVince Lombardi, head coach of the Green Bay Packers, was fond of the sweep. In the 1960s, he utilized the Packers sweep play—also known as the Lombardi sweep—in which guards Jerry Kramer and Fuzzy Thurston rapidly pulled out from their normal positions and led blocking for the running back (typically Paul Hornung or Jim Taylor) going around the end. It was an integral part of an offense that won five NFL titles in seven years.\nFlanker sweep.\nAlso known as the jet sweep or fly sweep, this sweep is a running play that is run from a set with a wide receiver (flanker) split out to the side away from the play, often run with the receiver in motion. The quarterback receives the snap and turns or runs toward the receiver, as the receiver makes a deep arc into the backfield behind the quarterback, where there is an exchange either by handoff or by pitching the ball to the receiver. This play typically resembles Student Body Right, in that every available blocker blocks to the playside. The variant that became popular in the National Football League (NFL) in 2018 is often run with the quarterback in a shotgun formation and the receiver crossing in front of him to receive the ball; when run in this manner using a pitch, the pitch is considered a forward pass, resulting in an incomplete pass rather than a fumble if the ball is dropped.\nQuarterback sweep.\nThe quarterback sweep is a running play where the quarterback takes the snap from center, typically in a shotgun formation, and then runs to the outside. This play can best be run by a fast, athletic quarterback. Sweeps often involve pulling of offensive linemen, usually one or both guards, to provide extra blockers at the point of attack. Teams such as the Arkansas Razorbacks have had success running this play by lining up the halfback as the quarterback in a wildcat formation."

        "text": "Chris Palmer (born September 23, 1949) is an American former football coach and college athletics administrator. Palmer served as the head coach for Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) from 1999 to 2000 and in the same capacity with the Hartford Colonials of the United Football League (UFL) in 2010. He was the head football coach at the University of New Haven from 1986 to 1987 and at Boston University from 1988 to 1989. Palmer has also served as an assistant coach with the Dallas Cowboys, Houston Texans, Jacksonville Jaguars, New England Patriots, New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers, Houston Oilers, Tennessee Titans and the Buffalo Bills of the NFL. He later returned to the University of New Haven and served as the athletic director from 2018 to 2019.\nHigh school and college.\nPalmer played high school football at Immaculate High School a small Catholic high school located in Danbury, Connecticut. After high school, he attended and played college football at Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU). Palmer played quarterback for Southern Connecticut State from 1968 to 1971. He earned both bachelor's and master's degrees at SCSU, where he was inducted into the school's athletic Hall of Fame. He is also a member of the Hall of Fame at New Haven and Immaculate High School.\nAfter graduation from Southern Connecticut State University, Palmer coached under Larry Naviaux at the University of Connecticut. While at Connecticut, Palmer also devoted his time to help develop sports talent, as quoted by Jeff Naviaux \"Chris helped me learn the importance of a team\". Palmer coached the freshman defensive line in 1972 and the varsity wide receivers in 1973 and 1974. In 1975, he became the wide receivers coach at Lehigh University. The following year, Palmer was named the offensive coordinator at Colgate University, where he stayed for seven years. In 1977, the Red Raiders led the nation in total offense with an average of 486 yards a game.\nPrior to entering the NFL, Palmer was a college football coach. He was the head coach at Boston University in 1988 and 1989 and at the University of New Haven in 1986 and 1987, when the Chargers posted consecutive 8–2 records.\nProfessional.\nInitial professional coaching experience.\nPalmer's first professional coaching experience came in 1983, when he was the offensive line coach for the Montreal Concordes in the Canadian Football League. The following year, he coached the wide receivers for the USFL's New Jersey Generals. In 1985, he was promoted to quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator. That year, Palmer's offense featured quarterback Doug Flutie and running back Herschel Walker, who rushed for 2,411 yards.\nHouston Oilers.\nPalmer's first NFL coaching experience was as the Houston Oilers wide receivers coach from 1990 to 1992 when Kevin Gilbride was the Houston offensive coordinator. During those three seasons, the Run ‘N Shoot Oilers had the NFL's most productive passing attack. Four Houston wide receivers—Curtis Duncan, Ernest Givens (twice), Drew Hill and Haywood Jeffires (twice)—made the Pro Bowl while being coached by Palmer.\nNew England Patriots.\nPalmer first worked under Bill Parcells as the New England Patriots wide receivers coach from 1993 to 1995. In 1996, he became the quarterbacks coach, where he worked with Drew Bledsoe as they advanced to Super Bowl XXXI.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nFollowing Super Bowl XXXI, he joined the Jacksonville Jaguars, spending the 1997–98 seasons as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks under head coach Tom Coughlin.\nCleveland Browns.\nPalmer became the head coach of the reborn Cleveland Browns for the 1999–2000 seasons, the first two for the \"new\" Browns after the original team had moved to Baltimore. Palmer struggled to make the team competitive, especially on offense. Palmer was fired after posting a 5–27 record in two seasons, and was succeeded by former University of Miami coach Butch Davis. During his tenure in Cleveland, he starred as himself on an episode of The Drew Carey Show, which took place in Cleveland.\nHouston Texans.\nIn 2002, he became the offensive coordinator of the expansion Houston Texans under head coach Dom Capers. He remained with Houston until he was fired in Week 2 of the 2005 NFL season as a result of Houston's lackluster offense and would not be retained under new head coach Gary Kubiak.\nDallas Cowboys.\nIn January 2006, several months after his firing from Houston, Palmer was hired by the Dallas Cowboys to be the quarterbacks coach. He was reunited with head coach Bill Parcells and quarterback Drew Bledsoe with whom he had worked during his days with the New England Patriots.\nNew York Giants.\nIn January 2007, Palmer was hired by the New York Giants as their new quarterbacks coach, reuniting with the team's head coach, Tom Coughlin, with whom he had worked in Jacksonville. In Palmer's first year with the Giants, they would go on to win Super Bowl XLII, defeating the previously undefeated New England Patriots by a score of 17-14. Palmer coached quarterbacks Eli Manning, Jared Lorenzen, Anthony Wright, David Carr, and Rhett Bomar in his 3 seasons as quarterbacks coach.\nOn January 29, 2010 Palmer announced his retirement.\nHartford Colonials.\nFollowing his retirement from the NFL, Palmer was named as the head coach and general manager of the United Football League's Hartford Colonials.\nTennessee Titans.\nOn February 15, 2011, the Tennessee Titans named Palmer as the new offensive coordinator, which was previously held by Mike Heimerdinger. Under Palmer during the 2011 season the Titans scored 325 points (20.3/g), 21st of 32 in the NFL. On November 26, 2012, Palmer was fired by the team midway through the season, and replaced by quarterbacks coach Dowell Loggains.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nDuring the 2014 season, the San Francisco 49ers hired Palmer as an offensive assistant under head coach Jim Harbaugh. 2014 was the inaugural season playing their home games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. At the end of the season, Harbaugh left the Niners to become the head coach at his alma mater, the University of Michigan, and had released Greg Roman, the offensive coordinator, and ultimately Palmer as well.\nBuffalo Bills.\nPalmer followed Roman to Buffalo, served as an offensive assistant on Rex Ryan's staff from 2015 to 2016. He was not retained under new head coach Sean McDermott.\nReturn to college athletics.\nPalmer returned to New Haven to serve as the director of athletics and recreation for the Chargers' NCAA Division II athletics program in January 2018. He retired in June 2019.\nHe was inducted into the New Haven Chargers Athletics Hall of Fame in 1997 for his previous success as the school's head football coach."

        "text": "The Spain men's national basketball team () represents Spain in international basketball competitions. They are managed by the Spanish Basketball Federation, the governing body for basketball in Spain. Spain is the current European champion.\nSpain has appeared 32 times at the EuroBasket, winning four gold medals, six silver medals, and four bronze medals. They have also competed at the Summer Olympics 13 times, with three silver medals and one bronze medal as their accomplishments. They have qualified for the FIBA World Cup 13 times, winning it twice, in 2006 and 2019.\nSpain is currently ranked second in the FIBA World Ranking.\nHistory.\nOlympic Games.\nWhen Spain qualified for the 1936 Summer Olympics, where basketball was part of the games for the first time, expectations were high for the runners-up of the 1935 EuroBasket. Unfortunately, as one of the favorites to win medals, Spain could not attend the Games due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War just days before the start of the event.\nSpain's first Olympic success came at the 1984 Summer Olympics. The team made it all the way to the gold medal game, before losing to the United States (led by Patrick Ewing and featuring a young Michael Jordan).\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics, Spain reached the gold medal game for the second time. However, in a rematch of the 1984 Olympic final, Spain fell to the United States once more. This time led by Kobe Bryant and nicknamed the \"Redeem Team\". The Americans won after a remarkably close game 118–107. Four years later, at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the United States faced Spain in the Olympic final for the third time. The USA would go on to win gold again, by the score of 107–100, with Spain coming away with its third Olympic (and second straight) silver medal. During the 2016 Summer Olympics, Spain reached the bronze medal match against Australia, where they escaped with an narrow 89–88 victory.\nFIBA World Cup.\nDuring the early years of the FIBA World Cup, Spain struggled to establish a steady presence as a competitor. Between 1950 and 1970, the national team only qualified once. Then, beginning in 1974, Spain developed into a serious competitor and regularly finished among the World Cup top performers in the competitions to follow.\nAt the 2006 FIBA World Cup, Spain achieved their greatest success in its history, as they defeated Greece in the final to capture their first World Cup title. Held at the Saitama Super Arena in Japan, the game ended by the final score of 70–47. Furthermore, Pau Gasol was named the tournament MVP, while Jorge Garbajosa was selected to the All-Tournament team. Shortly afterwards, the team were awarded with the 2006 Prince of Asturias Award in Sports.\nAt the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Spain won their second World Cup title by defeating Argentina in the final by the score of 95–75. The spectacular play of Ricky Rubio during the tournament earned him the MVP, while Marc Gasol was named to the All-Tournament team. After this victory, Marc Gasol became the second player in tournament history to win the NBA title and the World Cup in the same year; with the other being Lamar Odom.\nEuroBasket.\nThe first game in the history of the selection was a qualifier for the EuroBasket 1935, where Spain defeated Portugal 33–12. This event, which was held in Geneva in the summer of 1935, was the first EuroBasket game in history. Spain went on to finish as runners-up in the tournament behind Latvia.\nAfter coming in second in 1935, 1973, 1983, 1999, 2003, and 2007, Spain won their first continental championship in 2009; defeating Serbia to become European champions. The team repeated their success in 2011, taking out France in the final. At EuroBasket 2015, Spain once again reached the title game, and demolished Lithuania in the process 80–63. Two years after winning it all in 2015, Spain followed it up with another strong performance at EuroBasket 2017, defeating Russia to win the bronze medal match. It marked the fourth time Spain won bronze at the EuroBasket, as they also won it in 1991, 2001, and 2013.\nSpain captured their fourth European title at the EuroBasket 2022, after defeating France in the final once again, a rematch of the 2011 title game. Additionally, center Willy Hernangómez was selected as tournament MVP.\nOther events.\nBesides success at the \"Big Three\" events (Summer Olympic Games, FIBA World Cup, and EuroBasket) Spain has also

        "title": "Czechoslovakia men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Czechoslovakia national basketball team (, ) represented Czechoslovakia in international basketball from 1932 to 1992. After the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia set up their own national teams. Both teams are recognized as the successor to the Czechoslovak team.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 1935.\nThe Czechoslovak side came in third place at the first European basketball championship, the EuroBasket 1935 held by the International Basketball Federation's FIBA Europe continental federation. They defeated France in the preliminary round to advance to the semifinals. There they lost to Spain, resulting in a playoff for third place with Switzerland which the Czechoslovaks won 25–23.\nEuroBasket 1937.\nIn the EuroBasket 1937 competition, the Czechoslovaks finished seventh of eight teams. Their preliminary group included the powerful French, Polish, and Latvian teams, each of which defeated Czechoslovakia in the preliminary round. The Czechoslovaks then faced Estonia in the classification semifinals, losing again. Their final match was against Egypt in the 7th/8th playoff; since Egypt had withdrawn during preliminary play, Czechoslovakia received their only win by default.\nEuroBasket 1946.\nCzechoslovakia returned to European competition with EuroBasket 1946. They started off well in a tournament notably lacking the Baltic countries that had dominated the pre-war competitions. Defeating Switzerland and then Belgium, the Czechoslovak team placed first in the preliminary round group of three. They moved on to the semifinal round, facing the Hungarians. A 42–28 win secured a place in the championship game for Czechoslovakia. In that game, they played the undefeated Italy. After training 18–21 at halftime, Czechoslovakia came back to win the game 34–32 to win their first European championship.\nEuroBasket 1947.\nDefending champions and tournament hosts Czechoslovakia started off well again at EuroBasket 1947, winning all three of their preliminary round matches and then all three of their semifinal round matches. This put them in their first match up against the Soviet Union in the championship game. In the first of five championship game matches between the European titans, Czechoslovakia lost 56–37 to finish with a silver medal.\nEuroBasket 1951.\nCzechoslovakia did not compete at EuroBasket 1949 in Cairo, returning to the European championships at EuroBasket 1951 in Paris. They endured some hardship in the tournament, losing to Belgium in the preliminary round to finish the round 2–1 and second-ranked of the four teams in the pool. This was sufficient to advance to the semifinal round, however. There, they faced the dominant Soviet Union, losing their second game of the tournament and again finishing second of four in the pool with a 2–1 record. This put them in a match up against the first-ranked team from the opposite pool, hosts France. Czechoslovakia won 59–50, advancing to the final, a rematch against the Soviets.\nIn what was by far the closest game the Soviets had yet endured in European play, Czechoslovakia managed to bring the game to a 44–44 tie with 1 second remaining to play before fouling Ilmar Kullam and sending him to the free throw line to attempt a free throw. Kullam made the shot, but one of the referees gave an initial signal that he had stepped on the line during the attempt and that therefore the shot did not count. Consultation with another referee eventually resulted in the point being allowed, and Czechoslovakia lost its second championship game to the Soviet Union 45–44.\nEuroBasket 1953.\nAfter placing in the top two in each of their last three appearances, the fourth-place finish that Czechoslovakia earned at EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow was somewhat of a disappointment. However, the difference between 2nd and 5th in 1953 was a 4-way tie-breaker, in which the Czechoslovakia squad had gotten the third spot for fourth place overall.\nThe preliminary round posed little difficulty, with Czechoslovakia winning all three games. The final round, however, saw Czechoslovakia lose close matches to Israel and Yugoslavia, as well as the Soviet squad, on their way to a 4–3 record in the final round. This put Czechoslovakia on an equal footing with Hungary, France national basketball team, and Italy in a tie for second behind the Soviets. Despite Czechoslovakia having beaten Hungary and France, both teams came about above Czechoslovakia in the final standings, while Israel was dropped to fifth place.\nEuroBasket 1955.\nIn Budapest for the EuroBasket 1955 competition, the Czechoslovakia team found itself slaying giants but falling to less vaunted opponents. They had little difficulty in the preliminary round, going 3–0 to advance to the final pool. There, Czechoslovakia defeated powerful Hungary, in Hungary's only loss of the final round on their way to the gold medal, but also gave Yugoslavia the only win the Yugoslavian team would get in the final round as Czechoslovakia fell 52–49 to the eventual 8th-place finishers. A third-round loss to Poland made the round robin look bleak for the Czechoslovak team, as they were already down to 1–2 and had yet to face the Soviet Union, which had yet to lose a game in 4 tournaments and 31 matches.\nNevertheless, Czechoslovakia defeated the Soviets 81–74 in a surprising match. They then won their next three games, finishing in second place with the silver medal and a 5–2, edging out the Soviets who were also 5–2 after losing to Hungary in their sixth match. Czechoslovakia had managed to defeat both the gold medallists and bronze medallists, meanwhile losing to teams that finished 5th and 8th.\nEuroBasket 1957.\nSofia was the location of Czechoslovakia's next European tournament entry, EuroBasket 1957. They had little difficulty in the preliminary round, winning each of their three games by 18 points or more. In the final round, Czechoslovakia met with Bulgaria and Soviet Union in the second and third matches of the 7-game round robin, losing those two to drop to an early 1–2 record. However, none of the other teams in the final round could match the Czechoslovakia squad, and the team finished at 5–2 with a bronze medal behind the Bulgarians and Soviets. Czechoslovak player Jiří Baumruk was named MVP.\nStatistics.\nTop career caps.\nPlayers with the most caps (total games played):\nTop 20 career scorers.\nIncludes total points scored in only games played at the FIBA Pre-Olympic Tournament, the FIBA European Olympic Qualifying Tournament, the Summer Olympics, the FIBA World Cup, and the FIBA EuroBasket.\nRosters.\n1935 FIBA EuroBasket: finished 3rd among 10 teams\nJiří Čtyřoký, Jan Feřtek, Josef Franc, Josef Klíma, Josef Moc, František Picek, Václav Voves\n1936 Summer Olympic Games: finished 11th among 21 teams\nJiří Čtyřoký, Josef Klíma, František Picek, Josef Moc, Karel Kuhn, Ladislav Prokop, Ladislav Trpkoš, Hubert Prokop\n1937 FIBA EuroBasket: finished 7th among 8 teams\nJan Kozák, Josef Klíma, Ladislav Prokop, Josef Bartoníček, Ludvík Dvořáček, Silverius Labohý, Zdeněk Scholler, Bertan Štorkán (Head coach: František Marek)\n1939 FIBA EuroBasket: did not participate\n1946 FIBA EuroBasket: finished 1st among 10 teams\nIvan Mrázek, Gustáv Hermann, Miloš Bobocký, Jiří Drvota, Josef Ezr, Ján Hluchý, Josef Křepela, Pavel Nerad, Ladislav Šimáček, František Stibitz, Josef Toms, Ladislav Trpkoš, Emil Velenský, Miroslav Vondráček (Head coach: František Hájek)\n1947 FIBA EuroBasket: finished 2nd among 14 teams\nIvan Mrázek, Jiří Drvota, Gustáv Hermann, Miloš Bobocký, Jan Kozák, Josef Ezr, Karel Bělohradský, Miroslav Dostál, Milan Fráňa, Václav Krása, Josef Toms, Ladislav Trpkoš, Emil Velenský, Miroslav Vondráček (Head coach: Josef Fleischlinger)\n1948 Summer Olympic Games: finished 7th among 23 teams\nIvan Mrázek, Jan Kozák, Josef Ezr, Jiří Drvota, Karel Bělohradský, Ctirad Benáček, Zdeněk Chlup, Jozef Kalina, Václav Krása, Zoltán Krenický, Josef Křepela, Jiří Siegel, Josef Toms, Ladislav Trpkoš\n1949 FIBA EuroBasket: did not participate\n1950 FIBA World Championship: did not participate\n1951 FIBA EuroBasket: finished 2nd among 17 teams\nIvan Mrázek, Miroslav Škeřík, Jiří Baumruk, Jaroslav Šíp, Zdeněk Bobrovský, Jan Kozák, Zdeněk Rylich, Miroslav Baumruk, Zoltán Krenický, Karel Belohradsky, Jindřich Kinský, Jiří Matoušek, Miloš Nebuchla, Arnošt Novák, Karel Sobota, Stanislav Vykydal (Head coach: Josef Andrle)\n1952 Summer Olympic Games: finished 10th among 23 teams\nIvan Mrázek, Miroslav Škeřík, Jiří Baumruk, Jaroslav Šíp, Zdeněk Bobrovský, Jan Kozák, Zdeněk Rylich, Miroslav Baumruk, Jiří Matoušek, Eugen Horniak, Jaroslav Tetiva, Josef Ezr, Lubomír Kolář, Miloslav Kodl\n1953 FIBA EuroBasket: finished 4th among 17 teams\nIvan Mrázek, Jiří Baumruk, Zdeněk Bobrovský, Jan Kozák, Miroslav Škeřík, Zdeněk Rylich, Radoslav Šíp, Jaroslav Tetiva, Jaroslav Šíp, Jindřich Kinský, Eugen Horniak, Rudolf Stanček, Lubomir Kolář (Head coach: Lubomír Dobrý)\n1954 FIBA World Championship: did not participate\n1955 FIBA EuroBasket: finished 2nd among 18 teams\nIvan Mrázek, Jiří Baumruk, Zdeněk Bobrovský, Miroslav Škeřík, Jaroslav Šíp, Zdeněk Rylich, Jaroslav Tetiva, Radoslav Sís, Eugen Horniak, Jan Kozák, Lubomír Kolář, Dušan Lukášik, Jiří Matoušek, Milan Merkl (Head coach: Josef Fleischlinger)\n1956 Summer Olympic Games: did not participate\n1957 FIBA EuroBasket: finished 3rd among 16 teams\nJiří Baumruk, Miroslav Škeřík, Zdeněk Bobrovský, Jaroslav Šíp, Zdeněk Rylich, Lubomír Kolář, Dušan Lukášik, Jaroslav Chocholáč, Milan Merkl, Nikolaj Ordnung, Jaroslav Tetiva, Jiří Tetiva (Head coach: Gustáv Hermann)\n1959 FIBA EuroBasket: finished 2nd among 17 teams\nJiří Baumruk, František Konvička, Bohumil Tomášek, Jaroslav Křivý, Miroslav Škeřík, Jaroslav Šíp, Boris Lukášik, Dušan Lukášik, Zdeněk Rylich, Jiří Šťastný, Jaroslav Tetiva, Bohuslav Rylich (Head coach: Gustáv Hermann)\n1959 FIBA World Championship: did not participate\n1960 Summer Olympic Games: finished 5th among 16 teams\nJiří Baumruk, František Konvička, Vladimír Pištělák, Bohumil Tomášek, Zdeněk Bobrovský, Jiří Tetiva, Boris Lukášik, Jiří Šťastný, Bohuslav Rylich, Jan Kinský, Dušan Lukášik, Zdeněk Konečný (Head coach: Ivan Mrázek)\n1961 FIBA EuroBasket: finished 5th among 19 teams\nFrantišek Konvička, Vladimír Pištělák, Jiří Baumruk, Zdeněk Bobrovský, Bohumil Tomášek, Bohuslav Rylich, Jaroslav Tetiva, František Pokorný, Zdeněk Konečný, Jiří Marek, Miloš Pražák, Vladimír Lodr (Head coach: L.

        "title": "Switzerland men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Switzerland men's national basketball team (, , , ) represents Switzerland in international basketball. The managing body for the national team is Swiss Basketball.\nSwitzerland has competed at five EuroBasket tournaments (1935, 1946, 1951, 1953, 1955) in their history. The national team has also made three appearances at the Olympic Games (1936, 1948, 1952). However, Switzerland has struggled over the past decades to once again qualify to international competitions. They also continue their pursuit to clinch their debut trip to the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 1935.\nSwitzerland hosted the first European Basketball Championship in Geneva at EuroBasket 1935. The national team finished fourth in the ten team tournament, defeating Romania and Italy in the preliminary round to advance to the semifinals. There they lost to Latvia, resulting in a playoff for third place against Czechoslovakia which the Swiss lost 25–23.\nEuroBasket 1946.\nSwitzerland did not play in the European championship again until the post-war, at EuroBasket 1946, which they hosted. There, they placed second in their three-team preliminary group after losing to the eventual champions Czechoslovakia 20–17, but defeating Belgium 38–33. That preliminary round finish put the Swiss into a 5th/6th place playoff against the Netherlands, which Switzerland won 36–25.\nEuroBasket 1951.\nThe next Swiss entry into the European Basketball Championship was at the EuroBasket 1951 tournament in Paris. Switzerland finished the preliminary round with a 1–3 record, 4th in their group. They fared little better in the first classification, taking 3rd in the group with a 1–2 record. In the second classification round, the Swiss won the classification 13-16 and 13/14 games to finish in 13th place of 18 teams, with a 4–5 record.\nEuroBasket 1953.\nEuroBasket 1953 in Moscow was the fourth appearance of the Swiss. The tournament began poorly for the team, as they finished last in their preliminary pool at 0–3. It got somewhat better for them after that, as they took second in their first classification pool with 2 wins and a loss. They dropped their 9-12 semifinal to Belgium, but defeated Finland in the 11/12 final to take 11th of 17 overall.\nEuroBasket 1955.\nSwitzerland competed next at the EuroBasket 1955 tournament in Budapest. Their 2–2 record in preliminary round put them in 3rd of the five-team group and relegated them to the classification rounds. They had similar results there, again taking a 2–2 record and 3rd of 5 teams. They won their classification 13-16 semifinal, but lost to Austria in the 13/14 game to finish 14th of 18 teams.\nLater years.\nThe 1952 Summer Olympics and the 1955 EuroBasket are the last major international basketball tournaments that the country qualified for. Since then, it lost its international significance despite occasional strong showings at qualification games. E.g. Switzerland surprisingly beat former European Champion Russia at the qualification for the 2015 EuroBasket.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2027 FIBA World Cup Pre-Qualifiers matches on 22 and 25 February 2024 against Azerbaijan and Ireland.\nPast rosters.\n1935 EuroBasket: finished 4th among 10 teams\n3 René Karlen, 4 Raymond Lambercy, 5 Mottier, 6 Jean Pare, 7 Radle, 8 Sidler, 9 Marcel Wuilleumier (Coach: ?)\n1936 Olympic Games: finished 9th among 21 teams\n1 Fernand Bergmann, 2 Pierre Carlier, 3 René Karlen, 4 Georges Laederach, 5 Raymond Lambercy, 6 Jean Pollet, 7 Jean Pare, 8 Marcel Wuilleumier (Coach: ?)\n1946 EuroBasket: finished 5th among 10 teams\n3 Georges Stockly, 4 Fernand Keller, 5 Theo Winkler, 7 Georges Gallay, 8 Henry Gujer, 10 Robert Geiser, 12 Jean Pollet, 13 Jean Pare, 15 René Wohler, 20 Louis Sanguin (Coach: ?)\n1948 Olympic Games: finished 21st among 23 teams\n3 Georges Stockly, 4 Henry Gujer, 5 Jean Pollet, 6 Maurice Chollet, 7 Claude Chevalley, 8 Pierre Albrecht, 9 Marcos Bossy, 10 Robert Geiser, 11 Jean Tribolet, 12 Claude Landini, 13 Jean Pare, 14 Bernard Dutoit, 15 Henri Baumann, 16 Gérald Piaget (Coach: ?)\n1951 EuroBasket: finished 13th among 17 teams\n3 Georges Stockly, 4 Henry Gujer, 5 Theo Winkler, 6 Arthur Bugna, 7 Henri Baumann, 8 Roger Domenjoz, 9 Marcos Bossy, 10 René Wohler, 11 René Chiappino, 12 Bernard Dutoit, 13 Albert Hermann, 14 Roger Prahin, 15 Francis Perroud (Coach: ?)\n1952 Olympic Games: finished 20th among 23 teams\n3 Georges Stockly, 4 Pierre Albrecht, 5 Jacques Redard, 6 Gérald Cottier, 7 Henri Baumann, 8 Roger Domenjoz, 9 Marcos Bossy, 10 René Wohler, 11 René Chiappino, 12 Marcel Moget, 13 Maurice Chollet, 14 Roger Prahin, 15 Bernard Schmied, 16 Jean-Pierre Voisin (Coach: ?)\n1953 EuroBasket: finished 11th among 17 teams\n3 André Laverniaz, 4 Pierre Albrecht, 5 Jacques Redard, 6 Henri Devaud, 7 Albert Hermann, 8 René Hofmann, 9 Marcos Bossy, 10 Gérald Cottier, 11 René Chiappino, 12 Jean Emery, 13 Pierre Wittwer, 14 Michel Currat, 15 Jean-Pierre Voisin, 16 Ruggero Balmelli (Coach: ?)\n1955 EuroBasket: finished 14th among 18 teams\n4 Pierre Albrecht, 5 Jacques Redard, 6 Michel Currat, 7 Henri Baumann, 8 V Bally, 9 C Sevelley, 10 Gérald Cottier, 11 Marcos Bossy, 12 René Chiappino, 13 M Etter, 14 C Lambrecht, 15 Jean-Pierre Voisin, 16 P Worte, 17 M Robert (Coach: ?)\nKit.\nSponsor.\n2017: Tissot"

        "title": "Belgium men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Belgium men's national basketball team has represented Belgium in international basketball since 1928. The supervising body for the national team is Basketball Belgium.\nBelgium has qualified for the EuroBasket 18 times throughout their history, achieving their best result at the event in 1947, where they finished in fourth place. Moreover, Belgium has competed at the Olympic Games on three occasions, in 1936, 1948, and 1952. However, Belgium is still in pursuit of making their first appearance at the FIBA World Cup.\nThe team is nicknamed and also represents itself as Belgian Lions.\nHistory.\n1920s–1950s.\nBelgium played in their first official match on 6 May 1928, a 17–31 loss against France in Brussels. Belgium became a member of FIBA in 1933. In 1935, Belgium participated in the first European Basketball Championship. In their first game of the tournament, Belgium was defeated by Spain 25–17. Following the loss, Belgium was unable to advance into the semi-finals, and completed the rest of the competition in the classification round.\nAt the 1936 Olympic Games, Belgium was quickly eliminated, after posting an (0–2) record during their tournament stint. Ten years later, Belgium reappeared on the international stage at EuroBasket 1946. Entering the competition, the national team lost their only two games of the preliminary round, which sent them into the classification phase. There, Belgium earned a victory against Poland 22–39. The team would pick up one more victory, over Luxembourg, to finish the event in seventh place. A year later, Belgium was back on the continental level for EuroBasket 1947. After dropping their first game of the tournament to Egypt, the national team turned around to heavily defeat Albania 114–11. In their final match of the preliminary round, Belgium won again, this time against Italy to advance. Belgium opened up the second group phase of the competition with a win over France 26–27. However, the team would go (2–2) for the rest of the event, including the classification round, for a fourth place finish. At the 1948 Olympic Games, Belgium failed to advance past the preliminary phase, and was once again relegated to the classification round to complete the event.\nIn 1950, Belgium participated in a European qualifying tournament for the inaugural FIBA World Cup. Ultimately, the team missed out on the competition, after narrow losses to Spain and Yugoslavia. The following year, Belgium entered the EuroBasket 1951, where the team went undefeated in the preliminary round at (3–0). However, the team would endure a complete reversal of their results in the quarter-final round, losing all three of their matches; and being sent into the classification phase to finish out the tournament.\nAt the 1952 Olympic Games, Belgium made their third appearance in the competition, losing two out of their three matches, and failing to make it past the tournament's first round. Heading to EuroBasket 1953, the struggles for Belgium on the international stage continued, as the national team posted a (1–2) record in the preliminary round; and was sent into the classification phase to closeout the event.\nAfter a disappointing tournament for Belgium, the team declined to enter the competition in 1955, and instead entered the event in 1957. However, Belgium would once again compile subpar preliminary phase results at (0–3), and relegated to the classification round. Belgium would lose their first two matches of the phase, before earning their first win of the competition against Austria 58–70. Following the victory, Belgium prevailed in three out of their next four games, including a 90–48 win over Albania in their final game of the tournament. That was where national team guard Eddy Terrace scored (63 points), which set a single game EuroBasket record to that point. Two years later, Belgium made their seventh appearance in the competition for EuroBasket 1959, where they garnered a (2–1) record in the preliminary stage to qualify for the semi-final round. Although after losing two of the three games in the round, Belgium's chances for a medal finish were gone.\n1960s–1990s.\nHeading into the 1960s, Belgium's first competition of the decade came at the EuroBasket 1961. After finishing second in their preliminary round group, the team advanced into the second group phase. However, even after winning three out of their four games in the round, Belgium was eliminated from medal contention. Two years later, at the EuroBasket 1963, Belgium won their opening match of the competition against Turkey 71–52. Although they would only manage to split their next six games in the round (3–3), and sent into the classification bracket to finish the tournament. In the ensuing years for Belgium, frustration continued to mount, as they would only qualify for the Euros once (1967), over the next fourteen years.\nAt EuroBasket 1977, Belgium hosted the event for the first time, and won their opening game 107–98 against Finland. However, the national team would lose three of their next four games in the preliminary round, and once again have to finish the competition in the classification stage. Two years later, Belgium's disastrous performance at the EuroBasket in 1979, culminated with the team going winless (0–7); and completing the tournament in last place. Following the event, Belgium failed to qualify for every major international competition during the 1980s. Fourteen years after competing in their last EuroBasket, Belgium qualified for the tournament in 1993. In Belgium's first game of the event, the national team defeated Slovenia 61–82. Ultimately, the victory for Belgium turned out to be their only one of the tournament, as they lost their next five games before being eliminated.\n2000s–2010s.\nAfter the turn of the century, the arrival of Belgium at the EuroBasket in 2011, marked the first time the national team qualified for the continental stage in 18 years. However, they would endure a disappointing tournament, losing all five of their preliminary round matches to be eliminated. Two years later, the team made it back to the competition for EuroBasket 2013. Following a 57–58 loss to Ukraine in their first game of the tournament, Belgium displayed resilience in their second game, in a 73–77 overtime victory against Germany. Belgium went on to finish the preliminary phase with a (2–3) record, to advance into the second round. There, the team lost two of their three games before exiting the event. Belgium qualified for EuroBasket 2015, after finishing (5–1) during qualifying. Entering the finals, Belgium split their first two games of the competition, before earning a buzzer-beating win over Lithuania 74–76. Belgium would finish the group stage with a (3–2) record to advance. Although in the Round of 16, Belgium would be eliminated by Greece 75–54.\nTo reach EuroBasket 2017, Belgium once again went (5–1) during their qualifying campaign to make the finals. However, Belgium failed to sustain the momentum achieved during their qualification period, and were eliminated after a (1–4) record in the group stage. The struggles for Belgium would continue during European Qualifiers for the 2019 FIBA World Cup, as the team was ousted from the qualifiers following a (1–5) record.\n2020s–present.\nBelgium entered Pre-Qualifiers for the EuroBasket 2022, where the national team went undefeated at (4–0), to move closer to clinching qualification. In the Qualifiers, Belgium completely dominated Lithuania at home in their first game 86–65. Following the victory, Belgium would go on to finish top of their qualifying group, to reach their fifth consecutive Euro finals. Drawn into Group A at the tournament, Belgium split their first two games of the event, prior to their impressive 83–73 win against the eventual champions Spain. Although after making it through the group stage, Belgium was eliminated in the Round of 16 to Slovenia 88–72.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 22 and 25

        "title": "Bulgaria men's national basketball team",
        "text": " \nThe Bulgaria men's national basketball team () represents Bulgaria in international basketball. The governing body is the Bulgarian Basketball Federation.\nBulgaria's first appearance at an international tournament came at the EuroBasket in 1935. They have reached the premier European basketball competition 25 times, with their best results coming in 1957 as the runners-up on home soil, and their bronze medal finish in 1961 respectively. Bulgaria has also qualified for the FIBA World Cup, where they finished seventh in their lone appearance in 1959. Competing at the Olympic Games multiple times, the national team had their top performance in 1956. Bulgaria has also competed at smaller events, such as the Balkan Championship, winning gold medals in 1959, 1960, and 1971.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 1935.\nBulgaria debuted on the international stage at the first EuroBasket (European Basketball Championship), which was held in Geneva, in 1935. The Bulgarian side started the tournament off with a loss to Italy in the preliminary round, but bounced back to defeat Hungary in their next match. Following this, Bulgaria lost their classification matches to Belgium, and to Italy again. The national team would finishing off their tournament debut in 8th place.\nEuroBasket 1947.\nTwelve years later, the Bulgarian national team reached the tournament once again, for their second appearance overall. At the EuroBasket 1947, Bulgaria split their two preliminary round matches against Austria, and France advancing to the upper bracket semifinal groups. There they lost all three of their games, putting them in a 7th/8th place classification match versus Hungary, which they lost. The national team would once again end the tournament reaching the quarterfinals.\nEuroBasket 1951.\nBulgaria's third appearance was at EuroBasket 1951 in Paris. They won their two contested preliminary games, outscoring opponents 145–70, and gained a third win by Romania's forfeit. In the semifinal round, the national team became enmeshed in a three-way tie for first place in the four-team group after losing to France but winning the other two matches, and ended up finishing in second place in the group. This pitted them against the Soviet Union in a semifinal matchup, which the Bulgarians lost. The national team then went on to lose again, in the bronze medal game to France.\nEuroBasket 1953.\nThe national team's next appearance was in Moscow for EuroBasket 1953. They found themselves on the unfortunate end of a three-way tiebreaker after finishing 3–1 in their preliminary group, and their 3rd place rank in the group sent them to the classification round, a disappointing turn of events for Bulgaria which had expected to do at least as well as they had two years prior. They won their next five matches to take the highest place available, after the preliminary round. Thus, reaching the quarterfinals in the tournament with an 8–1 record.\nEuroBasket 1955.\nAt EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest, the Bulgarian side open up their campaign at the tournament with a 107-33 dismantling of Denmark. They would go on to only drop one match in their preliminary group to finish with a 2–1 record, which allowed them to advance to the final round along with group leader Czechoslovakia. After losing to the three eventual medalists in the final round, Bulgaria finished the round with a 4–3 record while once again reaching the semifinals.\nEuroBasket 1957.\nBulgaria hosted the EuroBasket 1957, in Sofia. The national team breezed through their three preliminary round matches, and kept their win streak through the first six of the final round games, including an 82–80 victory over Czechoslovakia. In their final game of the tournament, which by chance was against the similarly undefeated Soviet Union squad, Bulgaria led by 4 points at halftime, 23–19. Their lead did not last through the second half though, however, as the Soviets powered to a 60–57 final, Bulgaria finished as the runners-up with the silver medal.\n1959 World Cup.\nBulgaria made its debut at the World Cup in 1959. They were placed in Group C, where they went undefeated (3-0) and advanced to the final round. There, they finished with a 2–4 record, but after controversy struck. As they along with the Soviets refused to play Formosa, due to political reasons. This mishap caused the national team to be relegated to seventh place at the tournament.\nEuroBasket 1961.\nAt the EuroBasket 1961, the national team returned to the top European basketball tournament looking to place better than their last trip at the event. In their preliminary round group they finished with a 2–0 record to move on to the second round. There they finished with an impressive 4–1 record to advance to the semifinals with a matchup against the Soviet Union. The outcome did not turn out in the favour of the Bulgarian side though, as they were manhandled 77–54. The devastating loss sent the Bulgarians to the bronze medal match versus France, where they came away with a victory to end the tournament on a high note.\nLater years.\nBulgaria would go on to qualify to the European Basketball Championship 16 more times after 1961, but never came away with a top three finish at the event. The Bulgarian side have endured multiple droughts without qualifying as well, e.g. not reaching the tournament for 12 years after EuroBasket 1993 until EuroBasket 2005. As well as not having qualified to the tournament since 2011. They have also attempted to qualify for the World Cup on numerous occasions since 1959, although they have yet to succeed in their bid.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers

        "title": "Hungary men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Hungary men's national basketball team () represents Hungary in international basketball tournaments. It is governed by the Hungarian Basketball Federation (MKOSZ).\nHungary's best period in international basketball competitions came in the 1940s to the 1960s. It was when the national team won several medals at the EuroBasket (1946, 1953, 1955), and reached the Olympic Games on four out of the first six editions of the event overall. However, since 1969, the team has only qualified for the continental showpiece three times (1999, 2017, 2022). Hungary also continues to vie for their debut appearance at the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 1935.\nThe Hungarian side came in ninth place at the first European Basketball Championship, the EuroBasket 1935 held by the International Basketball Federation's FIBA Europe continental federation. They faced the eventual champions Latvia in the preliminary round, falling 46–12. In the classification matches, the Hungarians lost to Bulgaria, then defeated Romania to finish ninth with a 1–2 record.\nEuroBasket 1939.\nAfter not competing in the 1937 edition, the Hungarians returned to the EuroBasket 1939. Once again, Hungary was one of eight teams that qualified for the event. Hungary lost its first six games. The biggest defeat was a massive blowout to the host Lithuania 79-15. Although in their last match, Hungary displayed a strong performance as they defeated Finland 45-16 which provided some reconciliation for their loss against Lithuania. Hungary eventually finished the tournament seventh in the eight team field.\nEuroBasket 1946.\nThe next European competition was the EuroBasket 1946. Hungary placed second in their preliminary round group of four, losing to Italy but defeating Luxembourg and Poland. This qualified the Hungarians for the semi-finals, which they lost to Czechoslovakia. In the bronze medal match, Hungary defeated France 38–32.\nEuroBasket 1947.\nHungary competed at the EuroBasket 1947 the next year. Their 1–1 record in the preliminary phase was sufficient for them to advance to the semifinal groups; However, they lost all three games there. In the 7th/8th place classification match, they defeated Bulgaria 59–29 to finish seventh of the fourteen teams.\nEuroBasket 1953.\nHungary's next appearance at the EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow, resulted in the team's second EuroBasket medal. Their preliminary group adversaries included hosts and defending champions Soviet Union, who gave Hungary their only loss in the pool. Their 2–1 record put Hungary in second place in the pool and advanced them to the final round. There, they lost again to the Soviets as well as fellow perennial powers Czechoslovakia and France. Hungary defeated the other four teams in the round, however, their 4–3 record put them in a tie with Czechoslovakia, France, and Israel. The Hungarians came out on top of the tie-breaker, as they finished in second place overall behind the Soviet Union to take the silver medal.\nEuroBasket 1955.\nThe Hungarian capital Budapest gained the hosting rights for the EuroBasket 1955. The results of the preliminary round were hardly surprising for the Hungarians, as they won all three of their games to proceed to the final round. Their first match in that round was against Czechoslovakia, and the Hungarians quickly found themselves in the bottom half of the final round group with a 75–65 loss. Their next four games, however, were much different and Hungary defeated Poland, Italy, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to rise to a 4–1 record. This put them in a tie for the lead of the group with the Soviet Union, which had lost to Czechoslovakia.\nIn a game that was never particularly close, the Hungarians handed the Soviets only their second loss, 82–68, in 34 games and four EuroBasket tournaments. Hungary advanced to 5–1, in sole lead of the pool, which they never relinquished. Hungary then finished it all off in victorious fashion over Romania to win the gold medal at the Euros for the first time.\nEuroBasket 1957.\nAt the EuroBasket 1957 Hungary cruised to a 3-0 record in their preliminary phase group, with their only true test coming in a narrow 66-65 victory over Romania. It was enough for national team to advance to the final round of the competition. There, they lost in turn to each of the other three preliminary pool winners, finishing at 4–3 in the round to take fourth place overall.\nEuroBasket 2017.\nEuroBasket 2017 marked the first EuroBasket appearance for the national team since 1999. With no real expectations heading into it, Hungary surprised many with their performance in the preliminary stage getting their first EuroBasket victory since 1969. They finished with a 2-3 record, with wins over the Czech Republic, and Romania. It was enough for the national team to advance to the knockout stage. There they matched up against Serbia, where they put up an valiant effort in defeat against the eventual runners-up 86-78.\nEuroBasket 2022 qualification.\nAt the EuroBasket 2022 qualification, Hungary surprisingly defeated defending Champion Slovenia 77-75. Benedek Váradi labelled the victory as \"among the most important\" in his career.\nCompetitive record.\nOlympic Games.\nNotes\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers

        "text": "The Romania men's national basketball team () represents Romania in international basketball competition. The team is administered by the Romanian Basketball Federation (FRB).\nRomania has qualified for the EuroBasket 18 times throughout their history. Their best tournament results occurred in 1957 and 1967 respectively, where they finished fifth. The national team has also appeared at the Olympic Games once, in 1952. However, Romania has yet to clinch qualification for their first trip to the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 1935.\nAt the first European Championship in Geneva, the Romania national team finished in last place in the then ten team tournament. Losing all three of their matches; 42-9 to Switzerland, 66-23 to France, and 24-17 to Hungary.\nEuroBasket 1947.\nRomania returned to the European championship twelve years later in Prague, for the EuroBasket 1947. Romania finished with a record of 1-2 after the preliminary round, which eliminated them from championship contention but they earned their first ever EuroBasket victory against the Netherlands. The Romanians added two more in the classification semifinal, as they defeated Austria and Albania. This put them in a classification match against Italy for 9th and 10th place, which Romania lost 55-39. The national team thus placed tenth again, but this time they had outranked four teams to do so, due to the expansion of the tournament to 14.\nEuroBasket 1951.\nThe Romanian national team entered the EuroBasket 1951 in Paris, but withdrew before any games were played, so official records gave them three preliminary round losses, each with a score of 2-0.\n1952 Summer Olympics.\nRomania managed to qualify for the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, where the national team finished 23rd. It was the first and only time they qualified for the Olympic Basketball Tournament.\nEuroBasket 1953.\nThe EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow was the next European tournament in which the Romanians actually played. They finished in 3rd place in their preliminary round group with a 1-2 record and advanced to the classification rounds. They won 3 of their 4 games there, finishing in a three-way tie for the top spot of the group. They lost out on the tiebreaker though and were relegated to the 13th-16th place semifinals. Winning that game and their next, the Romanians finished in 13th place of the 17 teams in the tournament.\nEuroBasket 1955.\nRomania was much more successful two years later, at the EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest. A preliminary round loss to the global power house Soviet Union mattered little, as the national team won their other three preliminary matches against Sweden, Switzerland and Luxembourg to take second place in the group behind the Soviets to advance to the final round. There, they won games against Poland and Yugoslavia to finish 2-5 in the final round to take 7th place in the 18-team tournament.\nEuroBasket 1957.\nRomania came within a single point of winning their preliminary pool at EuroBasket 1957 in Sofia, losing to Hungary in the narrow match. They beat their other two opponents Belgium and Finland to finish in second place in the pool to advance into the final round. There, they matched up again with Hungary, but the game wasn't as close as the Hungarians cruised to a 76-61 victory. The national team also lost to the other three pool winners, to finish with a 3-4 record to end the tournament in 5th place.\nLater years.\nThe team repeated its most successful campaign at the EuroBasket 1967 when it finished 5th again. The following years, the team had some successful performances but after 1987, it ceded completely from Europe's elite events. After 30 years of absence, Romania returned to the EuroBasket in 2017 when the country gained hosting rights alongside Finland, Israel and Turkey. However, the national team ended its participation with five losses in its five games played.\nEuroBasket 2022 qualification.\nAfter defeating both Slovakia and Cyprus twice, the Tricolorii advanced to the final qualification round where they came short of their second EuroBasket qualification since 1987. The team was coached by Tudor Costescu.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2027 FIBA World Cup Pre-Qualifiers match on 22 February 2024 against Luxembourg.\nPast rosters.\n1935 EuroBasket: finished 10th among 10 teams\n3 Nae Alexandrescu, 4 Balteanu, 5 O.Belitoreanu, 6 M.Bercus, 7 E.Dumitrescu, 8 Nicu Grozavescu, 9 Samy Grunstein, 10 C.Riegler (Coach: C.

        "title": "Peter Sterling (rugby league)",
        "text": "Peter Maxwell John Sterling (born 16 June 1960) nicknamed Sterlo, is an Australian former rugby league commentator, television personality and player. He was one of the all-time great halfbacks and a major contributor to Parramatta Eels' dominance of the New South Wales Rugby League premiership in the 1980s. Sterling played eighteen Tests for the Australian national team between 1982 and 1988. He also played in thirteen State of Origins for New South Wales, winning man of the match on four occasions (one of them being the 1987 exhibition match played in the USA). Sterling played in four premiership-winning sides with Parramatta in 1981–1983 and 1986 and has been inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame. His time spent playing for English club Hull F.C. also earned him membership in their hall of fame.\nEarly life.\nSterling was born in Toowoomba, Queensland, and raised in Raymond Terrace and Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. He attended Kooringal High School.\nHe commenced his playing career at the age of fourteen when he joined the Wagga Wagga Kangaroo Panthers in 1974. As a teenager Sterling spent several years living at RAAF Base Wagga, where his father was serving as a dental technician. Sterling then moved to Sydney, where he attended the Patrician Brothers' College on a scholarship.\nPlaying career.\nSterling compensated for a lack of size and pace with control and organisational skills that allowed Parramatta's all-star back line of Brett Kenny, Mick Cronin, Steve Ella and Eric Grothe a great deal of ball. His kicking, backed up by Kenny and Ray Price's superb chasing, often gave Parramatta an advantage in territory. His fast mind meant that he rarely made a wrong decision.. He was an effective defender who rarely missed tackles, and was often in position to secure a loose ball.\nSterling joined the Parramatta Eels in 1978, making his first appearance as a during the 1978 finals series, in the 17–11 minor semi-final replay loss to eventual premiers Manly. After a few games at in 1979, Sterling shifted to halfback and established himself as a player to watch in 1980. 1981 saw the Jack Gibson-coached Eels win their first Grand Final with a 20–11 win over the Tommy Raudonikis-led Newtown Jets, with Sterling's superb skill and control one of the decisive factors. He made his State of Origin début for NSW in the 1981 State of Origin game, setting up a try for Mick Cronin, though the Wally Lewis-captained Queenslanders turned a ten-point half time deficit into a seven-point, 22–15 win. Sterling himself admitted he was a surprise choice for NSW as he had only made his representative début a few weeks earlier when he played for City Seconds and rated himself as fifth in line for the NSW job. He was ultimately selected over his long-time rival for the NSW halfback spot, Canterbury-Bankstown's Steve Mortimer who had debuted for Australia in their two-Test series win over France only weeks before the Origin game.\nIn 1982, Parramatta could seemingly do no wrong, winning the minor premiership by four games over Manly. Though they were beaten 20–0 by Manly in the major semi-final, the Eels then thrashed Eastern Suburbs 33–0 in the preliminary final, before going on to turn the tables on the Sea Eagles with a 21–8 victory in the Grand Final at the Sydney Cricket Ground to win their second successive premiership.\nSterling was then chosen for the 1982 Kangaroo tour, and along with Queensland halfback Mark Murray was back-up to incumbent Test halfback Mortimer, despite having not played in the 1982 State of Origin series. After travelling with part of the team to Perth to face a Western Australian team and thus missing a place in Australia's first ever Test against Papua New Guinea, Sterling was presented a golden opportunity by coach Frank Stanton when he was chosen for the first game of the tour against English club side Hull Kingston Rovers. Sterling went about cementing his place in the Kangaroos’ \"A\" side and went on to make his Test début for Australia in the first Ashes Test against Great Britain at Boothferry Park in Hull. The 1982 Kangaroos went on to become the first team to go through Great Britain and France undefeated, earning them the nickname \"The Invincibles\", and was a personal success for Sterling who played in all five Tests against Great Britain and France, and cemented his place as the world's best halfback.\nIn 1983, Sterling played in Australia's win in the first Test against New Zealand at Carlaw Park in Auckland, but wasn't selected for Australia's shock 12–19 second Test loss at Lang Park when Murray was preferred. He was named man-of-the-match in Game 2 of the State of Origin series at the SCG, a game which saw the NSW side host an almost all-Parramatta backline, with Neil Hunt and Eric Grothe (wings), Mick Cronin and Steve Ella (centres) and Sterling and Brett Kenny (halves), while the Blues, who defeated Queensland 10–6, were also captained by Eels forward Ray Price. Sterling then helped Parramatta to a third successive Grand Final win with an 18–6 win, again over runaway minor premiers Manly. Following his third successive premiership and his fifth overall, Jack Gibson, a man Peter Sterling held high praise for as both a person and a coach, shocked the establishment and resigned as Parramatta coach.\nFollowing the 1982 Kangaroo Tour, Sterling had been highly sought after by English clubs and he went on to play for Hull F.C. in the 1983–84 English season. Sterling played , and was man of the match in winning the White Rose Trophy with a 29–12 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1984 Yorkshire Cup Final during the 1984–85 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull, on Saturday 27 October 1984. He was then chosen for Game 1 of the 1984 State of Origin series, but lost his place to Steve Mortimer for the rest of the series. Sterling was then overlooked for the home Ashes series against Great Britain in 1984, but would still go on to win the \"Rugby League Week\" Player of the Year award for the first time. In the 1984 Grand Final, Sterling and longtime halves partner Brett Kenny had few opportunities against Mortimer's Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs whose forwards dominated the Eels pack and gave the star pairing little room to move. The narrow 6–4 loss to the Bulldogs ended the John Monie-coached Parramatta's bid for a fourth successive premiership.\nSterling did not play for Parramatta, in the first half of 1985 as he returned to England to again link with Hull. Peter Sterling played in Hull FC's 0–12 defeat by Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1984–85 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1984–85 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull on Saturday 26 January 1985. Though he was relatively quiet upon his return to Parramatta, at the end of the season Sterling's skill allowed Parramatta to defeat Balmain (twice, the second a 32–4 win in the Minor-Semi) and Penrith (Minor Preliminary-Semi), to move from doubtful finalists to the Preliminary Final – where a ruthless Canterbury side on their way to a second successive premiership, easily accounted for the Eels 26–0. As a result of his decision to play in England and miss the first part of the NSWRL premiership, Sterling lost his place in the NSW side in the 1985 State of Origin series to Steve Mortimer, who led the Blues to their first ever series win over Queensland. He also miss his chance to regain his test place for the mid-season tour of New Zealand in 1985, with the halfback role shared between Mark Murray and Manly's versatile utility Des Hasler. By missing both Origin and Test selection in 1985, Sterling missed the opportunity to link with the coach who gave him his first grade début at Parramatta Terry Fearnley, who coached both representative teams.\nWhile playing for Hull in the early part of 1985, Sterling led the team into the 1985 Challenge Cup Final against Wigan, which also included a number of internationals such as; fullback Gary Kemble, wingers Dane O'Hara and James Leuluai and his halves partner Fred Ah Kuoi (all NZ), centre Garry Schofield (GB), Parramatta second-rower John Muggleton (Aus), and goal kicking forward (and Hull captain) Lee Crooks (GB), Sterling played in Hull FC's 24–28 defeat by Wigan in the 1985 Challenge Cup Final during the 1984–85 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 4 May 1985, in front of a crowd of 99,801, in what is regarded as the most marvellous cup final in living memory, which Hull narrowly lost after fighting back from 12–28 down at half-time, with Sterling's Parramatta halves partner Brett Kenny (playing for Wigan) was voted man of the match winning the Lance Todd Trophy. Sterling, who produced a great game in both attack and defense, had gone into the game as one of the shortest priced favourites to win the Lance Todd Trophy, with bookmakers in Hull allegedly (according to BBC commentator Ray French during the telecast of the Cup Final) refusing to field any more bets on Sterling in the week leading up to the game.\n1986 saw Sterling almost carry a clean sweep of the major awards – except the Rothmans Medal – and win the inaugural Clive Churchill Medal in Parramatta's fourth Grand Final victory, reversing the 1984 result with a 4–2 win over Canterbury-Bankstown to send the retiring Mick Cronin and team captain Ray Price out as premiership winners. 1986 also saw the Parramatta with their own home ground for the first time since over-excited fans had burned down the old Cumberland Oval grandstand during the 1981 Grand Final celebrations. Between 1982 and 1985 the club was forced to play home games at Canterbury-Bankstown's home ground, the Belmore Sports Ground, but in 1986 the new Parramatta Stadium was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Sterling set about making the venue his own personal playground.\nDuring the year he was also part of the NSW Team which swept Qld 3–0 in the State of Origin series (the first time in series history a team had won all three games), winning man of the match in Game 2 at the SCG. After regaining his test place in the successful two test series against New Zealand, Sterling was an automatic selection for his second Kangaroo tour at the end of the season, this time going away as the undisputed number one halfback with 1985 test halfback Des Hasler.\nSterling won The Rothman's medal in 1987 and 1990 but only featured in one match of The 1991 season after suffering a shoulder injury. He returned to the field in 1992, but his shoulder was injured again after being hit in a hard tackle by Western Suburbs player David Gillespie. This would prove to be Sterling's final game as he retired due to being unable to recover from the recurring shoulder problem.\nPost-playing career.\nSterling lives in Nelson Bay with his wife, Selina, and daughter Hannah. His hobbies include golf and the breeding of thoroughbreds. Sterling supports Liverpool F.C. in the Premier League.\nTelevision / Radio career.\nSterling's sharp intelligence marked him as an astute analyst of the game with the former Eel commentating for the Nine Network after initially starting in the media with Western Sydney radio station 2WS and Channel 10 where he was a sideline commentator for their coverage of the 1987 NSWRL finals.\nHis autobiography, 'Sterlo! The Story of a Champion' was released in 1989.\nSterling later went on to host \"The Sunday Footy Show\", anchoring the program from the show's inception in 1993 until the end of the 2015 season with him being replaced by Yvonne Sampson from the 2016 season.\nSterling was also co-host of Nine's \"The NRL Footy Show\" from 1994–2006 alongside Paul Vautin. \nHe made a guest appearance in 2007 on the first episode for the year to say farewell to the show before coming back for a short stint in 2010 as alternating host.\nHe currently hosts Nine's 'Thursday Night Football' and is a member of their commentary team, he also rotates the hosting of 'Sunday Afternoon Football' with Yvonne Sampson.\nSterling joined Triple M in March 2010 as an expert commentator on \"Monday Night Football\" and is an occasional panellist on Dead Set Legends and The Rush Hour.\nIn March 2013, Sterling began hosting a weekly NRL show on Fox Sports called 'Sterlo; airing on Thursday nights. His show was axed in 2014 due to poor ratings competing with The Footy Show.\nSterling now hosts \"On the Couch with Sterlo\" which airs on Tuesday every week. He hosted the Fox Sports program between the 2015 and 2017 seasons before signing an exclusive deal with channel Nine from 2018 onwards.\nOn 9 August 2021, it was announced that Sterling would be leaving the Nine Network after 27 years.\nRugby League awards.\nSince retiring from playing the game, Sterling has won several awards.\nIn 1995, Sterling was picked at halfback in a poll to judge the best Australian team since the introduction of the limited-tackle rule in 1967. He won eight of fourteen votes, with the remainder going to Billy Smith, Ricky Stuart and Allan Langer.\nIn 2000 Sterling was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. He was also inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in that year. In 2006, he was one of six past players to be inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame at the Dally M. Awards 2006 award ceremony.\nIn February 2008, Sterling was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.\nAwards"

        "text": "The Hong Kong Cricket Sixes is a Six-a-side international cricket tournament held at the Kowloon Cricket Club comprising between eight and twelve teams. Organised by Cricket Hong Kong, it is sanctioned by the International Cricket Council. The tournament is designed for television viewing, with rules and a venue that encourage aggressive batting and high scoring. Because every player (except the wicket-keeper) is required to bowl one over, the format suits all-rounders.\nAll editions of the tournament have been held at the Kowloon Cricket Club except for the 1996 and 1997 editions which were held at the Hong Kong Stadium.\nHistory.\nIn 2007, Sri Lanka defeated an All-Stars team (featuring players such as Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Shane Warne) to take the title.\nThe All-Stars returned for the 2008 event with West Indies batting great Brian Lara and New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming as members. They joined nine representative international teams in the tournament – defending champions Sri Lanka, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, and hosts Hong Kong.\nThe 2009 tournament, held from 31 October to 1 November, saw eight teams competing, with South Africa defeating Hong Kong in the final.\nIn 2011, the Hong Kong Cricket Association was awarded HK$3.5 million by the Hong Kong SAR government's Mega Event Fund (MEF) to organise the event, with added sponsorship from the KARP Group. To comply with the Mega Events Fund's objectives of promoting Hong Kong as an events capital in Asia, some changes were made to the format. \nThese included expanding the tournament from two to three days, with tournament play starting on the Friday of the event weekend. The field was also increased from 8 to 12 teams with the addition of three more national teams and an invitational squad of international players.\nThe HKCA did not make another MEF application in 2012 due to time constraints, preferring instead to rely on a smaller grant through the government's 'M' Mark scheme. This resulted in a downscaled tournament played over two days on 27–28 October with eight teams (excluding the All-Stars side).\nIn 2013, the Hong Kong Cricket Association's applications for MEF contributions (at first HK$10 million then revised to HK$5 million) were turned down, leaving it with a budget of HK$1 million from the M-Mark scheme to organise the tournament. The association felt that a further HK$500,000 to HK$1 million would be needed to organise the tournament and cancelled it after not securing private sponsorship.\nOn 28 June 2017, Cricket Hong Kong announced that the Hong Kong Sixes will return on 28–29 October following a five-year absence, the event will take place at the Kowloon Cricket Club.\nMatch rules.\nThe Laws of Cricket apply, except:"

Both were educated at Ysgol Glantaf which has educated several Wales internationals and Cardiff-based players, including Jamie Roberts. Nicky Robinson speaks Welsh fluently.\nNick was one of European rugby's leading fly-halves and he has amassed nearly 1,500 points to date in club rugby for his four professional sides - Cardiff Blues, Gloucester, Wasps &amp; Bristol.\nA left-footed fly-half, Nick was famous for his exciting running game.\nIn May 2009 he joined Gloucester Rugby from Cardiff Blues on a three-year contract. He played a central role as Cardiff Blues thrashed Gloucester in the Anglo-Welsh Cup Final at Twickenham earlier that year.\nIn his two seasons at Gloucester Nick was a model of consistency for the English Premiership side, making 60 appearances and scoring in excess of 500 points as Gloucester reached the Anglo-Welsh Cup Final in 2010 (where they lost to Northampton Saints), the Anglo-Welsh Cup Final again in 2011 - where Nick was named man-of-the-match as Gloucester overcame Newcastle Falcons - and the Premiership play-off semi-finals, where a late try from Nick wasn't enough as Gloucester went down 12–10 to eventual winners Saracens.\nIn February 2011 it was announced he would be joining London Wasps from Gloucester Rugby on a two-year contract, teaming up again with former Cardiff Blues coach Dai Young.\nDespite 2011/2012 being a difficult season for Wasps off the field, on it Nick was a virtual ever-present in the starting line-up, scoring 230 points in 25 appearances as the club reached the quarter-finals of the European Challenge Cup.\nOn 21 February 2013, Robinson signed for Bristol Rugby in the RFU Championship and for the 2013–14 season.\nOn 29 January 2015, it was announced Robinson would join French Top 14 side Oyonnax on a three-year deal from the 2015–16 season.\nRobinson retired from playing in July 2016, but re-signed for Cardiff Blues in November of the same year.\nIn August 2017 it was announced that Robinson would remain at Cardiff Blues in a coaching capacity, taking on the role of kicking coach alongside former Blues scrum half Richie Rees, who would be working as backs coach.\nIn April 2018 Robinson married Lyndsey Dalglish the daughter of Kenny Dalglish."

He was an All-American college player for the Pittsburgh Panthers and won an Olympic bronze medal as a member of the United States national team in 1988.\nCollege career.\nAs a college player, Smith was named Big East Player of the Year in 1988. He was a member of the University of Pittsburgh's highly touted five-man recruiting class considered the country's best. Along with power forward Jerome Lane, Smith and the Pitt Basketball Team became a major force in college basketball, opening the 1987–88 season ranked No. 4 nationally and rising as high as No. 2. during Smith's tenure.\nHe played for the US national team in the 1986 FIBA World Championship, where he won the gold medal, and at the 1988 Olympics, where he finished with a bronze.\nNBA career.\nAfter his college career, the 6'10\", 245 lb. power forward was selected third overall in the 1988 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers but immediately traded to the Los Angeles Clippers. He made the 1988 NBA All-Rookie Team by averaging 16 points and 8 rebounds. During his four years with the Clippers where he was among the team's top scorers and rebounders, he averaged 19 points and 7 rebounds. He was later traded to the New York Knicks with Doc Rivers and Bo Kimble for point guard Mark Jackson. Smith was expected to fill the hole at small forward left by Xavier McDaniel after the Knicks failed to re-sign him after their successful 1991–92 season, a role that Smith struggled in as he was primarily a power forward. His knees became more problematic playing small forward around this time. As Smith's stats declined, he was traded to the San Antonio Spurs for J. R. Reid before retiring in 1998.\nPost-retirement.\nSmith is a Resource Board Member of Family Office Association developing global partnerships. Prior, he was Head of Sports &amp; Entertainment MediaCom and Head of New Business for Midas Exchange, both owned by WPP/GroupM. \nAfter retiring from the NBA, Smith served as Team Representative for the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) and then as First Vice President.

        "title": "Cricket Wireless",
        "text": "Cricket Wireless is an American wireless service provider, owned by AT&amp;T. It provides wireless services to ten million subscribers in the United States. Cricket Wireless was founded in March 1999 by Leap Wireless International. AT&amp;T acquired Leap Wireless International in March 2014, and later merged Cricket Wireless operations with Aio Wireless. Cricket Wireless competes primarily against T-Mobile's Metro by T-Mobile, Dish's Boost Mobile and Verizon's Visible in the prepaid wireless segment.\nHistory.\nCricket Wireless was founded in March 1999 by Leap Wireless International. AT&amp;T acquired Leap Wireless International in March 2014 and merged Cricket Wireless with Aio Wireless. Before AT&amp;T's acquisition, the company had 4.5 million subscribers.\nCricket's first market was Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1999 and through much of its early growth became known as a network focused on small, rural markets.\nIn September 2007, MetroPCS, Cricket Wireless's competing carrier at the time, announced a $5.3 billion bid to merge with Leap Wireless. Leap informally rejected the bid less than two weeks later. MetroPCS officially withdrew the bid less than two months later. In December 2007, Cricket acquired Hargray Communications Group's wireless telecommunications business.\nIn September 2008, Cricket and MetroPCS entered into a ten-year roaming agreement covering both companies' existing and future markets. The companies also entered into a spectrum exchange agreement covering licenses in certain markets. In November 2008, they launched \"Premium Extended Coverage\", a roaming partnership with 14 wireless companies. In August 2010, Cricket and Sprint signed a five-year wholesale agreement (MVNO) which allowed Cricket to utilize Sprint's nationwide 3G EVDO network in the United States.\nIn late 2010 at CES 2011, Cricket unveiled Muve Music, the carriers own music streaming service alongside the $199 Samsung Suede SCH-r710 which was the first phone to support Muve Music and included a 4GB SD Card to store music on. Muve Music was initially included in its own $55 plan but was later expanded to all plans as a $5 add-on before being included in all plans free-of-charge. The music service was deemed by Cricket as a major success and credited with helping drive up at least 100,000 new subscribers in the course of a few months. Muve Music originally required an SD Card with a capacity of at least 4GBs to download music, the ability to do so without an SD Card was introduced in version 4.0 of Muve Music but required an internal storage capacity of at least 4GBs. Muve Music 4.0 was officially unveiled on the Samsung Galaxy S III, Samsung Galaxy S4 and Samsung Galaxy Discover while the Samsung Galaxy Admire would ship with version 3.5 but was upgradeable to version 4.0. At its peak, the service was the biggest music streaming service in regards to paying customers with a customer base of 2.3 million users and was hinted in making appearances in international markets such as in Brazil. The fate of the service was put in doubt after the acquisition of Crickets parent company, Leap Wireless, by AT&amp;T and was rumored to be merged with AT&amp;Ts own Beats Music service or possibly left as-is. AT&amp;T expressed a lack of interest in maintaining the service and discontinued it in May 2014. AT&amp;T made Muve Music inaccessible to any new phone purchased after the merger but allowed legacy handsets bought before the merger to access the service. The service was acquired by Deezer for $100 million and formally shut down on February 7, 2015. Deezer offered all Cricket customers a discounted $6 plan which was made available on January 31, 2015. Cricket offers a variety of phones including most of the latest iPhone and Android models.\nIn July 2013, AT&amp;T agreed to buy Cricket Wireless' parent for $1.2 billion. The FCC approved the acquisition between AT&amp;T and Leap Wireless in March 2014. In doing so, AT&amp;T merged its own Aio Wireless prepaid brand into Cricket to form the \"New Cricket\". Cricket Wireless began a gradual shutdown of its CDMA network in March 2015 before a total shutdown in September 2015 and moved all users over to AT&amp;Ts GSM network. All users were required to buy new devices in order to be able to maintain connectivity to the new Cricket network. Cricket Wireless, alongside AT&amp;T, shut down its 2G networks on December 31, 2016. Customers with legacy handsets were also required to upgrade their devices to use on newer networks.\nCricket Wireless deployed its 5G network nationwide on August 21, 2020. Shortly afterward, Cricket announced the shutdown of its 3G network starting in February 2022.\nCoverage network.\nPrior to its acquisition by AT&amp;T, Cricket's CDMA network used its home network and roaming agreements with Sprint, among other CDMA carriers. However, Cricket's CDMA network was shut down and the spectrum was reframed for use on AT&amp;T's HSPA+ and LTE networks. Following the acquisition by AT&amp;T, Cricket Wireless released devices that use AT&amp;T's 3G, 4G, and 4G LTE networks.\nCricket Wireless noted on its old website that CDMA service would be terminated as early as September 2015. Most devices prior to the merger would not be compatible on the GSM network except the iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, and iPhone 5s. Compatible iPhone devices would only require a new SIM card.\nControversies.\nCDMA phones.\nIn May 2015, Cricket Wireless was sued for selling CDMA phones that would not work after the merger with AT&amp;T. The lawsuit alleged that Cricket knew at the time of the merger with AT&amp;T that any devices sold would soon need to be replaced because AT&amp;T's network did not support CDMA devices and yet continued to do so. The lawsuit further stated that \"AT&amp;T and Cricket had decided to discontinue the CDMA network and require Cricket customers to use AT&amp;T's GSM cellular network\" yet continued to sell the devices, and due to Cricket's policy of not unlocking cellphones at that time, \"the cellphones became useless and worthless.\" The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and Cricket was forced to either unlock the locked cell phones, provide 1 month of free service on the 1GB plan for former customers and waive the activation fee, or provide current customers with one extra gigabyte of data for four months.\nA similar lawsuit was filed by the Attorney General of Maryland in June 2020 for violating the state's consumer protection act.\nSTARTTLS stripping attack.\nIn October 2014, Cricket Wireless (and its parent company, AT&amp;T) came under scrutiny for intercepting and modifying its customers' email traffic to downgrade and prevent encryption of the conversation and its metadata. An engineer at a digital security and privacy firm, Golden Frog, first noticed the issue in September 2013 via his Aio Wireless connection (later acquired by Cricket). Upon further investigation by the privacy firm in June 2014, Golden Frog determined that Cricket masked the STARTTLS command in email server responses, thereby \"putting its customers at serious risk by inhibiting their ability to protect online communications.\" In October, a \"Washington Post\" investigation revealed that \"Cricket did not address repeated questions about the issue and did not alert customers, many of whom rely on Cricket as their sole Internet service, that they would not be able to protect their e-mails from prying eyes. AT&amp;T, which absorbed Cricket when it acquired Leap Wireless that spring, did not respond to a request for comment.\" The EFF also published a technical analysis condemning ISPs like Cricket for tampering with customer internet traffic."

        "title": "Tim Johnson (baseball)",
        "text": "Timothy Evald Johnson (born July 22, 1949) is a former professional baseball player and manager. A shortstop and utility infielder in Major League Baseball from 1973 to 1979, he became better known as manager of the Toronto Blue Jays.\nPlaying career.\nAfter signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1967 as a free agent, Johnson was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Rick Auerbach just as the 1973 season began while still a minor leaguer. Johnson played every day for the 1973 Brewers at shortstop, but lost his starting job next season to Robin Yount, thus forcing him to settle in as a utility infielder. He was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays during the 1978 season where he retired a year later with a lifetime .223 batting average in 516 career games.\nScouting, coaching and managerial career.\nAfter retiring as a player, Johnson spent the next 20 years as a scout, coach or minor league manager for the Dodgers, Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs.\n1998 Toronto Blue Jays season.\nThe Blue Jays named Johnson as their manager for the 1998 season following the firing of Cito Gaston and the interim management of pitching coach Mel Queen. Johnson beat out several higher-profile candidates, most notably Davey Johnson (no relation), Larry Bowa, and Buck Martinez.\nQueen remained on as pitching coach under Johnson and the two reportedly feuded extensively, despite Johnson's reputation as a good communicator. Johnson also had rumoured differences with several of his players, including Pat Hentgen, Ed Sprague, and Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens.\nDespite this lack of chemistry, Johnson guided the 1998 Blue Jays to a respectable third-place finish in the AL East with an 88–74 record, just four games out of a tie for the wild card. It was the team's first winning season since they won two World Series in a row in 1992 and 1993.\nVietnam War stories controversy.\nThis success was partly attributed to the stories Johnson would tell his players about his battle experiences in the Vietnam War. For example, he told Hentgen a story about his war experiences to get him to accept a different place in the pitching rotation.\nHowever, in late November 1998, Johnson told several Toronto newspapers all of these stories were completely made up. In truth, Johnson had been in the Marine Corps Reserve throughout the war, and trained mortarmen at Camp Pendleton, California, while playing in the Dodgers' farm system. He'd also claimed for over 20 years he had been an All-American high school basketball player, and turned down a scholarship to attend UCLA.\nDuring the 1998 baseball winter meetings, Johnson said admitting the truth was like having \"a 50,000 pound weight\" taken off his shoulders. He said he had lied because he felt guilty about going to spring training with the Dodgers while many of his friends fought in the war. He entered therapy, and called several of his players to apologize for lying.\nDeparture from the Blue Jays.\nThe Blue Jays were initially willing to stand by Johnson and let him return for 1999. During spring training, he apologized to the entire team, and later said that he did not seem to detect a credibility problem. However, the next month brought a steady diet of questions about Johnson's credibility, as well as outside attacks (Sprague, for instance, called Johnson a \"liar\" and a \"backstabber\"). Finally, on March 17, less than a month before opening day, Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash fired Johnson and replaced him with Jim Fregosi. Ash said Johnson's presence had become so much of a distraction he felt he would have to fire Johnson \"if not now ... 30 or 45 days from now.\" He decided he had to act in order to save the season. After Johnson's one season at the helm, the Blue Jays failed to achieve an equal or better record than Johnson's 88–74 mark until 2015. To date, it is Johnson's last job in Major League Baseball.\nAfter MLB.\nFollowing his dismissal from the Blue Jays, Johnson spent seven seasons as manager in the Mexican League, with the Diablos Rojos del México in 1999-2002, Yaquis de Obregón in 2002-2003 and then with the Águilas de Mexicali in 2004-2005.\nIn 2003, Johnson became manager of the Lincoln Saltdogs of the Northern League. In 2006, the Lincoln team joined the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. On September 25, 2008, Johnson resigned after six years. His career record as the Saltdogs' manager was 315–255.\nOn December 16, 2008, Johnson was announced as the inaugural manager of the Golden Baseball League incarnation of the Tucson Toros.\nOn November 12, 2010, Johnson was announced as the second manager of the Lake County Fielders of the North American League.\nOn July 9, 2011, Johnson resigned from his Lake County Fielders Managerial Position\nJohnson later became field manager with the El Paso Diablos in 2012, but the team folded in 2013.\nJohnson coached in the Arizona Winter League as of 2017 and spent time in the California Winter League from 2010–2014 as an instructor and coach. He also coached the Algodoneros de San Luis of the Liga Norte de Mexico later in 2017, before he was promoted to manager of the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican League on June 4, 2017. Taking over about halfway through the season, Johnson led the Pericos to their second straight championship appearance.\nJohnson was named manager of the Tigres de Quintana Roo of the Mexican League for the 2018 season.\nJohnson was announced as manager for the Piratas de Campeche of the Mexican League for the 2019 season. However, he was fired 33 games into the season on May 13 after a 10-23 start to the season.\nHe was hired by the Bravos de León of the Mexican League for the 2020 season. The team posted a 29-37 record and did not make the playoffs. Johnson was dismissed by the team following the season.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "text": "Chess boxing, or chessboxing, is a hybrid sport that combines two traditional disciplines: chess and boxing. Two combatants play alternating rounds of blitz chess and boxing until one wins by checkmate or knockout. It is also possible to win by time penalty as in normal chess, and by boxing decision if there is a draw in the chess round.\nTypically, events are held in a standard boxing ring using standard amateur boxing equipment and rules. The chess round is also played in the ring with the table, board, and seating being moved in and out of the ring for each round.\nThe governing bodies of chessboxing are the World Chessboxing Association and the World Chess Boxing Organisation.\nChessboxing was invented by French comic book artist Enki Bilal and adapted by Dutch performance artist Iepe Rubingh as an art performance and has subsequently grown into a competitive sport. Chessboxing is particularly popular in the United Kingdom, India, Finland, France, and Russia.\nHistory.\nAn earlier version of combining chess and boxing took place in a boxing club outside London in the late 1970s. The Robinson brothers were in the habit of playing a round of chess against one another after a training session at their boxing club. The concept of chessboxing was first coined in the 1979 kung fu film \"Mystery of Chessboxing\" made by Joseph Kuo, where it referred to the Chinese variant of chess, xiangqi. In homage to the film of the same name, the band Wu-Tang Clan brought chessboxing into popular consciousness for the first time in 1993, when they released the song \"Da Mystery of Chessboxin.\nThe first chessboxing event was put on by Dutch performance artist Iepe Rubingh. Rubingh's idea to create a new sport fusing the two disciplines, chess and boxing, originates from the 1992 comic \"Froid Équateur\", written by French comic book artist Enki Bilal, that portrays a chessboxing world championship. In the comic book version, however, the opponents fight an entire boxing match before they face each other in a game of chess. Finding this to be impractical, Rubingh developed the idea further until it turned into the competitive sport that chessboxing is today, with alternating rounds of chess and boxing and a detailed set of rules and regulations.\nEarly years.\nThe first chessboxing competition took place in Berlin in 2003. That same year, the first world championship fight was held in Amsterdam, in cooperation with the Dutch Boxing Association as well as the Dutch Chess Federation and under the auspices of the World Chess Boxing Organization (WCBO) that had been founded in Berlin shortly before. Dutch middleweight fighters Iepe Rubingh and Jean Louis Veenstra faced each other in the ring. After his opponent exceeded the chess time limit, Rubingh won the fight in the eleventh round, going down in the history books as the first-ever World Chess Boxing Champion.\nWCBA and WCBO.\nBy 2012, Rubingh in Berlin and Tim Woolgar in London had become the two shining lights of the chessboxing scene. Rubingh's events tended to have a more serious tone, while Woolgar's brought a party atmosphere and larger crowds. These two champions of the new sport were unable to agree on forming a unified style, which eventually left the sport with two governing bodies: the World Chessboxing Association (WCBA) and the WCBO. This period in chessboxing history was immortalised in the film \"By Rook or Left Hook – The Story of Chessboxing\".\n2005–2008: First champions.\nThe first European Chess Boxing Championship took place in Berlin on 1 October 2005. Present-day chessboxing commentator Andreas Dilschneider was defeated by Tihomir Dovramadjiev (FIDE Master) when he resigned in the ninth round of chess, crowning the latter by being the first European Chess Boxing Champion. A video report by German television channel RBB presented the event in detail. In 2006, more than 800 spectators filled the Gloria Theatre in Cologne for the world championship qualification fight between Zoran Mijatovic and Frank Stoldt. The 36-year-old Frank Stoldt, who was a former UN peacekeeper in Kosovo and Afghanistan, won when his opponent resigned in chess in the seventh round. After qualifying to fight for the title in 2006, Frank Stoldt went up against American David Depto in November 2007 in Berlin to fight for the first world championship title in the light heavyweight division. More than 800 tickets were sold for the event at the Tape Club in Berlin, making it the biggest chessboxing title fight to that date. Frank Stoldt defeated Depto in the seventh round and thereby cemented Berlin's status as the leading city in the chessboxing world and becoming the first German world champion.\n2008–2011: Growth.\nChessboxing first received credit from the International Chess Federation FIDE, in April 2008; its president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, took part in a chessboxing demo fight in Elista. In 2008, chessboxing clubs were founded in London and Krasnoyarsk. Created in 2009, the Los Angeles Chessboxing Club was the first of its kind in the United States and was directly followed by the New York Chessboxing Club in 2010. The Boxer in Munich also opened in 2010 and offers chessboxing training. In addition to the WCBO's initially European and later world championships taking place, the scene at the London Chessboxing Club grew as well. In 2011, the first international club matchup took place, with Berlin and London in the ring.\n2011–2014: Global expansion.\nIn 2011, the WCBO and with it, the global chessboxing community, made the biggest leap forward in its development to date with the foundation of the Chessboxing Organisation of India and its expansion in Asia, including Chessboxing China and the Chessboxing Organisation of Iran, which was founded in 2012. Furthermore, the third chessboxing organization in the United States, USA Chessboxing, was founded in 2011 and the European movement was being reinforced by the foundation of the Italian Chessboxing Federation in 2012. In addition to the WCBO becoming a registered association under German law in 2014, the Chess Boxing Global Marketing CBGM GmbH – called Chess Boxing Global (CBG) – was founded; it is responsible for organizing all professional chessboxing fights worldwide and above all, for the organization of the Chess Boxing World Championships.\nThe Chess Boxing Organisation India was founded in 2011 by kickboxing official and former Indian kickboxing and karate champion Montu Das. With this, the growth of chessboxing in Asia gained momentum, with the first Chess Boxing Organisation in Western Asia already being built in the following year by another experienced official in the kickboxing world, Fereydoun Pouya, who started the Chess Boxing Organisation Iran.\nAt the same time, the process of making chessboxing a professional discipline reached a milestone: The 2013 World Championship in Moscow was the first chessboxing event organized and marketed by Chess Boxing Global. With three world championship fights in one night, more than 1,200 spectators, and a standard of fighting never seen before, the first CBG event set new standards in the history of chessboxing, with Leonid Chernobaev leading the way. He has been able to make a name for himself with more than fifteen years of chess-playing experience, and in the boxing world as Marco Huck's and Yoan Pablo Hernández's sparring partner, and having fought over 200 amateur bouts. He won the light heavyweight title against Indian fighter Shailesh Tripathi after a technical knockout in the eighth round (boxing). Sven Rooch secured his title in the middleweight class division—winning against Jonatan Rodriguez Vega after the Spaniard resigned in the seventh round (chess), and Russian Nikolay Sazhin won the heavyweight title against Gianluca Sirci by checkmate. Thus, Sazhin (heavyweight), Chernobaev (light heavyweight), and Rooch (middleweight) would all go down in chessboxing history as the first Chess Boxing Global World Champions.\nIn terms of its development into a mass sport, there was much success in 2013 and early 2014 for the chessboxing world. There were more competitors in the second and third Indian Championships in the summer of 2013 and early 2014 than in any chessboxing events ever before, with more than 245 fighters of varying age and weight class, taking place in Salem and Jodhpur, respectively. Furthermore, the chessboxing community in London—under the command of London Chessboxing and the WCBA—has continued to grow constantly since 2011 and by now stages chessboxing events for 800 or more spectators regularly four to five times a year at the Scala, King's Cross.\nLate 2014 also saw the Finnish Chessboxing Club being founded in Helsinki by five members. Since 2013, there has also been a Moscow Chess Boxing club.\n2015–present.\nChessboxing events in 2015 were produced by London Chessboxing under the WCBA—two events at Scala, Kings Cross. The second event, in June 2015, The Grandmaster Bash!, saw the British, European, and IBF light-welterweight world champion Terry Marsh fight and defeat Dymer Agasaryan. Terry Marsh is the first professional boxer to compete in chessboxing and has competed in three fights since June 2014 in London and still remains unbeaten in his career.\nChessboxing has also become more popular among young, poor women in India, where the sport has been seen as an alternative to traditional roles.\nActual numbers of local federations are officially registered in some countries, such as: China, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Iran, Italy, Madagascar, Mexico, Netherlands, Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, USA, and others.\nIn 2016, then-FIDE president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, publicly announced to \"Top Sport\" his desire to include chessboxing in the Olympic games.\nOn 11 December 2022, content creator and YouTuber Ludwig Ahgren held a chess boxing event, called the Mogul Chessboxing Championship, at the Galen Center in Los Angeles. The competition's bouts featured other content creators. The event's live viewership peaked at over 315,000 viewers on YouTube.\nRules.\nA match consists of eleven alternating rounds of chess and boxing, starting and ending with chess. Each boxing round lasts three minutes, followed by a one-minute break. The chess rounds are played under time control, with a total of nine minutes allotted to each player and no increment added to either player's clock after a move is made.\nDecisions.\nA chessboxing match can end by any of the following:\nIf the chess game ends in a draw before the final round, one more round of boxing is held. If this round also ends without a clear victory, the fighter who is ahead on boxing points wins the overall bout. If the chess draw occurs in the final round, the fighter ahead on points is immediately declared the winner. In either case, if the bout ends with both fighters tied on points, the one playing the black chess pieces wins the bout, due to not having the first-move advantage in chess. This scenario has not yet occurred in practice as of 2022.\nWeight classes.\nLike boxing, chessboxers are divided into weight classes. Currently, the following apply to professional chessboxing events of Chess Boxing Global ():\nWomen (17 years+).\nFor amateur and youth chessboxing bouts under the flag of the WCBO, weight classes are graduated in 6-kilo steps. Exceptionally, event hosts can classify into 10-kilo steps.\nParticular requirements and training.\nA chessboxer must have strong skills in both chess and boxing to be permitted to compete in a professional chessboxing fight. The current minimum requirements to fight in a Chess Boxing Global event include an Elo rating of 1,600 and a record of at least fifty amateur bouts fought in boxing or another similar martial art. One deciding factor in chessboxing is that the fighters have to mainly train in speed chess; the skills required by speed chess are different from those for chess using classical time controls. However, chessboxing is not only the ability to master both sports but above all, to be able to withstand the constant switch from a full-contact sport to a thinking game, round after round. After three minutes of boxing, opponents have to face each other at the chessboard barely having taken a break, and have to then perform calmly and think tactically. This switch becomes increasingly hard for the athletes as the contest progresses.\nTo practice these skills, specialized chessboxing training is used, in which physical interval training forms are combined with blitz or speed chess games. Thereby, the fighters adopt the rhythm of a chessboxing bout. They will use exercises like \"track chess\" and \"stair chess\", in which training partners will play an 18-minute game of speed chess over six rounds, with intensive running exercises in between, such as 400-meter sprints or stair sprints. Other common methods of training combine speed chess games with strength exercises such as push-ups. The classic chessboxing training is box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.\nMajor tournaments.\nBelow is a partial list of chess boxing tournaments held in recent years:\nChampions.\nBetween 2003 and 2013, the chessboxing world championships were organized by the WCBO. , they take the form of professional events under the auspices of Chess Boxing Global.\nMajor organizations.\nWorld Chess Boxing Association.\nThe World Chessboxing Association (WCBA) is a legally recognized umbrella organization for chessboxing. It was founded in 2013 and is based in London, England. English heavyweight chessboxing champion Tim Woolgar is its current president. The WCBA originated from the London Chessboxing Club after having separated from the WCBO. It was founded by Woolgar in 2013 to accelerate the development of chessboxing. WCBO champions are also managed and recognized by the WCBA.\nWorld Chess Boxing Organisation.\nThe World Chess Boxing Organisation (WCBO) is the leading umbrella organization for international amateur chessboxing. It is based in Berlin, Germany, and legally recognized as a nonprofit organization by the German government. Iepe Rubingh founded the WCBO directly after the first chessboxing fight in 2003. Its goal is to establish the WCBO as the worldwide organization for the sport of chessboxing. The WCBO aims to collect and link all active chessboxing clubs worldwide under one roof. It was legally recognized as a registered association by Berlin's district court in 2014. The WCBO was the official organizer of the chessboxing world championships until it recognized Chess Boxing Global, following its statute, as the exclusive marketing agent for professional chessboxing fights, in 2013. Chessboxing inventor and WCBO founder Iepe Rubingh is also the current chairman. The first honorary member is comic book artist Enki Bilal, whose comic inspired the invention of chessboxing.\nChessboxing Nation.\nLondon Chessboxing is a brand under which the sport of chessboxing has been promoted since 2008 in London, England. Although the sport has been practised in London since 1978, the home of chessboxing in London today is Islington Boxing Club, where London Chessboxing hosts regular training sessions.\nThe first-ever chessboxing event hosted in the UK under the brand was at Bethnal Green Working Men's club in Hackney by Tim Woolgar on 15 August 2008. Other notable venues include Chelsea Old Town Hall, The Grange Hotel in St Pauls, and the Royal Albert Hall. Their events are hosted at Scala, King's Cross, York Hall, and The Dome, in Tuffnell Park. The events are also broadcast on the livestreaming service Twitch.\nIn 2021 London Chessboxing rebranded as Chessboxing Nation in order to compete with Chessboxing Global; however, Chessboxing Global collapsed following the death of Iepe Rubingh.\nDocumentary.\nIn July 2021, a documentary titled \"By Rook or Left Hook – The Story of Chessboxing\" premiered at the Doc Edge documentary festival in New Zealand, to positive reviews. The film was produced and directed by Canadian filmmaker David Bitton and executive-produced by Ed Cunningham, producer of the gaming documentary \"The King of Kong\". \"By Rook or Left Hook\" tracks the early years of chessboxing, primarily focusing on the tensions that formed between the sport's inventor, Iepe Rubingh, and London Chessboxing founder, Tim Woolgar, and the formation of the two rival governing bodies, the WCBO and the WCBA. Although the documentary was filmed over an eightyear period, (November 2010 to January 2018), the story spans over 21 years—from Rubingh's early years as an artist, all the way up to his death in May 2020.\nChess boxing and science.\nIn parallel with the development of chessboxing as a sport, the discipline has found an increasing place in several works by leading scientists who study the potential application of the concept in various fields.

        "text": "The 2004–05 UEFA Champions League was the 50th season of UEFA's premier European club football tournament, and the 13th since it was rebranded as the UEFA Champions League in 1992. The competition was won by Liverpool, who beat Milan on penalties in the final, having come back from 3–0 down at half-time. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was named as UEFA's Footballer of the Year for his key role in the final and throughout the Champions League season. The final, played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, is often regarded as one of the best in the history of the tournament.\nAs it was their fifth European Cup title, Liverpool were awarded the trophy permanently, and received the UEFA Badge of Honour.

        "title": "Lebanon men's national basketball team",
        "text": " \nThe Lebanon men's national basketball team (; ), controlled by the Lebanese Basketball Federation (FLB), has represented Lebanon in basketball since its inception in 1947. The squad is governed by FIBA, and is part of the FIBA Asia zone.\nThroughout its history, Lebanon has achieved success, finishing as runners-up in the FIBA Asia Cup on four occasions: 2001, 2005, 2007, and most recently in 2022. The team has also made appearances in the FIBA World Championship on four occasions (2002, 2006, 2010, and 2023) but haven't progressed beyond the preliminary round.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nBasketball arrived in Lebanon in the mid-1920s, initially introduced at the American University of Beirut. The official organization of basketball in the country began in 1949 with the establishment of the Lebanese Basketball Federation (). This period also saw the founding of the Lebanese Volleyball Federation, marking a key moment for Lebanese sports development.\nThe early years of international competition for Lebanon involved a unique approach. The Soviet Union's refusal to host Eurobasket 1949 and FIBA Europe's decision not to ask Czechoslovakia to host consecutive tournaments led to Egypt, the Eurobasket 1947 bronze medalist, hosting the competition. Due to travel challenges and concerns, few European teams participated. In an unconventional move, Lebanon and Syria, both Asian countries, were invited to participate in this European championship. Making their Eurobasket 1949 debut, Lebanon finished in seventh place after losing all six games in the seven-team round-robin format.\nThe team's second attempt at the European competition came at the Eurobasket 1953 in Moscow. During the preliminary rounds, Lebanon lost all four games, including one by forfeit due to their decision not to play against Israel. Their first victory in the tournament came against Sweden in the classification round, marking a significant milestone as Lebanon's first win in Eurobasket history. Placing fourth in their five-team group, Lebanon advanced to the 13–16 classification games. While they narrowly lost to West Germany (58–56), they secured a victory over Denmark (74–40), ultimately finishing 15th out of the 17 participating teams.\n2000–2010: Three-time Asian runners-up and World Cup Appearances.\nLebanon achieved notable results in the early 2000s, solidifying their presence in the Asian basketball landscape. They finished second at the 2001 ABC Championship after a 63–97 loss to China in the final. The tournament showcased the skills of Lebanon's guard, Walid Doumiati, who was awarded the tournament's Best Playmaker. Alongside him, forward Fadi El Khatib also earned a spot on the All-Star Five lineup. This silver medal secured Lebanon's participation in the 2002 FIBA World Championship, though their journey ended in the first round of the tournament.\nLebanon repeated their performance by reaching the finals again at the 2005 FIBA Asia Championship. However, their attempt to win the championship was unsuccessful against China, with Lebanon losing 61–77. Fadi El Khatib's performance earned him recognition as the tournament's Best Forward. Additionally, center Joe Vogel also secured a spot in the All-Star Five lineup. Finishing as runners-up granted Lebanon a ticket to the 2006 FIBA World Championship. Although the team secured victories against Venezuela (82–72) and France (74–73), they narrowly missed qualifying for the round of 16 in the World Championship.\nThe following year, Lebanon achieved second place for the third time at the 2007 FIBA Asia Championship, facing a 74–69 loss to Iran in the final. This loss prevented Lebanon from qualifying for the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nAt the 2009 FIBA Asia Championship, Lebanon's reached the semifinals. Although they fell short of automatic qualification for the 2010 FIBA World Championship after losses to China and Jordan, Lebanon received a wildcard entry, securing their third consecutive World Cup appearance. Despite a victory against Canada (81–71), Lebanon couldn't progress beyond the group stage in the 2010 FIBA World Championship.\n2013 FIBA suspension.\nLebanon encountered a difficult period in July 2013 when the International Basketball Federation FIBA imposed an indefinite suspension. This suspension resulted from unresolved internal conflicts within the Lebanese Basketball Federation. Consequently, FIBA Asia suspended Lebanon from participating in all sanctioned events, effectively barring the country from international competitions until further notice.\nThe suspension had significant consequences, particularly impacting Lebanon's participation in the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship. This tournament served as a qualifying event for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. Despite securing a spot in the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship based on their second-place finish in the 2013 West Asian Basketball Championship, the national federation's suspension led to their exclusion from the tournament.\nFollowing discussions and appeals, FIBA lifted the ban in May 2014, allowing Lebanon's national team to return to international basketball competitions.\n2020–present: Asian runners-up and return to the World Cup.\nLebanon displayed a significant resurgence in international basketball, culminating in a noteworthy performance at the 2022 FIBA Asia Cup, marking their return to the finals in over a decade. Despite a close contest, Lebanon finished in second place after a narrow 73–75 defeat to Australia. This marked Lebanon's fourth silver medal at the FIBA Asia Cup, adding to their previous runner-up finishes in 2001, 2005, and 2007. The tournament also highlighted the performance of Lebanon's point guard, Wael Arakji, who earned the tournament MVP title, best guard, and a spot on the All-Star Five.\nBuilding on this success, Lebanon continued their journey by securing qualification for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. Despite facing a challenging first round with three losses, Lebanon demonstrated determination, closing their World Cup campaign with consecutive victories. They secured wins against Ivory Coast (94–84) and Iran (81–73), during the classification round, concluding their World Cup appearance on a high note.\nLebanon finished 23rd in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, qualifying them for the 2024 FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments. These tournaments will involve twenty-four teams competing for the final four spots at the 2024 Summer Olympics basketball tournament.\nCompetitive record.\nFIBA Asia Challenge.\nThe FIBA Asia Challenge, a basketball tournament held every two years for Asian national teams, was previously known as the FIBA Asia Stanković Cup (2004-2010) and FIBA Asia Cup (2012-2014). Lebanon participated in the tournament twice (2010 and 2012) and emerged victorious in 2010. This championship win granted them automatic qualification for the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n \n \n "

        "text": "David Grover Stacey Wingate, Jr. (born December 15, 1963) is an American former professional basketball player. The shooting guard-small forward spent 15 years in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with six teams.\nHigh school and college career.\nWingate played high school basketball for the Dunbar Poets of Dunbar High School, where he played alongside fellow NBA players Muggsy Bogues, Reggie Lewis, and Reggie Williams. The 1981–82 Poets finished the season at 29–0, and the following year, after Wingate's graduation, finished 31–0 and were ranked first in the nation by \"USA Today\". At the end of his senior season, it was expected Wingate would attend the University of Maryland, but instead he decided to attend Georgetown University.\nAs a freshman for the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team during the 1982–83 season, Wingate was named to the Big East Conference all-rookie team. The following season, he made the transition from a guard-forward hybrid to playing primarily at the shooting guard position, as the small forward position was filled be incoming freshman and fellow Dunbar alum Reggie Williams. During his sophomore year, Wingate led the team in steals and scored about 11 points per game, en route to Georgetown winning the 1984 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Wingate's junior season saw Georgetown miss repeating as national champions, losing to Villanova University in the final of the 1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. It also was one of Wingate's best defensive seasons, earning career-high totals in assists and steals, and leading the team with 16 points in their championship match-up against Villanova. He averaged 16 points a game in his senior year, trailing only Williams, and played 1,000 minutes without fouling out. Upon graduation, Wingate was the Hoyas' third all-time leading scorer behind Eric Floyd and Patrick Ewing.\nProfessional career.\nWingate had a 15-year NBA career spanning from 1986 to 2001. He was selected in the second round with the 44th pick of the 1986 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. His selection in the second round surprised some, with 76ers coach Matt Guokas saying, \"In a lot of people's eyes, he was a first-round pick\" and that he was \"one of the people we would have considered\" had they not traded their first-round pick. After fighting for a spot on the 76ers roster, Wingate made his debut on November 2, 1986. He played nine minutes in his debut against the Atlanta Hawks, and made his first start against the Cleveland Cavaliers on March 10, 1987, scoring 22 points in 46 minutes. He finished the season having played in 77 games, averaging two assists and 8.8 points per game.\nHe played for the San Antonio Spurs, Washington Bullets, Charlotte Hornets, Seattle SuperSonics and New York Knicks. Wingate retired with the Sonics in 2001, after having played a total of 28 games in his final three NBA seasons.\nPersonal life.\nWingate has five children: Cynthia Alixandra, Brandi Allstin, Davion, Ashley and Aminah"

Then, he embarked on a head coaching career, as he served as the head coach at the University of Tulsa (1977–1984), Arizona State University (1985–1987), and Ohio State University (1988–2000), compiling a career record of 192–84–6.\nEarly years and playing career.\nCooper was born and raised in the Knoxville suburb of Powell, Tennessee. He graduated from Powell High School in 1955, then served in the United States Army for two years. After serving for two years, he enrolled at Iowa State University, where he played football for legendary coach Clay Stapleton in the single-wing formation with the Iowa State Cyclones, including the 1959 \"Dirty 30\" team. As a senior in 1961, Cooper was team captain and MVP. Cooper graduated from Iowa State in 1962 with a bachelor's degree in physical education.\nCoaching career.\nCooper began his coaching career in 1962 as the freshmen team coach at Iowa State. He then was an assistant coach at Oregon State from 1963 to 1964 under Tommy Prothro and helped Oregon State finish first place in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) in 1964. Oregon State also made the Rose Bowl and finished #8 in the final AP Poll. Cooper then followed Prothro to UCLA to be an assistant there from 1965 to 1966. In the 1965 season, UCLA finished first in the AAWU and #4 in the final AP Poll and won the Rose Bowl. The 1966 UCLA team finished #5 in the AP Poll.\nIn 1967, Cooper became defensive coordinator at Kansas under Pepper Rodgers. Cooper again was part of a conference championship team in 1968 when Kansas finished first in the Big 12. The 1968 Kansas team finished #9 in the final AP Poll and made the Orange Bowl. Cooper remained at Kansas until 1971. From 1972 to 1976, Cooper had his final assistant position at Kentucky, first under John Ray in 1972 then Fran Curci from 1973 to 1976. In Cooper's final season at Kentucky in 1976, Kentucky finished #18 in the AP Poll and won the Peach Bowl.\nIn 1977, he was named the head football coach at the University of Tulsa. At Tulsa, he compiled a 56–32 record with five Missouri Valley Conference titles. Cooper considers his tenure at Tulsa his \"most enjoyable years as a coach\". He became the head coach at Arizona State in 1985 where his teams played in three consecutive bowl games, including the 1987 Rose Bowl, during his three-year tenure. His record was 0–2–1 against arch-rival Arizona. He accepted the job as head coach at Ohio State on December 31, 1987.\nCooper's first season in Columbus was somewhat undistinguished; the Buckeyes notched their first losing season since 1966. However, he quickly turned the Buckeyes around and led them to shared Big Ten titles in 1993, 1996, and 1998. In his 13 seasons at Ohio State, Cooper compiled a 111–43–4 record; his 111 victories are second in Ohio State history behind only Woody Hayes's 205. Among his most memorable victories at Ohio State were back-to-back victories against Notre Dame (1995 and 1996), leading Ohio State to its first Rose Bowl in 13 years (the 1997 Rose Bowl—a win over Arizona State), and a 1999 Sugar Bowl victory over Texas A&amp;M. Cooper's teams at Ohio State were loaded with a great deal of talent that would go on to play in the NFL, including: 1995 Heisman Trophy winner Eddie George, 1995 Fred Biletnikoff Award winner Terry Glenn, 1996 Outland Trophy winner Orlando Pace, 1997 Butkus Award winner Andy Katzenmoyer, 1998 Jim Thorpe Award winner Antoine Winfield, as well as Alonzo Spellman, Robert Smith, Dan Wilkinson, Joey Galloway, Rickey Dudley, Mike Vrabel, Korey Stringer, David Boston, Shawn Springs, Ahmed Plummer, Na'il Diggs, Nate Clements, and Ryan Pickett.\nHowever, Cooper has also been remembered for his 3–8 bowl record and his 2–10–1 record against archrival Michigan. His most disappointing losses to the Wolverines came in 1993, 1995, and 1996. In each season of those seasons, Ohio State entered the Michigan game undefeated and ranked in the top five, but were upset by the Wolverines on each occasion; two of those losses cost the Buckeyes a Rose Bowl bid. In 1993 Ohio State was ranked #5 and undefeated, needing only to beat Michigan to get their first trip to Pasadena in nine years. However, they were shut out by the unranked Wolverines 28–0 in Ann Arbor. In 1995 Ohio State lost a #2 ranking, the Big Ten title, and another shot at the Rose Bowl by losing to the #18 ranked Wolverines, 31–23, in Ann Arbor. In 1996, the Buckeyes were again ranked #2 and had already secured a Rose Bowl berth when they faced #21 ranked Michigan, this time in Columbus. The Buckeyes smelled victory after shutting out the Wolverines in the first half, but Michigan rallied in the second half to upset the Buckeyes yet again, 13–9, costing them a chance at the national championship. Ohio State would go on to win the 1997 Rose Bowl against Arizona State and finish the season ranked #2. With this victory, Cooper became the first coach to win the Rose Bowl with a Pac-10 and a Big Ten team.\nIn 1997, top ranked Michigan entered the game undefeated and #4 Ohio State had the opportunity to spoil Michigan's perfect season; however, the Wolverines again defeated the Buckeyes, 20–14. To add insult to injury, Michigan's win was highlighted by the performance of Ohio native and 1997 Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson, who made game changing plays on offense, defense, and special teams.\nIn 1998, Ohio State was 8–0 and ranked #1 in the country but was upset by Michigan State, 28–24. They did go on to beat Michigan that season and won the Sugar Bowl over Texas A&amp;M, 24–14, eventually finishing #2 in the polls.\nCooper's Buckeyes were expected to have a strong season in 1999, but slumped to 6–6, their first non-winning record since Cooper's first year and only their third since 1947. They rebounded to 8–4 a year later, but a 38–26 loss to Michigan cost Cooper his job at the end of the season. He was the first non-interim Buckeye head coach since Wes Fesler, Hayes' predecessor, to have left Ohio State without winning an outright Big Ten title.\nLater life and honors.\nCooper currently works for the Cincinnati Bengals of the NFL as a scouting consultant and also works as a college football analyst for ESPN.\nOn May 1, 2008, Cooper was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame on December 30, 2012, representing both Arizona State and Ohio State football teams. On September 8, 2014, Cooper was inducted into the Iowa State University Athletics Hall of Fame in an on-field ceremony during the Iowa State-Kansas State football game."

        "text": "The Connecticut Open was a professional tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts under various names and in various venues from 1948 until 2019. \nIt was most recently a Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Premier Tournament on the WTA Tour, held annually at the Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center in New Haven, Connecticut, United States, just before the fourth and last Grand Slam tournament of the year, the US Open. From 2005 through 2010, the tournament was also part of the ATP World Tour 250 series of the ATP Tour.\nIn 2019, the tournament sanction was sold to APG, a sports and entertainment company, which transferred it to Zhengzhou, China.\nHistory.\nThe tournament was created in 1948 as the U.S. Women's Hardcourt Championships and first played in Sacramento, California, in the United States. Over the 20 years of its first run, the event was held in various locations in the western United States: San Francisco; Berkeley, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; Seattle, Washington; La Jolla, California; and Denver, Colorado. Among the winners of the event were Doris Hart, Darlene Hard, Nancy Richey, Rosemary Casals, Billie Jean King, and Jane Bartkowicz. The event was discontinued in 1969 after the beginning of the Open Era.\nIn 1988, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) reinstated the tournament. The first edition of the new U.S. Women's Hardcourt Championships was held that year in San Antonio, Texas, first as part of Tier IV of the WTA Tour, then as an upgraded Tier III event in 1990. The championships were sponsored by Post Cereals in 1990 and by Acura from 1992 to 1994. Over the first years of its second run, the tournament was won by several past or future World No. 1s, including Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, and Martina Navratilova. The event was held in Stratton Mountain, Vermont, in 1993 and 1994, but conflicts with the 1996 Summer Olympics prevented the tournament from being held the following two years. In 1997, the event returned again, now within Tier II and first in Stone Mountain, Georgia, then settling in 1998 in New Haven, Connecticut, under the new sponsorship of Pilot Pen. In the first years of its run in New Haven, the renamed Pilot Pen International saw its competition dominated by Lindsay Davenport (four-time runner-up in New Haven, one previous time in Stone Mountain, and 2005 champion) and Venus Williams (four-time champion from 1999 to 2002).\nNew Haven was already host to a men's tournament, the Pilot Pen International\".\" It was created in 1973 in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, as the Volvo International, and moved to Connecticut in 1990, where it took Pilot Pen sponsorship in 1997. When the men's event was cancelled in 1999, the women's Pilot Pen tournament remained the only one of the region.\nIn 2005, the USTA purchased the men's tournament of Long Island, New York, and merged it with the women's Pilot Pen International to create Pilot Pen Tennis\",\" the first large joint ATP–WTA tournament leading to the US Open. The tournament became the last event of the US Open Series and continued to attract top players, including champions Caroline Wozniacki, Svetlana Kuznetsova, James Blake, Justine Henin, and Nikolay Davydenko.\nIn 2011, after the men's competition moved to Winston-Salem, the newly women's-only event was renamed the New Haven Open at Yale\".\" In 2014, it was renamed the Connecticut Open.\nIn 2019, the Connecticut Open ended due to a lack of funding. The tournament's sanction was sold and assigned to Zhengzhou, China, after the 2019 US Open. In 2021, the Tennis in the Land tournament in Cleveland took over its former spot on the WTA schedule.\n2011 earthquake.\nOn August 23, 2011, 1:51 PM local time a 5.8 magnitude earthquake in Virginia stopped play for two hours while the main stadium was checked for damage by the fire department."

The tournament takes place under the patronage of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. In 2001 the ATP upgraded the tournament from an ATP 250 level to the more prestigious ATP 500 level tournament. On the WTA Tour, it alternated yearly between a WTA 1000 level tournament and a WTA 500 level tournament, until 2024, when it remained a WTA 1000 event from the prior year. Prior to the 1990s there was an annual Dubai Tennis Championship played at the British Embassy.\nThe Dubai Tennis Championships was the third tournament in pro tennis history to award equal prize money for both men and women, until 2021.\nThe courts usually have a medium-fast speed considered to be similar in speed to the Shanghai and Swiss Indoor (Basel) courts.\nHistory.\nThe Dubai Tennis Championships debuted at the Aviation Club in 1993 as an ATP 250 tournament. At the time there was no formal stadium and the tournament was hosted on hardcourts surrounded by temporary scaffold seating to host a total of 3000 viewers across all courts.\nIn 1996, the Dubai Tennis Championships took place at the newly erected Dubai Tennis Stadium at the Aviation Club. The construction of the Dubai Tennis Stadium also led to the development of various food &amp; beverage entertainment locations in and around the stadium base, like the Irish and Century Villages. In 2012, a 293-bedroom hotel was constructed on-site that hosts many of the players and officials during the 2 week event.\nThe inaugural ATP men's tournament was won by Karel Nováček in 1993 who was ranked world number 23 at the time. The inaugural WTA women's tournament debuted in 2001 as a Premier tournament and was won by Martina Hingis.\nFor five years, Swiss Roger Federer, on the men's side, and Belgian Justine Henin, on the women's side, dominated the singles' tournaments. Between 2003 and 2007, Federer and Henin each won the singles title four times. However, in 2008, neither player managed to reach the finals; Andy Roddick and Elena Dementieva became the new champions.\nIn 2005, the Dubai Tennis Championships implemented equal prize money policy becoming the third professional tennis event to do so after the US Open and Australian Open.\n2009 Shahar Pe'er visa controversy.\nIn February 2009, Israeli player Shahar Pe'er was denied an entry visa by the United Arab Emirates, a country that did not have diplomatic relations with Israel at the time. Tournament director Salah Tahlak said that Pe'er was refused on the grounds that her appearance could incite anger in the Arab country, after she had already faced protests earlier at the ASB Classic over the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict. A number of top-seeded players, among them Venus Williams, condemned the action not to grant Pe'er a visa.\nIn response, the Dubai Tennis Championship was fined a record US$300,000. The fine was appealed by DTC, but the WTA Tour Board rejected the appeal. Pe'er was awarded a guarantee to enter the next (2010) edition of the event, plus US$44,250, an amount equal to the average prize money she earned per tournament in 2008. A number of highly ranked tennis players, including 2008 winner Andy Roddick, pulled out of the men's event (ATP 500 Dubai) which was scheduled to take place the week after the women's event. As a result, the UAE issued Israeli Andy Ram a visa for the men's tournament.\nPast finals.\nIn the men's singles, Roger Federer (winner in 2003–05, 2007, 2012, 2014–15, 2019, runner-up in 2006, 2011) holds the records for most titles (eight), most finals (ten), and most consecutive titles (three), sharing the last record with Novak Djokovic (winner in 2009–11, 2013, 2020, runner-up in 2015). In the women's singles, Justine Henin (2003–04, 2006–07) holds the record for most titles (four) and shares with Venus Williams (2009–10, 2014) and Elina Svitolina (2017–18) the record for most consecutive titles (two). In men's doubles, Mahesh Bhupathi (1998, 2004, 2008, 2012–13) has won the most overall titles (five), and co-holds with Grant Connell (1995–96) the record for most consecutive titles (two). In women's doubles, Liezel Huber (2007–09, 2011–12) took the most titles (five) and, alongside partner Cara Black (2007–09), the most back-to-back titles (three)."

The contestant who can spit the cricket the farthest is declared the winner.\nCricket-spitting was developed in 1996 by entomologist Tom Turpin at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, as a competition for their annual Bug Bowl event, which brings over 30,000 people per year to their campus for a series of insect-related events and competitions. Since its creation, other universities have begun their own competitions, such as Pennsylvania State University who have hosted their own 'spit-off' since 1998. A Scottish spin off of Cricket-Spitting is Wasp Waving, where contestants throw frozen wasps at a target while blind folded.\nWorld record.\nThe Guinness World Record for cricket-spitting is and is held by Dan Capps, from Madison, Wisconsin, and was set in June 1998 in front of a live television audience. \nRobert Tony Ferrell, from Hoopeston, Illinois, held the title/record in the 1997 Bug Bowl Games until upset by Dan Capps.

        "title": "List of England Test cricket records",
        "text": "Test cricket is the oldest form of cricket played at international level. A Test match is scheduled to take place over a period of five days, and is played by teams representing full member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC). England was a founding member of the ICC, having played the first Test match against Australia in March 1877 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. , they have played more Test matches than any other team, and of their 1,059 games, have won 388, drawn 354 and lost 317. With 36.63 per cent of matches won, this makes England the third most successful team in the history of Test cricket, behind Australia on 47.47 per cent and South Africa on 38.20 per cent.\nOpening batsman and former captain Alastair Cook holds several England Test cricket records. Playing between 2006 and 2018, he scored 12,472 runs, making him the first England player to score 10,000 Test runs. He scored a record 57 half-centuries and 33 centuries. As a slip fielder, Cook has also taken the most catches for England with 175 and holds the England record for the most catches taken in a Test series with 13. Cook also holds the Test record for the most consecutive matches played with 159.\nThe most successful Test wicket-taker for England is James Anderson, who made his Test debut in 2003 and is currently still active. , he has played in a total of 180+ Test matches and taken a record 700 wickets for a fast bowler at Test level, both records for England. He has also picked up five wickets in an innings on 32 occasions, which is the most for the national side. The corresponding record for taking ten wickets in a match is held by Sydney Barnes, who achieved this feat seven times. He also holds the Test record for the most wickets taken in a series, having removed members of the opposing side 49 times during the England tour of South Africa in 1913–14. Alan Knott is England's most successful wicket-keeper, having taken 269 dismissals. England claims two age records: James Southerton as the oldest player to make his Test debut, at 49, and Wilfred Rhodes, aged 52, as the oldest cricketer to ever play in a Test match.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses and draws and the partnership records. Tied records for fifth place are also included. Explanations of the general symbols and cricketing terms used in the list are given below. Specific details are provided in each category where appropriate. All records include matches played for England only, and are correct .\nTeam records.\nTeam wins, losses and draws.\n, England have played 1,071 Test matches resulting in 392 victories, 324 defeats and 355 draws for an overall winning percentage of 36.60, the third highest winning percentage of Test playing teams. England has played the highest number of Test matches, ahead of Australia which has competed in 851. England is undefeated against Ireland and has defeated Bangladesh on all but one occasion. England played the debut Test matches of Australia, India, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies – winning all of them except against Australia.\nTeam scoring records.\nMost runs in an innings.\nThe highest innings total scored in Test cricket came in the series between Sri Lanka and India in August 1997. Playing in the first Test at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, the hosts posted a first innings total of 952/6d. This broke the longstanding record of 903/7d which England set against Australia in the final Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The Oval. This in turn broke England's 849 all out against the West Indies in 1930.\nHighest successful run chases.\nThe highest successful run chase came in the West Indies victory over Australia in May 2003 at the Antigua Recreation Ground. Set 418 for victory in the final innings, the hosts achieved the target for the loss of seven wickets. England's highest successful chase came in the fifth Test of the 2021 series against India at Edgbaston (held over until 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). England reached the target of 378 runs with seven wickets in hand, having successfully chased a target of over 300 runs in Test matches on only four previous occasions.\nFewest runs in an innings.\nThe lowest innings total scored in Test cricket came in the second Test of England's tour of New Zealand in March 1955. Trailing England by 46, New Zealand were bowled out in their second innings for 26 runs. The equal twelfth-lowest score in Test history is England's total of 45 scored in their first innings against Australia in the first Test of the 1886–87 Ashes series.\nResult records.\nA Test match is won when one side has scored more runs than the total runs scored by the opposing side during their two innings. If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by an innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nGreatest win margins (by innings).\nThe fifth Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The Oval saw England win by an innings and 579 runs, the largest victory by an innings in Test cricket history.

This match saw the hosts achieving their highest successful run chase in Test cricket of 359 runs, one of only fourteen one-wicket victories in Test cricket.\nGreatest loss margins (by innings).\nEngland suffered their greatest defeat by an innings at The Gabba in the first Test of the 1946–47 Ashes series, the first Test match to be played in Australia after the Second World War. Going down to the hosts by an innings and 332 runs, this is the fourth-heaviest defeat in Test cricket history.\nGreatest loss margins (by runs).\nThe first Test of the 1928–29 Ashes series saw Australia defeated by England by 675 runs, the greatest losing margin by runs in Test cricket. The results were reversed in the fifth and final Test of the 1934 Ashes series at The Oval where the tourists defeated the hosts by 562 runs, England's greatest defeat by runs.\nGreatest loss margins (by 10 wickets).\nEngland have lost a Test match by a margin of 10 wickets on 25 occasions, more than any other Test playing team.\nNarrowest loss margins (by runs).\nOnly two matches in years of Test cricket has been decided by a margin of one run.

England had made New Zealand follow-on, but a second innings of 483 from the home team set a target of 257. This was also only the fourth time that a team made to follow-on had won a Test.\nNarrowest loss margins (by wickets).\nTest cricket has seen fourteen matches decided by a margin of one wicket, with England being defeated in one of them. The first Test of the 1905–06 series against South Africa at Old Wanderers saw the home side chase down the target of 284 runs in the final innings.\nIndividual records.\nBatting records.\nMost career runs.\nA run is the basic means of scoring in cricket.

Wally Hammond's 336, scored against New Zealand in 1933, is the third highest not out Test innings and the ninth highest overall. Hutton's, Hammond's and Andy Sandham's 325 against the West Indies in 1930 were Test record scores at the time they were scored.\nHighest career average.\nA batsman's batting average is the total number of runs they have scored divided by the number of times they have been dismissed.\nAustralia's Don Bradman, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time, finished his Test career with an average of 99.94. With 60.73, Herbert Sutcliffe is one of only five batsmen to finish his international career with an average above 60.\nMost half-centuries.\nA half-century is a score of between 50 and 99 runs.

Five England players have scored a single Test triple century with former captain Graham Gooch the most recent to do so in 1990, .\nMost runs in a series.\nThe 1930 Ashes series in England saw Bradman set the record for the most runs scored in a single series, falling just 26 short of 1,000 runs. He is followed by Wally Hammond with 905 runs scored in the 1928–29 Ashes series. Alastair Cook's 766 runs scored during the 2010–11 Ashes series ranks in 14th.\nMost ducks.\nA duck refers to a batsman being dismissed without scoring a run. Former West Indian fast bowler Courtney Walsh has scored the highest number of ducks in Test cricket with 43 followed by England's Stuart Broad with 39. James Anderson, with 31 scoreless innings, is eighth on the list.\nBowling records.\nMost career wickets.\nA bowler takes the wicket of a batsman when the form of dismissal is bowled, caught, leg before wicket, stumped or hit wicket.

Billy Barnes is third on the list, finishing his Test career with an average of 15.54.\nBest career strike rate.\nA bowler's strike rate is the total number of balls they have bowled divided by the number of wickets they have taken.\nAs with the career average above, the top two bowlers with the best Test career strike rate are George Lohmann and J. J. Ferris, with Lohmann on 34.1 and Ferris with an overall career strike rate of 37.7 balls per wicket.\nBest career economy rate.\nA bowler's economy rate is the total number of runs they have conceded divided by the number of overs they have bowled.\nEnglish bowler William Attewell, who played 10 Tests between 1884 and 1892, holds the Test record for the best career economy rate with 1.31. Cliff Gladwin, with a rate of 1.60 runs per over conceded over his 8-match Test career, is second on the list.\nMost five-wicket hauls in an innings.\nA five-wicket haul refers to a bowler taking five wickets in a single innings.\nSri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan has taken the most five-wicket hauls in Test cricket with 67 throughout his career followed by Shane Warne achieving 37.

English paceman Sydney Barnes played in four of the five matches and achieved a total of 49 wickets to his name. Jim Laker sits second on the list with 46 wickets taken during the 1956 Ashes series.\nWicket-keeping records.\nThe wicket-keeper is a specialist fielder who stands behind the stumps being guarded by the batsman on strike and is the only member of the fielding side allowed to wear gloves and leg pads.\nMost career dismissals.\nA wicket-keeper can be credited with the dismissal of a batsman in two ways, caught or stumped. A fair catch is taken when the ball is caught fully within the field of play without it bouncing after the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat, while a stumping occurs when the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket while the batsman is out of his ground and not attempting a run.\nSouth Africa's Mark Boucher has taken the most dismissals in Test cricket as a designated wicket-keeper with 555, followed by Adam Gilchrist of Australia on 416. England's Alan Knott, who took 269 dismissals during his 95-Test match career, is eighth on the list. He is followed by his compatriots Matt Prior and Alec Stewart in tenth and eleventh with 256 and 241 dismissals respectively.\nMost career catches.\nBoucher also leads Gilchrist in the number of catches taken as a designated wicket-keeper in Test cricket, 532 to 379. Alan Knott, with 250 catches to his name is ninth on this list. He is again followed by Prior and Stewart in tenth and eleventh with 243 and 227 catches respectively.\nMost career stumpings.\nAustralia's Bert Oldfield holds the record for the most stumpings in Test cricket with 52. He is followed by Godfrey Evans of England with 46 to his name.\nMost dismissals in an innings.\nFour wicket-keepers have taken seven dismissals in a single innings in a Test match—Wasim Bari of Pakistan in 1979, Englishman Bob Taylor in 1980, New Zealand's Ian Smith in 1991 and most recently West Indian gloveman Ridley Jacobs against Australia in 2000.\nThe feat of taking 6 dismissals in an innings has been achieved by 25 wicket-keepers on 33 occasions including 7 Englishmen on 11 occasions.\nMost dismissals in a series.\nBrad Haddin holds the Test cricket record for the most dismissals taken by a wicket-keeper in a series. He took 29 catches during the 2013 Ashes series which broke the previous record held by fellow Australian Rod Marsh when he took 28 catches in the 1982–83 Ashes series. Jack Russell of England is equal third with 27 dismissals taken during the 1995–96 tour of South Africa.\nFielding records.\nMost career catches.\nCaught is one of the nine methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket. A fair catch is defined as a fielder catching the ball, from a legal delivery, fully within the field of play without it bouncing when the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat. The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen.\nIndia's Rahul Dravid holds the record for the most catches in Test cricket by a non-wicket-keeper with 210, followed by Mahela Jayawardene of Sri Lanka on 205 and South African Jacques Kallis with 200. Former captain Joe Root is the highest ranked England player in fifth, securing 193 catches in his Test career.\nMost catches in a series.\nThe 1920–21 Ashes series, in which Australia whitewashed England 5–0 for the first time, saw the record set for the most catches taken by a non-wicket-keeper in a Test series. Australian all-rounder Jack Gregory took 15 catches in the series as well as 23 wickets. Greg Chappell and KL Rahul are joint second behind Gregory with 14 catches taken during the 1974–75 Ashes series and the 2018 India tour of England respectively. The same series saw Alastair Cook become the highest placed England player in equal fourth with 13 catches taken alongside Bob Simpson, Brian Lara and Rahul Dravid.\nOther records.\nMost career matches.\nIndia's Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the most Test matches played with 200, with James Anderson in second with 183 caps . Former captains Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh are joint third with each having represented Australia on 168 occasions. Anderson is one of 15 cricketers to have played 100 Tests for England.\nMost consecutive career matches.\nFormer English captain Alastair Cook holds the record for the most consecutive Test matches played with 159. Cook equalled the previous record of 153, set by Australia's Allan Border, during the first Test of the two-match series against Pakistan in May 2018 and broke it by playing in the second Test of the same series. Former English skipper Joe Root brought his run of 77 consecutive Tests to an end when he missed the first Test against the West Indies in July 2020, due to the birth of his second child.\nMost matches as captain.\nGraeme Smith, who led the South African cricket team from 2003 to 2014, holds the record for the most matches played as captain in Test cricket with 109. Allan Border, who skippered Australia from 1984 to 1994 is second with 93 matches. Joe Root, is seventh on the list with 64 matches .\nYoungest players.\nThe youngest player to play in a Test match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 227 days. Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 24 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time. The youngest cricketer to play Test cricket for England was Rehan Ahmed who was 18 years and 126 days old when he debuted in the third Test of the series against Pakistan in December 2022.\nOldest players on debut.\nAt 49 years and 119 days, James Southerton of England, playing in the very first Test match in March 1877, is the oldest player to make his debut in Test cricket. Second on the list is Miran Bakhsh of Pakistan who at 47 years and 284 days made his debut against India in 1955.\nOldest players.\nEngland all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes is the oldest player to appear in a Test match. Playing in the fourth Test against the West Indies in 1930 at Sabina Park, in Kingston, Jamaica, he was aged 52 years and 165 days on the final day's play. The second-oldest Test player is Bert Ironmonger who was aged 50 years and 327 days when he represented Australia for the final time in the fifth Test of the 1932–33 Ashes series at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nEnglish batsmen hold three Test wicket partnerships records, all set since 2010. Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow came together in the second Test of the 2015–16 series against South Africa at Newlands Cricket Ground and put together a sixth wicket partnership of 399 runs. The pair of Jonathan Trott and Stuart Broad set the highest eighth wicket partnership of 332 runs at Lord's in August 2010 against Pakistan. Finally, the tenth wicket partnership of 198 was made by Joe Root and James Anderson in the first Test against India at Trent Bridge in July 2014.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest Test partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the Sri Lankan pairing of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene who put together a third wicket partnership of 624 runs during the first Test against South Africa in July 2006. This broke the record of 576 runs set by their compatriots Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanama against India in 1997. New Zealand's Andrew Jones and Martin Crowe hold the third-highest Test partnership with 467 made in 1991 against Sri Lanka. The English pairing of Peter May and Colin Cowdrey together scored 411 for the fourth wicket against the West Indies in 1957 to place themselves thirteenth on the list.\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nAleem Dar of Pakistan holds the record for the most Test matches umpired with 145, . The currently active Dar set the record in December 2019 overtaking West Indian Steve Bucknor's mark of 128 matches. They are followed by South Africa's Rudi Koertzen who officiated in 108. The most experienced Englishman is David Shepherd who is fifth on the list with 92 Test matches umpired. Dickie Bird, who previously held the record with 66 Tests, is currently sixteenth ."

He spent his entire career with the Brooklyn Superbas in the National League.\nCareer.\nLumley was born in Forest City, Pennsylvania, in 1880. In 1901, he started his professional baseball career with Rome of the New York State League. He batted .350. The following season, he played for St. Paul of the American Association and led the league with 18 home runs. In 1903, Lumley joined Seattle of the Pacific Coast League and led the league with a .387 batting average. After the season, he was drafted by the Superbas.\nIn Lumley's first major league season, he batted .279 for Brooklyn and led the NL with nine home runs and 18 triples. Since then, only one other first-year player (Ralph Kiner in 1946) has led his league in home runs.\nHe then batted .293 in 1905. In 1906, he batted .324 with nine home runs and 12 triples. In 1907, he batted .267 with nine home runs. Suffering from an ankle injury, Lumley struggled in 1908 and finished with a batting average of .216. He was named Brooklyn's manager for 1909. That year, he appeared in 55 games as a player and batted .250 with no home runs. The Superbas had a record of 55–98, and Lumley was replaced as manager before the 1910 season.

        "text": "Clarence Stephen \"Steve\" Johnson (born November 3, 1957) is an American former professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played the power forward and center positions.\nCollegiate career.\nJohnson played collegiately at Oregon State University under Naismith Hall of Fame coach Ralph Miller. He was the star player on the 1980–81 team (known as the Orange Express) which reached as high as no. 1 in the national rankings, before being upset in the second round of the 1981 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament by eighth-seeded Kansas State. That season, Johnson made 235 of 315 field goals for a field goal percentage of .746, a single-season mark which was an NCAA men's basketball record until March 16, 2017, when Devontae Cacok of UNCW finished with a field goal percentage of .800 of 230 shots.\nProfessional career.\nHe was drafted the following summer, with the seventh pick overall, by the Kansas City Kings in the 1981 NBA draft, and played with the Kings from 1981 to 1984 before being traded to the Chicago Bulls. After a season and a half with the Bulls, Johnson played one season with the San Antonio Spurs. While with the Spurs, Johnson led the league in field goal percentage at .632 one of the highest in NBA history.\nDuring the 1986 off-season, Johnson was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for longtime Portland's fixture Mychal Thompson; the team intended to start Johnson at power forward alongside defensive-minded center Sam Bowie. Five games into the season, however, Bowie suffered a broken leg (one of many such injuries he would endure in his ill-fated career), and Johnson was moved to the starting center role, with aging veteran Caldwell Jones replacing him at power forward. Only a couple games later, on November 26, 1986, Johnson scored a career-best 40 points, while also grabbing 10 rebounds, during a 118–114 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. That year, Johnson enjoyed his best season, averaging nearly 17 points per game, while averaging a .555 field goal percentage.\nThe next season, Bowie again broke his leg, and Johnson assumed the starting center position. Unfortunately for him, he would himself be injured, and was replaced in the lineup by Kevin Duckworth, whose stellar play earned him the job permanently. Nevertheless, Johnson earned a selection on the West All-Star team, but was unable to play due to injury. An attempt to start both players in a dual-post configuration, and the Johnson/Duckworth controversy was one of several which distracted the team in the 1988–89 season (which led to a losing record and a first-round playoff sweep). After that season, the rather unhappy Johnson was left unprotected in the 1989 NBA expansion draft, and was selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Johnson, unhappy with being drafted by an expansion team, played only four games for the Timberwolves before being traded to the Seattle SuperSonics; he played only 21 games for Seattle that season. He played 24 games for the Golden State Warriors the following year; and retired at the conclusion of the 1990–91 season.\nJohnson holds the NCAA single season and career records for field goal percentage. He led the NBA in personal fouls during the 1981–82 and 1986–87 seasons, and led the NBA in disqualifications during the 1981–82, 1985–86, and 1986–87 seasons.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson, who retired from playing and permanently settled in Portland, now works with an organization called The Best of Yachting and is an investor in business in the area."

        "title": "Major League Baseball on NBC",
        "text": "Major League Baseball on NBC is the de facto branding for weekly broadcasts of Major League Baseball (MLB) games that are produced by NBC Sports, and televised on the NBC television network; and, as of 2022, as well as on its co-owned streaming service, Peacock. Major League Baseball games first aired on the network from to , including \"The NBC Game of the Week\", when CBS acquired the broadcast television rights.\nGames returned to the network in as part of The Baseball Network, a time-brokered package of broadcasts produced by Major League Baseball and split with ABC. After The Baseball Network folded after the 1995 season, NBC retained a smaller package through 2000, alternating rights to a package of postseason games with Fox (with NBC carrying the National League Championship Series and World Series in odd-numbered years, and the American League Championship Series and All-Star Game in even-numbered years).\nThe Comcast SportsNet regional sports networks became part of NBC Sports after Comcast acquired NBCUniversal in 2011; they currently hold rights to the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, Philadelphia Phillies, and San Francisco Giants. In 2022, NBC returned to national MLB coverage by acquiring a package of games for its streaming service Peacock.\nHistory.\nFrom 1947 to 1956 and again in 1965, NBC only aired the All-Star Game (beginning in 1950) and World Series. From 1957 to 1989, the network aired the Saturday afternoon \"Game of the Week\" (or a variation of it prior to 1966, when NBC did not hold the exclusive over-the-air television rights). From 1994 to 1995, NBC aired games under a joint broadcasting venture with Major League Baseball and ABC called The Baseball Network. From 1996 to 2000, the network's league coverage was reduced to postseason games (three Division Series games in prime time, the American League Championship Series in even-numbered years, and the National League Championship Series and World Series in odd-numbered years), as well as the All-Star Game in even-numbered years (during years when NBC did not hold the rights to the World Series).\nAttempted bid for 2007–13.\nA June 4, 2006 \"Broadcasting &amp; Cable\" article stated that Fox may have considered a partnership with another network (which ultimately, turned out to be TBS) for the next contract. NBC was the only network named in connection to a possible partnership in the article. The setup being suggested was similar to the last time NBC had the rights to baseball, that being the network would get the rights to some League Championship Series games and alternate rights to the World Series and All-Star Game with Fox, which may or may not have kept the \"Game of the Week\". After weeks of speculation and rumors, on July 11, 2006, at the All-Star Game, Major League Baseball announced a renewal of its existing current with Fox Sports through 2013, allowing the Fox network to retain exclusivity of the television rights to the World Series and the All-Star Game (the World Series would begin the Wednesday after the League Championship Series are completed). The deal also allowed Fox to retain the Saturday \"Game of the Week\" and gave it broadcast rights to one League Championship Series annually. This ruled out baseball returning to NBC, as the two annual showpiece events were not available in any contract the network might obtain before then.\nOLN (later NBCSN) briefly considered acquiring the rights to the Sunday and Wednesday games, which expired after the 2005 season. However, on September 14, 2005, existing rightsholder ESPN signed an eight-year contract with the league, highlighted by the continuation of ESPN's \"Sunday Night Baseball\" with additional, exclusive team appearances. Currently, NBCUniversal parent Comcast owns 5.44% of the MLB Network and featured a New York Mets–San Francisco Giants game with Bob Costas and Al Michaels (who while working for the Cincinnati Reds had previously helped call the 1972 World Series for NBC and from 2006-2021, served as the play-by-play voice for NBC's \"Sunday Night Football\" telecasts) in July 2011.\n\"The New York Times\", however, reported that it was unlikely that NBC would get baseball, as the network would have to preempt up to three weeks of NFL coverage on Sunday nights. However, the NFL used to not schedule a Sunday night game on the second night of the World Series, which meant that NBC gaining the rights was not completely out of the question (however, the following Sunday, in which a possible World Series Game 7 is scheduled, a Sunday night NFL game is also scheduled). In addition to this, other Sunday playoff games, such as the ALCS and NLCS could be pushed to the afternoon. This might not be appetizing to league officials, as major playoff games would go up head-to-head against highly rated afternoon NFL games (as opposed to today's system, in which only one game out of two for the day would go up against network NFL broadcasts).\nAttempted bid for 2014–21.\nDuring the summer of 2012, NBC Sports was reportedly involved in negotiations for a television contract with Major League Baseball. NBCSN was expected to play a large part in NBC's bid. However, it was likely that NBC would want either marquee event (All-Star Game and World Series) to air on the broadcast network rather than cable. This could have potentially conflicted with the network's broadcasts of \"Sunday Night Football\", which has generally had a game or two scheduled on nights when a World Series game is held since 2010; however, prior to this, no game was scheduled on these nights so it would not have been unprecedented. Besides the potential conflicts with \"Sunday Night Football\", another disadvantage for NBCSN is that it was available in fewer than 80 million homes, trailing the national reach of both Fox Sports 1 and TBS.\nOn August 28, 2012, Major League Baseball and ESPN agreed to an eight-year, $5.6 billion contract extension, the largest broadcasting deal in Major League Baseball history. It gave ESPN the rights to up to 90 regular-season games, alternating rights to one of the two Wild Card games (between American League and National League teams) each year, and the rights to all regular-season tiebreaker games. On September 19, 2012, \"Sports Business Daily\" reported that the league would agree to separate eight-year television deals with Fox Sports and Turner Sports through the 2021 season. On October 2, 2012, the new deal between Major League Baseball and TBS was officially confirmed; NBC looked to be left without a package, because though it made an offer, Major League Baseball did not consider NBC a serious bidder after the ESPN deal was made public. Sources said that NBC did not make a strong offer, and that it was most interested in ESPN's package, which included exclusivity on Sunday night and rights to the two mid-week games. When ESPN took that package, NBC's interest waned.\n\"MLB Sunday Leadoff\" on Peacock.\nOn June 14, 2021, NBC Sports announced that it would stream the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants' June 18–20 series exclusively for free on NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock. The local rights to both teams are owned by the NBC Sports Regional Networks, and the games featured a mixture of personnel from the teams' broadcasts on NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports Philadelphia: the commentary team featured the Giants' Jon Miller on play-by-play, with his partner Mike Krukow, and the Phillies' John Kruk and Jimmy Rollins, serving as analysts.\nPeacock would ultimately acquire a new package of 18 Sunday afternoon games from each participating team, beginning in the 2022 Major League Baseball season, branded as \"MLB Sunday Leadoff\". Peacock's first game aired on May 8 between the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox, and was also simulcast on the NBC broadcast network (marking its first MLB broadcast since 2000). It also had officially been 7,873 days since the network last televised a Major League Baseball game.\nThe agreement also includes rights to the All-Star Futures Game, and an MLB content hub on Peacock with classic games and other content.\nRelated coverage.\n\"Major League Baseball on NBC Radio\".\nFor many years, the NBC Radio Network also had a role in Major League Baseball coverage. The network shared World Series broadcast rights with CBS beginning in 1927, with All-Star Game broadcasts added in 1933. The Mutual Broadcasting System joined NBC and CBS in 1935; the three networks continued to share coverage of baseball's \"jewels\" in this manner through 1938, with Mutual gaining exclusive rights to the World Series in 1939 and the All-Star Game in 1942.\nIn 1957, NBC replaced Mutual as the exclusive radio broadcaster for the World Series and All-Star Game. The network would continue in this role through 1975, with CBS taking over the rights the following year. NBC Radio did not air regular season games during this period (save for the three-game National League tie-breaker playoff in 1962); nor did the network cover the League Championship Series from 1969 to 1975, those series instead having local team radio broadcasts syndicated nationally over ad hoc networks.\nNBC ended its radio association with baseball after the 1975 season in order to clear space for the network's 24-hour \"News and Information\" service programming.\nMajor League Baseball coverage on NBC's owned-and-operated television stations.\nEven as WNBC became the first to broadcast Major League Baseball games in 1939 with the pioneer broadcast being that of an August 26 doubleheader at Ebbets Field between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds, it does not have any local broadcasts today, with the over-the-air packages of both the New York Mets and Yankees airing on WPIX, and produced by their cable rightsholders SportsNet New York (which is partially owned by NBCUniversal) and YES Network respectively. The station has aired numerous Met (since 1962) and Yankee games (and before 1957, games of the Dodgers and Giants) as part of NBC's network coverage, including 18 of the Yankees' World Series appearances (12 of which the team won), and three Mets World Series appearances (two of which the Mets won).\nKCST was home to San Diego Padres games during two different periods, first in the 1971 and 1972 seasons, and again from 1984 to 1986. The station also carried any games that were part of ABC's MLB coverage in 1976, then over to NBC's MLB broadcasts from 1977 to 1989; this included the Padres' first World Series appearance in 1984; limited postseason games involving the Padres were aired from 1995 to 2000.\nKXAS (then WBAP-TV until 1974) aired Texas Rangers games as part of NBC's broadcast contract with Major League Baseball from their arrival in 1972 until 1989, and again for the postseason only from 1994 to 2000.\nOn November 1, 2007, KNTV entered into a three-year broadcast contract with the San Francisco Giants through 2010, replacing the team's longtime broadcaster KTVU, which had carried Giants games since 1961, three years after the team moved to the Bay Area and KTVU first began broadcasting. The team's first game broadcast on KNTV aired on April 1, 2008. KNTV broadcasts 20 to 40 Giants baseball games a year, which are produced by sister network NBC Sports Bay Area. In addition, KNTV airs \"Giants Clubhouse\" each weekend during the MLB season. All of the Giants broadcasts are carried in high definition. The station has preempted Giants telecasts during the Summer Olympics due to NBC currently holding the television rights to the Olympics. The Giants' contract with KNTV concluded at the end of the 2010 season, however, the broadcast rights were renewed prior to the 2011 season. Thus, it is one of the few major network affiliates that carry live local MLB games to viewers in their broadcast area. Despite this, it does not offer any live over-the-air broadcasts of the American League's Oakland Athletics, which are broadcast exclusively by NBC Sports California on cable.\nSince Comcast acquired the WCAU's parent NBCUniversal in 2011, WCAU has aired Philadelphia's major sports teams in many years. Because of those commitments to air these major sports teams, they reschedule NBC network programs preempted on the station. WCAU, as both a CBS and NBC station, has also aired Philadelphia's pro sports teams through their network coverage as well. On January 2, 2014, Comcast and the Philadelphia Phillies announced a 25-year, $2.5 billion TV contract, including WCAU and Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia (now NBC Sports Philadelphia); although it averaged $100 million a year, it was structured to begin below the average and end above it. As part of its 25-year TV contract, WCAU took over free-to-air broadcast rights for Phillies baseball games from MyNetworkTV affiliate WPHL-TV beginning in the 2014 season, including its Opening Day game and selected games aired on the station.\nSurviving telecasts.\nFor all of the League Championship Series telecasts spanning from 1969 to 1975, only Game 2 of the 1972 American League Championship Series (Oakland vs. Detroit) is known to exist. However, the copy on the trade circuit of Game 2 of the 1972 ALCS is missing the Bert Campaneris–Lerrin LaGrow brawl. There are some instances where the only brief glimpse of telecast footage of an early LCS game can be seen in a surviving newscast from that night. For instance, the last out of the 1973 National League Championship Series as described by Jim Simpson was played on that night's \"NBC Nightly News\", but other than that, the entire game is gone. On the day the New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles wrapped up their respective League Championship Series in 1969, a feature story on the \"CBS Evening News\" showed telecast clips of the ALCS game (there's no original sound, just voiceover narration). This is all that likely remains of anything from that third game of the Orioles–Twins series. Simpson's call of the injury of Reggie Jackson during Game 5 of the 1972 ALCS is heard on the 1972 World Series film, as well as Curt Gowdy's call of the home run by Johnny Bench in Game 5 of the 1972 NLCS as well as Bob Moose throwing a wild pitch to pinch-hitter Hal McRae scoring George Foster with the winning run.\nWhile all telecasts of World Series games starting with 1975 are accounted for and exist, the LCS is still a spotty situation through the late 1970s:"

        "text": "Bobby Martin (November 3, 1987 – April 28, 2020) nicknamed \"Bobby No Legs”, was born with Caudal regression syndrome. As he had no legs or hips, he used his arms to run. A graduate of Colonel White High School in Dayton, Ohio, he played defensive lineman for his high school varsity team. He later attended Central State University.\nBiography.\nMartin was tall and weighed as he was born with a significant form of Caudal regression syndrome which resulted in being born without hips or legs. During his 2005 high school senior season, he was removed from play at half-time in a game against Mount Healthy High School by officials claiming he was in breach of league rules requiring players to wear thigh pads, knee pads and shoes. Colonel White High School was later told by the Ohio High School Athletic Association that this decision was incorrect and Martin was allowed to continue to finish the season. He finished the season with 48 tackles. At halftime of one game, he was named the Homecoming King. On July 12, 2006, Martin won the ESPY award for Best Male Athlete with a Disability.\nAfter graduation, Martin studied marketing at Central State University and did not play football. In 2007, then Cleveland Browns head coach Romeo Crennel invited Martin to a practice. After seeing wide receiver Dennis Northcutt evade player after player, Martin approached Northcutt and claimed that he could tackle him. At the insistence of teammate Braylon Edwards, Northcutt allowed Martin to challenge him. During the run, Martin hung with Northcutt for 20 yards before forcing him out at the one-yard line.\nAfter Martin's playing days, he had several run ins with police for various crimes. On April 28, 2020, Martin died when he crashed an ATV he had stolen earlier that evening."

        "text": "Rugby league is a popular team sport in Papua New Guinea, and is the national sport. Papua New Guinea has a reputation for being the most passionate supporter of the game in the world.\nHistory.\nPapua New Guinea first came into contact with rugby league during the gold rush in the 1930s through Australian miners. Australian soldiers stationed in the country during and after the Second World War reintroduced the sport and in 1949 and the Papua New Guinea Rugby Football League was founded. It quickly became a popular spectator sport.\nDuring the 1960s rugby league grew to be the clear national sport of the country. Despite being the most popular spectator sport, rugby league was mainly played by Australians and New Zealanders at this time. Participation numbers did not grow to reflect spectator numbers for another decade.\nThe governing body for rugby league in Papua New Guinea became members of the Rugby League International Federation in 1974 and the national team's first ever Test match was a 40–12 home defeat by Great Britain a year later. They first competed in the Rugby League World Cup in the 1985–89 competition.\nA record attendance was established at the Papua New Guinea Grand Final held at the Morobean capital on 8 September 2010. When the Goroka Lahanis defeated the Mendi Muruks 21–10 in front of a crowd that was believed to be 20,000+\nThe PNG Hunters professional rugby league football club formed in 2013 to compete in the Queensland Rugby League's Intrust Super Cup. The Hunters won the Intrust Super Cup in 2017.\nIn October 2015, Papua New Guinea sealed a deal to co-host the 2017 Rugby League World Cup along with Australia and New Zealand. The Kumuls were given their 'own pool' hosting both their Group C fixtures against Wales and Ireland, plus an 'inter-group' match against USA of Group D, in Port Moresby.\nGoverning body.\nThe Papua New Guinea Rugby Football League are the governing body for rugby league in Papua New Guinea. They have been members of the Rugby League International Federation and Pacific Islands Rugby League Federation.\nDomestic competitions.\n1990 saw the launch of a national competition then called the SP Inter-City Cup or SP Cup (1990–2008) and later the Bemobile Cup (2009–2010) after changes in sponsorship. The current competition is sponsored by pacific telecommunications giant Digicel and is now known as the Digicel Cup. The current competition is made up of 12 teams from various cities or provinces around the country. The competition follows the conventional Australian NRL format, with 26 round robin games followed by the top 4 teams entering the finals play-offs.\nBelow the Digicel Cup exist many local and provincial competitions, the most prestigious of which is the Port Moresby League. In 2007 a new league called the Nokondi Cup was created for teams in the Eastern Highlands province.\nA Port Moresby team (the Port Moresby Vipers) competed in the Panasonic Cup in 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989; and in the Queensland Cup in 1996 and 1997. The 2014 season saw the PNG Hunters enter the Queensland Cup, based out of Kokopo.\nNRL team bid.\nAn official bid for a PNG team in the National Rugby League (Australia's primary rugby league competition) began in October 2008. The bid was launched by Sir Michael Somare. In 2021, Prime Minister James Marape supported the bid, stating his country wanted an NRL team by 2025. Many have also suggested the addition of one NRL team for both Papua New Guinea and the city of Cairns in Far North Queensland.\nNotable players.\nMany Papua New Guineans have gone on to play professional rugby league either in the National Rugby League in Australia or Super League in Europe. It is the goal of the PNGRL to have 120 players participating in the NRL and Super League by 2010.\nPopularity.\nRugby league is the most popular sport in Papua New Guinea and is commonly referred to as the national sport. In a nation where communities are far apart and many people live at a minimal subsistence level, rugby league is the lifeblood of the country and is considered a matter of life and death.\nDuring the 2000 Rugby League World Cup an estimated audience of 2 million watched the Kumuls lose to the Welsh Dragons in the quarter-finals in the early hours of the morning local time. Despite this loss over 50,000 fans welcomed the team at Port Moresby Airport later that week.\nA sold-out crowd always comes to watch the annual match between the Kumuls and the Australian Prime Minister's XIII.\nParticipation.\nRugby league has a huge participation rate in the junior level with every school in the country involved in a rugby league competition as rugby league is part of the school curriculum. There are 5,000 registered players between the ages of 12 and 18.\nThere are 10,000 registered senior players. They compete in 40 affiliated leagues around the country. Each league has a minimum of seven clubs and each club has four teams.\nNational teams.\nMen.\nThe Papua New Guinea men's national rugby league team are nicknamed \"Kumuls\" after the bird-of-paradise, a national symbol of the country. Their first ever Test match was a 40–12 home defeat by England in 1975.\nThey compete in the Rugby League World Cup and first entered a team in the 1985–89 competition, though it was not until the 1995 Rugby League World Cup that they were able to win away from home.\nThe Papua New Guinea national rugby league team usually play against an Australian national rugby league team (The Prime Minister's XIII made up of players in teams that have not qualified for the National Rugby League Final Series) each year in Port Moresby. It is such a popular fixture that thousands of people can't get into the ground once it's full, causing people to climb onto the stadium roof or up trees outside the ground in order to see the match. The limited capacity of the stadium for this fixture often sparks riots. Spectators clashed with riot police during this fixture in 2006.\nWomen.\nThe Papua New Guines women's national rugby league team are nicknamed \"Orchids\". The name was chosen as a symbol of diversity; there are over 3,000 species of Orchid in Papua New Guinea. They competed in the Women's Rugby League World Cup for the first time at the 2017 competition. At the 2021 World Cup they won their opening match against Canada."
