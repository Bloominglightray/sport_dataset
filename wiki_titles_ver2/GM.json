The Sun Devils represented Arizona State University and were coached by Greg Powers, in his 11th season.\nSeason.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the start of the Sun Devils' season was delayed. Due to scheduling problems resulting from the pandemic, Arizona State entered into a scheduling alliance with the Big Ten and would play a conference schedule. The Sun Devils would only participate in regular season games against Big Ten teams, the program would not formally join the conference nor would any of its games be counted in the Big Ten standings. Arizona State would also not be eligible for the Big Ten Tournament.\nDue to the nature of their agreement, Arizona State played all of its games on the road. That, and playing against stronger competition that previous years, led to the Sun Devils' facing an uphill battle in their pursuit of a second NCAA berth. In ASU's first series of the season they were swept by Michigan but were dealt a serious blow when senior captain and all-time leading goal scorer, Johnny Walker, suffered a knee injury that would keep him out for 6 weeks. After another offensively inept series, the Sun Devils suddenly came to life against Wisconsin, taking both games and jumping back into the USCHO rankings.\nThe team played well in Walker's absence, ending the year with a 4–6–2 record, but when their captain returned the team was in the middle of a string of ranked opponents. For the entire month of January, Arizona State played top-20 teams. When the dust settled, ASU's record had plummeted and the team had virtually no chance of making the national tournament. The team played well over the final three weeks of the season but they couldn't recover from a disastrous 1–7 run.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Daniel Bell-Drummond was named as vice-captain, replacing Joe Denly. Jack Leaning was named as captain for the One-Day Cup.\nAs a result of Brexit, the ECB confirmed that all Kolpak contracts would be terminated after the 2020 season. Counties were instead able to field two overseas players in all formats. Heino Kuhn, who had been contracted to Kent under a Kolpak deal, was, as a result, counted as an overseas player for this season.\nOn 18 September, during the T20 Blast Finals day at Edgbaston, Kent defeated Sussex in the semi-final. In the final, Kent defeated Somerset by 25 runs to win the tournament for a second time. This was the first trophy for the county since winning the 2007 Twenty20 Cup.\nSquad.\nDepartures.\nAll-rounder Calum Haggett and bowler Ivan Thomas were both released by the club after their contracts expired at the end of the 2020 season.\nOn 20 May, 27-year-old left-arm spin bowler Imran Qayyum announced his retirement from all cricket due to a shoulder injury. On 20 July, bowler Tim Groenewald retired from professional cricket following ankle surgery in April.\nArrivals.\nIn March 2021, Kent announced the signing of West Indian international fast bowler Miguel Cummins for the first eight matches of the County Championship. Zimbabwean born batsman Tawanda Muyeye, who qualifies as a domestic player having been educated at Eastbourne College, signed his first professional contract with the club on 31 March 2021. Muyeye was voted the Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year in the 2020 edition of the almanack.\nOn 20 April, Kent announced the signing of former Pakistan international fast bowler Mohammad Amir for the second half of the T20 Blast. On 8 June, however, it was confirmed that Amir would be unable to join up with the squad due to rescheduling of the Pakistan Super League and COVID-19-related travel restrictions. New Zealand bowler Adam Milne was announced as a replacement for Amir, with Milne returning for a fourth spell with the county.\nOn 5 May, following a number of injuries to bowlers, Kent announced the loan signing of New Zealand-born Matt Quinn from Essex for their next four Championship matches. On 16 June, Quinn signed a three-year contract to join the county from 2022 and also rejoined on loan for the remainder of the 2021 season.\nOn 12 May, Kent announced the signing of Afghanistan leg spin bowler Qais Ahmad for the T20 Blast. On 9 June, Kent signed left-arm spin bowler James Logan on a short-term contract. Logan signed a two-year contract extension on 27 June.\nAfter an unnamed played tested positive for COVID-19, all players who were in the squad for the T20 Blast match against Surrey on 9 July were forced to self-isolate. Kent called up a number of second team players and signed other homegrown players to join the remainder of the senior squad for a Championship game against Sussex; Joe Gordon, Harry Houillon, Dan Lincoln, Jas Singh and Bailey Wightman all made their first-class debuts, and Harry Finch played his first game for Kent against his former team. Kent signed three Scotland international players – Calum MacLeod, George Munsey and Safyaan Sharif – to strengthen the squad for the last two matches of the T20 Blast group stage. Elliot Hooper also made his Kent debut in the T20 Blast fixture against Middlesex, having previously played a single first-class game for Sussex. Munsey was also named in the squad for the One-Day Cup.\nSquad list.\nThe following second team players and short-term signings also featured in matches, but were not members of the long-term squad during the season: Harry Houillon, Calum MacLeod, Safyaan Sharif, Jas Singh, Elliot Hooper and Bailey Wightman.\nCounty Championship.\nThe County Championship returned in 2021 after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had forced its cancellation in 2020. The tournament was contested in a new format, replacing the two division structure. For the first phase of the tournament, teams were split into three groups of six. Kent were placed in Group 3 where they played ten matches against their opponents on a home and away basis. The top two teams from each group advanced to Division One for the second phase of the competition (where a further four matches will be played), with the other teams progressing to Divisions Two and Three. The team that finished top of Division One would be the county champions; the top two teams from Division One would then contest a five-day match at Lord's for the Bob Willis Trophy.\nDivision 3.\n&lt;section begin=Division 3Table /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Division 3Table /&gt;\nOne-Day Cup.\nDue to the inaugural season of The Hundred being played at the same time, many of the top county cricketers were unavailable to play in the One-Day Cup. As well as several first-team players, Kent Head Coach Matt Walker was involved in The Hundred as Assistant Coach for the Oval Invincibles. Simon Cook took over as Interim Head Coach, Jack Leaning was named captain, and Ollie Robinson was named vice-captain for the tournament. Leaning was selected by the Trent Rockets as short-term cover for Steven Mullaney, meaning that he would miss games against Sussex and Essex, with Robinson taking over as captain."

        "text": "The Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium, also known as the Mirpur Stadium, is a sports ground in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. The ground has hosted 177 international cricket matches since 2006. On 17 January 2018 during the 2017–18 Bangladesh Tri-Nation Series, it became the sixth and the fastest to host 100 ODIs. It is named after A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime Minister of Bengal, who was accorded the title \"Sher-e-Bangla\" (\"The Tiger of Bengal\"). The venue was taken over by the Bangladesh Cricket Board in 2004, replacing the Bangabandhu National Stadium as the home of both the men's and women's national teams. The first international match on the ground, a One Day International (ODI), was played between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in 2006, with the first Test match played the following year between Bangladesh and India in 2000. The first Twenty20 International (T20I) match on the ground was played between Bangladesh and West Indies in 2011. Women's One Day International and Twenty20 International cricket have also been played on the ground.\nIn cricket, a century is a score of 100 or more runs in a single innings by a batter. A century is regarded as a landmark score for batters and a player's number of centuries is generally recorded in their career statistics. \nThe first batsman to score a century in Test cricket at Mirpur was Dinesh Karthik of India against Bangladesh during the ground's debut Test match on 25 May 2007. Gautam Gambhir was the first batsman to score a century in ODI cricket on this ground, scoring 101 runs off 113 balls. Mohammad Ashraful was the first Bangladeshi batsman to score a century at the ground, scoring 101 off 193 balls against Sri Lanka in December 2008.

The site is an area of considerable biodiversity supporting a number of rare species and has been designated as an Important Bird Area as well as a Special Protection Area.\nHistory.\nThe course was conceived and constructed in the middle of World War II by an enthusiastic group of Swedish industrialists, on a site overlooking Occupied Denmark. The club was admitted to the Swedish Golf Federation in 1943 and the opening shot was made by Gustaf Adolf, Crown Prince of Sweden on July 6, 1945. The full 18 hole course was completed in 1959 under the supervision of Thure Bruce.\nAmongst the successful players that have represented the club are Johny Andersson, winner of the 1961 European Amateur Team Championship, and Jan Rube, 1974 Swedish Golfer of the Year.\nThe club has hosted the Höganäs Ladies Open on the Ladies European Tour twice. In 1984 when Kitrina Douglas won ahead of Liselotte Neumann, and in 1985 when Liselotte Neumann won by one stroke over Laura Davies to secure the first Swedish European tour victory on home soil.

The club's ground is currently south of the village, at the end of a track to a field behind the Treetops Hospice. Before this, the club led a peripatetic existence. The earliest known location for the club was a field next to All Saints' church, in the 1920s. By the 1930s, games took place behind the Blue Ball pub (now The Risley Park). After the Second World War, a Rev Hughes arranged for matches to be played on the Risley Hall Approved School ground, until the mid-1970s when they then moved onto a pitch on the Friesland School grounds. Between 1984 and 1988, home games were played at the former Draycott CC Hopwell Road ground, in Draycott, before returning to the Risley Hall School in the late-1980s. In the early 1990s the 1st XI team finished top of the LECA Evening League's Division 3, 2 and 1 in successive years (1991–93) shortly before moving onto the Treetops Hospice ground in 1994.\nThe club currently has two senior teams competing in the Derbyshire County Cricket League and a long-established junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Erewash Young Cricketers League.\nClub performance.\nThe Derbyshire County Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by division) since 2014.\n \nThe South Nottinghamshire Cricket League competition results showing the club's position (by Division) between 2005 and 2013.\nThe Newark Club Cricket Alliance Sunday League competition results showing the club's position (by Division) between 2010 and 2013.\n "

        "text": "The 2020–21 Niagara Purple Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 25th season of play for the program, the 23rd at the Division I level, and the 11th season in the Atlantic Hockey conference. The Purple Eagles represented Niagara University and were coached by Jason Lammers, in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Niagara's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nNiagara had a difficult start to their season, with the team's defense unable to withstand sustained pressure for most of their games. By mid-January the team was near the bottom of the conference with just 2 wins in 13 games. To make matters worse, the Purple Eagles weren't able to play any games for 6 weeks due to COVID cancellations. When they finally managed to play again they decided to use Chad Veltri as their starting goaltender. In the final two weekends of the regular season the choice appeared to work out as Niagara split both weekends while Veltri recorded the only shutout for the Purple Eagles on the campaign.\nNiagara entered the postseason as the 9th seed and needed to beat Mercyhurst to keep their season alive. After the Lakers scored the first two goals of the game it looked like NU would have an early summer but Veltri withstood a barrage of shots from Mercyhurst over the final 38 minutes and allowed Niagara to crawl its way back and win on a late marker from junior transfer Walker Sommer. In the quarterfinals, the Purple Eagles had to face Robert Morris, a team that had won all four meetings to that point. The Colonials won the first game but they needed overtime to do so. In keeping the game close, Veltri game his team an opportunity to win and the sophomore netminder remained hot in game 2 as well; Veltri faced 51 shots over an 80-minute span and the frantic pace appeared to wear on Robert Morris who weren't able to get a single shot on goal in over 7 minutes of play in the second overtime. Instead, it was Niagara who fired 5 shots on goal with the last tying the series at 1-all. Veltri was again front and center for the team in the deciding game, facing 45 shots in regulation. Niagara built a 2-goal lead and held it until just 12 seconds remained in the game, when RMU scored their only goal on the night, allowing Niagara to pull off a huge upset in the conference tournament.\nIn the semifinals, Niagara had to get past league-leading American International, who had not played a game since the end of January due to their own series of cancellations. Veltri continued to keep the Purple Eagles in contention, stopping everything in the first two periods and giving the team a lead entering the third, but AIC's slumbering offense awoke in the final frame, scored two goals, and ended Niagara's improbable run.\nTrevor Poeze and Patrick Pugliese sat out the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

When they did play good teams, the Huskies were able to compete on defense but the scoring was reduced to a paltry amount. In their final 8 games against teams that were in the top-20 at some point, MTU scored more than 1 goal twice and lost all but one contest.

        "text": "Jack Allan Hayes Blatherwick is an American hockey training physiologist. Blatherwick helped Herb Brooks train the 1980 U.S. Olympic Team and then joined Brooks' staff on the New York Rangers. In 2019, Blatherwick was the recipient of the Lester Patrick Trophy \"for outstanding service to hockey in the United States.\"\nEarly life and education.\nBlatherwick earned his PhD in psychology from the University of Minnesota in 1975, writing his dissertation on teaching speed through off-ice training. He tested 3,000 players from pee-wee to National Hockey League (NHL) level and verified the off-ice attributes could increase skating speed and acceleration. While earning his doctoral degree, Blatherwick coached the ice hockey team at Breck School. However, he was fired in 1974 due to a \"philosophical dispute.\"\nCareer.\nUpon completing his PhD, Blatherwick worked with the Auggies hockey team at Augsburg University, testing them on strength, speed and endurance using methods that he had personally developed. After the Auggies won the NAIA Ice Hockey Championship, Herb Brooks asked Blatherwick to test the members of the 1978–79 Minnesota Golden Gophers on the ice and in a laboratory setting. His methods for endurance included short under-five second bursts of flat-out speed, followed by a slowdown period to resemble periods during games. Blatherwick suggested to Brooks that he runs practise at faster speeds to better prepare players for game settings. His methods gained recognition from the National Hockey League (NHL) and he worked part-time as a conditioning coach for the Minnesota North Stars, earning the nickname Cardiac Jack because of his workouts and continuous use of the words 'cardiovascular fitness.' A year later, Brooks and Blatherwick repeated the tests during the tryouts for the United States 1980 Olympic Team. Following that experience, Blatherwick said, \"that was the first time I saw one physiological measure that separates elite players from those who are very good.”\nBlatherwick worked closely with Brooks to train and develop players during the 1980 Olympics; studying films to develop drills and create practice plans. He later said Brooks would call him early in the morning to discuss on- and off-ice practice routines. As the United States beat the Soviet Union in what was later called the Miracle on Ice, team captain Mike Eruzione praised Blatherwick's training as a key feature in their gold medal win. Brooks' son Daniel later said: \"I don't think the Miracle on Ice could have happened without Jack.\" Their relationship continued after the Olympics and he followed Brooks to the New York Rangers as a conditioning coach and returned to coach the United States Olympic team before the 1984 Winter Olympics. While working with the Rangers, Blatherwick conditioned players \"through such off-ice flexibility exercises as a series of two-legged and one-legged jumps wearing weighted vests and running in place on a portable jumping pit with quick high-knee lifts.\" From 1986 until 1991, Blatherwick worked a conditioning coach for the Gophers. He then spent one season as the head coach of Hopkins ice hockey team before joining Brooks as an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils in 1992.\nIn 2005, Blatherwick established the Hockey Development Committee to \"set the development structure for MYHA girls and boys teams from Termites through Jr. Gold within the guidelines and rules of District 6, MN Hockey and USA Hockey.\" In 2009, he was inducted into the Minnesota Hockey Coaches Association Hall of Fame. Blatherwick later joined the Washington Capitals organization as their exercise physiologist, earning praise from strength and conditioning coach John Wawrzyniak. In 2019, Blatherwick was the recipient of the Lester Patrick Trophy \"for outstanding service to hockey in the United States.\""

The Wildcats represented the University of New Hampshire and were coached by Mike Souza, in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of New Hampshire's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nAfter a good start to the season, UNH was bit by the injury bug. The team lost several key upperclassmen for extended periods, including team captain Charlie Kelleher. The Wildcats were able to play well in some of their games but the team went through an 8-game stretch where they couldn't win a single match. By the end of the season the team had gotten healthy again, but they sat 10th in the conference. UNH came alive in the Hockey East Tournament, knocking off long-time rival Maine 7–2 in the opening round.

        "text": "The Villanova Wildcats men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Villanova Wildcats men's basketball program in various categories, including points, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Wildcats represent Villanova University in the NCAA's Big East Conference.\nVillanova began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1920. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Villanova's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The Bulldogs represented Ferris State University and were coached by Bob Daniels, in his 29th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Ferris State's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nFrom the very beginning Ferris State had a bad season. Losses piled up week after week and, as the year progressed, the team produced a record that was so dreadful it needs historical context to properly appreciate. The 2019–20 Ferris State team was the first season in the 45-year history of the program to finish with less than 10 wins. This season had seven times fewer wins (1 vs. 7). The team's only win on the year came against a Division III team, but not just any D-III program, Trine's program was just four years old and had yet to accomplish anything significant. Ferris State allowed over 4 goals per game on the year and scored nearly half as many themselves (if the Trine game is excluded they scored exactly 2 goals per game). The only saving grace for the Bulldogs is a tie they earned against Bemidji State, a ranked team no less. In the end, however, Ferris State went winless against their peers, an ignominious achievement accomplished by just two other teams in history: 1961 Brown and 1962 Colorado College.\nRoster.\nAs of September 11, 2020.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Seawolves represent the University of Alaska Anchorage.\nSeason.\nIn the summer of 2020, the university announced that the men's ice hockey program would be terminated following the 2020–21 season. The move came as a result from many years of poor attendance and the announcement by 7 members of the 10-team WCHA to leave the conference. A year earlier, due to the decline in revenue for the state, there were rumors that the Seawolves would merge their program with the one in Fairbanks, but nothing came to fruition. The end result was that Alaska Anchorage could no longer support several of its programs and, despite once being the cornerstone of the athletic department, the expensive ice hockey team was scheduled for a swan song in 2021.\nBefore a single game could be played, however, the COVID-19 pandemic made playing the season untenable. In November, Alaska Anchorage suspended all of its indoor sports due to the increased likelihood of spreading the virus. The cancellation effectively ended the program, although a group of alumni, boosters and residents had been attempting to put together a large donation to keep the team running for at least two years. By mid-December, more than $1 million had been raised with a goal of securing $1.5 million and an additional $1.5 million in pledges by February 21, however, the team's future was undetermined.\nSchedule and Results.\nSeason Cancelled"

The Catamounts represented the University of Vermont and were coached by Todd Woodcroft, in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Vermont's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nVermont's first season under Todd Woodcroft could hardly have gone worse. Aside from the problems caused by the pandemic, the team's offense was nearly invisible for most of the year. The Catamounts only once scored more than 3 goals (their only win on the season), and were shut out on three separate occasions, a little less than a quarter of their games. One silver lining was that most of the teams they faces were ranked and Vermont is in the process of rebuilding after an abysmal season the year before.\nAzzaro Tinling and Whim Stålberg sat out the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The club has a history dating back to the late 19th century.\nGround.\nThe home ground is located on Locko Road in Spondon, Derbyshire and has two pitches, an all-weather pitch and a two lane, all-weather net facility. The 1st and 2nd XI teams use the pitch directly in front of the pavilion, rated by the DCCL as a Grade A+ ground, and the 3rd and 4th XI use the pitch in the field beyond the 1st pitch, rated a Grade B ground.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known record of Spondon Cricket Club dates back to 1883 when the local village boys were invited to join with the pupils of \"Spondon House School for Sons of Gentlemen\". The school was housed in a Georgian mansion that was a secondary seat of the Drury Lowes, on the Locko estate. A pre match photograph survives from the period, showing the boys team on the school grounds. Both the school and the village team officially amalgamated in 1903 and set up a ground on Royal Hill Road. The club purchased the ground in 1924, and managed to pay the debt in full by 1945. The club had a 'golden age' in the 1960s with 16 trophies returning to Royal Hill Road between 1962 and 1972. The ground was further improved as a new pavilion was opened in 1970 by Brian Clough and a match between Derby County football team and Spondon CC. The club continued to thrive but eventually outgrew Royal Hill Road which was not big enough to play premier league cricket, or house the growing junior section and 3rd and 4th teams. In 2006 the Club sold the Royal Hill Road ground and moved to a ground on Locko Road. Their new Pavilion was officially opened by Councillor Roy Webb, Mayor of Derby 8 March 2006. The following year, the 1st XI won their first Premier League Championship.\nThe club currently has 4 senior teams competing in the Derbyshire County Cricket League, a Sunday 1st XI in the Mansfield and District Cricket League, an expanding girls' section which has developed into a Senior Women's League team, and a very successful junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Erewash Young Cricketers League.\nClub Performance.\nThe Derbyshire County Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 1999.\nThe Mansfield and District Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league by Section (Division) since 2019.\nThe Derbyshire Cricket Board Indoor Competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 2014.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2021–22 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team represented Indiana University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. They were led by first-year head coach, and former Indiana standout, Mike Woodson. The team played its home games at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, as a member of the Big Ten Conference. The season officially kicked off with the annual event, Hoosier Hysteria, on October 2, 2021.\nThis season saw a list of streaks come to an end for the Hoosiers. They finished the season 21–14 overall, and 9–11 in conference play. Along the way, IU ended losing streaks to Purdue, Michigan, and Illinois. As the #9 seed, they also advanced to the semifinals of the Big Ten Conference tournament, something they hadn't done since 2013. They lost to Iowa, 77–80, the eventual tournament champions. The Hoosiers also heard their name called on Selection Sunday for the first time since 2016. After a six year absence from the NCAA tournament, IU was selected as a #12 seed to play in the NCAA tournament First Four round in Dayton, Ohio. They knocked off Wyoming to make it to the First round (round of 64) where they lost to #5 seed St. Mary's.\nPrevious season.\nThe Hoosiers finished the 2020–21 season 12–15, 7–12 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for the 10th place. As the No. 10 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they lost in the first round to Rutgers.\nOn March 15, 2021, the school fired head coach Archie Miller after four years and began its search for the next men's head basketball coach. Just shy of two weeks of Miller being fired, on March 28, 2021, Indiana University announced that former Indiana standout, Mike Woodson, would become the 30th head coach of the IU basketball program. In addition, former Ohio State head coach, Thad Matta, was hired on to be an associate athletic director in men's basketball administration.\nOffseason.\nCoaching changes.\nOn March 31, it was announced that Woodson would retain assistant coach Kenya Hunter. On April 5, it was announced that Dane Fife, former Hoosiers guard who had spent the past ten seasons as an assistant coach at Michigan State, had accepted an assistant coach position under Woodson at Indiana. Finalizing the new staff, Yasir Rosemond was announced, on April 14, as the third assistant coach. With over 15 years of college basketball experience, he has helped lead multiple players to the NBA including a few first round draft picks. In addition to this news, it was also revealed that Benny Sander was promoted to Director of Basketball Operations, and Brian Walsh assumed the role of Team and Recruitment Coordinator. Also, Director of Athletic Performance, Clif Marshall, would be retained for his fifth year.\nDepartures.\nFollowing Miller's firing, six Indiana players from the 2020–21 season entered the transfer portal. Parker Stewart, Khristian Lander, Jordan Geronimo, and Race Thompson all withdrew from the portal following talks with Woodson and chose to remain at Indiana. On April 8, Armaan Franklin announced he would leave IU and transfer to Virginia. On April 2, Trayce Jackson-Davis also chose to return to Indiana for his junior season as opposed to entering the 2021 NBA draft, stating \"I believe in Coach Woodson and I believe in the tradition of Indiana basketball\" and \"I don't want to be someone who ran away when it was tough.\"\nIncoming transfers.\nOn April 7, 2021, Indiana landed its first transfer from the transfer portal when former Pittsburgh point guard, Xavier Johnson committed to the Hoosiers. He arrives at IU with two years of eligibility remaining, should he choose to use his extra year granted by the NCAA due to COVID-19. Johnson made 81 career starts for the Panthers and averaged 13.7 points on 40.2 percent shooting. He's a career 33.6 percent 3-point shooter. In his last year at Pitt, he had the highest assist rate in the ACC 41.5 percent.\nIU landed its second transfer on April 20 when Northwestern Junior, Miller Kopp, announced his commitment. Kopp is a career 35.7% 3-point shooter, averaging 9.6 points per game over his first three seasons with the Wildcats. With this transfer, he is the first player to transfer to IU from within the Big Ten since Max Bielfeldt in 2016.\nA third transfer was announced on May 17, 2021, when Michael Durr of South Florida committed to play for IU. Durr averaged 6.7 points and 6.5 rebounds per game at USF. He's a career 47.2 percent shooter from the field and 62.9 percent from the free throw line.\nRoster.\nNote: Players' year is based on remaining eligibility. Because the NCAA did not count the 2020–21 season towards eligibility, last year's Freshmen are still considered Freshmen this season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| International Tour Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=| Big Ten Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA Tournament\nPlayer statistics.\nSource"

The original schedule had contained nine downhills, but a rescheduled one on 5 March in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria, was canceled due to fog and continual snowfall after just nine skiers had finished (with 30 needed to make the race official), and (as discussed below) the downhill during World Cup finals week was also canceled.\nThe first downhill of the season, conducted in good conditions in Val d'Isère, France, took an unusual turn when Martin Čater of Slovenia, starting 41st, unexpectedly recorded the winning time . . . eleven racers after the organizers had already held the unofficial podium ceremony and the television broadcasters had ended coverage. After that, the season returned to normal, and three=time defending champion Beat Feuz opened up a 48-point lead over his nearest rival, Matthias Mayer of Austria, with only three events to go. But then the first downhill at Saalbach-Hinterglemm was cancelled, Feuz gained 20 more points on Meyer at the second downhill there, and, at the World Cup final (scheduled for Wednesday, 17 March in Lenzerheide, Switzerland), three straight days of heavy snowfall caused the downhill finals to be cancelled. Thus Feuz, who had previously won two downhills on the Hahnenkamm in Kitzbühel during the season, won the discipline's crystal globe without a final showdown.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2021 World Ski Championships, which were held from 8–21 February in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. The men's downhill took place on 14 February 2021."

The Dolphins compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the Northeast Conference and are currently coached by Mary Grimes. The Dolphins have played their home games on Ted Grant Court at the Le Moyne Events Center in DeWitt, New York. After years of playing in the Northeast-10 Conference in NCAA Division II, the Dolphins are currently transitioning to Division I and are ineligible to participate in the NCAA tournament until the 2027–28 season.\nHistory.\nLe Moyne's first women's varsity basketball team was formed in December 1962. The initial team members were Pat Resch, Carol Collins, Claire Cunnion, Rita Ruane, Dale Amend, Barbara Schlaerth, Nancy Dillon and Bernadette Baecher. Elizabeth Schuchman joined the team before its first game, which was at the Le Moyne Athletic Center against Auburn Community College on February 9, 1963. Led by head coach Sue Gibbons, the Dolphinettes, as they were called, won that opening game, 33–26. Nancy Dillon and Dale Amend led the way with 12 points each. The Dolphinettes also earned a road win against Auburn Community, 48–46, in overtime. Bernie Baecher had 18 points in that game, and Amend added 17. The Dolphinettes dominated Nazareth, 48–6. Le Moyne did not allow a field goal in the game. Freshman Donna Argenbright led the way with 13 points, and Baecher added 11. The Dolphinettes outscored the Syracuse Orangewomen in a mid-season scrimmage. Le Moyne completed their perfect season with a 4–0 record, when they beat Cazenovia, 36–14, on March 16. Amend led the way with 17 points, and Baecher added 11 in the season finale. Statistics for Le Moyne only go back to the 1976-77 season.\nPostseason appearances.\nNCAA Division II.\nDuring their time in NCAA Division II, the Dolphins were selected to play in the NCAA Division II women's basketball tournament five times. They were selected for the 2020 tournament, but it was not held due to the cancellation of the tournament with the COVID-19 pandemic. They had a combined record of 2–4."

The Tigers represented the Rochester Institute of Technology and were coached by Wayne Wilson, in his 22nd season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of RIT's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nThroughout the entire season, RIT was a Jekyll and Hyde team, playing far better at home than they did on the road. Despite having no home fans for the entire season, as a result of COVID protocols, RIT won 7 of their 9 home games, including a sweep of then-ranked Robert Morris. Once the team hit the road the offense quieted down and the defense turned into a sieve. Their only two road wins came early in the season, both against a lowly Niagara team, and the resulting imbalance in play caused the Tigers to hover around the .500 mark for most of the season. RIT finished 5th in the conference and caused the team to travel for their quarterfinal meeting with Canisius. The result was nearly predictable and the Tigers were outscored 4–11 in the two games, ending their abbreviated season.\nDaniel Chenard sat out the season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Jayhawks, members of the Big 12 Conference, played their home games at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. They were led by 19th year Hall of Fame head coach Bill Self. The Jayhawks finished the season 34–6 and won their 4th NCAA Tournament National Championship, their first since 2008, and their 6th National Championship overall.\nSeason notes.\nThe Jayhawks experienced massive roster turnover in the offseason having lost eight players to transfers, graduation, and entering the draft, but added a recruiting class ranked in the top 15 of every major recruiting website, and 4 transfers. They had more new players on their roster than returning players. Despite the turnover, the Jayhawks entered the season with high expectations. Joe Lunardi of ESPN projected them as a 1 seed in his initial 2022 NCAA tournament bracketology. The Jayhawks renewed their rivalry with Missouri on December 11. The Jayhawks defeated Missouri 102–65.\nOn April 2, 2021, Kansas signed Self to a lifetime contract. The contract will automatically add an extra year to every year he coaches until his retirement or death.\nOn October 14, 2021, when the Big 12 Preseason Media Poll was published, Kansas was projected to finish first in conference standings, which is the 19th time in 26 seasons of the Big 12's existence that the Jayhawks have been selected as the preseason favorite. They received 8 first-place votes and 80 total points.\nThe Associated Press (AP) released their preseason poll on October 18, 2021. The Jayhawks were ranked 3rd in the preseason poll. It was the 10th consecutive, 16th under Bill Self, and 24th time since the 1992-93 season KU was ranked 7th or higher in the preseason AP poll. It was also the 16th consecutive season KU was ranked in the preseason poll. It also marked KU being ranked in the preseason poll 31 of the previous 32 seasons.\nAfter losing to Baylor on February 26 and TCU on March 1, the Jayhawks lost back-to-back games, which is only the 12th losing streak of any length under Self.\nThe Jayhawks defeated Texas on March 5 to clinch their 63rd regular season conference title, extending their NCAA record. It was also their 20th Big 12 title. It was also the 16th Big 12 title in the previous 18 seasons. The Jayhawks would also win the 2022 Big 12 tournament to earn their 50th NCAA Tournament appearance and their NCAA record extending 32nd consecutive. The tournament title was the Jayhawks 12th Big 12 Tournament title and their 16th overall.\nAfter defeating Providence in the NCAA tournament, Kansas passed Kentucky to be the winningest program in the nation. The Jayhawks defeated North Carolina in the National Championship game 72–69 after trailing 25–40 at halftime. They trailed by as much as 16 completing the largest comeback in National Championship game history.\nRoster changes.\nEntered draft.\nBelow are players who declared for the NBA draft. The class given is what their class was for the 2020–21 season. Seniors from the previous season, due to receiving an extra year of eligibility from the NCAA, had to declare to intention to enter the draft. If a player goes undrafted, they are eligible to return.\nRoster.\nDue to the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA tournament because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NCAA granted 2021 seniors an extra year of eligibility. Mitch Lightfoot and Chris Teahan both returned for an extra year. Additionally, transfer Remy Martin took advantage of the extra year of eligibility by the NCAA.\nSchedule.\nCOVID-19 impact.\nUnlike the previous year, Kansas allowed full capacity crowds. The Jayhawks finished their non-conference schedule without any positive tests for COVID-19. They did, however, cancel two non-conference games and postpone a third conference game due to COVID-19 issues with their opponents. The non-conference games that were canceled were replaced with new opponents. The Jayhawks had their first confirmed case of COVID-19 on February 1, 2022, when Ochai Agbaji tested positive for the virus.\nResults.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=| Big 12 Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA Tournament\n "

Less than a month later, the Ivy League, Harvard's primary conference, announced that it was cancelling all winter sports for 2020–21. Additionally the schools would not be participating in any Spring sports until the end of February.

        "title": "2021 Chinese Professional Baseball League season",
        "text": "The 2021 Chinese Professional Baseball League season was the 32nd season of the Chinese Professional Baseball League, with an official slogan of \"United for Baseball\".\nThe re-activated Wei Chuan Dragons rejoined the major league 21 years after disbandment in 1999, marking the first time a CPBL season included more than four teams since the 2008 season. As CPBL Commissioner Wu Chih-yang termed out following the conclusion of the 2020 season, the general managers elected Vice President of the Legislative Yuan Tsai Chi-Chang as the new Commissioner.\nThe season started on March 13, with the opening game played, per tradition, by the prior season's championship series pair: the 2020 champion Uni-President Lions defeated CTBC Brothers at Tainan Municipal Baseball Stadium, 10–4. The season ended in late November, followed by a Taiwan Series rematch. The Brothers defeated the Lions in a four-game sweep to capture the 2021 championship.\nGame play.\nSeeing the 0.560~0.570 coefficient of restitution (COR) of the 2020 game balls created too much of an offense-leaning game, the General Managers decided on September 24, 2020, to reduce the COR of 2021 game balls to 0.550 and raise the stitch height from 5mm to 7mm. The league hoped that this would restore the balance between pitchers and hitters, and align with balls used by neighboring KBO and NPB leagues.\nAs COVID-19 pandemic still widespread around the world, the CDC and the League decided to retain restriction first implemented in the second half of 2020 season: the maximum attendance of the game was reduced to 78% of each stadium's seating capacity, but food and drink was allowed.\nLeague-organized pre-season games started on February 26, 2021, and ended on March 10. The regular season opening game played on March 13 at Tainan Municipal Baseball Stadium, with last season's champions Uni-President Lions hosting their 2020 Taiwan Series opponent the CTBC Brothers. Game #2 followed the next day with the Lions hosting the Wei Chuan Dragons at Tainan, this was the first major league game played by the Dragons since their disbandment in 1999.\nGame #21 played on March 26 with the Rakuten Monkeys hosting Uni-President Lions at Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium was suspended at the top of the 4th inning after one out due to poor visibility caused by dense fog. This was the first CPBL game to be suspended due to fog, and the second if included called games.\nThe first-half season schedule was published on February 10, with second-half pending the release of 2020 Summer Olympic Baseball Final Qualifier schedule. Following the finalization of the Final Olympic Baseball Qualifier schedule, which would be held between June 16 and 20 at Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium, the league decided on April 19 to postpone games previously scheduled on and after June 8 to later dates. Due to a recent spike in domestically transmitted coronavirus cases, the league announced on May 19 that it would suspend the season as long as level-3 health alert was in effect across Taiwan. The league considered but decided against resuming games on June 29 without fans in attendance, despite no opposition by the Central Epidemic Command Center to the CPBL's plan. The CBPL stated on July 12 that play could resume the next day, as teams had agreed to a number of preventative measures. These measures included the prohibition of fans and cheerleaders in the stadium, and a requirement for the staffs of all teams to live and remain in hotels, whether at home on the road, unless a game was being played. As the COVID-19 pandemic became less severe, the league allowed a thousand fans to attend games on August 7 and 8. Starting on August 10, fans were permitted to attend games starting August 10, as stadiums were to be filled up to 25 percent capacity. Attendees were required to check in via a QR code, wear masks at all times, and submit to disinfection and body temperature checks at stadium entrances. Though cheerleaders were also permitted to return to the games, bans on musical instruments and food consumption remained in place at the time.\nTaiwan Series.\nBecause the first half and second-half championships were won by different teams, the 2021 Taiwan Series, a best of seven series, was played. The first-half champions, the CTBC Brothers, faced the second-half champions, the Uni-President Lions, with the first game scheduled on November 27 and the seventh game on December 5. Games after the first four will only be played if necessary. The Brothers, by having a better yearly record, earned home field advantage, hosting games 1, 2, 6, and 7 at their home field, Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. The Lions hosted games 3 at Chengcing Lake Baseball Stadium, 4 and 5 at their home field, Tainan Municipal Baseball Stadium. \nThe series will be a rematch of the 2020 Taiwan Series which Lions won four games to three en route to their 10th Taiwan Series victory and first since 2013.\nThis year, the Brothers swept the Lions in four games.\nFor the second time, CPBL sold presenting sponsorship to the series. Chunghwa Telecom, which is the largest telecommunications company in Taiwan will be presenting sponsor of the Taiwan Series.\nThis series is officially known as the 2021 Taiwan Series Presented by Chunghwa Telecom.\nRules.\nAll regular season rules apply with the following exceptions:"

Despite the issues, Brown and most of ECAC Hockey were expecting to start playing some time in November.

On October 16, Yale raised the campus alert status from green to yellow when the 18th member of the men's ice hockey team tested positive. Less than a month later, the Ivy League, Brown's primary conference, announced that it was cancelling all winter sports for 2020–21. Additionally the schools would not be participating in any Spring sports until the end of February. The announcement was not particularly surprising, considering that, unlike other conference, the Ivy League does not rely on revenue generated from its athletic programs.\nBecause the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Brown's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required. Because of this, players who would have been members of Brown for the 2021 season had a pathway to leave the program and immediately play for another university.\nSchedule and Results.\nSeason Cancelled"

        "text": "David Cotton (born July 9, 1997) is an American professional ice hockey center who is currently playing for the Kansas City Mavericks in the ECHL. He was drafted by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft and signed with the team in March 2020 alongside his brother Jason.\nEarly life.\nCotton was born on July 9, 1997, in Parker, Texas to parents Peggy and Steve. Following in the footsteps of his two older brothers, Jason and Ryan, Cotton began playing roller hockey at a young age. He often played above his age group to remain on the same team as Jason.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nGrowing up in Parker, Texas, Cotton played junior ice hockey with the Dallas Ice Jets where he won the Kansas City SuperSeries and 2010 Tier II National Championship. Cotton began his high school career playing for the Colorado Thunderbirds in the Tier 1 Elite Hockey League where he attracted attention from scouts from Cushing Academy. He played his freshman season with the Thunderbirds before transferring to Cushing as a sophomore. Upon enrolling at Cushing, Cotton skated for both the school's team and the Boston Junior Bruins U18 team in the MHSL. While playing for the Penguins, Cotton scored 19 goals and 32 assists in 32 games and eight goals and three assists with the Bruins. By the conclusion of his sophomore season, Cotton committed to play NCAA Division I men's ice hockey with the Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey team.\nDuring the offseason prior to the 2014–15 season, Cotton was drafted in the 4th round, 61st overall, by the Dubuque Fighting Saints of the United States Hockey League (USHL). He chose to return to Cushing and endured a breakout season where he recorded 27 goals and 42 assists in 33 games for the Penguins. He helped the team qualify for the Elite 8 tournament where they were swept by Dexter Southfield School. Cotton was subsequently invited to the NHL Prospects Combine where he was measured at and was ranked 62nd overall amongst North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. He was subsequently drafted 169th overall by the Carolina Hurricanes at the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. During the second day of the draft, Cotton's mother Peggy suffered a Brain Arteriovenous Malformation and was hospitalized for 40 days and required emergency brain surgery. He missed part of the Hurricanes development camp to remain by his mother's bedside.\nCollegiate.\nCotton began his freshman season at Boston College with the assistance of the Heffes Family Men's Hockey Scholarship Fund. While enrolled in the Morrissey College of Arts &amp; Sciences, Cotton led all team freshmen in goals, assists, power-play goals, game-winning goals, and points. However, he struggled with the transition to college and found it difficult to maintain good grades while playing DI hockey.\nCotton returned to the Eagles for his junior season where he continued his scoring dominance. On October 13, 2018, Cotton recorded his first collegiate hat-trick during a 7–5 loss to the Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey team. He concluded the season with a career-high 21 goals and ranked seventh nationally in goals per game. As a result, he was selected for the First Team Hockey East All-Star, Second Team All-American, and New England Division I All-Star Team. During the offseason, Cotton did not seek a contract offer from Carolina but attended their 2019 Development Camp.\nWhen he returned to college for his senior year and his first as team captain, Cotton played in 32 games and ranked third on the team in scoring with a career-high 39 points. He ranked third in the conference with 13 multi-point games including a multi-goal effort in the Beanpot Semifinal against Boston University. He was subsequently nominated for the Hobey Baker Award and named the male winner of the 2020 Eagle of the Year Award.\nProfessional.\nOn March 24, 2020, Cotton concluded his collegiate career and signed with the Carolina Hurricanes to an entry-level contract alongside his brother. His two-year, two-way contract was worth $700,000 in 2020-21 and $832,500 in 2021–22 at the NHL level and $70,000 at the American Hockey League (AHL) level. When the AHL resumed play in 2021, Cotton and Jason were reassigned to the Chicago Wolves and eventually became the second set of brothers to play in the same game for the Wolves.\nAs a free agent following his entry-level contract with the Hurricanes, Cotton was later signed approaching the 2022–23 season, to a one-year AHL contract for the inaugural season of the Coachella Valley Firebirds on September 22, 2022. Cotton made just two appearances with the Firebirds over the opening quarter of the season before he was traded by Coachella to the San Diego Gulls in exchange for future considerations on December 8, 2022. \nAs a free agent from the Gulls, Cotton was unable to secure an AHL contract, opting to sign a deal with the Florida Everblades of the ECHL on August 29, 2023. In the 2023–24 season, Cotton registered just 2 assists through the opening 7 games with the Everblades, before he was traded to the Kansas City Mavericks on November 26, 2023. "

He played with the Philadelphia Black Meteors, the Otto Briggs All Stars, and the Homestead Grays.\nCareer.\nFrom the team's inception in 1933, Anderson appears to have been a key component in the Meteors' success, eventually leading to an ultimately unsuccessful bid to acquire him by the 1934 Negro NL champion Philadelphia Stars. In July 1936, the \"Philadelphia Tribune\" reported:\n\"The Stars are after Saddler of the Briggs Meteors and \"Schoolboy\" Anderson. But the newly elected associate Otto Briggs has told Webster McDonald to lay hands off, they're his boys.\"\nMoreover, the value assigned Philadelphia's \"schoolboy twirler\" did not derive solely from his mound exploits, as evidenced by a number of contemporaneous news items (including one featuring what may well be the only published photograph of Anderson), documenting not merely some degree of batting prowess, but also the fact that, in at least a handful of Meteors games, he started in either right, left or center field.\nExternal links.\n and Baseball-Reference Black Baseball Stats and Seamheads "

Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Morehead State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

Uganda recovered from a poor start to their run chase, led by a century for Ronak Patel, but were eventually all out 98 runs short of Namibia's total.

Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Clarkson's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nClarkson was up and down all season, ending their non-conference schedule with just a 5–3 record despite playing mostly Atlantic Hockey teams. The offense began to sputter once the team began its conference slate but the goaltending was strong enough to keep them in most games. Clarkson ended the season in second place in the conference and was on the bubble to make the NCAA Tournament. Just as the team was getting ready to play in the ECAC Hockey Tournament, several team members gathered on campus, violating the school's COVID-19 protocols. As a result, the school ended the team's season and caused the Golden Knights to withdraw from postseason competition.

        "text": "Richard kennedy is a Canadian retired ice hockey winger and coach who was the NCAA Scoring Champion in 1972–73.\nCareer.\nKennedy was enticed to join the fairly new program at Saint Louis University in 1971 due to knowing that, being a new program, he could play top minutes straight away and that the Billikens played their home games in the St. Louis Arena, the home of the St. Louis Blues. After a decent freshman season, Kennedy's numbers exploded in his sophomore campaign; he led the nation in goals (47), assists (49) and points (96), leading the country's best offense to the top of the CCHA. Unfortunately, due to the low regard for the conference by most of college hockey, Kennedy's accomplishments went unrecognized outside of the CCHA. Due to this lack of respect, Saint Louis knew the conference tournament would be the end of their season. Despite dominating during the season, Saint Louis lost the opening game to Bowling Green and had to settle for second place.\nAs an upperclassmen, Kennedy's numbers declined as the team's strength of schedule improved but the Billikens were much more focused come playoff time, winning consecutive CCHA championships with Kennedy being named to the All-CCHA teams three years running. After graduating Kennedy played one season of senior hockey before hanging up his skates. He eventually became the head coach at Christian Brothers College and led the team to four MSCHA championships. He was inducted into the St. Louis Amateur Hockey Hall of Fame in 2010."

Despite the issues, Yale and most of ECAC Hockey were expecting to start playing some time in November. After the team had assembled and began practicing, however, a sizable number of Bulldog players tested positive for coronavirus. On October 16, Yale raised the campus alert status from green to yellow when the 18th member of the men's ice hockey team tested positive. Less than a month later, the Ivy League, Yale's primary conference, announced that it was cancelling all winter sports for 2020–21. Additionally the schools would not be participating in any Spring sports until the end of February. The announcement was not particularly surprising, considering that, unlike other conference, the Ivy League does not rely on revenue generated from its athletic programs.\nBecause the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Yale's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required. Because of this, players who would have been members of Yale for the 2021 season had a pathway to leave the program and play for another university.\nWhile all Ivy League teams were shut down, the cancellation of Yale's ice hockey season was particularly galling. World Wars, the Great Depression and even their own home rink burning down had never completely hindered the Elis before but, for the first time in 125 years, Yale University would not play an official ice hockey game due to COVID-19.\nSchedule and results.\nSeason Cancelled"

        "text": "The European qualifying competition for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup was a women's football competition that determined the eleven UEFA teams which directly qualified for the final tournament in Australia and New Zealand, and the one team which advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs.\nFifty-one of the 55 UEFA member national teams entered the qualifying competition, with Cyprus making their World Cup qualifying debut and Luxembourg appearing in a group stage for the first time ever.\nFormat.\nThe qualifying competition consists of two rounds:\nTiebreakers.\nIn the group stage, teams were ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss), and if tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings (Regulations Article 13.01):\nTo determine the best three runners-up, the group standings were used, not taking into account any matches against sixth-placed teams. If teams were tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied (Regulations Article 14.04):\nIn the play-offs, the team that scored more goals in the second round match qualified for the final tournament. If the score was level, extra time was played. If the score remained level after extra time, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out (Regulations Article 15.01).\nTo determine the two best play-off winners, the results of the group stage as used for runner-up determination above (eight matches), and the second round of the play-offs (one match) were added. The following criteria were applied (Regulations Article 14.05):\nSchedule.\nThe qualifying matches were played on dates that fell within the FIFA Women's International Match Calendar.\nSince the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 tournament was moved from summer 2021 to that of 2022 because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, for the first time the series of matches for UEFA's World Cup qualification were interrupted by a continental championship. In July 2022 sixteen UEFA national teams participated in the Women's Euro tournament in England.\nEntrants.\nThe teams were ranked according to their coefficient ranking, calculated based on the following (Regulations Annex B.1.2.a):\nOne entrant, Russia, was initially given a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on 9 December 2019 after Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated laboratory data to investigators. However, the Russian women's team could still have entered qualification. The decision was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which ruled in WADA's favour but reduced the ban to two years. The CAS ruling also allowed the name \"Russia\" to be displayed on uniforms if the words \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\" had equal prominence. Had Russia qualified for the tournament, its female players would have been able to use their country's name, flag and anthem at the Women's World Cup, unlike their male counterparts, as the ban was set to expire on 16 December 2022. However, Russia were suspended from the tournament following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and later expelled from all ongoing FIFA and UEFA competitions.\nOn 20 April 2021, it was announced 51 teams from the 55 eligible would enter the qualifying round.\nNational teams which qualified directly for the final tournament were indicated in bold, national teams which qualified for the final tournament through the UEFA play-offs were indicated in bold italics, and the national team which qualified for the inter-confederation play-offs was indicated in \"italics\".\nGroup stage.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 30 April 2021 at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. The 51 teams were drawn into 9 groups:\nBased on the UEFA Executive Committee decisions due to political conflicts, there were several combinations of teams (Armenia and Azerbaijan, Russia and Ukraine, Serbia and Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, Russia and Kosovo) that could not be drawn into the same group. One of these was Armenia, who were initially drawn into group E together with Azerbaijan. Armenia was moved into group F and Montenegro was then drawn into group E.\nGroups.\nGroup E.\nOn 28 February 2022, FIFA and UEFA announced that Russia was suspended from all competitions. On 2 May 2022, UEFA announced that Russia would no longer be allowed to take part in the competition, that their previous results were nullified, and that Group E would continue with five teams.\nRanking of second-placed teams.\nSince some groups had six teams and others had five, matches against the sixth-placed team in the groups with six teams were not counted.\nQualified teams.\nThe following twelve teams from UEFA qualified for the final tournament.\nTop goalscorers.\n\"For full lists of goalscorers, see sections in each group:\""

This came to light during the China–Lithuania relations crisis, after the Republic of China (Taipei or Taiwan) opened its representative office in Vilnius under the name of \"Taiwan\" (the first under this name in Europe) in August 2021. In response, the People's Republic of China recalled its ambassador in Vilnius, Shen Zhifei, and demanded that Lithuania recall its ambassador in Beijing, Diana Mickevičienė. \nTrade between the two countries was seriously disrupted. Relations between the PRC and Lithuania were downgraded to the level of chargé d'affaires on 21 November 2021.\nDaina Gudzinevičiūtė, president of the Lithuanian National Olympic Committee, released a statement that the Olympic Games should be politically neutral and confirmed that committee had no plans to boycott the games.\nOn the 3rd of December 2021, Lithuania was the first nation to announce a diplomatic boycott of the games.\nAlpine skiing.\nBy meeting the basic qualification standards Lithuania qualified one male and one female alpine skier.\nBiathlon.\nBased on their Nations Cup ranking in the 2021–22 Biathlon World Cup, Lithuania qualified 4 men.\nCross-country skiing.\nLithuania has qualified the basic quotas in men's and women's events.\nFigure skating.\nIn the 2021 World Figure Skating Championships in Stockholm, Sweden, Lithuania secured one quota in the ice dance competition. Allison Reed and Saulius Ambrulevičius were originally announced to represent Lithuania in the Winter Olympics; however, American-born Reed's application for Lithuanian citizenship was denied, and the pair was subsequently replaced by Paulina Ramanauskaitė and Deividas Kizala."

        "text": "The Sri Lanka cricket team toured the West Indies during March and April 2021 to play two Test matches, three One Day International (ODI) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The Tests formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship, and the ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.\nIn February 2021, Sri Lanka's coach Mickey Arthur and batsman Lahiru Thirimanne returned positive COVID-19 tests. This resulted in several media reports stating that the tour had been postponed. However, the following day, Cricket West Indies (CWI) announced their upcoming broadcast deal to show live cricket in the Caribbean, starting with hosting Sri Lanka across all three formats. On 16 February 2021, both cricket boards confirmed the dates for the fixtures.\nSri Lanka Cricket also formally appointed Dasun Shanaka as their T20I captain, replacing Lasith Malinga. Shanaka had previously captained the T20I side in October 2019, against Pakistan. However, Shanaka did not depart for the tour with the rest of the team due to visa issues, with Angelo Mathews named as Sri Lanka's stand-in captain for the T20I matches. Sri Lanka Cricket issued a statement saying that Shanka is expected to join up with the team once his visa issue has been resolved.\nOn 26 February 2021, the West Indies named their squads for the limited overs matches. Chris Gayle and Fidel Edwards were recalled to the T20I team, after last playing for the national side two and nine years ago respectively. On 11 March 2021, CWI formally appointed Kraigg Brathwaite as their Test captain, replacing Jason Holder. Brathwaite had previously captained the West Indies team in seven Tests.\nOn 2 March 2021, CWI named the match officials for the tour. Joel Wilson, who has been the on-field umpire for 19 Tests prior to the tour, stood in his first Test match at home. Gregory Brathwaite also made his debut as an on-field umpire in Test cricket.\nThe West Indies won the first T20I match by four wickets, with Sri Lanka winning the second match by 43 runs to level the series. The West Indies won the final match by three wickets to win the series 2–1. The West Indies won the first two ODI matches to win the series with a game to go. They went on to win the final match by five wickets, to take the series 3–0. Both Test matches finished as draws, therefore the series was also drawn 0–0.\nSquads.\nAhead of the tour, Lahiru Kumara was ruled out of Sri Lanka's white-ball squad due to a positive test for COVID-19, with Suranga Lakmal named as his replacement. Sri Lanka's Dasun Shanaka missed the T20I matches, after he was unable to travel due to visa issues. On 5 March 2021, Sri Lanka Cricket issued a statement stating that Shanka would join up with the team for the ODI matches. Prior to the second ODI match, Angelo Mathews left Sri Lanka's squad for the rest of the tour to return home due to a family matter. Ahead of the third ODI, Anderson Phillip was added to the West Indies' squad.\nOn 12 March 2021, Cricket West Indies named the squad for the first Test match, with Roston Chase, Jahmar Hamilton and Chemar Holder named as reserves and Jayden Seales as a developmental player.\nStatistics.\nMost wickets (Test).\nBangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2020–21"

        "text": "Champions Retreat Golf Club, is a 27 hole, private golf club, located in Evans, Georgia, United States 14 miles from Augusta National Golf Club. It is the only course in the world with three nines designed by Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player, the Big Three of Masters fame who combine for 13 Masters titles, 34 Major victories and 159 tournament wins.\nIn 2019, the course began co-hosting the Augusta National Women's Amateur along with Augusta National Golf Club.\nHistory.\nLegendary professional golfer Gary Player chose the 1999 Masters Champions Dinner as his setting to recruit two other greats – Jack Nicklaus and the late Arnold Palmer – to share in his dream of a 27-hole, private golf club located just outside of Augusta, Georgia. Nestled along the Savannah River, the three nine-hole courses inhabit a former untouched timber plot and are built around an Island, a Bluff, and a Creek.\nThe legends designed nine signature holes of championship golf together, sculpting from the foundation of more than 365 acres of skyward Georgia pines, long-standing hardwood, and wetlands. Opening its doors in 2005, Champions Retreat is the realization of their collective vision.\nThe three nine-hole courses inhabit a former untouched timber plot and are built around an Island, a Bluff, and a Creek. With three distinct properties to choose from, Gary Player handled the designation of the land by writing “Island,” “Creek” and “Bluff” on the back of three index cards. Arnold Palmer had the most seniority and had played in more Masters than Jack Nicklaus or Gary Player, so he selected first. He drew the “Island” card. Jack Nicklaus drew second since he had won more green jackets than Gary Player and pulled the “Bluff” card, leaving Player with the “Creek” property.\nAugusta National Women's Amateur.\nThe Augusta National Women's Amateur was announced in April 2018 by Augusta National Chairman Fred Ridley during his annual press conference at the 2018 Master's Tournament. The 54-hole, stroke-play tournament will feature an international field of 72 amateur woman players. Invitees were determined by awarding winners of other recognized championships and using the Women’s World Amateur Golf Ranking.\nAugusta National Women's Amateur 2019.\nIn the inaugural event, Champions Retreat Golf Club hosted the first 36 holes over two days on Arnold Palmer’s Island nine and Jack Nicklaus’ Bluff nine. The entire field then plays Augusta National for an official practice round followed by the final round taking place at Augusta National. The final round features the top 30 competitors who made the cut. In the event of a tie after 54 holes, the winner will be decided by a sudden-death playoff.\nNBC Sports provided pre-event promotion across NBCUniversal’s portfolio, while Golf Channel delivered the highlights, live reports, and news coverage throughout the event, including onsite during the first two competitive rounds at Champions Retreat.\nAugusta National Women's Amateur 2020.\nAugusta National Women's Amateur 2020 didn't take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAugusta National Women's Amateur 2021.\nIn a statement issued on January 12, 2021, Fred Ridley, Chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, announced that the Club intends to conduct the Augusta National Women’s Amateur and the Drive, Chip, and Putt National Finals as scheduled. Both of these competitions also intend to host a small number of patrons. Augusta National Women's Amateur 2021 took place from March 31 to April 3.\nSeventeen-year-old Tsubasa Kajitani became the first international ANWA champion, and the first winner from Japan at Augusta National in any tournament, with her playoff victory over Wake Forest's Emilia Migliaccio in 2021. The following week Japan's Hideki Matsuyama won the Masters.\nAugusta National Women's Amateur 2022.\nThe Augusta National Women’s Amateur was held in 2022. The first 36 holes were contested over two days on the Island and Bluff nines at Champions Retreat Golf Club in Evans, Georgia on March 30 and 31, 2022. The entire field then played Augusta National for an official practice round Friday, April 1. The final round took place at Augusta National on Saturday, April 2.\nIn her first appearance at the Augusta National Women's Amateur, 16-year-old Anna Davis became the event's youngest champion in 2022 by shooting a 3-under 69 to finish at 1 under and win by a single stroke.\nAugusta National Women's Amateur 2023.\nAmerican Rose Zhang won the 2023 tournament after defeating Jenny Bae in a playoff.\nFacilities and grounds.\nChampions Retreat is acclaimed as one of the best golf properties in the United States. The property encompasses more than 365 acres of Georgia pines, long-standing hardwood, and wetlands. \nIsland.\nThe Island Nine at Champions Retreat shares the personality of Arnold Palmer’s architectural vision. The course is flanked on one side by the broad Savannah River and on the other by the Little River. The hardwoods and pines along the riverbank have been preserved, and the fairways have been raised to take advantage of the vistas overlooking the marshy waters.\nBluff.\nDesigned by Jack Nicklaus, The Bluff course features numerous mounds and rolling hills, with mature Georgia pines spread throughout. Very little dirt was moved during the construction process allowing the course to fit within the existing terrain and its surroundings. There is a great deal of variety in the routing, featuring uphill and downhill shots, as well as a balance of right-to-left and left-to-right holes.\nCreek.\nThe Creek course provides many opportunities for an experienced golfer. Designed by Gary Player, the opening four holes play in a wetland area while the remaining part of the course moves upland through native hardwood trees. Adding difficulty, the ninth plays over and around a large lake on the right, allowing players to finish with a variety of shots."

He played junior hockey and lead the junior-B level in scoring as a member of the Owen Sound Greys during the 1970–71 season. Burlington attended Boston University and, despite the NCAA having changed their rules, the Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey team had their first-year players serve on a freshman team. Burlington joined the varsity squad, but the team was upset by Pennsylvania in the first round of the conference tournament. \nAfter the 1973 season, BU was forced to forfeit 11 games for after using an ineligible player, leading to the firing of coach Leon Abbott in the middle of Burlington's junior year. New head coach Jack Parker eventually lead the Terriers to an ECAC championship in 1974. Burlington was named an All-American for the season. In his first NCAA tournament appearance, Burlington's team fell 4–5 in the semifinal to eventual champion Minnesota and finished third in the four-team field. During Burlington's senior season, the Terriers won an ECAC championship and finishing third in the NCAA Tournament.\nCareer.\nAfter BU, Burlington continued his playing career and sought to win an Allan Cup. While playing senior hockey, Burlington took time off to earn his B.A. from Lakehead University in 1978 but his playing career was ended abruptly after a serious injury in 1980. Burlington was slashed on the jaw, breaking the bone in seven places.\nBurlington and his wife Cheryl travelled to the Northwest Territories and began pursuing careers as educators. Bill became a gym teacher at Sir John Franklin High School in Yellowknife and spent more than 25 years teaching at the school. While coaching both the boys and girls hockey teams, Burlington continued to playing, winning four gold medals in hockey at the Arctic Winter Games."

Golf course architect Martin Hawtree was commissioned to design the course drawing on inspiration from the legendary British golf courses of the 1920s, and the 18-hole course in open links-style layout was completed in July 2009.\n\"Svensk Golf\", official publication of the Swedish Golf Federation, in 2020 ranked the course #7 in Sweden using the \"Golf Digest\" methodology.\nIn 2021 the club hosted its first major event, the Scandinavian Mixed hosted by Henrik Stenson and Annika Sörenstam. Sanctioned jointly by the European Tour and Ladies European Tour, the tournament for the first time brought together 78 men and 78 women to compete in the same tournament, playing from different tees, for the same prize money. By dividing the results, Official World Golf Ranking points were offered for both tours, along with points toward the European Tour's and LET's respective season-long Order of Merit competitions."

The Stotesbury Cup is the largest regatta for high school rowing, and the Scholastic Rowing Association of America also holds a championship regatta open to schools in North America.\nU.S. high school crews have been successful internationally, with winners of the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup in 14 of the 73 years it has been awarded.\nHistory.\nRowing was one of the earliest sports to be popular in the United States, practiced as early as 1860 at Phillips Exeter Academy, along with baseball, football, and cricket, largely on the initiative of the students rather than the school administration. St. Paul's School students formed two boat clubs in 1871 (Halcyon and Shattuck) which have raced each other annually ever since. Philadelphia students, with the help of the Schuylkill Navy, formed the Interscholastic Rowing League in 1897, and the Boston Athletic Association offered rowing for high schoolers in 1898. The Philadelphia Interscholastic League added crew as a sport in 1902. In New York, the Harlem Regatta Association added a scholastic eight-oared event in 1907. However, the Public Schools Athletic League soon dropped the sport due to its expense. The expense of the sport caused it to fail to gain wide popularity in high schools in the nineteenth century. Rowing, along with the \"country club\" sports of golf and tennis, was a popular sport for American prep schools in the 1920s, especially in the mid-Atlantic and New England.\nThe American Henley Regatta added an eight-oared schoolboy event in 1904, and this was considered the national championships for secondary schools. \nWith public schools increasingly dropping crew due to its expense, prep schools dominated the American Henley scholastic races. The Stotesbury Cup was created in 1927 for Philadelphia schools. However, the scholastic event was removed from American Henley in 1932, leading the Stotesbury Cup to open itself to national competition. In 1935, the newly formed Schoolboy Rowing Association of America also offered a national championship regatta in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nList of scholastic regattas.\nRegional.\nThe following are scholastic regattas. These either do not allow club crews, or give separate awards to scholastic and non-scholastic winners"

        "text": "The 2021 FEI World Cup Finals for both dressage and show jumping were scheduled to be held between March 30 and April 4, 2021 in Gothenburg, Sweden. The event was to be held in the Scandinavium Arena and should have represented the conclusion of the 2020-21 Dressage and Show jumping World Cup Seasons.\nThe Finals got cancelled on March 12, due to the EHV-1 outbreak in Europe.\nBackground.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 FEI World Cup Finals in Las Vegas got cancelled on short notice. It was the first time that the FEI World Cup Finals got cancelled since their inclusion in 1978 for show jumping, and 1985 for dressage.\nThe pandemic affected the 2020-21 World Cup Seasons in both dressage and jumping. Numerous qualifiers, including the complete Western European and North American jumping circuits, got scratched. This forced the FEI to introduce new qualifying procedures for the Finals in Gothenburg.\nIn February 2021, an outbreak of an aggressive strain of the neurological form of Equine Herpes Virus (EHV-1) was reported in Valencia, Spain. This caused the International Equestrian Federation to cancel all competition on the European mainland through March 28. The outbreak put the 2021 FEI World Cup Finals under uncertainty, and the competition eventually got cancelled once the cancellation period got extended to April 11.\nDressage.\nQualification.\nThe list of qualified athletes was released on March 11, 2021.\nShow jumping.\nQualification.\nFor the show jumping, due to a number of cancelled qualifiers, most qualification spots for the Finals have been distributed to national federations (NFs) rather than specific athletes. National federations are tasked with the athlete selection."

It has hosted the Compaq Open on the Ladies European Tour.\nHistory.\nOpened in 1988 and co-designed by Sven Tumba and Jan Sederholm, the club was one of few in Sweden ambitious enough to build 36 holes at the outset. It hosted national and international tournaments throughout the 1990s. \nBy 2015 the club worried it could not keep pace with the new championship courses built in the Stockholm metropolitan area. In 2016 it sold a parcel of land to real estate developers, which enabled it to invest $25 million in a major revamp of the facilities. Henrik Stenson Golf Design was commissioned to create one of the finest golfing facilities in Scandinavia, drawing on inspiration from Le Nationale and TPC Sawgrass.\nConstruction of the new East course begun in 2016 and was completed in 2018, now renamed \"Öster by Stenson\". The West course will open after remodeling in 2022. Following the rewamp \"Svensk Golf\", official publication of the Swedish Golf Federation, in 2020 ranked the Öster by Stenson course #8 in Sweden using the \"Golf Digest\" methodology.\nThe most notable player representing the club is PGA Tour winner Richard S. Johnson.\nThe club hosted the Ladies European Tour event Compaq Open on three occasions, featuring the biggest European stars of the day with winners such as Annika Sörenstam and Laura Davies. The European Amateur Team Championship was held here in 2010, which saw Tommy Fleetwood lead England to victory over a Swedish team with David Lingmerth and Henrik Norlander."

        "text": "Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics was held at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing, China. The five events took place between 4 and 20 February 2022.\nA total of 144 quota spots were distributed to the sport of figure skating, a decline of four from the 2018 Olympic Winter Games. From the 2021–22 season, the International Skating Union renamed \"ladies' singles\" as \"women's singles\".\nA total of five events were contested, one for men, one for women and three mixed. \nQualification.\nA total of 144 quota spots are available to athletes to compete at the games. Each NOC can enter a maximum of 18 athletes, with a maximum of nine men or nine women. An additional five quota spots have been made available for, first host qualification, then if any are remaining, the team event.\nOn the issue of the disqualification of participating athletes at the Winter Olympics, the ISU has issued a statement regarding its policy regarding doping violations which may be alleged for the duration of the events of the Games stating that the, \"...International Skating Union cannot disclose any information about a possible anti-doping rule violation. This is regulated by the ISU anti-doping rules and the IOC anti-doping rules for the Beijing 2022 Olympics.\"\nCompetition schedule.\nThe following is the competition schedule for all five events. Sessions that include the event finals are shown in bold.\nAll times are in local time (UTC+8), according to the official schedule correct as of January 2022. This schedule may be subject to change in due time.\nMedal summary.\nEvents.\n \"Skaters who only competed in the short program/rhythm dance.\"\n \"Skaters who only competed in the free skating/dance.\"\nEntries.\nCountries began announcing their selections following the 2021 World Championships. The International Skating Union published a complete list of entries on 26 January 2022. Names denoted with an asterisk (*) are skaters/teams eligible for the team event only.\nRecords and firsts.\nThe following new ISU best scores were set during this competition.\nTES = Technical Element Score&lt;br&gt;PCS = Program Component Score\nParticipating nations.\nThe following National Olympic Committees earned spots to compete, with the number of athletes in parentheses. 148 athletes from 32 NOCs are expected to participate. ROC was the only delegation to qualify the maximum number of entries (3 spots per discipline for 18 athletes total).\nControversy surrounding the ROC.\nThe medal ceremony for the team event, where the ROC won gold, originally scheduled for 8 February, was delayed over what International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams described as a situation that required \"legal consultation\" with the International Skating Union. Several media outlets reported on 9 February that the issue was over a positive test for trimetazidine by the ROC's Kamila Valieva, which was officially confirmed on 11 February. Valieva's sample in question was taken by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) at the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships on 25 December, but the sample was not analyzed at the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) laboratory where it was sent for testing until 8 February, one day after the team event concluded.\nValieva was assessed a provisional suspension after her positive result, but upon appeal, she was cleared by RUSADA's independent Disciplinary Anti-Doping Committee (DAC) on 9 February, just a day after receiving the provisional suspension. Following formal appeals lodged by the IOC, the International Skating Union (ISU), and WADA to review RUSADA DAC's decision, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) heard the case on 13 February, and removal of her provisional suspension was upheld on 14 February, ahead of her scheduled appearance in the women's singles event beginning 15 February. Due to Valieva being a minor at the time, as well as being classified as a \"protected person\" under WADA guidelines, RUSADA and the IOC announced on 12 February that they would broaden the scope of their respective investigations to include members of her entourage (e.g. coaches, team doctors, etc.).\nOn 14 February, the CAS declined to reinstate Valieva's provisional suspension and ruled that she would be allowed to compete in the women’s singles event. The CAS decided that preventing her from competing \"would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances\", while noting that any medals won by Valieva at the Beijing Olympics would be withheld pending the results of the continuing investigation into her doping violation. The accommodating decision from the court, still subject to further and on-going investigation, was made on three grounds: 1/ Due to her age, she is a \"Protected Person\" as per WADA Code, subject to different rules than adult athletes; 2/ Athlete \"did not test positive during the Olympic Games in Beijing; 3/ \"There were serious issues of untimely notification of the results, ... which impinged upon the Athlete’s ability to establish certain legal requirements for her benefit\". The IOC announced that the team event medal ceremony, as well as the women's singles flower ceremony and medal ceremony if Valieva were to medal, would not take place until the investigation is over, and there is a concrete decision whether to strip Valieva and the ROC of their medals. To allow for the possibility that Valieva's results may be disqualified, the IOC asked the ISU to expand the qualifying field for the women's singles free skating by one to 25, contingent upon Valieva being one of the top 24 skaters after the short program.\nOn 15 February, after the women's short program, \"The New York Times\" reported that Valieva's sample tested positive for an additional two substances, hypoxen and L-Carnitine, which are not on the banned list, in addition to trimetazidine. Antidoping officials called the discovery of multiple substances in any athlete's sample \"highly unusual\", particularly in an athlete as young as Valieva. Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, called the combination of three heart medications a \"trifecta of substances...[which] seem to be aimed at increasing endurance, reducing fatigue and promoting greater efficiency in using oxygen\". By the end of the Beijing Olympics, a total five athletes were reported for doping violations. By 9 March 2022, Tygart of the USADA further reported that Valieva had not requested that her \"B\" sample be tested, apparently accepting the results of initial testing and relying on her explanation that the banned substance trimetazidine belonged to her grandfather and only accidentally contaminated or became mixed into her own use of allowed nutrients and supplements. Tygart further stated that as a minor Valieva could still be either fully exculpated or given a warning concerning her testing positive depending on the extent of findings in the on-going RUSADA investigation of doping. According to Tygart, an adverse finding against her as a first offense could still be assessed as a two year suspension, which is half of the suspension time which could be assessed for adults.\nAlthough Russia as a country is currently banned from participating in international skating events due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Valieva has continued to compete within Russian borders without being hindered by RUSADA as recently as the Russian Grand Prix held in October 2022. In mid-November, WADA requested that CAS take up the review of the Valieva case with an eye towards a 4-year suspension of Valieva, which would exclude her from competition at the next Winter Olympics, and to rescind her first place performance at the previous Beijing Olympics because, \"the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) did not meet a WADA-imposed Nov. 4 deadline to deliver a verdict on Valiyeva's case.\""

        "title": "Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification",
        "text": "The following is about the qualification rules and allocation of spots for the figure skating events at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nQualification system.\nA total of 144 quota spots are available to athletes to compete at the games. A maximum of 18 athletes can be entered by a National Olympic Committee, with a maximum of 9 men or 9 women. There is also an \"Additional Athletes Quota\" which allows up to a maximum of 5 more total skaters, bringing the potential total to 149. The host (China) is the priority for these additional places so that if they have met minimum standards they may have an entry in each event, other than the team event. If unused, these five quotas can be used to qualify nations for the team event if they only need an entry in one more discipline.\nSkater qualification.\nThere is no individual athlete qualification to the Olympics; the choice of which athlete(s) to send to the Games is at the discretion of each country's National Olympic Committee. Each country is allowed a maximum of three entries per discipline, resulting in a maximum of 18 athletes (nine men and nine women) possible per country.\nAccording to ISU rules, countries must select their entries from among skaters who have achieved a minimum technical elements score (TES) at an ISU-recognized international competition on or before 24 January 2022.\nOn the issue of the disqualification of participating athletes at the Winter Olympics, the ISU has issued a statement regarding its policy regarding doping violations which may be alleged for the duration of the events of the Games stating that the, “...International Skating Union cannot disclose any information about a possible anti-doping rule violation. This is regulated by the ISU anti-doping rules and the IOC anti-doping rules for the Beijing 2022 Olympics.”\nCountry qualification.\nThe number of entries for the figure skating events at the Olympic Games is limited by a quota set by the International Olympic Committee. A total of 144 quota spots are available to athletes to compete at the games. There will be 30 skaters in the disciplines of men's and women's singles, 19 pair skating teams, and 23 ice dance teams. Additionally, ten nations qualify for the team event.\nCountries will be able to qualify entries to the 2022 Winter Olympics in two ways. Most spots are allocated based on the results of the 2021 World Championships. At the event, countries were able to qualify up to three entries in each discipline according to the usual system in place; countries which earned multiple spots to the Olympics also earned multiple spots to the 2022 World Championships, although the World Championships were not subject to the requirement that for 2/3 entries, countries must additionally qualify 2/3 skaters into the free segment. Every discipline qualifies independently.\nAt the World Championships, the system was as follows:\nQualification spots available per tournament.\nThe results of the 2021 World Championships determined 83 total spots: 24 entries in each singles discipline, 16 in pairs, and 19 in ice dance. The available spots were awarded going down the results list, with multiple spots being awarded first.\nThe remainder of the spots will be filled at the Nebelhorn Trophy in Oberstdorf, Germany in late September 2021. Countries that had already earned an entry to the Olympics were not allowed to qualify additional entries at this final qualifying competition. However, if a country earned two or three spots at the World Championships, but did not have two or three skaters, respectively, qualify for the free skate, then they were allowed to send a skater who did not reach the free segment at World Championships to Nebelhorn to qualify the remaining spot(s). Unlike at the World Championships, where countries could qualify more than one spot depending on the placement of their skater(s), at the Nebelhorn Trophy, countries could earn only one spot per discipline, regardless of ranking.\nInitially, a total of six spots per singles event, three spots in pairs, and four in ice dance were available at Nebelhorn Trophy. One additional quota spot became available in men's singles following the 2021 World Championships. If a country declines to use one or more of its qualified spots, the vacated spot is awarded using the results of Nebelhorn Trophy in descending order of placement.\nFor the team trophy, scores from the 2021 World Figure Skating Championships and the 2021–22 Grand Prix season, will be tabulated to establish the ten top nations. Each nation compiles a score from their top performers in each of the four disciplines. The Grand Prix Final, to be held in early December 2021, was to be the final event to affect the Team Trophy score, before it was cancelled.\nQualification summary.\nNext eligible NOC per event.\nIf a country rejects a quota spot then additional quotas become available. A country can be eligible for one quota spot per event in the reallocation process. Countries in bold indicate the country later received a quota spot. The following list is compiled after the remaining spots were allocated at the 2021 CS Nebelhorn Trophy. There were no alternates for the team event because no additional NOCs beyond the qualified ten met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the event."

        "title": "George Gardiner (rugby league)",
        "text": "George Gardiner was a New Zealand rugby league representative player. He played for New Zealand in 1926 becoming the 185th New Zealand representative. He was also a Bay of Plenty rugby representative as well as playing for the first ever Bay of Plenty rugby league team. After he finished his rugby league career he became a professional wrestler fighting mainly in Australia. He fought in World War 1 for New Zealand and fought and died serving in the Australian forces in World War 2.\nEarly life.\nIt is difficult to know George Gardiner's precise date of birth as it was given as 1 February 1894 on his enlistment papers for World War 1. However, this was a fake date which enabled him to be accepted into the forces. Later when he enlisted in the Australian forces for World War 2 he gave his date of birth as 3 August 1903. In an article from the Bay of Plenty Times on 16 April 1917 about his special medal during World War 1 he was said to be 19 years old. His obituary also stated that he was playing rugby for Matakana seniors in 1914 aged 16. Both of these articles suggest his birth year would have been around 1898.\nGardiner was born at Rangiwaea, Tauranga. His father was Karehana Gardener, and his mother was Rewa Gardiner. He belonged to the Ngāi Te Rangi iwi and was a member of the Catholic faith. He was a member of the Tauranga cadets until he left the Matakana Native School and became a mechanical engineer, and worked for Herbert Clark of Tauranga before the outbreak of World War 1.\nPlaying career.\nJunior rugby beginnings.\nGardiner began playing rugby at a young age, first playing for the Matakana juniors in 1912 aged around 14. He played for them against Star on 25 May 1912 in a 0–13 loss and was mentioned as being \"conspicuous\" in the losing side. He was a well known local athlete and competed at many local athletic events. In the 1913 season he began playing senior rugby for United and in 2 games for them in June he scored a try in each match against Paengaroa and Rangiuru respectively. He was then selected to play for the Te Puke sub-union representative team aged around 15. He played 3 matches for them, the first being in a 6–0 win against Tauranga. He then appeared in 2 losses against Rotorua (3-23, and 6-10). It was said that he played a \"good defensive game… but appeared to be rather weak on attack\". The 1914 season saw him starting for the Matakana seniors in a 7-aside competition on 5 June, and then in the forwards for the full side against Rangataua on 22 June in a Jordan Cup match. Then on 8 October he played in a match for the Tauranga sub-union team against the visiting Waihi. Gardiner scored a try in an easy 22–3 win.\nWorld War 1.\nWorld War 1 had broken out and Gardiner enlisted for the army. He served in the 1st Maori Contingent. He left Tauranga for Auckland on board the Ngapuhi to go into camp on 20 October. he commenced his duty on 2 February 1915 and spent 1915–16 in Egypt before moving to the Egyptian Eastern Front in 1916, and was at Gallipoli in 1915. He spent time on the Western Front from 1916, 17 and 18. Gardiner sent a letter home dated 2 December 1915 from the Dardanelles saying \"we are doing fine here; slow but sure. Mr Turk occasionally breaks out with fresh energy, but it is no use. What we have we hold, and I think the Turks are fed up with it. There have been a lot of prisoners taken including German officers, and if you take anything by looks they seem to be glad to be taken. They are a motley crowd, young and old. Some of them you would think hardly had enough strength to fight, but of course they are driven to it. We are all hoping that the war here will not last much longer, as the Turks are being hemmed in, and their casualties are heavy. I expect everybody at home is quite gloomy in finding no time for holidays, but I cannot see why they should be so. They ought to come out here for a week or two and see the antics of some of the boys. It would liven them up. I went to an open air concert behind the firing lines, and I can tell you there were some good turns, only every now and then the bag of a French battery would upset the programme\". He was wounded twice while at war in 1916 and 1917. Word was received in July 1916 by his father George Gardiner (snr) from the Minister of Defence, the Hon. James Allen that he had been \"slightly wounded in the head and face on 27 June\" but was remaining with his unit. In April 1917 Gardiner's father received word from the Minister of Defence once again however this time it was regarding an award he had won. He was \"awarded the Cross of Karageorge, First Class, for gallantry on the Field of action\". The cross was awarded by the King of Serbia.\nLate on in the war when he \"slipped over in a trench and hit his elbow so hard he was forced to recover in hospital\". Then in 1918 with the war drawing to a close Gardiner was selected to play in the New Zealand Maori Pioneer Battalion rugby team which played 7 matches in Egypt, 17 in continental Europe, and 7 in England with 29 wins and only 2 losses. Gardiner returned from the war on the Westmoreland in early April, 1919. After it arrived in Auckland he caught the Ngapuhi to the Bay of Plenty on 8 April where they were welcomed home by the mayor. Lieutenant Gardiner was in charge of the men and after the Reverend Waaka spoke to them Gardiner replied \"briefly\". Many relatives and friends of the men had travelled to Auckland to meet the men and travelled with them back to Tauranga.\nHe was awarded the 1914-1915 Star \"for distinguished services rendered during the course of the campaign\", the British War Medal (1914-1920), the Victory Medal, the Cross of Karageorge, 1st Class with Swords (Serbia), and the ANZAC Commemorative Medallion.\nPost war club and representative rugby career.\nNew Zealand Māori Pioneer Battalion tour of New Zealand.\nIn mid May the New Zealand Māori Pioneer Battalion team embarked on a nine match tour of New Zealand. Their first match was against Hawkes Bay at McLean Park, Napier on 17 May. They won the match 8 to 3 with Gardiner playing in the forwards. They then travelled to Otago and Southland though Gardiner not play in either of these two matches lost 6-9 and won 18-6 respectively. Their next match was against Canterbury on 31 May with Gardiner resuming his position in the forwards and leading the side. They lost the game 6–16 at the Addington Showgrounds in Christchurch. He didn't play in their drawn match with Wellington before next taking the field in Auckland against the local side. They again went down 11–22. He played again against Manawatu at Palmerston North where the Pioneers were 22-9 winners. He then scored his first try of the tour crossing the line to give them a 17–6 lead in an eventual 25–6 win over Hawke's Bay in Napier. Their final match of their tour was on 21 June against Poverty Bay at Childers Road Reserve in front of 3,000 spectators. Gardiner scored in the corner from a scrum and he converted his own try with the Pioneer side finishing with an entertaining 24–12 win.\nUnited, Te Puke, and Bay of Plenty.\nFollowing the Pioneer teams tour Gardiner joined the United club and played against Paengaroa on 30 June. In the meantime he had gone into business with Davis as tobacconist and billiard saloon proprietors. Their business was named simply ‘Davis &amp; Gardiner’ and they were based at the Alliance Hall in Te Puke. He played for United again against Rangataua before being selected for Te Puke to contest the Kusabs Cup against Whakatāne. The home team Te Puke won the match 5-0 meaning they would play Rotorua in the final. The Kusabs Cup final was played on the Arawa Park racecourse ground in Rotorua in front of a large crowd. Gardiner was heavily involved in many of Te Puke's attacks and he kicked a conversion in their comfortable 22–0 win. Gardiner then played against Rotorua again on 6 September at Te Puke. He scored their only try in a 3–6 loss where \"from loose play [he] forced his way across and touched down\" and was said to have played a \"slashing game\". His final appearance for Te Puke for the season came in a 29–3 win over Tauranga on 20 September. Te Puke won easily by 29 points to 3.\nGardiner was then selected to make his debut for the Bay of Plenty team in their match against Auckland on 27 September in the \"supports\" position. The match was played at Eden Park and saw Bay of Plenty upset the local side by 25 to 16 with Gardiner kicking a conversion.\nIn April 1920 he competed as a runner for Te Puke at the Tauranga sports meeting and was said to be \"the most successful athlete at the gathering\". He won the ‘sheaf tossing’ event in a field of nineteen, was second in the Returned Soldiers’ 100 yard race, second also in the ‘stepping the chain’ event, and first in the Returned Soldiers’ Maori only race.\nHe began the 1920 season playing in the Te Puke club competition for Rangataua in a match with Maketu on 8 May. His appearances for them appear limited to the start of the season as the majority of his season was spent playing representative rugby for Te Puke and Bay of Plenty. He played for Rangataua against the Te Puke club side on 29 May and was then selected to play for the Te Puke sub-union team against Tauranga on 12 June. Gardiner shone for Te Puke in the ‘rover’ position, and scored all of their points in a 13–12 win with 2 tries, 2 conversions, and a penalty. It was said in the Bay of Plenty Times that he was \"one of the greatest forwards in the Dominion\".\nHe captained the Bay of Plenty side for their match against Poverty Bay at Whakatane on 18 June. They won 8 to 0 in torrential rain. They then played a trial match with Rotorua and won 9–6 with Gardiner kicking 2 penalties. The purpose of the match was to prepare for their southern tour where they would play Wellington for the Ranfurly Shield followed by a match with Wanganui. The match with Wellington resulted in a 23 to 3 loss on Athletic Park in Wellington. The match against Wanganui on 3 July at the recreation ground there saw a 0–0 draw.\nGardiner's next match was for Te Puke against the Grafton club side from Auckland. The match saw another draw, this time 3-3. He played for Bay of Plenty against Auckland on 31 July with the Bay side winning 17-10 and Gardiner scoring a try at the Tauranga Domain in front of a crowd of 2,000. His try came about after he \"secured the ball forty yards out and running at top speed outpaced the Auckland backs and scored the best try of the day, grounding between the posts\". A match for Te Puke against Tauranga followed on 14 August which was lost 6–9. Sometime soon after this Gardiner's business interests changed with his business in Te Puke with Mr W. Davis moving solely into Davis’ hands. Gardiner then moved back to the Tauranga area as on 22 October he turned out for Tauranga in their match with Te Puna in the Jordan Cup final. He scored a try, and kicked a penalty and a goal from a mark to score all 9 of their points in a 9–17 loss. He then finished his season with another match for Tauranga against Whakatāne on 29 October which was also lost 6–9.\nDisqualification and boxing.\nControversy marred the beginning of the 1921 season for Gardiner as he had played for Tauranga while under suspension by the Te Puke Union and without a clearance to play for Tauranga at the end of the previous season. Te Puke had disqualified him from playing for 12 months but Tauranga had asked for full evidence. Te Puke then wrote a letter requesting that his disqualification be lifted.\nOn 28 June it was reported that a boxing school was being started in Te Puke with Gardiner one of those who would be joining it. He was already being coached by Mr W.A. Voice and Mr B. Treweek who were to be the schools coaches. On 11 July he fought A. James in Auckland as part of the Auckland provincial amateur boxing championships at the Auckland Town Hall. Gardiner was weighed in at 13st 2lb while his opponent was 11st 9lb. Gardiner lost the fight after going down for a six count after taking a right punch, while earlier in the fight he had fallen through the ropes after backing away from James’ punches.\nReturn to rugby field with Rovers (Te Puke).\nGardiner began the year competing at an athletics meeting at Matatā. He won the hop, step, and jump event, and placed first in the 100 yards handicap. He also won the ‘maiden race’ but was disqualified having previously won a race.\nGardiner had begun playing rugby again but was once again playing for a new team. He was named to captain the Rovers side in Te Puke in their match against Tauranga Football Club on 22 April. He was well involved in an 8–3 win. He played further matches for them against Rangiuru, Railway, and United where he scored 2 tries in a 28–5 win. This was to be his last ever official rugby union game.\nRugby league playing career.\nNew Zealand Māori tour.\nIn April Jim Rukutai had sent George Iles, based in Tauranga a letter telling him that he wished to establish the league code in the area. He said that he had heard a lot about Gardiner (amongst others) and was organising a team of Māori footballers to go to Australia later in the year. Gardiner was indeed selected and agreed to go on the tour as vice-captain. They had assembled in Auckland in late May and he was joined by his Rovers teammate Fred Harawira.\nTheir first match was against Auckland at Carlaw Park on 20 May prior to their departure and saw New Zealand Māori win 28 to 16. After arriving in Australia they played a very powerful Sydney Metropolis side and were thrashed 12–77 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of an enormous crowd of 35,000. Gardiner played in the loose forward position and kicked 2 conversions. He then played lock in a 32–14 loss to New South Wales 2nd XIII. He kicked 2 conversions and a penalty before 30,000 spectators once again at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Gardiner than played in the centres in an upset 23–22 win over Queensland in Brisbane on 10 June. The Māori side trailed by 22 to 5 before a huge late surge saw them score 4 tries to take the match. Three days later he played centre again against Toowoomba, this time they went down 26-6 before 2,000 spectators. Further losses followed to Ipswich (3-20), and then Queensland (19-31). Gardiner had been moved to the wing and he scored 2 tries there against Queensland in their narrow loss. Gardiner then played in match 8 of the tour against Stanthorpe which they won 6–3, and Orange on 28 June which they also won by 25 points to 15 with Gardiner scoring 3 tries. This was the final match of the tour. Overall the tour was regarded as somewhat of a failure, especially compared to previous New Zealand Māori rugby league tours. As a result, the crowds dwindled and financially the tour lost money.\nApplication for reinstatement and Bay of Plenty rugby league.\nA month after the last match was played Gardiner applied for reinstatement to rugby. Rugby league was not played in the Bay of Plenty at this time which is where he had returned to. However, the Rotorua Rugby Union declined the application.\nFortunately for Gardiner moves were underway in the Bay of Plenty to establish the league game there thanks largely to the efforts of former New Zealand player George Iles. Gardiner was selected to play for Tauranga against Rotorua on 16 September. The match was the first rugby league game ever played in Tauranga and saw the visiting side win 29–28 with Gardiner scoring a try under the posts after a breakaway.\nHe was then picked to play for the Bay of Plenty side against a very powerful New South Wales touring side. The match was played at Arawa Park before 2,000 spectators in Rotorua, and Gardiner scored Bay of Plenty's only try in a 29–5 loss. His try was from 30 metres out beating the opposition fullback along the way. His next league match was for Te Puke (their first ever league side), though this time he was playing against Tauranga. Te Puke won by 26 points to 20 in Te Puke. Gardiners final game of the season came in another appearance for Bay of Plenty against the touring Auckland team. The Auckland team won 33–26 on the Tauranga Domain with Gardiner scoring a try, and kicking 2 conversions and a penalty.\nMarist Old Boys and Auckland debut.\nUnfortunately for Gardiner the league game did not become established in the Bay of Plenty area and the 1923 season saw him playing no football whatsoever. He applied for reinstatement to rugby union again in May 1924 but was turned down once more, though this time by the New Zealand Rugby Union. Gardiner then moved to Auckland and was named to play in the Athletic side for a 24 May game in the Auckland rugby league competition however the match was postponed. There was then mention of him possibly being included in the pack for the Marist Old Boys side against Richmond Rovers, and he did indeed make his debut in this match on 31 May. He was extremely impressive in his early matches for Marist scoring a remarkable 61 points in his first 7 matches. He was picked during this period for Auckland where he played in the second row against the touring England side. Auckland lost 24–11 in front of an enormous crowd of 20,000 at Carlaw Park. Gardiner finished the season scoring 71 points which was the second highest of any player. Marist won the 1924 senior competition defeating Devonport United in the final.\nTransfer to Ponsonby United.\nThe 1925 season was an extremely busy one for Gardiner. He was having financial issues, declaring bankruptcy and blaming Marist for not meeting promises they made that led to him coming to Auckland. Gardiner had three children by this point and the Auckland Star detailed his statement to the office of the Official Signee on 17 March. There was then talk of him moving to the Ponsonby United club prior to the season starting. A transfer was then put in but not initially granted before it was eventually approved on 13 May, although it was erroneously reported as a transfer to Devonport United in the newspaper.\nThere he played 14 games including the finals of both the Roope Rooster and Stormont Shield with both matches resulting in wins. In an 8 August match against Athletic, Gardiner scored 3 tries and kicked 7 conversions for 23 individual points which was a record individual points haul in Auckland club league to this point.\nDuring the season he also made 3 appearances for Auckland against New Zealand, South Auckland, and then New Zealand again, where he scored 3 tries and kicked 1 conversion in total. He then played for the Auckland Provincial team against the touring Queensland side on 10 October.\nNew Zealand debut.\nThe 1926 season saw Gardiner selected for the New Zealand team to tour England and Wales. He played 7 matches for Ponsonby and was then picked to play for an ‘A Team’ as part of a series of New Zealand trial matches. He kicked 6 conversions in a 30–28 win for his side, and then came on as an injury replacement for the New Zealand Possible side who played immediately afterwards.\nGardiner was then named in the New Zealand side and prior to their departure he made his debut for New Zealand against Auckland. New Zealand did not take the match seriously and lost 52–32 with Gardiner kicking 3 conversions.\nNew Zealand tour of England and Wales.\nOn 3 August the New Zealand team departed on board the Aorangi. They travelled to Suva, Fiji where an exhibition match was played before moving on to Hawaii. During that part of the voyage three of the Māori players on tour (Gardiner, Lou Brown, and Craddock Dufty) dressed in traditional Māori costume for a fancy dress ball onboard and were the \"hit of the evening. Their effort evoked one continuous roar of laughter from the passengers\". When in Hawaii the team held canoe races with a crew led by Gardiner comprising himself, Stan Webb, Frank Delgrosso, Alphonsus Carroll winning.\nAfter arriving in England, he played in the first tour match on 11 September against Dewsbury which New Zealand won 13–9 with Gardiner's play described as being \"excellent\". A crowd of 16,000 had been on hand to watch the match at Dewsbury's Crown Flatt stadium ground with Gardiner leading the haka. Gardiner who was playing on the wing was said to have \"proved a strong-running wing and handled and kicked well all day\". At one point he made a good run and crossed the try line but could not pull up fast enough before crossing the dead ball line in the very short in goal areas. Gardiner then played in New Zealand's 23–16 win over Leigh on 15 September. He was once again on the wing and scored two tries after finishing off \"excellent pieces of concerted play\". The first came after Ben Davidson put in a strong run before sending on a pass to Gardiner who went over in the corner. The second came after Gardiner made a strong fending run down the touch line and eventually received the ball back from Davidson to score again. Three days later Gardiner again found himself on the win for their match against Halifax. However, this time New Zealand lost, by the score of 19–13.\nGardiner wouldn't play again until 6 October when he scored 12 of New Zealand's 19 points in a 19–11 win over York. He scored a try, kicked 3 conversions, and 2 penalties. His try was the final one for New Zealand and his goal kicking was a flawless 5 from 5. His try was described as \"the finest try [to that point] on the tour, and [his was] admitted by Yorkites to be the best individual wing effort they had seen on their ground\". He received the ball \"on the touch line at halfway, raced down at top speed, brushing all opposition and scoring a magnificent try\". Gardiner led the haka before their match with Warrington on 9 October but New Zealand played poorly and went down 17–5 with Gardiner converting New Zealand's only try by Len Mason. He again kicked a solitary conversion in New Zealand's easy win over Bramley on 13 October. They won 35–12 in front of 2,000 spectators.\nAround this point of the tour it became marred by several players, predominantly forwards going on strike. They refused to play under the coaching and managing of Ernest Mair due to his selections, coaching methods and other financial and management issues from very early in the tour. As a result, several backs had to move into the forwards and Gardiner was one of these partly due to his size. He was alongside Ernie Herring and Bert Avery in a \"meritorious\" win over Hull on 13 October by 15 points to 13 with a last minute conversion winning the match. Hull had not lost at home for 25 matches. He was again in the forwards for the match with Oldham on 23 October which was lost 15–10. It was commented on in the New Zealand Herald the strangeness with the selections with Gardiner and now Dufty being picked in the forwards ahead of other forwards who were not playing. The news of the fall out between some players and management had not reached the New Zealand shores. Gardiner played in the second row for the next three matches against Leeds (27 October), St Helens (30 October), and Salford (3 November). Leeds were defeated 13–11 with Gardiner involved in some passing which led to a try to Ben Davidson. New Zealand then lost to St Helens 28 to 14. Gardiner scored a try in the win over Salford by 18 points to 10. He played despite \"still suffering\" from influenza but was rested after this to help him recover more fully. In December a letter was received in Auckland by an Auckland member of the touring side complaining about selections and he specifically mentioned how Gardiner \"has been up in the forwards, and has proved the right man in the right place for the ‘mixed stuff’ that has to be faced in some of these game\".\nGardiner's next game was against Wigan Highfield on 17 November where he found himself back on the wing with many of the striking forwards now back playing. He scored two tries in a 14–2 win. His first try came after a scrum where the ball reached him via Jack Kirwan and he scored in the corner after \"using his weight to his advantage\". His second came after he fell on a kick in the in goal from Wally Desmond. On 20 November Gardiner was part of the side defeated by Batley 19–17. He set up a try in \"atrocious\" conditions due to \"heavy rain and a wet ground\" scored by Frank Henry. He then scored an unconverted try which had given New Zealand a 15–14 lead at the halftime break.\nThe match against St Helens saw Gardiner involved in a remarkable incident. New Zealand lost 22–12 with Gardiner scoring a try. However, the match was marked by the sending off of Gardiner after he struck the touch judge near the end of the match. Gardiner admitted striking the blow and said it was due to the touch judge using an insulting expression with the touch judge refusing to make a statement. When interviewed later Gardiner said \"the touch judge signalled a try when Ellaby crossed. I disagreed and said so. The judge said: Keep your eyes open, you dirty dago’. I lost my temper and struck him\". The Daily Mail then reported that Gardiner \"was disinclined to leave the field, but eventually he and the referee went off arm in arm amid cheers\". Gardiner played 3 days later on 11 December against Wigan with New Zealand losing heavily by 36 points to 15 in front of 8,000 spectators. Four days later a hearing was held into Gardiner's earlier sending off and he was suspended by the English Rugby League for three matches.\nAfter his suspension ended Gardiner again appeared on the wing for New Zealand in a 32–8 win over Broughton Rangers on 27 December. This was followed by a 29–24 win over Wakefield Trinity on just a day later on 28 December before a crowd of 7,000. Gardiner scored a try in a team performance described as the \"best display of attacking seen in Wakefield for a long time\". This was followed on New Years Day with a 20–15 loss to Hull Kingston Rovers before 8,000 spectators with Gardiner again on the wing. Gardiner's penultimate match of the tour was against Cumberland and saw New Zealand win 18–3. He scored a try and kicked 2 conversions and a penalty giving him a tour haul of 10 tries and 10 goals from what was to end up at 20 appearances. He had been moved back into the second row, because there had been more trouble between the same group of players and coach Mair. His final match of the tour was against England in the third and final test. New Zealand had lost the first two tests and they would again lose, going down 32–17 with Gardiner in the second row. It was played in wet weather with 8,000 in attendance in Leeds on 18 January.\nContinuation with Ponsonby.\nAfter returning to New Zealand the returning members of the side who were from Auckland played a match against an Auckland side. The match at Carlaw Park saw the returning NZ players go down 24–21 with Gardiner kicking a penalty before a crowd of 14,000. He then resumed his playing career at Ponsonby United and played 16 matches for them including in the championship final against Newton Rangers which they lost 6–3. He scored 6 tries and kicked 13 goals for 44 points total over that 1927 season which meant he was the third highest scorer. In 1928 he played 14 matches for Ponsonby, scoring 6 tries and kicking 3 goals. It was notable by this point that he was no longer being selected for representative football. In 1929 he played 16 matches for Ponsonby scoring 3 tries and kicking 5 goals. One of his tries came in the championship final when his Ponsonby side defeated Devonport United by 5 points to 0 before a crowd of 11,000. He also played in the side which lost the Roope Rooster final to Marist Old Boys 17-9 and the side which lost to Marist 28–14 in the Stormont Shield final. In October the South Sydney side toured New Zealand and Gardiner taught them a haka whilst on a picnic with the team which was said to mean they were \"the first Sydney team to possess a Māori war cry\".\nThe 1930 season was to be Gardiner's last full season for Ponsonby but it was one of his more successful ones with them. He played 15 matches and scored 2 tries and kicked 3 goals. He was part of the team which comfortably won the championship and then defeated Richmond Rovers 15–7 to win the Roope Rooster with Gardiner scoring a try. They then went down to Devonport United 17–5 in the final of the Stormont Shield. Their final match of the season was in a provincial ‘club championship’ match with the winners of the South Auckland competition, Ngaruawahia with Ponsonby winning 32-29 and Gardiner scoring a try. In 1931 Gardiner just played 2 matches for Ponsonby after there had earlier been doubts that he would play at all. Then on 15 July he turned out for the Waterside Workers team in the midweek competition which was played between various business league teams. He ultimately played for them at least six times and scored 2 tries and kicked 5 goals including 1 in their final win over Stonex and Stormont. He was then drawn back into the Ponsonby side to play their Roope Rooster semi-final with Richmond Rovers which saw them win 28-20 after extra-time. Followed by the final where he scored a try in a 34–17 loss. His final ever appearances for Ponsonby came at the end of the 1932 when he was pulled into the side again for their Roope Rooster round 1 match with Newton Rangers which they won 36 to 10 with Gardiner scoring 2 tries. He then travelled to New Plymouth to play Devonport United in an exhibition match at Pukekura Park. The match was drawn 28–28 with Gardiner scoring a try in what was to be the final ever official football match of his career.\nProfessional wrestling career.\nNew Zealand matches.\nIn 1931 Gardiner had begun professional wrestling. On 14 July he wrestled E.A. Brown, the amateur heavyweight of Wellington in a three-minute round fight which resulted in a draw at the Auckland Town Hall. Gardiner was said to weigh 15 stone. In August 1932 he wrestled Limutkin a Russian wrestler, and Ike Robin. He was defeated in both bouts but \"was responsible for a very creditable display\".\nMove to Australia to wrestle.\nIn 1933 Gardiner had moved to Australia to embark on a more serious professional wrestling career. By this stage he was around 35 years of age. He was wrestling under the name of “George Tiki” or “Hori Tiki”. In a February 27 bout with Tom Lurich of Poland he lost by two falls to one in five rounds of wrestling at Leichhardt Stadium. Then in June he lost to fellow New Zealander Charlie Pollard. In July he fought “Nugget” Potaka in Queensland and it was described as featuring “such and amount of horseplay, frivolity and synthetic roughness that the police stopped the bout”. Then on October 3 he wrestled George Pencheff of Bulgaria in Perth and lost by two falls to one. Pencheff weighed in at 97.5 kilograms while “Tiki” was 93.4 kilograms. Then he fought Leon Labriola in Perth on November 26 in an “all-in wrestling match at the stadium after the latter had refused to shake hands. Tiki then attacked Labriola with his bare fists, but the fight was stopped by the police”. His next fight was against Ali Bey in Perth and he lost failing “to break his very persistent run of bad luck”. In July he wrestled the Chinese-American fighter Wong Buck Cheong who weighed in at 14st 3lb. Near the end of the fight Tiki stopped wrestling and was merely warding off Cheong. It was later discovered that he had broken a rib. He did however win the fight after both wrestlers had earlier won a fall but Tiki was the stronger overall. He fought Billy Meeske in September at Fitzroy Stadium and by this time his weight had increased significantly to 102.5 kilograms. They battled to a draw in a match described as a “wild ten-round contest and resulted in a draw after the Māori had exercised his right to demand two extra rounds, each man securing a fall”. The match was unpopular with Sydney patrons with “the throwing of pennies into the ring”. In March 1939 he fought Fred Atkins at Leichhardt Stadium and lost after crashing through the ropes in the fifth round. He hit his head on the press benches and was injured badly enough where he was unable to continue fighting. Then in late June he fought King (Kingsley) Elliot of Auckland (though he had been living in the USA) in an exhibition described as “fast, open, and scientific” at the City Hall in Hobart. Tiki won the eight round fight after forcing Elliot to submit with a “crucifix” hold in the seventh round before the judges awarded him the fight at its conclusion.\nWorld War II and death.\nFollowing the outbreak of World War II, Gardiner, now aged over 40, enlisted in the Australian Forces. He was part of the Australian 2/23rd Battalion. He left Australia for the Middle East in November 1940. In early 1941 a German advance in Libya pushed British and Commonwealth forces back towards the Egyptian border. In early May the Germans captured part of Tobruk’s outer area and this area became known as the Salient. In “the early hours of 17 May the 2/23rd Battalion participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture the lost ground”. They made some gains but ultimately most of the Australian attacking forces were forced back and they suffered heavy casualties. After the operation there were 95 Australians reported missing including Gardiner amongst six other officers. There were conflicting reports of what had happened to him including him being taken to a hospital in Egypt, or that he had been captured. It was later determined after an inquiry that he had been shot “through the abdomen and died of his wounds the day after the battle”. His death occurred in fighting at Cyrenaica near Tobruk with the cause of death recorded as peritonitis. George Gardiner was buried in the Knightsbridge War Cemetery in Acroma, west of Tobruk in Libya.\nOn May 13, 1942 the Bay of Plenty Times published an obituary for George Gardiner. On 10 April 2016 the Australian War Memorial held a ceremony to commemorate Lieutenant George Gardiner's life and service. Gardiner was survived by his wife Mary Gardiner and a son, Parata Ngatai Gardiner."

        "text": "Hunter Noah Brown (born August 29, 1998) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played college baseball at Wayne State University. The Astros selected him in the fifth round of the 2019 MLB draft, and he made his MLB debut in 2022.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Detroit, Michigan, Hunter Brown grew up in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. He attended St. Isaac Jogues elementary school, followed by Lakeview High School, where he played catcher and pitcher.\nBrown played college baseball at NCAA Division II Wayne State University, located one mile from Comerica Park, and the only school at any level to offer him a scholarship. In 2018, he played in two collegiate summer baseball leagues. He played for the Bethesda Big Train of the Cal Ripken Collegiate Baseball League, where he appeared in 13 games and pitched to an ERA of 1.26. After his season with the Big Train, Brown played with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. As a junior at Wayne State, Brown went 9–0 with a 2.21 earned run average over 14 starts and struck out 114 batters in innings pitched.\nWhile Justin Verlander was pitching for the Detroit Tigers, Brown grew up idolizing him and frequently attended games at Comerica Park. Late in the 2022 season, Verlander, then pitching for the Houston Astros, landed on the injured list due to a right calf issue, and Astros called Brown up to the major leagues. The two pitchers became teammates.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nBrown was selected in the 5th round of the 2019 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft by the Houston Astros. He signed with the team and was assigned to the Tri-City ValleyCats of the Class A Short Season New York–Penn League and went 2–2 with a 4.56 ERA and 33 strikeouts in innings pitched.\nAfter not playing in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Brown began the 2021 season with the Double-A Corpus Christi Hooks. Brown was promoted to the Triple-A Sugar Land Skeeters in August 2021 after posting a 1–4 record with a 4.20 ERA and 76 strikeouts in innings pitched with the Hooks.\nThe Astros invited Brown to 2022 Spring Training camp as a non-roster invitee. He returned to Sugar Land to start the season, and was selected to the All-Star Futures Game. On May 31, he was named Pacific Coast League (PCL) Pitcher of the Week after a scoreless 7-inning outing with 10 strikeouts versus the El Paso Chihuahuas. Brown finished his season in Triple A as the PCL leader in ERA (2.55, minimum 60 innings pitched), and induced a strikeout rate of 31.5% and groundball rate of 54.2%. Over 23 total appearances, he made 14 starts and hurled 106 innings. In August 2022, Brown ranked as the Astros' top prospect and moved in MLB.com Pipeline's from #80 to #71 overall in baseball. His curveball (65) was graded as the best among all top-100 prospects. Following the regular season, he was named PCL Pitcher of the Year, and the Houston Astros' Minor League Pitcher of the Year.\nHouston Astros.\nThe Astros promoted Brown from Sugar Land to the major league roster for the first time on September 1, 2022. On September 5, he started and won a sensational major league debut, hurling the first six innings of a 1–0 shutout of the Texas Rangers. He allowed three hits, one walk and struck out five to outduel Rangers ace Martín Pérez. Brown retired the first eight batters faced, including striking out the first two of the game, Marcus Semien and Corey Seager, for his first two career strikeouts. The win evened the Astros' all-time franchise win-loss record at 4,812–4,812, for the first time since in May 14, 2006. In his second start of the season, Brown made his road debut as a homecoming in Detroit with friends and family in attendance, leading a 6–3 defeat of the Tigers. He allowed two runs on five hits over six innings. On September 19, Brown made his relief debut, hurling three innings in a 4–0 shutout of the Tampa Bay Rays to clinch a fifth American League West division title for the Astros over the previous six seasons. On October 4, Brown relieved Verlander in an ongoing no-hitter versus the Philadelphia Phillies and delivered hitless innings that Houston pitching maintained until the ninth inning. \nIn 2022, Brown was 2–0 with an 0.89 ERA in innings with 22 strikeouts, in seven games (two starts).\nBrown made his postseason debut on October 11, 2022, in Game 1 of the American League Division Series. He pitched in relief in the eighth inning, surrendering just one hit in an 8–7 Astros' walk-off win over the Seattle Mariners. Brown also threw two scoreless innings in the 12th and 13th of the Astros' 18-inning victory over the Mariners in Game 3. Brown's last appearance of the postseason came in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees, throwing of an inning to help close out a 5–0 win. The Astros advanced to the World Series and defeated the Phillies in six games to give him his first career World Series title."

        "text": "Willoughby Waterleys Cricket Club is an amateur cricket club that up until recently was based at Dunton Bassett Cricket Club, Dunton Bassett, Leicestershire.\nGround.\nWilloughby Waterleys CC home ground was on Dunton Bassett Cricket Club, Lutterworth Road, due east of Dunton Bassett village from the early 1990s to 2015.\nHistory.\nCricket in Willoughby Waterleys (formerly known as Willoughby Waterless) dates back to at least the late 19th century. When \"Willoughby Waterless Cricket Club\" took part in the Lutterworth &amp; District Village Cricket Challenge Cup, between 1922 and 1939 they won the Challenge Cup 5 times. However, after the Second World War, the club focused on friendly matches and at some point ceased activity, until the Queen's Silver Jubilee year of 1977 when the club was reformed using the modern spelling of Willoughby Waterleys, in response to a challenge to a match from the neighbouring village of Ashby Magna. \nAfter a brief spell on a field off Ashby Lane, the new club's ground was based on land next to West End Farm, Gilmorton Lane. When the owner of the farm moved to Nickle's Farm, the club followed. By 1990, the Club moved away from the field and rented space at the Dunton Bassett Cricket Club ground; and continued to play successful cricket as a friendly XI side. However, in 2015, the club struggled to sustain enough players to form a team and as a result decided to suspend activity.\nClub performance.\nThe nearest Sunday leagues in Leicestershire were too far away for the Club to travel (\"Grantham and Melton Cricket Association\" and the \"Rutland and District Cricket League\") and like so many other clubs in the region, they had to make their own arrangements. This allowed a level of freedom for the team to explore a wider choice of clubs and grounds in and around South Leicestershire, and there were frequent matches with neighbouring teams: Arnesby, Fleckney Village, Gumley, Harborough South, Laughton and Mowsley, Wigston Town, etc. They also organised annual tours the length and breadth of Great Britain (e.g. Bristol - Bishopston North Wales - Maeshafn etc.)\nEvidence shows that the standard of play proved to be very high (See fixture and results table for 2014 below)."

After a year with the freshman team, Jagger joined the varsity club in 1968 and helped the team to a 22-win season. Jagger led the team's defense with 39 points and was a rising star for the Badgers as the team transitioned into the WCHA. In the team's first season of conference play, Jagger's point total dropped significantly, declining to just 16, but he was instrumental in leading Wisconsin to a 4th-place finish in the conference and was named as the program's first All-American in 1970. That same year Wisconsin shocked college hockey by defeating two-time defending national champion Denver in the conference tournament and earned the Badgers' first bid to the NCAA Tournament. Wisconsin nearly pulled off a second upset when they led undefeated Cornell at the start of the third period but a pair of goals allowed the Big Red to escape.\nAs a senior, Jagger's scoring returned to the level he achieved as a sophomore and Wisconsin rose to third in the conference, however, the Badgers lost in the first round of the conference tournament and Jagger's college career was over. After graduating Jagger played two seasons of professional and senior hockey before retiring."

The Tigers represent Princeton University in the NCAA's Ivy League.\nPrinceton began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1900. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Princeton's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2019–20 season."

The team moniker was noted to be the \"Mollycoddlers,\" as Tonopah played the 1907 season as members of the Independent level Nevada State League. The 1907 Tonopah team was the only minor league team hosted in Tonopah, Nevada.\nTonopah also was home to the 1907 Tonopah Pullmans, possibly a negro leagues semi–pro team.\nHistory.\nIn 1907, Tonopah was a charter member of the Nevada State League, which began minor league play in the 1907 season, operating as an Independent four–team league. The Nevada State League was formed under the direction of league president John T. Powers, who later was the first president of the Federal League. The 1907 Nevada State League was formed with the charter franchises based in Carson City, Nevada, Goldfield, Nevada, Reno, Nevada and Tonopah, Nevada.\nThe 1907 Nevada State League was established with Powers serving as league president and Bert Ulmer serving as the league treasurer. On July 6, 1907 a league meeting was held. The meeting was hosted at the office of Senator James Boyd in Carson City and the Nevada State League Board of Directors was formed during this meeting. The directors chosen that day were Ben Rosenthal of Goldfield, Senator James T. Boyd of Reno, J.P Merder of Carson City and Thomas Kendall of Tonopah. Powers had previously served as president of the Wisconsin State League. Ulmer was an owner of the Elite Saloon in Goldfield. James T. Boyd was a member of the Nevada State Senate from 1906 to 1910. Rosenthal was Goldfield County commissioner. Kendall was a mining pioneer, owner of the Kendall Mine and a founder of Toonpah.\nReferences indicate the Tonopah team was known as the Tonopah \"Mollycoddlers\". The other league members were noted to have been called the Carson City \"Capitals\" Goldfield \"Miners\" and Reno \"Mudhens,\" Unofficial records place the Tonopah team in third place, behind the 1st place Goldfield \"Miners,\" who had a 9–5 record and Carson City with a 7–4–1 record. They were followed by the Tonopah \"Mollycoddlers\" with a 3–6 record and the Reno \"Mudhens\" with a 3–7–1 record. It is noted that the Reno team disbanded on July 15, 1907. It is likely the rest of the league, Tonopah included, followed suit in folding, as only three teams would have remained. Tonopah did not host another minor league team.\nThere are photographs of a second Tonopah 1907 team called the Tonopah Pullmans. The Pullmans were possibly a negro leagues barnstorming or semi–pro team. It is noted that this team consisted of railroad workers who had formed their own Fraternal Lodge in Tonopah. The Pullmans' listed roster from September 27, 1907 included Buck, Underwood, Powell, Morris, Taylor, Lindsey, Clarence Townsend, Charles Townsend, Hall, Troutman and Curby.\nThe ballpark.\nThe exact name and location of the 1907 Tonopah ballpark is unknown.\nNotable alumni.\nNo roster information for the 1907 Tonopah minor league team is known."

For the 2021 season, Davis hit .370/.482/.663 with 15 home runs and 48 RBI while registering 31 walks and 24 strikeouts over fifty games. In college, he exclusively played catcher on defense. He was named to the All-Atlantic Coast Conference First-Team and also garnered All-American honors.\nProfessional career.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates selected Davis with the first overall selection of the 2021 Major League Baseball draft. On July 18, 2021, Davis signed with Pittsburgh for a $6.5 million signing bonus. Davis made his professional debut with the Rookie-level Florida Complex League Pirates on August 3, homering in his third at-bat of the game. After two games, he was promoted to the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the High-A East. After six games with Greensboro, he was placed on the injured list with an oblique injury and missed the remainder of the season. Over eight games for the 2021 season, Davis batted .308 in 26 at-bats with three home runs and seven RBIs, while playing catcher.\nDavis returned to Greensboro to open the 2022 season. After batting .342/.450/.585 with five home runs and 22 RBI over 22 games with Greensboro, he was promoted to the Altoona Curve of the Double-A Eastern League in early May. After two games with the Curve, he was placed on the injured list with a wrist injury. He returned to play in mid-June. He was selected to represent the Pirates alongside Mike Burrows at the 2022 All-Star Futures Game. In early July, he was placed back on the injured list with an injury to the same wrist. Over 59 games for the season, Davis batted .264/.380/.472 with ten home runs and 42 RBI, almost exclusively playing catcher. He was selected to play in the Arizona Fall League for the Surprise Saguaros after the season, and in 50 at bats hit .260/.435/.440. \nTo open the 2023 season, Davis returned to Altoona. After hitting .284/.433/.541 with 10 home runs in 41 games, Davis was promoted to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians on June 4, 2023. On June 18, after 10 games in Indianapolis in which he batted .286/.432/.514, the Pirates announced that Davis would be promoted to the major leagues for the first time the following day. He was formally selected to the 40-man roster the following day. He was subsequently slotted into the lineup batting seventh as the starting right fielder in the team's game against the Chicago Cubs. On his first at-bat of the game and in his major league career, he hit a double. On July 21, Davis hit two home runs off of Los Angeles Angels starter Shohei Ohtani. In doing so, he became the first player to hit two home runs off of Ohtani in the same game in Ohtani's career."

The original schedule had called for eight downhills, but (as discussed below) the World Cup finals race was canceled. \n2018 discipline champion Sofia Goggia of Italy, who had struggled with injuries since then, held the lead through midseason, and after the second downhill at Crans Montana, she had opened up a 195-point lead over Breezy Johnson of the United States, with everyone else over 200 points behind. However, he then broke a bone in her knee on 31 January and missed the next two events, providing two Swiss skiers (defending discipline champion Corinne Suter of Switzerland and 2016 overall champion Lara Gut-Behrami) with the opportunity to pass her at the season final with a great finish.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2021 World Ski Championships, which were held from 8–21 February in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. The women's downhill took place on 13 February 2021.\nThe final was scheduled for Wednesday, 17 March in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. Tentatively, Goggia had planned to try to return for the finals, although her broken bone was still mending. However, three straight days of heavy snowfall, which prevented even a training run from being held, caused the downhill finals to be cancelled, and so Goggia won her second downhill crystal globe without needing to return (her first was in 2018)."

A total of 32 teams competed in the group stage to decide the 16 places in the knockout phase of the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League.\nSheriff Tiraspol made their debut appearance in the group stage, becoming the first team from Moldova to play in the Champions League group stage.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 26 August 2021, 18:00 CEST (19:00 TRT), in Istanbul, Turkey. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots, each of eight teams, based on the following principles:\nTeams from the same association, and due to political reasons, teams from Ukraine and Russia, cannot be drawn into the same group. Prior to the draw, UEFA formed pairings of teams from the same association (one pairing for associations with two or three teams, two pairings for associations with four or five teams) based on television audiences, where one team was drawn into Groups A–D and another team was drawn into Groups E–H, so that the two teams would play on different days. The following pairings were announced by UEFA after the group stage teams were confirmed:\nOn each matchday, one set of four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other set of four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups alternating between each matchday. The fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public. Each team would not play more than two home matches or two away matches in a row, and would play one home match and one away match on the first and last matchdays (Regulations Article 16.02). This arrangement was different from previous seasons, where the same two teams would play at home on the first and last matchdays.\nTeams.\nBelow were the participating teams (with their 2021 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot. They included:\nNotes\nFormat.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The top two teams of each group advanced to the round of 16. The third-placed teams were transferred to the Europa League knockout round play-offs, while the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from European competitions for the season.\nTiebreakers.\nTeams were ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams were tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings (see Article 17 Equality of points – group stage, Regulations of the UEFA Champions League):\nDue to the abolition of the away goals rule, head-to-head away goals were no longer applied as a tiebreaker starting from this season. However, total away goals were still applied as a tiebreaker.\nGroups.\nThe fixtures were announced on 27 August 2021, the day after the draw. The matches were played on 14–15 September 28–29, September 19–20, October 2–3, November 23–24, November, and 7–8 December 2021. The scheduled kick-off times were 18:45 (two matches on each day) and 21:00 (remaining six matches) CET/CEST.\nTimes were CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup G.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup H.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "title": "Luke Williams (baseball)",
        "text": "Lucas Daniel Williams (born August 9, 1996) is an American professional baseball utility player for the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB). The Philadelphia Phillies selected Williams in the third round of the 2015 Major League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut in 2021 with the Phillies and has also played for the San Francisco Giants, Miami Marlins, and Los Angeles Dodgers. He has played every position other than catcher in both the minor leagues and the major leagues.\nEarly life.\nWilliams was born in Park Ridge, Illinois, and grew up in Orange County, California. He attended Dana Hills High School (2015), where he played baseball and football (as a starting wide receiver and defensive back) and was a sprinter on the track team, competing in the 100-meter dash and the 4 × 100 meters relay. \nPlaying for the high school baseball team, Williams set Dana Hills' school record for stolen bases in his junior season with 26 in 27 attempts; he matched that mark in his senior year as well. As a sophomore and junior, he played catcher. As a senior, he was team captain and batted .315/.454/.521 and scored 35 runs with 19 RBIs, 26 stolen bases, and four home runs while batting leadoff for much of the season, and had a .975 fielding percentage playing shortstop; he also caught and pitched for the team. He was named 2015 Cal-Hi Sports Second Team All-State. Prior to being drafted, Williams had committed to play college baseball at California Polytechnic over offers from UCLA and California, Irvine.\nProfessional career.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nThe Philadelphia Phillies selected Williams in the third round of the 2015 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the team for a $719,800 signing bonus.\nHe was assigned to the Gulf Coast League Phillies, where he played third base and batted .288/.400/.331 with 9 steals while being caught twice in 118 at bats. Williams spent the 2016 season with the Low-A Williamsport Crosscutters, playing third base and slashing .220/.297/.301 with 2 home runs, 11 steals (while being caught twice), and 18 RBIs in 186 at bats. \nIn 2017, he played for the Single-A Lakewood BlueClaws, playing third base and logging a .216/.269/.264 batting line with 41 runs and 29 stolen bases in 31 attempts in 402 at bats in 115 games. \nIn 2018, he played for the High-A Clearwater Threshers, batting .245/.319/.353 with career-highs in runs (51), home runs (9) and RBIs (43), with 14 steals in 21 attempts, in 388 at bats. He played first base, second base, third base, and every outfield position.\nWilliams spent the 2019 season with the Reading Fightin Phils of the AA Eastern League and batted .238/.319/.395 with 77 runs scored (2nd in the league), 30 doubles (2nd), 51 RBIs, 5 sacrifice flies (8th), and 44 extra base hits, along with 30 stolen bases (4th) while being caught 9 times, in 441 at bats. He played every position other than pitcher and catcher.\nWilliams was a non-roster invitee for the Phillies in spring training in 2020. Williams did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He played winter league for the Adelaide Giants of the Australian Baseball League, batting .292/.299/.361 in 72 at bats. He played every position other than pitcher and catcher. \nWilliams was named the best overall athlete in the Phillies' minor league system going into the 2021 season and was assigned to the Class AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs. With Lehigh Valley in 2021, he batted .245/.315/.316 in 98 at bats. He played every position other than pitcher and catcher.\nIn the minor leagues through 2021 he had played 303 games at third base, 55 games at second base, 47 games in left field, 38 games in right field, 18 games in center field, 16 games at first base, and 14 games at shortstop. He carries 8 gloves in his equipment bag.\nWilliams received his first major league call-up on June 8, 2021, to take the place of a struggling Nick Maton. He debuted with the Phillies that same day, filling in as a pinch hitter for starting pitcher Aaron Nola in the fifth inning of a game against the Atlanta Braves. In his first at-bat, Williams tripled on a bunt due to an Atlanta throwing error. He reached home in the next at-bat, an RBI double from Jean Segura. The following day, in his first MLB start, Williams hit a two-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning, lifting the Phillies to a 2–1 victory over the Braves. Williams remained in the Phillies lineup, sharing time in the outfield with Travis Jankowski. He saw the bulk of his playing time against left-handed pitchers, as well as filling in for an injured Andrew McCutchen. In 98 at bats for the season he hit .245/.315/.316. In the field, he played 15 games in center field, 8 at second base, 8 at third base, 7 in left field, 6 at first base, 5 at shortstop, 3 at third base, and 3 in right field. \nHe was designated for assignment on March 22, 2022.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn March 27, 2022, Williams was traded to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for infielder Will Toffey and cash. Williams was designated for assignment by the Giants after Michael Papierski was selected to the roster on May 21.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn May 26, 2022, Williams was traded to the Miami Marlins in exchange for infielder Hayden Cantrelle. Williams appeared in 71 games for the Marlins, slashing .235/.290/.313 with 1 home run, 3 RBI, and 11 stolen bases.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn November 8, 2022, Williams was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Dodgers. However, they non-tendered him on November 18, making him a free agent. On February 3, 2023, Williams re-signed with the Dodgers on a minor league contract. He was assigned to Triple-A Oklahoma City to begin the season and was called up to the majors on April 18. He had one hit in 10 at-bats with a stolen base in four games for the Dodgers, and hit .268 with six home runs, 29 RBI, and 11 stolen bases in 42 contests for Triple-A Oklahoma City.\nAtlanta Braves.\nOn June 5, 2023, Williams was claimed off waivers by the Atlanta Braves and subsequently assigned to the Gwinnett Stripers. In 7 games for Atlanta, he went 0–for–9 with 3 stolen bases. Williams was non-tendered and became a free agent on November 17. \nOn November 22, 2023, Williams re-signed with the Braves on a minor league contract. On April 19, his contract was selected.\nInternational career.\nIn May 2021, Williams was named to the roster of the United States national baseball team for the qualifying tournament for the 2020 Summer Olympics. He started all four of Team USA's games and led the team with a .444 batting average (8–18), six runs scored, and six RBIs.\nPlayer profile.\nWilliams is a utility player who enjoyed playing in a variety of positions, which has made him a useful bench player for the Phillies. He was inspired to take on a \"super-utility\" role after learning that Ben Zobrist spent 14 years in MLB while playing whatever position was asked of him. Williams' versatility on defense, as well as his speed, have also drawn praise from retired Los Angeles Angels manager Mike Scioscia, who wrote a scouting report that complimented Williams' ability to \"run and do a lot of different things\".\nPersonal life.\nWilliams has two brothers named Ike and Jake and a sister named Sami. Sami plays college softball for the Iowa State Cyclones, and in 2021, she became the first National Fastpitch Coaches Association All-American softball player in school history."

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2021 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), \"Sporting News\" (SN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2020–21 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose three teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2021 College Basketball All-American team will be determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by USA Today, Fox Sports, Yahoo! Sports and many others. The scholar-athletes selected by College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) are termed Academic All-Americans.\nIndividual All-America teams.\nBy team.\nAP Honorable Mention:\nAcademic All-Americans.\nThe College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) announced its 15-member 2021 Academic All-America team on May 28, 2021, divided into first, second and third teams, with Corey Kispert of Gonzaga chosen as men's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year.\nSenior All-Americans.\nThe 10 finalists for the Senior CLASS Award, called Senior All-Americans, were announced on February 22, 2021. Luka Garza of Iowa was named the recipient on April 2, with the first and second teams also being announced at that time."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Redhawks represent Southeast Missouri State University in the NCAA's Ohio Valley Conference.\nSoutheast Missouri State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1903. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Southeast Missouri State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Newspaper reports have been found recording cricket matches played by \"West Hallam Cricket Club\" in the grounds of the Squire Hall, off Cock Orchard in 1851. By 1871, the Hall was demolished and the club had to rent land from a local farmer, whose farm stood on the junction of The Village (street) and School Square. \"Hallam White Rose Cricket Club\" appeared on record in 1880. The addition of the 'White Rose' is said to be based on the white rose bushes in the gardens of the old Squire Hall. It is not known when the club moved to a recreation ground on Beech Lane, but after the Second World War, the Club played on a field off St. Wilfrid's Road until 1950, when they returned to what became Powtrell Community Pavilion Court on Beech Lane. The Club won the Butterley Cup in 1962, a couple of years before joining the Notts &amp; Derbyshire Border League in 1964 (which is now the Derbyshire County Cricket League); prior to this they mainly focused on playing friendly matches. By 2001, they became Division 1 League Champions and by 2007 they finally moved back to Cock Orchard off the Cat and Fiddle Lane, and officially opened their new home now known as The Statham Oval in 2011.\nThe Club currently have two senior teams competing in the Derbyshire County Cricket League, a junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Erewash Young Cricketers League and the Club are regulars in the Derbyshire Cricket Board Indoor Competition.\nClub performance.\nThe Derbyshire County Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 2001.\nThe Derbyshire Cricket Board Indoor Competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 2014."

        "text": "The 2007–08 Georgia Bulldogs basketball team represented the University of Georgia during the 2007–08 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team's head coach was Dennis Felton, who was in his fifth season at UGA. They played their home games at Stegeman Coliseum and were members of the Southeastern Conference. They finished the season 17–17, 4–12 in SEC play.\n2008 SEC Tournament: The Dream Dawgs.\nIn the 2007–2008 season, Georgia's men's basketball team came into the 2008 SEC men's basketball tournament with a 13–16 overall record and a 4–12 conference mark. At one point, the team sustained two five-game losing streaks during a 2-of-12 stretch in conference play. In the first round of the tournament, Georgia was slated to play Ole Miss, who had beaten the Bulldogs in the season-closer, securing the Rebels' only road SEC win of the season. The game went into overtime after Rebel David Huertas hit all three free throws after a three-point shooting foul, and looked to go into a second extra period after Chris Warren did the same. However, with 0.4 seconds left in overtime, Georgia senior Dave Bliss banked in the game-winner to shock the Rebels and send Georgia into a second-round matchup with Kentucky.\nOn the night of March 14, 2008, tornadoes hit Atlanta, in whose Georgia Dome the SEC Tournament was housed. The Georgia-Kentucky matchup was rescheduled for the early afternoon of March 15, 2008, with the winner advancing to play the SEC West's #1 seed, Mississippi State, later that evening. The remaining games in the tournament would be played at Alexander Memorial Coliseum, the basketball complex of Georgia Tech, UGA's in-state rival. Again playing an overtime game in which Georgia star Sundiata Gaines fouled out, Georgia freshman Zac Swansey hit a turnaround three-point jumper with 1.4 seconds left to give the Bulldogs the team's first ever win over Kentucky in the SEC Tournament. That night, Georgia defeated Mississippi State 64–60 to become the first team since Kentucky in 1952 to win two tournament games in one day, and the first-ever #6 seed from a division to advance to the modern (post-1992) SEC tournament finals.\nIn the finals, Georgia faced Arkansas, which had lost to Georgia 82–69 in the regular season. Georgia prevailed again, at one point leading the Razorbacks by nineteen points en route to winning its first tournament championship in 25 years. Sundiata Gaines and Terrance Woodbury were both named to the All-Tournament Team, with Gaines winning the tournament's MVP. The improbable list of achievements—winning the tournament as a 6-seed, playing two games in one day to reach the finals, playing two games (against Kentucky and Mississippi State) in which Gaines fouled out with a substantial amount of time to play, doing it on a rival's home court, and winning four consecutive elimination games following a season during which their longest winning streak stood at three—earned the 2007–2008 team the nickname of Dream Dawgs.\nWith the victory, Georgia secured itself an automatic bid in the 2008 NCAA tournament. Georgia's appearance in the tournament was the tenth overall in team history and the first since the 2002 NCAA basketball tournament. After their SEC Championship run, the Bulldogs were seeded 14th in the NCAA Tournament, playing against the #3 seeded Xavier Musketeers. After developing a lead early in the 2nd half, the Bulldogs could not hold on, as Xavier went on to win 73–61.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#000000; color:white;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#000000; color:white;\"| Non-conference games\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#000000; color:white;\"| Conference games\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#000000; color:white;\"| SEC tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#000000; color:white;\"| NCAA tournament"

It is also the first since 1992–93 to feature thirteen teams. The competition was broadcast by BT Sport for the ninth successive season with four league season games and the final also simulcast free-to-air on ITV. Highlights of each weekend's games were shown on ITV with extended highlights on BT Sport.\nThe reigning champions entering the season were Harlequins who claimed their 2nd title after defeating Exeter Chiefs in the 2021 final. Saracens were promoted as champions from the 2020–21 RFU Championship at the first attempt.\nDue to changes to the global rugby calendar implemented in 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic causing a moratorium to be placed on relegation last season, the tournament features thirteen teams and will include an extra four rounds. The season would take place over 40 weeks.\nRule changes.\nThis season sees the second year of a three-year moratorium on relegation from the league.\nSalary cap.\nThis season is the first under the reduced salary cap regulations before changes are made before 2024–25. A brief summary of the changes are:\nTeams.\nFor the first time since the 2002–03 Premiership Rugby season, all teams from the previous season will compete in the league together with Saracens who were promoted from the 2020–21 RFU Championship after an absence of one year, thus making a thirteen team league.\nRegular season.\nFixtures for the season were announced by Premiership Rugby on 13 July 2021. The league season begins on 17 September 2021 and is due to end on 18 June 2022. Each team receives two bye weeks. Highlights of the season include:\nAll fixtures are subject to change.\nRound 8.\n \nRound 9.\n \nRound 11.\n \nRound 14.\n \nRound 16.\n \nRound 23.\n \nRound 25.\n \nPlay-offs.\nAs in previous seasons, the top four teams in the Premiership table, following the conclusion of the regular season, contest the play-off semi-finals in a 1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd format, with the higher ranking team having home advantage. The two winners of the semi-finals then meet in the Premiership Final at Twickenham on 18 June 2022.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags to the left of player names indicate national team as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules, or primary nationality for players who have not yet earned international senior caps.

The Club is the product of a town which has a proud history of cricket dating back to the early 19th century.\nGround.\nThe club has been based on West Park since 1972. The current pavilion, built in 1992, replaced the old Vida Cricket Club pavilion, with some funds from the club, local fundraising activities, donations from the Sports Council, and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. The Club has access to potentially three pitches, the main one is situated in front of the pavilion - between the park bandstand and the bowling green.\nHistory.\nHistory of cricket in Long Eaton dates back to the early nineteenth century. The earliest known reference to a match by a Long Eaton team was recorded in the \"Nottingham Mercury\", dated 5 July 1844. The history of cricket in Long Eaton is very complicated. Many new teams sprang up from the new growing lace-making town in the 19th century, often using 'Long Eaton' in the team name. However, over time, through club mergers and player migration, these clubs along with their histories would ultimately filter down into the club that we know today. For a full history of Long Eaton's cricketing past, read Keith Breakwell's book \"The History of Cricket in Long Eaton, Sandiacre &amp; Sawley\".\nThe Club currently has 3 senior teams competing in the South Nottinghamshire Cricket League, two Sunday league teams in the Newark Club Cricket Alliance league and a long established and very successful junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Erewash Young Cricketers League.\nClub Performance.\nThe South Nottinghamshire Cricket League competition results showing the club's position (by Division) since 2005.\nThe Newark Club Cricket Alliance Sunday League competition results showing the club's position (by Division) since 2008.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"

If the country did not finish among the top eight, six slots were contested. In the end, Indonesia did not finish among the top eight, and six slots for the World Cup were contested.

        "text": "Italy national bobsleigh team is the selection that represents Italy in international bobsleigh competitions.\nThe Italian bobsleigh's body is traditionally painted with the \"rosso corsa\", the international auto racing colour informally assigned to Italy.\nHistory.\nThe sport of bobsleigh began to spread in Italy at the beginning of the 20th century, especially in Trentino and Veneto, where Federico Terschak introduced it in Cortina d'Ampezzo. In 1922, the first Italian bobsleigh championship was organised along the road of Falzarego Pass, while the following year Raffaele Zardini built the bobsleigh track in Ronco.\nThe Italian bobsleigh team debuted at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix with the five-man bobsleigh.\nIn 1925 the Bob Club of Italy was founded, which the following year established the Italian Ice Sports Federation (\"Federazione italiana sport del ghiaccio\", FISG), which also included the Italian Skating Federation (\"Federazione italiana di pattinaggio\") and the Italian Ice Hockey Federation (\"Federazione italiana di hockey sul ghiaccio\").\nAt the 1930 World Bobsleigh Championships in Caux-sur-Montreux, first edition of the event organised by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, the Italian national bobsleigh team won the gold medal with the four-man bobsleigh team of Franco Zaninetta, Giorgio Biasini, Antonio Dorini and Gino Rossi.\nIn 1933 the FISG was incorporated into the Italian Winter Sports Federation (\"Federazione Italiana Sport Invernali\", FISI); in the same year the Mottarone bobsleigh track was built on the initiative of Luigi Tornielli, in view of the World University Championships.\nAfter World War II, the Italian Winter Sports Federation turned to the Italian Air Force to look for future Italian bobsleighers among fighter pilots, imitating the US strategy: after a special course, Marshal Lamberto Dalla Costa and Major Giacomo Conti were chosen and took part in the FIBT World Championships 1953 in Garmisch. The debut of Eugenio Monti, known as the \"Flying Red\" (\"Rosso volante\"), who dominated the world bobsleigh scene in the 1950s and 1960s, dates back to these years. The first Italian successes were achieved at home at the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, where, thanks to their excellent knowledge of the Olympic track and the innovative Podar bobsleighs, the Italian national team won the gold and silver medals in the two-man bobsleigh and the silver in the four-man bobsleigh.\nAfter the extraordinary olympic success at Cortina, and the subsequent opening of the Blue Lake bobsleigh run in Cervinia in 1963, the Italian Air Force became increasingly interested in the sport and its acceleration on bends, which was useful for training its pilots. A 'bobsleigh school' was opened, renamed in 1965 as the 'Armed Forces Bobsleigh School', to train pilots, interiors and brakemen. In 1973, Italy's national military team was formed, which took part in the first edition of Military World Bobsleigh Championships in Cervinia.\nAfter a break of more than 30 years, the Air Force Sports Centre resumed winter sports activities in 2012 so that its athletes could take part in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.\nParticipation in the Winter Olympics.\nThe Italian national bobsleigh team has always taken part in at least one discipline at every Winter Olympics (except at Squaw Valley in 1960, when the organising committee did not organise any bobsleight competitions for economic reasons), winning a total of 12 Olympic medals.\nItalian women made their debut with the two-woman bobsleigh at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, while in Turin 2006 they won their first and so far only medal.\nThe largest number of Olympic medals (six) was won by Eugenio Monti, known as the \"Rosso volante\" ('Flying Red'), in whose memory the Olympic track in Cortina d'Ampezzo was named."

        "text": "The 2014 Women's Rugby World Cup Final was the final match of the 2014 Women's Rugby World Cup, played between former champions England and first-time finalists Canada on 14 August 2014 at Stade Jean-Bouin in Paris. England won the game and the World Cup for a second time, beating Canada 21–9.\nRoute to the final.\nThis was the first instance in which both finalists had been drawn together in the pool stage.\nThe teams were both drawn in Pool A and ran riot over their opposition Spain and Samoa. Canada played their first game against Spain on 1 August and a hat-trick from Magali Harvey gave the Canadians a 31–7 victory. England played only their second ever game against Samoa later the same day. They started slow and early in the match, scrum half Natasha Hunt was overturned onto her head by Samoan fullback Soteria Pulumu, which resulted in Pulumu being sent off, the first red card in a Women's World Cup. Emily Scarratt then gave England first points before Katherine Merchant scored their famous first try. Merchant would then become one of four players to score twice along with the recovered Hunt, and wingers Lydia Thompson and Kay Wilson to give the former champions a 65–3 win. Four days later on 5 August, Canada and England defeated Samoa and Spain 42–7 and 45–5 respectively, playing in a similar fashion, both teams scoring five tries from five different scorers.\nHaving the superior historical form, superior scorelines against Spain and Samoa, as well as their most recent outing with Canada being a comfortable 32–9 win, England were favourites to take the final match of the pool on 9 August. Canada had the confidence with their first and second wins over England in the 2013 Nations Cup. England scored early on with a penalty from Emily Scarratt, with a quick response from a Canadian try of Karen Paquin, with Magali Harvey's conversion missed. The score remained 3–5 until another Scarratt penalty in stoppage time; England leading 6–5 at half-time. Canada scored another quick try in the second half from Kayla Mack, again unconverted from Harvey. Scarratt however was able to convert the try of vice-captain Sarah Hunter to take the lead back for England a third time, before Harvey's late penalty brought the scores level. What was to follow would become controversial over forthcoming years. England were awarded a penalty again in stoppage time that was easily kickable to the posts, the teams however discussed the decision, and agreed England should kick the ball into touch for a draw instead of over the posts for a win. This was after defending four-time champions New Zealand were upset by Ireland four days earlier. By drawing the game, the Black Ferns would be eliminated with both England and Canada going through with Ireland and hosts France. Had England gone for the posts, this would have meant New Zealand would have gone through instead of Canada, which both teams did not desire as Canada would have been knocked out and England had been beaten by New Zealand in the last three finals. In the tournament, the draw resulted in New Zealand being knocked out of the tournament for the first time since losing to the United States in the semi-finals in 1991, as well as guaranteeing new finalists as England were the only former finalists that had qualified for the 1st-4th semi-finals. Outside of the tournament, along with Canada failing to qualify for the 1st-4th semi-finals in 2017, the draw resulted in the format being changed for the 2021 tournament so that there would be quarter-finals preceding the semi-finals.\nWith the teams drawing, they were seeded 3rd and 4th overall, with England playing 2nd ranked Ireland, and Canada against 1st ranked France. Having only ever lost one out of their six semi-finals and being against Ireland who hadn't yet played one, England were predicted to win the game despite their recent form against the Irish which had dwindled in recent games. England were not seen to be outright favourites as Ireland had recently beaten New Zealand for the first time and won the Grand Slam in the Six Nations the previous year. Canada had the much harder task of defeating the current Six Nations Grand Slam champions France. With the Black Ferns gone, France were new favourites along with England having claimed the Grand Slam for the first time since 2005. The semi-finals commenced on 14 August, with England playing Ireland first. Ireland fielded the exact same side that beat the Black Ferns and pressurised England until scoring first after quarter of an hour. England however, took cruise control and replied with 40 unanswered points with tries from Rochelle Clark, Katherine Merchant, Kay Wilson and two from Marlie Packer; a performance that seemed like those England had previously put over Ireland. In the other game, Canada came out mostly second-best against the hosts. This was until an end-to-end solo effort from Magali Harvey, an effort that would win her the IRB Women's Player of the Year and subsequently Women's Try of the Decade. France responded but Canada held on to win, their second consecutive win over France in France, and made their first final, resulting in France's sixth successive semi-final defeat. England meanwhile entered their fourth successive final, and sixth overall.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nEngland were favourites for the same reason, and they dominated the entire game with two Emily Scarratt penalties before Karen Paquin prevented tries from Katherine Merchant and Natasha Hunt. England however did score when Canadian skipper Kelly Russell was fooled by a Tamara Taylor dummy, giving England an overlap sending Danielle Waterman into score their first try. Scarratt's conversion went bizarrely wide but England still had a healthy 11–0 lead. Magali Harvey then scored a penalty before halftime to make the score 11–3. Harvey then continued England's lead after the break to 11–9. England then entered cruise control as they did against Ireland first with a response from Scarratt restoring the score to 14–9. In the last quarter, play was mostly contested in England's half, but a miscommunication between centres Rachael Burford and Scarratt confused both England's attack and Canada's defence, allowing Scarratt to break several lines to score the winner. She comfortably converted to put England twelve points clear with five minutes left. England won their second Women's Rugby World Cup, their first in twenty years, and their third overall Rugby World Cup triumph.\nEngland captain Katy McLean dedicated the win to the England legends who fell short in recent years. Both captains complimented each other's performances and marked the game as steps as journeys both teams started long ago, with it being England's end.\nMaggie Alphonsi, Sophie Hemming and Joanna McGilchrist all retired from international rugby. Katherine Merchant suffered multiple concussions which would lead to her retirement before being able to play another international game. Most other England players would take up the sevens game before returning to rugby union after the 2016 Olympics to win their first Six Nations since the winning the World Cup in 2017. England captain Katy McLean and vice-captain Sarah Hunter received MBEs at the 2014 New Years Honours. Gary Street stepped down as head coach, having been in charge since 2006, to coach Aylesford Bulls Ladies to win in the 2015–16 Women's Premiership, and continued when the club evolved into Harlequins Women."

Billy protested one night that he was working at the skinworks and finished at 6pm and with training starting at half past he struggled to get down in time for the start. Well, the next day he gets home from work and there’s a bike at his door.\"\nHe moved on from the skinworks to become a manager of a slaughterhouse. Later he ran his own business running kennels and breeding dogs.\nOther interests.\nHe took up golf and had a single-figure handicap. He often played with Bill McLaren.\nHe bred canaries to a national standard, and won Scottish titles.\nHe participated in the Hawick Common Riding.

Each team play each other in a double-round-robin tournament over the two years, with the winners and runners-up of the two-year cycle qualifying for the World Cup as Europe 1 and Europe 2 respectively. The third placed team advances to the Final qualification tournament as Europe 3.\nThe qualification process did not include the remaining three divisions in the Rugby Europe system that are typically included across play-off matches due to the time scale restraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEntrants.\nSix teams competed during the European qualifiers for the 2023 Rugby World Cup; teams World Rankings are prior to the first European qualification matches on 6 March.\nRugby Europe Championship.\nTable.\nFor the Rugby Europe Championship teams, results were considered on a 2-year aggregate from the 2021 and 2022 seasons; the winner and runner-up teams automatically qualified for the tournament as Europe 1 and Europe 2 individually, leaving the team in third place to qualify for the Final qualification tournament as Europe 3.\nFollowing the Russian military invasion of Ukraine, Rugby Europe suspended all Russian games on home soil on 25 February 2022 before later suspending Russia at all levels with immediate effect on 1 March 2022. This later resulted in the cancelled games being declared a walkover and the opposition of Russia would be given 4 points.\nGeorgia were confirmed as Europe 1 following a walkover result against Russia whilst on 13 March, Spain had secured Europe 2 with a win over Portugal. However, on 28 March, it was announced Spain would be investigated for fielding an ineligible player, the South Africa-born Gavin Van Den Berg, in two World Cup qualifying matches against the Netherlands. On 28 April 2022, an independent judicial committee determined that Spain did breach the regulation, and deducted 10 points from the table. This resulted in Spain dropping out of the top three qualifying/play-off places meaning Romania qualified as Europe 2 and Portugal would proceed to the play-offs. Spain later appealed the decision, but the appeal was unsuccessful and the original decision was upheld. This meant Romania qualified as Europe 2 and Portugal advanced to the play-offs as Europe 3.\nFixtures.\n2022.\nPortugal awarded 4 points."

        "text": "Royal Fremantle Golf Club is a golf club in Fremantle, Western Australia. It was established in 1905. Multiple prominent golf tournaments have been hosted at the venue including the Australian PGA Championship and Royal Fremantle Open.\nHistory.\nIn 1904, roughly twenty people who lived in the Fremantle area met regularly at His Lordship’s Parlor, a local hotel, to talk about creating a golf course. On July 20, 1905 the club was formally created. For the site of the course, the members quickly decided to use 196 acres of government land that was currently being leased to cattle famers. In early August, the Fremantle Municipal Council approved a loan of £500 to assist with the development of the first nine holes. A month later, in September, the club was formally established with 60 members and, in November, formally incorporated.\nHowever, there were many problems converting the designated territory into a golf course. The terrain was rocky and had an inadequate water supply. Cattle, rabbits, and goats regularly trespassed into the land. The goats were especially problematic, as they would often eat \"young tree plantings as fast as they were planted.\" The establishment of \"pig\" wire netting was originally recommended but, in efforts to save money, the club ultimately decided to construct warning signs \"that goats trespassing on the Links Reserve will be shot.\" \nDespite the challenges, by 1906 the first nine holes \"became playable.\" The following year the Governor of Western Australia officially opened the course. In 1909 the full 18 holes were completed. Fremantle became the first 18-hole course in the state. Two years later it hosted the state's inaugural amateur championship. It also hosted a club championship in 1909. \nMembership climbed the first decade of the club's history but abruptly dropped during World War I. By 1930, however, membership had returned to pre-war levels. In addition in 1930, the Crown certified the club's \"Royal status.\" Royal Fremantle was then \"the Premier Club in Western Australia.\" \nThe course has hosted several significant golf tournaments over its history. In 1960 it hosted the Australian PGA Championship. In the late 1970s and early 80s it hosted the Royal Fremantle Open.\nThe club celebrated its centenary in 2005.\nOther Information.\nThe course is long. The course has Kikuyu fairways and Bentgrass greens.\nIn the early 1980s the course record of 66 was established. It stood for 25 years until 2006 when Ric Kulacz, a local amateur player, shot a 64. This record was tied by Paul Fenton in 2009 at the course's club championship.\nMinjee Lee, currently one of the top female golfers in the world, honed her game at the club. Touring professionals Craig Parry and Greg Chalmers both graduated from the club's junior program."

The tour was confirmed a day after Ireland's tour of Zimbabwe was cancelled. The original tour schedule included two Twenty20 matches, but one was dropped from the itinerary on 13 March 2021.\nThe first unofficial ODI match was abandoned after 30 overs, after Ruhan Pretorius tested positive for COVID-19. Ahead of the second ODI, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) confirmed that the match would take place, after all players returned a negative test. Pretorius' test was later found to be a false positive, with him returning to the squad for the second match.\nSquads.\nOriginally, George Dockrell was set to captain the Ireland Wolves in the unofficial Test, and Harry Tector would lead the side in the limited overs matches. However, the day before the squad departed for Bangladesh, it was announced that Dockrell had opted out of the tour. The same day, Ruhan Pretorius was added to the squad and Tector was confirmed as captain."

        "text": "Brian L. Cornell was a Canadian ice hockey winger who was a two-time All-American for Cornell University.\nCareer.\nCornell was not a star player in juniors, averaging less than a point per game for the Niagara Falls Flyers. Despite the low production, he was recruited to Cornell University and began attending in the fall of 1965. Cornell played on a freshman team alongside Ken Dryden that went undefeated. A year later Cornell was a member of the varsity squad and began the season as a depth scorer for the team. In the first ten games he recorded 13 points but, in the first game of the Boston Arena Christmas Tournament, Cornell tore ligaments in his knee and missed the remainder of the season. Cornell was forced to watch as the Big Red nearly ran the table without him and captured the program's first NCAA Championship and the first championship of any kind since 1911.\nCornell was ready for the start of the following season and, with many of the '67 Big Red's top scorers graduating, he was able to assume a more prominent role in the offense. Cornell had a breakout season, leading the team with 29 goals and 61 points in 28 games. He was named Second Team All-conference and All-American and helped Cornell compile an astounding 26–1 record heading into the national tournament. The team, however, was stifled by Mike Curran in the semifinal and lost 1–3. The Big Red finished 3rd in the tournament and Cornell was the only player not in the title match to appear on the All-Tournament First Team. As a senior, Cornell was named team co-Captain with Bruce Pattison and responded by setting a program record for points in a season with 74. He finished third in the nation and was an All-American once more. The Big Red again entered the NCAA Tournament 26–1 but, despite a scare from Michigan Tech, reached the championship match. Cornell scored his final collegiate goal in the second period to tie the score at 2-all, but Denver carried the day in the third and skated away with the championship.\nAfter graduating, Cornell remained at the university in the Graduate School of Business and Public Administration. While he continued his studies he both coached the freshman team in its final year of existence and played for the Syracuse Stars in the team's last season. He was inducted into the Cornell Athletic Hall of Fame in 1969."

It had a total purse of $850,000.\nTournament.\nThe 2021 All England Open became the second tournament of the 2021 BWF World Tour following the postponement of the 2021 German Open due to the ongoing pandemic. It was part of the All England Open championships, which had been held since 1899. This tournament was organized by Badminton England and sanctioned by the BWF.\nVenue.\nThis tournament was held at Utilita Arena Birmingham in Birmingham, England.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is the point distribution for each phase of the tournament based on the BWF points system for the BWF World Tour Super 1000 event. This tournament would not be calculated in qualification ranking of 2020 Summer Olympics.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize money for this tournament was US$850,000. Distribution of prize money was in accordance with BWF regulations.\nControversies.\nOn 17 March 2021 night local time, BWF stated that all Indonesian players competing in the tournament, including all three who had won in the first round, were withdrawn from the tournament after 20 of 24 people from the team were contacted by the NHS Test and Trace service via e-mail, and were required to enter 10-day isolation. They were contacted by the NHS after someone on the same inbound flight from Istanbul to Birmingham with the team was tested positive for COVID-19. The entire team was forced to walk on foot from the arena to the hotel as their shuttle service was prevented from taking them to the hotel.\nThis sparked controversy between Indonesian players and the BWF. The Indonesians protested because 3 Indian players who are tested positive before the tournament, though 24 hours later tested negative after self testing, were allowed to play on the tournament, while all of Indonesian team members had tested negative for the virus. The start of the tournament itself had been delayed for five hours after 7 of COVID-19 results were deemed inconclusive. The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) also stated that Turkish badminton player Neslihan Yiğit and her trainer who were on the same flight with the Indonesian team from Istanbul to Birmingham, but Yiğit was allowed to continue her tournament. On 18 March noon local time, Yiğit was announced to had also been withdrawn from the tournament by the BWF.\nEarlier, the first round of the men's doubles between Indonesians Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan and English pair Ben Lane and Sean Vendy sparked backlashes because of an arrangement where the service judge on duty, Alan Crow, was also English. However, according to the rules, BWF never explicitly prohibits a technical official to officiate a match involving athletes from the same country with the technical official against athletes from another country.\nIndonesian National Olympic Committee also alleged unprofessional and discriminatory treatment by BWF, as Indonesian team are not allowed to use lifts and take the bus by the organizers. On 22 March, the president of BWF Poul-Erik Høyer Larsen officially apologizes to Indonesian Youth and Sports Minister for the circumstances faced by Indonesian team during the event."

        "text": "Francisco Javier Álvarez (born November 19, 2001), nicknamed Alvy or The Troll, is a Venezuelan professional baseball catcher for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB).\nEarly life.\nÁlvarez was born in Guatire, Venezuela. Between his father, José, and mother, Yolanda, Álvarez had two older siblings and an older half-brother. His sister died when she was a teenager.\nAs a youth, Álvarez developed his strength by working for his father's construction company. He dropped out of school to pursue baseball full-time at eleven years old, by which point he was already playing in international tournaments. He later received his high school diploma via the New York Mets' Latin American baseball academy.\nInspired by fellow Venezuelan catcher Henry Blanco, Álvarez started catching at twelve years old.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nÁlvarez signed with the New York Mets as an international free agent in July 2018. He spent his first professional season in 2019 with the Gulf Coast Mets and Kingsport Mets, batting .312 with seven home runs and 26 runs batted in (RBI) over 42 games with both teams. Álvarez did not play a minor league game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Mets invited Álvarez to their spring training in 2021. He split the season between the St. Lucie Mets and the Brooklyn Cyclones, slashing .272/.388/.554 with 24 home runs and 70 RBI over 99 games. In June, Álvarez was selected to play in the All-Star Futures Game, in which he homered.\nÁlvarez again participated in spring training with the Mets in 2022.\nMajor Leagues.\nÁlvarez was called up by the New York Mets on September 30, 2022 and made his major league debut as a designated hitter on the same day against the Atlanta Braves. After going hitless in his first eight at bats, Álvarez hit a 439-foot home run off of Washington Nationals reliever Carl Edwards Jr. It was also the first Major League game in which he played catcher. He was the youngest player to appear in the Major Leagues in 2022.\nÁlvarez was optioned to the Triple-A Syracuse Mets to begin the 2023 season. His time in Triple-A did not last long, as he was recalled to the Mets on April 7 following a leg injury to Omar Narvaez. He platooned with backup catcher Tomás Nido, and after an impressive slashline, became the starting catcher; Nido was DFA'ed when Narvaez came back. Álvarez hit .244 with 11 homers and 23 RBI. He had two home runs on June 8 against the Atlanta Braves, making franchise history as the second youngest Mets player to hit 3 home runs in a 2-game span since Darryl Strawberry (1983). Álvarez is also the 12th player in MLB history with at least 12 home runs in the first 46 career games under the age of 22.\nOn June 10, during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Álvarez made MLB history when he passed Johnny Bench for the most home runs in the first 45 games played in a season for primary-position catchers at the age of 21 or younger. Álvarez's 13 home runs in 49 games is second to catcher Gary Sánchez (19). He also joined Will Smith and Evan Gattis, both with 13 home runs.\nOn July 4th, Álvarez hit his 14th home run, a 467-foot shot to dead center off relief pitcher Miguel Castro, during a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. With this homer he broke the Mets record for most home runs by a rookie catcher, surpassing Travis d'Arnaud (13 HR, 2014), Jason Phillips (11 HR, 2003), and Todd Hundley (7 HR, 1992). On July 29, during a game against the Washington Nationals, Álvarez hit his 20th home run (off Andrés Machado), becoming only the second 21-year-old catcher to reach 20 home runs in a season. On September 30, during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Álvarez hit his first career grand slam off of pitcher Michael Plassmeyer. In 2023, Álvarez played in 123 games for the Mets, batting .209/.284/.437 with 25 home runs and 63 RBIs.\nOn April 20, 2024, he was placed on the 15-day injured list with a left thumb sprain following a stumble while rounding first base in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Later that day, it was announced that he had torn a ligament in his left thumb and would need surgery. An eight–week recovery timetable was given for his return. Tomás Nido was called up from Syracuse to replace Álvarez.\nPersonal life.\nÁlvarez has several tattoos. He has cited the lion on his left arm as his favorite. His other tattoos include the word \"grateful\" on his neck, the words \"family first\" and tributes to his parents and late sister. \nWhen Álvarez came to the United States for his first professional season at 16 years old, his parents accompanied him to help ease the transition. At that time, he spoke no English, and had to rely on older teammate José Butto to speak the language on his behalf. After studying diligently with Mets staff, getting help from coaches and teammates such as Brett Baty and doing mock interviews with SNY reporter Steve Gelbs, Álvarez was able to conduct live television interviews in English before the start of the 2024 season."

This will be the first season of UEFA Champions League played under a new format where in the League phase each team plays eight games against different opponents but all 36 teams are ranked in a joint league.\nThe final will be played on 7 June 2025 at Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. The winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League will automatically qualify for the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League league phase, earn the right to play against the winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League in the 2025 UEFA Super Cup, 2025 FIFA Intercontinental Cup, and potentially enter the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup (this is yet to be determined).\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 83 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations are set to participate in the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein which does not organise a domestic league and Russia which is currently suspended). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\nAssociation ranking.\nFor the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League, the associations are allocated places according to their 2023 UEFA association coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 2018–19 to 2022–23. The table reflects Russia's ongoing suspension from UEFA.\nApart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations may have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\nDistribution.\nThe information here reflects the ongoing suspension of Russia in European football, and so the following changes to the default access list have been made:\nShould the Champions League title holders have qualified via their domestic league, then the club (Champions Path only) with highest club coefficient will enter the league phase.\nShould the Europa League title holders have qualified via their domestic league, then the club (Champions Path &amp; League Path) with the highest club coefficient will enter the league phase, except for the runners-up of associations 11–15, as they have higher-ranked domestic team in the qualifiers.\nTeams.\nThe labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:\nThe second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round are divided into Champions Path (CH) and League Path (LP).\nSchedule.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows. Compared to past seasons, \"exclusive week\" will be introduced in which Thursday will also be a matchday. All matches in other weeks will be played on Tuesdays and Wednesdays apart from the final.\nLeague phase.\nQualified teams\nKnockout phase.\nThe top eight sides in the league will qualify automatically for the knockout phase, while the teams finishing in 9th to 24th place will compete in a two-legged play-off to secure their path to the last 16. The winners will join the top eight in that round. Meanwhile, teams that finish 25th or lower will be eliminated, with no access to the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League."

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all games were played on campus locations, rather than the semifinal and final match traditionally being hosted at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. The UMass Minutemen defeated the UMass Lowell River Hawks to earn their 1st Hockey East tournament championship, and earned the conference's automatic bid into the 2021 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament.\nThe tournament was the 36th in league history.\nFormat.\nDue to the difficulties of scheduling during the regular season, it was announced in late 2020 that all 11 Hockey East teams qualified for the tournament. After further complications and cancellations throughout the season, a formula-based ranking system called the Hockey East Power Index (HEPI) was implemented to determine seeding. Additionally, the tournament was formatted so that all rounds would be single-elimination games, rather than traditionally a best-of-three series in the opening and quarterfinals rounds.\nOn March 5, it was announced that Merrimack would be unable to participate in the tournament due to a late positive test result among the team's Tier-I personnel. As a result, the 11-team tournament format was reduced to a 10-team format, and teams ranked below Merrimack in the final HEPI standings would move up a seed to compensate.\nSeeds 7-10 will play a single elimination opening round game on March 10, 2021, as seeds 1-6 will earn a bye to the next round. Winning teams will be reseeded and then play a single elimination quarterfinal game on March 14, 2021. Following an additional reseeding, the four victorious teams will advance to the semifinals on March 17, 2021. The final two programs will battle in the championship game on March 20, 2021.\nBracket.\nTeams are reseeded after the Opening Round and Quarterfinals"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Dons represent University of San Francisco in the NCAA's West Coast Conference.\nSan Francisco began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1923. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but San Francisco's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the leader of the young rider classification, and wore the white jersey.\nThere was also the team classification. After each stage, the times of the three highest finishers of each team were added together, and all the members of the leading team wore a red number bib on the following stage. The victory was awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative time at the end of the event.\nIn addition, there was one individual award: the combativity award. This award was given after each stage (excluding the individual time trial) to the rider \"who displayed the most generous effort and best sporting spirit.\" The daily winner wore a yellow number bib the following stage. At the end of the Vuelta, a jury decided the top three riders for the \"Most Combative Rider of\nLa Vuelta\", with a public vote deciding the victor."

In each zone, the top two teams advanced to the \"Fase Campeón\" while the bottom two teams advanced to the \"Fase Complementación\".\nIn the \"Fase Campeón\", the 12 qualified teams were split into two groups of six teams each, where they played a single round-robin tournament. The winners of each group played the final match at a neutral venue. The winner of the \"Fase Campeón\" final were crowned champion of the cup also qualifying for Copa Libertadores.\nOn the other hand, teams in \"Fase Complementación\" played under the same format as in the \"Fase Campeón\". The winners of the \"Fase Complementación\" final played a match against the \"Fase Campeón\" runners-up with the winners qualifying for the Copa Sudamericana.\nThe second edition had a similar format with a total of 26 teams including two promoted from Primera Nacional. Teams were drawn into two groups of 13 teams each, playing on a single round-robin a total of 13 rounds.\nList of champions.\nFinals played:\nTop scorers.\nTop 5 goalscorers, all-time (only group stage games)\n\"Updated as of 8 January 2024\""

The game is also broadcast nationally by ESPN Radio and by ESPN International for Latin America. In 2013, ESPN Deportes provided the first Spanish language telecast in the U.S. of the Rose Bowl Game.\nThe Rose Bowl game contract with ESPN was extended on June 28, 2012, to 2026, for a reportedly $80 million per year.\nABC years (1989–2010).\nFrom 1989 to 2010, the game was broadcast on ABC, usually at 2 p.m. PST; the 2005 edition was the first one broadcast in HDTV. The first 9-year contract in 1988 started at about $11 million, which is what NBC had been paying. The 2002 Rose Bowl was the first broadcast not set at the traditional 2:00pm West Coast time. Beginning in 2007, FOX had the broadcast rights to the other Bowl Championship Series games, but the Rose Bowl, which negotiates its own television contract independent of the BCS, had agreed to keep the game on ABC.\nNBC years (1952–88).\nThe 1952 Rose Bowl, on NBC, was the first national telecast of a college football game. The network broadcast both the Tournament of Roses Parade and the following game. The 1956 Rose Bowl has the highest TV rating of all college bowl games, watched by 41.1% of all people in the US with TV sets. The 1962 game was the first college football game broadcast in color. Television ratings for the Rose Bowl declined as the number of bowl games increased. The other bowl games also provided more compelling match-ups, with higher-ranked teams. In 1988, NBC gave up the broadcast rights, as the television share dropped in 1987 below 20."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bulldogs represent the University of Georgia in the NCAA's Southeastern Conference.\nGeorgia began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1895. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Georgia's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21f season."

The 1st and 2nd XI teams use the Victoria Avenue pitch, rated by the DCCL as a Grade A+ ground, and the 3rd and 4th XI use the pitch in the field behind the pavilion, rated as a Grade A ground.\nHistory.\nHistory of cricket in the village of Ockbrook dates back to the mid nineteenth century, where a match report was recorded between Ockbrook and \"Sawley Club\" in the \"Derby and Chesterfield Reporter\" on 27 October 1843. However, the official club records state the establishment of Ockbrook &amp; Borrowash CC to be 1850. It is not clear where the original club ground was, but by 1898, the club acquired the use of the present ground on land adjoining the Queens Head off Victoria Avenue, the same year the club joined the Sandiacre and Ilkeston District league. During the 1950s and 60s, concerted efforts were made to improve the ground facilities and the image and fortunes of the club began to steadily improve. The club won the Butterly Cup in 1972, its first trophy for many years. Shortly afterwards, the club entered the Derby and District League, doing well enough to enter Division 1 in 1974, and becoming Div 1 runner-up and League Cup winners in 1974; Div 1 winners in 1975; Div 1 winners and League cup runner-up in 1976. In the early 1980s the old pavilion was damaged by fire, resulting in a new pavilion opening in 1985. In 1999, Ockbrook &amp; Borrowash CC became the first champions of the newly formed Premier Division of the Derbyshire County Cricket League. After subsequent improvements to the ground, gaining a Grade A rating, the adjoining ground behind the pavilion was added in 2002. The pavilion was extended in 2004, followed by the addition of a scorebox in 2008.\nThe club currently has 4 senior teams competing in the Derbyshire County Cricket League and a long established and very successful junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Erewash Young Cricketers League.\nClub performance.\nThe Derbyshire County Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 1999.\nThe Mansfield and District Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league by Section (Division) since 2013.\nThe Derbyshire Cricket Board Indoor Competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 2017."

        "title": "Baseball in France",
        "text": "Baseball is a growing minor sport in France. The sport in France is managed by the French Federation of Baseball and Softball, founded in October 1924. The first match played on French soil dates back to March 8 1889 as part of the Spalding World Tour\n while a first championship was born before the First World War. Despite these ancient roots, baseball is perceived in France as an exotic sport in the American image. The French media give it very little space.\nRecognized as a high level sport by the Ministry of Sports, baseball takes full advantage of the characteristic structures of French sport, DTN and high level poles first and foremost. This training-oriented policy has borne fruit with encouraging first results, such as the 11th place of the French junior team at the World Championship in 2010 with a first international French victory and the signing of four French with professional organizations of Major Leagues between 2007 and 2012: Joris Bert, Frédéric Hanvi, Andy Paz and Alexandre Roy\nThe French national team remains behind the two strong European nations: Italy and the Netherlands. The situation is similar in club baseball, but the Rouen Huskies showed that it was possible to shake up the European hierarchy by reaching the final of the European Baseball Cup in 2007 and the semifinal in 2012.\nHistory.\nFrom the origins to 1914: dreams full of head.\nThe first Spalding tour which passed in 1874 through England and Ireland was also to occur in Paris but the match scheduled is canceled. The first baseball match played on French soil finally took place on March 8 1889 on the occasion of the international exhibition, in the part of the Spalding World Tour, at the Parc Aérostatique de Paris in front of 1500 spectators. The game was between a selection of players from the National League and the club, Chicago White Stockings. Albert Spalding prioritizes this game because he feels the Paris market holds a lot of promise.\nThe \" Los Angeles Times \" devotes on May 17 1908 an article on the development of baseball in France. The Americans in Paris but also French players have been practicing since the last decade of the 19th century. In the wake of the match of March 8 1889, the main Parisian school clubs have set up thèque or baseball sections. According to ongoing research by Patrick Tugault, the Athletic Association of Lycée Janson-de-Sailly seems to be a pioneer (1890) before the École alsacienne, Lycée Saint-Louis and Lycée Hoche (1891). The Stade français (1893) then the Racing Club de France (1897) follow the movement as well as the Anglo-Saxon Parisian establishments : Anglo American AC (1897) and Anglo-Saxon School AC (1898), for example.\nThe industrialist Émile Dubonnet became a baseball fan in 1911. Enthusiastic about the future of the discipline in France, he helped in 1913 to finance the first national championship. The Parisian hen is based on the championship of the \" Paris Baseball Association\", chaired by the American Frank B. Ellis, while a provincial group is formed. In Paris, the main clubs are Ranelagh BBC (Bagatelle), Spalding AC (Vésinet), Paris Team (American students from Paris), A.A. (Lycée Condorcet) and the Racing Club de France. In the provinces, we can cite Rugby Nantes, Olympique Seynois, Évreux AC, US Berry and AS Macon.\nIn 1914, the year opens with the passage to Nice then to Paris of the world tour of Chicago White Sox and the New York Giants. On February 13, Chicago won 10–9 in Nice after a good match. After several days of rain, the Paris match is finally held despite bad weather conditions.\nFrance acquired many fields and baseball began to attract crowds and as a result there were up to 3,000 spectators at a single championship match at Le Vésinet. Spalding, who also supports the young French league, is delighted by this development and declares that \"the next country of baseball will be France\". The outbreak of World War I drastically ended these hopes.\n1914-1945: from one war to another.\nDuring the First World War, Canadian soldiers were the first to practice baseball in their free time on the French front. The Canadians initiate many British and French soldiers, who are described as \"enthusiastic practitioners\" by the \" New York Times\" in 1915. Arrived in 1918, the Americans multiply the meetings. Thus, on July 4, 1918, nearly 20,000 spectators attended Rouen a match between American soldiers . Many Major League players were present in the US military and on the field.\nAt the end of the war, baseball entered the university, notably in Paris, Toulouse, Lyon, Nice and Dijon while the bats are now produced locally. Christy Mathewson who is stationed in France is very reserved on the level of French players declaring in 1919 to \"The Washington Post\" that they have more afraid of a baseball than a German grenade. John McGraw, on the other hand, is more optimistic.\nIn 1920, the Standard AC won the Paris championship organized by the Parisian baseball league. The following year, the National Baseball League was founded. Chaired by Gaston François, it brings together the League of Paris and that of the North. Its objectives are to popularize the practice in France, to provide Paris with facilities to practice this sport and obtain recognition from the Olympic Committee.\nOn the occasion of the Summer Olympics in Paris in 1924, an exhibition match is being held on July 18 in between a formation named All Stars USA and the Ranelagh BBC. The Americans win 5–0. At the end of the summer, on August 31, a match pompously baptized the European World Series, opposes the Stade Elisabeth Stadium in Paris, selections of Parisian and London players. The Paris All Stars win by 15 to 8 over the London Americans. After having already won in London for the first leg a few days earlier.\nIn November 1924, two Major League Baseball (MLB) teams met in a friendly exhibition match in Paris: the pennant-winning New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox played at Stade de Colombes in front of 4000 spectators. One commentator doubted that the sport would gain popularity in France, writing that the French preferred games that were more instinctive to them, and pronouncing that \"football and rugby are not in danger of being dethroned.\"\nIn the wake of this meeting, the French Federation of baseball and thèque was created. Frantz Reichel is the president while John McGraw and Charles Comiskey are named honorary vice-presidents. Reichel's motivations remain mysterious. Officially, he \"organizes\" baseball in France; unofficially, he muzzles him. Two facts illustrate this situation. Reichel does not recognize the American primacy over the discipline and especially puts forward the thèque, but also, and above all, France, and all of Europe, will no longer receive the American Major League tours. However, two groups made the trip to Europe in 1926, but no one wanted to see them play, in Paris or in London. This last American tour in Europe will be satisfied with matches in Ireland. In fact, Reichel is one of the leading figures in the fight against professionalism and he is afraid that baseball will experience this development on the Old Continent. 1924 indeed marks a turning point at this level with the adoption of professionalism by Austrian football; a first in continental Europe for a team sport.\nThe federation set up a French championship in 1926 which incorporated a few clubs from the Parisian baseball league such as Sporting Bedford Eco, Paris Champion in 1923. AS Transport won the first national title on August 22 in 1926 by winning 15–10 in the final at Colombes against Ranelagh BBC.\nInitiated to play during the war, the French army continued its practice during the 1920s and even considered adopting it as an official sport for training soldiers. This idea was abandoned in the 1930s.\nIn 1929, the France team made their debut against their Spanish counterpart. The French won 10–6 at Barcelona on the occasion of this first outing. In the 1930s, the France - Netherlands opposition became a classic. The Dutch won the first opposition in Paris 9–5, then won again in Amsterdam. The French take away their first victory in the third match, in Paris, 5–4. A three-way tournament with the Belgium takes place at the end of the 1930s.\n1945-1980: relaunch failure.\nThe Second World War marks a severe halt to baseball in France. Ihis was not the case in the Netherlands. At the Liberation, French baseball was in ruins. The American soldiers reintroduced the sport and multiplied the meetings, even in the medium-sized towns (Auxerre, Compiègne, etc.). The 33rd Division Blackcats are the most famous training of the summer 1945. They had a few Major League players including Dave Koslo, pitcher for the New York Giants, and Merv Connors, first base for the Chicago White Sox. They have 30 wins for 4 losses.\nPresident of the French baseball Federation since 1931, Georges Bruni is very close to Reichel's theses, but he is a genuine fan of the game. His action remains limited until 1945, when replacement by Thierry Blanchard (1945 - 1955). It was under the latter's authority that the Confederation of European Baseball was created in Paris on April 27, 1953. France even manages to impose the exclusive use of a French vocabulary on the whole of Europe. This does not last long. In exchange, the posts of president, vice-president and secretary are left to Italians, Spaniards and Belgians.\nBetween 1944 and the 1950s, a solid nucleus developed in Tunisia, then still under French authority. The Americans are at the origin of this movement while the Tunisian League has been active since 1920 is mainly the work of Marcel Cohen. The first matches between the French team and the selection of Tunisia are favorable to African players (11-5 in 1949). The French team of 1955 which participates in the European championship includes many of these Tunisian players. Despite this reinforcement, France signs four defeats for no success in this competition. These mediocre results remained the norm until the 1980s. Between 1955 and 1983, the French team only had 2 victories for 39 defeats in the European championship.\nSince 1980.\nOnly 21 clubs were active in France in 1976. In ten years, we have grown to more than 170 clubs and in 1989, France hosted the 21st edition of the European Baseball Championship. For the occasion, land meeting international standards is being built in the Bois de Vincennes. According to a census carried out by the Confederation of European Baseball, France has in 2006 153 fields including 13 with international standards, 30 fields entirely dedicated to baseball and 110 other fields. France had the opportunity to take advantage of the organization in Paris of a group for the 2009 World Cup to equip themselves, but the Federation prefers to give up organizing these meetings, due to lack of stadiums and commitment partners, the International Baseball Federation first and foremost.\nThe purely amateur character of French baseball is now a thing of the past. Foreign players and coaches can now hope to earn a few thousand euros per month by playing in French clubs. The cases are still rare, but they exist since the years 1990. Thus, the Canadian Steve Scagnetti receives a monthly salary of $2500 during his time with the Lions of Savigny-sur-Orge. The best player playing in France during the 1990s is the Canadian Jeff Zimmerman who takes advantage of the low level of opposition to develop his shots. He is very critical of the level of play in the French championship, which he assesses at the same level as the junior colleges in the United States. Zimmerman went on to play in Major League from 1999 to 2001 and had a selection All-Star (1999).\nThe departure of the young center fielder of the Rouen Huskies, Joris Bert, in the school clubs of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2007 confirms the effectiveness of the training policy put in place with the support of the Ministry of Sports and the MLB. The American Major League also organizes training camps in France in order to observe the evolution of young French players and direct the best to the United States. A few months after Joris Bert, the young Frédéric Hanvi was recruited by the organization of Minnesota Twins. In January 2011, the Franco-Cuban Andy Paz-Garriga signed with the Oakland Athletics.\nOn June 16, 2007, the Rouen Huskies take part in the final of the European Cup. This great first for a French club ended in a 3–1 defeat against the Dutch Kinheim. Two years later, Rouen managed to win in a group match against the Champions of Netherlands, the Amsterdam Pirates (8-5 in 6 sets, match interrupted by rain). This is the first French victory in the European Cup against a Dutch club.\nIn 2012 the Rouen Huskies once again qualify for the European \" semi-final \" but lost in the semi-final against the Italians from Bologna. The same year Alexandre Roy became the 4th Frenchman to sign a professional contract with a franchise of Major League Baseball, the Seattle Mariners.\nAlso in 2012, France won the European Under-21 Championship, the first European title of the Federation since its creation, and the Senior France Team participates in World Baseball Classic Qualifying Round, a new benchmark international competition.\nGoverning board.\nThe sport is governed by the French Federation of Baseball and Softball.\nDomestic League.\nThe French Division 1 Baseball Championship is the highest level of professional baseball in the country."

        "text": "Baseball is a growing, minor sport in Italy The sport is governed by the Italian Baseball Softball Federation (, or FIBS). Founded in 1948, the Italian Baseball League (officially the \"Serie A\") is the highest level of professional baseball in Italy.\nHistory.\nThe Spalding World Tour of 1889 brought baseball to Italy for the first time, playing three matches in the country. On February 19 in Naples, the \"All-Americans\", a selection of all-star players from the National League won 8-2 against the Chicago White Stockings; on the 23rd at Rome in Piazza di Siena in Villa Borghese, Chicago won 3-2; and on the 25th, in Florence, the \"All-Americans\" won 7-4. A second American tour passed through Italy in February 1913, conducted by the Chicago White Sox. After failing to find a suitable field in Naples and experiencing unconducive weather in Rome, the team left Italy without playing a single game.\nThe real establishment of baseball in Italy began in 1919 under the leadership of Max Otto. A native of Turin under the name Mario Ottino, he spent several years in United States where he became a baseball fan. He returned to Italy after the First World War with equipment and the desire to develop the sport there. The other father of Italian baseball is the Rome native Guido Graziani, who had been organizing matches in Rome since 1920. Despite Otto and Graziani's best efforts, baseball failed to gain interest in Italy. When Benito Mussolini's fascist government established \"sabato fascista\" (\"fascist Saturday\"), a mandatory day of sporting and military exercise, baseball was excluded due to its American origins.\nThe arrival of American soldiers in Italy in 1944 changed the situation. Max Otto took the opportunity to relaunch his idea of an Italian league. The first official match played under the authority of \"Lega Italiana Baseball\" and was held on June 27, 1948 in Milan.\nWith the support of the press and powerful partners, particularly Coca-Cola, the debut of this league was a popular success. In Rome, Guido Graziani set up the \" Associazione Italia Baseball\". The two leagues merged in 1950 to create the\" Federazione Italiana Palla Base\", today known as the FIBS (\"Federazione Italiana Baseball Softball\").\nAlessandro Maestri has criticized the development of baseball in Italy in recent years, saying that the shrinking of the Italian Baseball League in 2010, in an effort to professionalize it, would decrease the motivation for young Italian players to develop in the domestic league.\nNational team.\nThe Italian national baseball team is considered amongst the strongest in European Baseball Championship.\nThe Italian baseball team takes part in international competitions, such as European Championships, Olympic Games, World Baseball Classic or the Baseball World Cup in particular. The national team finished fourth in the World Cup in 1974 and 1998, the national team has eight European championship titles between 1954 and 1997."

The Colonials represented Robert Morris University and were coached by Derek Schooley, in his 17th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Canisius' players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nRobert Morris began the season well and continued their strong play for most of the year. The team was buoyed by the addition of two freshman, Randy Hernández and Noah West, who made major contributions to the offense and defense respectively. By mid-January RMU found themselves ranked in the top 20 with an 11–3 record and a chance to make the NCAA Tournament without having to win their conference tournament, a rarity for Atlantic Hockey. Unfortunately, the team was hit by several COVID cancellations and ended up losing 4 of their final 7 games entering the Atlantic Hockey Tournament. It was still possible for the Colonials to make the tournament without an Atlantic Hockey Championship, but any chance the team had was washed away when the offense faltered against Niagara and the team was knocked out in the quarterfinals.\nOn May 26, 2021, it was announced that Robert Morris University would be ending both its men and women's varsity hockey programs, effective immediately.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The team nickname was noted to be the \"Capitals\", as Carson City played the 1907 season as members of the Independent level Nevada State League. The 1907 Carson City team is the only minor league team hosted in Carson City to date.\nHistory.\nOne of the earliest organized baseball clubs was the 1870 Carson City Silver Star ballclub. Another ballclub of the early era was the 1874 Carson City Silver Stars.\nIn 1907, Carson City hosted minor league baseball as the \"Capitals\" became charter members of the Nevada State League, which began minor league play operating as an Independent four–team league. The Nevada State League president was John T. Powers, who later served as president of the Federal League. The 1907 Nevada State League formed with charter franchises in Carson City, Nevada, Goldfield, Nevada, Reno, Nevada and Tonopah, Nevada.\nThe Nevada State League had been structured with John T. Powers serving as league president and Bert Ulmer as treasurer. On July 6, 1907 a meeting was conducted at the office of Senator Boyd, where the Nevada State League Board of Directors was formed. The directors were Ben Rosenthal of Goldfield, Senator James T. Boyd of Reno, J.P Merder of Carson City and Thomas Kendall of Tonopah. Powers had previously served as president of the Wisconsin State League. Ulmer was an owner of the Elite Saloon in Goldfield. James T. Boyd was a member of the Nevada State Senate from 1906 to 1910. Rosenthal was Goldfield County commissioner. Kendall was a mining pioneer, owner of the Kendall Mine and a founder of Toonpah.\nResearch indicates the Carson City franchise was called the Carson City \"Capitals\". The other league members were noted to be called the Goldfield \"Miners\", Reno \"Mudhens\" and Tonopah \"Mollycoddlers\". Unofficial records place Carson City in 2nd place with a 7–4–1 record, behind the 1st place Goldfield \"Miners\", who had a 9–5 record. They were followed by the Tonopah \"Mollycoddlers\" at 3–6 and the Reno \"Mudhens\" with a 3–7–1 record. It is noted that Reno disbanded on July 15, 1907 and it is possible the rest of the league, Carson City included, followed suit, as only three teams would have remained. Carson City, Nevada has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe exact name and location of the Carson City ballpark in 1907 is unknown.\nNotable alumni.\nNo roster information for Carson City in 1907 is known."

The municipal course, rare for Sweden, was built with the help of 13 corporate sponsors. The club was admitted to the Swedish Golf Federation in 1962 and the full 18 hole course was completed in 1965.\nTogether with Royal Drottningholm Golf Club the club hosted the Volvo Open in 1970, where Frenchman Jean Garaïalde ultimately prevailed over Jack Nicklaus by one shot, while The Open champions Bob Charles, Peter Thomson and Kel Nagle trailed further behind. It also hosted the Delsjö Ladies Open and the Gothenburg Ladies Open on the Ladies European Tour in 1985 and 1988. \nKarin Sjödin and Linda Wessberg are two LPGA Tour players that grew up playing at the club, along with European Tour winner Sebastian Söderberg."

        "text": "The Australia cricket team toured Bangladesh in August 2021 to play five Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The matches were used as preparation ahead of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Cricket Australia planned for the series to take place following their tour of the West Indies. It was the first bilateral T20I series between the two teams, and Australia's first tour of Bangladesh since 2017.\nBangladesh won the first T20I match by 23 runs, recording their first ever win in the format against Australia in five attempts. Bangladesh then won the second T20I by five wickets, and the third T20I by ten runs. Therefore, Bangladesh won the series with two matches to spare, and recorded their first ever series win in any format against Australia. Australia won the fourth T20I by three wickets, to avoid a whitewash. However, they lost the final match by 60 runs, with Bangladesh winning the series 4–1.\nBackground.\nAlthough initially Australia were scheduled to play three T20I matches in October 2021, in April 2021, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) asked Cricket Australia to play five T20Is instead of three. In May 2021, both cricket boards agreed to play five T20Is in August 2021, following Australia's tour of the West Indies.\nTo avoid any sort of security or health risks, Cricket Australia requested three conditions of the BCB. Firstly they wanted the Australian players and staff to be taken to the team hotel from the Shahjalal International Airport immediately upon arrival, and secondly they wanted only the Australian players, including the individuals concerned to bio-secure bubble, to remain at the hotel. The BCB also wanted to organise the T20I matches in two venues, Mirpur and Chattagram to prevent the pitch from being hampered. However, Cricket Australia have requested that only one venue should be used for the entire series. The BCB later complied with the request, with all five matches scheduled to be played at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka. On 22 July 2021, the dates for the matches were confirmed. The series was not shown live in Australia due to a lack of a deal with broadcasters. It was the first time since the team's tour of Pakistan in 1994 that an overseas tour was not shown on Australian television.\nSquads.\nOn 27 May 2021, Australia named a 23-man preliminary squad for the tour with Aaron Finch being named as their captain. On 8 June 2021, six more players were added to Australia's preliminary squad, with Australia confirming the final squad on 16 June 2021. Tanveer Sangha and Nathan Ellis were named as reserve players. Ellis was later moved up to Australia's full squad, covering for Riley Meredith. On 25 July 2021, Australia's captain Aaron Finch was ruled out of the tour due to an injury. The next day, Litton Das was ruled out of Bangladesh's squad due to a family matter. On 2 August 2021, Cricket Australia named Matthew Wade as the team captain in Finch's absence."

The schedule for the tour was confirmed in August 2021.\nTom Latham was named as New Zealand's captain, with Kane Williamson being unavailable due to him playing in the rescheduled phase of the 2021 Indian Premier League. A warm-up match for the New Zealand team at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan in Savar was scheduled to take place, but was later cancelled. The New Zealand team arrived in Bangladesh on 24 August 2021.\nBangladesh won the first match of the series by seven wickets, to record their first win against New Zealand in T20I cricket. Bangladesh then won the second T20I by four runs, with New Zealand winning the third match by 52 runs. Bangladesh won the fourth T20I by six wickets to record their first T20I series win against New Zealand. New Zealand won the fifth and final T20I match by 27 runs, with Bangladesh winning the series 3–2.\nSquads.\nUpon the team's arrival in Bangladesh, New Zealand's Finn Allen tested positive for COVID-19. No immediate decision was made regarding the need for a replacement for Allen, with Matt Henry named as cover for Allen three days later. Following the first T20I, Allen returned to the New Zealand bubble, after providing two negative tests."

        "text": "The 2020–21 Biathlon World Cup – Mixed Relay started on 10 January 2021 in Oberhof and will finished on 14 March 2021 in Nové Město\nCompetition format.\nThe relay teams consist of four biathletes. Legs 1 and 2 are skied by either the two men or the two women; legs 3 and 4 are skied by the remaining athletes. The race concists of either four legs or four legs. Every athlete's leg is skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds: one prone and one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually from the spare round holders or from bullets deposited by the athlete into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still standing targets, one penalty loop must be taken for each remaining target. The first-leg participants all start at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five).\nThe single mixed relay involves one male and one female biathlete each completing two legs consisting of one prone and one standing shoot. The starting biathletes all start the race at the same time and complete one leg before exchanging with their partner who completes another leg. The athlete then exchanges back with their partner who completes another leg before exchanging back and completing a final leg, which includes an extra lap after the final shoot. The rules regarding shooting are the same as in the regular mixed relay.\nStandings.\n4 of 6 competitions scored "

The Raiders represent Colgate University in the NCAA's Patriot League.\nColgate began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1900. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Colgate's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Phoenix represent Elon University in the NCAA's Colonial Athletic Association.\nElon began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1911. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Elon's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

It is aimed at top-level undrafted and released players, as well as high-level collegiate and former Volcanoes players seeking to rejoin the MLB affiliated minor league ranks. To not put their collegiate players' eligibility at risk, players will not be paid for the inaugural season, but that is planned to change in the future.\nIn addition to the Volcanoes, the league will feature the Campesinos de Salem-Keizer (previously the Volcanoes' Copa de la Diversión alter-ego) as well as the revival of the Portland Mavericks (an infamous independent Northwest League team which played from 1973 to 1977) and the Salem Senators (a name used by numerous Northwest League teams based in Salem throughout the 20th century)."

He finished his senior season with 41 tackles, four interceptions and four pass break-ups and was named first-team All-Class 8A. He was a four-star recruit, per ESPN.

He suffered a serious injury on the opening kickoff of his first game with the team and missed multiple weeks of his redshirt sophomore season. As a redshirt junior, Robinson recorded 54 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, three interceptions and 10 pass breakups with one forced fumble and was named second-team All-American Athletic Conference (AAC). Robinson was named second-team All-AAC again as a redshirt senior.\nProfessional career.\nRobinson was selected by the New York Giants in the third round (71st overall) of the 2021 NFL Draft.

The Tigers represent the Princeton University and played their home games at the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Despite the issues, Princeton and most of ECAC Hockey were expecting to start playing some time in November. After the teams had assembled and began practicing, however, a sizable number of Yale's players tested positive for coronavirus. On October 16, Yale raised the campus alert status from green to yellow when the 18th member of the men's ice hockey team tested positive. Less than a month later, the Ivy League, Princeton's primary conference, announced that it was cancelling all winter sports for 2020–21. Additionally the schools would not be participating in any Spring sports until the end of February. The announcement was not particularly surprising, considering that, unlike other conference, the Ivy League does not rely on revenue generated from its athletic programs.\nBecause the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Princeton's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required. Because of this, players who would have been members of Princeton for the 2021 season had a pathway to leave the program and immediately play for another university.\nSchedule and Results.\nSeason Cancelled"

The ground is situated south of the village, at the end of School Lane on a field called Crompton Ground. The current 'D.S. King pavilion' (built in 1985) replaced an old RAF Hut constructed in 1961, which in turn replaced their original wooden pavilion which stood on the ground since its construction in 1899. Detail on the early years of the club can be sourced from a history of the club by Harold Walker, in \"Echoes of Stanton\", 1951.\nAfter almost 30 years playing friendlies, the club joined the then 'Central Derbyshire League' in 1974, followed by 20 years of competitive cricket over the county boundary with the South Nottinghamshire Cricket League (1992-2012) before joining the Derbyshire County Cricket League in 2013.\nThe club has two senior teams competing in the Derbyshire County Cricket League.\nClub performance.\nThe Derbyshire County Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 2013.\nThe South Nottinghamshire Cricket League competition results showing the club's position (by Division) between 2005-2012."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Eagles represent Eastern Washington University in the NCAA's Big Sky Conference.\nEastern Washington began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1903. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Eastern Washington's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The England team also returned to the Caribbean in March to play three Test matches. The Test series was the first time that the teams played for the Richards–Botham Trophy. The Test series formed part of the 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship. In October 2021, the schedule for the tour was confirmed, with the T20I matches taking place in January 2022, and the Test matches taking place in March 2022. Despite England losing The Ashes 4–0 in January 2022, Joe Root remained as England's Test captain.\nPrior to the third T20I, England's captain Eoin Morgan ruled himself out of the match after feeling pain in his right quad during the warm-up session. Morgan was later ruled out of the rest of the T20I series, with Moeen Ali leading the team in his absence. The West Indies won the first T20I by nine wickets, with England winning the second match by one run. Rovman Powell scored his first century in a T20I match, as the West Indies won the third T20I by 20 runs. With an all-round performance from Moeen Ali, England won the fourth match by 34 runs to level the series 2–2. thanks to a five-wicket haul and a hat-trick from Jason Holder, the West Indies won the final match by 17 runs to win the series 3–2.\nThe first Test match ended in a draw. England had set the West Indies a target of 286 runs from 71 overs, with England only managing to take four wickets. The second Test was also drawn, with both captains scoring centuries. The West Indies won the third Test by ten wickets, to take the series 1–0. The defeat on the back of losing the Ashes series 4–0 called into question Root's captaincy, with several ex-England Test captains calling for Root to step down. On 15 April 2022, Root resigned as the captain of England's Test side with immediate effect. Root said it has been an honour to captain the side but how much of a toll it has taken on him.\nSquads.\nCricket West Indies named Jayden Seales, Alzarri Joseph and Devon Thomas named as reserves in their T20I squad. Harry Brook was added to England's T20I squad as cover for Sam Billings, after he was called up for the fifth Ashes Test in Hobart. On 8 February 2022, England named their Test squad for the tour, with James Anderson and Stuart Broad both left out. Jofra Archer and Olly Stone both joined up with England's Test squad, training alongside the team after recovering from injuries. On 6 March 2022, England named their twelve-man squad for the first Test, with Ollie Robinson ruled out of the match after suffering a back injury during the warm-up game. England's Mark Wood suffered an elbow injury in the first Test and was ruled out of the rest of the series.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nEngland won the toss and Joe Root chose to bat.

        "title": "History of the International Ice Hockey Federation",
        "text": "The History of the International Ice Hockey Federation which spans over a hundred years, chronicles the evolution of international cooperation in ice hockey. Among major achievements accomplished in that time is the standardization of playing rules and the establishment of tournaments.\n1908–1913.\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation was founded on 15 May 1908 at 34 Rue de Provence in Paris, France, as Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). The founders of the federation were representatives from Belgium, Bohemia, France, Great Britain and Switzerland. Louis Magnus, the French representative, was the fifth member to sign the founding document and also the first president of the LIHG.\nThe second congress was held from 22 to 25 January 1909 in Chamonix, France. Playing and competition rules were established, and an agreement was reached for an annual European Championship to be contested, beginning in 1910. The 1909 Coupe de Chamonix was contested during the congress. It was won by Princes Ice Hockey Club, representing Great Britain. Germany became the sixth LIHG member on 19 September 1909.\nThe third LIHG Congress was held on 9 January 1910 in Montreux, Switzerland. Louis Magnus was re-elected president and Peter Patton took on the position of vice-president. The first European Championship began in Les Avants a day after the conclusion of the congress. It was won by Great Britain.\nRussia was added as the seventh LIHG member and Herman Kleeberg replaced Peter Patton as vice president at the fourth LIHG Congress, which was held in Berlin from 16 to 17 February 1911, in conjunction with the 1911 European Championship. On 14 March 1911, the LIHG adopted Canadian rules of ice hockey.\nThe fifth LIHG Congress took place from 22 to 23 March 1912, in Brussels, Belgium. Unlike the two previous conferences, it was not held in conjunction with the European Championships, which had been staged in Prague in early February. A verdict was reached regarding the fate of the past month's European Championship, which had been the subject of a protest by Germany. It was decided that the tournament would be annulled as Austria was not yet a LIHG member at the time of its playing. Austria, along with Sweden and Luxembourg, were accepted as LIHG members at the congress. Henri van den Bulcke succeeded Louis Magnus as LIHG president, and Max Sillig replaced Herman Kleeberg as vice-president. The first LIHG Championship was contested in Brussels from 20 to 24 March. It was held annually until 1914.\nAt the 1913 congress in St. Moritz, Max Sillig resigned his position as vice-president and was replaced by Peter Patton, who had previously served in the position from 1910 to 1911. In February 1913, LIHG arranged the first European Bandy Championship tournament in Davos, Switzerland.\n1914–1945.\nThe 1914 congress was held in Berlin, the location of that year's European Championship. Louis Magnus replaced Van den Bulcke as president, but he resigned immediately as the other delegates did not follow his program. Peter Patton, vice-president at the time, then became president and had new elections staged. Van den Bulcke was again elected as president (a position he would hold until 1920), and Patton was returned to his prior role of vice-president.\nWorld War I interrupted all activities of the federation between 1914 and 1920. The LIHG expelled Austria and Germany from its ranks following the war in 1920. Bohemia's membership was transferred to the new country of Czechoslovakia the same year.\nThe 1920 Olympics were the first to integrate hockey into their program. Canada and the United States made their debut on the international scene at the tournament. Their level of play was vastly superior to that of the Europeans and Canada took home the gold while the US won the silver medal. On 26 April 1920, at the LIHG Congress which was held during the Olympic tournament, both countries became members of the federation. Also at the congress, Max Sillig became president, and Paul Loicq and Frank Fellowes were elected as vice presidents.\nPaul Loicq was elected as president in 1922. Karel Hartmann and Haddock were chosen as the new vice-presidents.\nAt the 1923 congress it was decided to consider the 1924 Olympic Games as the World Championship as well as to organize a parallel European Championship. Romania, Spain, and Italy were admitted to the LIHG the same year.\nAustria was re-admitted to the LIHG in 1924, while the Swedish proposal to re-admit Germany was declined. The Swedes protested by leaving the LIHG. They returned in 1926 following the re-admission of Germany.\nThe 1928 Winter Olympics, which also served as the World and European Championship for the year, saw a record 11 countries participate as Canada claimed their third gold medal.\nAt the 1929 congress, the LIHG decided to organize a stand-alone World Championship, beginning in 1930. The first World Championship began in Chamonix, but had to be concluded in Vienna and Berlin as the natural ice in Chamonix melted toward the end of the tournament. Canada was considered so dominant that it received a bye to the final, where it easily dispatched Germany to win the gold medal. Japan, which had joined the LIHG just days prior to the start of the tournament, entered a team consisting of medical students.\nThe 1932 Winter Olympics, held in Lake Placid, consisted of only four teams due to the global financial crisis. Germany and Poland were the only European nations present as Canada won their fourth Olympic gold medal. The 1932 European Championship was contested as the last stand-alone European Championship. Nine countries participated and Sweden won their third European title.\nThe LIHG celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1933. Since its foundation in 1908, 18 European Championships, six World Championships, and four Olympic Games tournaments had been contested. The 1933 World Championship marked the first time that Canada failed to emerge victorious in a World Championship or Olympic tournament. They were defeated by the United States, 2–1 in overtime.\nThe Netherlands and Norway became LIHG members in 1935. The three Baltic states, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania joined the LIHG in 1931, 1935, and 1938 respectively. South Africa was accepted into the LIHG in 1937.\nThe 1936 Winter Olympics set a new record with 15 participants. Great Britain, consisting of a team in which nine of the 13 players had grown up in Canada, won their first and only Olympic gold medal at the tournament.\nWorld War II disrupted all LIHG events – World, European, and Olympic tournaments alike – spanning from 1940 to 1946.\nWhile the LIHG is inactive during the war, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association and the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) join to form the International Ice Hockey Association.\n1946–1956.\nThe first LIHG Congress in seven years was held in Brussels on 27 April 1946. Germany and Japan were expelled from the federation, while the memberships of the three Baltic states – Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia – were voided due to their annexation by the Soviet Union. Austria had its membership restored. It had been voided in 1939 following the country's union with Germany. Denmark entered the LIHG as a new member.\nThe first World Championship following the war was held in Prague in February 1947. Despite Canada's absence from the tournament, it received great fan support (especially from the Czechoslovak fans) as Czechoslovakia captured the gold medal. Paul Loicq, who had been the LIHG president for 25 years, resigned his position at the LIHG Congress which was being held simultaneously with the World Championship. He was replaced by Fritz Kraatz. During the 1947 championships, the LIHG agreed to a merger with the International Ice Hockey Association. Under the merger agreement, the LIHG presidency would alternate between North America and Europe every three years, and AHAUS was recognized as the governing body of hockey in the United States.\nThe 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz were the subject of a power struggle between two American federations, the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU; recognized by the International Olympic Committee), and AHAUS which was recognized by the LIHG, both of which had sent teams to the tournament. The IOC initially declared that neither team would be allowed to participate, which led the LIHG to threaten a boycott of the entire ice hockey tournament. The IOC then conceded and allowed the AHAUS team to participate in the tournament and the AAU team to march in the opening ceremony. The AHAUS team was excluded from the final rankings of the Olympic tournament, but not from the World Championship, where they officially finished in fourth place.\nW. G. Hardy replaced Fritz Kraatz as president in 1948. He would hold the position for three years, before being replaced by Kraatz, who began his second term in office as LIHG president. Germany and Japan were re-admitted and the Soviet Union – which would go on to win their first World Championship during their inaugural appearance in 1954 – joined as a new member during his tenure.\nWalter A. Brown was elected LIHG president in 1954, replacing Dr. Fritz Kraatz. Meanwhile, the federation adopted an English name and became the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). East Germany became the IIHF's 25th member in 1956.\nIn its early years, LIHG had also administrated bandy, but since Britain and the continental European countries eventually had ceased playing this sport, it virtually only lived on in the Nordic countries and the Soviet Union. Bandy had been played as a demonstration sport at the Oslo Winter Olympics in 1952, then only played by Finland, Norway and Sweden, and in 1955 these three countries and the Soviet Union founded the International Bandy Federation.\n1957–1974.\nThe Hungarian Revolution of 1956 which had caused Hungary to be occupied by the Soviet Army, led to a boycott of the 1957 World Championships, which were being staged in Moscow. Canada and the United States led the boycott, and were joined by Norway, West Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.\nThe IIHF welcomed several new members between 1960 and 1963. Bulgaria and North Korea joined in 1960 while China and South Korea were accepted into the federation in 1963.\nAt the 1961 World Championship in Switzerland, the West German team – as advised by their federal government – refused to compete against East Germany, as in the event of an East German victory, they would've had to pay respects to the East German flag. The game was awarded to East Germany, 5–0, by virtue of a forfeit. Two years later, at the 1963 World Championship in Stockholm, the East Germans took payback on West Germany. Following a 4–3 defeat to the West Germans, the East German players turned their backs in unison to the West German flag as it was being hoisted.\nThe 1962 World Championship, hosted by the American cities of Colorado Springs and Denver, was boycotted by the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, which led to a further boycott by the other Eastern Bloc countries. At issue was the boycott of the 1957 championships in Moscow by Canada and the United States, and the Americans refusal of East German passports in reaction to the building of the Berlin Wall by East Germany.\nThe lower pools (A, B, and C) were contested annually beginning in 1961 and promotion-and-relegation between the pools started the same year. While the B Pool had been played as early as 1951, it was not held every year due to a frequent shortage of teams, and no promotion-and-relegation took place between it and the top division.\nFor the 1965–66 season, the IIHF created the European Cup, a tournament consisting of the top club teams from around Europe. The competition was originated by Günther Sabetzki, based on the Association football European Cup (now UEFA Champions League). In 1968 the IIHF organized the European U19 Championship, a junior competition for players aged 19 and under. The age limit was later reduced to 18 in 1977.\nThe IIHF saw three different presidents take office between 1957 and 1974. Bunny Ahearne was elected to three separate terms (the first from 1957 to 1960, the second from 1963 to 1966, and the third spanning from 1969 to 1975). Robert Lebel served in office from 1960 to 1963, while William Thayer Tutt was president from 1966 to 1969.\n1975–1989.\nIn 1975, Sabetzki was elected president of the IIHF. He replaced Bunny Ahearne, whose heavy-handed regime had caused him to grow increasingly unpopular toward the end of his presidency. Sabetzki would remain in office for nearly two decades, which were considered up to that point the most successful period for international ice hockey on all fronts.\nSabetzki's greatest achievement was ending the Canadian boycott of the World Championships and Olympic Games. The Canadians had boycotted these tournaments between 1970 and 1976 after the IIHF had refused to allow them to roster professional players at the World Championships from NHL teams that had not qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs. President Sabetzki managed to find a compromise that resulted in the return of Canada to international events beginning in 1977. The pro players whose teams had been eliminated from the playoffs were allowed to compete and in exchange, Canada agreed to participate in the World Championships. They also waived their right to host any World Championships. The creation of the Canada Cup (a competition organized by the NHL in Canada every four years) was also part of the new agreement between the IIHF and North American professional hockey.\nWalter Wasservogel became the first full-time general secretary of the IIHF in 1978, serving in the role until 1986.\nThe first official World Junior Championships for players under 20 years of age was held in 1977. Unofficial tournaments, which were not IIHF-sanctioned and teams were eligible to participate by invitation only, had been contested between 1974 and 1976. It began as a relatively obscure tournament, but soon grew in popularity, particularly in Canada. The most infamous WJC event was the Punch-up in Piestany in 1987, where a bench-clearing brawl between Canada and the Soviet Union resulted in the expulsion of both countries from the tournament.\nTwo new tournaments were introduced by the IIHF during the 1980s. The Asian Oceanic U18 Championship, which was held annually until 2002, was played for the first time in 1984. The first Women's European Championship was contested in 1989. It would be held a total of five times between 1989 and 1996.\nSince 1990.\nThe IIHF continued to grow in numbers during the 1980s and 1990s, both due to political events and the continued growth of hockey worldwide. The dissolution of the Soviet Union saw its membership transferred to Russia, and the addition of four ex-Soviet republics; Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine to the federation. In addition, the memberships of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – all of which had initially joined the IIHF in the 1930s but were expelled following their annexation by the Soviet Union – were renewed. The breakup of Yugoslavia also resulted in an increase in membership. Croatia and Slovenia joined as new members, while the membership of the old Yugoslavia was transferred to FR Yugoslavia (which later became known as Serbia and Montenegro and still later dissolved into the independent republics of Serbia and Montenegro). When Czechoslovakia broke up, its membership rights were transferred to the Czech Republic and Slovakia was admitted as a new member. The influx of new members resulted in the IIHF increasing the size of the Group A tournament. It expanded from 8 teams to 12 in 1992 and from 12 to 16 in 1998.\nThe other new members to join the IIHF during the 1980s and 1990s were: Chinese Taipei (1983), Hong Kong (1983), Brazil (1984), Kuwait (1985), Mexico (1985), Greece (1987), India (1989), Thailand (1989), Israel (1991), Turkey (1991), Iceland (1992), Andorra (1995), Ireland (1996), Singapore (1996), Argentina (1998), Namibia (1998; withdrew from an IIHF membership and was removed entirely in 2017), Armenia (1999), Mongolia (1999), and Portugal (1999).\nIn June 1994, René Fasel was elected the President of the IIHF, succeeding Günther Sabetzki. He has served five consecutive terms as president. His most recent started in 2012 after he was re-elected at the IIHF General Congress in Tokyo, Japan. In March 1995, he helped negotiate an agreement so that NHL players could compete at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.\nThe first Women's World Championship was contested in 1990 in the Canadian capital of Ottawa.\nNumerous other tournaments have been created by the IIHF during the 1990s and 2000s. The IIHF World U18 Championships (1999), the Women's Pacific Rim Championships (played in 1995 and 1996), the Continental Cup (1997; known as the Federation Cup from 1994 to 1996), the European Hockey League (contested from 1996 to 2000), and the Super Cup (contested from 1997 to 2000) were introduced during the 90s. The Euro Ice Hockey Challenge (2001), the European Women's Champions Cup (2004), the Elite Women's Hockey League (2004), the European Champions Cup (contested from 2005 to 2008), the World Women's U18 Championships (2008), the Victoria Cup (played in 2008 and 2009), the Champions Hockey League (operated during the 2008–09 season), and the Challenge Cup of Asia (2008) all were created during the 2000s.\nThe IIHF celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2008. As part of the celebrations, the 2008 World Championship was held in Canada for the first time (the tournament was co-hosted by the cities of Halifax and Quebec City). To commemorate the anniversary, the IIHF Centennial All-Star Team was chosen by votes.\nThe number of members continues to grow. Chile (2000), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2001), Liechtenstein (2001), North Macedonia (2001), the United Arab Emirates (2001), Macau (2005), Malaysia (2006), Moldova (2008), Georgia (2009), Kuwait (2009; had originally joined in 1985, but was expelled in 1992), Morocco (2010), Kyrgyzstan (2011), Jamaica (2012), Qatar (2012), Oman (2014), Turkmenistan (2015), Indonesia (2016), Nepal (2016), the Philippines (2016), Algeria (2019), Colombia (2019), Iran (2019), Lebanon (2019), and Uzbekistan (2019) all have joined since the turn of the millennium.\nNamibia, which was an affiliate member of the IIHF until 2017, withdrew from an IIHF membership due to lack of ice hockey activities in the country.\nThe IIHF received widespread international criticism for holding the 2014 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships in Belarus because of the poor human rights record of the country. Several human rights organisations launched the \"Don’t play with the dictator!\" boycott campaign and there were appeals from the US Congress, German Parliament and the European Parliament. The IIHF again received criticism for planning to partly hold the 2021 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships in Belarus. In January 2021, the IIHF withdrew the 2021 World Championship from Minsk due to safety and security issues during the political unrest, besides the COVID-19 pandemic and decided to solely hold the tournament in Riga, Latvia.\nOn May 23, 2021 civilian Ryanair Flight 4978, which was enroute from Athens to Vilnius, was forced to land in Minsk and a passenger of that flight was detained. In protest, Latvian officials replaced the Belarusian state flag in Riga with the former flag associated with the Belarusian opposition groups, including at the 2021 IIHF World Championship display of flags. This was by order of Mayor of Riga Mārtiņš Staķis and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia Edgars Rinkēvičs. The IIHF issued a statement protesting the replacement of the flag, and IIHF president René Fasel asked the mayor to remove the IIHF name, its flag and its symbols from such sites, or to restore the flag, insisting that the IIHF is an \"apolitical sports organization\". In response, Staķis said he would remove the IIHF flags.\nOn February 28, 2022, the IIHF suspended Russia and Belarus from participation in international play because of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine."

The team was led by Gene Keady and played its home games at Mackey Arena.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Big Ten regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament\nNCAA infractions.\nIn 1997 the NCAA began investigating claims of recruiting infractions by Purdue. The Committee on Infractions alleged that assistant coach and top recruiter Frank Kendrick and Purdue booster Bill Powers arranged for a loan of $4,000 in 1995 to recruit Luther Clay. Clay's understanding was that he did not need to pay back the loan, and records show that no attempt was made to recover it. Additionally, Kendrick arranged for a booster to provide housing and transportation for former Boilermaker Porter Roberts' mother. Both claims are denied by Purdue (in the latter case specifically, that the booster was not a Purdue booster, and therefore allowed to provide services as he saw fit). Furthermore, the committee discovered that Kendrick made 15 calls to Jamaal Davis in 1996 and told him to lie about an improper ride he received during a campus visit. Davis signed with Purdue for the 1997–98 but didn't play his freshman year due to academic ineligibility. He would go on to play 12 games the following year before transferring to Cincinnati in 1999.\nIn 1999 the NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions ruled that Purdue had violated laws involving recruiting, extra benefits, and ethical conduct, as well as several secondary violations in the women's basketball program. As a result, Purdue was to repay approximately $80,000 (reduced from around $900,000) in earnings it received from their 1996 NCAA tournament appearance. Purdue received two years probation and dissociation of 2 representatives of the university athletic interests and Kendrick was banned from off-campus recruiting for a year. The basketball program was to reduce the number of official recruiting visits from 12 to 4 per year for the 1999–2000 and 2000–01 seasons, and lost one scholarship (limiting them to 12 per season) for the 2000–01 and 2001–02 academic years. Kendrick was fined an undisclosed amount and was subject to an NCAA \"show-cause\" requirement for 1 year. Finally, Purdue was forced to forfeit the 24 games in which Luther Clay participated (18 regular season wins) and vacate its 2 NCAA games (1 win and 1 loss). The forfeited games would be recorded as losses for Purdue and wins for their opponent, whereas the vacated games would simply remove the result from Purdue's record with no change to the opponent's. The forfeits were among the steepest at the time. The Big Ten conference allowed Purdue to retain their title as regular season champions despite the change in conference records.\nPurdue maintains that none of Clay's on-court actions affected game outcomes, scoring only 60 points the entire season, including 13 points in 12 conference games. Clay would transfer to Rhode Island after one season with Purdue. Kendrick left the Purdue basketball program in 1999. The Big Ten had multiple basketball scandals around this time, including the University of Michigan basketball scandal and the University of Minnesota basketball scandal."

He made his MLB debut in 2024.\nAmateur career.\nMiller attended De Smet Jesuit High School in Creve Coeur, Missouri. In 2015, his junior year, he went 5–1 with a 3.58 ERA, and as a senior in 2016, he compiled a 3–4 record and 3.14 ERA. He went undrafted in the 2016 Major League Baseball draft after emailing professional scouts that had contacted him and informing them that he would not sign if selected, and would be honoring his commitment to play college baseball at Stanford University.\nIn 2017, as a freshman for the Stanford Cardinal, Miller appeared in 17 games (making 13 starts and four relief appearances) in which he went 5–2 with a 3.65 ERA. After the season, he participated in the New England Collegiate Baseball League with the Newport Gulls.

Over 11 games (seven starts) between the three clubs, he went 1–0 with a 1.50 ERA and 52 strikeouts (13.0 strikeouts per 9 innings) over 36 innings. Miller did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Phillies invited Miller to spring training as a non-roster player in 2021. He began the 2021 season on the injured list, and pitched only innings for the year. He was selected to play in the Arizona Fall League for the Peoria Javelinas after the season. He was assigned to the Reading Fightin Phils of the Double-A Eastern League to begin the 2022 season. He was selected to represent the Phillies at the 2022 All-Star Futures Game. In mid-August, he was promoted to the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the Triple-A International League. Over 32 games (seven starts) between the two teams, he went 1–1 with a 3.54 ERA, 62 strikeouts (11.5 strikeouts per 9 innings), and 31 walks over innings. He threw a fastball that could reach 98 mph, low-80s slider, and changeup.\nOn January 9, 2023, the Phillies traded Miller to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for Yunior Marte. In 54 appearances split between the Double–A Richmond Flying Squirrels and Triple–A Sacramento River Cats, he accumulated a 2.45 ERA with 88 strikeouts and 15 saves across innings pitched.

Gabe Brown led all scorers with 19 on four of 10 shooting from three. Max Christie scored a career-high 18 and Marcus Bingham added 10 points, six blocks, and six rebounds. The Spartans again dominated the glass, outrebounding Butler 41–25. The win moved MSU to 2–1 on the season.\nEastern Michigan.\nThe Spartans next played Eastern Michigan on November 20 in East Lansing. MSU started poorly, trailing early as Izzo stated his team was not properly prepared for the start of the game. As a result, EMU hung around early before MSU pulled away late in the first half to lead by 18 at the break. Marcus Bingham scored 19 points and added 12 rebounds for his first career double-double. Malik Hall, who started for Joey Hauser (minor calf injury), scored 15 while Gabe Brown added 10 as the Spartans pulled away for an 83–59 win.

However, they were able to lead for most of the second half as Malik Hall shot a perfect 9–9 from the floor including one three-pointer and five free throws. Hall's career-high 24 points led all scorers, but the game was tied with 16 seconds left in the second half as MSU took a timeout. On the ensuing play, Tyson Walker found Marcus Bingham wide open for an alley-oop dunk to give MSU the two-point lead with four seconds left. Loyola's last second half-court shot was no good as the Spartans held on for the 63–61 win. Bingham added 11 points, nine rebounds, and seven blocks in the game. The win moved MSU to 4–1 on the season.\nUConn.\nIn the semifinal of the tournament on November 25, MSU took on No. 22-ranked UConn on Thanksgiving Day.

Gabe Brown scored 16 for the Spartans in the game as MSU surrendered the lead and trailed by as many as seven with less than five minutes remaining in the game. However, MSU finished the game on an 9–0 run over the last 1:41 of the game to pull out the 64–60 win. Helped by a questionable late foul call on UConn, MSU only turned the ball over 12 times in the game. Malik Hall, after scoring 24 in the previous game, managed only two points, but Julius Marble scored 15 to move MSU to 5–1 on the season.\nBaylor.\nMoving on to the championship game of the Battle 4 Atlantis and playing their third game in three days, the Spartans took on No. 6-ranked Baylor on November 26.

The loss dropped MSU to 5–2 on the season.\nLouisville.\nThe newly-ranked Spartans (No. 22 in AP and Coaches Poll) returned home to face Louisville in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge on December 1. The Spartans started well, taking an early lead, but turnovers again caused problems for MSU. Louisville was able to keep the game close for most of the first half despite MSU's great defensive effort, limiting the Cardinals to 37% shooting overall and only 16% from three in the first half. In contrast, MSU shot the ball well (48% from the field and 60% from three) and was able to pull away to take a 36–28 lead at halftime. The Cardinals again narrowed the lead early in the second half as MSU turned the ball over 19 times, but the Spartan defense took over while MSU continued to shoot the ball well and pushed the lead to as many as 20. Some late substitutions allowed Louisville to pull within eight with about two minutes remaining, but the Spartans held on for the 73–64 win. MSU shot 46.9% from the field and 55.6% from three. Malik Hall again played well, scoring 15 points, including 3–3 from three, coming off the bench for the first time since the Butler game. Bingham added nine points, 12 rebounds, and three blocks. Max Christie, who had struggled in the Battle 4 Atlantis, rebounded with 11 points while Jaden Akins scored 10 points in only 10 minutes.

The Spartans missed their first four shots before Gabe Brown scored the Spartans first seven points. The Spartans failed to make a three-pointer until 13:16 remained in the first half and were tied at 10.

The Rockets scored the final six points of the first half to narrow MSU's lead to 20 at half time. In the second half, Toledo, who had shot only 26% from the field in the first half, played much better. The Rockets were able to narrow MSU's lead to singled digits on multiple occasions, but MSU's defense did the job limiting Toledo to only 35% (16% from three) shooting in the game as the Spartans held on for the 81–68 win. Max Christie led the Spartans with 14 points while Gabe Brown added 12. Tyson Walker scored his most points as a Spartan, 11, and added six assists. The Spartans were able to limit their turnovers in the game to 12 as they moved to 7–2 on the season. The win also marked Izzo's 650th win at MSU.\nEarly conference games.\nMinnesota.\nMSU, now ranked No. 19 in the AP poll and No. 20 in the Coaches poll, began its conference schedule with two early Big Ten games, first visiting Williams Arena to face undefeated Minnesota. After being blown out by Minnesota in 2020, the Spartans controlled the game from the tip. Malik Hall and Gabe Brown each had 15 points, while Tyson Walker added a season-high 15 as well. MSU led by double figures for most of the first half and only turned the ball over five times in the half while limiting the Gophers 30% shooting (18% from three). The Spartan offense also played well in the half, making six of 11 three-pointers and leading by 13 at the half. In the second half, the Spartans pushed the lead to as many as 20, but late turnovers brought Minnesota closer. However, MSU was able to hold on for the 75–67 win.

MSU was able to limit Penn State to no three-pointers in the half despite shooting 43% from the field.

Max Christie appeared to shake off his recent shooting slump, making 75% of his shots including four of six three-pointers. Tyson Walker notched his first double-double, scoring 10 points and dishing out 10 assists. Walker only turned the ball over once as well and AJ Hoggard also played well, with seven assists and one turnover.

Oakland was able to keep the game close throughout, but never really threatened as the Spartans won 90–78. The win moved MSU to 10–2 on the season.\nHigh Point.\nThe Spartans had another break, this time for eight days, before playing High Point on December 29. The day before the game, Izzo announced that four players, including starters Marcus Bingham and Max Christie, would not be available for the game after testing positive for COVID-19. MSU, newly ranked No. 10 in both polls, started slowly in the game, missing their first eight shots and trailed by one at the half.

Northwestern did not go away however as the game turned into a free throw shooting contest with 36 fouls and 51 free throws attempted by the two teams in the second half. Tyson Walker fouled out for MSU and struggled, failing to score. Bingham added 13 while Christie added 11 as the game was still in doubt until Brown hit a three-pointer with less than a minute remaining to extend the lead to five as the Spartans held on for the road win, 73–67. The win moved MSU to 12–2 on the season and 3–0 in conference play.\nNebraska.\nMSU welcomed Nebraska to Breslin on January 5. Turnovers were again a major concern for the Spartans as they committed 10 in the first 11 minutes of the game. Nebraska also started well, making their first six baskets and shooting 47% from the field in the first half.

MSU was able to cut down on the turnovers later in the game, committing 19 in the game. MSU led 38–34 at the half. The Spartans were led by Gabe Brown offensively and defensively in the game, Izzo said it was perhaps his best defensive effort in a Spartan uniform, as he grabbed four rebounds and four steals. Brown added two blocks and 14 points while Max Christie scored a career-high 21, shooting seven of nine from the field and making all four of his free throws. The Spartans were able to pull away late, limiting the Cornhuskers to 41% from the field in the second half. MSU held on for the 79–67 win to move to 13–2 on the season and 4–0 in conference play.\nMichigan.\nThe Spartans returned to the road to face their rival Michigan on January 8. However, less than eight hours before the game was scheduled to tip and after MSU had already traveled to Ann Arbor, Michigan announced it had more positive COVID-19 tests within its program and that it was unable to play the game. As a result, the game was postponed.\nMinnesota.\nFollowing the postponement of the game against Michigan, the Spartans welcomed Minnesota to Breslin on January 12. MSU started well, building a 10-point lead in the first half behind four of eight three-point shooting and 46% from the field in the half. However, the Spartans failed to score for the final 2:38 of the half and Minnesota was able to narrow the lead to three at the half. In the second half, Minnesota refused to go away. Both Tyson Walker and Marcus Bingham did not play for the final 10-plus minutes as MSU went with a lineup of AJ Hoggard, Max Christie, Gabe Brown, Malik Hall, and Joey Hauser. With MSU leading by five with 2:21 left in the game, the Gophers scored the next five points to tie the game at 69 with 25 seconds remaining. After calling a timeout, the Spartans were unable to get the ball to Brown and Hoggard improvised by going to the basket and slipping the ball to Hauser who scored with 0.1 seconds left on the clock to give the Spartans the 71–69 win. Christie led the Spartans with 16 points while Brown added 13. Walker added 10 points in only 17 minutes in the win. MSU moved to 14–2 on the season and remained undefeated in conference play at 5–0.\nNorthwestern.\nOn January 15, Northwestern came to Breslin for a rematch of their earlier game. The Spartans struggled mightily in the game and trailed late as Northwestern, without their best player, Pete Nance Jr., led by two with less than 10 seconds remaining. A traveling call after rebounding a missed Hall three-pointer that would have given the Spartans the lead, gave the ball to MSU with 0.9 seconds left. An attempted lob by Joey Hauser to Marcus Bingham resulted in a Northwestern foul that sent Bingham to the line with a chance to tie the game. However, he missed the first free throw and Northwestern secured the rebound to hold on for the 64–62 win. The loss was the first for the Spartans in Big Ten play and dropped them to 5–1 and 14–3 on the season.\nWisconsin.\nAfter five days off, the Spartans, having slipped to No. 14 in the AP poll, traveled to face No. 8-ranked Wisconsin on January 21. MSU quickly fell behind 8–0 to the Badgers at Kohl Center. However, MSU recovered quickly to outscore Wisconsin 42–18 for the remainder of the first half as they outshot Wisconsin, shooting 58% from the floor and limited the Badgers to 27%. MSU entered the second half with a 16-point lead, but Wisconsin would not go away, drawing within six points on two occasions, but MSU was able to respond each time to push the lead back to double figures. Malik Hall led the Spartans with 14 points while four other Spartans scored in double figures. AJ Hoggard scored 12 and added eight assists with only one turnover and hit eight of his 10 free throw attempts as MSU held on for the 86–74 win. The Spartans shot 50% from three and 52% overall in the win. The win moved MSU to 15–3 on the season and left them as the sole remaining one-loss team in the Big Ten at 6–1.\nIllinois.\nMSU, now ranked No. 10 in the AP poll, stayed on the road to face No. 24-ranked Illinois, who were without two of their best players, Kofi Cockburn and André Curbelo, on January 25. Despite the Illini being short-handed and MSU's excellent offensive performance in the previous game, MSU shot poorly from the floor. In the first half, MSU made only eight field goals and shot under 30% from the field including one of five from three. As a result, they trailed by 14 at the break and managed only 20 points in the first half. The Spartan offense improved in the second half, but still struggled, managing only 11 baskets and under 40% from the field. They trailed by as many 16 in the half, but narrowed the lead in the final minutes. Illinois did not score for the final 5:32 of the game while MSU had the ball with six seconds remaining, trailing by two. For the second time in three games, the Spartan opponent committed a foul with less than a second left in the game and Malik Hall went to the line with a chance to tie. However, he missed the first free throw and made the second before time ran out as the Spartans lost 56–55. Marcus Bingham Jr. led the Spartans with 13 points, but only one other Spartan, Gabe Brown, scored as many as 10 in the loss. The loss dropped MSU out of first place in the Big Ten and down to 6–2 in the conference and 15–4 overall.\nMichigan.\nThe Spartans returned home to face Michigan on January 29. MSU played well and outshot Michigan in the first half 51% to 36%. But due in part to Michigan outrebounding the Spartans, MSU only led by four at the break. An early run in the second half by the Spartans extended the lead to as many as 20 as MSU dominated the game. Michigan was limited to only 37% from the field and 18% from three while MSU shot 55% from the field and 50% from three. Max Christie scored 14 of his team-high 16 points in the first half while Joey Hauser added 14 and Malik Hall scored 15. AJ Hoggard notched his first career double-double, 11 points and 10 assists, as MSU won easily 83–67. Football player walk-ons Maliq Carr and Keon Coleman saw action at the end of the game with Coleman scoring a basket in the win. This led the student section to chant, \"just like football,\" referencing the football team's win over Michigan in October. Coleman became the first player to score a touchdown and a basket for AP top ten teams in both football and basketball since 1992 when Florida State's Charlie Ward quarterback/guard did so. Izzo was extremely pleased with his team's effort as the Spartans moved to 16–4 and 7–2 on the season.\nMaryland.\nThe Spartans, ranked No. 13 in the country, returned to the road to face Maryland on February 1. MSU played fairly well in the first half against the Terrapins, limiting their turnovers and pulling away for a 10-point lead at the break. As the second half began, the Spartans extended the lead to 15 points and the rout appeared to be on for MSU. However, the Spartan offense began to struggle and the Terrapins climbed back in to the game, narrowing the lead to single digits several times. With 6:30 remaining in the game, Maryland had narrowed the lead to three and the Spartans went scoreless for the next three minutes. Maryland was finally able to tie the game at 61 with 2:49 left. Following free throws by Malik Hall, Maryland again tied the game, this time at 63 with 2:20 remaining. With 24 seconds left, Tyson Walker forced a turnover, giving MSU the ball with a chance to win the game. After a timeout, with 11 seconds remaining, Hall got the ball from Tyson Walker and made a tough layup with 1.9 seconds remaining to give MSU the 65–63 lead. Maryland's desperation three from half court was no good as MSU pulled out the tight two-point win. The Spartans again moved into a tie for first place in the Big Ten with an 8–2 record while moving to 17–4 on the season.\nRutgers.\nMSU stayed on the road to face Rutgers on February 5 at Jersey Mike's Arena. Rutgers started well, shooting over 60% from the field and leading throughout the first half. However, the Spartans stayed close behind Gabe Brown's hot shooting. Brown, who scored 20 points for the Spartans on six of seven shooting from three, led MSU and kept the game within two points at the half. However, Rutgers continued its hot shooting in the second half and the Spartans could not keep up as they were blown out 84–63. The Scarlet Knights shot 61% from the field in the game and dominated the paint, outscoring MSU 38–16 inside the lane. Rutgers also outrebounded MSU 31–20 in the easy win for the Knights. Izzo described the game \"as an old-fashioned butt-kicking.\" The loss dropped MSU into fourth place in the conference at 8–3 and 17–5 overall.\nWisconsin.\nOn February 8, the now 17th-ranked Spartans returned home to face a Wisconsin team, now ranked No. 14 in the country, they had beaten easily less than two weeks prior. MSU continued its streak of poor starts, falling behind early to the Badgers and trailing throughout the game. MSU only made eight of 25 shots and failed to make a three point basket in the first half. Despite their poor play, they were able to keep the game close, trailing by six at the half, 29–23. In the second half, the Badges pushed the lead to as many as 10, but MSU began to hit shots and cut the Wisconsin lead to within a possession on several occasions, but could not draw any closer. MSU shot much better in the half, hitting 50% of their shots and making three three-pointers, but it was not enough as they lost 70–62. Malik Hall scored 12 points on only seven shots, but still only played 23 minutes in the game. Marcus Bingham led the Spartans with 15 points in 20 minutes, but the point guard play was poor, with Tyson Walker and AJ Hoggard combining for only eight points and turning the ball over five times. Izzo blamed himself for not having his team prepared. The loss dropped the Spartans to 8–4 in league play and 17–6 overall.\nIndiana.\nMSU next played Indiana at home on February 12. The Spartans started the game well, shooting over 40% from the field, but the Hoosiers attempted 13 more shots in the half, keeping the game close. MSU kept the lead by making 16 of 18 free throws in the half and led by seven at the break. In the second half, the Spartans again shot over 40% from the field and made nine of 10 free throws. Malik Hall led the Spartans with 18 points, including a shot from behind the backboard, as the Spartans led by as many as 18 in the half. Both point guards played well for the Spartans as Tyson Walker scored 15 while AJ Hoggard added 14 points and eight assists. Hoggard was ejected in the game for two technical fouls, but it didn't matter as MSU held on for the 76–61 win. Izzo said the game wasn't pretty, but his team was gritty in the win. The win kept MSU a game and a half behind league-leading Illinois at 9–4 and 18–6 overall.\nPenn State.\nAfter slipping to No. 19 in the AP poll, the Spartans returned to the road to face Penn State on February 15. The Spartans shot the ball well in the first half and limited the Nittany Lions to 27% shooting in the first half, but due in part to seven offensive rebounds by PSU, the game was tied at 24 at the half. In the prior game between the two teams, MSU had scored more than 30 fast break points, but Penn State limited the Spartans to only three in the rematch. Despite that, the Spartans surged to a 14-point lead early in the second half and looked to have the game under control with just over 13 minutes left in the game. However, the Spartans scored only 15 points in the final 13 minutes. Penn State slowly cut into the lead and took the lead with 1:37 left on the game. A turnover led to an offensive rebound and three-point play by PSU big man John Harrar with 35 seconds left put the Penn State lead at four. The Lions made their free throws at the end to hold on for the 62–58 win. The loss likely signaled the end of the Spartans' hopes to challenge for a Big Ten championship as they fell to 18–7, 9–5 on the season. After the game, Izzo did not make any players available to the media for the first time any media member could remember.\nIllinois.\nIllinois visited Breslin on February 19. The Illini led throughout, pushing the lead to as many as 16 several times in the second half. MSU played well defensively in the first half, limiting Illinois to under 38% from the field, but Illinois did make five three-pointers in the half and took a 12-point lead to halftime. In the first half, the Spartan offense struggled mightily, shooting only 31% from the field. In the second half, MSU shot the ball much better from the field, shooting over 60% and making six three-pointers. However, behind Kofi Cockburn's 27 points and Jacob Grandison's 24 points, Illinois controlled the game and led by 16 with less than nine minutes remaining. Gabe Brown, Max Christie, and Malik Hall struggled in the game, combining for only eight points. As a result, MSU went with Tyson Walker and AJ Hoggard on the floor at the same time for long periods of time. Walker responded by scoring a season-high 26 points, making 10 of 12 shots including all three three-pointers he attempted. Walker took over in the final five minutes of the game and brought MSU to within two on several occasions. Trailing by two following a three-point play by Walker, Illini guard Trent Frasier hit a long three-pointer with 23 seconds left to give the Illinois a five-point lead and the eventual win 79–74. The loss dropped MSU to 18–8 and 9–6 on the season.\nIowa.\nAfter dropping out of the rankings of the AP poll, the Spartans traveled to Carver–Hawkeye Arena to face No. 25-ranked Iowa on February 22. MSU trailed from the outset as the Hawkeyes routed the Spartans, leading by as many as 30 in the second half and winning by 26. Gabe Brown continued to struggle for the MSU, failing to score and missing all seven of his shots from the field. Max Christie also continued to struggle, making only two of his 11 and shots and play a season-low 24 minutes. Malik Hall led the Spartans with 17 points, but no other MSU player scored in double figures. Izzo vowed to make changes after the game and stated that the team would not give up on the season. The loss was MSU's fifth loss in the previous six games and seventh loss in the prior 11 games. MSU dropped to 18–9 and 9–7 on the season.\nPurdue.\nThe Spartans returned home to face No. 4-ranked Purdue on February 26. MSU started well, taking an early lead and led for most of the first half. MSU changed up its starting lineup, inserting Julies Marble II and Malik Hall into the lineup. The Spartan defense chose not to double team 7'4\" Purdue center Zach Edey in order to limit the Boilermakers' three-point shooting. As a result, Edey scored 25 points in the game, but Purdue only made one three-pointer. MSU led by as many as seven in the first half and led at the half 35–33. MSU was outshot (PU 52.1%, MSU 47.4%), outrebounded (PU 34, MSU 24), and lost the free throw battle (PU 14–19, MSU 5–10). However, the Spartans still played well, leading throughout most of the second half as well. With an 11-point lead and 9:36 remaining, Purdue countered to tie the game with 51 seconds remaining. Marble made two free throws to give MSU a two-point lead, but Trevion Williams tied the game again with 30 seconds remaining. Following an MSU timeout, the Spartans put the ball in Tyson Walker's hands and, following a screen that left Williams on Walker, Walker hit a three-pointer with 1.1 seconds remaining to give the Spartans the 68–65 win. Gabe Brown played well for the Spartans, leading MSU with 13 points while Marble added 12. Max Christie and AJ Hoggard each had 11 while Walker scored eight. The win marked Izzo's 662nd win as coach as MSU, tying him with Bob Knight for the most wins by a men's basketball coach at a Big Ten school. The win moved MSU to 19–9 and 10–7 on the season.\nMichigan.\nThe Spartans traveled to face rival Michigan on March 1 in a makeup game of the prior scheduled game that was postponed to COVID-19 protocols at Michigan. Michigan outplayed MSU from the start, shooting over 60% from the field in the first half while making five three-pointers. UM big man Hunter Dickinson torched MSU's interior defense and scored a career-high 33 points as the Wolverines took the early lead and never relinquished it. The Spartans trailed by as many as 20 in the game. Spartan guard AJ Hoggard was limited in the game due to a \"non-COVID illness\" and played only 11 minutes. MSU was no match in the game as they continued to be inconsistent on the season, getting blown out 87–70. Izzo was disappointed in his team and called out his juniors and seniors for lacking leadership. The loss dropped MSU to 19–10, 10–8 on the season with two games remaining. In the game, Marcus Bingham Jr. set the record for career blocks at MSU, passing former teammate Xavier Tillman.\nOhio State.\nTwo days later, the Spartans traveled to face No. 23 Ohio State in Columbus for their final road game of the season. Once again, MSU started slow, falling behind 13–0 in the first three minutes. The Spartans were able to narrow the lead to two points with 8:48 left in the half and looked to make the game close. However, the Buckeyes responded with a 9–0 run to put the game out of reach. MSU's defense struggled again, allowing OSU to make 54% of their shots including eight of 13 three-pointers in the first half. OSU, without two key players, dominated MSU from the inside. MSU shot the ball well from three in the game, making nine of 18 threes, but could not narrow the lead to single digits as they lost their fifth game in the prior six and dropped to 19–11 and 10–9 on the season. Izzo expressed he was angry with his team's performance and commented that they looked like a poorly-coached team.\nMaryland.\nFollowing their game at Ohio State, MSU returned home for the season finale against Maryland on March 6. MSU started well, scoring the first 14 points of the game leading 18–1 with 12 minutes remaining in the first half. The Spartans led by as many as 22 points in the first half and led by 20 at halftime. Maryland shot 28% from the field in the first half and made only one thee while MSU shot over 53% from the field in the half. The Terrapins started the second half on a 10–0 run to narrow the lead to 10. MSU responded, but Maryland stayed close, pulling within three seven minutes left in the game. The Spartans steadied their play, led by Malik Halls 17 points and Marcus Bingham's 11 rebounds to hold on for the 77–67 win. The win marked Izzo's 663rd win as coach of the Spartans, the most by a men's basketball coach at a Big Ten school. The win marked MSU's 20th on the season, the 21st time under Izzo the Spartans had won at least 20 games. The win ended the regular season with the Spartans 20–11, 11–9 in Big Ten play.\nPostseason.\nBig Ten tournament.\nThe Big Ten tournament took place at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis from March 9 through March 13. MSU finished the season in a tie for seventh place with rival Michigan, but were the No. 7 seed in the Big Ten tournament.\nMaryland.\nThe Spartans faced Maryland for the second consecutive game in the second round of the Big Ten tournament on March 10. The game proceeded as the prior two meetings between the teams did with MSU playing well from the outset and leading by nine at half. In the second half, as they did in the second meeting, MSU pushed the lead to as many as 20 points and looked to have an easy win. However, the Spartans began to turn the ball over and quickly surrendered the large lead. Maryland began to press the Spartans and MSU turned the ball over six times in their final 11 possessions. The Terrapins narrowed the lead to two with just over a minute remaining in the game. A basket by Tyson Walker moved the lead to four and Max Christie hit two free throws to extend the lead to six with 31 second left. Maryland drew within four on their next possession and forced an MSU turnover. A Maryland basket with 16 seconds left moved the lead at two. On the ensuing inbound play, MSU turned the ball over and Maryland had the ball with a chance to tie or win. However, Maryland guard Fatts Russell missed a three-pointer to take the lead with six seconds remaining and Christie made two free throws to put the game out of reach as the Spartans held on for the 76–72 win. The win moved MSU to 21–11 on the season.\nWisconsin.\nMSU faced Wisconsin on March 11 in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament. After splitting the season series against the Badgers in the regular season, offense was at a premium in the first half as both teams shot under 35% from the field and neither made a three-pointer. MSU held the lead at the half 24–22. As the offenses played better in the second half, MSU only made one three-pointer, but Marcus Bingham Jr. and Tyson Walker hit big shots down the stretch for the Spartans as MSU held Wisconsin star Johnny Davis to only 11 points in the game. Bingham scored 19 and added 11 rebounds while Walker scored 11 with seven assists. MSU only made one three-pointer in the game, but held on for the six-point win. The win moved MSU to 22–11 on the season.\nPurdue.\nIn the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament on March 12, the Spartans faced No. 3-seeded Purdue. Both offenses struggled again in the first half, again both shooting under 35% from the field. Despite this, MSU trailed by seven at the half, 27–20. In the second half, both offenses again shot the ball better. Tyson Walker, who left the game with an injured ankle early in the first half, did not play in the second half. Purdue led by as many as 11 in the second half, but MSU managed to stay in the game, narrowing the lead to one with over five minute remaining. However, the Boilermakers hit some big shots down the stretch to hold on for the 75–70 win. A.J. Hoggard, who played all 20 minutes in the second half without Walker, scored 17 points and added 10 assists in the loss while Gabe Brown contributed 16 points. The loss dropped MSU to 22–12 on the season as they waited to see where they would play in the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA Tournament.\nMSU received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament as the No. 7 seed in the West region.\nDavidson.\nThe Spartans faced Davidson and former guard Foster Loyer in the first round of the NCAA tournament on March 18. Loyer played three years at MSU before transferring prior to the season. The game remained close throughout the first half as both teams shot over 40% from the field. Joey Hauser had his best game of the season, making four of six three-pointers and nine of 12 overall while scoring a season-high 27 points for the Spartans. However, Davidson kept it close until MSU was able to push the lead to eight with less than a minute remaining. The Wildcats hit a flurry of three-pointers in the final seconds to draw within one with less than one second remaining. But, MSU was able to hold on for the 74–73 win. Hauser added eight rebounds to his 27 points while AJ Hoggard scored 13 and Gabe Brown added 12. Marcus Bingham added eight rebounds in the win, moving MSU to the Second Round of the Tournament. The win moved MSU to 23–12 on the season.\nDuke.\nThe Spartans next faced Duke, whose head coach Mike Krzyzewski was in his final season coaching the Blue Devils. MSU started well behind Gabe Brown's 18 points and kept within a few possessions of the Blue Devils throughout the first half. The Spartans did so by hitting seven of 10 three-pointers in the half and trailed by four at the break. In the second half, the Spartans again kept it close, but only made four of 12 three-pointers. However, following free throws by Marcus Bingham with 5:10 remaining, the Spartans moved to a 70–65 lead. Duke responded, finishing the game on a 20–6 run to pull out the nine-point victory 85–76. Bingham, in his last game as a Spartan, scored 16 and added 10 rebounds. The loss ended MSU's season with a record of 23–13.\nRoster.\nOn September 28, 2021, Izzo announced that Gabe Brown and Malik Hall had been selected captains. Izzo said they were near-unanimous selections as the team's captains.\nAt the MSU media day on October 20, Izzo announced that walk-on Davis Smith, son of former Spartan player Steve Smith, was given a scholarship. Izzo said that he had not been given the scholarship because of who his father was; that he had earned it.\nIn early October, Izzo stated that he was still open to Maliq Carr and Keon Coleman, both on the MSU football team, to joining the team. However, he encouraged them to help \"take care of football business\" prior to doing so. In January 2022, Izzo stated that it was still uncertain whether Coleman and Carr would join the team following the football season's end. He stated that he and football coach Mel Tucker would make the decision together. Both Carr and Coleman suited up and were available for the game against Northwestern on January 15.\n \nSchedule and results.\nOn September 8, 2021, the Big Ten announced the conference schedule. \n!colspan=9 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=|Regular season\n \n \n \n \n \n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\nPlayer statistics.\nSource"

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Missouri State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

The 37th America's Cup will be raced from 12 October 2024 as a first-to-seven-wins match-race series in Barcelona, Spain, between a yacht representing the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron and a yacht representing the yacht club that wins the Louis Vuitton Challenger Selections Series, also in Barcelona, in September 2024.\nThe Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron is again the defender of the America's Cup after its yacht \"Te Rehutai\", owned and sailed by the Emirates Team New Zealand syndicate, was the successful defender in the 36th America's Cup, beating the challenger Luna Rossa, representing Circolo della Vela Sicilia, 7–3 in a first-to-seven series raced from 10 to 17 March 2021 in the Waitemata Harbour and Hauraki Gulf off Auckland, New Zealand.\nImmediately after \"Te Rehutai\" achieved its seventh win in the 36th America's Cup, the Chairman of Royal Yacht Squadron Racing, Bertie Bicket, issued a pre-arranged, \"friendly\" challenge to the Commodore of the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, Aaron Young. This made Royal Yacht Squadron Racing Ltd the Challenger of Record for the next America's Cup.\nThe Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron was founded in 1871 as the Auckland Yacht Club and took its current name in 1902 after receiving a warrant in the name of King Edward VII. Royal Yacht Squadron Racing was founded in 2014 and is an affiliated member of the Royal Yacht Squadron.\nHistory.\nThe America's Cup is a highly prestigious event, being the oldest continuous competition in international sport, and the fourth oldest continuous sporting trophy of any kind. As of 31 March 2021, a total of 36 cup matches have been held. With 25 matches the New York Yacht Club has won the most titles so far.\nThe 36th match from 10 to 17 March 2021 was the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron's fourth America's Cup victory, following its wins in 1995, 2000 and 2017, making it the most successful club in the competition's history except for the New York Yacht Club. The 2021 win also made the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron the only club to have twice successfully challenged for and then defended the America's Cup.\nTerms of Challenge.\nBackground.\nThe challenge by Royal Yacht Squadron to the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron was made on board the 110 foot luxury sailing yacht \"Imagine\" immediately following the completion of the 10th and final race of the 36th America's Cup on 17 March 2021.\nThe challenge was a pre-arranged \"friendly\" challenge arranged by the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron and Royal Yacht Squadron Racing Ltd and their respective sailing teams Team New Zealand and Ineos Team UK. The fact of the challenge and some details were made public on 19 March 2021. Both the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron and Royal Yacht Squadron Racing Ltd consider the challenge to be valid.\nTerms of RYS Challenge.\nThe full text and terms of the challenge have not been made public, but a number of areas of agreement have been revealed in media statements by the \nRoyal Yacht Squadron and Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron and their sailing teams, and in subsequent public comments. Royal Yacht Squadron Racing Ltd and Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron said they would negotiate and issue a protocol to govern the 37th America's Cup by 19 November 2021, eight months after they revealed initial information about the challenge.\nYacht Class.\nIt has been agreed the America's Cup 75 (AC75), a foiling monohull class developed and used for the first time for the 36th America's Cup shall remain the class of yacht for the 37th America's Cup. Royal Yacht Squadron Racing Ltd and Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron also intend that the AC75 class should be used for the 38th America's Cup, and say that agreement to this will be a condition of entry for any other complying clubs wishing to enter any challenger series for the 37th America's Cup.\nFor the first two preliminary regattas as well as the Youth &amp; Women's Americas Cup the AC75 derived AC40 one design class is used. Additionally, the competing teams are allowed to develop 40 foot test boats called LEQ12.\nNationality Rules.\nIt has been agreed a new crew nationality rule will require 100% of race crews to either be a passport holder of the country the team's yacht club as at 19 March 2021 or to have been physically present in that country (or, acting on behalf of such a yacht club in Auckland, the venue of the 36th America's Cup Events) for two of the previous three years prior to 18 March 2021. There will be a discretionary provision allowing a quota of non-nationals on the race crew for competitors from \"emerging nations\", although this term and the size of the quota is yet to be defined.\nCost Reduction Programme.\nTo reduce costs, it has been agreed teams will be restricted to building only one new AC75 for the 37th America's Cup. In addition, Royal Yacht Squadron Racing Ltd and Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron have committed to \"investigating and agreeing a meaningful package of campaign cost reduction measures including measures to attract a higher number of challengers and to assist with the establishment of new teams\".\nVenue.\nRoyal Yacht Squadron and Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron planned to announce the venue for the 37th America's Cup by 19 September 2021. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her Government wanted to see the cup defended in Auckland in 2023, and announced the availability of Government funding to assist Team New Zealand to stay together, subject to a number of conditions, including an expectation the Cup will be defended in New Zealand.\nHowever, on 29 March 2022, Barcelona was announced as the host of the 2024 America's Cup. Barcelona's bid saw an unprecedented alliance across public and private entities working together to attract the America's Cup to Barcelona which included the Government of Catalonia, Barcelona City Council, City Hall of Barcelona, Port of Barcelona, Barcelona Global's investment agency and Barcelona &amp; Partners. Of the previous 36 cup matches, 33 have been held in the defender's home waters. The Deed of Gift provides for the defender to name the venue if they and the Challenger of Record cannot reach agreement.\nDates.\nThe 37th America's Cup will be raced in Barcelona as a first-to-seven-wins series from 12 October 2024. It is expected to be completed on or before 21 October 2024. This complies with the deed which requires the match to be held in summer or summer-shoulder months. In the southern hemisphere, this is defined as between 1 November and 30 April. In the northern hemisphere, it is defined as between 1 May and 31 October.\nEvent management.\nRoyal Yacht Squadron and Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron announced a to establish a single Event Authority responsible for the conduct of all racing and the management of commercial activities relating to the 37th America's Cup. Therefore, 'ACE (America's Cup Event) Barcelona S.L.' was created as the sole Event Authority for the 37th America's Cup in Barcelona and is exclusively responsible for the planning, management and delivery of a successful event.\nChallengers.\nThe Royal Yacht Squadron is the Challenger of Record for the 37th America's Cup. Their team, INEOS Britannia, previously lost to Emirates Team New Zealand in the 2017 Louis Vuitton Cup semi-finals, and Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli in the 2021 Prada Cup final. The Royal Yacht Squadron's challenge will be the first time a British team has competed in three consecutive America's Cup cycles since 1930.\nCircolo della Vela Sicilia, represented by Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, have indicated their interest in returning for the 37th America's Cup. Luna Rossa previously lost to Emirates Team New Zealand in the 2021 America's Cup final. In a statement, the team said that they looked \"forward to returning to racing on the AC75s in the next edition of the America's Cup\".\nThe New York Yacht Club (NYYC) had indicated interest in returning for the 37th America's Cup. American Magic previously lost to Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli in the 2021 Prada Cup semi-final. The NYYC submitted a challenge to the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron on May 6, 2021, alongside an Evolutionary Draft Protocol for the 37th America's Cup. The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron released a statement in response, where they said they were \"delighted to hear that the New York Yacht Club\" were interested, but questioned, \"their motives for such a presumptuous statement when entries [did not] open for some time.\" The Royal Yacht Squadron and Ineos Team UK also released a statement in response to the New York Yacht Club's challenge, stating that they were \"working collaboratively with the Royal Yacht Squadron and Team New Zealand\".\nThe NYYC had dropped American Magic and announced a tentative partnership with Stars &amp; Stripes, then announced they would no longer pursue the 37th Americas Cup, and then on 7 January opted back in with American Magic.\nIn December 2021 Alinghi founder Ernesto Bertarelli and two-time Olympic champion Hans Peter Steinacher announced the launch of the new Alinghi Red Bull Racing challenge. Bertarelli will continue to represent the Société Nautique de Genève, the yacht club that won the 2003 Louis Vuitton Cup, the 2003 America's Cup, and the 2007 America's Cup.\nOn 3 January 2023, the organisers of the 37th America's Cup announced that K-Challenge Racing would challenge for the 37th America's Cup, after previously challenging for the 32nd America's Cup in 2007. Led by Stephane Kandler and Bruno Dubois, the team, named Orient Express Team, will represent the Société Nautique de Saint-Tropez.\nPreliminary Regattas.\nThe first two preliminary regattas have been raced in AC40 one design yachts. The third preliminary regatta in Barcelona will see the new AC75 yachts, that will also compete in the challenger series and the America's cup."

        "text": "The men's overall in the 2021 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of 35 events in 5 disciplines: downhill, Super-G, giant slalom, slalom, and parallel. The sixth discipline, Alpine combined, had all three of its events in the 2020–21 season cancelled. The tentative season schedule contained 43 events (plus two team parallel events, including one at the season finals), but the final schedule cut the season back to 38 events (and one team parallel event at the season finals). The continuing danger of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the three Alpine combineds (Bormio, Wengen, Bansko) to be canceled in order to keep the speed skiers and the technical skiers separated during the season; additionally, two of the three parallels (Alta Badia, Chamonix) and the second team parallel (Lech/Zürs) were canceled so that other events could take their place and reduce travel. Ultimately, only three of those final 38 races were canceled -- two downhills and a Super-G -- and two of those were canceled by snowstorms during World Cup finals week, as discussed below.\nIn the next-to-last event during the season finals, French skier Alexis Pinturault clinched the overall season championship and the crystal globe that goes with it.\nIn addition to the disruption resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the season was interrupted by the 2021 World Ski Championships, which were held from 8–21 February in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\nThe last four events of the season were scheduled to take place at the final, Wednesday, 17 March through Sunday, 21 March in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. Only the top 25 in each specific discipline for the season and the winner of the Junior World Championship are eligible to compete in the final, with the exception that athletes who have scored at least 500 points in the overall classification are eligible to participate in any discipline, regardless of standing in that discipline for the season. However, on 17 March, the downhill final had to be cancelled after three days of heavy snowfall. On 18 March, the Super-G final was also cancelled, eliminating events in which runner-up Marco Odermatt of Switzerland had a perceived edge over Pinturault. When Pinturault won the giant slalom held on 20 March, he gained an insurmountable lead over Odermatt."

The tour was scheduled to consist of three 50-over matches and three Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is). The tour immediately followed Pakistan's tour of South Africa. Zimbabwe's last international fixtures were in May 2019, in the 2019 ICC Women's Qualifier Africa tournament. In late January 2021, Zimbabwe's Sports and Recreation Commission gave its approval for the tour to take place.\nAt the time of the tour, Zimbabwe did not have Women's One Day International (WODI) status, so the 50-over matches were not classed as such. Ahead of the tour Zimbabwe's coach, Adam Chifo, said that one of the aims would be for the team to eventually gain WODI status. On 5 February 2021, the Pakistan team arrived in Harare for their first ever tour of the country.\nPakistan won the first 50-over match, beating Zimbabwe by 178 runs. However, on 11 February 2021, the tour was ended abruptly. Commencing on 13 February 2021, Emirates Airlines introduced new travel policies on flights from Harare to Pakistan, resulting in the Pakistan team flying home ahead of the new restrictions."

        "title": "Australian Women's Cricket Championships",
        "text": "The Australian Women's Cricket Championships was a women's cricket competition which ran from 1931 until 1996. It usually operated as a first-class competition, with matches played over two days. Later editions included limited overs cricket instead of, or alongside, two-day matches.\nFor the most part, the competition was held annually within a two-week timeframe and contested primarily by teams from the six states of Australia plus the ACT. Player performance at each tournament was used as a guide to determining Australian team selection for future international fixtures. It was the country's first formalised interstate women's cricket competition, with teams having previously only played one-off and friendly matches. Victoria was the most successful team, winning a total of 36 titles. The tournament was replaced in 1996–97 by the Women's National Cricket League.\nHistory.\n1931–1940: Pre-War years.\nThe inaugural edition of the Australian Women's Cricket Championships took place from 21 to 25 March 1931, involving New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. Matches were played with two innings per team in a single day and are not considered to have first-class status. The first match, between New South Wales and Victoria, was abandoned without a ball bowled. New South Wales and Victoria then both won their respective matches against Queensland. A second match was played between New South Wales and Victoria, resulting in victory for the former. Records kept by Women's Cricket Australia—the national governing body for the female branch of the sport until its merger with the Australian Cricket Board in 2003—indicate New South Wales were crowned as champions.\nMatches were extended to two days for the 1933–34 tournament and were considered to have first-class status for the first time. South Australia joined in 1934–35, taking the number of teams up to four, and made their second appearance in 1936–37 which coincided with the debut of Western Australia.\n1947–1972: Guest teams.\nAfter a hiatus caused by World War II, the tournament resumed in 1946–47 which saw Victoria defeat New South Wales in the final. South Australia won their first title in 1951–52. In 1956–57, New Zealand made a one-off appearance, while Queensland and South Australia fielded a combined team. For the 1959–60 tournament, New Zealand domestic team Auckland and a Victoria Second XI made sole appearances, while Queensland and South Australia—for the second and last time—once again fielded a combined team. In 1960–61, Queensland and Western Australia fielded a combined team for the first and only time. In 1962–63, Canterbury featured for a single occasion, while in 1967–68 fellow New Zealand domestic team Otago also made a one-off appearance.\n1973–1978: Single-innings matches added.\nFollowing the introduction of One Day International cricket, the 1972–73 season saw the addition of single-innings matches to the competition for the first time. The tournament, which was won by Victoria, used a 60-overs-per-side format for all games as preparation for the inaugural Women's Cricket World Cup. The next three editions reverted to two-day first-class matches, before the 1976–77 tournament was once again played as a limited overs competition ahead of the second Women's Cricket World Cup.\n1978–1990: Expansion.\nAustralian Capital Territory joined the competition in 1978–79 and Tasmania made their first appearance in 1985–86. Matches from 1978–79 to 1989–90 were held over two days with the exceptions of 1981–82 and 1987–88, when they played as 60-over affairs as preparation for upcoming World Cup tournaments. The number of matches increased during this period, with each team playing as many as 12 matches in 1987–88. Western Australia won their first title in 1986–87.\n1990–1996: Hybrid format, WNCL succession.\nThe 1990–91 tournament introduced a hybrid format whereby group stage games were played as 60-over matches, followed by a finals series with matches played over two days. From 1991–92, 50-over matches were played instead of 60-over matches. The hybrid format lasted for five seasons.\nThe 1995–96 tournament was the final edition of the Australian Women's Cricket Championships. It was played as a 50-over competition with no two-day matches. Victoria won the tournament, beating New South Wales in the final by ten runs. The competition was succeeded by the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) which took place for the first time in 1996–97. The introduction of the WNCL meant the country's top domestic competition would change from a two-week tournament to a fully-fledged national league in which games would be played on a home-and-away basis across the course of a season. Women's cricket in Australia has since undergone a highly successful transformative phase, especially with regards to the sport's rising level of professionalism among its elite female players.\nTeams.\nSource:"

Going into the finals, only Marco Odermatt of Switzerland retained a slim mathematical chance of surpassing Kriechmayr. The final was scheduled for Thursday, 18 March in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. Only the top 25 of the specific ranking and the winner of the Junior World Championship were eligible, except that athletes who have scored at least 500 points in the overall classification could participate in all specialties. However, a continuation of the heavy snow and bad weather that had forced the cancellation of the downhill final the day before also forced cancellation of the Super-G final, ending Odermatt's chances and giving Kriechmayr the crystal globe.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2021 World Ski Championships, which were held from 8–21 February in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. The men's super-G was scheduled for 9 February but was postponed due to fog and finally took place on 11 February 2021."

After Odermatt won the next-to-last race in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, while Pintaurault finished fourth, Odermatt passed Pinturault and took a 25-point lead in the discipline with just the finals in Lenzerheide, Switzerland (where Odermatt would have a home advantage) remaining. \nHowever, Pinturault himself then came from behind, winning the finals in Lenzerheide to pass Odermatt for the season championship in this discipline (and also to clinch the overall championship). This was Pinturault's first season title in giant slalom, becoming the first French champion in the discipline since 2002.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2021 World Ski Championships, which were held from 8–21 February in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.

        "text": "The 2022 Pro Bowl was the National Football League all-star game for the 2021 NFL season. It was played at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, on February 6, 2022. ESPN, ABC and Disney XD had the national television rights. Voting for the game started on November 16. The entire roster was announced on December 22. Mike Vrabel from the Tennessee Titans coached the AFC team, while Matt LaFleur from the Green Bay Packers coached the NFC team. This was the most recent traditional Pro Bowl game, as the NFL announced a switch in format for the 2022 season that included several skill competitions and a flag football game.\nBackground.\nThe league awarded the game to Allegiant Stadium, as a make-up for the 2021 Pro Bowl, which was originally scheduled to be held in that stadium before the COVID-19 pandemic forced alternative festivities to take place instead of an actual game. With the league expanding the regular season from a 16-game schedule to 17 games, the Pro Bowl was moved from the last weekend in January to the first weekend in February.\nSummary.\nBox score.\nIn the first quarter and a half, the NFC matched the AFC touchdown for touchdown, with the latter team leading by one due an unsuccessful two-point conversion after the NFC's second touchdown. After the AFC scored another touchdown before halftime, they continued to extend their lead in the third quarter with two more touchdowns, which gave them a 20-point lead at the end of that quarter. The NFC attempted a comeback, scoring 14 unanswered points in the fourth quarter, but the AFC took back and kept possession for the final two and a half minutes, securing their fifth consecutive Pro Bowl win.\nStarting lineups.\nStarting lineups are based on the lineups provided in the gamebook for the game. The only exception, since neither team ran their first play on offense with a fullback, is the fullback has been swapped out for the additional tight end for the NFC and additional wide receiver for the AFC.\nBroadcasting.\nThe game was televised nationally in the United States by ESPN, and simulcast on ABC and Disney XD."

Teams are typically seeded by conference record, with a tiebreaker system used to seed teams with identical conference records. However, due to numerous regular-season game cancellations, the WCC announced on February 16 that the seeding for the 2021 edition would be determined using an adjusted conference winning percentage. Developed in partnership with Ken Pomeroy, the adjusted conference winning percentage takes into account the strength of the opponent and the location where each game was played. The final report was released on February 28. \nThe tournament followed a format similar to that used from 2003 to 2011. The 7 through 10 seeds played in the \"first round\", the 5 and 6 seeds started play in the \"second round\", and the 3 and 4 seeds started in the \"quarterfinals\".

In the Final Four, Stanford defeated fellow No. 1 seed South Carolina by one point to reach their fifth title game; they entered seeking their third national championship.\nGame summary.\nThe game, played at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, began at 5:00 p.m. CDT. Shortly after tip-off, Stanford quickly took control of the contest. Both teams led briefly early in the first quarter before Lexie Hull took the lead for the Cardinal with 7:57 to play; they retained that lead for the remainder of the quarter, going on a 12–0 run and forcing the Wildcats to take an early timeout. The teams then traded two-point field goals before Trinity Baptiste scored a three-pointer to cut the Cardinal lead to 16–8; those points were the last of the quarter.\nArizona started the second quarter well, scoring twice to cut the lead to four before the teams traded shots. The Wildcats went on a run of their own from the late first quarter to the start of the second, a 12–2 span that put Arizona down by just one. Ashten Prechtel's layup with 6:21 on the clock put an end to the run, but a pair of free throws by Shaina Pellington shortly thereafter cut the Cardinal lead to one. Some moments later, a Pellington layup gave Arizona their first lead since the game was 3–2 in the first quarter. From there, the remainder of the half was controlled by the Cardinal, as they sparked an 11–0 run that put them up by ten before an Arizona layup and free throw cut the deficit to seven, where it remained until the buzzer.\nThe teams played evenly for much of the third quarter; entering up seven, Stanford traded baskets with Arizona before a pair of layups put the Cardinal up by 11. Aari McDonald quickly made a three-pointer and a pair of free throws to cut the lead to six, but Stanford responded with a couple of two-point baskets of their own to reestablish their double-digit lead. Over the remainder of the quarter, Arizona forced several turnovers on a 9–2 run to bring the margin down to three.\nStanford started the final quarter strongly, making three field goals in the first three minutes to extend their lead to eight. Aari McDonald made a three-pointer, to which Cameron Brink responded with a lay-in on a deep seal and then a block of a Shaina Pellington shot, before Arizona's offense converted several shots to cut the margin to a single point. With 2:24 to play, Stanford's Haley Jones completed a three-point play to make the score 54–50. From there, the only points scored were three free throws by Aari McDonald; despite a turnover on a shot clock violation by Stanford with six seconds left, the Wildcats were unable to overcome the one-point deficit, giving Stanford their third national title and first since 1992. With Tara VanDerveer having been Stanford's head coach since 1985 (taking the 1995–96 season off to coach the US women's national team at the 1996 Summer Olympics) and thus having coached all three of the program's national title teams, the 29-year gap between her most recent national titles is the longest in NCAA Division I history for a head coach in any sport.\nMedia coverage.\nThe Championship Game was televised in the United States by ESPN."

        "text": "Brian O. Gilmour is a Canadian retired ice hockey defenseman and coach who was an All-American for Boston University.\nCareer.\nGilmour was an all-star as a junior player and became a prized recruit for Jack Kelley. He began playing varsity hockey at Boston University in 1964 and the team went from 9 wins the year before up to 25 and finished atop the ECAC Hockey standings. An offensive defenseman by trade, Gilmour helped the Terriers score nearly 90 more goals during his sophomore season while also keeping the puck away from his net. BU finished third in the ECAC Tournament, narrowly missing out on a national tournament appearance. Gilmour continued to improve as a junior, increasing his point total and pushing Boston University up to 27 wins, setting a new program record. While the Terriers again finished 3rd in the ECAC Tournament, they received a bid to the NCAA Tournament when Cornell declined theirs. Gilmour's team was close in both games but ultimately lost both by one goal and finished last in the tournament.\nAs a senior Gilmour became the leader of the defense, after the graduation of Tom Ross. He helped BU finish undefeated in conference play and capture a second ECAC crown with a 19–0–1 record. Gilmour set program record for defensemen by scoring 54 points during the season. He also scored his 36th career goal, establishing a BU record that still stands (as of 2019). Gilmour became the first Terrier defender to record 100 career points and led the national scoring by a blue liner, end up 10th in the nation. He was named Second Team All-ECAC and an All-American. BU was the top-seeded team for the ECAC Tournament and the Terriers finally managed to reach the championship game, however, they were stymied by Cornell 3–4 and had to settle for the runner-up position. Gilmour was named to the All-Tournament First Team and the Terriers returned to the national tournament. The team was able to avenge their loos a year earlier by defeating Michigan State in the semifinal and reaching their first title game since 1950. In Gilmour's final game the team's offense could only muster a single goal and the Terriers were again defeated by Cornell. He was named to the All-Tournament Second Team\nAfter graduating, Gilmour returned to Canada and became the head coach for the McGill Redmen, remaining with the team for three seasons before heading to Cornwall to become a teacher at General Vanier Secondary School. The same year he founded Huron Hockey School and remained involved with the venture until 1997. When the WHA was founded in 1972 Gilmour became a scout for the New England Whalers for a couple years and he later served as an assistant coach for the Cornwall Royals. Gilmour was inducted into the Boston University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Cornwall Sports Hall of Fame in 2000."

The winners of the Division Series would move on to the League Championship Series to determine the pennant winners that face each other in the World Series.\nIn the American League, the Kansas City Royals made their second straight appearance, the New York Yankees returned for the first time since 2012, the Texas Rangers returned for the fourth time in six years, the Houston Astros made their first postseason appearance as a member of the American League, and the Toronto Blue Jays made their first postseason appearance since 1993.\nIn the National League, the St. Louis Cardinals made their fifth straight postseason appearance, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Pittsburgh Pirates made their third straight appearances, the Chicago Cubs returned for the first time since 2008, and the New York Mets made their first appearance since 2006.\nThe postseason began on October 6, and ended on November 1, with the Royals defeating the Mets in five games in the 2015 World Series. It was the first title in 30 years for the Royals, as well as the most recent postseason appearance by the franchise to date.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe following teams qualified for the postseason:\nPlayoff bracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nAmerican League Wild Card.\n(4) New York Yankees vs. (5) Houston Astros.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Astros and Yankees, and was the first postseason appearance by the Astros since 2005. The Astros shut out the Yankees 3–0 to advance to the ALDS. Both teams would meet again in the ALCS in 2017, 2019, and 2022, all won by the Astros.\nNational League Wild Card.\n(4) Pittsburgh Pirates vs. (5) Chicago Cubs.\nThe Cubs shut out the Pirates 4–0 to advance to the NLDS. This was the second straight year the Pirates were shutout in the Wild Card Game. As of 2022, this is the last postseason appearance by the Pirates, who now have the longest active postseason drought amongst National League teams.\nAmerican League Division Series.\n(1) Kansas City Royals vs. (5) Houston Astros.\nThe Royals rallied from a 2–1 series deficit to defeat the Astros in five games and return to the ALCS for the second straight year.\nBoth teams split the first two games in Kansas City — the Astros stole Game 1 on the road, while the Royals rallied in the sixth and seventh innings of Game 2 to even the series headed to Houston. Dallas Keuchel and the Astros' bullpen helped the Astros prevail 4–2 in Game 3 to take a 2–1 series lead, and were one win away from returning to the LCS for the first time since 2005. However, their lead would not hold. In Game 4, the Astros held a 6–2 lead after seven innings and looked poised to close out the series. Then, the Royals offense took apart the Astros bullpen, as they scored five unanswered runs to regain the lead. Eric Hosmer hit a two-run home run to increase the Royals' lead in the top of the ninth, and then the Royals' bullpen closed out the game in the bottom of the inning. This was the second straight year where the Royals down four runs and six outs away from elimination, were victorious. The Royals closed out the Astros with a convincing 7–2 victory thanks to a stellar pitching performance from Johnny Cueto, who was only two pitches away from pitching a perfect game.\nThe Astros would make their next postseason appearance in 2017, where they went on to win the World Series.\n(3) Toronto Blue Jays vs. (2) Texas Rangers.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Rangers and Blue Jays. The Rangers took a 2–0 series lead, but the Blue Jays rallied to tie the series. The Blue Jays defeated the Rangers in Game 5 to return to the ALCS for the first time since 1993. This was the first playoff series win by the Blue Jays since the 1993 World Series.\nThe Rangers stole the first two games in Toronto - they won by two runs in Game 1, and prevailed by two runs again in Game 2 after an ugly 14-inning affair. When the series shifted to Arlington, however, the Blue Jays would take Game 3 convincingly to avoid a sweep, and then took Game 4 by an 8–4 score to send the series back to Toronto. Game 5 of the series was notable for the events that transpired in the seventh inning - the Rangers made three consecutive errors, allowing the Blue Jays to tie the game at 3 runs each. Then José Bautista hit a game-sealing 3-run home run, and before running the bases, flipped his bat in celebration. Both benches cleared for a brief scuffle between both teams, but it was resolved shortly after. The Blue Jays closed out the series in the top of the ninth to advance. This was the third time a team won a best-of-five series after losing the first two games at home, and the second time in the 2–2–1 format.\nBoth teams would meet again in the ALDS the next year, which the Blue Jays won in a sweep.\nNational League Division Series.\n(1) St. Louis Cardinals vs. (5) Chicago Cubs.\nThis was the first postseason meeting in the history of the Cardinals–Cubs rivalry. The Cubs defeated the top-seeded Cardinals in four games to return to the NLCS for the first time since 2003.\nJohn Lackey helped the Cardinals prevail in a shutout in Game 1. In Game 2, the Cubs jumped out to an early 6–1 lead and did not relinquish it, as the Cubs bullpen held the Cardinals' offense to just two more runs scored to even the series. Game 3 was an offensive duel which the Cubs won 8–6 in which Chicago hit six home runs. The Cubs then took Game 4 by a 6–4 score to win their first playoff series at Wrigley Field, and deny the Cardinals a fifth straight NLCS appearance.\n(2) Los Angeles Dodgers vs. (3) New York Mets.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Dodgers and Mets, having split the first two meetings (Dodgers won 4–3 in the 1988 NLCS; Mets won 3–0 in the 2006 NLDS). The Mets defeated the Dodgers in five games to advance to the NLCS for the first time since 2006.\nJacob deGrom had a solid pitching performance in Game 1 as the Mets won 3–1. The Dodgers rallied with a 4-run seventh inning to even the series headed to Queens. Game 3 was an offensive duel which the Mets won 13–7 to take a 2–1 series lead. The Dodgers evened the series in Game 4 thanks to a stellar pitching performance from Clayton Kershaw, and were now headed back to Los Angeles for a series-deciding Game 5. However, the Mets would narrowly prevail as deGrom and closer Jeurys Familia helped keep the Dodgers' offense at bay after the first inning.\nAmerican League Championship Series.\n(1) Kansas City Royals vs. (2) Toronto Blue Jays.\nThis was a rematch of the 1985 ALCS, which the Royals won in seven games after trailing 3–1 in the series. On the 30th anniversary of their previous postseason meeting, the Royals again defeated the Blue Jays, this time in six games, to advance to the World Series for the second year in a row.\nIn Kansas City, the Royals controlled the first two games - they prevailed in a 6–0 shutout in Game 1, and scored six runs again in Game 2 to go up 2–0 in the series headed to Toronto. Game 3 was an offensive duel which the Blue Jays won 11–8 to avoid a sweep. In Game 4, the Royals routed the Blue Jays in a 14–2 blowout to go up 3–1 in the series. While the Blue Jays blew out the Royals, 7–1, in Game 5 to send the series back to Kansas City, the Royals closed out the series with a 4–3 win in Game 6 to secure the pennant.\nAs of 2023, this is the last time the Royals won the AL pennant. The Blue Jays returned to the ALCS the next year, but fell to the Cleveland Indians in five games.\nNational League Championship Series.\n(3) New York Mets vs. (5) Chicago Cubs.\nThe Mets swept the Cubs to return to the World Series for the first time since .\nThe Mets took Game 1 thanks to a solid pitching performance from Matt Harvey. In Game 2, Noah Syndergaard and the Mets' bullpen held the Cubs to just one run to take a 2–0 series lead headed to Chicago. In Game 3, the Cubs tied the game in the bottom of the fourth, however the Mets scored three unanswered runs in the sixth and seventh innings to win and take a 3–0 series lead. In Game 4, the Mets jumped out to a big lead early and did not relinquish it, clinching the pennant. This was the first NLCS which the team who swept the series did not trail in any of the games.\nBy coincidence, the Cubs' 2015 season ended on the same day as the 2015 World Series that was depicted in \"Back to the Future Part II\". In the film, the Cubs swept a fictitious Miami team. However, the prediction in \"Back to the Future Part II\" was only off by one year, as the Cubs went on to win the 2016 World Series against the Cleveland Indians in seven games.\nAs of 2023, this is the last time the Mets won the NL pennant, as well as the last time a team from New York City won a pennant.\n2015 World Series.\n(AL1) Kansas City Royals vs. (NL3) New York Mets.\nThis was the first World Series to feature two expansion teams - the Mets were the first expansion team to win the World Series overall in 1969, while the Royals became the first American League expansion team to win the World Series, doing so in 1985. The Royals defeated the Mets in five games to win their first World Series title since 1985.\nIn Game 1, the Mets held a 4–3 lead in the bottom of the ninth, however the Royals' Alex Gordon hit a solo home run to tie the game, handing New York's Jeurys Familia his first blown save in six postseason opportunities. Eric Hosmer won Game 1 for the Royals in the bottom of the fourteenth with a sacrifice fly. In Game 2, the Royals blew out the Mets thanks to a complete game performance from Johnny Cueto to go up 2–0 in the series headed to Queens. In Game 3, the Mets blew out the Royals by a 9–3 score thanks to a solid pitching performance by Noah Syndergaard to avoid a sweep. However, the Royals would take Game 4 by a 5–3 score to go up 3–1 in the series. In Game 5, New York's Matt Harvey helped keep the Royals' offense at bay and maintained a 2–0 lead for the Mets going into the bottom of the ninth. However, the Royals' Eric Hosmer cut the Mets lead to one with an RBI double which scored Lorenzo Cain, which prompted Mets manager Terry Collins to relive Harvey with Jeurys Familia. This decision proved to be fatal for the Mets, as Familia had yet another blown save as Hosmer stole home plate to tie the game. The game went scoreless throughout the tenth and eleventh innings, until the Royals broke the game open in the top of the twelfth, scoring five runs to take the lead for good, effectively securing the title. This was the second time in a row that the Mets lost the World Series at their home stadium ().\nAs of 2023, this is the last postseason appearance by the Royals franchise, as well as the last postseason appearance outside of the Wild Card round for the Mets. It is also the most recent World Series appearance for the Mets, and was the only World Series appearance by a team from New York City during the 2010s decade, making the first decade since the 1910s decade that a team from New York City didn't win a World Series.\nBroadcasting.\nThis was second year of eight-year U.S. TV contracts with ESPN, Fox Sports, and TBS. ESPN aired the American League Wild Card Game, Fox Sports 1 and MLB Network split the American League Division Series, and the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports 1 split the American League Championship Series. TBS had the National League Wild Card Game, Division Series, and Championship Series, with sister network TNT used as an overflow channel. The World Series then aired on the Fox broadcast network for the 16th consecutive year."

The event determined the champion of the Colonial Athletic Association for the 2002 season. Sixth-seeded won the tournament for the first time and earned the CAA's automatic bid to the 2002 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. For the first time, the conference named an All-Tournament Team rather than simply a Most Outstanding Player.\nEntering the event, former member East Carolina had won the most championships, with seven. Among active members, Old Dominion led with three titles while George Mason had won twice and William &amp; Mary won once.\nFormat and seeding.\nThe CAA's two division winners received the top two seeds and a first round bye, as determined by division record. James Madison and William &amp; Mary both finished with 9–3 records in their divisions. The next four teams, regardless of division, were selected and seeded by conference winning percentage. They played a double-elimination tournament. This resulted in William &amp; Mary receiving a higher seed than three teams in their own division who finished with higher conference winning percentages.\nAll-Tournament Team.\nThe following players were named to the All-Tournament Team.\nMost Valuable Player.\nBrian Marshall was named Tournament Most Valuable Player. Marshall was a pitcher for VCU."

        "text": "John Walter Roxborough (February 21, 1892 - December 13, 1975) was an American bookmaker, boxing manager and professional sports gambler who, alongside boxing promoter Julian Black, managed the career of Joe Louis. Roxborough and Black were responsible for developing Louis' public image from Louis' rise from amateur status to the end of his heavyweight career in 1949.\nEarly life.\nRoxborough was one of four children born to lawyer Charles A. Roxborough II (1856-1908) and Virginia Gertrude Roxborough (1863-1935) in Plaquemine, Louisiana, both of whom were of European and African descent. The family relocated from Louisiana to Detroit, Michigan in 1899. One of his brothers, Charles III, later became the first Black person elected to the Michigan Senate.\nCareer.\nRoxborough, in his youth and early adulthood, played basketball, and would assist youth sports programs in predominantly-Black areas of Detroit in the 1920s. He also ran a real estate office in Detroit's Paradise Valley which moonlighted as a front for an illegal numbers ring. Roxborough first came across Joe Louis when Louis was competing in amateur boxing in 1931. As Louis explained in his autobiography, Roxborough convinced the young fighter that white managers would have no real interest in seeing a black boxer work his way up to title contention:\n[Roxborough] told me about the fate of most black fighters, ones with white managers, who wound up burned-out and broke before they reached their prime. The white managers were not interested in the men they were handling but in the money they could make from them. They didn't take the proper time to see that their fighters had a proper training, that they lived comfortably, or ate well, or had some pocket change. Mr. Roxborough was talking about Black Power before it became popular.\nRoxborough recruited Chicago lawyer and numbers runner Julian Black to help develop Louis' career, and also recruited Jack Blackburn to coach Louis. In 1935, after Louis turned 21, Roxborough and Black convinced Louis to sign a contract which collectively dedicated half of Louis' future income to the pair.\nRoxborough and Black were aware of the blowback against Jack Johnson's life and lifestyle, and heavily regulated Louis' behavior in public in order to avoid scrutiny from white audiences.\nRoxborough became rich from Louis' career in the ring, but continued to operate a numbers racket. He was eventually convicted and sent to a two-and-a-half year sentence in state prison in 1944. After his release, Roxborough continued as Louis' co-manager until after Louis' last fight with Rocky Marciano in 1949. Roxborough provided Louis with a lifetime position as vice president and director of youth activities at the Superior Life Insurance Society of Michigan.\nPersonal life.\nRoxborough married Wilhelmina Morris in 1937 and divorced in 1954 with no children.\nRoxborough died in Detroit on December 1, 1975 at the age of 83."

        "title": "History of English cricket (1801–1825)",
        "text": "Through the Napoleonic Wars, county cricket virtually died as cricket was impacted by losses of investment and manpower.\nImpact of the Napoleonic Wars.\nWith no national competition in place, there were few senior matches in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Even so, there is a noticeable difference between the number played each season in the 1790s and the handful per season of the 1800s and, much less, the 1810s. The ACS in its \"Important Matches\" guide has listed more than twenty in 1795, a time of stalemate in the French Revolutionary Wars; but only six in 1805, the year of the Battle of Trafalgar; and then just three for the whole period from 1811 to 1813 when British forces were heavily involved in the Peninsular War. Nevertheless, the impact of this war was less severe than that of the Seven Years' War because of the existence this time of MCC and other well-organised clubs like Brighton and Montpelier. These clubs managed to co-ordinate cricket activities through the war and, as it were, keep the game going.\nIn 1803, William Pitt referred to cricket when the Commons debated the Defence Bill that was later passed into law as the Defence of the Realm Act 1803. Pitt was then the effective Leader of the Opposition to the Whig government of Henry Addington. One of the Act's key requirements was that local authorities must list able-bodied men aged fifteen to sixty, and classify them in terms of fitness for military service. As increasing numbers of young men entered service, cricket went into decline and, on 17 September 1813, the \"Nottingham Review\" said: \"The manly and athletic game at cricket for which the boys of Sherwood have been so long and so justly famed, it was thought, had fallen into disuse, if not disgrace...\" Also, there is a view expressed by Rowland Bowen that the game had gone out of fashion in addition to the wartime problems it faced.\nThe first cricketer known to have died on active service was Richard Beckett of Leeds, whose senior career spanned the 1804 to 1807 seasons. He joined the Coldstream Guards and, as a captain, was killed at the Battle of Talavera on 28 July 1809.\nA discernible recovery began in 1815 as the Napoleonic Wars ended after the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June. Six senior matches have been recorded from that summer and the first centuries were scored at the new Lord's ground in St John's Wood. The centuries were scored in the Middlesex v Epsom match on 24 &amp; 25 August by Felix Ladbroke and Frederick Woodbridge who scored 116 and 107 respectively for Epsom.\nAmong debutants in 1815 was Algernon Greville, better known as the Duke of Wellington's private secretary from 1819. Greville fought at Waterloo as an ensign. He played in seven senior matches until 1823.\nMCC and Lord's.\nOld Ground.\nMarylebone Cricket Club (MCC), based at Lord's Old Ground until 1810, continued to play the leading role in the sport. Several matches of the 1800s involved the more prominent town clubs such as Homerton, Montpelier, Richmond and Woolwich.\nBy the 1800s, Lord's Old Ground was already losing its rural character as London expanded and began to surround it. The landowning Portman Estate felt able to increase the rent and so Thomas Lord decided to seek another venue. The lease on the Old Ground was due to expire on Lady Day (25 March) in 1810 but Lord moved fast and, by May 1809, had secured a lease on another plot of land, part of the St John's Wood estate which belonged to the Eyre family. The match in August 1810 between Captain Blagrave's XI and Colonel Byng's XI is the last known to have been played on Lord's Old Ground.\nMiddle Ground.\nLord opened his \"Middle Ground\" in time for the 1809 season but MCC at first refused to relocate. The Middle Ground was used by St John's Wood Cricket Club while MCC continued to play at the Old Ground. In the winter of 1810–11, Lord staged a \"fait accompli\" by seizing \"his turf\" which was dug up and moved to the Middle Ground. Despite the opposition voiced by some members, MCC were obliged to follow.\nRecords of only three senior matches have been found for the years 1811 to 1813 with the war taking an increasing toll of cricket's manpower and investment. All were played at the Middle Ground and are the only known senior matches played there. Benjamin Aislabie's XI v George Osbaldeston's XI at the Middle Ground on 8–9 July 1811; Lord Frederick Beauclerk's XI v George Osbaldeston's XI at the Middle Ground on 15–17 June 1812; and Lord Frederick Beauclerk's XI v Edward Bligh's XI on 7–9 June 1813 – this was the last senior match known to have been played on the Middle Ground. James Rice played in all three and they are the only ones he is known to have played in.\nIn 1813, the site of the Middle Ground was requisitioned by Parliament for construction of the Regent's Canal. Lord contacted the Eyre Estate and persuaded them to lease him another parcel of land in St John's Wood, about half a mile further north at a place called North Bank. This site had previously been a duckpond.\nLord's – the current ground.\nIn the winter of 1813–14, Lord again had his turf dug up and removed. He built a high perimeter fence, a tavern and a pavilion at what became the current Lord's ground. On 22 June 1814, MCC played the first match at Lord's against Hertfordshire, then as now a minor county team. The first match of importance at Lord's was played 13–15 July 1814 when MCC hosted St John's Wood CC, whose team included a number of Surrey county players. St John's Wood CC was incorporated into MCC soon afterwards.\nMCC – influence and controversy.\nBy 1816, the new Lord's had become cricket's feature venue and MCC was gradually increasing its influence and control. It made efforts to suppress the gambling that had underwritten and sometimes blighted cricket in the past.\nBut MCC was by no means in full control of events. It was the subject of bitter controversy in the post-war period, largely because of the activities of Lord Frederick Beauclerk, one of the sport's more dubious personalities who effectively \"ran\" the MCC Committee for many years. There was fierce infighting between Beauclerk and his enemy George Osbaldeston which finally erupted into a match-fixing scandal. In 1817, soon after his unique achievement of scoring two centuries in the same match, it was alleged that William Lambert had \"sold\" an earlier Nottingham v England match. Nottingham had won the game by 30 runs despite a first innings deficit and many gamblers lost heavily. MCC banned Lambert from Lord's for life. Whether he was actually guilty is questionable as no proper hearing was ever organised. The whole affair may have been contrived by Beauclerk to settle an \"old score\". After MCC banned Lambert in 1817, his patron Osbaldeston struck his own name from the MCC members list in anger in 1818. He later repented and tried to restore himself but his application was blocked by Beauclerk. Osbaldeston could no longer play at Lord's and that effectively ended his senior career.\nIn 1822, MCC appointed Benjamin Aislabie as its first honorary secretary (to 1842). Aislabie was a rich wine merchant and the owner of slave-operated plantations in the West Indies.\nThe crisis of 1825.\nIn 1825, the club almost foundered in the face of a dual crisis. On Thursday, 28 July, a schools match at Lord's between Harrow and Winchester had just concluded. Then, during the night, the pavilion was destroyed by fire with the consequent loss of valuable scorecards, records and trophies. Lord claimed he lost £2,600 in paid subscriptions, none of which were ever recovered. Many irreplaceable documents which recorded early cricket matches are believed to have been lost. The impact of this upon cricket's history is that it is only since 1825 that surviving records can be viewed with anything like complete confidence.\nLater that year, MCC members were outraged when Lord proposed to build houses on the land. William Ward, who was a rich banker as well as a good batsman, stepped in and purchased the ground lease of Lord's to save it for cricket.\nAlso in 1825, Charles James Barnett became the earliest known president of MCC. This is an annual appointment and there may have been earlier presidents but there is no record of them, perhaps because the records were lost in the fire.\nSchools and universities.\nThe Eton v Harrow match was first definitely recorded at Lord's in 1805 but, according to a Harrovian who played in that match, the fixture also took place in 1804 with Harrow winning. Lord Byron played for Harrow in 1805.\nOn 30 May 1817, Cambridge University played Cambridge Town Club at Parker's Piece, Cambridge, the first recorded instance of a fixture which became almost annual until the 1860s and the earliest first-class match involving either team. There was a very fine line between Cambridge Town Club and the later Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club, the one dovetailing with the other.\nNoted people.\nWilliam Lambert made his known senior debut playing for Surrey against England at Lord's on 20 July 1801. He became, in Haygarth's words, \"one of the most successful cricketers that has ever yet appeared, excelling as he did in batting, bowling, fielding, keeping wicket, and also single wicket playing\".\nE. H. Budd, who went on to become one of the most famous batsmen of the early 19th century, made his known senior debut in 1802.\nThomas Howard, one of the most outstanding fast bowlers of the underarm era, made his known senior debut on 4–6 July 1803 when he played for Hampshire against a combined Nottinghamshire &amp; Leicestershire team at Lord's.\nJohn Sherman made his senior debut in 1809. His career continued to 1852 and at 44 seasons is the joint-longest on record, equalled only by W. G. Grace from 1865 to 1908.\nJem Broadbridge, who became an outstanding all-rounder in the 1820s, made his known senior debut on 22 July 1814 in a Beauclerk v Osbaldeston match at Goodwood Park.\nIn 1820, two noteworthy debutants were Fuller Pilch (aged 17) and George T. Knight. Pilch, then of Norfolk, later played for Kent and is often considered to have been W. G. Grace's predecessor as the greatest-ever batsman. Knight, who was a nephew of Jane Austen, became a prominent member of MCC and played a significant part in the introduction and legalisation of roundarm bowling between 1825 and 1835. He was himself a fast bowler who favoured the roundarm style.\nThe 1822 debutants included the left-handed batsman James Saunders, noted for his expertise in playing the square cut shot.\nTwo of the greatest players of the 19th century, bowler William Lillywhite and wicket-keeper Ned Wenman, made their first known appearances in 1825.\nActive players, administrators and other contributors of the period included:\nAchievements.\nIn 1805, Lord Frederick Beauclerk became the first batsman known to have scored two centuries in the same season. He made 129* for Hampshire v England in July and 102 for England v Surrey in August.\nOn 2–5 July 1817, Sussex v Epsom was played at Lord's. William Lambert, guesting for Sussex, scored two centuries (107* &amp; 157) in the match, the first player known to have achieved this feat in a top-class match.\nOn 24 July 1820, William Ward scored 278 for MCC against Norfolk at Lord's, the earliest-known double century in all forms of cricket. Ward established a new world record for the highest individual innings, beating James Aylward's score of 167 in 1777. Ward's record survived for 56 years until W. G. Grace scored the first-ever triple-century with an innings of 344 for the Gentlemen of MCC against Kent at Canterbury in 1876.\nMatches, venues and teams.\nThe Bs.\nMatches during this period were arranged on an \"ad hoc\" basis and many teams were invitation XIs, some of them given unusual names. One of these, created in 1805, was \"The Bs\", although it was not a one-off and reformed several times until 1832. Billy Beldham, for example, played for The Bs four times. Their most famous match was on 12–14 June 1810, against England at Lord's Old Ground. The Bs were two men short and were joined by John Wells and James Lawrell as given men. According to Haygarth, Lawrell was only involved because he had backed the team: \"certainly not for his excellence as a cricketer, as in the case of Wells\".\nThe Bs batted first and scored 137. In reply, England were dismissed for 100. With a lead of 37 in difficult batting conditions, the Bs were in a strong position as they began their second innings. Any hopes they had of making a decent total quickly disappeared as they were bowled out for only 6. Five of their runs were scored by Wells (4) and Lawrell (1); only one B, Samuel Bridger, scored a run, though John Bentley was the not out batsman and E. H. Budd was absent injured. There were only three scoring shots because Wells hit a boundary. John Hammond dismissed at least six of the nine batsmen who were out, including five bowled. Chasing a total of 44 runs to win, England soon lost their first four wickets, but Robert Robinson scored 23 not out and they won by 6 wickets.\nThe Bs total of 6 is sometimes listed as the world record for the lowest innings total in first-class cricket, but the match was played long before the official commencement of first-class cricket and is not recognised by either \"Wisden\" or \"Playfair\", among others.\nEngland Elevens.\nEngland teams played in most of the senior matches from 1801 to 1810. There were none in the main war years of 1811–1814. From 1815 to 1825, there were twelve, a significant reduction in proportion compared with 1801–1810.\nCounty cricket.\nThe first reference to cricket in the county of Cornwall is dated 1813.\nAccording to \"Wisden\", a forerunner of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club may have been founded in 1820 but, if so, it was subject to reformation and substantial reorganisation in 1878. The current club recognises 1878 as its foundation date.\nThere is evidence in 1824 of a county club having been formed in Devon, though the current Devon County Cricket Club dates from 1899.\nIn 1825, inter-county cricket was revived for the first time since 1796. Sussex played two matches each (home and away) against Hampshire and Kent, the home team winning every time. Hampshire and Kent did not play each other.\nGentlemen v Players.\nThe first two Gentlemen v Players matches took place in 1806 but the fixture was not revived until 1819.\nGentlemen v Players was revived in 1819. It had first been played in 1806, when there were two matches, but not since then. It was played in most seasons from 1819 to 1962, typically twice a year. The fixture was described by H. S. Altham as the \"most famous of all domestic matches\". In the 1819 match, the Players won by six wickets. There was only one run between the sides on first innings but the Gentlemen collapsed in the second against the bowling of Thomas Howard and John Sherman to be all out for only 60. Charles Greville, the noted diarist, made his known senior debut in this match, playing for the Gentlemen. Another debutant was the Sussex fast bowler George Brown, widely known as \"Brown of Brighton\", who had a reputation for bowling at extreme pace.\nIn the fourth Gentlemen v Players match, played at Lord's in June 1820, the Gentlemen selected star Players bowler Thomas Howard as a given man, and won the match by 70 runs.\nIn the fifth Gentlemen v Players match, played at Lord's in July 1821, Thomas Beagley scored the first century in the series with 113 not out for the Players. The Gentlemen had been dismissed for 60 in their first innings and then, after the Players made 270 for 6, the Gentlemen gave up and conceded the game. It was a \"Coronation Match\" to celebrate the accession of the unpopular King George IV and Derek Birley commented that it was \"a suitably murky affair\". The match marked the final senior appearance of Billy Beldham in a career lasting from 1782.\nThe 1824 match at Lord's was an odds game with 14 on the Gentlemen team, but the Players still won by 103 runs.\nSingle wicket.\nJohn Major lists eight top-class single wicket events during the period. One was the notorious Lambert &amp; Osbaldeston v Beauclerk &amp; Howard match at the Old Ground on 6–7 July 1810.\nRules and equipment.\nIn 1801, MCC made revisions to the \"Laws of Cricket\" which were republished in their entirety.\nIn 1809, MCC made further revisions to the \"Laws of Cricket\" which were again republished in their entirety. Among the changes were the umpires being required to select the pitch; choice of innings to be decided by toss; no-ball applied to the bowler's foot being over the crease.\nIn 1810, an American visitor drew a sharp distinction between cricket as played in England and \"our cricket\", referring especially to the \"old long low wicket\" still used in America.\nNo-ball rule applied to throwing in 1816.\nThe earliest mention of wicket-keeping gloves occurs in 1820.\nIn 1823, the size of the wicket was increased to 27 × 8 inches.\nRoundarm.\nIn 1807, John Willes of Kent first tried to revive the idea of \"straight-armed\" (i.e., roundarm) bowling, which had originated with Tom Walker in the 1790s.\nDuring the post-war years, there was a discernible shift towards the adoption of roundarm and questions about its legalisation dominated the sport for thirty years. The issue was already controversial enough in 1816 for MCC to amend the \"Laws of Cricket\" to prohibit it:\nThe issue came to a head in 1822 when, in the MCC v Kent match at Lord's, Willes opened the bowling for Kent and was no-balled for using a roundarm action. He promptly withdrew from the match and refused to play again in any significant fixture. Roundarm was a natural reaction to the growing predominance of batsmen over the age-old underarm style of bowling. Its adherents argued that the legalisation of roundarm was essential to restore the balance between batting and bowling. However, high-scoring matches were still comparatively rare owing to vagaries in pitch conditions.\nLiterature.\nIn 1801, Thomas Boxall published the earliest known instructional book on cricket called \"Rules and Instructions for Playing at the Game of Cricket\".\nIn 1819, Mary Russell Mitford began writing a series of sketches of village life which were published in \"The Lady's Magazine\". They were subsequently collected in book form as \"Our Village\". One piece was a description of a cricket match which has been described as \"the first major prose on the game\".\nIn 1823, Henry Bentley published his \"Correct Account of all Matches, 1786–1822\" with supplements appearing to 1825."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Ulysses S. Grant",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of Ulysses S. Grant is a public monument in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Located in Fairmount Park, the monument honors Ulysses S. Grant, who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War and later as President of the United States. The monument was designed by Daniel Chester French and Edward Clark Potter and consists of an equestrian statue atop a pedestal. The statue was dedicated in 1899.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe son of Jesse Root Grant and Hannah Simpson Grant, Ulysses S. Grant was born in Point Pleasant, Ohio, United States on April 27, 1822. In spring 1839, at the age of 17, Grant enrolled in the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, graduating several years later in 1843. Several years later, Grant saw action in the Mexican–American War. At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Grant, who by this time had pursued a civilian career, returned to military service in the Union Army, where he rose through the ranks as a commander, and in 1864 was promoted to lieutenant general. Grant's military service culminated in Lee's surrender on April 9, 1865, which marked the start of the conclusion of the American Civil War. Following the war, Grant was elected President of the United States in the 1868 United States presidential election, a position he would hold until 1877. Grant died several years after leaving office on July 23, 1885.\nCreation.\nFollowing Grant's death, the Fairmount Park Art Association in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania began to fundraise for the creation of a monument honoring Grant in the city's Fairmount Park. By March 1886, the association had raised $12,153.56, which by 1893 had grown to $23,450.50. Additionally, the Philadelphia City Council provided $9,000 in additional funding. Following this, the association accepted proposals from various American sculptors, ultimately selecting Daniel Chester French and Edward Clark Potter to design an equestrian statue of Grant, with French designing the sculpture of Grant and Potter designing the horse. They were officially commissioned on January 23, 1894. The statue was cast by the Bureau Brothers Foundry in Philadelphia, with the statue's pedestal designed by Frank Miles Day &amp; Brother. The total cost for the construction of the monument was $32,675.35.\nDedication.\nBy Fall 1897, the monument was completed and put in place in Fairmount Park, with tentative plans to unveil the monument on April 27, 1898 (Grant's birthday). However, the sinking of the USS Maine and the subsequent declaration of the Spanish–American War in 1898 caused the dedication ceremony to be delayed. Subsequently, the ceremony was rescheduled to October 27, 1898 (Military Day). However, issues related to an associated military parade caused the ceremony to once more be rescheduled to April 27, 1899. In Fall 1898, President William McKinley was invited to attend the ceremony, which he accepted. Additional invitations were extended to members of the President's cabinet, several military officers, and members of Grant's family. At 2:00 p.m. on the date of the ceremony, a procession was held through the city to Fairmount Park, with President McKinley escorted by the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry. In addition to the previously listed guests, the procession included many consuls. At 3:00 p.m., the procession ended and the guests took their places near the monument. \nWith the guests in place at the monument, the First Battalion, Naval Force of Pennsylvania performed a 21-gun salute for the President. Following this, Philadelphia Mayor Samuel Howell Ashbridge introduced Bishop Ozi William Whitaker of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania, who gave an invocation for the monument. This prayer was followed by an address by Ashbridge, after which the monument was officially presented to the city by John H. Converse, the president of the Fairmount Park Art Association. As Converse's speech came to a close, Algernon Edward Sartoris and his sister Rosemary Sartoris (grandchildren of Ulysses S. Grant) moved to the top of a large platform next to the monument and removed the bunting that covered the statue. A 17-gun salute was performed by troops at the ceremony, which was followed by another 17-gun salute performed by the USS \"Raleigh\", which was anchored nearby in the Delaware River. An American flag, which had been used by General Nelson A. Miles at his headquarters in Ponce, Puerto Rico, was draped around the pedestal. It had been sent to be used in the ceremony by the National Society, Children of the American Revolution.\nFollowing the statue's unveiling, an additional speech was given and French and Potter were introduced to the crowd, to large applaud. Three wreaths were placed on the pedestal, presented by the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (which Grant had been a member of), Chinese ambassador to the United States Wu Tingfang, and the Society of Daughters of the Revolution. Afterwards, another parade was held with President McKinley and other distinguished guests, which was followed by a celebratory dinner held at the Union League of Philadelphia. The final part of the festivities related to the monument's dedication took place later that night at the Academy of Music, where multiple orations were given regarding Grant and the statue.\nDesign.\nAccording to a publication issued by the Fairmount Park Art Association after the monument's unveiling, the statue depicts a moment when Grant is surveying a battlefield. Ulysses's son Frederick Dent Grant assisted the sculptors in the design of Grant's hat and overcoat. The statue of the horse is modeled after General Grant, a gelding descended from a horse owned by Grant. The statue weighs approximately and has a height of slightly over . The granite pedestal for the statue is a pale pink and also has a height of slightly over . The front of the pedestal features a bronze wreath surrounding the word \"GRANT\".\nThe monument is located at the intersection of Fountain Green Drive and East Park River Drive inside the park."

        "text": "The Philippine National Volleyball Federation Inc. (PNVF), also known as Volleyball Philippines, is the national sport association for volleyball in the Philippines. It is recognized by the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC), the Asian Volleyball Confederation (AVC) and the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB).\nHistory.\nPVF–LVPI dispute.\nPrior to the formation of the Philippine National Volleyball Federation (PNVF), the Philippine Volleyball Federation (PVF) was recognized by the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) as the national sports association for volleyball in the Philippines. The PVF lost POC recognition in 2014 following a leadership crisis after PVF Vice-president Karl Chan assumed the presidency after PVF President Gener Dungo filed an indefinite leave of absence. Dungo was alleged to have mismanaged the PVF's funds.\nThe Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) in January 2015, gave provisional membership to a new volleyball federation, the Larong Volleyball sa Pilipinas, Inc. (LVPI) The PVF was suspended but remained affiliated with the FIVB, although it has lost all its rights associated with membership. The provisional status has allowed the LVPI to organize and send national teams to FIVB-sanctioned events for the next few years a privilege which was previously reserved to the PVF. Although the PVF continues to claim that it is the legitimate national sports association for volleyball in the Philippines. The LVPI on their part has lobbied to be granted full FIVB-membership and the full expulsion of PVF from the international volleyball body.\nFormation.\nThe FIVB announced in January 2020, that it would send a delegation to end the PVF-LVPI dispute. The Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) then scheduled an election to determine the officials of a new national sports association for volleyball prior to the 2021 FIVB World Congress in a bid to end the dispute. The POC reportedly had talks that the contested positions to be divided among the LVPI, PVF, a third group called the Alliances of Philippine Volleyball Inc. (APVI), and itself. PVF President Edgardo Cantada rejected the POC's proposal Although several PVF officials defied Cantada's stance and expressed interest to join the elections.\nIn 2021, the PNVF was formed with its first set of officials elected on January 25, 2021, in an interim basis. Ramon \"Tats\" Suzara of AVPI was elected as the PNVF's president unopposed with Ricky Palou withdrawing his presidential bid.\nThe PNVF was given provisional membership in the POC on January 27, 2021, with a Securities and Exchange Commission registration needed to be given full membership in the POC.\nIn February 2021, PNVF gets official recognition from FIVB as the national governing body in the Philippines as the PVF was expelled. It plans to launch the league in July 2021. It has also received recognition from the Asian Volleyball Confederation, the Asia's governing body.\nThe PNVF plans to organize its own domestic league separate from the two existing commercial leagues, the Premier Volleyball League and the Philippine Super Liga. The proposed name for the league is the PNVF Champions League. The PNVF announced plans to hold an inaugural season of a men's league in September 2021."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured England in June 2021 to play two Test matches against the England cricket team. In April 2021, New Zealand named their squad for the two-match series, with the same team also being named for the 2021 ICC World Test Championship Final, which was also played in England later in June 2021. The following month, England named their Test squad, with several players rested following their participation in the 2021 Indian Premier League.\nThe first Test ended in a draw, after no play was possible on the third day due to rain. Devon Conway, on his Test debut for New Zealand, scored 200 runs in the first innings. In the second Test, James Anderson played in his 162nd match, becoming the most capped player for England in Test cricket. New Zealand won the second Test by eight wickets to win the series 1–0. It was the first time that New Zealand had won a Test series in England since 1999, and it was also England's first Test series defeat at home since losing to Sri Lanka in 2014.\nSquads.\nThe England squad left out Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Sam Curran, Moeen Ali and Jonny Bairstow, rested after their participation in the 2021 Indian Premier League. Also missing were Jofra Archer, out with an elbow injury, and Ben Stokes, with a broken finger. Jack Leach was the only spinner to be selected, with Dom Bess being left out of the squad. Ollie Robinson and James Bracey were both included, with neither of them capped at Test level. Ahead of the series, Ben Foakes was ruled out of England's squad after suffering a hamstring injury. As a result of Foakes being ruled out of the series, Sam Billings and Haseeb Hameed were both added to England's squad. With Ben Stokes being unavailable for the series, Stuart Broad was named as the vice-captain for England.\nOllie Robinson made his debut for England in the first Test match of the series. On the day of his international debut, Robinson had to make an apology for making racist and sexist tweets in 2012 and 2013. On 6 June 2021, Robinson was removed from the England squad for the second Test match of the series, and suspended from all formats of international cricket by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). Dom Bess was added to England's squad for the second Test.\nKane Williamson was ruled out of New Zealand's squad for the second Test due to an elbow injury. As a result, Tom Latham was named as New Zealand's captain for the match. Mitchell Santner was also ruled out of New Zealand's squad for the second Test due to a finger injury, and BJ Watling was additionally ruled out due to a back injury.\nTour match.\nAhead of the Test series, New Zealand were scheduled to play a tour match against Somerset. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, New Zealand would play a two-day intra-squad match instead. Tom Latham and Kane Williamson were named as the captains of each side. On 17 May 2021, the majority of New Zealand's squad arrived in England."

The Warriors represented Merrimack College and were coached by Scott Borek, in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Merrimack's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nDue to cancellations and rescheduling Merrimack began the season playing ranked teams in eight consecutive games. As a result, the team's record was a paltry 1–7. Despite the losses, the team was able to keep the score close in most games and used the experience to improve in the second half of the season. Merrimack ended the regular season on a 4–4–2 run, not a particularly stellar record, but a vast improvement over their start. The Warriors had risen to 9th in the conference and were getting ready to play Vermont on the final week of the regular season. Unfortunately, several members of the team entered COVID-19 protocols on March 4. As a result, not only was the Vermont series cancelled but, since the team could not feasibly receive a clean bill of health before the Hockey East Tournament began on March 10, Merrimack had to withdraw from postseason play and end their season.\nJames Corcoran and Jordan Seyfert sat out the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The women's overall in the 2021 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup involved 31 events in 5 disciplines: downhill (DH), Super-G (SG), giant slalom (GS), slalom (SL), and parallel (PAR). The sixth discipline, Alpine combined (AC), had all three of its events in the 2020–21 season cancelled, The tentative women's season schedule included 37 events (plus two team parallels, including one to take place at the season finals), but the final women's schedule cut the number of events to 34 (and only one team parallel) due to the continuing disruption cased by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the changes were the elimination of the three Alpine combined races (Val d'Isére, St. Anton, Crans Montana) to eliminate the mixing of speed skiers and technical skiers in those events, as well as the elimination of two (St. Moritz, Davos) of the three parallels (and one of the team parallels (Lech/Zürs)) in favor of other races. Ultimately, only three of the races in this schedule -- one downhill, one Super-G, and one giant slalom -- were canceled during the season, as discussed later. \nIn addition to the disruption resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the season was interrupted by the 2021 World Ski Championships, which were held from 8–21 February in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\nThe last four events of the season were scheduled to take place at the World Cup finals, scheduled for Wednesday, 17 March through Sunday, 21 March in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. Only the top 25 in each specific discipline for the season and the winner of the Junior World Championship are eligible to compete in the finals, with the exception that athletes who have scored at least 500 points in the overall classification are eligible to participate in any discipline, regardless of standing in that discipline for the season. \nThe season championship was a battle between the two skiers with the most victories on the season (six): the technical ace Petra Vlhová from Slovakia (four slaloms, two giant slaloms) and the speed ace Lara Gut-Behrami from Switzerland (four Super-Gs, two downhills). Heading into the finals, Vlhová had a 93-point lead over Gut-Behrami. Since Gut-Behrami no longer skies in the slalom discipline due to a series of injuries, she needed a strong performance in the two speed races scheduled during the finals, in which she had a predicted advantage over Vlhová, to make up the gap. However, on 17 March, the downhill final (the first event in the finals) had to be cancelled after three days of heavy snowfall. On 18 March, the Super-G final was also cancelled, eliminating both speed finals and providing a distinct edge to a technical skier like Vlhová. And then the bad weather moved out before the slalom finals, and in the that final, Vlhová placed sixth, which gave her 40 points, enough to clinch overall victory before the giant slalom."

        "text": "Donald Thompson is a Canadian retired ice hockey forward who was an All-American for Michigan State.\nCareer.\nThompson briefly played for the Niagara Falls Flyers in 1968–69 but soon left the team so he could register as a freshman at Michigan State University. In doing so, he would be able to count the year as his freshman season and begin to play as a sophomore on the varsity squad in 1970. Shortly after Thompson joined Michigan State, the NCAA changed its long-standing police to limit student athletes to three seasons of varsity play. Beginning with the 1969–70 season, all incoming players had four years of eligibility. As a consequence, when Thompson was named as the WCHA Sophomore of the Year for 1970, he was the final player to receive that award.\nDespite the lost season, Thompson became a standout player for the Spartans in the early-1970s. He led the team in scoring in each of his three seasons with the club and was named an All-American in 1971. As a senior, he finished sixth in the nation in scoring. When Thompson graduated he was the Sparta's all-time leading scorer, however, nearly all of his records were surpassed due to the deluge of scoring that occurred in the mid-1970s.\nAfter college, Thompson played senior hockey briefly before becoming a beneficiary of the rapid expansion of professional hockey. Due to both the NHL's and WHA's demand for players, Thompson was able to sign a professional contract with the New Haven Nighthawks. He played parts of two seasons with the team, providing depth scoring and helping them reach the second round in 1974."

        "title": "List of Six Nations Championship Player of the Championship winners",
        "text": "The Six Nations Player of the Championship is a rugby union award given annually to the best-performing player in the Six Nations Championship. The accolade has been awarded since 2004. Recipients of the award are shortlisted by a panel made up from rugby writers, broadcasters and former players across the six participating nations, before being put forward to a public vote, where the player with the most votes is declared the winner. The Six Nations Team of the Championship is also included in this article. \nMethodology.\nThe methodology for the selection of shortlisting players and the number of players shortlisted has changed multiple times over the years. For the first couple of years, the vote was run by BBC Sport, whose panel of experts shortlisted the potential candidates that people voted for on the BBC Sport website. In 2006 and 2007, Six Nations Rugby took control of the voting and requested fans to select their dream team on their official website each weekend with the player that appeared more often within the fans dream teams over the weekends winning the title of player of the championship. From 2008 to 2010, an expert panel of former players from each of the six nations was reinstated to shortlist six candidates (as opposed to the usual 15–20 candidates that had been shortlisted in previous years) for the public vote. From 2011 to 2012, Six Nations Rugby changed how players were shortlisted by removing the expert panel and putting forward all players that had received the \"Player of the Match\" award from the host broadcaster of the matches within the first four rounds, which resulted in an increase in number of players shortlisted to 12. In 2013 and 2014, Six Nations Rugby together with their partners RBS and Accenture developed an algorithm to measure match stats and social media fan sentiment to rate players that would be shortlisted for the Player of the Championship, and they increased the number of players shortlisted to 15. In 2015, the measuring of social media fan sentiment to players was dropped as a criterion for shortlisting and the number of shortlisted candidates was reduced to 12. However, the panel of former rugby players was reinstated for a third time in 2016 and 2017, while retaining the number of 12 shortlisted players. From 2018 to 2020, the expert panel was made up of rugby writers, former players and broadcasters across the six participating nations and the number of shortlisted players was reduced to six. In 2021, the expert panel was made up of 12 Journalists and broadcasters, 2 from each of the participating six nations. Six Nations changed the method of shortlisting the candidates for 2024 Player of the Championship. Candidates were shortlisted based on been the most popular players selected by fans in their Team of the Championship. \nSix Nations Rugby introduced the Six Nations Team of the Championship in 2021, following on from many rugby media outlets that previously selected their preferred team of the Championships. Fans vote their preferred played for each position on the Six Nations Rugby website following the final game of the championship has been played. The players with the highest votes in each position make up the Six Nations Team of the Championship. A second-string team was also revealed by Six Nations Rugby in 2023."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Huskies represent the University of Connecticut in the NCAA Division I Big East Conference.\nUConn began competing in intercollegiate women's basketball in 1974, before the NCAA governed women's sports; in that era, the main governing body for women's college sports was the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW). The NCAA began governing women's sports in the 1981–82 school year; after one year in which both the NCAA and AIAW held national championship events, the AIAW folded. Because of UConn's relatively recent history in women's basketball, there is no \"pre-modern\" era of limited statistics; full box scores are available for all UConn games, and the only rules change that seriously impacted statistical totals was the advent of the three-pointer, which was made mandatory in NCAA women's basketball in the 1987–88 season.\nThe NCAA has recorded individual scoring and rebounding totals since it began sponsoring women's sports championships. However, it did not officially record the other statistics included in this page until later. Assists were first officially recorded in women's basketball in the 1985–86 season. Blocks and steals were first officially recorded in 1987–88, the same season in which the use of the three-pointer was made mandatory. UConn only includes three-point statistics since the national adoption of that rule, and only began recording steals in 1978–79, but otherwise includes statistics from the entire history of UConn women's basketball. These lists are updated through the end of the 2022–23 season.\nSteals.\nUConn did not begin recording steals until 1978, and lists only a top 5 in single-game steals instead of a top 10."

Going into the finals in Lenzerheide, Switzerland, after wins by Vlhová and Liensberger in back-to-back slaloms in Åre, Sweden, Vhlová had a 22-point lead on Liensberger and a 37-point lead on Shiffrin, with everyone else at least 180 points behind. However, in the season final, Liensberger posted the fastest time in both heats to defeat Shiffrin, who finished second, and win both the race and the season championship for the discipline. Liensberger thus became the first Austrian woman to win this discipline since Marlies Schild in 2011.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2021 World Ski Championships, which were held from 8–21 February in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.

In the first five rounds, each team had a shot rebound back off the crossbar—one by Jennifer Cudjoe for Gotham and one by Meghan Klingenberg for the Thorns. Both teams made their sixth-round shots, but in the seventh round, Nahomi Kawasumi of Gotham had her shot saved by Thorns goalkeeper Adrianna Franch. Morgan Weaver of the Thorns scored on her seventh-round attempt, winning the game and the 2021 Challenge Cup for Portland.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBroadcasting.\nThe match aired on CBS and Paramount+ in the United States, and on Twitch internationally. JP Dellacamera and Aly Wagner served as play-by-play announcer and analyst respectively on CBS, while Josh Eastern and Kaylyn Kyle did the same on Twitch. Marisa Pilla was the on-field reporter. CBS Sports soccer reporter Sandra Herrera and studio host Poppy Miller hosted the pre- and post-game shows on CBS Sports HQ along with Aly Wagner and Lori Lindsey."

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2021 NCAA Women's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) for the 2020–21 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. Both AP and USBWA choose three teams, while WBCA lists 10 honorees.\nA consensus All-America team in women's basketball has never been organized. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by AP, USBWA, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and \"Sporting News\" to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus All-America men's basketball team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. \"Sporting News\" does not select an All-America team in women's basketball.\nBy selector.\nAssociated Press (AP).\nAnnounced on March 17, 2021.\nUnited States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA).\nAnnounced on April 2, 2021.\nWomen's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA).\nAnnounced on April 3, 2021.\nAcademic All-Americans.\nThe College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) announced its 15-member 2021 Academic All-America team on May 28, 2021, divided into first, second and third teams, with Aliyah Boston of South Carolina chosen as women's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year, also becoming the first sophomore so honored in D-I women's basketball.\nSenior All-Americans.\nThe 10 finalists for the Senior CLASS Award, called Senior All-Americans, were announced on February 22, 2021. Rennia Davis of Tennessee was named the recipient on April 2, with the first and second teams also being announced at that time."

        "text": "Shane Wright (born January 5, 2004) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre for the Coachella Valley Firebirds of the American Hockey League (AHL) as a prospect to the Seattle Kraken of the National Hockey League (NHL). Projected as the likely first overall pick leading up to the 2022 NHL Entry draft, Wright was selected fourth overall by the Seattle Kraken.\nInternationally, Wright won gold as a member of Canada national under-18 team at the 2021 IIHF World U18 Championships and Canada national junior team at the 2023 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nKingston Frontenacs (2019–2023).\nWright was granted exceptional player status for the 2019–20 season, becoming the sixth player to be granted exceptional status. The preceding five players were John Tavares, Aaron Ekblad, Connor McDavid, Sean Day and Joe Veleno.\nWright was drafted by the Kingston Frontenacs with the first overall selection in the 2019 OHL Priority Selection. On September 20, 2019, Wright made his OHL debut at the age of 15, as he was held to no points in a 4–1 loss to the Oshawa Generals. One week later, on September 27, Wright scored the first OHL goal in his career against Andrew MacLean of the Oshawa Generals in a 4–1 loss. On October 4, Wright had his first career multi-point game in his OHL career, scoring a goal and adding an assist in an 8–4 loss to the Niagara IceDogs. Wright recorded his first multi-goal game on October 11, as he scored twice, including the overtime winning goal, in a 4–3 victory over the Niagara IceDogs. On December 30, the Frontenacs named Wright an alternate captain of the team, as he became the youngest team captain in CHL history. On February 29, Wright recorded his first career OHL hat trick, as he scored three goals and added an assist for a career-high four points in a game in a 6–1 win over the Flint Firebirds. Wright finished the 2019–20 season with 39 goals and 66 points in 58 games. Wright was named the winner of the Emms Family Award for OHL Rookie of the Year.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020–21 season was cancelled, leaving Wright without a league to play in. His only competitive hockey in that span was an appearance at the 2021 IIHF World U18 Championships.\nWright returned to the Frontenacs for the 2021–22 season. On October 8, 2021, he was named captain of the team, making him the youngest captain in OHL history. Expectations were high based on his rookie season, his performance internationally, and his presumptive status as the first overall pick in the NHL draft, but the season began with only 22 points in 19 games in his first two months. Many attributed this in part to the loss of the prior OHL season. However, he was widely credited with taking major strides in performance for the remainder. Wright finished the regular season with 32 goals and 62 assists, the former less than in his debut season, the latter a significant increase. The Frontenacs qualified for the OHL playoffs, and faced the Oshawa Generals in the first round. Wright scored the series-winning goal in overtime of Game 6 to eliminate the Generals and advance to the second round. The Frontenacs were eliminated by the North Bay Battalion in the second round, concluding his season.\nAfter spending the fall of 2022 playing variously in the NHL, the AHL, and the World Junior Championships, Wright was sent back to the OHL by the Kraken management for the second half of the 2022–23 season. With the Frontenacs not considered to be a competitive team, it was widely speculated that he would soon be traded to another team in advance of the OHL's trade deadline for the OHL playoffs, with teams such as the Ottawa 67's, London Knights, Barrie Colts, and Peterborough Petes rumoured to be interested.\nWindsor Spitfires (2023).\nDespite rumours that placed the London Knights as frontrunners to secure Wright in trade, on January 9, 2023, he was traded to the Windsor Spitfires in exchange for Ethan Miedema, Gavin McCarthy, five draft picks, and two additional conditional draft picks. This trade was the last of a series of transactions by the Spitfires, the defending OHL Western Conference champions, in advance of the 2023 playoffs. Windsor general manager Bill Bowler said that \"anytime you get the captain of the gold-medal winning Team Canada junior team is a great day for the organization and the City of Windsor.\"\nWright played twenty games in the regular season, notching 15 goals and 22 assists, while the Spitfires finished first in the Western Conference and entered their first round playoff series against the Kitchener Rangers as the top seed. Wright managed one goal and two assists in four playoff games, before the Spitfires were upset in a sweep by the Rangers.\nProfessional.\n2022 NHL Entry Draft.\nConsidered the presumptive first overall pick in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft at the start of the season, Wright's status began to be called into question by the midpoint of the 2021–22 season, with many scouts saying that he had \"left the door open for someone to unseat him.\" As the draft approached, debate largely focused on the merits of Wright versus Slovak winger Juraj Slafkovský of Liiga's TPS. The first overall pick was won by the Montreal Canadiens, whose general manager, Kent Hughes, confirmed days before the draft that the choice was between Wright, Slafkovský, and Logan Cooley of the USNTDP. Ultimately the Canadiens used the first overall pick to select Slafkovský, the New Jersey Devils selected Šimon Nemec second and the Arizona Coyotes selected Cooley third, giving the Seattle Kraken an opportunity to draft Wright with the fourth overall pick. He remarked afterward that he was \"definitely gonna have a chip on my shoulder\" as to being passed over by the first three teams.\nSeattle Kraken (2022–present).\nOn July 13, 2022, Wright signed a three-year entry level contract with the Kraken worth $2.85 million over three years. Kraken general manager Ron Francis stated that he believed Wright would likely play the season with the Kraken. He played 6:14 in his NHL debut on October 12 in a 5–4 overtime loss to the Anaheim Ducks. Following his debut, Wright was a healthy scratch for the following two games before returning to the lineup on October 17. He recorded his first NHL point, an assist, in an October 19 overtime loss to the St. Louis Blues. As October concluded, coach Dave Hakstol's usage of Wright became a major source of debate in the media and among fans, as he was frequently scratched and being played for less than seven minutes per game on average when allowed into the lineup. Following five straight games as a healthy scratch, the Kraken exploited a loophole in league rules to send Wright to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Coachella Valley Firebirds, on a conditioning stint. This bypassed the requirement Wright be returned to major junior. After scoring four goals in five AHL games, he returned to the Kraken lineup on December 6, scoring his first career NHL goal in a 4–2 loss against the Canadiens, a result widely called \"poetic.\" After spending time competing with Canada national junior team, the Kraken returned Wright to the OHL. In April 2023, Wright was re-assigned to the Firebirds after the Windsor Spitfires were eliminated from the OHL playoffs. He participated in the Firebirds' deep run to the finals of the 2023 Calder Cup playoffs, where they lost to the Hershey Bears in seven games. Wright recorded two goals and seven assists in 24 AHL playoff games.\nInternational play.\nWright made his international debut with Canada national under-18 team at the 2021 IIHF World U18 Championships, finishing second in the tournament scoring race and scoring two goals in the final against Russia national under-18 team to help win the gold medal. Later in the year he was selected for Canada national junior team for the 2022 World Junior Championships, but was only able to play two games before the tournament was cancelled due to the Omicron variant. Wright expressed \"shock and disappointment\". Wright did not play in the rescheduled event, held in August 2022.\nWright was loaned by the Seattle Kraken to Canada's junior team in advance of the 2023 World Junior Championships. On December 18, 2022, he was named captain of the team for the tournament, which he called a \"true honour.\" During the tournament he recorded four goals and three assists in seven games, winning a gold medal with the team. He was widely praised for his performance in the gold medal game against Czech national junior team, which occurred on his birthday."

Seve Ballesteros made the cut with one stroke margin in the rainy conditions which turned the course muddy and slippery. In 1996 Lee Westwood finished on 281 (–11) to secure his first European Tour victory after Paul Broadhurst was eliminated by par on first extra hole, and he won over Russell Claydon when he holed a 40-foot putt for birdie on the second extra hole. Colin Montgomerie, John Daly and Bernhard Langer all finished outside the top ten."

        "text": "Reunion Golf and Country Club is a country club and neighborhood in Madison, Mississippi. The facility includes sports such as tennis, golf, and swimming.\nHistory.\nThe country club's land was first settled in the 1800s by John Taylor Johnstone, who immigrated from North Carolina and established several forced-labor farms. He apparently was \"reminded\" of Scotland when he settled the land.\nIn the 1990s, David H. Nutt, an attorney and now richest person in Mississippi, acquired 2,100 acres of land on what used to be Johnstone's estate. The first homes were built in the 2000s, and the first clubhouse was built in 2004.\nIn 2006, Reunion's administration started plans for a bigger, more luxurious clubhouse. Multiple changes were made to the plans, and construction began in 2015. Its inspiration was Annandale Home, which now serves as Reunion Hall, locally known as the \"White House\". The Reunion Property Owners' Association is headquartered there. Annandale Hall was built in the late 1800s, for the aforementioned Johnstone family. It was burned down in 1920, and was rebuilt thereafter.\nGolf course.\nReunion's 18-hole, par-72 golf course was designed by Bob Cupp in 2004. Its fairways are made by TifEagle and its greens are made by TifSport. The club has also installed a set of US Kids Family tees on the course.\nOther sports.\nFor tennis, Reunion has nine Har-Tru clay courts that are open for day and night play. Reunion is also the host of seven JLTA teams, more than 15 social mixers, three sanctioned junior tournaments, and more. Reunion's swimming pool is next to the clubhouse."

After the restart, the field remained close together coming out of the water. In the cycling leg, a group of 10 broke away for the first few laps but the chasing pack eventually reeled them by the end of the fifth lap to form a lead group of 37 triathletes. On the last lap, Andrea Salvisberg broke away solo to lead by 16 seconds heading into the second transition, but he was caught by the rest of the field on the first lap of the running leg. The lead group remained together until the end of the third lap, when Alex Yee, Kristian Blummenfelt, and Hayden Wilde surged ahead. In the final mile, Blummenfelt accelerated away from the other two to take the gold medal. Yee finished 11 seconds later to take the silver, with Wilde completing the podium a further nine seconds back.\nCourse.\nThe event took place at the Odaiba Marine Park and was long along a flat course.

After distancing herself from Zaferes early on during the running leg, Duffy won the race and became Bermuda's first Olympic gold medalist. Taylor-Brown, who had suffered a puncture late in the cycling leg, passed several competitors during the running leg to finish second, over a minute behind Duffy, and claim the silver medal, while Zaferes hung on to complete the podium and claim the bronze medal.\nCourse.\nThe event took place at the Odaiba Marine Park in Tokyo Bay, and was long, the \"standard\" or \"Olympic\" distance for a triathlon. Competitors began with a swimming leg, consisting of a lap followed by a shorter lap. Then, they took on the cycling leg, which covered eight laps of a course. Finally, competitors finished with four laps of a course that made up the running leg. Between each leg, there was also a transition zone in which competitors must change equipment and clothing for the next leg.\nSummary.\nThere were 55 competitors entered into the triathlon, but only 54 started the event; Ukraine's Yuliya Yelistratova did not start after being provisionally suspended. The field included then-reigning world champion Georgia Taylor-Brown of Great Britain, and her three immediate predecessors to that title, 2019 champion Katie Zaferes of the United States, 2018 world champion and compatriot Vicky Holland, and 2016 and 2017 champion Flora Duffy of Bermuda. American Gwen Jorgensen, who won the 2016 Olympic event, was not in the field to defend her title, having retired from the sport to focus on running, but her fellow podium finishers from 2016, silver medalist Holland and bronze medalist Switzerland's Nicola Spirig, both competed.\nHeavy rain in the hours before the race delayed the start by at least fifteen minutes, and conditions remained wet during the race. On the first lap of the swimming leg, Jessica Learmonth of Great Britain established the pace. A lead group quickly formed in the water, with Learmonth followed closely by Americans Zaferes and Summer Rappaport, Vittoria Lopes of Brazil, Laura Lindemann of Germany, and Taylor-Brown. At the end of the swimming leg, the lead group of seven had built up an advantage of at least 30 seconds on the rest of the field, which was led out of the water by Emma Jeffcoat of Australia. At the end of the first cycling lap, the leaders' advantage had grown to over a minute ahead of a chase group of 14 that included Spirig, Holland, and the Dutch duo of Maya Kingma and Rachel Klamer. A lack of organization in the chase group left Spirig to lead the chase and reduce the deficit, but with little success. On the next lap, the chase group was reduced to 12, while Rappaport and Lopes were dropped from the lead group on the fourth and sixth laps, respectively. A puncture for Taylor-Brown near the end of the cycling leg saw her cede 20 seconds to the other four leaders heading into the second transition.\nDuffy and Zaferes led at the start of the running leg, but by the end of the second lap, the Bermudian began to distance herself. Behind, Taylor-Brown overtook first Lindemann and then Learmonth before passing Zaferes with one lap to go. With a lead of over a minute, Duffy was able to celebrate her victory as she ran down the finishing straight, becoming Bermuda's first Olympic gold medalist. Taylor-Brown and Zaferes both finished over a minute behind Duffy but held on for the silver and bronze medals, respectively, while Lindemann and Learmonth were caught and passed by the faster runners of the chase group."

        "text": "The 1936 Auckland Rugby League season was its 28th. The Fox Memorial was won by Manukau in their first season back in the senior A grade as a stand-alone club since the early 1910s. They also won the Roope Rooster competition when they defeated City Rovers 23 to 10 in the final. Richmond Rovers finished runners up in the Fox Memorial and earned the right to play Manukau for the Stormont Shield. Richmond won the trophy after beating Manukau 30–9 in the Stormont Shield clash. Richmond also won the Phelan Shield after they had been knocked out of the Roope Rooster in the first round. They beat Marist Old Boys 13–9 in the final.\nBy accumulating the most points in the second round of the Fox competition Ponsonby United won the Thistle Cup. Mount Albert United won the senior reserve championship (Norton Cup) which was the first senior title in their history. Marist won the reserve grade knockout competition (Stallard Cup). The senior B grade (Sharman Cup) was won by Papakura who went unbeaten throughout the season. They also won the Walmsley Shield by going unbeaten in the extra round played for that trophy. Point Chevalier won the senior B knockout competition after they defeated Green Lane 22–9 in the final.\nAuckland played 3 representative fixtures with the first 2 played on the same day, when they fielded 2 teams against separate opponents. The opposition was Tāmaki (Auckland Māori) who they lost to 30–21, and Wellington who they beat 25–22. The highlight of their season was the match against the touring Great Britain played in front of 14,000 at Carlaw Park. Great Britain had recently spent 8 weeks in Australia where they won the test series 2–1 and 14 of their 17 tour matches. Auckland played well but went down 16–22.\nAside from their match with Auckland, the Tāmaki (Auckland Māori) team played Waikato Māori on June 15 and lost 30–43 at Te Kohanga, and had a win over Northland Māori (Takahiwai) 39–15 in a match for the Waitangi Shield. Jack Hemi, the New Zealand Māori rugby representative had switched codes and played all 3 matches for them. They were scheduled to play a fourth match against Waikato Māori for the Waitangi Shield but owing to the awful weather around that time, and the desire to protect the Carlaw Park surface from any further damage before the touring Great Britain sides matches the game was cancelled.\n \n \nAuckland Rugby League meetings and news.\nAnnual meeting.\nOn February 26 the ARL met to discuss several issues and to decide on an approximate date for the annual meeting. It was recommended to play a benefit match for Jim Laird of the Marist Old Boys who had been in hospital suffering from a leg injury since the New Zealand – Australia match late in the previous season. It was also stressed that the percentage of money earned given to clubs should increase so that they can promote increased organisation in the sport. Mr. D. Wilkie said it was felt that senior clubs were not catering sufficiently for juniors and the junior board considered that the constitution should compel each club to have at least three junior teams. On March 25 at a board of control meeting several clubs were reported to have altered their uniforms following last year's official suggestion due to colour clashes in many matches.\nThe annual general meeting was held on April 6. Mr. G. Grey Campbell stated that \"if the rugby league public, clubs and players were enthusiastic last year, they are now more than doubly so; in fact, abounding with a confidence that augurs well for the approaching season\". Mr. Harold Walmsley was in attendance and was thanked for his generosity with rugby league for many years and for donating his 21st trophy to the game which would be known as the Tracy Inglis football. Dr. Inglis had been associated with the game as a prominent medical officer. It was later decided to allocate the trophy as an award for junior clubs only for competition on similar lines to the Davis Points Shield.\nThe following officers were elected to the board:- Patron, Mr. J.B. Donald; vice-patron, Mr. J.F.W. Dickson; president, John A. Lee (M.P.); vice presidents, Messrs. E. Davis, R.D. Bagnall, J. Bellamy, R. Benson, O. Blackwood, John Donald, C. Drysdale, H. Grange, R.J. Laird, W.J. Lovett, E. Montgomery, T.G. Symonds, Joe Sayegh, C. Seagar, Bill Schram (M.P.), W. Wallace, H. Walmsley, R.H. Wood, G.T. Wright, and H.W. Brien; chairman, Mr. G. Grey Campbell; vice-chairman, Ted Phelan; club delegates on the control board, Messrs. Jim Rukutai and J.W. Probert; referee delegate, Mr. W. Mincham; junior board delegate, Mr. D. Wilkie. At the meeting of the control board which followed the following appointments were confirmed:- Hon. secretary, Mr. Ivan Culpan; hon. treasurer, Mr. J.E. Knowling; hon. solicitor, Mr. H.M. Rogerson; hon. Physicians, Drs. Tracy Inglis, M.G. Pezaro, F.J. Gwynne, K.H. Holdgate, J.N. Waddell, H. Burrell and G.W. Lock; hon. masseur, Mr. F. Flanagan; auditor, Mr. R.A. Spinley; Press steward, Mr. R. Doble; referees' appointment board delegate, Mr. L. Binns; New Zealand Council delegate, Mr. R. Doble; finance committee, the chairman, secretary and Messrs. J.W. Probert and W. Mincham; insurance committee, Messrs. Doble, Binns and D Wilkie; emergency committee, chairman, secretary and Mr. Jim Rukutai; grounds chairman, secretary and Mr. Binns.\nThe gross receipts were £3,298 13s 9d and were an increase of £500 on the previous season. During the season ground rents due to the hire of Carlaw Park were increased by £71 17s 6d. Players benefited by insurance to the extent of £70 17s. The greatest increase in expenditure was maintenance of Carlaw Park, which amounted to £353 6s 6d. A sum of £520 was granted to senior clubs as gate percentages, which was a record since clubs had benefited from such payments.\nIt was decided to begin the season on the 18th of April and a \"substantial portion\" of the gate would be donated to Jim Laird, the Marist player who was still recovering from an injury received playing for New Zealand the previous season. Senior premiership matches would start on May 2. On September 12 during the break between Roope Rooster games at Carlaw Park John A. Lee was presented with a silver mounted oak inkstand by officials of Auckland Rugby League. Lee was an M.P. and was being elevated to Parliamentary Under-Secretary in charge of the State housing scheme. This required him to spend a lot more time in Wellington and he would be relinquishing the presidency of Auckland Rugby League at the end of the season. Lee said \"I love the game and I like the people associated with it\"... \"what ever can do for the league code will be done, not because of politics, but because I love league football\". Ivan Culpan was then presented with a dressing table set for his work making all the ground arrangements at Carlaw Park throughout the recent English tour. Mr. Culpan said that his work for the league since he became secretary in 1918 had been his hobby.\nHonours board.\nAt the annual meeting on April 6 it was decided to compile and hang and honours board at the ARL head office. It would include the names of all \"living officials who have a record of 25 years and over in the service of the code in Auckland\". Those present at the meeting who would qualify were William Mincham, Messrs. E.K. Asher (City Rovers) and A. Ferguson (Devonport), 27 years; Jim Rukutai (control board) and William James Liversidge (NZ Council), 26 years; Ivan Culpan (ARL secretary), and Pro. Henry (Newton Rangers), 25 years. The board was being donated by Mr. R.H. Wood who was thanked at a board of control meeting on April 15. It was decided to write to all clubs asking them to \"supply the names of members or officials who have 25 years' record of active connection with the game in playing and official capacity\".\nCarlaw Park.\nAt the February 26 meeting of the ARL the board agreed to erect higher goal posts at Carlaw Park. They also decided to make permanent accommodation there for the Mount Albert United Club. Chairman Campbell at the pre-season ARL meeting said that the ground space had extended the ground space by 12 feet in width by the setting back of the picket fence at the foot of the terrace which meant \"the danger of players being thrown against the terrace fence had been greatly minimised\". They had also formed steps behind the stand leading to the hill. The turf has also been top dressed, and made more even than it had formerly been. It was also discussed that a round of night games in early April could be played and this was supported by several delegates. A by-law had come into place whereby \"theatres and other places of amusement capable of seating 500 or more people\" would have to have firemen in attendance. In the past the by-law did not operate in regards to sports organisations. From May 1 firemen would be supplied directly by the Auckland Metropolitan Fire Board. New Zealand was transitioning to a 40-hour work week meaning that many people would no longer be working half days on Saturday. Mr. G. Grey Campbell said if Saturday were a universal holiday the league would \"undoubtedly take full advantage of it. Reserve grade games might well be played in the morning. Furthermore, opportunity could be taken to have senior B matches played on Saturday morning at Carlaw Park\" which had been a difficulty up to this point. The grounds executive submitted a report to the board that a start had been made by May 20 on the formation of tea rooms near the grandstand as part of the programme of improvements in preparation for the visit of the British team. It was reported at the May 27 meeting of the board of control that Mr. Early had donated a board for display at Carlaw Park which would show the senior team placings in the competition from week to week. It was reported at the same meeting that after 4 rounds the gate takings were far in excess of anything since 1931. It was decided at a meeting on June 1 to purchase special whistles for referees on the #2 field because there was sometimes confusion when a whistle was blown as to which field it related to.\nSenior team prospects for the season.\nOn April 13 the Auckland Star reported on various teams prospects for the season. The New Zealand Herald did the same on April 29. Marist had secured Mr. Con Hall as selector/coach to replace Charles Gregory. Gregory was moving to an outer district and would not be able to do commute. Hall had been a national selector the previous season and was leaving the West Coast. They would still have Dan Keane, Joe Woods, Herb Carter, Bill Breed (formerly of Otahuhu Rovers), and hooker Jim O'Kane, with John Anderson the West Coast Rugby League representative forward joining their ranks. Norm Campbell, Vincent Bakalich, Sidney Loader, Arthur Furlonger, George Kerr, James Chalmers and William Glover would also be on hand to play in the backs. Robert (Bob) Aro was joining them from the Technical Old Boys rugby club.\nRichmond Rovers were losing Bert Cooke who was retiring and moving to coach Ponsonby United. They were acquiring George Tittleton, the international player from the Waikato along with his brother Walter who had also debuted for New Zealand in the first test against Australia in 1935. They would play alongside Eric Fletcher and Roy Powell with Ted Mincham, Alf Mitchell, E McNeil and Noel Bickerton also in the backs. The forwards were rumoured to see Bill Telford, the Satherley brothers (Jack and Cliff), Alfred Broadhead, Harold Tetley and Ray Lawless along with Hermes Hadley who was returning from the Foster Club in Australia. Though Lawless did not play in 1936.\nCity Rovers would again be led by outstanding New Zealand player Lou Brown. City were adding former South Auckland rugby union hooker Lapwood to the forwards where he would join Stan Clark, James Herring, William McLaughlan, James Dye, Steve Watene, John Magee, and Bowman. Harry Wayne was returning from Taranaki (though he a short time later moved to South Africa), and Jackie Rata was joining from South Auckland rugby (Tuakau) along with T Allen, the Waikato rugby fullback. Ex-Wairarapa player Ford was also expected to join City's ranks. Cyril Wiberg, Jack Tawhai, Arnold Porteous, Herbert Thompson were likely to make up the backs. Arnold Porteous was moving across from the Marist rugby side, though he had previously played for Newton Rangers.\nNewton Rangers, holders of the Roope Rooster trophy were confident of success and would be wearing new uniforms supplied by the St Helens club in England via former players who were playing there. Claude Dempsey would be in the backs again along with Pat Young, the Brimble brothers (Ted and Wilfred), Frederick Sissons (promoted from the juniors), H. Brady, and Schlesinger. Knott from the Ponsonby rugby team was also joining the backs. In the forwards R.A. Johnson, Ray Middleton, A. Nathan, Clemm, Watson and Reginald Kelsall would play, with John Ginders transferring from Richmond with Lou Hutt joining from Ponsonby. Emanuel, Merrick (returning from North Auckland), and Mackin would also be in the forward pack with a brother of Mount Albert's Richard Shadbolt joining. Watson from Northern Wairoa rugby and a Hawke's Bay representative would be another addition to the pack.\nMount Albert performed brilliantly in their first ever season in the season finishing runners-up. Tom Haddon was selector again and it was understood that international player T. Campbell would lead the reserve grade side. H Flannagan, Des Herring, Constable, Joseph Gunning and Richard Shadbolt would be in the forwards again with Peterson, the Hawke's Bay rugby representative joining the loose forwards. Other players joining Mount Albert included Elwin from Manukau rugby, J. O'Brien from South Auckland (Waikato) along with \"several others\". They had also gained the services of Watkins' the Grafton rugby halfback. Len Schultz was re-joining the side from York in England with Pawson rumoured to be joining from South Auckland. Bert Schultz would play on one wing with Ray Halsey joining from the Otahuhu senior B side. Robert Morrissey would again be in the fullback position.\nPonsonby were being coached by Bert Cooke. Arthur Kay, Brian Riley and Frank Halloran would again be in the backs. Devonport United were rumoured to be gathering their best team for several years and had former New Zealand international Bert Laing in charge of their senior side. Edgar Morgan who had played for Grammar Old Boys was also changing codes as was Davis, from the Grafton club, he had been a member of the Auckland B team. Dreaver and Blood were also named as two promising young forwards. Another player to switch codes and join Ponsonby was Frank Paton.\nDevonport saw the return of backs C Rhodes, J C Cowan, Cliff Hall, and Len Scott. They were being strengthened by the inclusion of Gordon, a junior rugby five-eighth. Kennedy, J Greenwood and Parkinson were also joining the side from the rugby ranks. In the forwards Reg Hallows was another rugby convert from Northland and was joining first team regulars John Donald, Hugh Simpson, Horace Hunt, Tony Milicich, Arthur Sowter, and E Scott.\nNon-replacement rule.\nFollowing a decision by the New Zealand Council that the non-replacement rule be enforced the Auckland Rugby League was forced to adhere to it more stringently. Previously teams would be allowed to replace an injured player in the first half but the rule was now being brought into line with the way it was enforced in England where no player may be replaced at all. Considerable debate took place at the meeting with Jim Rukutai and Mr. J.W. Probert saying that \"the present rule allowing replacements up to half-time seemed to be working well\". Rukutai said that \"the enforcement of the rule might spoil matters and be a handicap\". Mr. Doble said that the enforcement of the rule might \"do considerable good and compel increased fitness by players and teams\". Chairman Campbell said it would be unfair to \"spring the rules on the clubs Saturday\", so it was decided to bring the rule in for the round 4 matches the week after. At the May 20 meeting of the control board four clubs (Newton Rangers, Ponsonby United, Devonport United, and Marist Old Boys) all wrote letters strongly opposing the rule. The other clubs were also against the rule, as were the schools' management and the junior control board. All who spoke were in agreement that the league could use its discretion and not apply the rule to club competition and that the rule should only be used for representative matches. Mr. Doble suggested that they trial the rule that weekend and then apply for dispensation but chairman Campbell said that \"the risk of upsetting the games and the public was too great. It was preferable in the circumstances to offend the council than for games to be spoilt for the public through becoming one-sided as the result of any injury to players\". It was then decided to rescind the rule change.\nAdmission of Manukau Rovers club into the senior competition.\nAt the ARL control board meeting on April 29 the Manukau Rovers were admitted to the senior championship first grade competition. This was their first appearance in it since 1913 though they did field a combined team with a Mangere club in 1924 before switching en masse to the rugby code the same year. In 1932 the club was revived but mainly fielded teams in the junior grades. Jack Hemi and Joe Broughton left the rugby union code where they were playing for Wairarapa, and Horowhenua - Manawatu respectively and joined the Manukau club prior to the start of the season. Both were representative players with Hemi also having played for the Maori All Blacks. Thomas Trevarthan then joined the team for their second round match. Trevarthan was a rugby player from Otago and he went on the represent New Zealand in his debut league season. In addition Len Kawe, Angus Gault, and Frank Pickrang all King County rugby representatives joined Manukau early in the season. Towards the end of the season Manukau signed Jack Brodrick who was honoured with the best forward award following the New Zealand Maori rugby union tour of Australia. Tragedy struck Manukau immediately following their first win of the season against Richmond in round 2. Mr. Albert Cowan, who had founded the team joined them in the dressing room to congratulate them but collapsed and could not be revived. The players and patrons were \"distressed when the news was confirmed, and flags lowered to half-mast. The Manukau reserve team which was playing a later game at the Domain found out during their match which was then abandoned.\nJunior insurance scheme.\nA compulsory junior insurance scheme, controlled by the ARL was to be brought in for the 1936 season. Mr. Wilkie said that clubs had been involved in its idea and implementation. It would involve an increase in the player registration fee and see insurance and the first doctor's expenses met.\nBroadcasting of matches.\nIt was decided to continue broadcasting matches prior to the commencement of the season. On May 30 (round 5) the first of the matches was broadcast on 1ZB. The Friendly Road station had been off air for some time for \"urgent repairs and overhaul\". \"Griffo\", who was the station's sports announcer, was to be the commentator.\nAnnual prize-giving.\nOn the 16th of November the Auckland Rugby League held their annual prize giving at the Auckland Town Hall. Mr. E.J. Phelan congratulated the players and officials on the season and paid tribute to the championship winning Manukau side. Mr. G. Grey Campbell said that it was a pleasure to be associated with the clubs this season and thanked the control board for the \"earnest co-operation of club officials [and that] the valuable assistance rendered by the ladies' committee was a feature of the successful social side of the Auckland League's activities. Mr. Phelan then presented the trophies and caps won by teams and players.\nObituaries.\nArthur Singe.\nArthur Singe played for Marist Old Boys in 1921, and again from 1924 to 1926 after a spell out of Auckland for work. He made 48 appearances for them in total and scored 140 points from 22 tries and 37 goals. Singe originally played rugby union, representing the Marist Old Boys rugby club after returning from World War 1. He had represented the New Zealand Army side which played a large number of games in Europe late in the war and after it had ceased. Singe was a fast wing forward who was regularly hailed as a \"match winner\" and widely considered to be a brilliant footballer. He toured South Africa with the NZ Army side on their way back to New Zealand in 1919. In 1920 Singe represented Auckland at rugby in 8 matches along with 1 appearance for the North Island side, and was considered unlucky not to make the New Zealand team. Soon after missing selection he switched to rugby league. He represented Auckland 15 times from 1921 to 1926. Singe was selected to play for New Zealand in 1925 against the touring Queensland side, and was then chosen for the ill-fated 1926–27 tour of England and Wales. Singe was part of a group of players who refused to play at two points of the tour due to their objection to the selections and coaching of Ernest Mair. Upon his return he, along with the other strikers was banned from rugby league for life. Singe had received a life ban from rugby union for switching to rugby league and so could no longer play in either code. In 1962 the New Zealand Rugby League administration lifted the ban on Singe and his 6 teammates however Singe had been dead for 26 years by this time. Singe died on January 5, 1936, after suffering ill health likely related to the war and was buried at Waikumete Cemetery.\nThomas Wells.\nThomas (William Godfrey) Wells had arrived in Auckland around 1929 and became a delegate for the Parnell club on their junior and senior management committees of the ARL. He was killed in a motorcycle accident on Franklin Road, Ponsonby on March 14 when his motorcycle veered off the road and crashed into a tree. He \"received the full force of the impact on his head\", and was taken away in an ambulance to Auckland Hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival. He was married with no children and aged just 36. He was buried at Hillsborough Cemetery on March 17.\nAlbert Cowan.\nOn May 9 Mr. Albert Askin Cowan collapsed and died in the Manukau dressing room following their win against Richmond at Carlaw Park. He was a founder of the Manukau side and their secretary, and was absolutely instrumental along with Puti Tipene Watene in the rebuilding of the club in recent seasons. He had been a \"keen stalwart of the rugby league code for many years, and was responsible for the organisation of the Ellerslie United and Otahuhu Rovers clubs when Ellerslie attained senior rank\". He was also a member of the Manukau Cruising Club. Mr. Cowan was born in Port Chalmers in 1880, and resided at Selwyn Street, South Onehunga. He was \"survived by Mrs. Cowan, a son who is an invalid and two daughters\". He was 57 years of age. Cowan's funeral was held on the morning of May 12 in Onehunga at the Church of the Assumption. Over 50 vehicles made up the cortege with the pall-bearers Messrs, G. Love, Angus Gault, Steve Watene, and G. Zanovich. All sections of the Auckland Rugby League were represented, including Mr. G. Grey Campbell and E.J. Phelan.\nJohn Stormont.\nJohn Stormont died in September. He was a trustee of Auckland Rugby League for 8 years and was a part donor of the Stormont Memorial Shield in honour of his son who played for the New Zealand side and died aged 26 from rheumatic heart disease in 1925. When news reached the meeting of the ARL Mr. Campbell said \"the passing of such a widely respected citizen and trustee of the game in this city would be widely deplored. John Stormont was aged 73 and was survived by his wife and seven sons.\nSpecial opening matches.\nOn April 18 a special round of matches were played to open the season. The proceeds were divided between the clubs and a benefit fund for Jim Laird, the Marist international player who was injured in a New Zealand match late in the 1935 season. In the match between Richmond and Mount Albert, a Richmond forward was ordered off (though the newspapers did not state who the player was) and was suspended for four weeks. There were four matches played at Carlaw Park. The Manukau senior side had yet to be admitted at this point and so Devonport played the Pukemiro team from the South Auckland league. The same weekend Papakura defeated Point Chevalier in a pre-season match at Papakura by 38 points to 5. Former rugby representative player, Reginald Haslam was on debut for Marist after switching codes. He would represent Auckland in a match later in the season.\nMatches.\nThe match between Marist and Newton was refereed by Percy Rogers who was refereeing at least his 100th senior grade match since his debut in 1924. James Dye of the City side received a bad head injury and was taken to Auckland Hospital suffering from concussion. He was able to return to work on the Tuesday. For Richmond in their match with Mount Albert, Ronald Couper injured his knee which had previously caused him trouble.\nFox Memorial Shield (senior championship).\nFox Memorial results.\nRound 1.\nThe round 1 matches were played at Carlaw Park in rain with occasional hail. There was some controversy at the end of the match between Marist and City. Sidney Loader scored a try for Marist with time up but the ball was still in play which won them the match. City protested the result believing too much time had been played but the time keeper gave a detailed description of why time had been added and City accepted the result. Manukau in their first game in the senior A grade for decades played well in the first half and only trailed 3–2 at half time before falling away and losing 27–2.\nRound 2.\nFollowing the Manukau win over Richmond, Mr. Albert Cowan, one of the founders of the Manukau senior side entered their dressing room to congratulate the team. Whilst there he suffered a fatal heart attack and was unable to be revived. The 3pm kickoff games were underway and the flags were lowered to half mast. News of his death reached the nearby Domain where the reserve matches were taking place. Upon hearing of his death the Manukau reserve team game was stopped. During Manukau's game at Carlaw Park international Cliff Satherley was concussed and taken to Auckland Hospital.\nRound 3.\nNew Zealand international Eric Fletcher had to leave the field for Richmond with a foot injury. It was to be his last ever appearance in rugby league as he moved back to Palmerston North and was reinstated to rugby union. He finished the season playing several matches for Manawatu before retiring and taking up representative golf. His younger brother Keith joined the Richmond senior side soon afterwards.\nRound 6.\nThe City v Mount Albert match was played at Prince Edward Park in Papakura. Pawson left the field during the match with an ankle injury and then Harry Halliwell was knocked out by a late tackle in the first half and was unconscious for \"three quarters of an hour\". Jack Hemi injured his knee playing for Manukau and had to leave the field. The injury saw him miss several weeks.\nRound 8.\nAfter a remarkable -year absence, former Kiwi Craddock Dufty turned out for City at the age of 36. He scored 47 points over the remainder of the season which meant he was the 6th highest point scorer for the season. During the Manukau and Devonport match George Kerr had to leave the field with 15 minutes remaining with a leg injury. For Ponsonby Payne was carried from the field near fulltime with a side injury.\nRound 9.\nAngus Gault was concussed whilst playing for Manukau against Richmond and was taken to hospital.\nRound 10.\nFred Moate debuted for Manukau. It was his first game of rugby league as he had switched codes, previously represented East Coast in rugby union and was a five-eighth out of the Waima Rugby Club. In the final minute of the game he beat 4 defenders to score with Watene's conversion giving Manukau the win. Craddock Dufty had the unique feat of scoring a try, kicking 3 conversions, a penalty, and a drop goal. All four ways of securing points.\nRound 11.\nFollowing the Devonport v Newton match A. Nathan of the Newton side was involved in an \"incident\" in the dressing room area and as a result was suspended for the remainder of the season and all of the 1937 season. The other player involved from Devonport (who was never named) was \"exonerated\". Over the coming months the Newton club appealed the suspension to both the ARL and the New Zealand Council but the suspension was upheld. Conditions were atrocious for all of the games but by the time of the 3pm kickoffs the fields were covered in mud and water. In the Ponsonby v Mount Albert match the referee stopped the game to admit that he could not tell the teams apart so requested that they stay onside. Players were even running off the field to wash their eyes in buckets of water.\nRound 12.\nJack Hemi returned to play for Manukau after a 4-week absence due to injury. It was reported that following the Auckland v Great Britain match at Carlaw Park the week previous that the Manukau side had met to discuss what they had seen and learned from the match. Maurice Wetherill was refereeing his 50th first grade match since his debut in 1933 after retiring from playing. He became the 6th referee to achieve the feat.\nRound 13.\nThe City v Mount Albert and Ponsonby v Newton matches were both postponed due to the weather. The Ponsonby-Newton match was to be played at Stafford Park in Northcote. The number 2 field at Carlaw Park was covered in sheets of water so the reserve grade match due to be played there and the City-Mount Albert game were not able to be played. The weather was so bad that the 2 lone spectators sitting in the uncovered terraces were invited across the field to join those under cover in the railway stand.\nRound 14.\nIt was decided that the 2 postponed matches from round 13 would only be played if necessary. Going into the final round of matches the points table saw the following points for each team: Manukau 17, Richmond 16, Devonport 16, Mount Albert 15, Ponsonby 12, Marist 11, City 9, and Newton 4. Mount Albert, Ponsonby, City and Newton all had played one less game but after the final round of matches Manukau progressed to 19 competition points with their easy 26–6 win over Newton. Richmond trailed them by 1 point but had completed all of their matches while Devonport were 2 points further back so had no chance of overhauling Manukau therefore the 2 postponed matches were not necessary and thus the Fox Memorial for 1936 had been decided with Manukau winning their first ever title. The round also saw the debut of Andy Beyer for Richmond. He had previously represented Otahuhu and Auckland at rugby union.\nRoope Rooster (knockout competition).\nIt was decided to admit the Senior B champion side Papakura once again. This meant that nine teams were in the competition and Papakura drew the bye in the first round.\nRound 1.\nThe City v Newton match went to extra time as the score was locked at 15–15 at full time. Two five minute spells were played and the deadlock was broken when Craddock Dufty kicked a penalty goal from the side line. Marist fielded Andrew Fletcher of the Grammar Old Boys rugby club and Clive Murdoch of the Technical Old Boys club. Verdun Scott played for Devonport and kicked 3 goals. He later went on to become a test cricketer for New Zealand and is the only dual rugby league and cricket representative in New Zealand's history.\nSemi-finals.\nWith five teams remaining Devonport drew the bye. The Papakura v Manukau match was played at Prince Edward Park, Papakura's home ground. Steve Watene, the Manukau captain said after the match that they had \"cause to thank [their] fitness for saving defeat\" and that his team had been completely surprised by the form Papakura had shown.\nMajor semi-final.\nAs there were three teams remaining in the competition a draw was made which saw Manukau receive a bye and direct entry to the final.\nPhelan Shield.\nThe Phelan Shield was played for by the teams which had been knocked out of the Roope Rooster in the first round. They were however joined in later rounds by the likes of Papakura and Devonport who had been knocked out of the Roope Rooster competition in later rounds.\nMajor semi-final.\nMarist were awarded a bye with three teams remaining in the Phelan Shield and progressed directly to the final.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe point scoring lists are compiled from matches played in the Opening round of matches, the Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster, Phelan Shield and Stormont Shield matches which all first grade sides were eligible for competing in (provided they avoided elimination from the knock out competitions). Lou Brown after returning from playing professionally in England once again topped the try scoring lists. The top point scorer was Jack Hemi who had joined Manukau from Wairarapa where he had been playing rugby union, followed by John Anderson who had joined the Auckland competition after moving from the West Coast of the South Island. Remarkably Craddock Dufty featured on the top point scorer lists after a 5 year absence from playing, and in his 36th year in a competition dominated by players around 10 years his junior.\nSenior reserve (Norton Cup).\nReserve grade standings.\nThe Richmond match with Manukau was abandoned with Richmond leading after news arrived that Cowan (a Manukau official) had died earlier in the afternoon at Carlaw Park. Manukau had lost their round 1 match v Devonport by default. The score for the City v Newton round 10 match was not reported, neither was the round 13 match between Richmond and Newton, and the round 14 match between Manukau and Newton also had no score reported. In round 14 Richmond defeated City by default. The 12th round was washed out completely meaning only 13 rounds were played. A 15th round was scheduled on September 5, but there were no results reported indicating the round was not played.\nStallard Cup (reserve and senior B knockout).\nFollowing the conclusion of the senor reserve and senior B competitions the competitions combined for the second year in a row to compete for the Stallard Cup in a knockout competition. Papakura by winning the senior B competition had been invited to compete for the Roope Rooster, and Otahuhu and Waiuku did not field teams in the Stallard Cup. This meant that just Green Lane and Point Chevalier joined the reserve grade sides. Point Chevalier beat Manukau in round 1, and then received a bye in the second week. They were defeated by Marist in the major semi-final, with Marist progressed to the final where they played Richmond, who had had a bye into the final. Marist won by 13 points to 12 at Carlaw Park. The Green lane senior B side was defeated by City in the first round.\nSenior B competitions.\nSenior B grade standings (Sharman Cup).\nPoint Chevalier were coached by Sonny Hing once again and captained by Archie Lane. They finished third in the championship but won the knockout competition.\nSharman Cup results.\nGreen Lane had a player ruled out of order after their match with Otahuhu in round 2 but they were defeated 5–2 anyway. In round 4 Waiuku defeated Papakura 7–6; however, they fielded Roy Bright (formerly of Newton) and he had not been regraded. Waiuku were under the impressions that he was free to play for them as he had not played at all in 1935. The ARL said that it was an unfortunate technicality but they had to adhere to the rules and the match was awarded to Papakura.\nWalmsley Colts Shield.\nAfter the round 1 match between Waiuku and Green Lane the later team was asked by the ARL why they had fielded a player who was not on the team sheet. There was no score published in the newspapers but the breach of the rules indicates that Waiuku won. Green Lane also fielded an ineligible player in their round 6, 0–0 draw with Point Chevalier, so their opponents were awarded the match. Waiuku would have played Papakura in the final but they could not muster a team and defaulted the match.\nFoster Shield Knock-out.\nPoint Chevalier and Green Lane played a 'knock-out' competition match with Point Chevalier winning by 22 points to 9. Papakura had been admitted into the Roope Rooster competition and both Waiuku and Otahuhu had defaulted their recent matches leaving only two senior B teams to contest.\nOther Club Matches and Lower Grades.\nSenior club matches.\nHawke's Bay v Mount Albert.\nIn September Mount Albert travelled to Hawke's Bay to take on the local representative side and were victorious 20–16. For Mount Albert Cliff Satherley played as a guest player as he was still registered with Richmond. He moved to Mount Albert the following year. For Mount Albert Len Schultz 2, Joe Dunning 3, Peterson scored tries, and Satherley kicked a conversion.\nTaumarunui v Manukau.\nOn September 19 Manukau played the local Taumarunui side in Manunui as part of an effort to revive the sport in the area. Manukau won in the last minute 30–28. Messrs. D. Wilkie and I. Stonex represented the Auckland Rugby League on the trip. It was hoped that the sport could be established \"on a sound footing\" from Ōtorohanga to Raetihi.\nTaumarunui v Richmond.\nOn September 26 Richmond also paid a visit to Taumarunui and beat the local side 24–22 before \"a good attendance\". The Richmond 4th Grade side went down to a \"heavy\" local team in the curtain-raiser 20–16.\nLower grade competitions.\nThere were 6 lower grades in 1936 and an additional 3 schoolboy grades.\nGrades and trophy winners were as follows:\nThe Points Shields were won by Richmond (Davis Shield) in the open competition for all clubs, while the trophy for just junior clubs was won by Otahuhu (Tracy Inglis' trophy).\nJunior grade competitions.\n2nd Grade (Hayward Shield).\nThe RV club won the 2nd Grade championship (Hayward Shield). They were a company side named after Harvey and Sons Ltd. The \"RV\" being a play on the name 'Harvey'. They later joined up to form the well known company Carter Holt Harvey. Mount Albert won the knockout competition (Monteith Shield) following an 18–8 win over RV on August 29 and a 9–0 final win over Richmond on September 5. The Manukau side only had scheduled matches on May 2, and then May 30, June 6, and June 13. On July 25 RV had a bye and played the Northland representative side and lost 10–0. Post season Kamo beat the Mt Albert side 27–8.\n3rd Grade (Walker Cup).\nEllerslie won the third grade championship (Benson Cup). They were coached by former New Zealand international Charles Gregory who had coached the Marist senior side the previous two seasons. The competition was split into 2 sections with Ponsonby winning section 1, and Ellerslie section 2. The two teams met in a cross over final on September 19 with Ellerslie winning 11–10. They then met again a week later in the first week of the knockout competition with Ellerslie winning once more by 5 points to 3. City eventually won the knock out competition (Murray Cup) when they defeated Manukau 29–18 on October 31. William Pengelly of the Ponsonby side was awarded Mr. J.F.W. Dickson's medal for the most sportsmanlike player in the grade. RV beat the City club from Whangarei on September 12 in a friendly match. \n4th Grade (Hospital Cup).\nCity won the fourth grade championship (Hospital Cup) and the knock out competition (Kiwi Shield). The final round of the championship doubled as the first round of the knockout competition with City, Richmond, and Ellerslie recording wins. Then City beat Richmond 11–7, and Ellerslie beating Marist 3–0 (Marist had had a bye in the last round of the championship). Then in the final City won 11 to 9 over Ellerslie on September 19.\n5th Grade (Endean Shield).\nGlenora won the fifth grade championship (Endean Shield). Otahuhu winning the knockout competition (Milicich Cup) after beating Northcote in the final on September 12. Otahuhu had defeated Devonport in one semi final with Northcote beating Richmond 5–0 in the other. On their bye round on July 11 Richmond played Waiuku with no result reported while a week later on July 18 Waiuku beat Papakura who were on their bye round.\n6th Grade (Rhodes Shield).\nThe sixth grade championship (Rhodes Shield) was won by Richmond, with City winning the knock-out competition (Hammill Cup). The knockout competition saw Richmond beat Papakura A by default on September 12, and City beat Green Lane 28–0. In the final City won 7–6 over Richmond on September 19.\n7th Grade (Myers Cup).\nOtahuhu won the seventh grade championship (Myers Cup), the knock out competition (Oval Shield), and Walmsley Miniature Shield for a special round were both shared by Richmond and City who drew the final 3–3.\nSchoolboy competitions.\nHarold Green of Avondale donated a trophy for competition by the senior school teams. It was suggested that the trophy be named the Benson Trophy in honour of Mr. Richard Benson, a former chairman of the Auckland Rugby League. A trophy (Bennet Uniform Cup) was presented for the best team in regards to their \"playing equipment and general good conduct\". Referees would award the teams points each week and it was open to all sides in Auckland including senior teams. The final points were as follows: Northcote 28.41, Mount Albert (Intermediate) 28.09, Newton 26.81, Mount Albert (seniors) 26.33, Marist 26.25, Green Lane 26, Richmond (seniors) 25.3, Ellerslie 25.09, Richmond (Intermediate) 25.09, Ponsonby 24.5, Balmoral 23.89, Otahuhu 23.36, Manukau Rovers 23.3, Avondale 22.66, Devonport 22.\nThe following were the winning teams in each section: \nSenior (Lou Rout Challenge).\nRichmond won the championship which had a new trophy named the Rout Trophy, it was in honour of the secretary of the schoolboy committee, Lou Rout. Devonport won the knockout competition after they beat Mt Albert in the final on October 10.\nAuckland representative team.\nPrior to the selection of the selectors for the season Newton Rangers proposed that the representative selector or selectors should have no other position in the game. This was referred to the clubs for eventual decision at the annual general meeting. At the control board meeting on May 13 it was confirmed that Bert Avery would be the sole selector for the Auckland team. He had been nominated by 6 of the 8 senior clubs. Auckland had planned to celebrate the Kings Birthday weekend with a A v B trial match and a match between Auckland and Auckland Maori. However Wellington intimated that they would like to play a match with Auckland on that weekend. The ARL then dropped the A v B match and instead scheduled one between Auckland and Wellington whilst still playing the Auckland v Auckland Māori match as well. The Auckland Rugby League set the ticket prices for the Auckland v England match at 2 shillings and 6 pence. But after many complaints from the clubs that it should not be the same price as a test match the price was lowered to 2 shillings.\nThree Auckland players were to play representative football during the season however it was for neither Auckland nor New Zealand. The Northland team to play England required strengthening and so the selector E.J. Parkes chose George Kerr (Devonport), A.L. Haslam (Marist), and R Hollows (Devonport). The first two were former Northland players. At the same time the New Zealand first test team was chosen. Nine Auckland players were chosen for the first test with England. Jack Hemi, Len Scott, Wally Tittleton, Lou Brown, Tommy Trevathan, Arthur Kay, Roy Powell, Frank Pickrang, and Steve Watene. Notably the entire back division were Auckland players. For the second test Hemi was replaced by Claude Dempsey and Len Scott was replaced by Ted Mincham meaning that the backline was still composed entirely of Auckland players. Three more Auckland players strengthened the Taranaki side to play Great Britain also, they were Glover, Brimble, and one other unnamed in the papers. Glover was said to have given \"an almost flawless display, and Brimble gave a remarkable exhibition as first five-eighth\".\nAuckland (Pākēha) v Tamaki (Auckland Māori).\nThis was the first time an Auckland Māori side had played against an Auckland Pākēha side. Whilst it was named \"Auckland\" in 1936 and 1937 it was thereafter named Auckland Pākēha, or simply \"Pākēhas\" in the newspapers.\nAuckland v Wellington.\nRoss Jones (Ponsonby) debuted for Auckland along with halfback Frank Halloran (Ponsonby), and hooker Jack Satherley (Richmond). Walter Stockley (Ponsonby), Halloran's former team mate in the Northcote juniors and current team mate for Ponsonby, captained the Auckland team at five eighth.\nNorth Island v South Island (inter-island match).\nDuring the match Reginald Haslam was running with the ball when he began falling into a hole which had fallen into the ground. In the meantime he had passed the ball and play moved away but was forced to stop once the referee realised what had happened. It had formed near a drain where the water had washed away the soil beneath the ground. A ball boy was photographed standing in the hole 'buried' to his waist. The gate receipts for the match were £608 19/ with 15,000 in attendance at the match and the trial curtain-raiser.\nAuckland v England.\nThe Auckland team had been selected by Bert Avery and coached by Bert Cooke. Auckland competed well against a very strong England team before going down 22–16. Walter Cuthbert donated a trophy (a cap) for the best Auckland player which was selected by an Mr. R.F. Anderton, the touring teams co-manager as being Steve Watene. It was presented to him at the Auckland annual prize giving in November.\nAuckland Junior representatives.\nThe Auckland school representative team travelled to Whangarei to play. The match was a 3–3 draw which meant that the Auckland side retained the Golden Bloom banner.\nTāmaki (Auckland Māori) representative team.\nThe Tāmaki team were selected by Ernie Asher. Tāmaki played their first match of the season on June 15 against a Waikato Māori side at Te Kohanga. They lost 43–30 though there was no significant reporting of the match and no scorers or team lists were published. They then played a match for the Waitangi Shield against Takahiwai (Northland Māori) on July 15. The Waitangi Shield had been made by Mr. Harold Walmsley and was originally presented to Hawke's Bay. Taranaki Māori won it from them before losing it to Tāmaki who had held it in recent seasons. The City Rovers side supplied 4 players to the team. City had recruited many Māori players over previous seasons, particularly drawing them from outside Auckland. The newly formed Manukau senior side provided an amazing eight players to the side during the course of the season. This was due to the influence of Steve Watene who had moved from City Rovers to the Manukau side and been part of the recruiting process of Māori players such as Jack Hemi. One very notable inclusion in the side was Ted Brimble. Notable for the fact that he was not Māori. He was the brother of Walter Brimble and Wilfred Brimble. The three brothers had an English father and a Basutu mother, from Africa.\nWaikato Māori v Tāmaki.\nA mid week match was played between Waikato Māori and Tāmaki on June 15 at Te Kohanga however no individual scoring was reported. The only Tāmaki players named as appearing in the match were Len Kawe, Steve Watene, and Lou Brown. Jack Hemi was said to have missed the game through his injury sustained playing for Manukau.\nTāmaki v Waikato Māori.\nThis match was scheduled to be played for the Waitangi Shield at Carlaw Park on July 29 however the weather had been particularly bad during mid winter and the Carlaw Park surface was in fairly poor condition. As a result, the Auckland Rugby League cancelled the match when the weather in that weekend was bad and they wished to protect the surface from further damage prior to the first test between New Zealand and Great Britain due to be played 10 days later.\nTāmaki (Auckland Māori) representative matches played and scorers.\nThe match with Waikato Māori only saw 3 players named so the appearance statistics are incomplete and the 30 points scored by the side was not attributed to any individual players.\nRugby league annual ball.\nOn October 7 the Auckland Rugby League held their fourth annual ball at the Peter Pan Cabaret. The venue was decorated with blue, black, and white, the colours of Auckland and New Zealand. Tables were also decorated in the colours of the clubs. Arrivals were greeted by the chairman of the ladies committee, Mrs. Ivan Culpan, and Mr. A. Ferguson, chairman of the ball committee.\nAnnual General Meetings and Club News.\nAt the July 22 meeting it was discussed as to whether junior games should be postponed on the Saturday as Auckland was playing the touring Great Britain side. It was decided that the games should go ahead as they needed to progress the various competitions though an exception was made for the 2nd Grade as it was well advanced. The chairman said they were endeavouring to start the matches as early as possible in the morning. It was decided however that the junior grades would be suspended on the weekends of the first and second test as they were being played in Auckland.\nThey held their 11th annual meeting on March 23 with Mr. R.E. Newport presiding. Their report stated that there were \"11 teams in the championship and eight in the seven-a-side tournament, the season had proved most successful and a pronounced advance on the previous year\". It was hoped that a schoolboy team could be sent to the South Island to tour. The following officers were elected:- Patron, Dr. M.G. Pezaro; president, Mr. R.E. Newport; vice-presidents, last year's with the addition of Messrs. E. Bennett and R. Shaw, with power to add; hon. secretary, Mr. L. Rout; selector, Mr. S. Dickey.\nOn October 24 the schoolboys held a gala at Carlaw Park. A ten team seven-a-side tournament and running events were decided. Manukau won the seven-a-side tournament after defeating Ellerslie 3–0 in the final. A special seven-a-side match was played between Richmond A and Ngaruawahia with the Waikato side winning 9–0.\nThe attendance at their annual meeting on March 11 was said to be \"easily the best for a number of years\". Mr. J. Clark occupied the chair. The club was said to be in a \"highly satisfactory\" financial position. There was a lengthy discussion on the allocation of the local playing area given the recent controversy over the allocation of Sturges Park exclusively to the rugby union. They decided to nominate teams in the senior B, third intermediate, fourth grade, fifth grade and schoolboys' competitions. The following were elected officers:- Patron, Mr. W.W. Massey; president, Mr. J. Nicholson; vice-presidents, same as last year, with the addition of Messrs, W. Speedy and W. Baxter, with power to add; chairman, Mr. Jim Clark; secretary, Mr. W. Hart; treasurer, Mr. W. Bright; committee, Messrs, W. McManus, J. Graham, W. Gordon, M. Clark, Trevena, W. Whitelaw, M. Ritchie, W. Lockhart, and C. Finlayson. At the control board meeting on April 1, Otahuhu advised that it had arranged an ideal ground in Princess Street, Otahuhu and its request for goal posts was granted. Otahuhu claimed transfer fees for several players at the May 19 junior management meeting. They included R. Halsey and M. Hucker (to Mount Albert), R. Philp and G Whye (to Manukau), and K. Finlayson (to Marist). These transfer fee requests were all referred to the senior board.\nThe cost for installing floodlights at Prince Edward Park for the Papakura club to train under was estimated at £28 by the council. They intended to inform the club to see if they were prepared to pay a portion a rent for the ground to assist with the cost. On April 14 the Papakura town board at their meeting stated that the league club had suggested that two floodlights be erected at Prince Edward park. The cost of each would be £14, including £2 for installation. Mr. H.D. Spinley suggested that \"the club pay for one light each. The club had plenty of money, its funds being obtained from Auckland\". It was decided to advise the club and ask for their comments. They also planned to ask the Auckland Electric Power Board for the cost of erecting a special floodlight in Queen Street in Papakura to light the playing area in the park, and also whether a slot-meter could be installed. On April 27 at the Papakura Town Board meeting it was virtually decided to install a floodlight where Cooke Street and Queen Street meet which would light up the new portion of the park for practices with a meter being installed. On April 23 the Papakura club held a dance in the Regent Theatre which in spite of bad weather was a \"success\". After the supper adjournment Mr. Ben Davidson, ex-New Zealand player presented the Foster Memorial Shield to the captain (Mr. E. Pope) of the Papakura senior B team which the team had won 4 out of 5 times. They were also presented with the Walmsley Shield. Papakura secured Ben Davidson as their coach. He intended to travel from Auckland out to Papakura each Wednesday evening and to do so voluntarily. On June 10 Papakura held a club dance at the Regent Theatre that \"attracted one of the largest crowds seen at a local dance for some time\". Music was supplied by Shalfoon's orchestra. The Papakura Town Board decided that the rugby league club should pay a sum of not less than £5 annually for the use of Prince Edward Park. The club held their carnival dance at the Regent Theatre on August 28 with it crowded to almost capacity with about 300 present. Music was supplied by Epi Shalfoon's orchestra For the Roope Rooster match with Manukau on September 12 the Papakura side fielded three Burgess brothers, two Francis brothers, and two Taylor brothers. The Papakura club held their annual 'smoke' concert in the Regent theatre in Papakura. The building was \"packed\" and featured music from the S.S. Remuera orchestra led by Mr. Alan Dunker. Numerous people spoke about the administration of the game, the state of the club, and various other matters. On November 28 the Papakura club held their annual picnic at Mr. N.J. Sutherland's farm in south Clevedon. There were nearly 500 people in attendance who had been transported to the venue in \"fleets of motor lorries\". Various races were held for different age groups and at the conclusion the president of the club, Mr. H. Pollock presented prizes, and Mr. Les McVeagh awarded a silver cup to R. Burgess for winning the cub championship 100 yard race.\nBert Cooke was appointed the coach and selector of the Ponsonby United club for the 1936 season after he had retired from playing with Richmond Rovers the previous year. Prior to Ponsonby's round 7 match they secured the services of Ernest Alfred Neale, who had represented Wellington and Auckland at rugby union. On September 5 the Ponsonby 3rd grade team travelled to Whangarei to play the Northland Junior side (Under 11 stone). Northland Juniors won 5 points to 0.

The Vikings represent Cleveland State University in the NCAA's Horizon League.\nCleveland State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1929. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Cleveland State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Goldfield won the league championship in the only season of minor league play in Goldfield, Nevada.\nHistory.\nPrior to the Nevada State League, the Goldfield Athletic Club hosted local baseball teams, beginning in 1905.\nIn 1907, Goldfield was the largest city in Nevada, with over 20,000 residents. Goldfield became a charter member of the 1907 Nevada State League, which began minor league play as a four–team Independent league. John T. Powers, who later served as president of the Federal League, was the Nevada State League president. The 1907 Nevada State League charter franchises were based in Carson City, Nevada, Goldfield, Nevada, Reno, Nevada and Tonopah, Nevada.\nOn June 27, 1907 the Goldfield League Baseball Association was legally formed in Goldfield, likely the foundation for ownership of the minor league team.\nWith John T. Powers serving as league president and Bert Ulmer as treasurer a Nevada State League meeting July 6, 1907 was held at the office of Senator Boyd. At the meeting, the board of directors were elected. Ben Rosenthal of Goldfield, Senator James T. Boyd of Reno, J.P Merder of Carson City and Thomas Kendall of Tonopah became the directors. Powers had previously served as president of the Wisconsin State League. Ulmer was an owner of the Elite Saloon in Goldfield. James T. Boyd was a member of the Nevada State Senate from 1906 to 1910. Rosenthal was Goldfield County commissioner. Kendall was a mining pioneer, owner of the Kendall Mine and a founder of Tonopah.\nAs Goldfield played in their first season, they hosted a home game on August 7, 1907. League president John T. Powers was scheduled to umpire the Goldfield game on that day. Powers took the field with loaded revolvers strapped around his waist. With word that there was $5,000 in bets on the game, Powers armed himself. Powers was disarmed by the local sheriff before the game and the game was allowed to begin.\nResearch indicates the Goldfield franchise used the \"Miners\" moniker and won the Nevada State League championship in a shortened 1907 season. The other league members were noted to have been called the Carson City \"Capitals\", Reno \"Mudhens\" and Tonopah \"Mollycoddlers\". Unofficial records place Goldfield in first place with a 9–5 record. Goldfield was a head of second place Carson City, with a 7–4–1 record. They were followed by the Tonopah \"Mollycoddlers\" at 3–6 and the Reno \"Mudhens\"with a 3–7–1 record. It is noted that the Reno team disbanded on July 15, 1907, and it is possible the rest of the league, Goldfield included, followed suit, as only three teams would have remained. Goldfield has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe exact name and location of the 1907 Goldfield ballpark is unknown. The Goldfield Athletic Club field was in use during the era. The park location was possibly in or near the area that was refurbished with help from promoter and Goldfield Saloon owner Tex Rickard to host an infamous 42-round boxing match on Labor Day 1906 featuring Joe Gans against Oscar Nelson. Gans won the bout. Today, there is a marker in Goldfield signifying the site of the fight, which had 15,000 in attendance.\nNotable alumni.\nThe Goldfield 1907 roster information is unknown."

        "title": "RealSports Baseball",
        "text": "RealSports Baseball (also known as Super Baseball and simply as Baseball) is a 1982 sports video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. originally for the Atari 2600. It was also launched on the Atari 5200 and 7800 machines. A version for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers was also in development, but it was cancelled.\nThe game was developed in response to an aggressive marketing campaign by Mattel and released as part of the \"RealSports\" game series. The Atari 5200 version of the game was positively reviewed both contemporarily and retrospectively. The game has been re-released by Atari SA who inherited the intellectual property in the game.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was part of a series of games released under the \"RealSports\" title for the Atari 2600, including \"RealSports Football\", \"RealSports Volleyball\", and \"RealSports Soccer\". The series was conceived as an answer to Mattel Electronics's aggressive marketing campaign fronted by George Plimpton, in which they compared the graphically and gameplay-wise dated Atari 2600 sports games, including Atari's 1978 baseball game \"Home Run\", to their more advanced Intellivision counterparts.\nThe originally-released \"RealSports Baseball\" included a number of software bugs that impaired the quality of play. As a result, an improved version for the 2600 platform entitled \"Super Baseball\" was subsequently released in March 1989, fixing some, but not all, of the errors. \"Super Baseball\" also included some graphical improvements. A version with \"Voice Controller\" support, an unreleased voice command device for the 2600, was announced at the 1983 Summer Consumer Electronics Show with a 1983 release date. In this version the pitching, the batting, and the fielding utilized the regular joystick, the voice commands could be only used to throw the ball to the bases.\nWith the launch of the Atari 5200 and Atari 7800 platforms new versions of the game were also developed for them. Jim Andreasen started to work on the 5200 version of \"RealSports Baseball\" right after he finished \"RealSports Football\", but he later shelved the project citing burn out. After that Keithen Hayenga was assigned to finish the game, but because he wasn't satisfied with the graphics, he chose to start over the project from scratch. He was allowed to use an additional 8 kilobyte of ROM space to put in voice, he used half of it for additional game logic. Andreasen later helped to finish off the gameplay. The game was written in machine code. A version for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers was also in development, but it was never released, however in the years since prototype copies of the game have become available. Atari halted the development of this version in hope that the game would sell more 5200 systems. The game was heavily used in advertisements of the system. The 5200 version is the first video game with voice, that doesn't require a separate add-on for the voice synthesis.\nDespite the significantly improved graphics hardware of the Atari 7800, the 7800 version of the game features downgraded graphics and sounds compared to the 5200 version. It also has more limited gameplay and it's generally buggier.\nThe cover art for the original 2600 release was done by Michel Allaire, whilst that for the 5200 release was drawn by D. Smith. Warren Chang created the interior artwork used in the manuals of both the 2600 and 5200 editions. The game's 1982 television advertising campaign was fronted by Oakland Athletics manager Billy Martin.\nGameplay.\nIn this game Atari improved on \"Home Run\", their previous baseball-themed game for the 2600 platform, by including a baseball diamond, fly-balls, throwing of the ball by fielders to tag the opposing player out, and other traditional features of the sport of baseball. Players are able to use the joystick to select the kind of swing the batter will make, with bunts, grounders, and fly-balls all possible. The 2600 and 5200 versions of the game features four variations of play, with the player able to select between single-play and two-player and between the batter being able to strike any ball or only being able to hit balls from within the strike zone. The Atari 5200 version featured the voice of an electronic announcer calling the plays.\nReception.\nA review of the original \"RealSports Baseball\" in the August 1983 issue of \"Electronic Games\" magazine praised the game, comparing it positively to \"Home Run\", saying that \"Thanks to \"RealSports Baseball\", Atari 2600 owners finally have a game they can love\". A review of the 2600 version in the August-September 1983 issue of \"Vidiot\" magazine was critical of the game, describing the game as \"lots better than 'Home Run', but not much more real\". The 1984 \"Book of Atari Software\" described \"RealSports Baseball\" for the 2600 platform as \"not the best baseball game\" but \"very playable\" and \"not a disappointing cartridge at all\", and gave the game an overall score of \"B\". A review in the January 1984 edition of \"Video and Computer Gaming Illustrated\" described the game as a game that \"gives you the opportunity to play strategically\". In March 1984 the staff and writers of \"Video and Computer Gaming Illustrated\" also awarded the game their Vista prize in the category Best 2600 Sports, an accolade it shared jointly with \"Super Challenge Baseball\".\nThe 5200 version was positively reviewed by Bill Kunkel in \"Electronic Games\" magazine in a May 1984 review, describing the game as \"definitely a hit\". A July 1984 review of baseball games in the same publication praised especially the improved controls and sound-effects of \"RealSports Baseball\" for the 5200. The 5200 version also won the \"Computer Entertainer\" (also known as \"Video Game Update\") 1983 award in the Best Sports Game category jointly with \"Star League Baseball\". The 2600 version received a Certificate of Merit in the Best Sports Videogame category at the 1984 Arkie Awards, while the 5200 version received one at the 1985 Arkie Awards.\nReviewing the enhanced 2600 version titled \"Super Baseball\", in the May/June 1989 issue of \"Atarian\" magazine, John Jainschigg gave the game a positive review, describing it as an \"amazing simulation\".\nIn the 2007 book \"Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide\", Brett Weiss reviewed the original \"RealSports Baseball\" negatively, criticising the bugs. Weiss reviewed the subsequently-released \"Super Baseball\" version more positively as some of the bugs had been fixed. The Atari 5200 version of \"RealSports Baseball\" was positively received by Weiss, who said it \"rival[ed] \"Pete Rose Baseball\" as the best baseball game ever made for any Atari system\". Kieren Hawken reviewing the game in \"The A–Z of Atari 8-bit Games: Volume 4\" in 2021 praised the \"colourful and well animated\" graphics and the \"very good\" sound effects and sound, giving the game 7/10 overall.\nThe 5200 version was one of the most popular game for the system, and it got a reprint after Atari ceased development of new 5200 games.\nLegacy.\nThe intellectual property rights for the game passed to Hasbro Interactive and were subsequently bought by Infogrames in 2001, which was subsequently re-named Atari SA. The 2600 version of the game was re-released by Infogrames on the 2005 \"Atari Anthology\". It was then subsequently re-released for the Atari Flashback 3 in 2011, which was the first console of the \"Flashback\" series made by the AtGames company. As of 2021, the game has been included on all subsequent \"Flashback\" consoles, including the \"Flashback 4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", and \"X\"."

He played college basketball player for the James Madison Dukes.\nCollege career.\nLewis starred at Bishop O'Connell High School in Arlington, Virginia and chose James Madison University (JMU) for college. He entered the starting lineup for the Dukes, averaging 14.5 points and 3.5 rebounds per game in his freshman season, earning Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) All-Rookie Team honors. Lewis followed this up with a sophomore year where he averaged 16.4 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.2 assists, garnering third-team All-CAA honors. In his junior year, Lewis again improved his scoring average to 19 points per game and earned second-team All-CAA honors, though the Dukes experienced little on-court success, finishing in last place. After head coach Louis Rowe was fired, Lewis chose to declare for the 2020 NBA draft, though he retained his college eligibility by not hiring an agent.\nUltimately Lewis decided to return to JMU for his senior season under new coach Mark Byington, who helped advise Lewis and his family through the testing process. In advance of his senior season, Lewis was chosen as the preseason CAA Player of the Year, although the Dukes were predicted to finish ninth in the 10-team league. While the Dukes' 2020–21 season were paused several times due to COVID-19 protocols, both Lewis and the Dukes team experienced success. Lewis was named the national player of the week by the United States Basketball Writers Association on January 17, 2021 after hitting a school record nine three-pointers in a 30 point effort against Towson. Lewis' 2020–21 season ended prematurely when he suffered a knee injury on February 14, 2021 and was later ruled out for the remainder of the year.

        "title": "Bury Golf Club",
        "text": "Bury Golf Club, is a private golf course and club in Unsworth, Bury, designed by Alister MacKenzie, Charles Hugh Alison, and Harry Shapland Colt. The club was originally located at a course in Redvales, Bury, before moving to its current Unsworth location in 1922. The current course is eighteen-holes in length, and sits east of the clubhouse at Unsworth Hall. Notable players include Harry Vardon, Henry James, Sandy Herd, and Alister MacKenzie.\nHistory.\nRedvales (1890-1918).\nBury Golf Club is one of the oldest in its district. The club was instituted in 1890, just before the late 19th century's golf boom, and was attached to a nine-hole course in Redvales, Bury \"(sometimes referred to as Redvales Links)\". Harry Vardon was the professional at the Redvales site for three years, and was the club's first professional, before leaving in 1896 for Ganton Golf Club. According to \"Spalding's Official Golf Guide\", it was at Bury that he adopted the \"Vardon Grip\", a popular grip used by many today. Sandy Herd also played on the Redvales course during this time.\nOn the character of the course, then captain, S. F. Butcher in 1892 writes:\nHarry Vardon, both club professional and greenskeeper at the time, wrote the following in 1893:\nIn 1904, the club first presented a plan to extend the Redvales course by a further nine holes to create an eighteen-hole course, in 1907 funding was secured, and the work began. The new eighteen-hole course was formally opened on 19 September 1908.\nDuring its time at Redvales, the club hosted regular monthly medal competitions in both seasons, an annual Boxing Day tournament, ladies' day competitions, the Kay Gold Medal, the St. Anne Cup, and the Schofield Gold Challenge Medal (awarded by A. B. Schofield). Also, there was the Sir Henry James Challenge Cup (also referred to as the James Challenge Cup), which was awarded by Henry James, 1st Baron James of Hereford, who was the club's president during the 1890s.\nDuring the First World War, the Redvales course was commandeered to support agricultural food production. The club gave the course up for ploughing in January 1918, and so the club closed down for the remainder of war. The club remained out of operation until after the war had ended, when it then began searching for a new home.\nUnsworth (1920-present).\nIn 1920, the club acquired the building and land surrounding Unsworth Lodge with money collected from donations, renaming Unsworth Lodge to Unsworth Hall. The hall, an early 19th century Georgian mansion, was formerly occupied by the first mayor of Bury, Alderman John Duckworth. Since its purchase by the club, the building has been refurbished, and then extended some time around the 1950s, and is currently on Bury Council's list of buildings of special architectural or historic interest as a non-designated heritage asset, due to its landmark status and ties to the first mayor.\nThe club commissioned golf course architects Colt, Mackenzie and Alison to design a new 18-hole course for the new location. The Unsworth site was chosen due to its proximity to both Bury and Manchester, and its moorland terrain. The construction took place through the course of 1920-1922, with the first of the nine links opening in 1921, and the rest fully operational by 1922. The club continues to operate from the Unsworth course to date.\nBefore its centenary in 1990, the Earl of Derby became the club's patron, providing the club with a trophy.\nFacilities.\nCourse.\nThe 18-hole semi-moorland course is around 6,000 yards, and contains some classic holes including three designed with McKenzie two-tier greens. The course contains diversified natural features and undulating contours; no two holes are alike, nor are there many which lie in the same direction, providing a varied and fair testing round.

Two days later, New Zealand faced Italy knowing that a defeat would mean that they would be eliminated from the World Cup at the pool stage for the first time ever.

The next day, Scotland defeated Tonga in a bonus-point victory with a scoreline of 45–17 with seven tries to keep their hopes of progression to the knockout stage alive, while putting Tonga on the brink of elimination. \nGoing into the penultimate weekend of pool stage fixtures, four teams in the group still held their fate in their own hands. Leaders Ireland faced a bye week, while both Tonga and Scotland faced possible elimination if they lost their match. On 30 September, Scotland hammered Romania with a 84–0 scoreline, a result which officially eliminated Romania from the tournament. Twelve tries were scored by the Scots, including Darcy Graham who provided four of them and Ben Healy converting eleven of them.

Ben Donaldson earned himself two tries while also succeeding in 3 conversions and 3 penalties, earning him player of the match. The following day, Wales faced Fiji in a pulsating encounter which Wales edged in a scoreline of 32–26.

In a physical match which saw three players sin-binned, the Australians came out victorious with a 34–14 scoreline, despite a valiant Portuguese effort. Five tries were scored by Australia, two not converted, to secure a bonus-point win and keep their faint hopes of progression to the knockout stage alive while officially knocking Portugal out of the tournament. \nAhead of the final matchweek in the pool, which Australia would not play, Fiji needed just a point from their match against Portugal to advance to the knockout stage alongside Wales and ahead of Australia. On 7 October, Wales played their final match of the pool against Georgia in which they came out with a 43–19 victory, courtesy of a hat-trick from Louis Rees-Zammit, to officially secure the Welsh top spot in Pool C. All that was left in Pool C was the final match the following day between Fiji and Portugal, to officially decide whether it would be Australia or Fiji who would finish second in the pool and join Wales in the knockout stage. With the exception of a few moments, Fiji started the game slowly and by halftime the scoreline was level at 3–3, with both teams having scored only a penalty each. By the 51st minute, Portugal looked to pull off a historic upset with Francisco Fernandes scoring a try, which converted, brought the scoreline to 10–17. In the 68th minute, a well-worked drive from Mesake Doge levelled the score at 17–17. Two converted penalties for Fiji within the space of four minutes looked to seal their place in the last-eight for them, however, in the final minute of the game, Rodrigo Marta ran in a last try. Samuel Marques would convert, bringing the final scoreline to 23–24, and marking Portugal's first ever victory in a World Cup tournament. Although Fiji lost the match, they were awarded a losing bonus-point as they lost the game within a margin of seven points, therefore putting them level with Australia on points in the standings. According to the tiebreaking criteria, advancement therefore went to the team with the better head-to-head record. Because Fiji had won against Australia, they went through to the knockout stage, and for the first time in their history, Australia was eliminated in the pool stages. Portugal finished in fourth, while Georgia took fifth.\nStandings.\n&lt;section begin=standings /&gt;&lt;section end=standings /&gt;\nMatches.\nAustralia vs Georgia.\n&lt;section begin=\"AusVsGeo\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"AusVsGeo\" /&gt;\nWales vs Fiji.\n&lt;section begin=\"WalVsFij\" /&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"WalVsFij\" /&gt;\nWales vs Portugal.\n&lt;section begin=\"WalVsPor\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"WalVsPor\" /&gt;\nAustralia vs Fiji.\n&lt;section begin=\"AusVsFij\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"AusVsFij\" /&gt;\nGeorgia vs Portugal.\n&lt;section begin=\"GeoVsPor\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"GeoVsPor\" /&gt;\nWales vs Australia.\n&lt;section begin=\"WalVsAus\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"WalVsAus\" /&gt;\nFiji vs Georgia.\n&lt;section begin=\"FijVsGeo\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"FijVsGeo\" /&gt;\nAustralia vs Portugal.\n&lt;section begin=\"AusVsPor\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"AusVsPor\" /&gt;\nWales vs Georgia.\n&lt;section begin=\"WalVsGeo\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"WalVsGeo\" /&gt;\nFiji vs Portugal.\n&lt;section begin=\"FijVsPor\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"FijVsPor\" /&gt;"

        "text": "Pool D of the 2023 Rugby World Cup began on 9 September 2023 and concluded on 8 October 2023. The pool included 2003 champions and 2019 runner-ups England, previous hosts Japan, and Argentina. They are joined by Samoa, the winner of the Oceania 1 qualifier, and tournament debutants Chile (Americas 2). England topped the group and Argentina placed second, thus allowing both teams to progress.\nTeams.\nNotes\nOverview.\nIn the opening match of Pool D, England defeated Argentina by 27–10. Despite losing Tom Curry to a red card for a dangerous head-to-head with Juan Cruz Mallía, England went over the line courtesy of a player-of-the-match performance from George Ford who scored three drop goals and six penalties, with Argentina's Rodrigo Bruni scoring the only try of the match. Japan faced debutants Chile the following day, in which Japan came out winners in a score of 42–12 despite the best efforts of Chile in their first World Cup appearance. After a six day rest, Samoa played their first match of the pool against Chile in which they came out with a 43–10 bonus-point victory in Bordeaux. The next day, England secured a bonus point victory over Japan in a 34–12 win.\nOn 22 September, Argentina defeated Samoa with a scoreline of 19–10, with Emiliano Boffelli securing a converted try and 3 penalties, earning him player of the match. The result left the group finely poised and lifted hopes of progression to the knockout stage for Argentina. The next day, England moved on to the brink of qualifying for the knockout stage, after defeating Chile with a scoreline of 71–0 with Henry Arundell earning player of the match having scored five tries in the match. Chile were officially eliminated from the tournament following the result. As Pool D began to near its conclusion, Japan faced Samoa on 28 September in a match of high stakes for both sides. Tries from Lappies Labuschagné, Michael Leitch and Kazuki Himeno secured Japan a 28–22 victory over the Samoans to boost their hopes of progression to the knockout stage, while officially securing England's place who were thus confirmed to top the pool. Samoa, who lost Ben Lam to a red card for an upright tackle, were left requiring a victory in their final match against England to have a chance at progression. Two days later, on 30 September, Chile played their last match of their first ever Rugby World Cup against Argentina in Nantes in what was the first ever meeting between two South American sides in a World Cup. The Argentinians raced to a 59–5 victory over the Chileans, scoring eight tries along with strong kicking from Nicolás Sánchez and Santiago Carreras to set up a showdown with Japan on the final matchday to decide who would join England in the quarter-finals.\nOn 7 October, England played their final match of the pool against Samoa in Villeneuve-d'Ascq. Despite a valiant effort from the Samoans, who scored two tries through Nigel Ah Wong, England edged the match in an 18–17 victory from a Danny Care try in the 73rd minute to give the English a full house of wins from Pool D as they headed into the quarter-finals while eliminating any hope of Samoa progressing themselves, which place Argentina and Japan in the 2027 Rugby World Cup before the match between two nations. All that remained in the pool was the final match the following day between Japan and Argentina to decide who would finish second and join England in the knockout stage. The high stakes match took place in Nantes, where Mateo Carreras scored a hat-trick as Argentina came out 39–27 victors in a 66-point thriller to finish second in the pool and send themselves through to the quarter-finals with England who topped Pool D and left Japan eliminated from the tournament as they finished in third place.\nStandings.\n&lt;section begin=standings /&gt;&lt;section end=standings /&gt;\nMatches.\nEngland vs Argentina.\n&lt;section begin=\"EngVsArg\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"EngVsArg\" /&gt;\nJapan vs Chile.\n&lt;section begin=\"JpnVsChi\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"JpnVsChi\" /&gt;\nSamoa vs Chile.\n&lt;section begin=\"SamVsChi\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"SamVsChi\" /&gt;\nEngland vs Japan.\n&lt;section begin=\"EngVsJpn\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"EngVsJpn\" /&gt;\nArgentina vs Samoa.\n&lt;section begin=\"ArgVsSam\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"ArgVsSam\" /&gt;\nEngland vs Chile.\n&lt;section begin=\"EngVsChi\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"EngVsChi\" /&gt;\nJapan vs Samoa.\n&lt;section begin=\"JpnVsSam\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"JpnVsSam\" /&gt;\nArgentina vs Chile.\n&lt;section begin=\"ArgVsChi\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"ArgVsChi\" /&gt;\nEngland vs Samoa.\n&lt;section begin=\"EngVsSam\" /&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;section end=\"EngVsSam\" /&gt;\nJapan vs Argentina.\n&lt;section begin=\"JpnVsArg\" /&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"JpnVsArg\" /&gt;"

        "title": "Matt Weiss (American football)",
        "text": " \nMatthew Weiss (born March 1, 1983) is an American football coach who most recently was the quarterbacks coach and co-offensive coordinator for the Michigan Wolverines. A native of Connecticut, he played college football for Vanderbilt and then served as a coach in multiple capacities for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL).\nEarly years.\nMatt Weiss was born in Cheshire, Connecticut on March 1, 1983. He attended Hopkins School in Connecticut, where he graduated in 2001. He played baseball and football for his high school, where as the quarterback, he led his team to a 12-0 record, the first time this had been achieved at this school, as well as winning the school’s first New England Prep School Class C championship in 2001. Weiss then attended Vanderbilt University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics and human and organizational development. While working as a graduate assistant at Stanford he earned a master's degree in liberal arts in 2008.\nCollegiate playing career.\nA double major in English and economics, Weiss was a walk-on third string punter for the Vanderbilt Commodores from 2001 to 2003. However, Weiss never played in a game at Vanderbilt and was not included on the Sports Reference final roster in the years he attended the university.\nCoaching career.\nSmyrna High School (2003–2004).\nWeiss was an assistant coach at Smyrna High School in 2003 and 2004, helping to introduce a tutoring program that supported student-athletes in gaining NCAA eligibility.\nStanford University (2005–2008).\nWeiss was a graduate assistant at Stanford University from 2005 to 2008. He also was the defensive and special teams assistant in his final year at Stanford.\nBaltimore Ravens (2009–2020).\nWeiss was given an assistant coaching role for the Baltimore Ravens in 2009 under head coach, John Harbaugh. He was then given the defensive quality coach role in 2012, a role in which he held until 2014 when Weiss became the line-backers coach. He also featured in the Raven's Super Bowl-winning team in Super Bowl XLVII, in which they defeated the San Francisco 49ers 34-31. Weiss was appointed the cornerback coach in 2015, then, in 2016 he became the assistant quarterback coach, and in 2018, Weiss became the assistant wide receiver and free safety coach. His final role with the Ravens was in 2019 when he was given the running back coach role, after the conclusion of the 2020/21 NFL season Weiss left the Ravens to become the Michigan quarterback’s coach.\nAssistant to head coach.\nWeiss was hired by the Baltimore Ravens in 2009 as an assistant to head coach John Harbaugh. Weiss was part of the Ravens' coaching staff that won Super Bowl XLVII. In 2014, with Weiss as assistant linebackers coach, linebackers Terrell Suggs and Elvis Dumervil combined to be the NFL's top sack tandem with 29 sacks combined. Inside Linebacker C. J. Mosley also became the first rookie in franchise history to be selected to the Pro Bowl. In 2015, with Weiss as cornerbacks coach, the Ravens' pass defense improved from 23rd the prior year (337.4 YPG) to 10th overall (233.6 YPG). \nLinebacker coach.\nWeiss was the assistant in charge of linebackers in 2014. In that season, Raven linebackers, Elvis Dumervil and Terrell Suggs had the most sacks as a duo in the NFL, with 29. Dumervil also broke the franchise record for sacks in this season with 17 as well as reached the pro bowl in the same season. Inside linebacker C. J. Mosley also became the first rookie in franchise history to be selected to the Pro Bowl.\nNFL rushing record in 2019.\nWeiss was the running backs coach for the Baltimore Ravens in 2019, in this season the Baltimore Ravens broke the NFL’s single-season rushing yards total with 3,296, beating the previous record by the New England Patriots in 1978 of 3,165 yards. As well as two Ravens players featuring in the top five for yards per attempt, those being quarterback Lamar Jackson and running-back, Mark Ingram II. During that same season, running back Mark Ingram II averaged a career high 5.0 yards per carry, was selected to the Pro Bowl, and tied a franchise record with 15 touchdowns. Weiss aimed to minimise fumbles in order to maximise yards, with Lamar Jackson also breaking the record for most rushing yards by a quarterback in a single season as well as reducing his fumbles from ten to eight. This being important as a fumble provides the other team with the ball. With Lamar Jackson and Mark Ingram II becoming only the seventh pair of teammates to rush over 1000 yards in a season playing only 15 games out of the 16 possible. In 2020, running back J. K. Dobbins led all NFL running backs in yards per carry. Lamar Jackson was also the unanimous 2019 NFL MVP in that season. \nBaltimore Ravens' 2020 COVID-19 outbreak.\nIn Week 12 of 2020, the Baltimore Ravens had a COVID outbreak within the team. With Ravens personnel testing positive for 10 days straight, Weiss did not travel with the team for their game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Over 16 Ravens players were placed on the COVID list, which at the time was a 10-day quarantine period, with star players such as quarterback Lamar Jackson featuring on this list. Weiss ultimately did not feature on the coaching staff for the Ravens in the Week 12 matchup against the Steelers due to illness. \nUniversity of Michigan (2021–2023).\nWeiss left the Ravens following the 2020 season to join the Michigan Wolverines as their quarterbacks coach. Weiss reunited with former Stanford coach and John Harbaugh’s brother, Jim Harbaugh. According to author Pete DiPrimio, Weiss was joining a side that showed “offensive flaws” in 2019. In his first season with the team, the 2021 Wolverines won their first Big Ten championship since 2003. The Wolverines ultimately finished 12–2 after losing in the College Football Playoff semifinal Orange Bowl to the eventual champions, the Georgia Bulldogs. In his second season, the 2022 Wolverines won their first 13 games and repeated as Big Ten champions before losing in the College Football Playoff semifinal Fiesta Bowl to TCU.\nIn January 2023, Weiss was placed on leave during an investigation of computer access crimes by university police. On January 20, 2023, Weiss was fired.\nRelationship with the Harbaugh brothers.\nWeiss has worked under both Jim and John Harbaugh during his coaching career. First working with the head coach, Jim Harbaugh at Stanford University as a graduate assistant and later the defensive and special teams assistant. Weiss then moved to the Baltimore Ravens in 2009 and worked under head coach, John Harbaugh throughout his whole tenure with the Ravens from 2009 to 2020. Weiss returned to working with the head coach, Jim Harbaugh at the Michigan Wolverines in 2020 as the quarterbacks coach and co-offensive coordinator. With Jim stating the reasoning behind his hiring of Weiss being, “That was the opportunity to hire Matt Weiss. That was one of the reasons I looked into and thought it was the best thing for our team.”\nPersonal life.\nWeiss and his wife, Melissa, have a son, and two daughters."

The proposed building of a services in the Rugby area dates back to 1975, when plans were put forward for a site at Harborough Magna, approximately two miles north of Junction 1; the slip roads for the site were built and exist to this day, but the plan was shelved in 1980. \nA further proposal was made in 2003 by Extra MSA Services, but was rejected by Warwickshire County Council as it would violate their green belt planning policy. A new plan by Moto was put forward in 2016 and approved in November 2017.\nThe services were due to open in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic and adverse weather conditions meant that opening was delayed until 30 April 2021. In October 2022, the services was named the best in Britain by a survey of over 31,000 people by Transport Focus, the statutory watchdog for transport passengers and road users."

For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually from the spare round holders or from bullets deposited by the athlete into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still standing targets, one penalty loop must be taken for each remaining target. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five).\nStandings.\n4 of 6 competitions scored "

        "text": "The 2016–17 Arizona State Sun Devils men's ice hockey season was the 2nd season of play for the program at the Division I level. The Sun Devils represented Arizona State University and were coached by Greg Powers, in his 8th season.\nSeason.\nFor the program's second varsity season, the team began by running a gauntlet of ranked teams. As a result, Arizona State's record was very poor to start the season. After a small reprieve in the middle of the year the team ran through another slate of ranked programs to end the season, however, the early-season difficulties appeared to have helped because the Sun Devils were able to win one and tie two matches against such opponents. Because of the team's recent entry into Division I, Arizona State had a difficult time scheduling games at the end of the year and were forced to play a series against a Division II program (Southern New Hampshire) and end the season with two weekends against non-NCAA teams.\nGreg Powers did bring in the program's first big recruit in Joey Daccord and, though he did not help much in his freshman season, he would provide a massive boon to the Sun Devils in the near future.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\nPlayers drafted into the NHL.\n2017 NHL Entry Draft.\nNo Arizona State players were selected in the NHL draft."

        "text": "Joseph Henry \"Joe\" Tanner (November 16, 1931 – April 1, 2020) was an American professional baseball player, coach, and farm system instructor spanning over 50 years.\nAfter a standout season hitting at Jones Junior College, Tanner played one year for the Texas Longhorns baseball team, making it to the 1952 College World Series. Tanner signed with the Boston Red Sox in 1953, playing just 25 games for the Red Sox Triple-A Louisville Colonels, before he spent the next two years in the US Army as an infantryman, returning to baseball for spring training in 1955. From 1955 to 1958, Tanner played for the Red Sox Double A and Triple-A affiliates. In 1959, Tanner signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers’ organization where he played his final three professional seasons at Triple-A before a back injury ended his professional career in 1961.\nTanner spent the next seven years playing semi-pro baseball, culminating in being named the National Baseball Congress World Series MVP in 1968, while playing for the semi-pro Jackson Braves.\nIn 1969, Tanner entered coaching, as a bunting and baserunning coach for the brand new Kansas City Royals Baseball Academy, which produced major leaguers Ron Washington, U L Washington, and Frank White. After four years at the Royals Academy, Tanner was the Chicago White Sox roving baserunning coach for two seasons. After the second season, Tanner took an 11-year break from professional baseball, utilizing his Business and Finance degree from the University of Texas at Austin to be a stockbroker in Texas.\nIn 1986, new Pittsburgh Pirates General Manager Syd Thrift, who had hired Tanner with the Royals in 1969, hired Tanner to be a Pirates roving instructor, focusing on bunting and baserunning. After two seasons with Pittsburgh, Tanner returned to the White Sox as a baserunning and bunting instructor, where he would invent a baseball practice tool that can now be found at every MLB Spring Training facility, the Tanner Tee, a metal batting tee with a soft rubber top. The Tanner Tee is not only used by every major league baseball team but many college and high school teams as well.\nTanner would spend much of the next two decades starting a business, Joe H. Tanner Baseball Products, LLC, in Sarasota, Florida, based around his innovative and increasingly popular tee. In 1993, Tanner was the Chicago Cubs roving infield and baserunning instructor. In 1994, Tanner got his first job on a coaching staff outside of the spring training facility, as the hitting coach of the Cubs’ Single-A Peoria Chiefs. Tanner moved to the Baltimore Orioles organization in 1996 and was an assistant coach for the Rookie League Gulf Coast Orioles from 1999 to 2003.\nIn 2012, Tanner sold the company to his grandsons but continued to make tees at his workbench. Joe Tanner died on April 1, 2020, in Sarasota, Florida."

The NCCA has a long history dating back to the early 1970s, with Farndon becoming champions of Division 1 in 1973.\nThe Newark Club Cricket Alliance operates mainly in the south and east of Nottinghamshire, but clubs are known to participate from beyond the county boundary, with representatives from Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire. In 2014 the League Management Committee recommended a 30-mile radius from Newark for new clubs joining the league. The NCCA has around 40 clubs playing in 5 divisions, with a guideline of no more than 11 Clubs per division.\nChampions.\nSource:"

        "text": "The 2020–21 Northern Michigan Wildcats men's ice hockey season was the 45th season of play for the program and the 21st in the WCHA conference. The Wildcats represented Northern Michigan University and were coached by Grant Potulny, in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Northern Michigan's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nNorthern Michigan began the season poorly. In their first 14 games the team's only wins were against Ferris State, the worst team in the nation. Their 4–10 record included an 8-game losing streak and made it all but impossible for the Wildcats to make the NCAA Tournament without winning their conference championship. The team went through a great deal of changes, including Grant Loven transferring to St. Thomas mid-season and bringing in Rico DiMatteo after the new year. It was more than a month before DiMatteo made his first appearance for NMU but, once he did, the Wildcats' season completely turned around. DiMatteo helped Northern Michigan get the first win of the year that wasn't against FSU and then sweep a ranked Bemidji State team the very next weekend.\nThe team sagged at the end of the regular season, finishing 6th in the conference, and entered the WCHA Tournament with little hope of advancing. NMU gave #13 Bowling Green a surprise in the first game, winning 4–3, but when the Falcons roared back for a 5–0 victory in game two the series looked ready to be over. DiMatteo was shelled in the third game, facing a total of 40 shots in regulation, but he only allowed one by him while the Wildcat offense pumped 5 goals into the net and the team earned a surprising trip to the semifinals. The Wildcats were set against #3 Minnesota State and again pulled off a miraculous upset. The Wildcats fired 4 goals past the top goaltender in the nation and scored 5 in all before the Mavericks could even respond. The next day NMU was looking for the first championship in 29 years and only had Lake Superior State standing in their way. In the first ever postseason meeting between the two upper peninsula teams, Northern Michigan's magic ran out and they surrendered two goals in each period, losing the title game 3–6.\nJames Miller and John Roberts sat out the season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "
