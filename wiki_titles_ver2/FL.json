        "title": "Great Chebeague Golf Club",
        "text": "The Great Chebeague Golf Club is a country club at 16 Stone Wharf Road on Chebeague Island, Maine. It has a nine-hole golf course on more than on the north side of the island. Its clubhouse is a repurposed circa 1807 residence, which is probably one of the oldest buildings used for that purpose in the nation. The club was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.\nDescription and history.\nGreat Chebeague Island is an island community, set on the eponymous island in Casco Bay, not far from the town of Yarmouth, of which the island is a part. The Great Chebeague Golf Club (GCGC) is located on the west side of the northern tip of the island, and is divided into two large parts by Stone Wharf Road, the principal access to a wharf serving the ferry to Cousins Island. The golf course has nine holes, and was laid out in the 1920s. It has retained features common to golf courses of that period, including narrow fairways and small greens. Portions of holes 1, 2, 4 and 5 are located north of Stone Wharf Road, overlooked by the Chebeague Island Inn, while the rest of the course, and the clubhouse, are located to its south.\nThe clubhouse is a c. 1807 (or possibly even older) 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape that was originally located roughly where the third fairway is. It was moved to its present, more central location in the property on a rocky outcrop, in 1928, and adorned with a wraparound porch in 1935. Despite its alteration for use as a clubhouse, the interior of the building retains a number of period features, including wide floorboards and fireplace mantels. Historical documentation and island oral histories place construction of the house at sometime between 1790 and 1807. Adjacent to the clubhouse is the small cemetery of the Keazer and Chandler families, which has four early 19th-century headstones.\nGreat Chebeague Island, the largest island in Casco Bay, was for much of the 19th century a home for workers in Maine's economically important granite trade, its residents working on ships that transported stone from nearby quarries all over the east coast of the United States. With the advent of steam propulsion, this business declined, and the island became a seaside resort community, visited by people from cities further south. Founded in 1920 (as a six-hole course), the GCGC was a significant element of the popularization of golf in the area."

        "title": "Sailing at the 2015 ASEAN Para Games",
        "text": "Sailing at the 2015 ASEAN Para Games was held at Marina Bay, Singapore, from 6 to 8 December 2015. There were initially 4 gold medals for the 4 boat classes: single-person dinghy - Hansa 2.3 Men and Hansa 2.3 Women; Open Hansa 303 (2-person dinghy) plus the International 2.4mR (single-person keelboat). Not enough countries entered for the 2.4mR class, so this event was cancelled.\nAll 3 boat classes had at least a pair of competitors trading leads with only 1 point to differentiate podium places. Tension reigned all the way to the final races coupled with extremely challenging light airs made Sailing at the 2015 ASEAN Para Games an unforgettable regatta.\nHistory.\nPara sailing debuted as a full medal sport in the 2009 ASEAN Para Games in Malaysia. Starting as a demonstration sport in 2005's 3rd ASEAN ParaGames, the Philippines, sailing was not included in the 2008 Thailand, 2011 Indonesia and 2014 Myanmar editions of the ASEAN Para Games. Due to Singapore's passion and extensive involvement in sailing for both abled and disabled participants, Sailing was included in the sport line up announced a year ahead of the games.\nAugust Preparations.\nTo gain expertise in the 2.4mR Paralympic-class keelboat, Singapore sent two APG sailors to the International Sailing Federation's first Paralympic Development Program clinic in Weymouth and Portland, Great Britain. The high cost and maintenance of the 2.4mR keelboat being a major factor why most developing ASEAN nations are unable to buy these boats proved also a reason there were insufficient sailors for the class to be included in the APG.\nLikewise to encourage more para sailing attendance in the 2015 ASEAN Para Games, SDSC and the Singapore Sailing Federation held a pre-Games sailing training camp at Raffles Marina. The camp attended by 12 sailors from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, also took part in friendly racing with Sailability SDSC sailors, in the annual Western Circuit Sailing Regatta. Newbie sailors experienced fleet racing for the first time while more experienced veterans sussed out the competition, in order to train more efficiently for the sailing in the December Games.\nChallenges.\nSailing is usually held far from land, and therefore a mysterious sport to the general public. To drum up public involvement, organisers opted for the \"stadium\" sailing format. Marina Bay had been one of the sailing venues for the 2015 Extreme Sailing Series and also the recent 2015 SEAGames, therefore it was the ideal venue to bring sailing closer to the viewing public.\nHowever the 2015 ASEAN Para Games which traditionally should have begun 2 weeks after the SEAGames ended, was moved to December to cap Singapore's 50's anniversary celebrations. The December dates also coincided with Singapore's rainy season. Races were delayed or cancelled due to bad weather, with the Hansa 2.3 Women's fleet and the Hansa 303 fleets suffering the most on Day 3 with terrific delays and searing heat from morning to late afternoon. Throughout the 3 day regatta, wind speeds averaged 4 knots with surprise thrilling gusts on a sunny Day 2 briefly reaching about 15 knots before dropping to near nothing. The tall buildings and the concrete apron of Marina Bay created unusual sailing conditions that tested the sailors tremendously.\nRace organisers had to move buoys in the shifty winds which further delayed scheduled races (see official communications). Timely weather reports had on-water safety boats rounding up sailors to return to the dock and hustle everyone into shore shelter, before lightning and thunderstorms hit the sailing area of Marina Bay.\nRace management.\nThe sailing organization was excellently handled by the Singapore Sailing Federation and Singapore Disability Sports Council, in partnership with the APG Organising Committee (SAPGOC). Enthusiastic sailing volunteers helped launch or retrieve boats, assisted wheelchair-using sailors to safely traverse the ramp to the floating dock on the Bayfront, brought packed lunches and ran many errands so sailors could concentrate on their game.\nMedical assistance was keenly on standby, with safety precautions in place to constantly remind sailors, organisers and spectators to keep well hydrated. No medical incidents required aid.\nPRO:\nJury:\nTechnical Delegate:\nMeasurer: \nClassifiers:\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 18 athletes from 4 nations competed in para sailing at the 2015 ASEAN Para Games.\nFuture Developments.\nPre-regatta sailing workshops conducted by SDSC and Sailability Singapore helped jumpstart ASEAN interest in sailing in 2006. Malaysia likewise logging similar Paralympic Sailing expertise means sailing is definitely included in the succeeding ASEAN Para Games in Malaysia (2017) and the Philippines (2019). Vietnam fielded a new batch of sailors to this APG while Indonesia and Thailand have indicated interest to organize their para sailing in 2016, starting with the Bali International Sailing Regatta 2016 as a pathway leading to elite para sailing development."

Nonetheless, it attracted a then record crowd of 54,290 for a World Cup final, though it wasn't the record World Cup attendance as the second match of the tournament between Australia and Great Britain (won 25-10 by Australia) had drawn 62,256 to the SCG, a record that would not fall until 73,631 attended the 1992 World Cup final at Wembley Stadium.\nBackground.\nThe 1968 Rugby League World Cup was the fourth staging of the Rugby League World Cup since its inauguration in 1954, and the first since the 1960 tournament.

        "title": "1974 FIM Motocross World Championship",
        "text": "The 1974 FIM Motocross World Championship was the 18th FIM Motocross Racing World Championship season.\nSummary.\nHeikki Mikkola claimed his first 500cc world championship in a season-long battle with three-time world champion Roger De Coster that wasn't decided until the final Grand Prix of the season. The 250cc world championship ended in controversy as Russian riders used questionable riding tactics to secure the championship for Gennady Moiseyev over Jaroslav Falta.\n500cc Class.\nMikkola and De Coster dominated the series winning 17 of the 22 races as they competed for the premier division in motocross racing. Suzuki hired former privateer, Gerrit Wolsink to be De Coster's teammate. Former world champion, Bengt Åberg, left Husqvarna to join the Bultaco factory racing team. Brad Lackey replaced the departed Åberg, joining Mikkola and Arne Kring on the Husqvarna team while, Christer Hammargren left Husqvarna to replace Lackey on the Kawasaki team. Maico returned with the 1973 500cc championship runner-up, Willy Bauer and 35-year-old Adolf Weil, while the Yamaha team was represented by Jaak van Velthoven and Åke Jonsson.\nThe season began at the Austrian Grand Prix where Husqvarna's Mikkola won both races while De Coster's Suzuki had engine problems in the first race then suffered a flat tire in the second moto. Mikkola continued his winning streak with two more victories at the French Grand Prix, relegating De Coster to second in both races. Mikkola won a fifth consecutive moto at the Danish Grand Prix while De Coster retired with a loose exhaust pipe. \nDe Coster finally scored his first moto win with a second moto victory in Denmark, holding Mikkola to second place. In the Czechoslovakian Grand Prix, Mikkola took a victory in the first race and, was leading the second race when it began to rain causing him to crash three times, allowing De Coster to take the victory. At the halfway point of the season, Mikkola and De Coster had accounted for all of the race wins with Mikkola winning 7 motos to De Coster's 3 wins.\nAt the German Grand Prix, Mikkola injured his ribs during practice and missed the race, allowing Maico rider, Adolf Weil to finally break the monopoly with a win in the first race at his home Grand Prix while De Coster finished in fourth place. A malfunctioning front brake caused De Coster to crash in the second race while his Suzuki teammate, Gerrit Wolsink took the win. Three weeks later at the British Grand Prix, Mikkola was back in action however, a bent brake pedal in a first turn crash forced him out of the race. De Coster was leading the race when his rear suspension broke and led to his retirement, allowing Yamaha rider Jaak van Velthoven to claim the victory. De Coster came back to win the second race while Mikkola once again was involved in a first turn crash with Weil putting him in last place. In a display of determination, Mikkola fought his way through the pack and into third place after 10 laps. \nThe series then crossed the Atlantic for the United States Grand Prix with Mikkola holding a 25-point lead in the standings. De Coster had suffered mechanical breakdowns while leading five races. In the first moto, Wolsink held the lead before allowing his teammate De Coster to pass him and collect maximum championship points three laps from the finish. Mikkola rode the last four laps with a flat tire to salvage a fourth-place finish. De Coster was hindered by a damaged front wheel hub in the second race while his teammate Wolsink barely held off a charging Mikkola to win the race by a one-foot margin and deny Mikkola valuable championship points. An exhausted Wolsink collapsed from his bike immediately after crossing the finish line.\nBack in Europe for the Dutch Grand Prix, Mikkola and De Coster traded moto wins in the exhausting deep, sand track at Markelo. Going into the final two events of the season, Mikkola held a 10-point lead meaning that De Coster would have to win three of the last four motos to secure his fourth consecutive 500cc world championship. \nThe setting of the Belgian Grand Prix was a rugged, narrow track in the forests surrounding the picturesque hilltop Citadel of Namur. First held in 1947, the Namur circuit was known as the Monaco of the motocross grand prix circuit in reference to the prestigious Formula One race. \nWolsink took the lead at the start of the first race while Mikkola and De Coster battled their way to the front of the pack. When Wolsink's engine seized, the two series points leaders once again found themselves first and second with Mikkola holding on to the lead to the end of the race. De Coster had to win the final three races to overtake Mikkola for the championship. Wolsink once again grabbed the early lead in the second race but, soon crashed allowing De Coster into the lead with Mikkola in second place. De Coster continued to widen his lead to win the second moto to extend the championship points battle to the final race of the season in Luxembourg. In the first race, De Coster worked his way through the pack to take the lead before his Suzuki suffered an engine problem forcing him out of the race. Mikkola took over the lead and won the race to clinch his first world championship.\nDe Coster's Suzuki suffered mechanical breakdowns while he was leading five races, Mikkola's Husqvarna showed a perfect mechanical reliability by finishing every race. Mikkola credited much of his success to his Husqvarna factory mechanic, Per-Olaf Persson, whose meticulous preparation and maintenance greatly improved the reliability of his motorcycle.\n250cc Class.\nThe 250cc championship was a battle between Soviet KTM rider Gennady Moiseyev and Czech ČZ rider Jaroslav Falta which ended in controversy at the final race of the season. Moiseyev won the first moto and took the overall victory at the season opening Spanish Grand Prix. Falta won both races at the Italian Grand Prix followed with a win in the first moto of his home Grand Prix in Czechoslovakia but, then suffered two breakdowns in Poland while Moiseyev won both races. Falta won a moto in Yugoslavia and at the halfway point of the season, he trailed the Russian rider by 20 points. Each rider took a second place at the West German Grand Prix but, Falta won a moto at the Dutch Grand Prix to close the points gap to 5 points going into the final race of the season in Switzerland.\nFalta took the lead in the first race and appeared to be heading for victory while Moiseyev was being slowed by a rear suspension failure. When Falta came upon the slowing Russian rider and tried to pass him, the KTM rider made an attempt to obstruct him allowing second and third place riders, Harry Everts and Håkan Andersson to catch up. When Falta attempted to pass Moiseyev, the Russian rider collided with him causing him to fall off his bike. Falta was quickly able to remount but, finished the race in third place. Falta had to win the final moto to have any chance to claim the world championship. \nAs the final race began, Falta once again jumped into the lead while Moiseyev was forced to retire on the seventh lap. When Falta came upon two Russian riders, Victor Popenko and Eugeny Rybaltchenko, they appeared to attempt to block him. As Falta tried to pass them, Rybaltchenko rode into him, knocking him down. He remounted in third place as race officials waved the black flag at the two Russian riders, disqualifying them from the race. Falta was able to catch up and pass Everts and Gaston Rahier to recapture the lead and win the race, apparently clinching the world championship. However two hours after the conclusion of the race, jury officials penalized Falta one minute for jumping the start which dropped him to eighth place handing the world championship to Moiseyev.\nFinal standings.\n500cc.\nPoints are awarded to the top 10 classified finishers.\nSources:\n250cc.\nSource:\nPoints are awarded to the top 10 classified finishers."

        "title": "Dangerous Golf",
        "text": "Dangerous Golf is a miniature golf game developed by Three Fields Entertainment, a studio formed by former Criterion Games founders and developers Fiona Sperry and Alex Ward. The game, as stated by the studio, is a mix of \"Burnout\", \"Black\", and \"NBA Jam\", in which players attempt to cause the most destruction by playing miniature golf within a confined space, such as a china shop or a kitchen. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in June 2016.\nGameplay.\n\"Dangerous Golf\" features around one hundred different miniature golf holes situated in spaces with many destructible objects, including a china shop, a kitchen, a bathroom, a gas station, and a palace. Players take turns to try to hit their ball into the hole, but points (in the form of monetary value) are awarded for making trick shots, and for destroying as many of the objects in the room as possible. Further, players have the opportunity to turn their golf ball into a \"SmashBreaker\", a miniature bomb to cause even more damage, if they destroy enough objects with their shot. Other obstacles include courses that include multiple rooms, the use of teleporters, and special objectives that score more points if the player meets them. Failure to sink the ball into the hole's cup in the fixed number of shots will deduct a large monetary value from the player's score.\nThe game supports a party mode for up to eight players online, as well as local multiplayer.\nDevelopment.\nThe founders of Three Fields are Fiona Sperry and Alex Ward, the founders and developers at Criterion Games who worked on both the \"Burnout\" and \"Need for Speed\" series. Sperry considered \"Burnout\" as one of the more enjoyable and popular games they had developed, particular its Crash modes and the mini-game \"Burnout Crash!\", where the goal was to drive a car into an area and cause as much destruction as possible. When Criterion, after its purchased by Electronic Arts, moved away from the \"Burnout\" series and dedicated more staff towards \"Need for Speed\", Sperry and Ward opted to leave the company in late 2013. After waiting out the termination of their contracts, they then formed Three Fields, along with another Criterion developer Paul Ross. More former Criterion staff would follow: as of May 2016, nine of the eleven developers at Three Fields are former Criterion developers. The name Three Fields is based on the notion that all the founding employees had skills within all three fields of their business, design, art and engineering.\nThree Fields was formed with the intent to create a spiritual successor to the \"Burnout\" series on their own. Though this was their long-term goal, they did not anticipate that a game like \"Dangerous Golf\" would be their first title as a new studio, but found later that this would be a useful step towards their larger goals. Three Fields wanted to make a game that was similar to an arcade game, that was fast and fun. The idea of a golf game came from the documentary \"The Short Game\", about 7- and 8-year old golfers, and from videos from the \"Dude Perfect\" YouTube channel that featured seemingly-impossible basketball trick shots. The three recognized that a golf game centered around trick shots alongside the destruction they wanted from \"Burnout\" was an ideal concept. The concept was \"stupid\" and \"ridiculous\" for a golf game in the same manner that \"Burnout\" had been for racing games, being a light-hearted scoring challenge with much destruction. Similar arcade-style sports video games like \"NBA Jam\" served as some inspiration for \"Dangerous Golf\" in how to present a sports game that wasn't focused on the sports aspect.\nPrototyping for the game started with the palace concept with all the fine china that would be present, however they also took inspiration from the movie \"Clerks\" to come up with the idea of a gas station/convenience store as a setting. Ward noted they wanted to make a level taking place in a bakery shop, inspired by the Magnolia Bakery chain in New York, but believed they would have difficulty in simulating the destruction of foodstuffs for their first development effort, and see its potential as a future goal for the company. The amount of destruction they envisioned also helped them to recognize the capabilities of modern hardware to model and render detailed destruction, physics, and liquid interactions, the central element that would be needed in a \"Burnout\" successor. While a mobile game would have potentially given them the same lessons while also being an easier target for their small team, they felt they needed to be on the computer and console platforms, enabled by the capabilities of new Application programming interfaces provided by Epic Games and Nvidia. The team had originally started development using the Unity engine, but about ten months in switched to Epic's Unreal 4 engine which had more powerful capabilities for the game. Though none of the developers had worked with that engine before, they had technical help from developers at Epic's Guildford office. Additional middleware includes Nvidia's PhysX and APEX systems, and they further reviewed SIGGRAPH papers to find methods to better simulate and render the destruction caused by the player in a realistic manner.\nDevelopment of \"Dangerous Golf\" has been wholly supported by personal funds from the company's founders, and they have not sought any publisher to aid in finances. According to Three Fields, if the game is successful enough for the company, they will begin working on their next project: a racing game. The developers announced that they had started work on this next project in July 2016.\n\"Dangerous Golf\" was originally set to be released in May 2016, but subsequently delayed; the game was released on 3 June 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.\nOn release, the game had received criticism for some lacking features, such as a lack of keyboard and mouse controls. Three Fields has patched the game to addressed and add new features; a patch in July 2016 included adding an introductory tutorial video voiced by Ted Stryker, who had done similar narration for \"Burnout 3\".\nReception.\n\"Dangerous Golf\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic."

        "text": "The 2016 Super League Grand Final was the 19th official Grand Final and conclusive and championship-deciding match of the Super League XXI season. It was held on Saturday 8 October 2016, at Old Trafford, Manchester, with a 6pm kick-off time. British rock band Feeder provided the pre-match and half-time entertainment. The Wigan Warriors were crowned champions, winning their fourth Super League crown, and prevented Warrington from winning their first championship in 61 years.\nBackground.\nRoute to the Final.\nWarrington Wolves.\nWarrington took part in the Challenge Cup final, when they went down 12–10 against Hull FC. Then in the rematch of the final, Warrington won 23–6 to win the League Leader's Shield. They then beat St. Helens for only the 2nd time at the Halliwell Jones Stadium to clinch the first Final spot.\nWigan Warriors.\nWigan were quieter than usual this season, however in the back end of the season Wigan fought back to finish second by beating Hull F.C. and Warrington Wolves away. Drawn at home to Hull F.C. at the semi-final Wigan won 28–18 to set up the final against Warrington.\nMatch day.\nPre-game.\nThe match was a rematch of the 2013 Super League Grand Final, where Wigan won the trophy after trailing at half-time. This is Wigan's fourth consecutive Grand Final appearance. Warrington have been in the Grand Final twice before and have never won the Super League trophy, with their last league trophy win coming 61 years ago in the 1954–55 Northern Rugby Football League season.\nWigan were underdogs coming into this match as a host of their regular players were missing through injury. Players such as Sam and Joel Tomkins, Michael McIlorum, Dominic Manfredi, and Lee Mossop. Skipper Sean O'Loughlin was also amongst this list but was rushed into the team for the Grand Final and was placed on the bench after two 'successful' training sessions. Warrington's Chris Sandow was also a late inclusion for the Grand Final after he recovered enough to play, however he also started the game on the reserves bench.\nThis was the last rugby league match for Wigan's Josh Charnley before heading off to play rugby union. Teammate, Lewis Tierney, son of 1998 Super League Grand Final winner and dual-international, Jason Robinson, created history by becoming the first son to play in a Grand Final after his father did. Notably, Oliver Gildart's father Ian Gildart had also won various silverware with Wigan, but this was prior to the Super League era.\nMatch details.\nFirst half.\nWigan opened the scoring in the 8th minute with a penalty goal from Matty Smith due to teammate, John Bateman, being held too long in a tackle.\nIn the 17th minute, Wigan dotted the ball on the line out wide with Charnley, however the try wasn't awarded, due to a flick from Gelling which went forward due to pressure from Warrington's defence. This was Wigan's only notable effort in the first half as errors, such as this one, from both teams cost them opportunities.\nHowever, in the 21st minute, Warrington did score, thanks to a try from Declan Patton, who was only making his 9th appearance of the season. He then converted his own try to give his team a 6–2 lead, which they'd hold onto until half-time.\nSecond half.\nIn the 54th minute, Ryan Atkins made his way over the try-line for Warrington. However, referee Robert Hicks sent the final decision to Video Referee Ben Thaler, as he couldn't see whether or not the ball was grounded on the try-line, after 5 Wigan players were tackling Atkins. Eventually after a short delay, Hicks' initial TRY decision was overturned by video referee, Ben Thaler, due to Atkins seen losing control of the ball before he could get it down.\nA minute later, Liam Farrell broke Warrington's defensive line, and then gave a pass off to Oliver Gildart, who'd go on to score the 100th Super League Grand Final try. After kicking from a wide angle, Matty Smith was unable to convert and the scores remained level.\nIn the 63rd minute, Josh Charnley wasn't denied this time around, scoring after grounding the departing team member Dan Sarginson's grubber in the in-goal area. Matty Smith again had to convert from out wide, but he again failed to capitalise on the extra 2 points.\nSmith then finally added another two points, courtesy of a penalty goal, conceded by Daryl Clark. The penalty-goal made the score 12–6 to Wigan with only 6 minutes remaining. After this moment, all the chances belonged to Warrington, but Wigan's defence stood up when it mattered most, tackling players out of play and tackling them on the 5th tackle, to create a turnover each time. Wigan held on to win their 4th Super League title.\nPost-match.\nWigan's victory was their fourth Super League title.\nLiam Farrell won the Harry Sunderland Trophy/ Man of the Match award \nThe match was also the last for SkySports commentator, and former Great Britain international, Stevo, after 26 years of commentating the sport.\nWorld Club Series.\nBy winning this match Wigan had qualified for the World Club Series Final, to be played at DW Stadium against the winners of the 2016 NRL Grand Final, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. Warrington, as the runners up, would play 2016 NRL Grand Final runners up Melbourne Storm at the Halliwell Jones Stadium. The third game would have seen Challenge Cup champions Hull F.C. take on Canberra Raiders at KCOM Stadium. However circumstances later dictated that only Wigan and Warrington would play games, against Cronulla and Brisbane Broncos respectively."

        "text": "The International Ski Federation (FIS) Alpine Skiing World Cup is the premier circuit for alpine skiing competition. The inaugural FIS World Cup season launched in January 1967 and this 51st season began on 22 October 2016 in Sölden, Austria, and concluded in the United States at Aspen on 19 March 2017. The biennial World Championships interrupted the tour in early February in Saint Moritz, Switzerland. The season-ending finals in March were held in North America for the first time in two decades: the last finale in the U.S. was in 1997 at Vail.\nChief Race Director for the WC Tour, Markus Waldner, offered his pre-season thoughts on the pending 2016-17 tour in an early October interview. He addressed: early season scheduling and weather considerations, the growing global interest in alpine skiing beyond the core market in Europe and Scandinavia, the balance between what disciplines were scheduled and the marketability concerns each present, course construction that is safely competitive and manages risk, and a new change to regulation that allows top qualifiers to pick their starting position across a much wider range of bibs between 1 and 19.\nFormer overall World Cup champion Tina Maze of Slovenia, who missed the entire 2015-16 World Cup season, retired in January 2017. At the end of the season, former two-time overall World Cup champion Bode Miller of the United States, who had not raced in the last two seasons, also officially retired.\nWomen.\nThe women typically have had technical events in the U.S. in late November in Colorado at Aspen, but instead stopped this season in Vermont at Killington for its first effort as a World Cup venue. The most recent World Cup races in the Eastern U.S. were over a quarter century earlier, in March 1991 at Waterville Valley Resort, New Hampshire and the last World Cup races in Vermont were in 1978 at Stratton Mountain Resort. The women also had two Olympic venue orientation speed events in South Korea at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre in March, which produced identical podiums led by Sofia Goggia.\nInjuries continued to affect several of the top racers. Two-time overall champion Anna Veith (née Fenninger) and three-time overall champion Lindsey Vonn both missed the first half of the season due to injuries suffered during the previous season, although both returned by mid-January and competed in the World Championships in early February. However, Veith then missed the end of the season as well to recover further from her injuries. In addition, defending overall champion Lara Gut suffered a season-ending injury during the World Championships, costing her a chance to repeat.\nAt the end of the season, Mikaela Shiffrin, who also won the slalom discipline for the fourth time and was second in the giant slalom, became the third American woman and fifth American overall to win the overall World Cup championship, joining men's champions Phil Mahre and Bode Miller and women's champions Tamara McKinney and Vonn. Additionally, women's super G champion Tina Weirather became a second-generation discipline champion, as her father (Harti Weirather) was downhill discipline champion in 1981 and both her mother (Hanni Wenzel) and uncle (Andreas Wenzel) won the overall World Cup championship. Weirather and her mother thus became the first mother-daughter pair to win season trophies in World Cup competition.\nNations Cup.\nOverall\nMen\nWomen"

        "title": "Women's Cricket Super League",
        "text": "The Women's Cricket Super League (WCSL), known as the Kia Super League (KSL) for sponsorship reasons, was a semi-professional women's Twenty20 cricket competition in England and Wales operated by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The competition featured six franchise teams, partnered with a variety of county teams and boards and universities, and was envisaged as a means to bridge the gap between amateur domestic cricket and the increasingly professional international game.\nThe WCSL launched in 2016, with each team playing five group stage matches in a round-robin format, followed by a finals day; this was increased to ten group matches in 2018, following the ECB abandoning their initial plans to expand the tournament by also incorporating a 50-over competition.\nThe WCSL ended after the 2019 season, ahead of the intended launch of the ECB's new format, The Hundred, and its city-based men's and women's franchises. Western Storm ended the competition as the most successful team with two titles, in 2017 and 2019. Southern Vipers and Surrey Stars won one title each, in 2016 and 2018 respectively.\nHistory.\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced their plans for the Women's Cricket Super League in June 2015, stating they would invest £3 million over four years. The competition would launch with six teams playing in a Twenty20 format, with the initial intention to add a 50-over competition in 2017. The ECB received 28 applications to host teams in the first stage of bidding, with the process subsequently moving to an interview stage. The six successful bids were announced in January 2016. The ECB hoped that the WCSL would develop as a semi-professional competition, with the intention of bridging the gap between the amateur Women's County Championship and international cricket, for which England players are centrally contracted as professionals.\nIt was decided in advance of the 2017 season that the planned 50-over competition would not after all take place, with the ECB and the franchises preferring to concentrate their resources on developing the existing Twenty20 format. For the 2018 season, the group stage of the competition was doubled in size, with each of the teams now facing each other home and away for a total of ten group matches.\nIn 2018, the ECB announced the planned launch of The Hundred in 2020, a new hundred-ball format competition to be played by newly-created city-based franchises with both men's and women's teams. In conjunction with this, it was also announced that the WCSL would be scrapped after the 2019 season. It was replaced with a new regional domestic structure for women's cricket in England and Wales, encompassing The Hundred, the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy and the Charlotte Edwards Cup.\nTeams.\nThe ECB announced the six hosts for the WCSL in January 2016, with hosting rights awarded for four years of the competition, 2016 to 2019 inclusive. The hosts and partners included seven First-class counties, five minor counties and three universities. Team names, along with the fixtures and venues for the 2016 season, were announced in February 2016. The allocation of England players to the teams was announced in April 2016, with overseas player allocations being announced later that month.\nFormat.\nMatches were played in a Twenty20 format. Teams played each other in a round robin, from which the top three teams qualified for Finals Day at a neutral venue. In 2016 and 2017 teams played each other once, and in 2018 and 2019 teams played each other twice. The second and third placed teams then met in the semi-final for the right to face the first placed team in the final. Finals Day was staged at the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford in 2016 and at the County Cricket Ground, Hove from 2017 to 2019.\nMedia coverage.\nThe 2016 tournament was not televised, but seven group matches and the finals day were broadcast live on BBC radio's \"Test Match Special\". In 2017, Sky Sports broadcast eight matches live – six group stage matches as part of double-headers with a men's T20 Blast match, followed by both finals day matches. They broadcast twelve live matches from the expanded 2018 competition.\nSponsorship.\nThe ECB announced a two-year title sponsorship agreement for the WCSL with Kia Motors in March 2016, as a result of which the competition was known as the Kia Super League. The deal was extended to cover the final two years of the competition in 2017."

        "text": "Joan of Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, Maiden of Orleans, is an outdoor copy of Emmanuel Frémiet's equestrian statue \"Jeanne d'Arc\" (1874), installed in Portland, Oregon's Laurelhurst neighborhood, in the United States. The bronze sculpture, which depicts Joan of Arc, was donated to the city by Henry Waldo Coe, who saw Frémiet's original statue in Paris. Portland's copy arrived from France in 1924 and was dedicated on Memorial Day in 1925 in honor of the Doughboys of World War I.\nDescription.\n\"Joan of Arc\" is an outdoor equestrian statue installed in Coe Circle, at the intersection of Northeast Cesar E. Chavez Blvd. (formerly 39th) and Glisan, in Portland's Laurelhurst neighborhood. The sculpture is one of several copies of Emmanuel Frémiet's 1874 gilded bronze statue, \"Jeanne d'Arc\", which is installed at the Place des Pyramides in Paris.\nPortland's statue is also made of bronze and measures approximately x x . The flag held by Joan of Arc is made of copper. The statue rests on a granite base that measures approximately x x . The tax conservation commission did not allow for the cost of the granite base that the statue sits upon to be paid for by the city of Portland so, both Dr. Coe’s Wife and mother paid for the $4000 granite base. To choose the design for the base the city art commission and the Portland chapter of architects held a contest. Margaret Goodin Fritsch, the first woman to graduate from the School of Architecture at University of Oregon, won first place and her design was chosen. The granite base itself was made by Blaesing Granite works.\nHistory.\nThe statue was added to Coe Circle in 1925. It was one of four statues given by Henry Waldo Coe to the City of Portland. It was made from the original molds of Frémiet's statue, which Coe saw on a visit to France. Portland's statue arrived from France in 1924 and was dedicated on Memorial Day, May 30, 1925, honoring the Doughboys of World War I. Dr. Coe chose to gift a statue of Joan of Arc because she was the patron saint of the Doughboys while they fought in Europe during World War I. It is reported that the Doughboys would sing Joan of Arc, They Are Calling You as they marched into battle. Dr. Coe is quoted as saying the singing of this song, “...had much to do in reviving the drooping spirits of the French and bringing victory out of defeat” and at the unveiling ceremony of the statue the Royal Rosarian quartet sang that song.\nOver the years the gold leaf that brilliantly adorned the statue slowly deteriorated until there was no trace of its luster and the artwork was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's \"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\" program in 1993. In 2002, through the fundraising efforts and after receiving a grant for $24,000, the city of Portland was able to have the statue restored to its former glory. The pennant flag held in Joan’s right hand and the laurel wreath on her head were replaced and the gold leaf was restored."

Hosted by University of the East, the UST Glowing Goldies defeated the FEU Tamaraws in the best of three finals series two games to one taking their twelfth overall UAAP men's basketball championship.\nElimination round.\nTournament format:\nTeams play a double round robin. The winner of the first round play the winner of the second round in a best of three championship to determine the champion. Ties for round winners are broken by knockout games.\nIf a team wins both rounds, it is automatically declared the champion, regardless if it was a sweep or not. If a team fails to win either rounds, but ends up with a better over-all record than either of the round winners, that team will challenge the second round winner for a championship slot against the first round winner.\nFinals.\nUST won Game 1, 60-55, but FEU forced the decider with a 69-58 win. Ceferino dela Paz scored the marginal points as UST frustrated FEU in the winner-take-all match, 71-68. The series was dubbed as the most exhilarating UAAP conquest in the post war featuring two players who would be future champion coaches of their respective schools: Aric del Rosario of UST, and Danny Gavieres of FEU."

        "title": "Ultra-distance cycling",
        "text": "The definition of ultra-distance cycling is far more vague than in ultra running (any race longer than a marathon) or in ultra-triathlon (any race longer than an Ironman Triathlon). Any bike race or ride longer than a century ride, which is , is sometimes considered to be ultra-distance cycling. However, such events are relatively common, so using a longer distance to define the category is more useful, such as any race or ride that is longer than , or even a double century, .\nBike events that cover these distances but which are split into stages do not fit most definitions of ultra-distance races – the clock needs to run continuously from start to finish. Even so, extra-long stages within a longer race may be long enough to be an ultra-distance race by themselves. In addition, any team events in which individual cyclists do not complete the full distance are not considered to be ultra-distance.\nBike races that can be described as ultra-distance are organized below according to the type or format of the race. This is not an exhaustive list of such races, but the longest, most important (as measured by the level of media interest), or most popular (as measured by the number of participants) races within each category are mentioned.\nTrack cycling.\nIn the early days of bicycle racing in the late 1800s, six-day racing on velodromes was popular. Only the original race format is a true ultra-distance cycling race as defined here because it was a simple test of how far an individual cyclist could ride during the six day-long event. The format evolved away from this to involve teams of two riding in a relay format. Later, the non-stop nature of the race was changed to only race during part of each day.\nRoad racing.\nProfessional.\nIn the early days of professional road bicycle racing there were many one-day road races and stages in grand tours that were much longer than those of today. Bordeaux–Paris in France was the longest one-day, annual professional bike race; it had a route of about and was run almost every year between 1891 and 1988. After 1988, the longest one-day professional bike race became Porto–Lisboa in Portugal, which was about long. Porto–Lisboa was last held in 2004, and Milan–San Remo in Italy has since then been the longest race at .\nParis–Brest–Paris was a professional bike race that covered a massive in France, and was only held every 10 years from 1891 until 1951, but has since continued as a randonneuring event (see below).\nCycling's grand tours used to include far longer stages than they do today. The longest ever Tour de France stage was in the 1919 Tour and that year every one of the 15 stages was more than long. The longest ever stage in the Giro d'Italia was in the 1914 Giro and that year 5 of the 8 stages were longer than . The Vuelta a España did not begin until 1935 and the first edition was when its longest-ever stage was held, which was . In modern grand tours, stages longer than are increasingly rare and the limit set by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) for any individual stage during a stage race is 240 km.\nSupported ultracycling races.\nThere are no longer any true ultra-distance bike races (i.e., that are longer than ) that are affiliated with cycling's main governing body, the UCI; most modern ultra-distance races are instead affiliated with the World Ultra-Cycling Association (WUCA). By far the best-known of these races is the Race Across America (RAAM), a non-stop race across the United States that covers .\nIn this format of racing, the cyclists race individually (drafting and group riding are not allowed) but each cyclist has at least one support vehicle and a team of support staff. This specific format of racing is often referred to as \"ultracycling\", which is why it would be incorrect to refer to all ultra-distance cycling as ultracycling. Many ultracycling races include a team category that operates in a relay format and so does not meet the criteria for an ultra-distance cycling race used here (in which individuals must ride the complete distance).\nOther ultracycling races include the Race ACross Europe (RACE), which is long. The oldest ultracycling race in Europe is the Glocknerman, an Austrian cycling event with a distance of that was first held in 1997. The Race Across The Alps is only long but contains over of climbing and so the organizers claim it to be the hardest one-day race in the world.\nThe first Race Across Russia was held in 2013 as a non-stop team relay event with a total distance of about between Moscow and Vladivostok. In 2015 it became the Red Bull Trans-Siberian Extreme with a solo category and the route was split into 15 separate stages, each between and long.\nRoad time trials.\n12-hour and 24-hour road cycling time trials have been around for a long time and are still common. In these events, cyclists attempt to ride the maximum distance possible within the time limit. The current 24 hour record is over on a traditional bicycle and over in a velomobile.\nIn 2014, the UMCA revived interest in the highest annual mileage record, which was last set in 1939 by Tommy Godwin at . This involves riding the maximum distance possible within a 12-month period. In early 2016, Kurt Searvogel broke the record, achieving a distance of in one year or per day. Since Kurt Searvogel's record year, Ms. Amanda Coker significantly surpassed Kurt's annual mileage record with a new record of over 86,000 miles in 365 days. Amanda continued on to break the record for fastest time to 100,000 miles, at approximately 420 days.\nSome ultra-distance time trials are held at permanent motorsport racetracks, such as Bike Sebring (Sebring International Raceway), Rad am Ring (Nürburgring), Monza 12h Cycling Marathon (Autodromo Nazionale Monza), Cycling Zandvoort 24h (Circuit Zandvoort), 24h BiCircuit Festival (Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya), and Revolve24 Endurance Cycling Challenge (Brands Hatch and The Bend Motorsport Park). These lack any road traffic and have smooth road surfaces.\nUnsupported ultracycling &amp; bikepacking road races.\nSome races have recently become popular that recall the early era of professional bike racing in which riders were unsupported and raced day and night. Among the most popular of these is the Transcontinental Race, which covers approximately across Europe and was inspired by the off-road US event Tour Divide. As in other ultra-cycling events there is a mass start, but in bikepacking races drafting is not allowed and all support is forbidden. There are no support vehicles and riders must find all of their supplies, accommodation, etc. from commercial sources along the route or bring it with them. Most events will, however, allow \"trail magic\" from strangers through kind actions, gifts, and other forms of encouragement so long as the \"magic\" does not move the bike. Other popular examples in this category include the Trans Am Bike Race of , and the IncaDivide, an event with a shorter distance of but that takes riders above in the Andes mountains of Peru. The latter is part of the BikingMan series, an ultra bikepacking race series that first took place in 2019 in Oman, France, Laos, Peru, Portugal and Taiwan with a standard distance of .\nIn Europe, the Transiberica, the Three Peaks Bike Race, and the Race Through Poland, all established in 2018, are major free-route unsupported races, covering distances from 1,500 up to 3,000 km.\nUnsupported rides are sometimes done as completely solo attempts outside of organized rides but are still well-publicized. These often involve riding point to point (including city to city), for example Vegas In 24.\nRandonneuring.\nRandonneuring events (also called brevets or audaxes) are generally non-competitive rides where racing is not the focus; they are ridden more as personal challenges. They also differ from most ultracycling and bikepacking races in that group riding and drafting is allowed, with limits. Supplies and accommodation are often provided by the organizers at intermediate checkpoints, but the use of support vehicles is not allowed outside of the checkpoints.\nThe most famous of this type of event is Paris-Brest-Paris in France, in which over 5,000 people attempt to complete the long route in under 90 hours. The randonnee version evolved from the professional bike race (see above) and is held every four years. There are many similar events of between and around the world, including London–Edinburgh–London in the UK and the Cascade 1200 in the USA. For a more complete list, see the page on randonneuring. There are also many more shorter-distance randonneuring rides, which are typically , , or long.\nCyclosportives/Gran fondos.\nCyclosportives (also known as gran fondos) are mass-participation cycling events. They are far less serious than pure bike races, but times are recorded and prizes are often awarded to the fastest people. The organizers normally provide full support in terms of marking the route and providing feed stations.\nThe event that proclaims itself to be the \"longest Granfondo in the world\" follows almost the same route as the professional Milan–San Remo bike race and is long. However, there are several similar events that are longer. Bordeaux–Paris was a professional race until 1988 and returned in 2014 as a cyclosportive with a route of about . Styrkeprøven Trondheim-Oslo is a long race and cyclosportive in Norway. The Tour du Mont Blanc is a long cyclosportive over mountainous terrain through France, Switzerland, and Italy. Slightly longer still is the Wysam 333 in Switzerland at . There is also the Mallorca 312, which is a long ride around the island of Mallorca, the Dragon Devil version of the Dragon Ride Wales cyclosportive in the UK is long, and the Vätternrundan cyclosportive that does a tour of the Swedish lake is long.\nIn New Zealand, there is the Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge. The standard cyclosportive option involves a single lap of the lake, which is long, but there are also options to do two laps in one day for , with no support on the first lap, or start one day earlier and do four laps, , which is more of a randonneuring-format event. Every second year there is also an 8 lap option, long, but a following support vehicle is required for that version making it more of an event.\nCentury rides.\nIn the US, organized century rides of are common, with the format falling between a cyclosportive and a randonnee. There are also many organized double centuries of , one of the more popular ones being the Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic, and at least one event even offers and options, the Los Angeles Wheelmen Grand Tour.\nOther road cycling records.\nThere are a few classic long-distance cycling routes for which time records are kept even though riders normally do not race simultaneously. These include Land's End to John o' Groats in the United Kingdom, which is about . On the longer end of the spectrum, there is Cairo to Cape Town in Africa, which is about . This record is currently held by Scottish endurance cyclist Mark Beaumont. The longest record of this format is the around the world cycling record, which requires the cyclist to cover by bike plus other requirements. In 2018, Scottish endurance cyclist Jenny Graham completed an unsupported circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle in 124 Days, 10 hours and 50 minutes. In 2012 and 2014, a mass-start event called the World Cycle Race was organized based on these rules.\nGravel biking.\nIn the early days of road bike racing, most roads were not paved, so most races were held primarily on unpaved/dirt/gravel roads. Due to road infrastructure improving with time, road bike racing is now done almost entirely on paved roads. However, in the 21st century, riding and racing road bikes on gravel roads has gained popularity, at least in part due to improvements in technology.\nBicycle technology is seen as the largest contributor to the popularity of gravel biking because technology has allowed designers to integrate key characteristics of bikes across disciplines into one bike. For instance, the relaxed geometry of mountain bikes is the foundation of gravel bike frames but gravel bikes are lighter, faster and more responsive than a mountain bike. Gravel bikes also use characteristics of both cyclocross and road bikes for better comfort on long rides and the wheel clearance to accommodate rides done in torrential conditions.\nThe culture of gravel biking has also been another reason it has grown in popularity. Gravel races rarely call for a team of coaches and bicycle technicians because the courses susceptible to varying weather that is hard to train and prepare for. Gravel riders are generally focused on getting through a course rather than maintaining a pace during races. This give way to camaraderie on the trail and caters to a fun and relaxed atmosphere that is not always present in road and mountain bike races.\nOne of the longest and most famous of the modern gravel bike races is Unbound Gravel (formerly called Dirty Kanza) in the Flint Hills around Emporia, Kansas, USA, which is long. In 2018, a race called the DKXL was added, and 25, 50, and 100 mile courses were added in 2013. In the UK, the Dirty Reiver is a off-road cycling challenge that takes place in Hexham, England.\nUnbound Gravel is a great example of how much gravel biking has grown in recent years for example, in 2006 there was a total of 34 riders that participated in the 200 mile race. In June 2019, 2,750 riders lucky enough to be picked from a lottery crossed the start line of the Dirty Kanza 200 and the fact that organizers had to introduce other mileage categories also shows that gravel biking is about the adventure.\nMountain biking.\nAs on the road, some of the most popular ultra-distance mountain bike events are 12 and 24-hour time trials, of which there are many all over the world. In addition, there are many mountain bike races of at least . Very few mountain bike races are longer than because the average speed on typical mountain biking terrain is much slower than that on the road.\n24 hour mountain bike races are where the bikepacking genre began, in which riders are entirely self-supported (see above for road-based bikepacking events). One of the most famous and popular off-road bikepacking events is the Tour Divide, which covers across the Rocky Mountains from Canada, through the US, and finishes at the Mexican border. The Iditarod Trail Invitational in Alaska is run on snow bikes in winter and is long. The most popular off-road bikepacking race in Europe is the Tuscany Trail, which covers in central Italy. Also in Italy, the Italy Divide starts at the Roman Coliseum and finishes at Lake Garda, passing through Siena, Florence and Bologna en route. It mixes technical mountain bike sections with gravel trails.\nIn Central Asia, the Silk Road Mountain Race takes place in Kyrgyzstan, and covers 1,700 km (1,056 mi) in the Tien Shan mountain range.\nThe Titan Desert is a six-day stage race held in Morocco with a total distance of over .\nIn Australia, the Race to the Rock is an unsupported race through the Outback founded by Jesse Carlsson. The course and length differs each year, but generally finishes at Uluru; the 2018 edition was 3,500 km (2,175 mi) in total, and covered sections of Southern Australia as well as Tasmania.\nClimbing-focused (Everesting).\nInstead of trying to maximize the distance ridden in one ride, some people try to maximize the height gained in one ride. Everesting is a challenge that involves repeatedly cycling up and down the same hill multiple times until the total height gain matches the height of Mount Everest, . There are also records for the most height gain achieved within a certain time period, for instance 24 hours.\nEveresting came to wider public attention during the height of the coronavirus pandemic when bored professional cyclists went in search of hills when the world tour was shut down."

His position of choice was wing three-quarter.\nBorn in Wellington in 1900, Ward was educated at Wellington College where he was a member of the 1st XV between 1917 and 1918. He died in Palmerston North in 1990, and was buried at Kelvin Grove Cemetery.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from secondary school Ward moved south and attended Otago University. In 1920 Ward was trialled to play at the Half-back position for his Otago Varsity team, but it was decided the position did not suit him. An unknown commentator stated: \"Ward is a brilliant individualist, a straight runner and fast. He should be played as a Wing Three-quarter\". This opinion would come true as Ward was selected on the wing for the All Blacks against the touring New South Wales side in Christchurch in 1921, making his debut at 21 years of age. He scored no points in this appearance.\nUnfortunately for Ward his Rugby career took a turn for the worse because of a serious knee injury suffered in 1922, which ultimately ended his career.\nPersonal.\nWard was one of three children of William Frederick Ward and Kate Gardiner McRae.\nHe worked as a medical practitioner in Palmerston North."

For the first time since 1989, no final was played, although both England and Ireland were undefeated going into their final match, making that a \"de facto\" final.

This is the last of 19 athletic championship events held by the conference in the 2015–16 academic year.\nClemson, under first year head coach Monte Lee, defeated defending champion Florida State in the championship game to win its 10th ACC Tournament championship, breaking a tie with Georgia Tech for most tournament titles. The title was Clemson's 15th overall ACC championship in baseball (also most all-time in the conference), its first ACC championship since 2006, and first tournament championship under the pool play format that began in 2007. The championship game, hampered by weather delays, took 9 hours and 20 minutes to complete, with first pitch being thrown at 11:02 A.M. and the final out recorded at 7:22 P.M.\nFormat and seeding.\nThe winner of each seven team division and the top eight other teams based on conference winning percentage, regardless of division, from the conference's regular season will be seeded one through ten. Seeds one and two are awarded to the two division winners. The bottom four seeds play an opening round, with the winners advancing to pool play. The winner of each pool plays a single championship.\nAll-Tournament Team.\n‡ - Tournament MVP"

The competition was held from October 2–8, 2017, at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nThe event marked the first time since 2003 that the Championships had been held in North America. Montreal was also the host of the 1985 World Championships and the 1976 Summer Olympics. The event was part of Montreal's 375th anniversary and Canada's 150th anniversary celebrations, both of which were in fall of 2017.\nCompetition schedule.\nAll times are EDT (UTC–4).\nMen's results.\nIndividual all-around.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nFloor.\nDue to a dead spot on the floor in the last subdivision of qualifications that allowed a rotation of gymnasts to redo their floor routines, Bram Verhofstad of the Netherlands bumped out the original eighth-place qualifier Tomás González of Chile.

        "text": "The 1988 Rugby League World Cup final was the conclusive game of the 1985–1988 Rugby League World Cup tournament and was played between New Zealand and Australia on 9 October 1988 at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand. Australia won the final by 25 points to 12 in front of a New Zealand rugby league record attendance of 47,363. Australia, the defending champions, won the Rugby League World Cup for the 6th time.\nBackground.\n\"1\" France's 1987 away fixtures against Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea were scratched and each team awarded two points as the French were unable to tour Australasia that year due to financial difficulties.\nNew Zealand.\nThe Tony Gordon coached New Zealand started their World Cup campaign on 7 July 1985 (under the coaching of Graham Lowe) when they defeated Australia 18–0 at Carlaw Park in Auckland. Until the Final, The Kiwis won another 3 games while losing 2 and drawing 1 for a 4-2-1 record.\nAustralia.\nAustralia began their World Cup campaign with a shock 18-0 loss to New Zealand in the third test of the 1985 Trans-Tasman series in Auckland on 7 July 1985 (under the coaching of 1977 World Cup final winning coach Terry Fearnley). The Don Furner coached Kangaroos would win another 5 games while losing 1 for a 5-2 record.\nHead to Head.\nThis would be the first time that New Zealand and Australia would meet in a World Cup final.\nHost venue.\nAustralia won the right to host the World Cup final. However, in the interests of rugby league, and with international attendances in Australia on the decline since the domination of the Kangaroos had begun a decade earlier, the Australian Rugby League (ARL) agreed to allow the New Zealand Rugby League (NZRL) to host the Final. Additionally, the Australian venues that would have been used, the 40,000 capacity Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) and the 32,500 capacity Lang Park in Brisbane were both smaller than the ultimate choice of Eden Park, while the 50,000 capacity Sydney Cricket Ground which had hosted the 1968 and 1977 World Cup finals was not considered as the ARL had moved its playing headquarters to the new Football Stadium in 1988.\nAt the time the largest rugby league venue in New Zealand was the 20,000 capacity Carlaw Park in Auckland. New Zealand's largest stadium, the 48,000 capacity Eden Park stadium in Auckland, the spiritual home of rugby union in New Zealand was chosen as the host venue. Eden Park had also hosted the 1987 Rugby World Cup final (attracting 48,035) giving it the distinction of being the only venue to host both the Rugby League and Rugby Union World Cup finals.\nThis would be the first rugby league match to be played at Eden Park since 1919. As of 2023 the attendance of 47,363 remains the record crowd for a rugby league match at the venue and the record attendance for a rugby league match in New Zealand, easily beating the recorded 28,000 attendance from 4 August 1928 when New Zealand had defeated England at Carlaw Park.\nMatch details.\nDespite Australia's successful Ashes defence against Great Britain earlier in the year, the inexperience of the Australian World Cup final team (and because NZ had defeated Australia in their previous encounter in a one-off test in Brisbane in 1987), saw the hosts actually go into the match as favourites in the eyes of many critics. However, the Wally Lewis led Kangaroos, boasting veteran test players Garry Jack, Dale Shearer, Michael O'Connor (a dual rugby international and the only member of the team to have previously played at Eden Park), Steve Roach, Paul Dunn, Wayne Pearce, and Terry Lamb, along with 1986 Kangaroos Benny Elias and Paul Sironen, mixed with newer international players Mark McGaw, Allan Langer, Gavin Miller, Andrew Farrar and David Gillespie, triumphed over the ill-disciplined Kiwis, who at least made sure the victorious Australians were bloodied and bruised for their victory lap. For the Kiwis, the Iro brothers Tony and Kevin, Gary Freeman, Clayton Friend, Mark Graham, Adrian Shelford, Kurt Sorensen and captain Dean Bell dished out the punishment.\nOther than the ill-discipline, some of the Kiwis had a game to forget. Gary Mercer at fullback missed first half tackles on Langer and Man of the Match Gavin Miller that led directly to each crossing for a try, while Langer simply stood him up and left him grasping at air to score his second of the first half, while Dean Bell dropped two balls in the first 20 minutes of the game (the second after a good break down the left flank by Freeman) that each time led to Australia scoring soon after.\nDespite the pre-game predictions, the Aussie's led 21–0 at half time and scored soon after the resumption of play as Dale Shearer stood up Wayne Wallace and strode over in the corner. O'Connor missed the conversion, and a further two penalty kicks and Australia's score remained at 25. From there the Kiwis mounted a mini comeback with the Iro brothers crossing for tries, but the Australian's had the game well in hand to claim their 6th World Cup crown and 3rd in succession after also winning the 1975 and 1977 tournaments.\nDespite Queensland having won the 1988 State of Origin series 3–0 over New South Wales earlier in the year and supplying the bulk of the players in The Ashes win over Great Britain, the Maroons only supplied three of Australia's 15 players for the World Cup final - captain Wally Lewis, Dale Shearer and Allan Langer. Lewis broke his right forearm in the 15th minute of the game while tackling Tony Iro, the Kiwi winger had tried to duck under Lewis' tackle and Wally's right forearm came into contact with Iro's head. With his arm hanging limp affecting his passing (including a pass from dummy half that literally just fell to the ground), Lewis bravely played on for another 25 minutes with the Kiwis targeting him in defence before Terry Lamb came on to replace him. Queenslander's missing from Australia's record 70–8 win over Papua New Guinea just over 2 months earlier were Mal Meninga (broken arm), Peter Jackson, Tony Currie, Greg Conescu, Wally Fullerton Smith and reserve forward Paul Vautin. Lewis later publicly claimed that it was the same as had been the case since State of Origin had started in 1980, Qld wins the series but it was mainly NSW players picked for Australia. The Australian team included nine players who had played in the 1988 NSWRL Grand Final a month earlier (4 from premiers Canterbury-Bankstown and 5 from runners up Balmain), plus a further four players who had played in the Finals series. Only Wally Lewis and Allan Langer had not played during the NSWRL Finals.\nAfter taking over the Kangaroos coaching role in 1986 and compiling a 13–2 win–loss record, this would be Don Furner's last game as coach of the Australian team. From 1989 the Australian coach would be former test captain and Manly-Warringah's 1987 premiership winning coach Bob Fulton.\nBroadcast.\nThe match was broadcast into Australia by the Nine Network with commentary from Darrell Eastlake, Ray Warren and special comments from five time Sydney premiership winning \"Supercoach\" Jack Gibson with Michael Cronin, Australia's record test point scorer and a World Cup winner in 1975 and 1977, the sideline reporter."

        "text": "The 1995 Rugby League World Cup final was the conclusive game of the 1995 Centenary World Cup tournament and was played between England and Australia on 28 October 1995 at the Wembley Stadium in London, England. Australia won the final by 16 points to 8 in front of 66,540 fans. Australia, the defending champions, won the Rugby League World Cup for the 8th time.\nThe pre-match entertainment for the Final was provided by British rock group Status Quo.\nBackground.\n1995 was the year of the Super League war, with the new Super League causing a split in Australia. As a result, the Australian Rugby League did not select any player who had signed with Super League (though they did not stand in the way of any SL aligned country from selecting players who were playing in Australia). As 100% of Australia's squad was sourced from Australian Rugby League-aligned players, several test players from the successful 1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France were not selected for the World Cup, though a number of the team had played in the 3-0 Trans-Tasman Test series win over New Zealand earlier in the year.\nAfter being overlooked for representative games during the year, Super League aligned Canberra Raiders players Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Steve Walters, Bradley Clyde, Brett Mullins and David Furner, took the ARL to court during 1995 in a bid to be able to play in the World Cup. The courts found in their favour and ordered the ARL to consider all players for selection regardless of who they were aligned to. However, as one unnamed ARL official was quoted as saying, the ARL were only forced to consider Super League players, not select them. Just how many, if any, Super League players were actually considered for selection remains unknown and speculation remains that behind closed doors no Super League player was actually considered for selection.\nWithout the Super League players, many thought that the Kangaroos would be a second-string side despite their series whitewash over the SL aligned New Zealand earlier in the year.\nEngland.\nEngland, coached by Phil Larder and captained by Wigan's Denis Betts, had surprised in the opening game of the tournament when they defeated Australia 20–16 at Wembley. England won all three of their group matches.\nEngland defeated Wales 25–10 in the Semi-final at Old Trafford to advance to the Final.\nAustralia.\nThe Bob Fulton coached, Brad Fittler captained Australians began their World Cup defense with shock 20–16 loss to England at Wembley in the opening game of the World Cup. After this the Kangaroos remained undefeated including a then world record 86–6 win over rugby league minnows South Africa.\nAustralia defeated New Zealand 30–20 in the Semi-final at the McAlpine Stadium in Huddersfield. The game had gone into extra-time after the score was locked at 20-all at the end of the regulation 80 minutes.\nMatch details.\n1st half.\nEngland won the coin toss and Australia's Andrew Johns kicked off the match. In England's first set with the ball Australia were penalised for their skipper Brad Fittler's high tackle on Andrew Farrell. From the resulting good field position England were able to force a line drop-out and get another set of six in Australia's half of the field when Brett Dallas was judged to have caught the ball in the field of play before being tackled by Paul Newlove. At the end of the second set, Radlinski put up a high kick, which Australia's fullback Tim Brasher failed to secure and Jim Dymock was penalised for regathering the ball when off-side (the referee ruled that Brasher had knocked on, though replays suggested Martin Offiah got a hand to the ball). Bobbie Goulding kicked the penalty goal from fifteen metres out, giving his side a 2–0 lead. From Australia's resulting kick-off, Andy Farrell tried to trap the ball with his foot but it bounced off upfield and with his teammates failing to react, it was regathered by Andrew Johns only two metres out from the English try line. On the last tackle of the ensuing set, Johns at first receiver put a perfectly weighted grubber kick into the left-hand corner of England's in-goal area where winger Rod Wishart dived in and got a hand on it, giving Australia the first try of the match in the seventh minute. Johns then converted the try from the touch-line and the Kangaroos were leading 6–2. A few minutes later England were penalised around the centre of the field and Johns attempted the kick at goal but missed. With the game now swinging from end to end, Johns conceded a penalty close to the goal posts and Goulding's kick bounced off the uprights but went in, so England were trailing 4–6 by the eighteenth minute. A few minutes later England conceded a penalty in front of their goal posts and Johns kicked Australia to an 8–4 lead. Shortly after, Martin Offiah made a break from 15 metres inside his own half and raced 60 metres down along the left sideline with Dallas and Steve Menzies (a second row forward who almost ran down the flying winger) in pursuit and was contentiously ruled to have been taken over the sideline 5 metres out by a desperate Tim Brasher tackle as he threw the ball back into the field for Paul Newlove to toe ahead and dive on, though television replays suggested that Offiah had managed to release the ball before he went into touch. After a high shot from Andy Farrell on Mark Carroll, Johns kicked another penalty giving Australia a 10–4 lead at the thirty-minute mark. Just before the half-time break England conceded another penalty in the ruck but Johns' kick missed so the score remained unchanged at the break.\n2nd half.\nAfter making their way into good attacking field position, England played the ball ten metres out from Australia's goal-line where centre Paul Newlove at dummy-half ran the ball at the defence of Terry Hill and Brett Dallas to force his way through to score in the left corner. The sideline conversion attempt by Goulding missed so England trailed 8–10 after five minutes of the second half. Around the ten-minute mark the game was interrupted by a topless female streaker. The play continued swinging from one end of the field to the other, with neither team able to capitalise on their scoring opportunities for the next twenty minutes. Australian interchange player Jason Smith was blood binned and had to return to the bench. A few minutes later the Kangaroos had made their way deep into England's half when, on the last tackle, the ball was moved through the hands and eventually flicked passed back from Johns as he was being tackled to the feet of Brasher who kicked it ahead to the try-line. Both fullbacks then scrambled to get to the ball and the referee ruled that Brasher had grounded it, awarding Australia a try. Johns converted the try so Australia lead 16–8 with just over ten minutes remaining. England forward Karl Harrison then had to come off the field with an injured arm. A few minutes from full-time Australian forward Mark Carroll was sent to the sin-bin for an infringement in the ruck. The remainder of the match extended into additional injury time but was played with no further points so Australia retained the World Cup with a 16–8 victory and their fifth consecutive world title.\n21-year-old Andrew Johns was named man-of-the-match. Kangaroos coach Bob Fulton had named the young half as the team hooker, and he did indeed pack into the scrums. However Johns played at halfback in general play with Geoff Toovey having the dummy-half duties, necessary because Toovey had actually injured his neck during the tournament and simply could not pack into the front row in the scrums.\nFollowing the match Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex presented Kangaroos captain Brad Fittler with the Cup and each of the players with medals. During the 1990 Kangaroo Tour, an 18-year-old Fittler had reportedly broken protocol when he had said \"G'day dude\" to Prince Edward's father, HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh when the team had met the Duke as part of the tour. History allegedly repeated itself as Fittler was heard to say \"Thanks dude\" to Prince Edward when receiving the World Cup on the Wembley balcony."

        "text": "Alexander Edward Brown (27 May 1908 – 3 September 1995) was one of the leading professional snooker players from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s. Brown was a former speedway driver.\nHe was born in London, the son of Alexander Brown, a professional billiards player. Alec Brown became a professional player aged 14.\nThe official rules of both snooker and billiards state that \"A cue shall be not less than 3 ft (914 mm) in length and shall show no change from the traditional tapered shape and form, with a tip, used to strike the cue-ball, secured to the thinner end.\" This rule was introduced following an incident on 14 November 1938 when Brown was playing Tom Newman at Thurston's Hall in the 1938/1939 Daily Mail Gold Cup. In the third frame, Brown potted a red, after which the cue ball was left amidst several reds, with only a narrow way through to the black, the only colour not , and which was near its spot. Playing this with conventional equipment would have been awkward. To the surprise of spectators, Brown produced a small fountain pen-sized cue from his vest pocket, chalked it, and played the stroke. Newman protested at this.\nThe referee, Charles Chambers, then inspected the implement, a strip of ebony about five inches long, with one end having a cue tip. Chambers decided to award a foul, and awarded Newman seven points. In response to questions, the referee quoted the rule that said all strokes must be made with the tip of the cue, so he did not regard the \"fountain-pen cue\" as a valid cue. Eight days later, the Billiards Association and Control Council, which owned the rules, met and decided to introduce a new rule, which has been developed into today's version: \"A billiards cue, as recognised by the Billiards and Control Council, shall not be less than three feet in length, and shall show no substantial departure from the traditional and generally accepted shape and form."

Denmark, which had participated in every prior edition, did not send a team, while Scotland was making both its tournament debut and its ODI debut. England, the winner of the past five editions of the tournament, selected only players under the age of 19 in its squad, although all the team's matches were granted official status. Ireland won all of its round-robin matches to claim its first title. As at the previous tournament in 1999, no final was played, although both England and Ireland were undefeated going into their final match, making that a \"de facto\" final.

He served as president of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues from 1991 through 2007.\nEarly life and career.\nMoore was born and raised in Columbus, Indiana. He enrolled at the University of Tampa in 1960 and played college baseball for the Tampa Spartans as a catcher. After suffering a shoulder injury, he called Spartans baseball games on the college radio station and managed the station. Moore earned a degree in business education in 1963.\nAfter Moore graduated, he became the University of Tampa's sports information director. He hosted a country music radio show on WYOU, was a sports reporter for WTVT, and a ring announcer for Championship Wrestling from Florida.\nFrom 1971 to 1988, he served as vice president, general manager and part owner of the Tampa Tarpons, a Florida State League affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds organization. During the 1970s, Tampa was in the farm system of the Cincinnati Reds, and he worked with their general manager, Bob Howsam, who put together the Big Red Machine.\nNational Association of Professional Baseball Leagues.\nIn 1988 Moore worked as chief administrative officer for the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL), working with president Sal Artiaga. Moore was elected the 10th president of the NAPBL in December 1991. One of his most important moves came in 1992, when he was to convene a constitutional convention that would rewrite the National Association Agreement, which controlled the relationship between the NAPBL and its member leagues. The aforementioned agreement had not materially changed since the organization was founded in 1901.\nAnother important change was converting the NAPBL to more of a \"corporate\" structure than a \"political\" one, which prompted an intensively grown organization under his leadership. Back to 1991, prior to becoming President, Moore established an agency agreement partnership between the Professional Baseball Promotion Corporation, a NAPBL subsidiary, and Major League Baseball Properties to authorize licensed merchandise.\nMoore was elected to four terms as president, winning re-election three times without opposition. As attendance increased steadily over the years, Minor League Baseball set a new all-time attendance record of 42.8 million fans in 2007, the last season for Moore after spending 16 years in the office.\nIn 2009, Moore became an inaugural inductee in the Florida State League Hall of Fame.\nPersonal life.\nMoore and his wife, Barbara, had five children and nine grandchildren. \nDeath.\nMoore died at Oak Hill Hospital in Brooksville, Florida, after a long illness on February 3, 2022, at the age of 80."

On Twitter, Jackson exchanged comments with Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden after he critiqued an email of hers which insinuated that the United States of America should take Libya's oil to help mitigate the U.S. deficit. Jackson has also criticized Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and many other progressive Democrats in Congress for refusing to withhold their votes for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House of Representatives until Pelosi agreed to bring Medicare for All to a floor vote. In February 2021, Jackson started \"The Takeover with Justin Jackson\", a progressive commentary show on YouTube. Jackson is good friends with fellow activist and commentator Kyle Kulinski who in Jackson's own words has influenced him, and has assisted in his political journey."

        "title": "Duff House Royal Golf Club",
        "text": "Duff House Royal Golf Club is a Championship Course and one of the best golf courses in Aberdeenshire. Located in Banff, Scotland it was founded in 1910 and is designed by Dr Alister MacKenzie. It was founded as the Duff House Golf Club and became the Duff House Royal Golf Club after subsequently receiving royal patronage, at the request of Princess Louise, Dowager Duchess of Fife, in 1925.\nThere are 66 golf clubs around the world that have adopted the royal title from the British Royal Family. The first golf club to be conferred the title was the Royal Perth Golfing Society in 1833, followed by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1834. Duff House Royal Golf Club – the only royal golf club where the royal title is used as a suffix and not a prefix. It is believed the reason for the royal title being a suffix to Duff House was a tribute to Louise, who was known as the Princess Royal, not the Royal Princess.\nIn 2014, the club featured in a book commissioned by the R&amp;A to mark Her Majesty The Queen's Diamond Jubilee - Golf's Royal Clubs Honoured by The British Royal Family 1833-2013 by Scott Macpherson\nThe Course.\nThe course has a scratch of 68. The course is flat and is close to the sea, it has little rough which makes the course a fair challenge to golfers. The course record is currently held by David Morrison (DHR) who completed the course in an 8-Under Par 60, whilst competing in August 2006.\nDuff House Royal Golf Club was designed in 1923, by the legendary Dr. Alister MacKenzie, who also designed the world-famous 'Augusta National', home of The Masters. Duff House Royal still, till this day, have the large MacKenzie two-tiered greens.\nThe course is bounded by the River Deveron, which proves to be a hazard at a number of holes. The river flows into the sea through the seven-span Banff Bridge, which was completed in 1779 by John Smeaton, and forms the backdrop to the closing holes.\nNestling in the middle of the course is Duff House, considered one of the grandest classical country houses built in the 18th century and designed by William Adam It is managed by Historic Scotland and contains fine paintings and furniture on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland.\nCourse details.\nMen Course Rating | White - 69.4/115 | Yellow - 68.7/113 | Red - 66.8/109 |\nCourse History.\nAlthough golf is supposed to have been played in Banff for 400 years, it was only in May 1871 that organised golf was conceived when the then Banff Golf Club was formed at the Banff links. The Banff Golf Club continued in existence with varying degrees of success until 1924.\nThe Duff House Golf Club came into existence following a gift of land to the towns of Banff and Macduff by the then Duke of Fife following his concern at \"the want of ground for golf and other recreational sports.\" The original course in its present location was laid out in 1909.\nOpened in 1909, the original course was designed by Archie Simpson (who laid out Royal Aberdeen's Balgownie) and it was formally opened when a match was played between two of the great golfing \"triumvirate\" – J.H. Taylor (the then Open Champion) and James Braid – with Taylor's score of 75 beating his opponent by three strokes.\nIn July, 1923 at the invitation of the executive of the Duff House Royal Golf Club, Dr MacKenzie, Golf course architect, Leeds, visited Banff and made a thorough examination and survey of the then 18-hole course in connection with the proposal to lay out a first class course. After his inspection Dr MacKenzie spoke favourably of the site. An inclusive figure of £2900 was muted to lay out a first class course.\nThe work was sanctioned and work would start in December, 1923 with a Government unemployment grant of £1200. Maj McKenzie, Leeds, the managing director of the British Golf Course Construction Coy would use horse-drawn scoops for bunkers and all eighteen greens where to be lifted, weeded and relayed on suitable foundations.\nOn 5 August 1924 the Mackenzie course was formally opened with a match between Sandy Herd of Moor Park and Ted Ray of Oxley, both returning scores of 71\nOn 1 January 1925, the two Banff golf clubs formally amalgamated as the Duff House Royal Golf Club. The union of the two Clubs survived, with tolerance and restraint being exercised on both sides, but it was only a matter of time before the axe would fall on the Links Course. The end came at the Annual General Meeting held on Thursday, 24 January 1929 when A.F. Spence, seconded by G.F. Goodall, formally moved that the maintenance of the Links Club be now discontinued. While expressing regret that such a motion should be necessary, Mr. Spence pointed out the annual financial loss to the club, the changed circumstances at the Links which \"are now over-run in the summer by picnic parties and motor vehicles; also to the few members of the Club who play there and small support received from other players in the town and from visitors, also that this was an opportune time to give up the leased portion of the course in view of the cropping rotation of the Landlord's farm\"\nIn 1949 the course was restored and re-opened following the \"ploughing up\" required during the Second World War and in 1962 an additional 35 acres were purchased at a cost of £3,000.\nThe original clubhouse was built in 1926 following a gift from Thomas Barton, and was known as the \"Barton Pavilion\" and remained largely unaltered until 1962. In that year it was reconstructed around the shell of the original Barton Pavilion and formally opened by Sir George W. Abercromby on 6 April 1963.\nIn 1966 a \"Water to the Greens\" scheme was completed and in 1997 a fully automated watering system for greens and tees was installed. In 1973 it was modernised and W.H.K. Baker (M.P) formally opened the modernised Clubhouse on 18 June 1971. In 1973 the purchase of 65 acres including the stables and Barnyards outbuildings was completed. Further extensive works including extensions were carried out in 1974 - 75 and the Clubhouse was the subject of a major refurbishment, mainly to the interior decor in 1988, with extensive refurbishment of the kitchen area following in 1996–97.\nAt the Annual General Meeting in December 2000 the membership authorised the Committee of the club to proceed with extensive redevelopment of the Clubhouse at an estimated cost of £400,000.\nIn November 2009, the course suffered server flooding.\nIn 2010 the club celebrated its centenary year. To commemorate this occasion, a number of centenary activities were arranged, mainly condensed into a ‘Week of Celebration’ running from Saturday 26 June to Saturday 3 July 2010\nRoyal Heritage.\nAlexander Duff (1849-1912) the 6th Earl was the last Duff to live, with his family, at Duff House. The 6th Earl of Fife, Alexander, was the Founder and Patron of the Golf Club. Aged 40, he astonished his close friend, Edward, Prince of Wales, by seeking to marry his eldest daughter, Louise, who was then just 22. Queen Victoria was delighted and the Earl was granted a Dukedom as befitted his marriage to a Royal Princess. The Earl was given a choice of titles but finally settled for the ancestral Fife. The marriage took place at Buckingham Palace on Saturday, 27 July 1889 \nTheir enthusiasm for the Royal and Ancient game was boundless so much so that they employed a professional for the maintenance of the few holes which surrounded Duff House.\nThe couple gifted Duff house and 140 acres to the communities of Banff and Macduff in 1906, which in turn led to the development of the course and the ultimate ownership of the land by Duff House Royal Golf Club.\nIn December 1923 The Princess Louise expressed a wish to become Patroness of the club and desired that the Club become Duff House Royal Golf Club"

        "text": "Gerald Williams (24 June 1929 – 21 January 2016) was a British tennis commentator and journalist. Williams wrote for the \"Croydon Advertiser\" and the \"Daily Mail\". Williams was a studio guest on the nightly round-up of Wimbledon coverage on BBC television from 1981 to 1989 (from 1983 to 1989 with Des Lynam).\nBiography.\nWilliams was born in Surrey and spent his teenage years in Llangynog in Carmarthenshire and Croydon in south London. Williams studied at Carmarthen Grammar School and joined the \"Croydon Advertiser\" after school, becoming the sports editor of the newspaper after a few years. Williams subsequently worked for the \"Daily Mail\" as a sub-editor having been recommended by his friend, the boxing commentator Harry Carpenter. Williams was appointed by the \"Daily Mail\" as its Manchester football correspondent after his predecessor, Eric Thompson, was killed in the Munich air disaster in 1958. In a 2011 interview, Williams said: \"It was a strange feeling for a young man from London to be sitting in the press box at Old Trafford with the new Busby Babes. ...Half the football team had been wiped out but there was almost a spirituality about it.\"\nITV recruited Williams as a tennis commentator in the 1960s, a sport in which his interest was both professional and personal. Williams worked in tandem with Fred Perry as the network’s main voices. Football commentary was also part of the remit. From 1971, Williams worked on the \"Southern Soccer\" programme for Southern Television, and hosted and commentated on \"Soccer Special\" for HTV.\nWilliams was asked to become a radio tennis commentator by BBC executive Cliff Morgan, beginning regular broadcasts in 1974. Williams had learned how to project his voice through his experience of amateur dramatics, his fellow commentator Dan Maskell later told him of television commentators that \"A lot of the time they tell you what you have just seen...And that is the worst thing you can do.\" Jim White later wrote in a 2016 tribute article for the \"Daily Telegraph\" that \"Williams's ability to trust the audience to appreciate what was going on was one of his abiding strengths.\" Williams said of Maskell that he remembered \"...doing a match on Centre Court in Wimbledon for the first time with Dan. I was in awe of him. He was such a lovely man. There's never been anyone like him. He became my best friend.\"\nWilliams was particularly associated with Des Lynam. After both Lynam and Williams worked for BBC Radio covering Wimbledon in the late 1970s, both joined Wimbledon's television coverage in the early 1980s. After initially appearing as a studio guest in the nightly highlights programme at Wimbledon with David Vine in 1981 and 1982, Williams appeared with Lynam from 1983 to 1989. Jim White described Williams and Lynam as making \"an odd couple. Alongside Lynam's smooth, telegenic ease, Williams, with his unfashionable haircut and huge glasses, looked like a chemistry teacher who had taken a wrong turn on his way to the school lab.\" Williams left the BBC at the end of 1989 and worked as the lead tennis commentator for BSB in 1990 (BSB merged with Sky in November 1990) and Sky Sports from 1991 to 2001. Williams introduced the singer Cliff Richard to tennis player Sue Barker; Richard later considered marriage to Barker.\nWilliams was sympathetic to the tempestuous on-court behaviour of male tennis players in the 1980s including Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, and Ilie Năstase, later saying in an interview: \"Sometimes I'd be doing the commentary and criticising the players for their behaviour and I felt like a complete sham.\" Williams was also admonished by McEnroe himself, who told the umpire at the 1978 Davis Cup Final between the USA and Great Britain to \"tell that Brit commentator to keep his voice down.\"\nWilliams spent his retirement in Bancyfelin, near Carmarthen in West Wales."

        "text": "The Asturian bowling is the variation of bowling mainly played in Asturias, and the most important traditional sport in this Spanish Autonomous Community.\nHistory.\nThere are controversies about its origins. The most credible hypothesis talks about how pilgrims brought this tradition thanks to the Camino de Santiago.\nBowling is important in Asturian culture as it is mentioned in the Regional mythology, for example with the golden bowls of the xanes.\nThe first reference of Asturian bowling, one of the oldest in Spain, dates back to 1495. Alonso de Quintanilla, major book-keeper of the Catholic Monarchs, complains Nuno Bernaldo de Quirós of ruining the coat of arms during a bowling game at \"Campo de San Francisco\" in Oviedo. Thanks to this document, it is known that the pins were called \"byrlos\" and that betting was usual during the games.\nIn the 18th century, according to Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, \"in most villages and places of Asturias there's a bowling alley, a place where neighbors meet and play.\" During the 19th century and the early 20th, the Asturian bowling became the most widespread activity in the rural zones of the Region.\nAsturian bowling popularity grows during the 20th century with the creation of a Federation, that was dissolved during the Spanish Civil War. When it finished, competitions were reorganized and the Asturian Federation of Bowling was reestablished in 1962.\nNowadays, due to the rural emigration, some bowling variations fell into disuse. Despite the emigration, the rise of interest in traditional culture is helping to keep the game, specially in the most played variations like \"cuatreada\", \"birle\" or \"bolo celta\"."

        "text": "The 2016 NCAA Division I baseball tournament began on Friday, June 3, 2016, as part of the 2016 NCAA Division I baseball season. The 64-team, double-elimination tournament concluded with the 2016 College World Series (CWS) in Omaha, Nebraska, starting on June 18, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2016. The 64 participating NCAA Division I college baseball teams were selected out of 298 eligible teams. Thirty-one teams were awarded an automatic bid, as champions of their conferences; the remaining 33 teams were selected at-large by the NCAA Division I Baseball Committee.\nTeams were divided into sixteen regionals of four teams, which conducted a double-elimination tournament. Regional champions faced each other in Super Regionals, a best-of-three-game series to determine the eight participants of the College World Series. The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) set a conference record and tied the all-time mark of having ten teams in the championship field. A tournament-high seven regional hosts came from the Southeastern Conference (SEC), followed by six of the ten ACC schools; however, only Miami (ACC) and Florida (SEC) advanced to Omaha, and they were the first and second teams eliminated, respectively. For the first time since the tournament expanded from 48 teams in 1999, the NCAA did not select any Pac-12 schools to host a regional, and Lubbock, Texas, (Texas Tech) was the westernmost regional host city picked by the selection committee.\nIn the CWS after Texas Tech lost to Big 12 rival TCU, none of the three national seeds who had reached Omaha had won their opening game. Tech eventually became the fourth team to be eliminated. While Oklahoma State and TCU advanced through the winners' bracket to set up a possible all–Big 12 championship, Arizona and Coastal Carolina won both elimination games to advance to the best-of-three final series.\nWith each team winning a game in the championship series to force a winner-take-all Game 3, the tournament reached the maximum of 17 games for the first time; the finals expanded in 2003 to a best-of-three format as opposed to a single, winner-take-all championship game. Coastal Carolina won the deciding game, 4–3, becoming the first team since 1956 to win the title in its first CWS appearance. Coastal Carolina won six elimination games in NCAA post-season play – one in a Regional, three in the CWS double-elimination bracket, and two in the Championship Series. The runner-up, Arizona, won six elimination games – three in a Regional and three in the CWS double-elimination bracket, but lost their 7th, the last game of the Championship Series.\nNational seeds.\nThe following eight teams automatically host a Super Regional if they advance to that round:\nBold indicates College World Series participant&lt;br&gt;\n† indicates teams that were eliminated in the Regional Tournament&lt;br&gt;\n‡ indicates teams that were eliminated in the Super Regional Tournament\nRegionals and Super Regionals.\n\"Bold indicates winner.

It was streamed at westwoodonesports.com and on TuneIn. Kevin Kugler and John Bishop called all games leading up to the Championship Series with Gary Sharp acting as the field reporter. The Championship Series was called by Kugler (Gms 1–2), Bishop (Gm 3), and Scott Graham. Ted Emrich acted as field reporter for Games 1 &amp; 2.\nTelevision.\nESPN carried every game from the Regionals, Super Regionals, and College World Series across its networks. During the Regionals, ESPN offered a dedicated channel, ESPN Bases Loaded (carried in the same channel allotments as its \"Goal Line\" and \"Buzzer Beater\" services for football and basketball), which carried live look-ins and analysis across all games in progress, hosted by Brendan Fitzgerald and Matt Schick with Kyle Peterson providing analysis.\nThe final game of the tournament aired on ESPNU, as the NCAA scheduled the game for an afternoon start, and there were scheduling conflicts with ESPN and ESPN2 due to UEFA Euro 2016 and the 2016 Wimbledon Championships.\nBroadcast assignments.\n\"Regionals\"\n\"Super Regionals\"\n\"College World Series\"\n\"Regionals\"\n\"Super Regionals\"\n\"College World Series Championship Series\""

Former Queensland representative and Queensland Origin coach Kevin Walters was named as inaugural coach of the Queensland under-20 team.\nFrom 2012 to 2014, the under-20 Origin fixture was held in April, on the Representative Weekend. In 2015, the game was moved to July as a curtain-raiser to State of Origin.\nIn April 2017, Queensland legend Justin Hodges was named as head coach of the side.\nIn 2018, they recorded their first win in the fixture, defeating New South Wales 30–12 at Suncorp Stadium. On 16 November 2018, assistant coach and former Queensland representative Scott Prince took over as co-head coach, alongside former Brisbane Broncos women's head coach Paul Dyer, after Hodges was elevated to assistant coach of the senior Queensland side.\nPlayers.\nPlayers selected for the Queensland under-20 team are under contract with a National Rugby League (NRL) side and play in either the NRL, Intrust Super Cup, Canterbury Cup NSW, Hastings Deering Colts or Jersey Flegg Cup competitions.

The original Bond University club was based on the same field as the current one, but relations with the university were never good, and a permanent club house and change rooms were never made available. The Pirates were a loosely affiliated bunch of rugby enthusiasts with no fixed home ground who would often cobble together a team on a Saturday morning. Eventually, the two clubs, realising that something had to change in order for each to survive, agreed to combine. Initially the newly formed club remained at Bond University, but with tensions increasing over vehicle access, noise, ground and facility maintenance, and a raft of other issues, the decision was made to look for a new home. Eventually a deal was struck with the Gold Coast City Council to take over a recently vacated club house at the back of the Miami tip, in the Pizzey Park sports complex. That ground remains the home of the Bond Pirates to this day. In the years since the amalgamation, the club has played in, and lost, three first grade grand finals. 1998, 2004 and 2015. So despite winning several junior, colts and lower grade premierships, the elusive first grade flag has yet to be captured by the club. Quite a number of junior players have gone on to play Colts at the Bond University Club, which competes in the Queensland Premier League based in Brisbane.\nNotable former players.\nSam Kaletta\nJohn Clarke\nBen Daley\nSam Norton-Knight"

When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest T20I partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the Afghan pairing of Hazratullah Zazai and Usman Ghani who put together an opening wicket partnership of 236 runs during the Ireland v Afghanistan series in India in 2019\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nAhsan Raza of Pakistan holds the record for the most T20I matches umpired with 49. The most experienced New Zealand umpire is Chris Brown with 27 matches officiated so far."

        "text": "Arthur Tudor Young (14 October 1901 – 26 February 1933) was an English rugby union scrum-half who played for both England and the British Lions. At 5 ft 4ins he was affectionately known as England's \"little man\".\nPersonal history.\nYoung was born in Darjeeling, India in 1901. As a child he moved to Britain and was educated at Tonbridge School before matriculating to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. On leaving education he joined the British Army, serving in the Royal Tank Corps. Later in his career he was Aide-de-camp to Sir Norman MacMullen while he was General Officer Commanding Eastern Command in India. While serving in India he contracted influenza and died in 1933 from pneumonia at the age of 31.\nRugby career.\nYoung began playing rugby as a youth, turning out for Tunbridge School. On entering Cambridge he joined Cambridge University R.U.F.C. earning three sporting Blues when he faced Oxford in three Varsity matches between 1922-24. After leaving university he joined Blackheath F.C. and also represented Kent at county level. In 1924 he was selected for the England national team, facing Wales in the Five Nations Championship. Young went on to represent England on 18 occasions, scoring two tries. 1924 also saw Young selected for the British Lions on their 1924 British Lions tour to South Africa. He played in nine games of the tour and faced South Africa in the second Test in Johannesburg, which the Lions lost 17-0.\nDuring his time in the British Army, Young represented the Army rugby team ten times between 1926 and 1929. Young was also a long-serving member of invitational touring side Barbarian F.C., first playing with the club in 1920, long before his international career started. He represented the Barbarians 12 times, his final match being against East Midlands in 1929."

        "title": "2016 Vuelta a España",
        "text": "The 2016 Vuelta a España was a three-week Grand Tour cycling stage race that took place in Spain between 20 August and 11 September 2016. The race was the 71st edition of the Vuelta a España and the final Grand Tour of the 2016 cycling season.\nThe race included 21 stages, beginning with a team time trial that started in Ourense. The subsequent stages included 10 summit finishes. The race ended in Madrid.\nThe overall winner was Nairo Quintana of team Movistar, with Chris Froome (Team Sky) second and Esteban Chaves (Orica–BikeExchange) third.\nTeams.\nThe eighteen UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to attend the race. The organiser of the Vuelta, Unipublic, was also able to invite four UCI Professional Continental teams – the second tier of professional cycling teams – as wildcards.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute.\nThe route of the 2016 Vuelta was announced on 9 January 2016. In contrast to the two previous editions of the Vuelta, which had begun in Andalusia, this edition spent its first week in Galicia in the north-west of Spain. The first stage was a team time trial to Castrelo de Miño. The first significant climb of the race was at the end of the third stage, which was the first of ten summit finishes in the race. The route travelled through Asturias before coming to the Basque Country; the fourteenth stage, described by \"Cyclingnews.com\" as the hardest of the race, took place mainly just across the border in France. The route continued down the eastern coast of Spain over the next few days, with several mountainous stages, with the race's only individual time trial coming on stage 19. One more mountainous stage followed, finishing on the Alto de Aitana, before the riders travelled to Madrid for the closing stage on a circuit in the city centre.\nClassification leadership.\nThe race included four principal classifications. The first of these was the general classification, which was calculated by adding up each rider's times on each stage and applying the relevant time bonuses. These were 10 seconds for the stage winner, 6 seconds for the rider in second, and 4 seconds for the rider in third, and 3, 2 and 1 seconds for the first three riders at each intermediate sprint; no bonuses were awarded on the time trial stages. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Vuelta. The rider leading the classification wore a red jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders were awarded points for finishing in the top fifteen places on each stage and in the top three at each intermediate sprint. The first rider at each stage finish was awarded 25 points, the second 20 points, the third 16 points, the fourth 14 points, the fifth 12 points, the sixth 10 points, down to 1 point for the rider in fifteenth. At the intermediate sprints, the first three riders won 4, 2 and 1 points respectively. The rider with the most points won the classification and wore a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs. Stages were categorised as third-, second-, first- and special-category, with the more difficult climbs rated higher. The most difficult climb of the race was given its own category as the Cima Alberto Fernández. Points were awarded for the first riders across the summit of each climb; the rider with the most accumulated points won the classification and wore a white jersey with blue polka dots.\nThe fourth individual classification was the combination classification. This was calculated by adding up each rider's position on the other three individual classifications. The rider with the lowest cumulative score was the winner of the classification and wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated by adding together the times of each team's best three riders on each stage. The team with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the classification. There was also a combativeness prize awarded on each stage; three riders were chosen on each stage by a race jury to recognise the rider \"who displayed the most courageous effort\". There was then a public vote to decide which rider would be awarded the prize; the rider wore a red \"dossard\" (race number) the following day. An identical procedure took place on the final stage to decide the most combative rider of the whole Vuelta.\nControversy.\nIn stage 15, more than 90 riders were 10 km/h slower than the winner and finished far outside of the time cut. They were, nevertheless, allowed to stay in the race. Of the six remaining stages, five were won by riders from that grupetto (Drucker, Frank, 2x Cort Nielsen, Latour), Froome being the only exception after winning the time trial (stage 19)."

        "text": "Willie James Burton Jr. (born 24 June 1962) is an American-New Zealand former professional basketball player who spent 19 seasons playing in the New Zealand National Basketball League (NBL). Burton came to New Zealand in the mid-1980s to play for Palmerston North and became a league legend. He kept himself in great shape and was still playing top basketball when he turned 40. He won six rebounding titles and ranks as the league's all-time leader around the boards. He finished his career with 4,244 career rebounds, nearly 1,500 rebounds more than the next best individual rebounding total.\nEarly life and career.\nBurton grew up playing baseball in his hometown of Millen, Georgia. Lanky, flexible and possessing lightning reflexes, Burton stood head and shoulders above others as a \"cornerman\" for his team at the age of 12. His father, Willie James Sr., was a keen baseball player, but Burton was not so much. Luckily for Burton, a friend, Alonzo Holmes, lived down the road in his neighbourhood and introduced him to basketball. He went on to play four years of college basketball for the University of Tennessee between 1980 and 1984. He appeared in 111 games for the Volunteers over his career, and averaged a team-high 13.5 points per game as a senior in 1983–84. He also led the team in rebounds per game as a junior and senior (8.1 and 7.3 per game respectively), and blocks per game as a sophomore and junior (1.3 and 0.8 per game respectively).\nFollowing his senior season with Tennessee, Burton was selected in the sixth round of the 1984 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. He subsequently attended training camp with the Nuggets, but he did not make the final roster cut.\nNBL career.\nIn 1985, Burton moved to New Zealand and joined the Palmerston North Jets of the National Basketball League (NBL). In his first season, he averaged 28.6 points and a league-high 16.1 rebounds per game. He continued on with the Jets in 1986 before joining the Hawke's Bay Hawks in 1987. After two seasons with the Hawks, he returned to Palmerston North, playing for them in 1989 and 1990. In 1991, he joined New Plymouth and played three seasons for the team before returning to Hawke's Bay in 1994 where he spent the next four years. After playing in the second division competition for the North Otago Penguins in 1998, he returned to Palmerston North for a third stint in 1999, but again re-joined the Hawks just two seasons later. Burton retired following the 2002 season, but came out of retirement in 2005 to help the Hawks reach the grand final, where they were defeated by the Auckland Stars by one point. He played one final season in 2006, this time winning his first and only championship with an 85–69 win in the grand final over Auckland. He retired for a second time following the 2006 season, departing the NBL after 19 seasons.\nBurton finished his NBL career as an eight-time All-Star Five honouree and a six-time rebounding champion. He was also named Most Outstanding Forward in 1989, and after gaining New Zealand citizenship in the mid-90s, he was named Most Outstanding Kiwi Forward/Centre in 1997. As evidence of his all-round game, he also won the league assist title in 1999 with 5.6 assists per game. His 4,244 career rebounds ranks first on the league's all-time rebounding list.\nAfter retiring from playing, Burton continued on as an assistant coach with the Hawks, while also coaching the Hawke's Bay under 15, 17 and 19 men's teams.\nNational team career.\nBurton's all-round game made him an ideal substitute off the bench for Tall Black captain Pero Cameron when he was selected to play for New Zealand at the 2001 Goodwill Games at the age of 39. He then played a crucial part in the historic series victory over Australia later that year. Burton was still in the selection mix for the 2002 FIBA World Championship, but was replaced by Ed Book as the team's one allowable naturalised player following the team's series against Hungary.\nPersonal.\nBurton and his wife Suzanne, a New Zealander, have two sons, Alonzo and Dominique. Alonzo followed in his father's footsteps and joined the Hawke's Bay Hawks in 2012."

It has rosters in \"League of Legends\", \"Overwatch\", \"Rocket League\", \"Valorant\", \"Counter-Strike 2\" and a number of streamers on the internet platform Twitch.\nHistory.\nOwned by SSG LJ, The team was founded by Sacramento Kings co-owners Mark Mastrov and Andy Miller in November 2015.\nIn March 2016 NRG announced that Alex Rodriguez, Shaquille O'Neal and Jimmy Rollins were joining as investors.\nOn April 20, 2018, Tiesto was announced as an investor.\nIn August 2017, the Canadian esports company Northern Gaming was acquired by NRG. Northern Gaming's co-owners were rolled into NRG, making twitch streamer Sodapoppin a named advisor and co-owner.\nIn September 2019, it was announced that Hector \"H3CZ\" Rodriguez had joined as co-CEO, after another announcement the same day that Hector and the Immortals Gaming Club had parted ways.\nOn August 24, 2020, \"Tubefilter\" announced that NRG partnered with Shots Studios, a Los Angeles-based production and management company, for content production, social strategy, and merchandising.\nOn 6 April 2023, NRG acquired Counter Logic Gaming and its League Championship Series (LCS) slot, returning to the league for the first time since 2016.\nOn 15 September 2023, NRG announced the dissolution of their Apex Legends team, citing lack of support from EA for competitive Apex as the reason. \nCurrent divisions.\n\"Apex Legends\".\nOn February 11, 2019, NRG became one of the first organizations to sign a professional \"Apex Legends\" player with the signing of Coby \"Dizzy\" Meadows. The team signed Brandon \"Aceu\" Winn and Marshall \"Mohr\" Mohr in March and May, respectively, to round out its three-player squad. Dizzy competed in the first-ever Apex Legends Pro-Am, securing 1st place, the tournament's MVP award, and a $23,000 charitable donation to the V Foundation. Following the retirement of Dizzy in December 2019, the team picked up their new talent Joseph \"Frexs\" Sanchez in the beginning of January, about a month later. In July 23, 2022, after the ALGS 2022: Championship, Aidan \"rocker\" Grodin announced his departure from the team. On August 13, the team signed Dennis \"Gilderson\" Zachary as their third teammate. On September 15, 2023 NRG announced their departure from Apex Legends.\n\"League of Legends\".\nNRG took over the League Championship Series slot and roster owned by Counter Logic Gaming in April 2023. The team won the 2023 LCS Summer Finals after defeating Cloud9 in the finals by a score of 3–1. At the 2023 League of Legends World Championship NRG qualified for the knockout stage after defeating the top seeded European team G2 Esports 2-0.\n\"Overwatch\".\nOn August 3, NRG signed the members of the former \"Overwatch\" team Luminosity Gaming. NRG owns the Overwatch League team San Francisco Shock. NRG owned an Overwatch Contenders team competing as the Shock's academy team up until May 8, 2019, when they withdrew their participation in the tournament.\n\"Rocket League\".\nNRG Esports signed the \"Kings of Urban\" roster after a strong finish in their region in the RLCS (Rocket League Championship Series) Season 1 in 2016. RLCS Season 2 saw NRG bow out of the RLCS finals after a loss to Flipsid3 Tactics which resulted in NRG finishing 5-6th. In the off-season, GarrettG was picked up from his former team \"Orbit\", replacing Sadjunior. This new roster achieved a 3rd-place finish in the RLCS Season 3 finals, losing out to the eventual champions in \"Northern Gaming\". \nAfter a disappointing last-place finish in the RLCS Season 4 Finals, NRG dropped mainstay and fan-favorite Jacob for rookie prodigy jstn. With jstn, NRG came one goal away from becoming the Rocket League world champions in Season 5. After going undefeated in both regular season and the first two days of the RLCS tournament, NRG met Dignitas in the Grand Finals. Dignitas reset the bracket with a 4–1 win in the first best-of-seven, which meant one final series would crown the champs. In Game 7, NRG trailed by one goal in the final moments, but jstn scored a last-second goal to send the game into overtime, where they ultimately lost.\nNRG would continue to dominate RLCS regional play in seasons 6 and 7, only to fall short of expectations at both finals. Several days after the end of Season 7, NRG legend Fireburner announced he was stepping away from competitive Rocket League. Nearly a month later, it was announced that three-time RLCS champion Turbopolsa, a member of the same Dignitas team that defeated NRG for the world title in season 5, would replace Fireburner, becoming the first player to make a cross-region move from Europe to North America. Months after Turbopolsa's move to North America, NRG Esports would finally go on to win the Rocket League World Championship series on December 15, 2019, beating Renault Vitality in a seven-game Grand Finals with jstn scoring the winning goal in overtime. They would then drop Turbopolsa in order to sign SquishyMuffinz, a player coming from the recently disbanded team Cloud9. With this roster, they went on to win RLCS X North American Championship, and lose in the Grand Finals of Fall Major RLCS 11 to Team BDS. \nNRG qualified for the Winter Major as the number 1 seed from NA, they went 1-2 in groups and were placed in the lower bracket against the eventual runner ups Team Queso, which they lost. NRG failed to qualify for the Spring Major, this was the first time NRG failed to qualify for an RLCS international LAN,but they qualified for the RLCS 2021-2022 Finals wildcard in Fort Worth. Although they failed to qualify for the Spring Major they still had enough points to qualify for the Main Event in Fort Worth. Following Version 1's loss against Moist Esports, NRG qualified for the Main Event in Fort Worth as the 3rd seed from North America.\n\"Valorant\".\nOn October 8, 2020, NRG entered the Valorant scene, officially signing Damian \"Daps\" Steele, Sam \"s0m\" Oh, and coach Chet Singh. NRG never found huge success within the Valorant scene, although consistently remaining as one of the top teams in North America. After being accepted into Riot Games' partnered leagues for 2023, NRG let go of their entire roster, deciding to build with only Sam \"s0m\" Oh from the old roster. Following the announcement, NRG signed the OpTic Gaming core of in-game leader Pujan \"FNS\" Mehta, Austin \"crashies\" Roberts, Victor \"Victor\" Wong, and Chet again as head coach, with the addition of Ardis \"ardiis\" Svarenieks, who previously had a highly successful 2022 run with FunPlus Phoenix. They later signed Zander \"thwifo\" Kim as sixth man in December 2022, but parted ways in March 2023. Later that month, NRG signed one of their content creators, Alan “ethos” Ruan, as their new sixth man. NRG placed second in the Americas League and would qualify to 2023 Masters Tokyo, in which they placed fourth, and 2023 Valorant Champions, in which the team could not qualify to playoffs and were eliminated early.\nOn September 14, 2023, s0m announced his departure after his nearly three-year stint with NRG, opting to pursue streaming in the meantime. On September 19, 2023, FNS announced his departure, believing he was no longer a \"correct fit\" for the roster and likewise pursuing streaming. On October 11, 2023, ardiis was signed to Natus Vincere, reuniting with his teammates from 2022. On December 23, 2023, NRG announced the signing of 2023 Valorant Champions winners Max “Demon1” Mazanov and Ethan “Ethan” Arnold, as well as Jimmy \"Marved\" Nguyen who also competed under the OpTic Gaming core. \n\"Counter-Strike 2\".\nOn 27 November 2023, NRG announced a return to competitive \"Counter-Strike\" with the announcement of a new North American roster, featuring former Team Liquid players Damian \"daps\" Steele and Josh \"oSee\" Ohm, former Complexity player Justin \"FaNg\" Coakley and former Evil Geniuses players Jadan \"HexT\" Postma and Vincent \"Brehze\" Cayonte.\nFormer divisions.\n\"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\".\nOn 23 January 2016, NRG entered CS:GO with signing the ex-Method roster. 11 months later on 19 December, NRG completely changed their roster. On 27 July 2017, Peter \"ptr\" Gurney, who was the only player remaining from the original roster, left the team, replaced by Bulgarian Cvetelin \"CeRq\" Dimitrov a month later. In March 2018, NRG won the iBUYPOWER Invitational Spring 2018, beating Team Liquid. NRG's second victory came 5 months later in August 2018, after winning IEM Shangai 2018. NRG defeated OpTic Gaming to win cs_summit 3 in November 2018. On 28 February 2019, NRG signed former Cloud9 and MiBR member Tarık \"tarik\" Çelik to replace Jacob \"FugLy\" Medina.\nOn 26 September 2019, the NRG roster was acquired by Evil Geniuses, ending the 4 year CS:GO campaign of the organization.\n\"Dragon Ball FighterZ\".\nNRG entered the Dragon Ball FighterZ scene in 2018 with the signing of Eduardo \"HookGangGod\" Deno. His first win under the NRG banner was at Summit of Power 2018 where he took down SonicFox to take the title. Eduardo was also featured in his very own docuseries on Sony Crackle called \"Hook'D\". The 4-part series featured a cameo appearance from Shaquille O'Neal and debuted on July 27, 2018. NRG released HookGangGod on January 13, 2020.\n\"Smite\".\nOn September 1, 2016, NRG acquired defending Smite World Champions team Panthera. The team joined the organization following a hugely successful first 12 months; qualifying for Worlds as European runners up before dropping just 2 games on their way to the title. They followed this up by going 24–4 in the Spring split to qualify for the Dreamhack Masters in June, dominating the tournament and going undefeated 8–0 to be crowned Champions. The team has most recently won the 2016-2017 Smite World Champions. On December 13, 2018, NRG officially ended their \"Smite\" division.\n\"Super Smash Bros.\".\nNRG signed New Jersey native Nairoby \"Nairo\" Quezada for their \"Super Smash Bros.\" division in August 2016. On July 2, 2020, NRG cut ties with Nairo after allegations that he had been engaged in a sexual relationship with a minor in April 2017, effectively ending the team's \"Super Smash Bros.\" division."

The 32-year-old Porte, who placed fifth in the 2016 Tour, won the general classification in two stage races so far in 2017, the Tour Down Under and the Tour de Romandie, and came second in the Dauphiné. Quintana, third in the 2016 Tour, placed second at the Giro d'Italia, with overalls wins at the Tirreno–Adriatico and the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana earlier in the season. The two-time winner (2007 and 2009) 34-year-old Contador came second overall in four stage races in 2017 before the Tour, Paris–Nice, the Vuelta a Andalucía, the Volta a Catalunya and the Tour of the Basque Country. Bardet, the 2016 Tour runner-up, placed sixth overall in the Dauphiné, with his best other result sixth in the one-day Classic race Liège–Bastogne–Liège. Aru started the Tour sharing leadership of the team with the Dauphiné winner Fuglsang. Aru won the Italian National Road Race Championships a week before the Tour and placed fifth at the Dauphiné.\nThe sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins on the flat or hilly bunch sprint finishes were Peter Sagan (), Marcel Kittel (), Mark Cavendish (), André Greipel (), and Alexander Kristoff (). Others expected to contend for sprint finishes included Michael Matthews (), Arnaud Démare (), Dylan Groenewegen (), John Degenkolb (), Sonny Colbrelli () and Nacer Bouhanni (). Double reigning world road race champion Sagan had won the five previous points classifications of the Tour, one away from matching Erik Zabel's record of six from 1996 to 2001. His form in the 2017 season before the Tour included winning the one-day Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne race and the points classifications in Tirreno–Adriatico, the Tour de Suisse and the Tour of California. Kittel had gained eight wins so far in 2017, as well as the general and points classifications in the Dubai Tour at the start of the season. Cavendish's season before the Tour was affected by glandular fever, missing around three months; his only success had been a stage win and the points classification at the Abu Dhabi Tour. Greipel had amassed four wins in 2017 before the Tour, including one at the Giro. Kristoff had taken six wins so far in 2017, and the points classifications at the Tour of Oman, the Étoile de Bessèges and the Three Days of De Panne.\nRoute and stages.\nThe opening stages of the 2017 Tour (known as the \"Grand Départ\") were originally scheduled to be in London, United Kingdom; this would have been the third time the Tour had visited London, following the 2007 and 2014 editions. In September 2015, a week before this was due to be announced, Transport for London pulled out of the bid. It was later revealed that this was the decision of the then Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, on the grounds of cost: hosting the ' would have cost £35 million. In December 2015, the ASO announced that the ' would take place with stages based in Düsseldorf, the fourth time the Tour had begun in Germany and the first since 1987. The bid to host the Tour was only narrowly approved by the city council. The return to Germany followed a resurgence in German professional cycling. On 14 January 2016, details of the opening two stages were announced. The first stage would be a individual time trial in Düsseldorf itself. The second stage would also begin in Düsseldorf. The full route was announced by race director Christian Prudhomme on 18 October 2016 at the Palais des Congrès in Paris.\nAfter the first time trial, the race left Germany during stage two, which finished in the Belgian city of Liège. Stage three headed south, and after a brief passage through Luxembourg, ended with a climb in Longwy. After a transitional stage, stage five saw the first major climb, the finish at the La Planche des Belles Filles. The next two stages headed south-west, before stage eight in the Jura Mountains, featured three categorised climbs. The ninth stage included the steep climbs of the , the Col du Grand Colombier, and, after a 42-year absence, the Signal du Mont du Chat, its summit from the finish in Chambéry. After a transfer during the rest day, stage ten took place in the Dordogne region, between Périgueux and Bergerac. Stage eleven was a transitional stage, followed by two stages in the Pyrenees. Stage twelve started from Pau and ended at the Peyragudes ski resort. The next stage was short, at , but included three climbs before a descent finish into Foix. After leaving the Pyrenees, the riders headed north-east; stage fourteen finished with a climb towards the end of the stage. Stage fifteen featured the first appearance of the Col de Peyra Taillade, with its conclusion in Le Puy-en-Velay. Stage sixteen, the first after the final rest day, was a transitional stage, heading east, towards the Alps. Stage seventeen included the Col d'Ornon, the Col de la Croix de Fer, the Col du Télégraphe and the highest point of elevation in the race, the Col du Galibier, before a descent finish into Serre Chevalier. Stage eighteen was the final day of mountains; it had two climbs, the Col de Vars and the finishing climb, the Col d'Izoard. It was the first time the Tour finished on the -high mountain pass. After another transitional stage, heading south, came stage twenty, a individual time trial in Marseille. Starting at the Stade Vélodrome, the course headed around the city, designated the 2017 European Capital of Sport, before ending also at the Stade Vélodrome. The final stage began in Montgeron, which hosted the start of the first Tour, before concluding with the traditional laps of the Champs-Élysées.\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of , shorter than the 2016 Tour. There were two time trial events, both of which were individual, a total of . Of the remaining nineteen stages, eight were officially classified as flat, six as medium mountain and five as high mountain. The longest mass-start stage was stage nineteen, at , and the shortest was stage thirteen, at . For the first time since the 1992 edition, the route included all five of mainland France's mountainous regions; the Vosges, the Jura, the Pyrenees, the Massif Central and the Alps. There were summit finishes on stage twelve to Peyragudes and stage eighteen to the Col d'Izoard. Additionally, the hilly stage three had a hilltop finish in Longwy, and stage five ended at La Planche des Belles Filles. The highest point of the race was the -high Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage seventeen. It was among seven \"hors catégorie\" (English: \"out of category\") rated climbs in the race. There were ten new start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage nine, in the Dordogne, and fifteen, in Le Puy-en-Velay.\nRace overview.\nOpening stages, Vosges and Jura.\nThe opening stage's individual time trial was won by Geraint Thomas with a time of 16 min 4 s over the course. Thomas took the yellow and green jerseys as the leader of the general and points classifications respectively. Chris Froome was the highest placed of the general classification favourites, in sixth place, sixteen seconds down. Overall contender Alejandro Valverde crashed on the wet roads and his injuries forced him to withdraw from the Tour. Marcel Kittel won stage two's bunch sprint, and with it the green jersey. Breakaway rider Taylor Phinney () took the first polka dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification. The uphill sprint finish of stage three was won by Peter Sagan; Nathan Brown () took over the polka dot jersey. The fourth stage ended with a bunch sprint and was won by Démare, with him also taking the green jersey. There were two crashes leading up to the finish, the first was in the peloton around left and the second involved the sprinters at the end. In the sprint finish, Mark Cavendish crashed into the barriers at the side of the road, withdrawing later that day from the race from his injuries. Sagan, second in the stage, was disqualified after race officials judged that he caused Cavendish to crash, with the jury president Philippe Marien saying that he \"endangered some of his colleagues seriously\".\nThe near universal opinion among commentators and former riders was that a disqualification is not justified and even senseless. André Greipel, who had criticised Sagan right after the stage, also exonerated him after watching the replays. In December 2017, Sagan was officially exonerated by cycling's governing body, the \"Union Cycliste Internationale\" (UCI).\nIn the fifth stage, a group containing the overall contenders caught the last of the breakaway riders from the summit finish at the La Planche des Belles Filles. With remaining, Fabio Aru attacked and won with a margin of sixteen seconds over the group. Thomas lost twenty seconds on the group and lost the yellow jersey to teammate Froome. Aru took over the lead of the mountains classification. Kittel won the following two stages which ended in bunch sprints. The latter stage was decided by a photo finish, with Kittel ahead of Edvald Boasson Hagen (); Kittel regained the green jersey. In stage eight, the first high mountain stage, Lilian Calmejane of attacked over the category 1 climb of Montée de la Combe de Laisia Les Molunes from a six-strong lead breakaway and soloed for to take the win 37 seconds ahead of second-placed and lone chaser Robert Gesink (). Calmejane put himself into the polka dot jersey. The ninth stage saw a select group of general classification favourites join Warren Barguil () after the final climb of the Mont du Chat and contest a sprint finish, won by Rigoberto Urán (). Barguil took lead of the mountains classification. Upon crossing the finish line Barguil thought he won the stage while Uran showed no visible reaction. After a few moments to review the photo finish it was revealed that Uran's 'bike throw' got him over the line first to claim the stage win as Froome sprinted hard to earn a stage podium, but more importantly four bonus seconds to extend his overall lead.\nRichie Porte crashed heavily taking down Dan Martin while descending the Mont du Chat within the group of overall contenders. Porte withdrew from the race and was rushed to the hospital; fortunately he was in a stable condition. Dan Martin recovered and finished strongly. The following day was the Tour's first rest day.\nPyrenees and Massif Central.\nStages ten and eleven were won from bunch sprints by Kittel, taking his total of wins at the race to five. The twelfth stage saw the overall contenders all reach the foot of the short steep climb to Peyragudes; Romain Bardet won by a margin of two seconds. Froome came seventh, 22 seconds down, and lost the overall lead to third-placed Aru. The -long stage thirteen was won by Barguil, who won the sprint after a descent from an elite group with Nairo Quintana, Alberto Contador and Mikel Landa (). The chasing group of overall contenders came in 1 min 39 s down. In the fourteenth stage, a reduced peloton contested the uphill sprint finish at Rodez, which was won by Matthews. Aru's advantage of six seconds over Froome was changed to a deficit of eighteen, after Aru came in thirty seconds down in thirtieth place and Froome was seventh, one second behind Matthews.\nStage fifteen saw 's Bauke Mollema attack a breakaway group over the top of the Col de Peyra Taillade with to go and solo to victory. In the large group containing the overall contenders, Bardet's team forced a high pace on the Peyra Taillade. A further later on the climb, Froome suffered a broken spoke, and, after receiving a new wheel from a teammate and some assistance from three other teammates, he was able to chase back up to the group. The next day was the second rest day of the race. In the sixteenth stage, the high pace set by Matthews's dropped the green jersey wearer Kittel; Matthews, who was second to Kittel in points classification, won the stage. Primož Roglič (), second behind Barguil in the mountains classification, won the following mountainous stage after a solo attack on the Col du Galibier, finishing in Serre Chevalier after a descent over a minute ahead of a four-man group containing the new top three in the general classification: Froome, Urán, and Bardet, respectively; and also Barguil. Aru dropped from second overall to fourth. Kittel crashed and withdrew from the Tour, putting Matthews in the green jersey.\nAlps and finale.\nThe final high mountain stage of the Tour, the eighteenth, saw Barguil claim his second stage victory of the race on the summit finish at Col d'Izoard; he was initially caught by the group of overall favourites on the final climb after being the one of last survivors from the breakaway, with only Darwin Atapuma () ahead. Barguil's winning move came with remaining, passing Atapuma to win by twenty seconds. A three-way sprint for fourth place saw Bardet finish just ahead of Froome with Urán placing fifth; Bardet moved up to second overall, six seconds ahead of Urán, with Froome holding a 23-second advantage. Boasson Hagen won stage nineteen with an attack from a reduced breakaway with to go. Maciej Bodnar of won the individual time trial of the penultimate stage, setting a time of 28 min 15 s. Froome was third, six seconds down, increasing his lead in the general classification to 54 seconds. Bardet dropped to third overall after he lost over two minutes in the stage, and Urán was 31 seconds in arrears.\nThe final stage in Paris was won by Dylan Groenewegen in a bunch sprint on the Champs-Élysées. Froome finished the race to win his fourth Tour de France. Urán placed second overall, 54 seconds down, with Bardet 2 min 20 s behind, just one second ahead of Landa (fourth overall). Matthews won the points classification with a total of 370, 136 ahead of Greipel in second. Barguil won the mountains classification with 169 points, 89 ahead of second-placed Roglič. The best young rider was seventh-placed overall Simon Yates, who was followed by Louis Meintjes (eighth overall) in second, 2 min 6 s down. An rider won the classification for the second consecutive year, after Yates' twin brother Adam won in 2016. finished as the winners of the team classification, 7 min 14 s ahead of second-placed . Of the 198 starters, 167 reached the finish of the last stage in Paris.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were four main individual classifications being contested in the 2017 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses (time subtracted) were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the two individual time trials. The first three riders get 10, 6, and 4 seconds, respectively. For crashes within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, any rider involved received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered to be the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised, in order of increasing difficulty, as fourth-, third-, second-, and first-category and \"hors catégorie\". Double points were awarded on the summit finish of the Col d'Izoard on stage 18. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1992. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". No combativity awards were given for the time trials and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Warren Barguil won the overall super-combativity award, again, decided by a jury.\nA total of €2,280,950 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification received €500,000, with the second and third placed riders getting €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers in the top 160 were awarded with money. The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains were given €25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider collected €20,000. The team classification winners were given €50,000. €11,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2–20. There was also a special award with a prize of €5,000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier. This prize was won by Primož Roglič on stage seventeen.\nUCI rankings.\nRiders from the WorldTeams competing for individually and for their teams for points that contributed towards the World Tour rankings. Riders from both the WorldTeams and Professional Continental teams also competed individually and for their nations for points that contributed towards the UCI World Ranking, which included all UCI road races. Both rankings used the same points scale, awarding points to the top sixty in the general classification, each yellow jersey given at the end of a stage, the top five finishers in each stage and for the top three in the final points and mountains classifications. The points accrued by Chris Froome moved him from twentieth to sixth in the World Tour and kept his fifth place in the World Ranking. Greg Van Avermaet () held the lead of both individual rankings. and Belgium also holding the lead of the World Tour team ranking and World Ranking nation ranking, respectively."

        "title": "2017 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2017 proceeded according to rules most recently amended in 2016. As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players, with results announced on January 18, 2017. The BBWAA elected Jeff Bagwell, Tim Raines, and Iván Rodríguez to the Hall of Fame.\nThe three voting panels that had replaced the more broadly defined Veterans Committee following a July 2010 rules change were replaced by a new set of four panels in July 2016. The newly created Today's Game Committee convened early in December 2016 to select from a ballot of retired players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the sport after 1987. John Schuerholz and Bud Selig were elected by this committee.\nA formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 30, 2017.\nBBWAA election.\nOn July 26, 2014, the Hall announced changes to the rules for election for recently retired players, reducing the number of years a player will be eligible to be on the ballot from fifteen years to ten. One candidate presently on the BBWAA ballot (Lee Smith) in years 10-15 was grandfathered into this system and retained his previous 15 years of eligibility. In addition, BBWAA members who were otherwise eligible to cast ballots were required to complete a registration form and sign a code of conduct before receiving their ballots, and the Hall made public the names of all members who cast ballots (but not their individual votes) when it announced the election results. The code of conduct specifically states that the ballot is non-transferable, a direct reaction to Dan Le Batard turning his 2014 Hall of Fame ballot over to the sports website \"Deadspin\" and allowing the site's readers to make his Hall votes (an act that drew him a lifetime ban from future Hall voting). Violation of the code of conduct will result in a lifetime ban from BBWAA voting.\nA more recent rules change, announced on July 28, 2015, tightened the qualifications for the BBWAA electorate. Beginning with the 2016 election, eligible voters must not only have 10 years of continuous BBWAA membership, but also be currently active members, or have held active status within the 10 years prior to the election. A BBWAA member who has not been active for more than 10 years can regain voting status by covering MLB in the year preceding the election. As a result of the new rule, the vote total in 2016 decreased by 109 from the previous year, to 440.\nThe ballot included two categories of players:\nPlayers who were eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Josh Bard, Danys Báez, Milton Bradley, Russell Branyan, Juan Castro, Ramón Castro, Alex Cora, Craig Counsell, Jack Cust, Doug Davis, Adam Everett, Ryan Franklin, Ross Gload, Wes Helms, Mark Hendrickson, Scott Linebrink, Felipe López, Julio Lugo, Jason Michaels, Trever Miller, Corey Patterson, Joel Piñeiro, Dennys Reyes, Aaron Rowand, Marcus Thames, Brett Tomko, Javier Vázquez, and Chris Woodward.\n442 ballots were cast, 2 more than in 2016.\nThere were 442 total ballots cast, with 3595 individual votes for players, an average of 8.13 players named per ballot.\nJeff Bagwell, Tim Raines and Iván Rodríguez were elected. Raines and Lee Smith were on the ballot for their final time; Smith dropped off the ballot, while Raines was the fifth player to be elected in his final ballot, after Red Ruffing, Joe Medwick, Ralph Kiner, and Jim Rice. Rodríguez was elected in his first year of eligibility.\nVoting results from 2017:\nToday's Game Era Committee.\nOn July 23, 2016, the Hall of Fame announced changes to the Era Committee system. The system's timeframes were restructured to place a greater emphasis on the modern game, and to reduce the frequency at which individuals from the pre-1970 game (including Negro league baseball figures) will have their careers reviewed. Considering candidates whose greatest contributions occurred in 1988 and later, the Today's Game Era Committee met in 2016 as part of the elections for the next calendar year.\nOn October 3, 2016, the Hall announced the 10 candidates to be considered when the Today's Game Era Committee met at the 2016 winter meetings in National Harbor, Maryland on December 4; the voting results were announced immediately after the committee met. The cutoff for election and induction remained the standard 75%, or 12 of 16 votes.\nThe committee consisted of the following individuals:\nAll candidates except for Steinbrenner were alive when the ballot and the voting results were announced.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is now given the previous day at the Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum.\nThe three finalists for the 2017 award were announced during the 2016 All-Star break.\nOn December 6, during the 2016 winter meetings, Smith was named as the 2017 recipient. She received 272 of a possible 449 votes (with three ballots left blank). At the time of announcement, Smith was ESPN's news editor for remote production, with chief responsibility for incorporating news and analysis in the network's MLB-related broadcasts, as well as \"SportsCenter\". She became the first African-American woman, and the first woman of any ethnicity, to regularly cover MLB for a newspaper when she began covering the New York Yankees for \"The Hartford Courant\" in 1983. Smith went from there to \"The New York Times\" and \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" before joining ESPN.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nVarious changes in July 2016 were also made to the annual Ford C. Frick Award elections, presented annually to a preeminent baseball broadcaster since 1978. According to the Hall, the new criteria for selection are \"Commitment to excellence, quality of broadcasting abilities, reverence within the game, popularity with fans, and recognition by peers.\"\nAdditionally, a ballot of eight candidates will now be set, down from 10 in years past. The three ballot slots previously determined by fan voting on Facebook will now be filled by a committee of historians.\nA new election cycle has been established, rotating annually between \"Current Major League Markets\" (team-specific announcers) with the 2017 Frick Award; \"National Voices\" (broadcasters whose contributions were realized on a national level) with the 2018 Frick Award; and \"Broadcasting Beginnings\" (early team voices and pioneers of baseball broadcasting) with the 2019 Frick Award. This cycle will repeat every three years.\nThe Hall announced the ballot for the 2017 award on November 7, 2016, with voting to take place at the 2016 winter meetings on December 7. On December 7, it was announced that Bill King was the winner of the award.\nAt the time the ballot was announced, all candidates were living except King and Martin.\nBuck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award.\nAnother Hall of Fame honor, the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award, was also presented at the 2017 Awards Presentation. The award was created in 2008 in honor of Buck O'Neil, a Negro leagues star who went on to become one of baseball's leading ambassadors until his death in 2006. The first award was presented posthumously to O'Neil at the 2008 induction ceremony, and prior to 2017 had been presented two additional times. According to the Hall,The Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award is presented by the Hall of Fame's Board of Directors not more than once every three years to honor an individual whose extraordinary efforts enhanced baseball's positive impact on society, broadened the game's appeal, and whose character, integrity and dignity are comparable to the qualities exhibited by O'Neil.\nAs with the media awards, recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized by the Hall. In this case, the recipients are listed alongside a life-size statue of O'Neil that stands at the entrance to the museum. Written nominations for the award are accepted by mail at any time; the nomination must specifically state how the nominee meets the traits exemplified by O'Neil.\nOn May 25, 2017, the Hall announced that Rachel Robinson, widow of Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson, would be the 2017 recipient. Before Jackie's passing in 1972, the couple established the Jackie Robinson Development Corporation, which builds and manages affordable housing. The following year, she established the Jackie Robinson Foundation to provide college scholarships and leadership training. In announcing the award, Hall of Fame chair Jane Forbes Clark said, \"Rachel Robinson has worked tirelessly to raise the level of equality not only in baseball, but throughout society.\""

        "text": "The Pakistani national cricket team toured the West Indies from March 2017 to May 2017. The tour consisted of a series of three Test matches, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and four Twenty20 internationals (T20Is). The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) looked at the possibility of playing the T20I matches at the Central Broward Regional Park in Florida, as they did against India in August 2016. However, the WICB kept all the fixtures for this tour in the Caribbean.\nIn January 2017, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) made an offer to the WICB to play two T20I matches in Pakistan. They would have been held in Lahore on 18 and 19 March 2017, with the teams playing two more T20Is in Lauderhill, Florida. However, when the tour fixtures were confirmed by the WICB on 12 January 2017, there was no mention of the matches in Pakistan. Later the same day the WICB confirmed that the West Indies would not play in Pakistan due to security concerns. Originally the tour was scheduled to contain two T20I matches, but early in March 2017, two extra T20I fixtures were added to the schedule.\nAhead of the tour, Misbah-ul-Haq confirmed he would continue as captain of the Pakistan Test side, a decision accepted by the PCB. In April 2017, Misbah announced that he would be retiring from international cricket at the end of the series. Two days later, Younis Khan also announced that he would retire from Test cricket following the conclusion of the series.\nPakistan won the T20I series 3–1, and the ODI series 2–1. They also won the Test series 2–1, their first Test series win in the West Indies.\nSquads.\nVeerasammy Permaul was added to the West Indies ODI squad ahead of the third match as cover for Shannon Gabriel."

        "text": "The 1950/1951 News of the World Snooker Tournament was a professional snooker tournament sponsored by the \"News of the World\". The tournament was won by Alec Brown who won all his 7 matches, finishing ahead of John Pulman who won 5 matches. The News of the World Snooker Tournament ran from 1949/50 to 1959.\nFormat.\nThe 1950/51 event was a round-robin snooker tournament and was played from 9 October 1950 to 20 January 1951. All matches were played at Leicester Square Hall in London. There were 8 competitors and a total of 28 matches. There were 8 competitors: Joe Davis, Fred Davis, Walter Donaldson, Albert Brown, Horace Lindrum, John Pulman and Sidney Smith together with Alec Brown who had won the qualifying event. Each match lasted three days and was the best of 37 frames.\nUnlike the previous year's tournament, each match was separately handicapped. Joe Davis played level with Walter Donaldson and gave Fred Davis 10, Albert Brown, Horace Lindrum and Sidney Smith, John Pulman 25 and Alec Brown 30. Fred Davis played level with Walter Donaldson and Horace Lindrum and gave Albert Brown 10, Sidney Smith 14, John Pulman 16 and Alec Brown 21. Walter Donaldson gave Albert Brown, Horace Lindrum and Sidney Smith 10, John Pulman 16 and Alec Brown 21. Albert Brown played level with John Pulman and gave Sidney Smith 3, Horace Lindrum 7 and Alec Brown 10. Horace Lindrum played level with Sidney Smith and gave John Pulman 7 and Alec Brown 11. Sidney Smith gave John Pulman 7 and Alec Brown 11. John Pulman gave Alec Brown 11.\nResults.\nIn his last match John Pulman, receiving 25 points each frame, beat Joe Davis to move into second place in the table. Joe Davis still had one match to play and could retake second place by winning 22 frames against his brother Fred in his last match. Even though he had a break of 140 on the second day, Joe trailed 14–10 and could no longer get second place. Fred eventually won 22–15.\nJoe Davis made a break of 143 in the third frame of his match against Walter Donaldson. He potted all the red, 12 blacks, 2 pinks and a blue and then all the colours. He made a break of 101 the following day.\nTable\nThe positions were determined firstly by the number of matches won (MW) and, in the event of a tie, the number of frames won (FW).\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying tournament was played from 18 September to 7 October 1950. These matches were also played at Leicester Square Hall in London. As in the main event, each match lasted three days and was the best of 37 frames. There were 4 competitors: John Barrie, Alec Brown, Kingsley Kennerley and Sydney Lee. John Barrie and Alec Brown each won their first two matches which meant that the final match, between the two, would decide the winner. Alec Brown won a close match 19–18. Kingsley Kennerley had beaten Sydney Lee 21–16 in their final match."

        "title": "2016 Serena Williams tennis season",
        "text": "The 2016 Serena Williams tennis season officially began on 5 January with the start of the 2016 Hopman Cup. Williams entered the season as the number one ranked player and the defending champion at five tournaments, including the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon.\nOn the week of September 5, 2016, Williams tied Steffi Graf for the longest consecutive weeks as World No. 1 at 186 weeks.\nOn July 9, 2016, Williams defeated Angelique Kerber in the finals at Wimbledon to claim her 22nd major singles title and tie the Open Era record for Grand Slam singles titles with Steffi Graf.\nYear in detail.\nAustralian Open Series.\nHopman Cup.\nFor the second consecutive year and for the fourth time in her career Williams started her season at the Hopman Cup. Williams partnered Jack Sock for the event and was originally set to start her campaign against Ukraine's Elina Svitolina but withdrew before the match citing knee inflammation. The world No.1 took to the court for the first time against Australia Gold's Jarmila Wolfe and, after dropping the first set, retired from the match due to the recurring inflammation in her knee. Despite retiring from her first match Williams remained optimistic that the swelling would go down before the first major of the year. The following day she announced she was pulling out of the tie against the Czech Republic. Williams was replaced by Vicky Duval.\nAustralian Open.\nWilliams returned to competitive action for the first time in four months at the season's first major. As the defending champion the world No. 1 sought to add a seventh Australian Open title to her haul. In the opening round Williams faced off against the highest ranked unseeded player Camila Giorgi. Williams needed just a single break in each set to secure a straight sets victory and advance to the second round. Her opponent in the second round was former doubles world No.1 Hsieh Su-wei. Williams lost just three games and wrapped up her victory in an hour to set up a third round against Russia's Daria Kasatkina. The world No. 1 overwhelmed her young Russian opponent, for the loss of two games, in 44 minutes to reach the second week of the tournament. Serena would continue her dominant form by dispatching Margarita Gasparyan in a rematch of their 2015 first round Wimbledon encounter. Just as in their previous match, Serena served first and was broken but she responded by reeling in the next four games before breaking for a third time in the eighth game to take the first set. She then won the second set with the drop of one game. In the quarterfinals, Serena faced her long-time rival Maria Sharapova in a rematch of the 2015 Australian Open Final. It was their twenty-first encounter, properly beginning with a very tight first set that began with Serena's slow start. Serena quickly regrouped and managed to break Sharapova in the ninth game, needing 5 break points to do so. She served out the first set and then won the first five games of the second set. She then closed out the match after Maria avoided the bagel with her last service game. Serena faced Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals. Serena bagelled her in the first set in 21 minutes with only four unforced errors. The second set was tighter with Serena being broken when serving at 3–2. Serena managed to break back in the ninth game and serve out the match. Serena faced Angelique Kerber in her 26th Grand Slam final as the overwhelming favorite in her efforts to match the Open Era record in Grand Slams, but Serena was defeated in three close sets, her first defeat in the finals of the Australian Open, her first defeat in a three-set Grand Slam Final, and her first defeat in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 U.S. Open. Bearing the weight of history on her shoulders, Serena failed to display the dominant form that helped her reach the final without dropping a set. The match featured Serena committing 46 unforced errors when she has averaged as 20 unforced errors before the final. Throughout the tournament, Serena displayed confident net skills that she lacked in 2015, but they proved to be part of her downfall as she won less than 50% of her points at the net.\nEarly Hard Court Season.\nIndian Wells.\nRebounding from her loss in the Australian Open, Serena opened her Indian Wells campaign by handily defeating Laura Siegemund of Germany with the loss of only three games to advance to the third round, having received a bye in the first. Serena proceeded to fave Yulia Putintseva for the second time in her career. Serena was broken twice at the end of the first set and broke back both times to force a tie-break, which she won. Serena committed nearly 30 errors in the first set and cut down her mistakes to but five errors in the second to win 7–6(2), 6–0. Serena faced Kateryna Bondarenko in the fourth round and defeated her 6–2, 6–2. She then faced defending champion Simona Halep in the match they would have had the previous year. Despite failing to serve out the first set at 5–3. Serena broke back and ultimately won in straight sets. Serena then faced Agnieszka Radwańska in a rematch of their Australian Open semifinal. Radwanka began the match aggressively, breaking Serena early and setting up a double break point, but Serena saved it and won seven straight games from 2–4 down in the first set to win the set and lead 3–0 in the second. Errors returned to Serena's racket and Radwanka battled to break Serena twice in an effort to serve out the set 6–5, but Serena broke back to force a tie-break during which she won the seven straight points after losing the first. Serena Williams faced a resurgent Victoria Azarenka in their twenty-first career meeting. Nervous, Serena committed two double faults and two errors to be broken at love. Though she constructed several break back points, Azarenka saved them all and won the first set 6–4. Serena then went down 5–1 quickly in the second set to before finding her game to real in the next three games and establish a 15–40 on Azarenka's serve. As in the Australian Open final, Serena failed to take her chances to level the set at five all and she lost the next four points, thus losing to Azarenka 6–4, 6–4 for the first time since 2013 as well ending her 15-match winning streak at the tournament. Azarenka also became the first woman to defeat Serena four times in a final.\nMiami.\nWilliams entered Miami as a three-time defending champion. After a first round bye, she defeated Christina McHale in the second round and Zarina Diyas in the third round before succumbing in the fourth round to long-time rival Svetlana Kuznetsova in a three set match that included a very tight first set. This match ended a 20-match unbeaten run at the Miami Open.\nClay Season.\nItalian Open.\nIn Rome, Williams played her first clay court match of the season against Anna-Lena Friedsam in the second round and won easily. In the following rounds, Williams failed to drop a set en route to the final, defeating Christina McHale, Svetlana Kuznetsova, and Irina-Camelia Begu all in straight sets. By doing so, Williams reached her third final of the year, hoping to finally capture her 70th overall title. In the final, Williams faced fellow American Madison Keys in a rare all-American clay court final. After a tense first set, Williams was able to defeat Keys 7-6(5), 6-3 for her 70th overall singles title in her career.\nFrench Open.\nFollowing her victory in Rome, Williams returned to Paris as the defending champion and the favorite to defend her French Open crown. However, she had to face the task of defending her No. 1 ranking. Williams opened her title defense against Magdaléna Rybáriková, defeating her easily with the loss of two games to advance to the second round. Williams continued her campaign against Teliana Pereira, again achieving an easy victory of 6–2,6-1. In the third round, Williams faced Kristina Mladenovic of France. Williams took the first set 6–4 in the only break of the match, occurring in the last game of the set. In the second set, Williams did not face a break point with great serving, but she her return game was much sloppier during break opportunities, establishing a 40–0 lead on Mladenovic serve twice only to lose the game. Williams was forced into a tie break that followed a rain delay. When play resumed, Williams fell behind in the tie break 2-5 before asserting herself to match point. She held four match points in the tie break and had to save one set point before closing out the match with an 11–9 edge. A rain delay prevented Williams from playing her fourth round encounter for several days, ultimately forcing her to play four days in a row if she were to advance to the finals. Due to the rain, court conditions were much heavier. Williams eventually faced Elina Svitolina, who was under the charge of one of Williams' greatest rivals, Justine Henin. Williams erased her poor play from the third round to overwhelm Svitolina 6–1,6-1. Following the defeats of Angelique Kerber and Agnieszka Radwańska by the fourth round, Williams kept her top ranking.\nIn the quarterfinals, Williams faced first time Grand Slam quarterfinalist Yulia Putintseva in a rematch of their Indian Wells encounter. While Putintseva's play was exceptional and fearless, errors flowed from Williams' racket in the first set. At 5-all in the first, Williams established a 40–0 lead in her own service game and was broken with a stream of poor decisions, errors, and Putintseva's consistency, allowing Putintseva eventually take the set. Williams was broken at the start of the second but went on to reel in the next for games confidently before again squandering a definitive lead. At 4-all on her own serve, Williams was nearly broken again, but saved the break point to win the game and eventually the set on a double fault from Putintseva. Williams finally corrected her game in the third to claim the match 5–7,6-4,6-1. Following the match, Williams was outed as suffering an adductor injury, but she refused to acknowledge the injury any further than having \"some problems.\" Williams then faced Kiki Bertens, who was in her first Grand Slam semifinal and on a 12-match winning streak but also suffering her own calf injury. Regardless, Bertens played confident and fearless tennis, breaking the hampered Williams early and having her own set point on Williams' serve. Williams saved the set point to win three straight games, but Bertens managed to force a tie-break. In the breaker, both players had set points, but Williams took the first set with a 9–7 edge. In the second, Williams took advantage of Bertens' increasingly hampered movement with well-executed drop shots. She won the match 7-6(7), 6–4. In the finals, Williams faced Garbiñe Muguruza in a rematch of their 2015 Wimbledon encounter. Williams began the match brightly with strong serving, but her first-serve percentage decreased while Muguruza's aggressiveness and confidence increased. Though Williams constructed break points well, Muguruza's clutch performance on big points allowed her to take the opening set. Williams' level did not rise in the second set, and she went down an early break. While she managed to save three championship points on her own serve, Muguruza took the final game at love to clinch her first Grand Slam singles title 7–5, 6–4.\nWilliams' defeat was represented her first defeat in back-to-back Grand Slam Finals though she ultimately completed the Career Slam Runner-Up. Her defeat was also written by tennis experts and commentators as a changing of the guard in women's tennis, led by Muguruza, with doubt that Williams could make a solid comeback following her U.S. Open defeat the previous year or make a claim at Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam singles title. However, Williams' consistency to regularly advance to tournament finals placed herself at the top of the leader-board in the Race to Singapore.\nWimbledon.\nAfter failing to reach her 22nd major title once more at the French Open, Williams was faced with doubt and uncertainty by tennis experts, commentators, and the general media for her inability to perform to her usual standard in tournament finals. Therefore, she entered Wimbledon as an uneasy favorite for the title. Serena opened her campaign with a victory against Amra Sadiković, defeating her in two comfortable sets. Williams then faced Christina McHale for the third time this season in the second round. Williams was fully tested and pushed to the limit by Christina's resilient tennis. Christina broke Serena's serve early but Williams pegged back to get the match back on serve, leading into a tie break that Williams lost 9–7. It was Williams' first tiebreak loss of the season. Williams played much more confident and aggressive tennis in the second set to claim it, but in the third, McHale raised her level even further to break early. William' ultimately got the match back on serve before breaking again in the ninth game then closing out her final game with three consecutive aces to win the match 6(7)-7, 6–2, 6–4. After losing the first set, Williams smashed her racket and received a $10,000 fine for unsportsmanlike conduct. Despite the setback, Williams' performance for the rest of the championship drastically altered and improved to produce the best tennis she had executed all season following her burst of anger.\nWilliams quickly demonstrated her improvement during her third round encounter against German Annika Beck, held during People's Sunday due to the multiple rain delays of the tournament. Williams went down a break early in the first set, but then won 11 of the last twelve games in an overwhelming performance to win the match 6–3.6-0. Williams' victory earned her, her 300th victory at a Grand Slam, surpassing Chris Evert and being six Grand Slam match victories from tying Martina Navratilova. In the fourth round, Williams faced rival Svetlana Kuznetsova for the third time this season. The first set of the match proved tight with both players breaking each other twice, during which rain suspended the match at 5 all when Williams broke back as Kuznetsova was serving for the set. The roof over Centre Court was closed and the match resumed with Williams returning to her imperious form to claim final eight games of the match. Williams accumulated 43 winners, 14 aces, and 14 unforced errors, whereas Kuznetsova only won 42 points on the match. In the quarterfinals, Williams faced Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Williams maintained her perfect record against the Russian in a tight 6–4,6-4 straight sets victory that only featured one break of serve in both sets due to both players serving and defending brilliantly in an exhibition of power tennis. Williams did not face a break point during the match. In the semifinals, Williams faced fellow veteran and resurgent Elena Vesnina in her first ever Grand Slam semi-final. Williams took advantage of Vesnina's nerves from the onset and completely overwhelmed her in a 48-minute display of consistency, movement, and power in a 6–2,6-0 victory. Williams did not face a break point. She hammered 28 winners with 11 aces and only suffered 7 unforced errors to advance to the finals. Williams' quick victory marked the shortest women's Wimbledon semifinal in history. However, the victory was only Williams' second quickest routing of an opponent in a semi-final, which she did so against Sara Errani during the 2013 French Open.\nAt the beginning of the Championships, Williams' No. 1 ranking was again in jeopardy, but she kept her top ranking by advancing to the finals while enjoying her 300th week at the top of the WTA. In the finals, Williams faced Angelique Kerber in a rematch of their Australian Open encounter, and it was the first Grand Slam since Amélie Mauresmo and Justine Henin in 2006 that featured the same pair of Grand Slam finalists in the same year. En route to the final, Kerber had defeated Serena's sister Venus Williams in the semi-final, thus ruining a highly anticipated all-Williams final, which would have been the first since 2009. During the match, Williams was far sharper and more prepared for Kerber's defensive game and sharp cross court angles than she was in Australia. Williams earned her revenge against Kerber (and avenged sister Venus) in straight sets in a high quality contest that featured only one break of serve in both sets. Williams offered only one break point during the entire match, which she erased with an ace that accompanied the 12 others that passed by Kerber in an impeccable display of serving, during which Williams also struck 27 unreturnable serves and boasted an 88% first serve percentage. Williams continued to strike a powerful offensive game with a 39-21 ratio of winners to unforced errors while Kerber had only a 12-9 ratio. Williams' victory at Wimbledon allowed to be the first to qualify for the 2016 WTA Finals. More importantly, her victory allowed her to tie Steffi Graf's Open Era Grand Slam record of 22 major titles, and place her two Grand Slam victories behind the all-time record held by Margaret Court. \nWilliams' performance in singles was enhanced by the effort she and Venus placed in their doubles tournament of the Championship. Unseeded, the Williams sisters dropped one set in the quarterfinals to ultimately win their 6th Wimbledon Doubles title and their 14th Grand Slam Doubles title by defeating Tímea Babos and Yaroslava Shvedova, leaving their perfect record of Grand Slam doubles finals intact.\nUS Open Series &amp; Olympics.\nOn July 24, Williams withdrew from Rogers Cup citing a shoulder inflammation injury in which was the defending semifinalist. She subsequently participated in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro where she was the defending gold medalist in both singles and doubles. In the first round of the doubles competition, partnering with her sister Venus they lost to the Czech duo of Lucie Šafářová and Barbora Strýcová, ending their career record of 15–0 dating back to the 2000 Olympics. In singles, after victories over Daria Gavrilova and Alizé Cornet in the first two rounds, Williams faced Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the third round in what was a rematch of this year's French Open quarterfinal. However, she lost to the Ukrainian 4–6, 3–6. Days after the Olympics, Williams took a late wildcard for the Western &amp; Southern Open, where she was the defending champion, but then decided to withdraw due to concerns from the same shoulder injury/inflammation from earlier in the summer.\nUS Open.\nAfter a successful 22nd Grand Slam win in Wimbledon, injury woes and an Olympic defeat, Williams hoped to achieve her bid on a record 23rd Grand Slam in her career and a further 7th US Open win. At the first round, she opened her campaign against Russian veteran and Olympic Women's Doubles champion Ekaterina Makarova in the first round on their sixth meeting, as Williams got stronger on her victory and winning in two straight sets. Facing with injuries from weeks back, Williams improved well with the game meant her injury was fine. Williams then faced fellow American opponent Vania King in the second round that was Williams' 900th career match, which she won in two consecutive straight set victory in a row lasted in one hour and five minutes. By the third round, Williams faced Swedish rival Johanna Larsson, the match lasted an hour and a third consecutive straight set win. In the fourth round, she had an encounter with Yaroslava Shvedova. Williams won the match in another straight set victory with a time of two 34-minute intervals per set. In the quarterfinal stage, Williams faced against Simona Halep on what was the rematch of the Indian Wells quarterfinal earlier in the year, Williams started a tough momentum on the first set. By the second set, Williams struggled to keep on a pace staved off with 12 breaks points which Williams could not keep up, Halep won the set. On the third set, Williams came with two break points to win and advanced through the semifinal. In the semifinals, Williams faced Czech Karolína Plíšková in her first Grand Slam semifinal. Williams started the semifinal sluggish and never regained any momentum as Pliskova beat Williams for the first time and entered her first Grand Slam final. Throughout the final, Williams seemed to struggle with a knee injury which limited her ability to chase down shots from Pliskova. This ended her bid to take the 23rd Grand Slam victory and lost the World No. 1 ranking to eventual champion Angelique Kerber.\nRemainder of the season.\nOn September 23, Williams announced she has withdrawn in both the Wuhan Open and China Open due to the same injury sustained from Wimbledon earlier that year. Nearly a month later, Williams had pulled out on the WTA Finals from a continuous injury.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nWilliams' 2016 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\nDoubles schedule.\nWilliams' 2016 doubles tournament schedule is as follows:\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\n\"Ordered by percentage of wins\""

        "text": "Andy Murray's 2016 tennis season began at the Australian Open. The 2016 season was Murray's greatest season, as he finished the season as the year-end world No. 1 player and clinched the year-end prize money title. Andy and Jamie Murray, also became the first brothers to finish as year-end No. 1 ranked players in singles and doubles team, respectively. He won an ATP-best and career-high nine Tour titles from 13 finals (from 17 tournaments), including his second Wimbledon crown and second successive Olympic gold medal in singles, thus becoming the first person, man or woman, to defend the Olympic singles title. In the 2016 season, Murray became the first male player to win singles titles at a Grand Slam, the Olympics, a Masters 1000 event, and the ATP Finals in the same calendar year (Serena Williams, in 2012, is the only other person to accomplish this feat). \nOn 7 November, Murray became the first British man and 26th male player to attain the world No. 1-ranking in singles since records began in 1973, displacing long-time rival and friend, Novak Djokovic. At , Murray is the oldest first-time singles No. 1 in the last 40 years. He reached the No. 1 ranking despite the fact that, in contrast to previous years, no ranking points were awarded for the Olympics. Djokovic had a 3–2 edge in matches between the two in 2016, including winning their two matches in Grand Slam finals (Australian and French Opens). Murray had a 1–1 record against Rafael Nadal in the year.\nThe following are also career firsts for a single season for Murray: (1) won ≥$16,000,000 in prize money, (2) amassed 78 match wins, (3) reached 13 Tour finals, (4) won nine Tour titles, (5) won three Masters 1000 titles, (6) reached five Masters 1000 finals, (7) reached three Grand Slam finals, (8) won 24 consecutive matches, (9) won five consecutive tournament titles, (10) reached seven consecutive tournament finals, (11) won 16 matches against top-10 opponents. \nMurray ended the season by winning his last 24 matches, reaching the finals in 12 of his last 13 tournaments, and winning titles in his last five tournaments. In winning the 2016 ATP WTF, Murray defeated the No. 2 (Djokovic), No. 3 (Wawrinka), No. 4 (Raonic), No. 5 (Nishikori), and No. 7 (Cilic) in 5 consecutive matches.\nYear summary.\nAustralian Open and early hard court season.\nPrior to the Australian Open, Murray paired with Heather Watson to compete in the Hopman Cup. They were knocked out in the round robin stage after winning 2 out of 3 ties.\nAustralian Open.\nMurray came through the opening two rounds of the Australian Open in straight sets against Alexander Zverev and Sam Groth for a combined loss of only 11 games. He followed this up with a four set win over João Sousa in the third round and a straight set win over Bernard Tomic in the fourth round to reach the quarterfinals.\nIn the quarterfinals Murray defeated David Ferrer in four sets. The match lasted over three hours, however Ferrer did not manage to hit a single ace.\nMurray next played Milos Raonic in the semifinals. In another long affair, lasting over four hours, Murray came through in five sets to reach his fifth Australian Open Final.\nIn the final Murray played Novak Djokovic. It was their fourth meeting in an Australian Open final, with Djokovic having won the other three. Murray was not able to overcome the Serb and after losing the first five games ended up going down in three sets.\nDavis Cup First round.\nAfter taking February off to spend time with his new daughter, Sophia, Murray returned to action against Japan in the first round of the Davis Cup.

Several commentators suggested that Murray was looking \"exhausted\", and that his form had appeared to drop since becoming a father for the first time.\nEuropean clay court season and Roland Garros.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nIn his first tournament on clay of the year, Murray beat Pierre-Hugues Herbert in his first match in three sets and recovered from a set and double-break down to beat Benoît Paire, reaching his first quarter-final since the Australian Open.

In the tournament itself, Murray recorded victories over Mikhail Kukushkin, Jérémy Chardy, David Goffin and Lucas Pouille, all in straight sets, to reach his first final in the Rome Masters. Once again he faced Djokovic, but this time won, again in straight sets, to win his first title of 2016 and 12th Masters title overall, as a result returning to the #2 ranking.\nRoland Garros.\nIn his first round match, Murray was drawn against Radek Štěpánek and lost the first two sets, winning the third set before the match was suspended due to bad light.

Murray reached the final after defeating Marin Čilić in the semi-finals, and won the title after coming from a set and a break down to defeat Milos Raonic for the third time in 2016. With this win Murray became the first person ever to win five titles at Queen's club.\nWimbledon Championships.\nAfter straight-sets victories over Liam Broady, Lu Yen-hsun, John Millman and Nick Kyrgios, Murray reached his ninth consecutive quarter-final at Wimbledon. He then defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in five sets, having been two sets up, to reach the semi-final for the seventh time, where he won in straight sets against Tomáš Berdych, reaching his third Slam final of 2016 and eleventh overall, more than any other British male player. For the first time in a Slam final, Murray's opponent was neither Djokovic nor Federer but Milos Raonic, who had beaten Federer in the semi-finals, while Djokovic had lost earlier to Sam Querrey. Murray won the match in straight sets, winning his third Grand Slam title and second at Wimbledon.\nOlympics and US Open.\nMurray chose not to play in the quarter-final of the Davis Cup World Group against Serbia, which the Great Britain team nevertheless won, and did not defend his title at the Canadian Open.\nRio Olympic Games.\nMurray recorded victories over Viktor Troicki, Juan Mónaco, Fabio Fognini, Steve Johnson and Kei Nishikori to reach his sixth consecutive final in all tournaments played. In the final he defeated Juan Martín del Potro in four sets to secure his second Gold Medal in Olympics singles tennis, becoming the first male to win two singles Gold Medals and to successfully defend an Olympic singles title.\nCincinnati Masters.\nAt the Cincinnati Masters Murray continued his good form by beating Juan Mónaco, Kevin Anderson, and Bernard Tomic. He next faced Milos Raonic and won in straight sets to make it to the final for a third time, however lost to Marin Cilic. His loss to Cilic in the final was the first time since 2012 (l. Federer 2012 Wimbledon final) that someone other than Djokovic defeated him in a Tour final. Despite the loss, Murray recorded his best winning streak of his career, extending to 22 straight matches following his semifinal victory over Raonic.\nUS Open.\nMurray entered the US Open as second seed, with the chance to reach all four Slam finals in a year. Victories over Lukas Rosol, Marcel Granollers, Paolo Lorenzi (in four sets) and Grigor Dimitrov saw him reach the quarter-finals, where he faced Kei Nishikori. Despite winning the first set easily, and then leading two sets to one, Nishikori eventually prevailed in five sets.\nDavis Cup Semi-finals.\nWith Team GB victorious in the World Group quarter finals in the absence of Murray, he returned for the semi-final against Argentina. In the first rubber, Murray and del Potro contested a five-set match, with del Potro eventually emerging as the winner. Murray teamed up with his brother Jamie to win the doubles, keeping Team GB in the tie, and then beat Guido Pella in three sets to take the tie to 2–2. Dan Evans would lose the deciding rubber, and Great Britain were unable to defend their Davis Cup title.\nAsian Swing and End of Season.\nChina Open.\nDefending champion Novak Djokovic had withdrawn from the China Open, leaving Murray as the top seed. He went on to win the title for the first time, defeating Andreas Seppi, Andrey Kusnetsov, Kyle Edmund and David Ferrer on his way to the final, where he beat Grigor Dimitrov. Murray won each match in straight sets.\nShanghai Masters.\nMurray continued his strong form in Shanghai, winning the tournament for the third time in his career and without dropping a set. After defeating Steve Johnson, Lucas Pouille, David Goffin and Gilles Simon, he faced Roberto Bautista Agut, who had reached his first Masters final after beating the defending champion Djokovic in the semi-final. After coming through a tight first set, Murray won the second set for the loss of a single game. These back-to-back tournament victories, combined with Djokovic's own dip in form, meant that Murray was within a thousand points of Djokovic in the ATP race rankings.\nVienna Open.\nMurray brought his current win streak to 15 consecutive match wins by winning the Erste Bank Open for his 7th Tour title of the 2016 season. In his last 11 tournaments, Murray has reached the finals 10 times, including a career-best seven consecutive finals which ended with his quarter-final showing at the US Open. His tournament started slowly with 3-set wins over Martin Klizan and Gilles Simon in the first two rounds. However, a decisive win over John Isner in the quarter-finals and a walkover due to Ferrer's withdrawal with a leg injury saw Murray reach the final. There he defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, for his third title in succession. The result saw Murray win seven titles in a single season for the first time in his career, and move to sole possession of 15th place on the all-time list of singles titles in the Open Era, breaking a tie with former world No. 1 Stefan Edberg. The win also took Murray over $10,000,000 prize money in a single season for the first time in his career.\nParis Masters.\nWith Djokovic's loss in the quarter-finals, Murray could become World No. 1 for the first time if he reached the final. In his first match Murray edged a tight three-set match against Fernando Verdasco, facing two break points in his last service game before winning eight straight points to take the match. Murray then beat Lucas Pouille for the third time in 2016 in straight sets for the loss of only three games, and reached the semi-final after beating Tomas Berdych in straight sets, despite facing five set points in a row in the first-set tie break. A walkover into the final, courtesy of Milos Raonic withdrawing, confirmed Murray as the new world No. 1. This was Murray's fifth consecutive Masters 1000 final (he skipped Canada); prior to this, his personal best was 2 consecutive Masters 1000 finals. He then won the Paris Masters for the first time in his career, beating John Isner 6–3 6–7(4) 6–4 for his 19th consecutive match win. His Paris crown means that Murray has now won 7 of the 9 different Masters 1000 events and is only missing Indian Wells and Monte Carlo.\nWorld Tour Finals.\nMurray was drawn in the same group as Marin Cilic, Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka. He won all three of his group matches, including straight-sets wins over Cilic and Wawrinka, either side of a three-set match against Nishikori that set the record for longest match since the Tour Finals were hosted in London, at 3 hours 20 minutes. In the semi-final Murray defeated Milos Raonic for the sixth time in 2016, coming from a set down and breaking the record for longest match for the second time in a week at 3 hours 38 minutes.\nIn the final, Murray faced four-time defending champion Novak Djokovic. Murray won in straight sets. This saw Murray claim his first ATP World Tour Finals title, his ninth title of 2016, and ensured that he would hold the year-end No. 1 ranking for the first time. In his very first tournament as the world No. 1, arguably the most impressive facet of the event was defeating the world No. 7 Cilic, No. 5 Nishikori, No. 3 Wawrinka, No. 4 Raonic, and No. 2 Djokovic in five successive matches. The last time a player defeated 5 of the top-7 players was when Roger Federer defeated No. 7 Ferrer, No. 5 Murray, No. 4 Soderling, No. 3 Djokovic, and No. 1 Nadal in the 2010 event. It also meant that Murray would finish the season with his 24th consecutive match win.\nAll matches.\nSingles.\n \n \n "

Alec Brown led 16–12 after the final afternoon session but Albert Brown won all 7 frames in the evening session to win 19–18.\nAfter Albert Brown's 19–18 win, Sidney Smith needed to beat Walter Donaldson 21–16 to win the tournament. Smith led 16–14 after the final afternoon session but Donaldson won the first two frames on the final evening to tie the match at 16–16. Smith then won the last 5 frames to win the match 21–16 and take the tournament by a single frame, 169 to Brown's 168.\nIn the last match of the tournament Fred Davis beat brother Joe 20–17, playing on level terms.

Donaldson, however, held on and won the match 18–17.\nTable\nThe positions were determined firstly by the number of matches won (MW) and, in the event of a tie, the number of frames won (FW).\nQualifying.\nWith the main event starting earlier than in previous years, the qualifying tournament was also earlier and was held from 28 May to 16 June 1951. These matches were also played at Leicester Square Hall in London. There were 3 competitors: John Barrie, Kingsley Kennerley and Sydney Lee. Unlike the main event, each match lasted six days and was the best of 73 frames. Barrie won both his matches to qualify. Kennerley beat Lee in the other match."

For the Tide's two games in the 2015 National Invitation Tournament, Brannen served as interim head coach.\nCoaching career.\nBrannen held assistant coaching positions at Charleston, Eastern Kentucky and St. Bonaventure before being hired by former Marshall assistant Anthony Grant, who had just been named head coach at VCU. Brannen spent three seasons at VCU before following Grant to Alabama, where he was an assistant for six seasons (the last two as associate head coach). When Grant was fired following the Tide's 2015 SEC tournament loss, Brannen was named interim head coach for the team's NIT appearance. The Tide were knocked out of the tournament by Miami in the second round following a first round home win over Illinois.\nNorthern Kentucky.\nBrannen is a Kentucky native and was named the head coach of NKU, the fifth in program history, on April 7, 2015. In 2017, Brannen led the Norse to the Horizon League championship and the NCAA tournament in the school's first season of full Division I eligibility, the first team since 1970 to do so. Brannen was also named the 2017 Coach of the Year in the Horizon League. In his four season with the Norse Brannen earned two NCAA berths, two Horizon League regular season titles, and two Horizon League tournament championships.\nCincinnati.\nOn April 14, 2019, Brannen was named the new head coach of Cincinnati.\nIn his first season, Brannen lead the Bearcats to a 20–10 record earning a share of the regular season American Athletic Conference title and the 1st overall seed in the conference tournament. However, the season was abruptly ended due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Bearcats were led by Jarron Cumberland and Trevon Scott, playing in a 2019–20 season record seven overtime games over the course of the season.\nWith a new roster and added struggles including a 25-day COVID-19 pause, the Bearcats ended Brannen's second year fifth overall in the regular season with a 12–11 overall record. The team did make a surprise run to the conference tournament championship game before losing to an eventual Final Four team in Houston.\nDismissal.\nWithin two days after the conference tournament championship, the Bearcats saw six players enter the transfer portal. On March 26, the AD John Cunningham announced the university would begin investigating allegations against the program. On April 3, it was announced that Brannen was placed on indefinite leave. On April 9, Cincinnati announced John Brannen had been relieved of his duties effective immediately. On September 8, 2022, it was announced that Brannen and the University of Cincinnati had reached an amicable resolution, later announced to be a $2.75 million settlement.\nReturn to coaching.\nBrannen rejoined Anthony Grant as a program analyst and senior special assistant for Dayton for the 2022–23 season. Brannen left the program after one year.\nPlaying career.\nBrannen played at Newport Central Catholic High School in Newport, Kentucky, followed by a college career at Morehead State before transferring to Marshall for his final two seasons. As a junior, Brannen would play with teammate Jason Williams and was coached by Billy Donovan and then assistant Gregg Marshall. As a senior, Brannen led the Southern Conference in scoring and was named the league tournament MVP. Brannen played two seasons of professional basketball in Belgium's First Division before returning to the States to begin his coaching career.\nPersonal life.\nBrannen is married to the former Lisa Elswick, with whom he has twin daughters. He is originally from Alexandria, Kentucky. He received his bachelor's degree in business management from Marshall University in 1997 and was a Rhodes Scholar finalist as a college senior."

        "text": "Mark McKenzie (born 2 December 1971) is a former Scotland 'A' international Scottish rugby union player. He played for Caledonia Reds and Glasgow Warriors in Scotland, and for CS Bourgoin-Jallieu and Nice in France.\nMcKenzie's career spanned the amateur and professional era. In 1989, he was playing for Glasgow District Under 18s. He won the Division One league title in 94/95 with Stirling County.\nOn Scotland's rugby professionalism in 1996, McKenzie then played for Caledonia Reds and won the Scottish Inter-District Championship with them in the 1996-97 season; their first ever title. He played in the Heineken Cup with Caledonia Reds.\nWhen Caledonia Reds merged with Glasgow Rugby in 1998, to form Glasgow Caledonians, now Glasgow Warriors, McKenzie found himself without a professional club. He was to move to France where he joined CS Bourgoin-Jallieu. He was there from 1998 to 2000.\nHe signed for Glasgow Warriors for the start of the 2000 - 01 season. He made 3 appearances, scoring 129 points from three tries, 24 conversions, 20 penalties and two drop-goals. Competitively, he played 8 matches scoring 97 points. McKenzie made his debut for Glasgow in a friendly playing the Pacific Coast Grizzlies.\nIn late 2000 he asked to leave Glasgow so that he could return to France to be with his girlfriend. He was unable to settle back in Scotland without her. The Glasgow coach Richie Dixon stated: \"Reluctantly, we agreed to let Mark go with effect from the New Year. Obviously we are very sorry to see such a talented player departing but we wish him well in the future.\" The Chief Executive David Jordan said: \"There has been no acrimony over the parting of ways. Mark leaves us on good terms and we genuinely hope his career blossoms again. He is a very potent midfielder and I can see no reason why he should not be continuing to push for Scotland honours in the near future.\"\nStarting 2001, McKenzie secured a two and a half year deal with French side Nice.\nMcKenzie also played in New Zealand.\nMcKenzie came through the ages for Scotland. He played at Scotland U18, Scotland U19 and then Scotland 'A'.\nHe became a SRU Regional Academy coach\nHe played for, then coached Falkirk RFC. He won BT National League Division 4 Player of the Year in 2005 and helped take the Falkirk club back up through the divisions, winning five successive championships. He mentored Finn Russell, Adam Ashe and Grant Gilchrist.\nIn 2012, he was appointed St Aloysius College's new director of rugby. He is also a Sports Performance consultant with ESP."

        "text": "The 2016 South Asian Games, officially the XII South Asian Games, is a major multi-sport event which took place from 5 February to 16 February 2016 in Guwahati and Shillong, India. A total of 2,672 athletes competed in 226 events over 22 sports. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the 2016 South Asian Games in Guwahati on 5 February 2016. India continued its dominance in the game's medal tally with a staggering 308 medals including 188 gold medals.\nHost selection.\nThe games were originally scheduled to be held in 2012 in Kathmandu, but were postponed to Delhi for 2013 but again, were postponed to late 2015 because of the suspension of the Indian Olympic Association. In 2015 it was decided to further postpone the competition to early 2016, because participating countries felt the December dates did not present enough time for preparation.\nLogo, Mascot and Anthem.\nThe Mascot.\nOn 19 December 2015, Tikhor the baby Indian Rhino was unveiled to the public as the official mascot for the 2016 South Asian Games. According to the organising committee, Tikhor carries the message of Peace, Progress, and Prosperity in the South Asian region. This is in line with the official motto, \"Play for Peace, Progress and Prosperity\".\nThe Anthem.\nThe anthem of the games was chosen to be a famous Assamese song, \"Ei Prithibi Ek Krirangan\" (The world is a playground) by Bhupen Hazarika, an Indian lyricist, musician, singer, poet and film-maker from Assam.\nThe Games.\nSports.\nThere are 228 events in 23 sports scheduled to be held. A total of 764 medals (228 gold, 228 silver and 308 bronze medals) are on offer in 2016 South Asian Games.\nParticipating nations.\n8 countries competed in 2016 South Asian Games.\nMedal tally.\n\"After Doping Test Result.\"\nCalendar.\nCompetition scheduled accurate as of 5 February 2016.\nControversy.\nIOA ban and delay.\nInitially, the Games were expected to be held in October, 2012. However, during the General Body meeting of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) on 16 December 2011, it was decided to postpone the Games to February, 2013. The primary concern highlighted was that the original plan meant that the Games would be held only two months after the 2012 Summer Olympics, a fact which made athletes uncomfortable. In addition, the Delhi Government had stated that \"accommodation would be a problem during October–November\". In April 2012, the IOA sent letters to all the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of South Asia, announcing that the Games will be held for eight days beginning from 13 February 2013; further discussions would take place at an all-NOC meeting in Moscow. President of the Nepal Olympic Committee Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan also reported about the proposed additions of fencing, equestrian, gymnastics and the triathlon to the Games schedule. As of January 2013, host city and dates of the games were not yet confirmed.\nThe International Olympic Committee banned the Indian Committee in March for political interference (the national government played a role in Olympic officials' selection). This delayed the event further as the ban was only lifted in May and the possibility of a low-cost edition of the games was raised among ongoing hosting discussions and poor relations with neighboring Pakistan due to the 2013 India–Pakistan border incidents.\n2 years later, on 11 February 2014, the International Olympic Committee decided to lift the ban. Up until now, the Indian side competed in Olympic events such as the Winter Olympic Games as independent participants.\nA year later, on 5 June 2015, the uncertainty over the venue to host the 12th South Asian Games ended with the Sports Ministry and Indian Olympic Association deciding to hold the regional multi-sporting event in Guwahati and Shillong in November–December 2015. However, this was postponed even further to a tentative date of February 2016.\nULFA anti-talks faction also pledged support to South Asian Games, which is opposite to its stand on 2007 National Games of India held in Guwahati.\nOn 3 February 2016, International Basketball Federation (FIBA) stated that it will not recognise the competition because of \"unacceptable interference by Indian Olympic Association in affairs of the Basketball Federation of India\".\nPakistani women's volleyball team is returning to South Asian Games after two decades - for the first time after their participation in 1995 South Asian Games, Madras where they had finished with a bronze medal. Afghanistan and Pakistan basketball teams will not participate. Union Home ministry had sanctioned to the police authorities to upgrade their security apparatus for the South Asian Games.\nIndia granted special concession to Pakistani athletes taking part in the 12th South Asian Games by declaring Guwahati and Kolkata as designated entry points for them.\nFurther political interference.\nInitially, the Basketball event was scheduled to take place in 11 February, however FIBA, Basketball's world governing body, decided to de-recognise the tournament on the grounds of political interference from the Indian Government and the Indian Olympic Association. This resulted in the entire event being cancelled, so rather having 228 events in 23 sports, the competition change to 226 events in 22 sports causing further scrutiny over the organization of the games.\nDoping at the 2016 South Asian Games.\nOn February 7, 2016 after completion of squash event, Nasir Iqbal was asked to give his sample by World Anti Doping Agency (WADA). First Sample was tested positive and later after 3 days another test got the result as negative. Although he challenged, after significant evaluation WADA decided to dismiss his appeal and banned him for 4 years, from February 19, 2016, to February 19, 2020.\nNasir Iqbal was also stripped off from the Squash Men's Singles Gold-medalist Title."

The tour coincided with the 2016 Caribbean Premier League. This was the first bilateral tour between the two sides since the West Indies pulled out of the previous tour in October 2014.\nIn July 2016 the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) met with West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to look at the possibility of adding three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches to the tour. The WICB requested that the matches could be played at the Central Broward Regional Park in Florida at the end of August. The West Indies previously played T20I matches in the United States against New Zealand in June 2012. There were fears that it may have taken up to six weeks to secure visas for the Indian team, but both the BCCI and WICB secured them in time. On 2 August, the BCCI confirmed that there would be two T20I matches played in Florida at the end of August.\nIndia won the Test series 2–0 and the West Indies won the T20I series 1–0."

        "text": "The English cricket team toured Bangladesh in October 2016 to play three One Day Internationals (ODIs), two Test matches and three tour matches. A terrorist attack in Dhaka four months before the tour started raised concerns about team safety. This led to two members of the England team, regular one-day captain Eoin Morgan and opener Alex Hales, to withdraw from selection.\nEngland won the ODI series 2–1. The Test series finished 1–1, with Bangladesh recording their first ever Test win against England when they won the second Test by 108 runs. The Bangladesh captain, Mushfiqur Rahim, said that \"it's a great moment for Bangladesh cricket\". In response to the defeat England captain Alastair Cook said \"it's not easy for me to say, but it's a good win for Bangladesh cricket\".\nSecurity concerns.\nFollowing a terrorist attack in Dhaka in July 2016, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said it would follow advice from the Bangladesh government on the forthcoming tour. In response the president of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), Nazmul Hassan, said that \"England are coming after three months, by which time the situation in Bangladesh will get better\". England's limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan said there were \"big concerns\" regarding the security of the England team following the attack. The BCB later rejected any plans to the matches at a neutral venue, should England pull out of the tour to Bangladesh. Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza said he was \"hopeful\" that the tour would go ahead. Zimbabwean Richard Halsall, Bangladesh's fielding coach, said that he feels safe working in Bangladesh and is hopeful of England's arrival.\nIn August the ECB sent a delegation to do a security inspection of venues in Mirpur, Chittagong and Fatullah. Following the inspection, the ECB confirmed that the tour would go ahead as planned. Following the confirmation that the tour would go ahead, England's director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, said that it is 100% safe to tour Bangladesh. Nazmul Hassan, the BCB president, said that the BCB would provide security for player's family members, journalists and travelling England fans.\nSome England players talked about safety evaluations before confirming their participation but Moeen Ali was the first England player to confirm he would go to Bangladesh, saying \"If selected, I'll definitely go\". Andrew Strauss gave a deadline of 10 September 2016 for players to confirm their commitment to the tour and on 11 September the ECB announced that Alex Hales and Morgan both declined to tour. The England supporters' group, the Barmy Army, said there was \"too much risk\" for fans to travel to Bangladesh and later confirmed they would not be following the tour.\nJos Buttler was appointed captain of the ODI side in Morgan's absence. Buttler said that Morgan remains \"very much the captain\" and his choice not to tour Bangladesh \"won't divide the dressing room\". Morgan returned to his role of ODI captain when England tour India in November. Ahead of the ODI series, the Bangladesh Army ran a security drill to evacuate players.\nSquads.\nJames Anderson and Mark Wood withdrew from the England squads before the tour started due to injury. Jake Ball was added to the Test squad and Steven Finn to the ODI squad to replace them. Taijul Islam was added to Bangladesh's squad for the third ODI as a replacement for Mosharraf Hossain. Subashis Roy and Mosaddek Hossain were added to Bangladesh's squad for the second Test. Hossain was a backup to Sabbir Rahman while Shafiul Islam was rested. However, a few days later the Bangladesh team announced that Sabbir Rahman would be fit for the second Test."

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed the dates of the tour in July 2016. India last hosted a five-Test series in 1986–87 against Pakistan.\nIndia agreed to use the Decision Review System (DRS) for this series against England on trial basis to evaluate the improvements made in the system. This was the first time since 2008 that there was a bilateral series involving India with all the components of the review system in place, including \"Ultra Edge\". However, Hot Spot was not amongst the tools available to be used. DRS was used in the ODI series between the two teams.\nThe Test series was played for Anthony De Mello Trophy, with India winning the 5-match series 4–0. During the fifth Test of the series, India made their highest total ever in Test cricket, scoring 759 runs for 7 wickets before declaring their innings. India's victory in the fifth Test broke their record for consecutive Tests without defeat, taking their total to eighteen unbeaten matches. They also finished the year with nine Test victories, the most ever for India.\nPrior to the naming of the squads for the ODI and T20I matches, MS Dhoni announced that he was standing down as India's limited-overs captain. Virat Kohli was appointed as captain for the ODI and T20I fixtures. Dhoni played in what was planned to be his final match as captain of an Indian team in the first 50-over tour match against England XI on 10 January 2017. However, he would return to the captaincy in September 2018, during the 2018 Asia Cup.\nThe ODI series was a high scoring series with an aggregate of 2,090 runs being scored, which was the highest number of runs in a series of three or fewer matches. All the innings in the series recorded a score of more than 300. India won the ODI series 2–1 and the T20I series by the same margin. It was the first time that India had won a T20I bilateral series against England.\nSquads.\nJames Anderson was added to England's squad after recovering from injury. KL Rahul was added to India's squad for the second Test. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was added to India's squad for the last three Tests, while Gautam Gambhir was dropped. Due to thigh strain Wriddhiman Saha missed the third Test. Parthiv Patel was called up as his replacement. KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya got injured while training in the nets at the PCA Stadium. Pandya was released from the squad, however, Rahul was expected to be fit for the fourth Test. England's Haseeb Hameed injured his hand in the third Test and went home to undergo surgery on it. Keaton Jennings was named as Hameed's replacement and Liam Dawson replaced Zafar Ansari, who injured his back. Ishant Sharma was released from the squad for the fourth Test for his wedding and rejoined the squad for the last Test. Saha also missed the last two Tests as he had not recovered fully from injury. Ajinkya Rahane missed the final two Tests of the series due to a finger injury. He was replaced by Manish Pandey. Shardul Thakur was added to India's squad as cover for Mohammed Shami who had a sore knee. Alex Hales was ruled out of the remaining limited-overs fixtures after he fractured his hand during the second ODI. Jonny Bairstow was named as Hales' replacement for the T20I fixtures. Ahead of the T20I series, India rested Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, replacing them with Amit Mishra and Parvez Rasool."

        "text": "Justin Bailey (born June 10, 1977) is an American basketball coach and former player. He played college basketball for Hartford before playing overseas for 13 years as a professional in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Kazakhstan and Russia.\nHigh school career.\nBailey was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey and grew up in nearby Piscataway, where he attended Piscataway Township High School, leading the school's basketball team to a 23–2 record and a Group IV state championship as a junior in 1993–94.\nCollege career.\nBailey began his college career in 1995–96, joining the Hartford Hawks as a freshman. He averaged 12.1 points and 3.2 rebounds in 28 games in his first season, earning himself North Atlantic Conference All-Rookie Team honors.\nAs a sophomore playing for the Hawks in 1996–97, Bailey was considered the team's super-sub after a preseason ankle injury moved him to the bench. In 28 games on the season, Bailey averaged 12.9 points and 3.3 rebounds per game.\nAs a junior in 1997–98, Bailey earned first-team All-North Atlantic Conference honors after averaging 20.1 points and 5.0 rebounds in 27 games.

        "title": "Cheyenne Indians (baseball)",
        "text": "The Cheyenne Indians were a minor league baseball team based in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The 1912 Cheyenne \"Indians\" played briefly as members of the Class D level Rocky Mountain League, with the team winning the league championship in the league's only season. The Indians next played the 1941 season as members of the Class D level Western League, qualifying for the playoffs in their only season of play. Cheyenne hosted home games at Pioneer Park in both seasons of minor league play.\nHistory.\nThe Cheyenne \"Indians\" moniker was first used by early amateur and semi–professional teams in Cheyenne, along with other monikers such as the Bachelors, Benedicts, Black Stockings, Eclipse and Nonpareils. However, the Indians moniker would be used for decades by Cheyenne amateur and semi–professional teams.\nIn 1912, Cheyenne first hosted minor league baseball and won a league championship. The Cheyenne Indians became charter members of the short–lived Rocky Mountain League during the season. The Rocky Mountain League began their first season of play on May 6, 1912, as a four-team league, with the Canon City Swastikas, Colorado Springs Millionaires, La Junta Railroaders and Pueblo Indians teams as members to begin the season.\nThe Rocky Mountain League had evolved from a semi–professional league and formed as a minor league for the 1912 season. On June 8, 1912, playing in the four–team 1912 league, the Pueblo Indians team relocated to Trinidad, Colorado. On June 28, 1912, the franchise subsequently moved from Trinidad to Cheyenne, becoming the Cheyenne Indians. On July 5, 1912, the Rocky Mountain League folded before completing the season. On that date, the Pueblo/Trinidad/Cheyenne franchise was in first place with a 22–7 record, 2.5 games ahead of the second place Raton, New Mexico team when the league folded. The Pueblo/Trinidad/Cheyenne team played the season under managers John Galena and Ira Bidwell in winning the shortened season championship. The 1912 Indians played home games at Pioneer Park while based in Cheyenne. \nAfter the Rocky Mountain League folded, the 1912 Cheyenne Indians continued unofficial play against teams from Fort D.A. Russell and Nebraska.\nIn 1941, minor league baseball returned to Cheyanne, as the \"Indians\" team was reestablished and became members of the Western League, playing home games again at Pioneer Park. The addition of Cheyenne and the Denver Bears allowed the league to expand from four–teams to six–teams in 1941. The teams joined Cheyenne in beginning league play on May 6, 1941\nCheyenne ended the 1941 season in second place in the Western League standings. With a 59–44 record under Manager John Kerr, in the regular season standings, Cheyenne finished 2.0 games behind the first place Norfolk Yankees. Cheyenne finished ahead of the Sioux City Cowboys (54–56), Pueblo Rollers (52–54), Sioux Falls Canaries (51–56) and Denver Bears (42–68) teams and qualified for the four team playoffs. In the first round of Western League playoffs, the Pueblo Rollers defeated Cheyenne 3 games to 2. The Western League ceased play after the 1941 season due to World War II. Mel Bergman of Cheyenne led the Western League with 10 home runs, while teammate George Milstead had a league leading 19 wins.\nAfter the conclusion of World War II, the Western League reformed in 1947 without a Cheyenne franchise. The 1941 Indians were the last minor league team hosted in Cheyenne.\nThe ballpark.\nThe Cheyenne Indians hosted minor league home games at Pioneer Park in both seasons. Originally built in 1896 with rodeo stands, Pioneer Park had a capacity of 2,000. The 1941 Cheyenne Indians season tickets cost $20 and single game tickets were 40 cents, with single game tickets for soldiers costing 25 cents. Pioneer Park is still in use as a public park, hosting a ballpark today. Pioneer Park is located at 1331 Talbot Court in Cheyenne, Wyoming."

        "title": "2016 Monaco Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2016 Monaco Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2016) was a Formula One motor race held on 29 May 2016 at the Circuit de Monaco, a street circuit that runs through the Principality of Monaco. It was the sixth round of the 2016 FIA Formula One World Championship, and marked the seventy-fourth time that the Monaco Grand Prix had been held, as well as the sixty-third time it had been held as a round of the Formula One World Championship since the series inception in .\nNico Rosberg was the defending race winner having won the past three Monaco Grands Prix in a row and entered the race with a thirty-nine-point lead held over Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen in the Drivers' Championship. Rosberg's team, Mercedes, held a 48-point lead over Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship.\nDuring Saturday's qualifying, Daniel Ricciardo, who was driving for Red Bull Racing, achieved the first pole position of his career. In an eventful race, Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton took victory ahead of Ricciardo, who had lost time during a pitstop, when his engineers made a last second strategy call to swap to a different set of tyres while mechanics were already in the pit lane; as a result, the tyres arrived late to the car. Sergio Pérez completed the podium for Force India, the team's first appearance in the top three of the season and their first since the 2015 Russian Grand Prix.\nBackground.\nFollowing their controversial crash and double retirement at the previous race in Spain two weeks earlier, particular attention was on championship leaders Mercedes and their drivers Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton. The team was adamant that such an incident could not be repeated, with their head of motorsport Toto Wolff saying: \"We cannot afford to drop the ball, so we must remain united, remain strong and hit back hard this weekend.\" With a win, Rosberg would have been able to become the only driver other than Ayrton Senna to win the Monaco Grand Prix four times in a row, while Hamilton had suffered a string of bad results at the circuit, having won only once in 2008. At the race the year before, Hamilton had lost what he felt was a certain victory by a wrong decision to pit him during a safety car period.\nFernando Alonso received a new, revised combustion engine for his car, his third of five allowed over the course of the season without receiving a grid penalty. Power unit supplier Honda stressed that they had not used any development tokens, a set of limited allowed changes to the units, but had instead only improved reliability. The team also equipped both cars with new batteries and electronics control units, set to improve the reliability of the cars as well. During the two-day testing session that took place after the previous Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Renault introduced an updated version of their power unit, which was used during the test to the satisfaction of driver Kevin Magnussen, who declared that the new unit was a step forward in both power and driveability. He urged the team to pull the introduction of the power unit forward to the Monaco race, instead of the following Grand Prix in Canada as originally planned. Renault chose to do so, however, they were only able to hand out one updated unit to both their works team and Red Bull, who used them under the name TAG Heuer. The two units were eventually given to Magnussen at Renault and Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull.\nThe race saw the competitive début of Pirelli's new ultrasoft tyre compound, which was provided alongside the supersoft and soft compounds. Per the regulations of the season, every driver needs to set aside one set each of the two softest compounds for the race and one set of the ultrasofts for Q3 (should they advance). The drivers have freedom of what other compounds they choose for the remaining ten out of thirteen sets. From this race onwards, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile allowed drivers to choose alternative helmet designs for one race weekend per season, a practice usually prohibited as they have to wear the same design to make them more recognisable to spectators and television audiences. As a consequence, Felipe Massa's helmet featured extensive artwork by graffiti artist Os Gêmeos, teammate Valtteri Bottas featured casino-inspired imagery and Haas driver Romain Grosjean sported a tribute to the late Jules Bianchi on his helmet. The race marked a reason for celebration at McLaren, as the team had started their first ever Grand Prix at Monaco fifty years earlier.\nGoing into the weekend, Nico Rosberg led the Drivers' Championship with 100 points, followed by Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen with 61 points. Lewis Hamilton followed in third, a further four points behind, with Sebastian Vettel in fourth with 48 points, level with Daniel Ricciardo in fifth. In the constructors' standings, Mercedes led with 157 points, 48 points ahead of Ferrari, with Red Bull Racing in third with 94 points.\nFree practice.\nPer the regulations for the 2016 season, two ninety-minute practice and one sixty-minute session were held before qualifying on Saturday. The first two usually take place on Friday, with Monaco being the single exemption, where those sessions are held on Thursday, in order to minimise road-closure disruptions to local residents. In the first session on Thursday morning, Lewis Hamilton topped the timesheets with a time of 1:15.537, one tenth of a second faster than his teammate Nico Rosberg. They were followed by Sebastian Vettel, almost half a second down on Hamilton, and the two Red Bull cars of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen respectively. Daniil Kvyat, driving for Toro Rosso, in sixth was the last driver to get within a second of Hamilton's time. He was the only one of the front runners to set his time on the supersoft instead of the faster ultrasoft tyres. There were several incidents during the session: After twenty-four minutes, Felipe Massa hit the barrier in turn one, damaging his car and leading to a virtual safety car (VSC) period. Later, Lewis Hamilton had a brake lockup at the same spot, but was able to get into the run-off area without touching the guardrail. Several other drivers had dangerous moments in turn one as well, but the most severe incident of the session came three minutes to the end: A drain cover had come loose around the first corner, puncturing Rosberg's left rear tyre and damaging Jenson Button's McLaren MP4-31, causing the practice to be red flagged, ultimately ending the session.\nIn second practice on Thursday afternoon, Ricciardo was fastest, setting a time of 1:14.607, more than half a second clear of Hamilton in second place. Rosberg and Verstappen, in third and fourth, were the only other drivers to get within a second of Ricciardo, while the two Williams drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa struggled, ending the session 14th and 16th respectively. At Ferrari, Kimi Räikkönen was fastest in seventh spot. His teammate, Vettel, had an incident-packed session that eventually ended with him setting the ninth fastest time. He spun at Mirabeau corner, damaging his rear wing, only to hit the wall in turn one after coming back to the track, albeit continuing with wheel rim damage. A VSC period occurred after Romain Grosjean crashed into the outside barrier at the exit of the tunnel. Two more VSC periods ensued when Rio Haryanto touched the inside barrier at the same spot and later after Kevin Magnussen crashed at the final corner.\nIn the third practice session on Saturday morning, Sebastian Vettel set the fastest time, about one hundredth of a second faster than Hamilton. Nico Rosberg and Daniel Ricciardo followed, both also within two tenth of a second of Vettel. Max Verstappen was fifth fastest although he had a minor crash coming up to Casino square, clipping the wall. Toro Rosso were again quick, getting both drivers into the top ten. Renault had different fortunes, as both drivers had accidents, with Jolyon Palmer hindering one of Hamilton's flying laps as he crashed at the swimming pool section.\nQualifying.\nQualifying consisted of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions. In the first part of qualifying (Q1), the session got interrupted shortly after it had started, as Felipe Nasr came to a halt at the exit of the tunnel, caused by an engine failure. A red flag came out while the car was cleared off the track. When the running resumed, all drivers except for the two at Force India went out on the ultrasoft tyres to set their first lap times. Max Verstappen was the last to set a representative time, but touched the guardrail at the swimming pool chicane and crashed into the wall, causing another red flag period. As the session got back under way, it were the two Manor cars of Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein, as well as Jolyon Palmer and Marcus Ericsson who joined Nasr and Verstappen on the sidelines, as they were eliminated. Kevin Magnussen meanwhile barely made it into Q2, but was under investigation for exiting the pit lane while it was closed.\nIn the second part, Lewis Hamilton quickly set a fast lap time, the quickest of the weekend up to that point, about half a second ahead of his teammate Rosberg. Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo set his fastest lap on the harder supersoft compound tyre, meaning that he would be able to start the race on them, should it have stayed dry. On the back end, Williams struggled for pace and both Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa missed out on Q3 by qualifying 11th and 14th respectively. Also eliminated were Esteban Gutiérrez, Jenson Button, Romain Grosjean and Magnussen.\nAs Q3 started, Lewis Hamilton stopped in the pit lane with a loss of power and was pushed back into the garage. He was eventually able to go on track and qualified third, after starting several quick laps only to abandon them to leave his final run to the last moment. He was however beaten to pole position by Ricciardo, who was almost two-tenths of a second faster than second placed Rosberg, with Vettel following in fourth almost a second slower. Nico Hülkenberg managed fifth ahead of Kimi Räikkönen, who was to serve a five-place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, leaving him eleventh on the grid. Carlos Sainz Jr., Sergio Pérez, Daniil Kvyat and Fernando Alonso rounded up the top ten. Ricciardo's pole position was the first for a Renault-powered turbocharged car since Ayrton Senna's front-of-the-grid start at the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix for Lotus.\nPost-qualifying.\nAfter qualifying, the race stewards decided not to give a penalty to Magnussen for ignoring the red light at the end of the pit lane during Q1, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity was the result of an impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.\nRace.\nWith rain shortly before the race, the start was taken behind the safety car, forcing all drivers to start the race on the full wet tyres. As Ricciardo led the field behind the safety car, Daniil Kvyat had to come into the pit lane on lap two, complaining of technical issues. He rejoined with a new steering wheel, being a lap down on the rest of the pack already. The race started in earnest on lap seven, with Ricciardo defending his lead at the restart. Kevin Magnussen made a pit stop for intermediate tyres at the end of the lap, but his teammate Jolyon Palmer proved just how slippery it still was when he crashed out just a lap later, being caught out by a wet zebra crossing and causing a virtual safety car period. More cars came into the pitlane for intermediate tyres over the following laps. On lap eleven, Kimi Räikkönen damaged his front wing on the guardrail at the Loews hairpin, resulting in his front wing getting caught under his front tyres, blocking Grosjean's way in the process. Räikkönen retired some corners later. Meanwhile, Ricciardo built a gap at the front, being ten seconds clear of Rosberg on lap 13. One lap later, Sebastian Vettel was the first of the front runners to change to intermediate tyres. Mercedes issued team orders demanding Rosberg let Hamilton past on lap 16, but the gap had by then grown to 13 seconds.\nOn lap 21, Rosberg made a pit stop for the intermediate tyres, leaving only Ricciardo and Hamilton at the front of the field on the full wet tyres. Ricciardo made the switch on lap 24, but Hamilton stayed out, opting to remain on the wet tyre until the track dried out enough to go straight to slicks. In the meantime, Verstappen had fought his way back into the top ten, after having started 21st. In the subsequent laps, Ricciardo was able to reduce the gap to Hamilton in the lead, producing fastest laps on inters, edging as close as half a second by lap 28. Behind the leading pair, Rosberg was third ahead of Pérez and Vettel. The pivotal moment of the race followed on lap 31, when Hamilton changed to slick tyres. When Ricciardo followed suit a lap later, his pit crew was in position to equip a set of slick tyres. However, a last-second change of mind by his engineers to not equip slicks led to a long stop, as crews scrambled to fetch the proper tyres. Hamilton managed to capitalise on Ricciardo's long stop, and held him off for the remainder of the race. Sergio Pérez was another driver who benefited during the second round of stops, emerging in third. Rosberg was left in sixth after both Vettel and Alonso also came out ahead of him after the switch to dry tyres. On lap 34, Ricciardo made an attempt to repass Hamilton on track, but Hamilton successfully defended his position.\nAnother virtual safety car period ensued on lap 35, caused by Verstappen who crashed his car into the barrier after locking up his tyres. As the VSC ended on lap 37, Ricciardo once more failed in an attempt to regain the lead. At the chicane coming out of the tunnel, Hamilton misjudged the corner and backed Ricciardo off at the exit of the chicane, causing the latter to complain about the move on team radio. While the incident was investigated by the stewards, the decision was not to take action against Hamilton. At that point, the order stood as follows: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Pérez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutiérrez. The top four drivers pulled away cleanly from the rest of the field behind them. On lap 50, the two Sauber cars collided at Rascasse corner, after Felipe Nasr had ignored instructions from the pit lane to let his teammate Ericsson behind him pass. Another VSC period was called while both Sauber drivers made pit stops to repair damages, only for both to retire some laps later. In front, the race carried on in the same order. On lap 68, the fourth virtual safety car period occurred when a large plastic sheet fell onto the start–finish straight. Hamilton was able to extend his lead over Ricciardo at that point, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 71. Three laps from the finish, rain started to fall again, although no driver changed tyres before the chequered flag fell. Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory ahead of Ricciardo and Pérez. This win for Hamilton marked his second at Monaco, the other being in 2008. Vettel hung on to fourth, followed by Alonso in fifth. Rosberg lost his sixth place to Nico Hülkenberg on the very last lap.\nPost-race.\nAt the podium interviews, conducted by former Formula One driver Martin Brundle, Hamilton thanked his team and expressed satisfaction about how the race went. He pointed to the problems of driving on the full wet tyres for such a long distance, saying that they were about to \"drop off\", meaning to lose much of their grip to the race surface, when he came in to change. He complimented Ricciardo on driving \"phenomenally all weekend\". Ricciardo himself lamented his misfortune in losing the race during his second pit stop. In regard to his team's error and their different strategy at the previous race in Spain, which he felt had cost him a chance at victory there as well, he said: \"Two weekends in a row I've been screwed now. It sucks. It hurts.\" He emphasised that it had not been his decision to pit at that time, but that the team had called him in and criticised them for not being ready when he arrived. Sergio Pérez on the other hand was \"extremely happy\" with the performance by him and the team, saying that the race was his favourite podium finish while driving for Force India.\nSpeaking about the moment when Nico Rosberg let him past in the early stages of the race, Hamilton told the press that he had thanked his teammate for \"being a gentleman\". When asked how painful it had been to be asked to let Hamilton go by, Rosberg said: \"It was more painful the feeling that I had in the car. That was the worst. Around Monaco, that's not a nice feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. The second thing [team order] was just a consequence of that.\" Mercedes's motorsport director Toto Wolff also praised Rosberg for working for the team and moving to the side without questioning the team's decision. Rosberg was however unable to give an explanation for his slow pace during the early stages. He pointed to the possibility that his car's tyre and brake temperatures had been particularly affected by the period behind the safety car.\nFollowing their intra-team collision, Sauber's team principal Monisha Kaltenborn put blame on both drivers. The stewards penalised Ericsson for the incident, handing him a three-place grid penalty for the following race in Canada as well as three penalty points to his licence. Felipe Nasr was adamant that the team orders he had received prior to the accident had been uncalled for, since his slower pace was due to low tyre temperatures. He also claimed that Ericsson had ignored team orders himself on two occasions in the previous season. Ericsson in turn had a different view and said that the team had told him for \"seven or eight laps\" that they would swap the positions of the drivers before he decided to go for the pass himself. Valtteri Bottas and Pascal Wehrlein also received penalties during and after the race. Bottas was handed a ten-second time penalty and two penalty points on his licence for causing a collision with Gutiérrez, while Wehrlein received two separate ten-second penalties: the first for exceeding the allowed lap time under VSC conditions and the second for ignoring blue flags. He was also given two penalty points each for both incidents.\nFollowing the Grand Prix, Nico Rosberg retained first place in the Drivers' Championship with 106 points, but his lead over the second-placed driver, now Hamilton, had decreased to 24 points. Daniel Ricciardo moved up to third with 66 points, five points ahead of Räikkönen. In the Constructors' standings, Mercedes extended their lead over Ferrari to 67 points, with Red Bull in third another nine points behind."

        "text": "The 2016 British Grand Prix (formally known as the 2016 Formula 1 British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 10 July 2016 at the Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, United Kingdom. This race was the seventy-first running of the British Grand Prix, the first having been held in 1926, and was the tenth round of the 2016 FIA Formula One World Championship and the fiftieth time that the race was held at the Silverstone Circuit since the Formula One series inception in .\nMercedes driver Nico Rosberg entered the round with an eleven-point lead over teammate Lewis Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship. Mercedes held a 103-points advantage over Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship. During Saturday's qualifying session, Hamilton achieved the 55th pole position of his career to start from the front of the grid, ahead of Rosberg and Max Verstappen.\nThe race began behind the safety car due to rain shortly before the start. Hamilton was able to convert his pole position into a third straight victory at the British Grand Prix, leading home Rosberg and Verstappen in changing conditions. Rosberg came under investigation by the race stewards after he received detailed instructions by his team how to work around a gearbox problem in the closing laps of the race, a practice forbidden under Formula One regulations. He was later handed a ten-second time penalty, demoting him to third place. The result saw Rosberg's championship lead reduced to just a single point over Hamilton.\nReport.\nBackground.\nGoing into the weekend, Nico Rosberg was leading the Drivers' Championship with 153 points, eleven ahead of his teammate Lewis Hamilton. Ferrari drivers Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen were third and fourth respectively, with 96 points each, ahead of Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo with 88. In the Constructors' Championship standings, Mercedes was in front with 295 points, 103 ahead of Ferrari, with Red Bull Racing following in third with 168 points.\nFollowing the collision between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg on the last lap of the Austrian Grand Prix, the second major collision between the two in five races, Mercedes introduced a new driver management policy, dictating the terms by which Hamilton and Rosberg could race one another and promising penalties in the event of further on-track altercations.\nTyre supplier Pirelli provided teams with the hard, medium and soft compounds of tyre—the three hardest compounds available—for the race. Just as the year before, the race stewards warned drivers about exceeding the track limits around the circuit, stressing that lap times during qualifying would be disallowed should drivers not stay within the lines indicating the track borders.\nThe second mid-season test of the year was scheduled to be held at the circuit following the race. Santino Ferrucci and Nikita Mazepin made their first appearances for Haas and Force India respectively, while Pierre Gasly drove for Red Bull Racing and Charles Leclerc for Ferrari. After missing the first test in Spain, Sauber once again skipped the post-race test. The reason behind this decision was stated as to \"consider cost effectiveness\", as the team did not have any new components to introduce. Sauber did however introduce their first updates of the season to their car during free practice at the event, with Marcus Ericsson doing a trial run with a new rear wing. Further aerodynamic updates that the team had announced the week before did not arrive in time for Silverstone. Sauber did however receive the benefit of Ferrari's updated version of their power unit, used by the works team since the Canadian Grand Prix. Haas was able to use the upgraded units as well. McLaren used an updated version of their Honda power unit as well, with two tokens – changes allowed to the units – applied to the combustion engine.\nFree practice.\nPer the regulations for the season, two 90-minute practice sessions were held on Friday and another 60-minute session was held before qualifying on Saturday. Lewis Hamilton was fastest in the first practice session on Friday morning, setting a time of 1:31.654, less than a tenth of a second ahead of teammate Nico Rosberg. After setting their fast times, the Mercedes drivers went on to complete long stints to test race performance on the harder tyre compounds. Nico Hülkenberg and Sebastian Vettel in third and fourth were the only drivers to set a time within one second of the Mercedes. Charles Leclerc had his first practice outing with Haas, taking over the car usually run by Esteban Gutiérrez. He was a tenth of a second faster than the other test driver, Esteban Ocon, who took over Kevin Magnussen's Renault RS16. Vettel did a test with an updated version of Ferrari's \"halo\"-system designed to improve the protection of the driver's head inside the cockpit. He described the device as \"not great\", lamenting that it had \"quite a bit of impact on visibility\".\nHamilton was again fastest in the second practice on Friday afternoon, while Rosberg was unable to partake due to a water leak on his car. Hamilton's time of 1:31.660 was over three-tenths of a second faster than that of second places Daniel Ricciardo. Fellow Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was third, ahead of Vettel, all within one second of the fastest time. Ferrari split their practice strategy, with Kimi Räikkönen running the hard-compound tyre early in the session, while Vettel used the softer medium compound, before both switched to the soft tyres. At their home race, McLaren had a mixed session. While Fernando Alonso placed a good sixth, teammate Jenson Button had to take to the garage for repairs twice, before coming out on track again late in the session, eventually setting the ninth fastest time. Daniil Kvyat was 13th fastest, but damaged his front wing when he went over a kerb at Club corner.\nLewis Hamilton made it a clean sweep of fastest times in practice on Saturday morning, setting a time of 1:30.904, again less than a tenth of a second ahead of Rosberg. The session started in wet conditions following a rain shower thirty minutes before it commenced. It was interrupted with 22 minutes to go, after Marcus Ericsson crashed heavily at the exit of Stowe corner. With the car cleared from the track, lengthy repair work at the barriers followed, leaving just five minutes of running when practice was restarted. The drivers then set their fastest times of the session. Again, it were the Red Bull drivers closest to the Mercedes, with Ricciardo ahead of Verstappen in third, both about half a second off Hamilton's time. Ericsson was sent to hospital for tests following his accident and received a five-place grid penalty since his gearbox had to be changed. Vettel received the same penalty after his gearbox failed towards the end of the third practice session.\nQualifying.\nQualifying consisted of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions. Following his crash, Ericsson did not take part in qualifying and was therefore automatically eliminated, leaving five drivers in danger of not going through into the second session. In the first part of qualifying (Q1), several drivers were investigated for exceeding track limits emerged. Jenson Button ended the session 17th due to a damaged rear wing, a disappointment after having started third a week before in Austria. Also eliminated were the other Sauber driver Felipe Nasr, both Manor cars and Jolyon Palmer.\nLewis Hamilton set the pace in Q2, seven-tenths of a second ahead of Rosberg. Kimi Räikkönen was in danger of being eliminated for the majority of the session, as he spun while preparing for his first timed lap and then ran wide over the track limits on his second attempt, but managed to proceed into Q3 with his third fast lap. He initially demoted Fernando Alonso outside the top ten with his time, but the McLaren driver hit back with a time sufficient to move on. This left Magnussen, Daniil Kvyat, Gutiérrez, Romain Grosjean, Felipe Massa, and Sergio Pérez on the sidelines for Q3.\nOn his first timed run in Q3, Hamilton failed to improve on his lap time from Q2, but was still well ahead of his teammate. However, his time was disallowed for not respecting track limits, meaning that he had to set another fast lap. Even though he slowed down in the middle sector of the lap to avoid making the same mistake again, he recorded a time just short of his earlier effort to achieve the 55th pole position of his career. Verstappen slotted into third on the grid, almost a second down on Hamilton, with his teammate Ricciardo next to him in fourth. The Red Bull pair was followed by the Ferrari cars of Räikkönen and Vettel, though Vettel's grid penalty meant that he would start 11th. Carlos Sainz Jr. was eighth on the grid ahead of Hülkenberg and Alonso. Both had originally set times faster than Sainz's, but those were disallowed due to them exceeding the track limits. Following qualifying, the paddock was split in its opinion over the strict interpretation of the track limit rules. Hamilton and Hülkenberg, who both fell victim to erased lap times, supported the stewards' decision, as did Jenson Button. However, Jolyon Palmer was angered by what he called \"a mess\" and \"rubbish for the fans\", saying that having times changed after the end of the session, as it happened in Hülkenberg's case, was \"confusing for fans and less enjoyable\".\nRace.\nDue to rain shortly before the start of the race, it commenced behind the safety car, with every car equipped with full wet tyres. The safety car came back into the pitlane at the end of lap five and racing began properly. While the top four drivers stayed out, several behind chose to make a pitstop for intermediate tyres. Just one lap later, Pascal Wehrlein became the first casualty of the still damp track, sliding off the track and getting stuck in the gravel, leading to a brief virtual safety car period. During this time, both Hamilton and Rosberg changed tyres. The biggest winner of the first few laps was Sergio Pérez, who had worked up his way from tenth on the grid to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo. Meanwhile, at the front, Hamilton had established a five-second advantage over Rosberg, who soon came under attack by Verstappen, who was running well on the intermediate tyres. Bottas came into a spin on lap 11, losing positions and dropping back to 13th place. On lap 16, Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to make the switch to slick tyres, while Verstappen moved ahead of Rosberg into second position.\nLap 18 saw more drivers making the change to slick tyres, including Räikkönen and Palmer, but the latter was let go from his pitbox before one of the tyres was properly fitted, costing him time and handing him a ten-second stop-and-go penalty. Both Mercedes drivers and Verstappen made their second pitstops by lap 20, with the order remaining the same. On lap 21, Ricciardo moved ahead of Pérez into fourth position. A mistake by Räikkönen two laps later saw him lose sixth place to Sainz. Fernando Alonso spun on lap 25, but was able to continue, unlike Rio Haryanto, who retired following a spin one lap later. Hamilton retained the lead, but not without problems, as he also had a short excursion off the track, which was mirrored by Verstappen behind him. As a result, the top three moved closer together. Vettel was still running at the back end of the point-scoring positions, overtaking Kvyat for ninth on lap 29.\nNico Rosberg started to close on Verstappen for second place, starting overtaking attempts on lap 33 and finally succeeding on lap 38. Meanwhile, Vettel was judged to have forced Felipe Massa off the track when he overtook him for eighth place, handing him a five-second time penalty. On lap 40, Jolyon Palmer retired in the pitlane. While Rosberg initially closed in on Hamilton, the latter started to improve his lap times towards the end of the race. As Räikkönen got back into fifth at the expense of Pérez, Rosberg reported problems with his gearbox on the team radio. His team told him to avoid using seventh gear, following which Rosberg was able to consolidate his slim lead over Verstappen, which had initially come down due to his problem. Hamilton was unaffected by this and crossed the line to take victory, 6.9 seconds ahead of Rosberg. He was the first driver to win the British Grand Prix three times in a row and also became the record winner at the Silverstone circuit, with four victories. It was the 47th victory of his career.\nPost-race.\nOn the podium, Nico Rosberg was booed by the home crowd, mirroring a similar incident towards Hamilton at the previous race in Austria. Hamilton later told the press that he encouraged his fans not to act in such a way towards his teammate, saying: \"I honestly think us as Brits, the British fans, I think we're better than that.\" During the interviews at the podium ceremony, conducted by former Formula One driver Mark Webber, Hamilton had expressed his delight at the fact that the weather had made the race more difficult. Rosberg spoke of \"an exciting race\" against Verstappen and highlighted his \"very critical problem\" with his gearbox, but stressed that he felt confident that the instructions he received from his team to fix it were within the rules. However, the stewards – led by former driver Nigel Mansell – did not share his view and applied a ten-second time penalty for what they felt were instructions not compliant with the sporting regulations, demoting Rosberg to third place. The rules on instructions from the team to the driver had been tightened before the first race of the season, specifying that \"the driver shall drive the car alone and unaided\".\nFerrari team was unhappy with its performance over the weekend, with Vettel summing up: \"Overall it was not our day, not quick enough simple as that.\" He also expressed his irritation at receiving a five-second time penalty and two penalty points on his FIA Super Licence for an overtaking manoeuvre on Massa. Kimi Räikkönen on the other had declared that Ferrari's poor showing would prove to be a one-time incident, saying: \"I'm sure in the next races will be much more normal for us.\"\nAs a result of the race, Rosberg's lead in the Drivers' Championship over Hamilton was reduced to a single point (168 to 167 points), with Räikkönen following in third with 106 points. Sebastian Vettel fell back to fifth with 98 points, two points behind Daniel Ricciardo. In the Constructors' standings, Mercedes extended its lead over Ferrari to 131 points, while Red Bull closed in on Ferrari and was only six points behind."

The Test series was played for Warne–Muralitharan Trophy, with Sri Lanka winning 3–0, their first ever series whitewash against Australia. As a result, Australia slipped from first to third in the ICC Test Championship; Sri Lanka, who had started the series ranked seventh, moved up to sixth.\nIn August 2016, Sri Lankan batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan announced that he would retire from both ODI and T20I cricket at the end of the series. He retired from all international cricket on 9 September 2016.\nOn 6 September 2016, Australia recorded the highest ever Twenty20 International score of 263/3 in first T20I of the series. Australia won the ODI series 4–1 and the T20I series 2–0.\nSquads.\nWith injury concerns, the Sri Lankan selectors picked their Test squads on a match-by-match basis.

Their head coach was Roy Williams. No team captains were selected for this season, the first, and so far, only time this has happened in program history. The team played its home games in the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nRoster.\nWes Miller was not eligible to play this season because he transferred from James Madison.\nAfter playing as a walk-on in the previous season, David Noel received a basketball scholarship to play beginning with this season.\nSchedule and results.\nAfter Matt Doherty resigned from the men's basketball coaching position at the end of the previous season, Dean Smith once again persuaded Roy Williams to take the vacant position. This time Williams accepted, becoming the head coach of the Tar Heels on April 14, 2003.\nAfter the annual Blue-White Scrimmage and two exhibition games against North Carolina Central (then playing in NCAA Division II conference CIAA) and Team Nike, Williams' first game with the Tar Heels was against Old Dominion on November 22, 2003. Williams received a standing ovation as he stepped onto the court of the sold out Smith Center. With Smith and Bill Guthridge in attendance, the Tar Heels beat Old Dominion 90-64. The win was Williams' 419th career win.\nThe 115 points scored against George Mason were the most points Tar Heel team had scored against an opponent since 1994.\nThe triple-overtime loss to Wake Forest at home set several program records. The 114 points scored in this game are the most points scored in a Tar Heel loss. The Wake Forest loss was only the fifth time a game went into triple overtime in program history. The last time a game went into triple overtime prior to this season was in the 1982-83 season against Tulane (also the team, albeit in 1976, that the Tar Heels played against to set the program and ACC record of four overtimes). The 119 points that Wake Forest scored are the most points an opponent has scored over the Tar Heels, breaking the 112 points Maryland scored at Cole Field House in the previous season. Those points are also the most an opponent has scored against the Tar Heels in the Smith Center.\nBoth teams scored 16 points in the first overtime. The Tar Heels' 16 points are the Tar Heels' third most points in an overtime period, and Wake Forest's 16 points are the second most points a Tar Heel opponent has scored in halftime. In the second overtime, both teams only scored two points, respectfully the fewest points the Tar Heels and one of their opponents have scored in a halftime. The 13 points Wake Forest scored in the third overtime are the third most points a Tar Heel opponent has scored in an overtime.\nThe win against Miami was the 200th win in the Smith Center.\nThe Tar Heels beat Connecticut for the second consecutive year. The win was also the Tar Heels' tenth win over a number one ranked team (according to the AP Poll). At the time, the Tar Heels tied UCLA for most wins over a number one ranked team. (The Tar Heels now own this record outright, with 13 wins over number one ranked teams to UCLA's 12.)\nThe Tar Heels finished with their first winning record in two seasons, 17-10, but only finished fifth in ACC play with a conference record of 8-8. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the 2004 ACC men's basketball tournament by Georgia Tech. However, their overall record by the time of their loss in the ACC Tournament allowed them to play in the 2004 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The Tar Heels' NCAA tournament run ended with a defeat against Texas in the tournament's Second Round.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| NCAA tournament"

Christchurch and Hamilton were the venues scheduled to host the two Test matches.\nThe first Test of the series went ahead as planned on 17 November, despite Christchurch suffering a 7.8 magnitude earthquake, just after midnight on 14 November. However, no play was possible on the first day due to rain.\nNew Zealand won the series 2–0. This was New Zealand's first series win against Pakistan in Tests since 1985.\nSquads.\nAzhar Ali was appointed Pakistan's captain for the second Test after Misbah-ul-Haq left the tour after the death of his father-in-law. Misbah-ul-Haq was later given a one-match suspension by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for Pakistan's slow over rate in the first Test, and he would have missed the second Test because of this. Mitchell Santner replaced James Neesham in New Zealand's squad ahead of the second Test. Trent Boult was ruled out of the second Test with a knee injury and was replaced by Doug Bracewell."

        "title": "2016–17 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2016 NFL season began on Saturday, January 7, 2017. The postseason tournament concluded with Super Bowl LI on Sunday, February 5, 2017, when the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.\nAs of the 2022–23 playoffs, this is the last postseason in which the third and fourth seeds from both conferences all won a playoff game, the opposite outcome of the previous year when every wild-card team advanced to the second round.\nThis was the first postseason that the Super Bowl went into overtime, and the last until the 2023–24 playoffs.\nNFL Playoff schedule.\nSource:\nWild card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 7, 2017.\nAFC: Houston Texans 27, Oakland Raiders 14.\nThe Raiders were one of the most dominant teams in the AFC during the season, but in the final two weeks of the regular season, they lost starting quarterback Derek Carr and second-string quarterback Matt McGloin to injuries. The Raiders lost the last game and ended up going into the playoffs with Connor Cook under center, making Cook the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to make his first NFL start in the postseason. Houston also had plenty of problems during the season as well, scoring only 25 touchdowns, the lowest number by a playoff team since the NFL expanded to a 16-game season in 1978. But in this game, they proved more than a match for the Raiders, holding them to just 202 total yards and 2-for-16 on third down conversions while scoring 27 points, without losing any turnovers or allowing any sacks.\nEarly in the first quarter, Shane Lechler's 30-yard punt pinned the Raiders back at their own 7-yard line. Oakland gained only two yards on their ensuing drive and Marquette King's 31-yard punt gave the Texans excellent field position on the Raiders' 40-yard line, which they converted on a Nick Novak field goal from 50 yards. Three plays into Oakland's next drive, Houston lineman Jadeveon Clowney intercepted a screen pass from Cook and returned it three yards, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Menelik Watson adding another 15 yards and giving the Texans a first down on Oakland's 4-yard line. Lamar Miller then scored on a 4-yard touchdown run to give Houston a 10–0 lead with just over six minutes left in the first quarter. Both teams had to punt on their next possession and Jalen Richard returned Lechler's 51-yard kick 37 yards to the Texans' 38-yard line. Latavius Murray then rushed four times for 31 yards as the team drove to a touchdown on his 2-yard run, cutting the deficit to 10–7.\nIn the second quarter, Houston quarterback Brock Osweiler completed passes to tight end C. J. Fiedorowicz for yardage gains of 18 and 17 yards, respectively, while Miller added a 19-yard carry as the team drove 75 yards in 10 plays to score on Novak's 38-yard field goal, making the score 13–7. Later on, the Texans got the ball on their own 40-yard line with 2:25 left in the half. Osweiler completed a 19-yard pass to Will Fuller and a 38-yard pass to DeAndre Hopkins, then finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins that gave his team a 20–7 halftime lead. The third quarter started with six consecutive punts. With 28 seconds left in the period, Houston returner Tyler Ervin muffed King's 56-yard punt, but teammate Eddie Pleasant recovered the ball and returned it 12 yards to the Texans' 47-yard line. Houston then drove 53 yards in nine plays, including a 19-yard reception by Fuller, to score on Osweiler's 1-yard touchdown run and go up 27–7. After being completely shut down up to this point, Oakland's offense finally managed to respond, moving the ball 75 yards in 11 plays, with Cook completing 5 of 9 passes for 50 yards on the drive; three completions went to Andre Holmes for 37 yards, the last one an 8-yard touchdown pass to make the score 27–14. Oakland's defense then forced a three-and-out with 6:27 left, but safety Corey Moore ended the drive with an interception of a high pass intended for Amari Cooper. Cook was intercepted again in the final two minutes, by A. J. Bouye.\nOsweiler was 14-of-25 passing for 168 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 15 yards and a touchdown. Cornerback Johnathan Joseph had 10 solo tackles, while linebacker Whitney Mercilus had seven tackles (five solo) and two sacks. In his first start, Cook completed 18 of 45 passing attempts for 161 yards and a touchdown, with three interceptions.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 26, Detroit Lions 6.\nSeattle dominated the Lions, holding them to just 231 total yards, 13 first downs and 2-for-11 on third down conversions.\nAll drives in the first quarter ended in punts, except for the last one in which the Lions drove to a 4th-and-1 situation on the Seattle 38-yard line. On the first play of the second quarter, Matthew Stafford completed a pass to tight end Matthew Mulligan, but linebackers Bobby Wagner and K. J. Wright tackled him for a two-yard loss, causing a turnover on downs. Seattle then drove 60 yards in 14 plays, nine of them rushes by Thomas Rawls for 49 yards. Faced with 4th-and-goal on the Lions' 2-yard line, quarterback Russell Wilson threw the ball to Paul Richardson, who made a diving one-handed catch in the back of the end zone despite tight coverage (and a pass interference penalty) by safety Tavon Wilson, giving Seattle a 7–0 lead. Following a punt by the Lions, Rawls' 26-yard run and Wilson's 19-yard completion to Richardson set up Steven Hauschka's 43-yard field goal, increasing Seattle's lead to 10–0. Getting the ball with 1:55 left on the clock, Detroit responded as Stafford's completions to Anquan Boldin and Marvin Jones for gains of 16 and 30 yards led to a 51-yard Matt Prater field goal that made the score 10–3 with 20 seconds left before halftime.\nAfter forcing Seattle to punt on the opening drive of the second half, Stafford led the Lions 61 yards in 10 plays, featuring a 23-yard completion to fullback Zach Zenner, to score on Prater's 53-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 10–6. But after this, Seattle completely took over the game. They responded by driving 65 yards in 10 plays, including a 32-yard run by Rawls, scoring on Hauschka's 27-yard field goal three plays into the fourth quarter. Then after a punt, Wilson's 42-yard completion to Doug Baldwin initiated an 82-yard drive that ended on Rawls' four-yard touchdown run, making the score 19–6 after Hauschka missed the extra point. Another Detroit punt got them the ball back with less than eight minutes remaining and they went on to put the game away with an 11-play, 84-yard drive. The key play was Wilson's 27-yard completion to Richardson on 3rd-and-5 from the Seattle 33-yard line. Wilson eventually finished the drive with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Baldwin, making the final score 26–6.\nWilson completed 23 of 30 passes for 224 yards and a pair of touchdowns. His top target was Baldwin, who caught 11 passes for 104 yards and a touchdown. Rawls set a franchise playoff record with 161 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. Defensive end Cliff Avril had three tackles and two sacks. For the Lions, Stafford completed 18 of 32 passes for 205 yards; Jones caught four passes for 81 yards while defensive end Ezekiel Ansah had nine combined tackles (five solo) and two sacks. Prater made NFL history with two field goals greater than 50 yards in a playoff game.\nSunday, January 8, 2017.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 30, Miami Dolphins 12.\nIn their regular season meeting, Miami racked up 474 yards as they defeated Pittsburgh 30–15, but this game would have a very different outcome. The Steelers gained 387 yards, forced three turnovers, recorded five sacks and scored three touchdowns in the first half on the way to a dominant 18-point win.\nPittsburgh took the opening kickoff and drove 85 yards in 5 plays, scoring on Ben Roethlisberger's pass to Antonio Brown, who hauled in the short screen and took it 50 yards to the end zone. Then after a punt, the Steelers moved the ball 90 yards in 6 plays on the way to a 62-yard touchdown completion from Roethlisberger to Brown. This time Miami managed to respond, aided by Kenyan Drake's 33-yard kickoff return to the 41-yard line. Faced with 3rd-and-13 after two plays, Matt Moore completed a 36-yard pass to receiver Kenny Stills, setting up Andrew Franks' 38-yard field goal that cut their deficit to 14–3. But after getting the ball back, Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell carried the ball 9 times for 79 yards on a 10–play, 83-yard drive that ended with his 1-yard touchdown run, giving the team a 20–3 lead after Chris Boswell missed the extra point.\nMiami then drove 39 yards in 12 plays, scoring on Franks' 47-yard field goal with less than 5 minutes left in the second quarter. Pittsburgh responded with a drive to the Dolphins' 34-yard line, but with 1:12 left, Roethlisberger threw a pass that bounced off the outstretched hands of Brown and was intercepted by safety Michael Thomas, who returned it 16 yards to the Dolphins' 27-yard line. Miami subsequently moved the ball to the Steelers' 8-yard line, featuring a 37-yard completion from Moore to DeVante Parker. But on the next play, Moore lost a fumble while being sacked by James Harrison and Steelers defensive end Stephon Tuitt recovered the ball, allowing Pittsburgh to go into the half maintaining their 20–6 lead.\nEarly in the third quarter, safety Mike Mitchell forced a fumble while sacking Moore that Leterrius Walton recovered for the Steelers at their 41-yard line. Bell then rushed 3 times for 49 yards on the way to a 34-yard Boswell field goal that increased their lead to 23–6. Then on the first play after the kickoff, linebacker Ryan Shazier intercepted a pass from Moore and returned it 10 yards to the Dolphins' 25-yard line. Miami's defense managed to force a 4th down, but a neutral zone infraction penalty against Dolphins defensive back Tony Lippett on the field goal attempt gave Pittsburgh a new set of downs. The Steelers took full advantage of the opportunity, scoring on Bell's 8-yard touchdown run that made the score 30–6 with 2 minutes left until the fourth quarter. Miami responded with a drive to the Steelers' 42-yard line, but lost the ball when Tuitt tackled Moore for a 2-yard gain on 4th-and-4.\nMiami finally managed to get a touchdown in the fourth quarter—with 5:57 left—moving the ball 70 yards in 9 plays and scoring on Moore's 4-yard pass to running back Damien Williams. After a failed onside kick attempt, the Dolphins got one last chance to score when Xavien Howard intercepted Roethlisberger's pass and returned it 11 yards to the Miami 43-yard line. But the Steelers forced a turnover on downs at the Steelers' 33-yard line and ran out the clock to win the game.\nRoethlisberger completed 13 of 18 passes for 197 yards and two touchdowns, with 2 interceptions. Brown caught 5 passes for 124 yards and two scores, while Bell rushed 29 times for 167 yards—surpassing the previous franchise playoff record of 158 yards set by Franco Harris in Super Bowl IX—and a touchdown. Linebacker Lawrence Timmons had 14 tackles (8 solo) and 2 sacks. James Harrison had 10 tackles (6 solo), 1.5 sacks and a forced fumble. Moore finished with 29 completions on 36 passing attempts for 298 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. His top receiver was Jarvis Landry, who caught 11 passes for 102 yards. Another notable moment from this game was when Steelers linebacker Bud Dupree made a helmet to helmet hit on Matt Moore. He was called for a 15 yard penalty, and later fined $18,000.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 38, New York Giants 13.\nThis was the first wild card game between two former Super Bowl MVP quarterbacks. The Packers got revenge on the Giants with a 38–13 blowout after losing to the Giants in 2007 and 2011.\nAfter the game started with a few punts, Giants quarterback Eli Manning completed passes to Sterling Shepard for gains of 26 and 13 yards as the team drove 54 yards to score on Robbie Gould's 26-yard field goal. Meanwhile, their defense would keep Green Bay pinned down for the entire first quarter, holding them to just 7 net yards. To make matters worse, Packers receiver Jordy Nelson, their leading receiver during the season, was injured and did not return to the game. New York also suffered a big loss through injury though, defensive back Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, the team's regular season leader in interceptions.\nIn the second quarter, Green Bay punter Jake Schum pinned the Giants back at their 8-yard line with a 58-yard kick. A few plays later, Manning's 51-yard completion to tight end Will Tye set up another Gould field goal, increasing their lead to 6–0. Green Bay had to punt again on their next drive and once again they pinned the Giants back at their own 8-yard line with Schum's kick. This time, New York could not gain any net yards and safety Micah Hyde returned Brad Wing's 37-yard punt 7 yards to the Giants' 38-yard line. With excellent field position, the Packers' offense, that had been held in check all game, scored two touchdowns in the final 2:20 of the half. First, Aaron Rodgers completed a 31-yard pass to Davante Adams; then after a short running play, Rodgers threw the ball to Adams in the back left corner of the end zone, who made a diving catch past the outstretched arms of defensive back Coty Sensabaugh for a 5-yard touchdown reception. New York then had to punt in 3 plays after Bobby Rainey was stopped for no gain on 3rd-and-1. Taking the ball back on their own 20-yard line with 1:38 left, Green Bay used nearly all that time to drive to a 4th-and-2 on the Giants' 42-yard line. With six seconds left, Rodgers aired out a Hail Mary pass into the end zone, over the heads of numerous players and was caught by receiver Randall Cobb, giving the Packers a 14–6 halftime lead.\nFollowing a pair of punts to start the second half, Green Bay found themselves facing 3rd-and-1 on their own 42-yard line. This time the Giants would make a defensive stand; fullback Aaron Ripkowski was stopped for no gain by safety Landon Collins, then Ty Montgomery tried to run left tackle, but Collins and linebacker Jonathan Casillas tackled him for a 1-yard loss. One play after the turnover on downs, Manning threw a 41-yard touchdown pass to receiver Tavarres King, putting the Giants within one point at 14–13. However, this was all New York could do as Green Bay went on a run of 24 unanswered points. Christine Michael returned the ensuing kickoff 31 yards to the 37-yard line. Then Rodgers hit Jared Cook for 13 yards, Adams for 20 yards and Cobb for a 30-yard touchdown pass that gave the team a 21–13 lead. New York then went three-and-out and Hyde returned Wing's 50-yard punt 23 yards to the Giants' 37-yard line. Rodgers' subsequent 23-yard completion to Adams set up Mason Crosby's 32-yard field goal, upping their lead to 24–13. Three plays into the fourth quarter, New York had to punt again. Green Bay went on to drive 80 yards in 10 plays and go up 31–13 on Rodgers' 16-yard touchdown pass to Cobb. The key play of the drive was a 34-yard reception by Montgomery on 3rd-and-10 from the Packers' 30-yard line.\nThough the game was virtually over at this point, a few plays into New York's next drive, linebacker Clay Matthews III hit Manning as he was winding up for a pass. Since the ball went forward, both teams thought the result was an incomplete pass; Matthews realized no whistle had been blown and raced 10 yards downfield to recover the ball, plowing through running back Paul Perkins in the process. The ball was deemed live and was classed as a fumble recovery for Green Bay on the Packers' 45-yard line. Green Bay then drove 55 yards in 9 plays to make the final score 38–13 on Ripkowski's 1-yard touchdown run. New York responded with a drive to the Packers' 13-yard line, but Damarious Randall intercepted a pass from Manning with seconds remaining.\nRodgers completed 25 of 40 passes for 364 yards and four touchdowns. Cobb caught three touchdown passes out of five receptions, for 116 yards, while Adams had eight catches for 125 yards and a touchdown. Hyde had six tackles and five punt returns for 50 yards. For New York, Manning completed 23 of 44 passes for 299 yards, with a touchdown and an interception.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 14, 2017.\nNFC: Atlanta Falcons 36, Seattle Seahawks 20.\nThe Falcons' league-leading offense put up 422 total yards on their way to a 36–20 win over the Seahawks and their first trip to the NFC Championship since 2012.\nOn the game's opening possession, Seattle mounted a 14-play, 81-yard drive that lasted 8:36; Russell Wilson completed all four of his passes for 40 yards and rushed for 16 yards on the drive, eventually finding tight end Jimmy Graham for a seven-yard touchdown. Atlanta responded with their own 13-play, 75-yard drive on their first possession and tied the game with Matt Ryan's 7-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones on the second play of the second quarter. Devin Hester returned the ensuing kickoff 50 yards to the Seattle 45-yard line and the Seahawks advanced into Falcons territory with Wilson's 33-yard pass to Paul Richardson, who made a diving catch and then ran to the end zone. His catch was initially ruled a touchdown, but replays showed he was touched by Jalen Collins as he was falling to the ground, thus nullifying the scoring play. The drive ended up stalling and Seattle settled for a 33-yard field goal by Steven Hauschka. After Atlanta went three-and-out on their next drive, Hester returned the punt 80 yards to the Falcons' 7-yard line, but Seattle's Kevin Pierre-Louis was called for holding and the Seahawks were pushed back to their own 7-yard line. On the second play of the next drive, center Justin Britt accidentally stepped on Wilson's leg after the snap, causing Wilson to fall backwards into the end zone where he was downed by Ben Garland for a safety. Atlanta added two scores before the end of the half; first, Eric Weems returned the free kick 18 yards to the Falcons' 41-yard line. Ryan then completed a 37-yard pass to Taylor Gabriel that set up Matt Bryant's 35-yard field goal to give the Falcons a 12–10 lead. Seattle had to punt on their next drive and Jon Ryan's 60-yard kick pinned them back at their own 1-yard line. However, Atlanta advanced the ball all the way to the end zone, in nine plays. Ryan hit Mohamed Sanu for 22 yards, Gabriel for 18 yards and Jones for 20 yards before finishing the drive with a 14-yard touchdown pass to running back Tevin Coleman, increasing Atlanta's lead to 19–10 with 53 seconds left in the half.\nThe Falcons increased their lead on the opening drive of the second half, moving the ball 75 yards—29 yards of which from three carries by Coleman—in 13 plays on the way to Devonta Freeman's one-yard touchdown run that put them up by 16 points. This time, Seattle were able to respond, driving 80 yards in 14 plays, including a 40-yard completion from Wilson to Richardson. Hauschka finished the possession with a 31-yard field goal, cutting the score to 26–13. Atlanta took the kickoff; on 3rd-and-4, Ryan dumped off a short pass to Freeman, who then took off for a 53-yard gain to the Seahawks' 16-yard line, setting up Bryant's 31-yard field goal on the opening play of the fourth quarter. Seattle were able to get into Falcons territory later in the quarter, but Wilson threw an interception to Ricardo Allen who returned it 45 yards to the Seahawks' 46-yard line. Atlanta then drove 46 yards in 8 plays, the last one Ryan's three-yard touchdown pass to Sanu with 3:40 remaining to put the Falcons up by 23 points. Seattle were able to get back within 16 points after Hester returned the kickoff 78 yards and Wilson threw a 31-yard touchdown to Doug Baldwin, but Atlanta effectively sealed the game when Sanu recovered the resulting onside kick. On Seattle's final drive, Wilson was intercepted by Deion Jones.\nRyan finished as the game's leading passer with 26 completions on 37 attempts for 338 yards and three touchdowns. Freeman rushed for 40 yards and a touchdown, while also catching four passes for 80 yards and a touchdown. Wilson threw for 225 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, and also finished as the Seahawks' leading rusher with 49 yards. Hester returned five kickoffs for 198 yards.\nNew England Patriots 34, Houston Texans 16.\nNew England's defense intercepted Houston three times, while running back Dion Lewis scored three touchdowns—one rushing, one receiving and one kickoff return—as the Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship Game for the sixth year in a row.\nBig plays enabled New England to take a 14–3 lead after just 6 offensive plays. Following a three-and-out from both teams, Texans cornerback A. J. Bouye committed a 30-yard pass interference penalty while trying to cover Chris Hogan, giving New England a first down on Houston's 35-yard line. Quarterback Tom Brady completed two consecutive passes—the first to Hogan for 22 yards and the second to Lewis for a 13-yard touchdown completion. Houston responded by moving the ball 62 yards in 14 plays to score on Nick Novak's 33-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Lewis returned the ball 98 yards for a touchdown, the first kickoff return touchdown for the Patriots in postseason history.\nHouston had to punt after three plays, but on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a pass that went off the hands of Michael Floyd and was intercepted by Bouye, who returned it 7 yards to the Patriots' 27-yard line. Houston failed to get the ball into the end zone, but Novak kicked another field goal to make the score 14–6. Texans linebacker Akeem Dent forced and recovered a fumble from Lewis on the kickoff, getting the ball back for his team on the New England 12-yard line. This time, Houston was able to take it all the way, scoring on Brock Osweiler's 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end C. J. Fiedorowicz that made the score 14–13. After three consecutive punts, Brady's 48-yard completion to Julian Edelman gave New England a first down on the Houston 16-yard line. Eventually they got a first and goal from the 3-yard line, but could not score a touchdown, with a Stephen Gostkowski field goal giving the Patriots a 17–13 lead at halftime.\nAfter punts from each team at the start of the second half, Brady completed two passes to Edelman for 40 yards and one to Hogan for 22 yards before finding running back James White in the end zone for a 19-yard touchdown, putting the Patriots up 24–13. Later in the quarter, Devin McCourty's interception of an Osweiler pass gave New England the ball on their 44-yard line, but could not convert this into points. After a few punts, Brady threw a pass that was intercepted by Andre Hal, who returned it 6 yards to the Patriots' 34-yard line. Houston capitalized with Novak's third field goal on the second play of the fourth quarter, making it 24–16. New England had to punt on their next drive, but in what turned out to be a crucial play, Osweiler's first pass after the punt was intercepted and returned 23 yards by Logan Ryan, giving New England the ball on the Texans' 6-yard line. After a 5-yard carry, Lewis added a 1-yard touchdown run that gave the Patriots a 31–16 lead. The Texans were unable to achieve a first down on their next drive and New England drove 43 yards in 10 plays for Gostkowski's 43-yard field goal that gave them a 34–16 lead with under 7 minutes left. Houston's final drive resulted in Osweiler's third interception, this one to Duron Harmon.\nBrady completed 18 of 38 passes for 287 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, equaling his regular season total. Lewis rushed for 41 yards, caught two passes for 23 yards and returned three kickoffs for 124 yards, and became the first player in NFL postseason history to score touchdowns by rushing, receiving and kick return. Edelman caught eight passes for 137 yards and returned four punts for 24 yards, while Hogan had four receptions for 95 yards. Osweiler completed 23 of 40 passes for 198 yards and a touchdown, with three interceptions. The Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship Game for the sixth consecutive year, surpassing the Oakland Raiders of 1973 to 1977 for most consecutive appearances in conference championship games.\nSunday, January 15, 2017.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 34, Dallas Cowboys 31.\nIn a hard-fought back-and-forth game in which both teams gained over 400 yards of offense, Packers kicker Mason Crosby propelled the team to victory with two 50+ yard field goals in the final two minutes of the game, the second one set up by Aaron Rodgers's 36-yard completion to Jared Cook on 3rd-and-20 with three seconds left.\nDallas took the opening kickoff and drove 43 yards in 8 plays, scoring on Dan Bailey's 50-yard field goal to take a 3–0 lead. Green Bay appeared to go three-and-out when Aaron Rodgers threw an incompletion on 3rd down, but a defensive holding penalty on Benson Mayowa gave them a first down. Taking advantage of their second chance, Ty Montgomery rushed for 15 yards and Randall Cobb caught a pass for 16 yards before Aaron Rodgers finished the drive with a 34-yard touchdown pass to tight end Richard Rodgers II. The next time Green Bay got the ball, they scored again, driving 90 yards in 13 plays, including a 32-yard completion from Aaron Rodgers to Davante Adams. On the third play of the second quarter, Montgomery finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run, making the score 14–3.\nFollowing a punt, Aaron Rodgers led the Packers back for more points, completing 6 of 7 passes for 59 yards, the longest a 26-yard completion to Geronimo Allison. Fullback Aaron Ripkowski also made a big impact with a 20-yard run, while Montgomery finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run to give the team a 21–3 lead. After being dominated until now, Dallas scored 10 points before halftime. On their ensuing drive, Dak Prescott made two key completions to receiver Dez Bryant, the first for 21 yards and the second a 40-yard touchdown pass that cut their deficit to 21–10. On the kickoff, Packers returner Christine Michael muffed the kick and was downed on the 6-yard line, leading to a three-and-out that gave Dallas good field position when Cole Beasley returned the punt 8 yards to his own 49-yard line. Dallas then drove 36 yards in 10 plays, including an 18-yard catch by Beasley on 3rd-and-4, to score on Bailey's 33-yard field goal, cutting the score to 21–13 going into halftime.\nGreen Bay took the second-half kickoff and scored quickly, with Aaron Rodgers hitting Cobb for 25 yards, Adams for 14 yards and Cook for 26 yards, before finishing the drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Cook. Dallas responded with a drive to the Packers' 19-yard line, only to lose the ball when safety Micah Hyde intercepted Prescott's screen pass and returned it 18 yards to the Green Bay 39-yard line. Dallas' defense took the ball back with an interception by safety Jeff Heath, who returned the ball 27 yards to the Cowboys' 41-yard line. From there, Prescott completed 5 passes for 69 yards, the last a six-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten, making the score 28–20 with 11:39 remaining. After a Green Bay punt, Dallas drove 80 yards in 11 plays; the key player of the drive was rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott, who rushed five times for 34 yards. Bryant also played a major role, catching three passes for 24 yards, the last a 7-yard touchdown catch. Prescott scored the subsequent two-point conversion with a quarterback draw and the game was tied at 28–28. Green Bay got the ball back with 4:08 left and drove to a first down on the Cowboys' 35-yard line. A big play on the drive was a pass interference penalty against Anthony Brown that eliminated an interception. Two runs by Montgomery resulted in a net loss of 3 yards and an incompletion subsequently forced Crosby to try a franchise record 56-yard field goal with 1:38 left. Crosby's kick was good, the third longest in NFL postseason history, and the Packers took a 31–28 lead. Following a touchback on the kickoff, Prescott's completions to Terrance Williams, Witten and Beasley for gains of 24, 11 and 7 yards, respectively, got the team close enough for Bailey to make a 52-yard field goal, tying the game back up at 31–31 with 40 seconds remaining. Following a touchback, Aaron Rodgers completed a 17-yard pass to Montgomery, but was then sacked for a 10-yard loss by Heath. On 2nd-and-20, Rodgers threw an incomplete pass toward Cook on the right side. On 3rd-and-20, with 12 seconds left on the clock and one timeout remaining, Aaron Rodgers took the snap, rolled left and launched a 35-yard pass to Cook, who caught the ball while just barely keeping his feet in bounds along the left sideline. One referee initially ruled him out before another overturned him and called it a catch. After a booth review, the catch was upheld, giving Green Bay the ball at the Dallas 33-yard line with 3 seconds left. After being \"iced\" by the Cowboys on his initial kick, Crosby successfully kicked again from 51 yards, giving Green Bay a 34–31 win.\nAaron Rodgers completed 28 of 43 passes for 355 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, his first in 9 games. Cook caught six passes for 104 yards and a touchdown, while Montgomery rushed for 41 yards, caught four passes for 34 yards and scored two touchdowns. Hyde had four tackles, a sack and an interception. Crosby's two field goals extended his postseason record streak of consecutive field goals made to 23. Prescott finished the game 24-for-38 for 302 yards, three touchdowns—the first rookie to do so in the postseason in the Super Bowl era—and an interception. Bryant caught 9 passes for 132 yards and two touchdowns, while Elliott had 22 carries for 125 yards.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 18, Kansas City Chiefs 16.\nThis game was supposed to have started at 1:05 p.m., EST, but was pushed back to 8:00 due to inclement weather, making this game the first ever divisional round playoff game in NFL history to premiere on Sunday Night Football. Although Pittsburgh was unable to get into the end zone, Chris Boswell's postseason record six field goals were enough for them to become the first team to win a playoff game without scoring a touchdown since the 2006 Indianapolis Colts on their run to a victory in Super Bowl XLI.\nThe Steelers scored on the game's opening drive, moving the ball 65 yards in 11 plays on the way to Boswell's 22-yard field goal. Kansas City quickly struck back after Demetrius Harris returned Boswell's short kickoff 25 yards to their 45-yard line. The Chiefs then drove 55 yards in six plays, including a 21-yard catch by Travis Kelce, to score on Alex Smith's 5-yard touchdown pass to Albert Wilson, giving them a 7–3 lead. Pittsburgh stormed right back, as Ben Roethlisberger's 52-yard completion to Antonio Brown led to another Boswell field goal that made the score 7–6. On their next drive, they went 53 yards in 14 plays, scoring on Boswell's third field goal, to give them a 9–7 lead with just over 9 minutes left in the half. The Steelers soon got another chance to score when linebacker Ryan Shazier intercepted a pass from Smith on the Chiefs' 44-yard line. Three plays later, Roethlisberger returned the favor with an interception to Eric Berry in the end zone. Kansas City ended up punting after three plays and Brown returned it 6 yards to the Chiefs' 45-yard line. Le'Veon Bell then carried the ball 5 times for 32 yards on a drive that ended with Boswell's 4th field goal, this one from 45 yards, that increased their lead to 12–7. Shortly before halftime, the Steelers had one last scoring chance when cornerback Artie Burns recovered a fumble from Charcandrick West on the Chiefs' 40-yard line. Roethlisberger then completed a 29-yard pass to Brown, but he was tackled on the 11-yard line as time expired.\nOn Pittsburgh's first possession of the second half, Bell carried the ball five times for 49 yards, including a 38-yard rush on the first play, as the team drove to a 43-yard Boswell field goal that put them up 15–7. Both teams had to punt on their next possessions and Jordan Berry's 35-yard kick gave Kansas City the ball with good field position on the Steelers' 46-yard line. Smith then completed a 20-yard pass to Jeremy Maclin that set up Cairo Santos' 48-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 15–10 with 10 seconds left in the third quarter. Roethlisberger's completions to Eli Rogers and Jesse James for gains for 14 and 23 yards, respectively, on their next drive moved the team into position for Boswell to kick a record-setting sixth field goal of the game, which he made from 43 yards to give the team an 18–10 lead. For the Chiefs, Smith hit Kelce for a 24-yard gain on their first play and then Spencer Ware gained 11 yards on the ground. After a penalty pushed them into a 2nd-and-25, Smith completed a 17-yard pass to Kelce and a 12-yard completion to Chris Conley on 4th-and-8 allowed them to keep the ball. Several plays later, they faced 4th-and-2 on the Steelers' 4-yard line, but converted again with Smith's 3-yard pass to fullback Anthony Sherman. Ware scored on a 1-yard touchdown run on the next play that cut their deficit to 18–16. Smith completed a pass to Harris on the two-point conversion play, but was negated by a holding penalty on Eric Fisher as he tried to block an outside blitz from linebacker James Harrison. The second attempt was incomplete. With 2:43 left and one timeout remaining, Kansas City still had a chance to get the ball back, especially after Justin Gilbert was tackled on the 5-yard line during the kick return. However, Roethlisberger made completions to Rogers and Brown for gains of 5 and 7 yards, respectively, picking up a first down allowing the Steelers to run out the clock.\nRoethlisberger completed 20-for-31 passes for 221 yards and an interception; Brown caught six passes for 108 yards and returned two punts for 9 yards, while Bell rushed 30 times for 170 yards, giving him the highest total of combined yards by any running back in history over his first two playoff games. Bell also joined Terrell Davis as the only two players to rush for at least 160 yards in consecutive postseason games. Smith finished the game 20-for-34 for 172 yards, a touchdown, an interception and nine rushing yards. This was the fifth consecutive home playoff loss for Kansas City, setting a new NFL record. Kansas City also became the first team to lose a playoff game despite scoring more touchdowns than the opponent, with teams being 245–0 when doing so prior to this playoff game.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 22, 2017.\nNFC: Atlanta Falcons 44, Green Bay Packers 21.\nIn the final football game played at the Georgia Dome, Atlanta racked up 493 yards, scored on eight of their first nine drives, and converted 10 of 13 third downs as they advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1998.\nIn the first half alone, the Falcons gained 325 yards as they stormed to a 24–0 lead. On the game's opening drive, they moved the ball 80 yards in 13 plays, featuring a 31-yard reception by seldom-used fullback Patrick DiMarco. Matt Ryan finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown shovel pass to Mohamed Sanu that gave them an early 7–0 lead. Green Bay responded with a drive to the Falcons' 23-yard line, mainly the result of Jordy Nelson's two receptions for 41 yards, but they were unable to score as Mason Crosby, who had made an NFL record 23 consecutive postseason field goals before this game, missed from 41 yards. Ryan then led the Falcons back for more points, completing 4 of 7 passes for 56 yards on a 14-play, 59-yard drive. Matt Bryant kicked a 28-yard field goal that increased the lead to 10–0 with 14 seconds left in the first quarter.\nGreen Bay's next drive was remarkably similar to their last one: two key receptions from one receiver (Randall Cobb) picked up 39 yards as they drove to the Falcons' 23-yard line, but lost the ball with a fumble from fullback Aaron Ripkowski, forced and recovered by cornerback Jalen Collins. Back on offense, Ryan completed passes to Julio Jones for gains of 17, 20, and 19 yards, respectively, before he scrambled for a 14-yard touchdown. Later in the quarter, Falcons safety Ricardo Allen intercepted a pass from Aaron Rodgers on the Falcons' 32-yard line. This time, Ryan completed 5 of 7 passes for 59 yards and rushed for 9 additional yards on a 68-yard drive. Faced with 3rd-and-1 on the Packers' 5-yard line with 7 seconds left in the half, he finished the possession with a touchdown pass to Jones; the Falcons led 24–0, having scored on 4 of their 5 first-half drives.\nAtlanta scored another touchdown in the first minute of the second half after forcing Green Bay to punt. From his own 27-yard line, Ryan threw a 10-yard pass to Jones, who caught the ball and broke two tackles as he raced all the way to the end zone for a 73-yard touchdown completion. This time Green Bay managed to respond, with tight end Jared Cook catching 3 passes for 50 yards on a 75-yard drive that ended with Rodgers' 2-yard touchdown toss to Davante Adams, cutting the deficit to 31–7. Atlanta extended this to 37–7, with Devonta Freeman rushing 5 times for 28 yards on their own 75-yard drive, and finishing it off with a 4-yard touchdown catch. Rodgers rushed for a 28-yard gain on the first play of Green Bay's next possession, and later completed an 18-yard pass to Cook. With 38 seconds left in the third quarter, he finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Nelson; Ripkowski scored a 2-point conversion that cut the score to 37–15. Sanu recovered the ensuing onside kick attempt, returning it 9 yards to the Packers' 32-yard line.\nAtlanta then drove to their final score of the game, a 3-yard run by Tevin Coleman three minutes into the fourth quarter. Green Bay then drove 75 yards in 14 plays to score on Rodgers' 1-yard touchdown pass to Cook with six minutes left, culminating the scoring at 44–21. Ryan completed 27 of 38 passes for 392 yards and four touchdowns, as well as three carries for 23 yards and a touchdown. Jones caught nine passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns, while Freeman rushed for 42 yards, caught 4 passes for 42 yards, and scored a touchdown. Rodgers completed 27 of his 45 passing attempts for 287 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.\nAFC: New England Patriots 36, Pittsburgh Steelers 17.\nNew England advanced to their seventh Super Bowl in the last 16 seasons under quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick, racking up 431 yards and 26 first downs. Pittsburgh's offense had 368 yards, but could only score 17 points, eight of them on a touchdown late in the game with the outcome already decided. Meanwhile, the Steelers' rushing attack, that had been so critical to their earlier playoff wins, was crippled by an early injury to running back Le'Veon Bell, finishing the game with just 54 total yards on the ground.\nOn the game's opening drive, Brady's 41-yard completion to Julian Edelman set up Stephen Gostkowski's 31-yard field goal, giving New England a 3–0 lead less than two minutes into the game. Following several punts, the Patriots went on an 80-yard, 11-play drive, the longest gain being a 26-yard catch by receiver Chris Hogan. Brady finished it off with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Hogan, for a 10–0 lead. On the second play of Pittsburgh's next drive, Bell suffered a game-ending groin injury. However, his replacement DeAngelo Williams caught two passes for nine yards and rushed four times for 25 yards, the last carry a five-yard touchdown run to complete the 13-play, 84-yard drive early in the second quarter. Chris Boswell missed the extra point, with the score remaining 10–6.\nNew England stormed right back, driving 82 yards in nine plays and scoring on Brady's 34-yard touchdown pass to Hogan on a flea flicker play. Pittsburgh then moved the ball to the Patriots' 19-yard line, where Ben Roethlisberger threw a pass to tight end Jesse James that was initially ruled a touchdown, but a replay review determined James was down on the 1-yard line. On the next play, Williams was dropped for a one-yard loss by Dont'a Hightower and Patrick Chung. On second down, Williams was tackled for a three-yard loss by nose tackle Vincent Valentine. On third down, Roethlisberger's pass was incomplete, so the team settled for Boswell's field goal to make the score 17–9.\nNew England dominated the second half, burying the Steelers with four unanswered scores. After forcing them to punt, New England drove 55 yards in nine plays, 24 of them coming on a catch by Hogan. Gostkowski finished the drive with a 47-yard field goal that put the team up 20–9. Following another punt, Brady's 39-yard completion to Hogan led to a one-yard touchdown by LeGarrette Blount, giving the team a 27–9 lead with 2:44 left in the third quarter. On the first play after the kickoff, Kyle Van Noy forced a fumble from Eli Rogers that was recovered by linebacker Rob Ninkovich on the Steelers' 28-yard line. Brady completed an 18-yard pass to Edelman on the next play, and eventually found him in the end zone for a 10-yard touchdown pass. Gostkowski missed the extra point, but the Patriots had effectively put the game away with a 33–9 lead going into the fourth quarter.\nIn the final period, the Steelers drove to New England's 2-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs. Then after a punt, Eric Rowe intercepted a pass from Roethlisberger and returned it 37 yards to the Steelers' 32-yard line, leading to a Gostkowski field goal that increased New England's lead to 36–9. All that remained from this point on was Roethlisberger's garbage-time 30-yard touchdown pass to Cobi Hamilton and subsequent 2-point conversion pass to Williams that made the final score 36–17. Brady completed 32 of his 42 passing attempts for 384 yards and three touchdowns. Hogan caught nine passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns, while Edelman had eight receptions for 118 yards and a touchdown. Roethlisberger threw for 314 yards, with a touchdown and an interception.\nSuper Bowl LI: New England Patriots 34, Atlanta Falcons 28 (OT).\nDespite the Falcons taking a 28–3 lead midway through the third quarter, the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game at 28 with less than a minute left in regulation and take the game to the first overtime period in Super Bowl history. On the first possession of overtime, Patriots running back James White punched in the game-winning score to give his team a 34–28 comeback victory. Additionally, this was the first Super Bowl since XLVII four years earlier to not have both #1 seeds from their respective conferences against each other, as Atlanta was the #2 seed in the NFC.\nTelevision coverage.\nAll playoffs games were televised nationally on network television.\nABC simulcasted one AFC Wild Card game with ESPN, and one NFC Wild Card game was broadcast on NBC. Coverage of the remainder of the AFC playoff games was split between CBS and NBC, while the remainder of the NFC playoff games was broadcast by Fox. CBS had exclusive coverage of the AFC Championship Game while Fox had exclusive coverage of the NFC Championship Game and Super Bowl LI."

The tournament was won by Fred Davis who won 7 of his 9 matches, beating his brother Joe in all their three matches. Joe won 5 matches and finished in second place ahead of John Pulman by winning more frames overall. The News of the World Snooker Tournament ran from 1949/50 to 1959.\nFormat.\nThere were four competitors: Joe Davis, Fred Davis, John Pulman and Walter Donaldson. Rather than 3-day matches of 37 frames, matches were over 13 frames on a single day with each playing the others three times. Originally the tournament was planned to take place over three consecutive weeks but the third week of matches were delayed for three weeks. Unlike previous News of the World tournaments there was no handicapping. All matches were played in Burroughes Hall, London.\nThe highest of the competition was a 114 compiled by Fred Davis in his match against Pulman on 10 October. Davis also made the only other century break of the tournament, a 100 against Joe Davis on 18 October.\nResults.\nTable\nThe positions were determined firstly by the number of matches won (MW) and, in the event of a tie, the number of frames won (FW)."

        "text": "The 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup was the eighth edition of the Women's Rugby World Cup and was held in Ireland in August 2017. New Zealand became the 2017 champions by beating England 41–32 in the final on 26 August. Matches were held in Dublin and Belfast. The pool stages were held at University College Dublin with the semi-finals and finals held at Queen's University and Kingspan Stadium in Belfast.\nThe tournament took place three rather than four years after the previous Women's Rugby World Cup because World Rugby wanted to move away from clashing with other events. The event returned to a four-year cycle after 2017.\nThe 2017 tournament set attendance records for a Women's World Cup. The tournament drew 45,412 fans over 30 matches. The final was played in front of a crowd of 17,115, and the pool matches sold out.\nThis was the last edition of the tournament under the \"Women's Rugby World Cup\" name. On 21 August 2019, World Rugby announced that all future World Cups, whether for men or women, would be officially titled as the \"Rugby World Cup\", distinguished only by year and not by gender. As such, the 2021 edition in New Zealand bore the title of \"Rugby World Cup 2021\".\nBidding process.\nOn 2 March 2015, it was announced that the Irish Rugby Football Union had submitted a bid to host to Women's Rugby World Cup in August 2017. The Irish bid was the only one made to host the event. On 13 May 2015 it was announced that Ireland would host the event in Dublin and Belfast.\nOn 4 June 2015 it was announced that Garrett Tubridy had been appointed tournament director for the event.\nQualifying.\nIreland, the host nation, had already qualified automatically by finishing in the top seven teams at the 2014 tournament before being announced as hosts. A further six teams (England, Canada, France, New Zealand, the United States and Australia) qualified automatically as top seven finishers at the 2014 tournament. Italy and Wales qualified as the top two teams across the 2015 and 2016 Women's Six Nations excluding England, France, and Ireland. The remaining three qualifiers (Hong Kong, Spain and Japan) were determined by the end of 2016.\nMatch officials.\nIn March 2017, World Rugby announced the 9 referees and 5 assistant referees for the tournament.\nIn August 2017, it was announced that Irish referee Joy Neville would adjudicate the final.\nPool stage.\nThe pool draw took place on 9 November 2016 at Belfast.\nEach pool was a single round-robin of six games, in which each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same pool. Teams were awarded four points for a win, two points for a draw, one point for a loss by one to seven points, and none for a defeat by more than seven points. A team scoring four or more tries in one match scored a bonus point.\nThe tournament comprised 12 teams in three pools of four with the pool winners plus the best runner-up progressing to the semi-finals.\nAll times are local, Western European Summer Time ().\nFinals.\nKnockout Rankings.\nAt the completion of the pool stage, teams were ranked first according to their position within their pool (positions 1 to 3 were the pool winners, positions 4 to 6 were the pool runners up, etc.) and then by competition points. The top four teams progressed to the tournament semi-finals, teams ranked 5–8 progressed to the 5th to 8th play-offs, and the teams ranked 9–12 progressed to the 9th to 12th play-offs.\nTie breakers.\nIf teams were tied on pool points they were ranked by rules applied in the following order –&lt;br&gt;\n1. The team that won the match between the two teams was ranked first (does not apply to teams in different pools) &lt;br&gt;\n2. If the teams were still level, the difference between points scored and points conceded was used to rank the teams&lt;br&gt;\n3. Difference between tries scored and tries conceded was used to rank the teams&lt;br&gt;\n4. Most points scored &lt;br&gt;\n5. Most tries scored &lt;br&gt;\n6. Coin toss\nFinals.\nThe team ranked first after the pool stages played the team ranked fourth and the team ranked second played the team ranked third."

        "text": "The 1950 Sporting Record Masters' Snooker Tournament was a professional snooker tournament sponsored by the \"Sporting Record\" newspaper. Entry was restricted to past finalists in the World Snooker Championship. The tournament was won by Joe Davis with Sidney Smith finishing in second place. It was the only time the tournament was held.\nFormat.\nThe event was a round-robin snooker tournament and was played from 3 April to 10 June 1950. All matches were played at Leicester Square Hall in London. Initially there were 5 competitors and a total of 10 matches were planned. The competitors were Joe Davis, Fred Davis, Walter Donaldson, Horace Lindrum and Sidney Smith. Each match lasted six days and was the best of 70 frames. Three points were available for each match, one for winner of the match, one for leader after the first 35 frames and one for the winner over the last 35 frames.\nEach player was given a handicap at the start of the tournament. The handicaps were: Joe Davis, Fred Davis and Donaldson: 0, Smith: 21 and Lindrum: 23. The player with the higher handicap received a start in each frame, being the difference between the two handicaps.\nHorace Lindrum withdrew from the event complaining about his overly generous handicap of 23 points which would give the public the wrong impression about his ability. It was also announced that Lindrum had retired from snooker but Lindrum later issued a statement stating that he had not retired \"in any sense whatever.\" His elder daughter Jan was born in London during the period when Lindrum should have been playing his first match.\nResults.\nThe original 10-week schedule was retained, despite Lindrum's withdrawal. This meant that there were 4 weeks when no match was played. The first match was played over 5 days rather than 6 because Good Friday fell on 7 April. The first 35 frames finished after the afternoon session on the Wednesday. After 5 days of the Sidney Smith/Fred Davis match Smith was leading 41–18 with a 19–5 lead in the second half of the match. The final score for Sidney Smith versus Fred Davis was 46–24.\nTable "

        "title": "Golf course community",
        "text": "A golf course community is a type of residential housing development built around a golf course.\nHistory.\nTemple Terrace, Florida is often described as the first planned golf-course community in the United States, dating from the 1920s. The community was intended only for the very wealthy who would reside there for an only a few months of the year during the winter. For example, the original homes were built without kitchens as it was planned that they would dine at the community clubhouse.\nAs golf became a sport also played by the middle class of the United States by the 1950s and 1960s, golf course communities also were developed for those players. During a period of \"boom growth\" in United States golf courses in the 1960s, approximately 25% of courses built each year were developed as a part of a real estate development.\nThat percentage rose to 60% during the 1990s as \"master planned golf communities\" grew in popularity. Under this model, the operating costs of the golf course were to be subsidized by lot sales, and lots would be sold a premium due to their location on the course. This led, however, to many unprofitable courses, and the closing of many courses.\nIn 1999, it was reported that three states with the most golf course communities in the United States were Florida with 419, California with 137, and North Carolina with 126.\nIn 2009, it was estimated that of 16,000 golf courses in the United States, more than 3,200 were part of a real estate development. More than fifty such courses closed between 2006 and early 2009.\nWhen a development's golf course closes, a developer typically seeks to build houses or otherwise develop the former course property, leading to disputes with homeowners who purchased homes based on their views of the course. Often, however, though buyers assumed the course would always remain in the community, there is no legal basis to force the course to continue operations. In 2015, a survey of the National Association of Home Builders found that two-thirds of homebuyers are not seeking to live on a golf course. Declining interest in golf communities has led to reports of decreasing home values."

        "title": "Illinois–Indiana men's basketball rivalry",
        "text": "The Illinois–Indiana men's basketball rivalry is an intra-Big Ten Conference, college sports rivalry between the Illinois Fighting Illini and Indiana Hoosiers. Multiple factors have played into the creation of the games between the two schools; Illinois and Indiana share a state border and are located about apart, they share recruiting ground, and for many decades both teams played in a facility named Assembly Hall.\nHistory.\nIllinois and Indiana first met on January 20, 1906 with an Illinois victory, 27-24. Since the two teams are both in the Big Ten Conference, they meet at least once a season. The location of the game alternates between Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington and the State Farm Center, formerly Assembly Hall, in Champaign. There have been a total of five overtime games in this series.\nIn mid-1980s Indiana head coach Bob Knight brought allegations to the NCAA that Illinois assistant coaches had acted improperly in the recruitment of Lowell Hamilton. Hamilton was the focus of a recruiting competition between Illinois and Indiana, and while the allegations of improper conduct were unfounded by the NCAA, the controversy had some level of impact on the games at the time.\nOn March 10, 1991, after an Indiana victory in Champaign, a profanity-laced shouting match between Knight and Fighting Illini coach Lou Henson erupted outside the team locker rooms. The incident started when Knight left the Assembly Hall court with seven seconds remaining in the game, skipping the traditional postgame handshake while laughing and waving to the Illinois crowd. This incident enraged Henson to the point of confronting Knight outside of the locker room. Henson's anger continued as he spoke out against Knight at the postgame press conference.\nIn a game at Bloomington on February 25, 1998, Indiana head coach Bob Knight was issued two technical fouls by referee Ted Valentine for first arguing a call after a hard collision between Illinois guard Sergio McClain and Indiana guard Luke Recker in which McClain was issued a technical foul for touching the rim after blocking Recker's shot. Coach Knight argued the call should have been goaltending. From the collision, Recker fell hard to the court in pain. To check on his player, Coach Knight rushed to the court for which he was issued the second technical foul by Valentine.\nOccasional feuds and incidents between the schools' programs have fueled the competition over the years. Illinois has dominated Indiana in the short history of the Big Ten tournament. Since the onset of the conference tournament, Illinois and Indiana have played a total of 9 times. Illinois holds the record of 6-3 over Indiana. In the 1999 Big Ten tournament the Hoosiers and the Illini faced each other and Illinois won the game 82-66. Illinois would go on to win 4 of the next 5 tournament meetings.\nAnother feud is less focused on the tension between the two schools, but rather a former Illinois head coach and his ties to Indiana. Bruce Weber coached the Fighting Illini from 2003–12, but the history between Weber and Indiana began before he set foot in Champaign. As head coach at Southern Illinois University for five years from 1998-2003, he scheduled some non-conference meetings against Indiana. Before that, Weber served as an assistant coach under Gene Keady at Purdue University for 18 years. During his tenure at Illinois, Weber noted that there was tension between himself and Indiana (see Indiana–Purdue rivalry).\nIn 2007 there was a recruiting battle between the schools over Indiana Mr. Basketball, Eric Gordon. Gordon initially verbally committed to play for Illinois. However, when Mike Davis resigned as Indiana's head coach and Kelvin Sampson was hired, Gordon decommitted and signed his National Letter of Intent to play for Indiana.\nAccomplishments by the two rivals.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs.\nGame results.\nGames with both teams ranked.\nWinning team is shown. Ranking of the team at the time of the game by the AP poll is shown by the team name."

On December 15, 2013, the team moved to North America to compete in the North American League of Legends Championship Series (NA LCS). The team later changed its name to Team Impulse.\nHistory.\nLMQ was formed on July 5, 2013, after merging portions of the rosters of Team Livemore and Royal Club Tian Ci: Dreams, F1sh, and Wayoff from the former; Mor, NoName, TS, XiaoWeiXiao, and PandaB from the latter. LMQ competed in the summer split of the 2013 LPL; despite taking a game off the Season 3 runner-up Royal Club, LMQ finished with a disappointing 8–13 record in sixth place.\nIn November 2013, after the Season 3 World Championship, F1sh and PandaB moved to LMQ's sister team, Royal Club. At that month's National Electronic Sports Tournament, LMQ went 2–1 in the tournament's group stage after downing CC Club and Team WE Academy while falling to the parent Team WE. In the bracket stage, LMQ lost 1–2 to the tournament favorite and eventual winner OMG, but rebounded in a 2–0 victory against Royal Club in the third place match.\nOn December 15, 2013, LMQ left its parent organization Tian Ci and obtained a new sponsor in iBUYPOWER. With the assistance of its new sponsor, LMQ moved to North America to take advantage of the superior esports infrastructure. At this point, Dreams and Wayoff left the team, to be replaced by Royal Club top laner GoDlike, who renamed to ackerman.\nIn January 2014, LMQ made their way atop the North American 5v5 Challenger tier and earned an invite to the official Riot-sponsored Challenger Series, also known as the Coke League. In their North American debut, LMQ went 8-0 and beat compLexity. Black 2–0 in the finals. By finishing first, LMQ received 9 Challenger Series Points and earned a berth in the second series. There, in March, LMQ went 4–1 on their way to a 2–0 win in the finals against Cloud 9 Tempest, thus clinching the top overall seed in the Challenger Series playoffs to be held later in the season.\nWhile competing in the second Challenger Series, LMQ was also offered an invite to the North American Challenger League (NACL) Season 2 Qualifiers, where they went undefeated and secured a spot in the league. During the league's regular season, LMQ went 18-4 without a losing record against any team. During the March playoffs, LMQ defeated Cloud 9 Tempest 2–1 in the semifinals and moved on to face Team 8 in the tournament's grand finals. LMQ won the final series 3-1 and became NACL champions.\nAfter having secured a spot in the semi-finals of the Challenger Series playoffs due to their tremendous number of points accumulated from both Challenger Series, LMQ went on to defeatCurse Academy in a 2–0 victory sending them to the finals against the tough Cloud 9 Tempest. After an initial loss in the best of five series, LMQ came back winning two in a row to make the series 2–1. Cloud 9 Tempest however, bounced back in game four to tie up the series 2-2. After a very low-kill game game five, Cloud 9 Tempest attempt to make a pick, but instead gets nearly aced and losing the game to LMQ. LMQ left the Challenger Series playoffs with a 5–2 record and went home with the grand prize of $16,000.\nIn April 2014, LMQ secured a spot for the 2014 NA LCS Summer Split after beating XDG Gaming 3–0 in the 2014 Season Summer Promotion Tournament.\n2015 Preseason.\nOn November 24, 2014, Alex Gu announced that LMQ's 2015 roster would include XiaoWeiXiao once again and that Popstar Adrian had signed with the team as their new support player.\nOn December 26, 2014, LMQ announced it was rebranding to Team Impulse."

        "title": "2016 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "Roger Federer's 2016 tennis season officially commenced on 3 January 2016, with the start of the Brisbane International, and ended on 8 July 2016, with a loss in the semifinals of the Wimbledon Championships.\nThis season saw Federer suffer from a knee injury which sidelined him for the majority of the year. After surgery, Federer returned but was hindered by a back injury which kept him out of the French Open, therefore ending his record of 65 consecutive appearances at Grand Slam tournaments.\nOn July 26 Federer officially ended his season early, not wanting to risk damaging his knee further. Federer would thus end the year at No. 16 in the ATP rankings, marking the first time that he dropped out of the top 10 since 2002. Additionally, this was the first season since 2000 in which Federer did not win a singles title.\nYear summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nBrisbane International.\nFederer opened his season at the Brisbane International for the third consecutive year, after winning the title in 2015. As the top seed, he received a bye in the first round. Although suffering with the flu virus, he beat Tobias Kamke in the second round in straight sets. He then defeated Grigor Dimitrov in three sets to advance to the semifinals. In the semifinals, he defeated Dominic Thiem in straight sets to advance to his third consecutive final at the tournament. He faced Milos Raonic in a repeat of the 2015 final, losing in straight sets. According with himself, Federer's performance was hindered throughout the tournament due to the flu virus.\nAustralian Open.\nFederer entered the Australian Open as the third seed. He defeated Nikoloz Basilashvili and Alexandr Dolgopolov, both in three straight sets to advance to the third round. There, he beat Grigor Dimitrov in four sets, in a win that marked Federer's 300th match win at a Grand Slam. He became the first man in the open era to reach this milestone and the second overall player behind Martina Navratilova, who won 306 matches. He reached the quarterfinals with an easy three set win over David Goffin in the fourth round. He then defeated Tomáš Berdych in straight sets to advance to his 12th Australian Open semifinal, where he faced Novak Djokovic in their first match of the year and their 45th meeting overall. Federer lost the match in four sets and this loss put Djokovic ahead in their rivalry for the first time.\nInjury hiatus.\nIn the day after his loss to Djokovic, Federer sustained a knee injury. In early February, he underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus, thus missing both the scheduled Rotterdam Open and Dubai Tennis Championships. Later in the month, Federer announced he would also miss the Indian Wells Masters. In March, it was confirmed that he would make his return at the Miami Open.\nMiami Open.\nAs the third seed, and after a first round bye, Federer was scheduled to face Juan Martín del Potro in the second round in his comeback match. However, he would pull out of the tournament due to contracting a stomach virus, thus prolonging his time on the sidelines.\nSpring clay court season.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nAfter a ten-week hiatus, Federer made his return at the first clay court Masters 1000 tournament, the Monte-Carlo Masters. As the third seed, he received a first round bye and in the second round won his first match since January by defeating Guillermo García López in straight sets to advance to the third round. He proceeded to defeat Roberto Bautista Agut to reach the quarterfinals, where he lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in three sets despite being two points away from the win.\nMadrid Open.\nFederer was expected to play the Madrid Open, but he was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to a back injury.\nItalian Open.\nUpon pulling out of Madrid, Federer entered the Italian Open. Despite that, and after a first round bye, he stated that he almost withdrew prior to his opening round due to lingering fitness issues. However, after a morning practice, he decided to play rising teenage star Alexander Zverev, defeating him in straight sets. Again at the last minute, Federer decided to play his third round match against Dominic Thiem, but this time he was beaten in straight sets as the back injury continued to hamper his speed and movement. This tournament cast further doubt on Federer's participation in the upcoming French Open.\nFederer ended up withdrawing from the second major of the year not wanting to further aggravate his injury before the start of the grass court season. That marked the end of his all-time record run of 65 consecutive appearances at majors, which began in the 2000 Australian Open.\nGrass court season.\nStuttgart Open.\nFederer took advantage of the recently expanded grass court season, first instituted in 2015, by playing in a newly minted grass court tournament, the Stuttgart Open. After a bye in the first round he started the tournament by defeating Taylor Fritz in three sets, in a rainy match played over two days. In the quarterfinals, he defeated qualifier Florian Mayer in straight sets, advancing to the semifinals. In the semifinals, he lost to No. 3 seed Dominic Thiem after holding two match points in the second set tiebreak. He lost a grass court match after having a match point for only the second time in his career.\nHalle Open.\nFederer then entered the Halle Open as an eight-time champion and three-time defending champion. He defeated Jan-Lennard Struff, Malek Jaziri and David Goffin in the first three rounds, reaching the semifinals without losing a set in the process. In the semifinals, however, he lost to 19-year-old Alexander Zverev in three sets. Remarkably, this was the first time in which Federer lost before the final in this tournament since the 2002 edition.\nWimbledon.\nAfter a short break, Federer travelled to London to play Wimbledon, his second major of the year. He began the tournament with victories over Guido Pella, qualifier Marcus Willis, Daniel Evans and Steve Johnson, all in straight sets, reaching the quarterfinals in the process. In the quarterfinals he played and defeated Marin Čilić in an extremely tight match, in which he lost the first two sets before coming back to win the next three, saving three match points in the fourth set. However, he ended up losing to world No. 7 Milos Raonic in the semifinals after another tight five-setter.\nOut for the rest of the season.\nOn July 26 Federer announced that he would not play anymore in 2016, due to a knee injury, therefore not being able to defend his titles at the Cincinnati Masters and the Swiss Indoors as well as the runner-up position at the US Open. As a result, Federer dropped out of the top 5 in the ATP rankings for the first time since the week of 3 March 2014. His ranking also fell out of the top 10 for the first time since 2002, ending a remarkably 14-year streak. This was also the first season since 2000 in which Federer did not win a singles title in a calendar year.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Roger Federer in 2016, including walkovers (W/O) which the ATP does not count as wins or losses.\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nRoger Federer has a ATP match win–loss record in the 2016 season. His record against players who were part of the ATP rankings Top Ten at the time of their meetings is . Bold indicates player was ranked top 10 at time of at least one meeting. The following list is ordered by number of wins:"

        "text": "The 1977 Rugby League World Cup final was the conclusive game of the 1977 Rugby League World Cup tournament and was played between Australia and Great Britain on 25 June 1977 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia.\nBackground.\nThe 1977 Rugby League World Cup was the eighth staging of the Rugby League World Cup since its inauguration in 1954, and the first since the 1972 tournament. The tournament was held in the Australia and New Zealand from 29 May, culminating in the final between Australia and Great Britain on 25 June.\nAustralia.\nAustralia were undefeated going into the final.\nMatch details.\nAlthough this was an international match, the Kangaroos player numbers were as used in Australia at the time with the forwards numbers being reversed (e.g. the front rowers wore numbers 11 and 13 rather than 8 and 10). Great Britain played in the standard international numbers.\nAfter their 19–5 win over Great Britain a week earlier at Lang Park in Brisbane (which actually drew 2,543 more fans than the Final), the Australians went into the Final as warm favourites. However, led by experienced captain Roger Millward, the Lions managed to dominate possession throughout the game, and it took a last minute try from Australian halfback John Kolc (playing his only international game for Australia) to secure the Cup in front of 24,457 spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nFirst half.\nThe Australian's opened the scoring through Allan McMahon who scored in the Paddington corner. Michael Cronin kicked the sideline conversion and Australia led 5–0. Great Britain soon his back with a try to Steve Pitchford. George Fairbairn converted the try to lock the scores at 5–5. The match was then highlighted by a 60-metre try to Australian centre Russel Gartner who pounced on a dropped ball from Lions fullback Fairbairn after a Great Britain scrum win to race away and score. Only converging defence from Gartner's opposite number Les Dyl kept him from scoring closer to the posts, giving Cronin a difficult conversion from midway between the posts and the touch line. Cronin missed the attempt and the Australian's led 8–5. Fairbairn then kicked a penalty goal to make the scores 8–7 closing in on half time.\nLate in the first half the gritty and determined Lions were considered unlucky not to score when they were denied what would have been a certain try to winger Stuart Wright by English referee Billy Thompson. Wright had intercepted a pass from Cronin to Mark Harris 15 metres from the Australian line and was racing downfield with no one near him when Thompson called play back for an obstruction penalty to Great Britain rather than play advantage. Had Wright scored, and likely under the posts, it could have given the visitors a 12–8 lead going into the break. Instead, soon after Cronoin kicked a penalty goal from in front of the posts to make the score 10–7 going into half time.\nSecond half.\nAustralia took the lead out to 13–7 after a try to John Kolc in the Randwick corner in front of the Bradman Stand. Fairbairn had dropped a downfield kick by Cronin and the ball was pounced upon by Allan McMahon. From acting half, Kolc then dummied which fooled Fairbairn and Bill Francis and he raced away to score in the corner. Cronin missed the difficult kick from the sideline and the score remained at 13–7.\nThe Lions then hit back with a try under the posts to replacement back Ken Gill which was converted by Fairbairn to bring the scores to 13–12. After Kolc was penalised for using an elbow on Roger Millward who was chasing his own chip-kick, Fairbairn then had a late chance to give Great Britain the lead with a penalty goal from 45 metres out, though his went just to the right of the posts into the waiting arms of Australian fullback Graham Eadie who took full advantage of the Lions defence line still being near halfway to run the ball back outside the Australian quarter line."

In terms of the domestic league Hull KR were relegation threatened having entered the qualifiers whereas Leeds Rhinos would be the eventual champions, both in terms of the Grand Final and the League Leaders.\nRoute to the final.\nHull KR.\nAs a team that did not quality for the 2014 Super League Super 8's, Hull KR entered the competition in the fifth round which saw them draw Championship leaders Bradford Bulls. A 50–30 victory saw them play eventual Super League runners-up Wigan Warriors, beating them 16 points to 12. The quarter finals and semi-finals saw KR play midtable teams Catalans Dragons and Warrington Wolves, beating them by six and eight points respectively.\nLeeds Rhinos.\nEntering at the sixth round, Leeds drew Super League title rivals Huddersfield Giants over whom they scored a comfortable victory by 32 points. The quarter finals saw them beat Hull F.C. 24 points to six, before facing another title rival, St Helens, in the semi-finals, beating them 24 points to 14.\nPre-match.\nThe 2014 Britain's Got Talent winners Collabro provided musical entertainment prior to the match. The pre-match also saw a tribute to Danny Jones who died of a cardiac disease earlier in the season whist playing for Keighley Cougars. His widow, singer Lizzie Jones, would sing Abide with Me before the game.\nPost match.\nLeeds Rhinos beat their own record of the largest win margin during a Challenge Cup Final. They previous set the record during the 1999 Challenge Cup Final where they beat London Broncos 52 points to 16.\nThis Challenge Cup victory would form part of Leeds Rhinos's treble winning season, becoming only the sixth team in British Rugby to achieve this feat. The treble season would mark club captain Kevin Sinfield's retirement from the sport after first captaining the club to win the remaining two trophies of the treble."

The Empire League plays a 40-game regular season followed by a five-game post season. The four-team league consists exclusively of teams from Upstate New York. League offices are in Tampa, Florida.\nHistory.\nThe Empire League is a replacement of the North Country Baseball League, which folded after one season (and was itself a last-minute replacement for the East Coast Baseball League, which disbanded before the start of the 2015 season). The league fielded four teams based in the states of New York, New Hampshire and Maine for its inaugural season.\nIt is a low-budget league meant to give players recently graduated from college or with little professional experience an opportunity at staying in shape and providing them the chance at being signed to higher level league contracts with affiliated or independent teams. All league funding comes from advertisement sales, ticket sales and tryout revenue.\nThe league is operated by Eddie Gonzalez, former professional baseball player and NAIA All-American at Webber International University. Gonzalez is also a former NCBL executive.\nThe Sullivan Explorers, despite finishing the regular season with a losing record, won the 2016 league championship over the regular season winner Watertown Bucks.\nPrior to the league's second season, the Watertown Bucks lost the lease to their stadium and were replaced by the Plattsburgh Redbirds. The New Hampshire Wild ceased operations and were replaced by a team from Puerto Rico; however, since a stadium deal in Puerto Rico had not yet been finalized, the team played the 2017 season as a travel team.\nThe league expanded to six teams for the 2018 season with two new franchises selected from four of the nine interested parties visited in 2017. On February 23, 2018, the league announced that one team will be a revival of the New Hampshire Wild, and the sixth team would be the return of the New York Bucks, formerly known as the Watertown Bucks.\nOn May 31, 2018, the league announced the Puerto Rico Islanders will play in Rincon, Puerto Rico, and the Sullivan Explorers would be known as the Aguada Explorers. For 2019, the Explorers would become a traveling team, and the Surge would move to Saranac Lake, New York.\nDue to Covid-19, the 2020 Empire Professional Baseball League was held at Consol Energy Park in Washington, Pennsylvania.\nIn 2021, the Empire Professional Baseball League returned to normal operating procedures with the following teams: Saranac Lake Surge, Tupper Lake Riverpigs, Plattsburgh Thunderbirds and New Hamphire Wild.\nIn 2022, the New Hamphire Wild were replaced by the Japan Islanders, a traveling team composed of mostly native Japanese players.\nThe 2023 season will see the league expand to five teams with the addition of the Malone Border Hounds.\nThe 2024 season saw the Japan Islanders stop play in the Empire League, while the Plattsburgh Thundbirds rebranded to the North County Thunderbirds."

The 1939 UCLA team was one of sports legend, featuring three African-American stars: future baseball great Jackie Robinson, fellow halfback and National Football League color-barrier buster Kenny Washington, and fleet-footed Left End and Los Angeles Rams teammate of Washington, Woody Strode. When the Strode departed from UCLA after the 1939 season, the Sophomore Smith and was named by UCLA head coach Babe Horrell to start for the Bruins in 1940 at Strode's Left End position.\nOfficially listed at the playing weight of 180 pounds during his first year as a UCLA starter, Smith wore jersey number 48 for the Bruins. As was the case for all American football players in the era before free substitution, Smith played on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball. Smith's 1940 season was cut short by injury, however, when he suffered a broken leg in the third quarter of a November 23 drubbing at the hands of the Washington Huskies.\nDespite the abrupt and painful end to his 1940 season, Smith's play still merited his inclusion by sportswriters as a second-team member of the 1940 Associated Press All-Pacific Coast Football Team.\nSmith was able to rehabilitate his injury and was ready for return to the UCLA starting lineup at the left end position in time for the start of the 1941 season, where he would once again become a favorite target of future Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Waterfield. Smith was, going into the season, included in the discussion of All-American candidates at the end position. Smith's season ultimately failed to live up to high preseason hopes, however, and he was relegated to honorable mention status on the 1941 All-Pacific Coast Football Teams by sports editors associated with United Press International publications.\nIn the 1942 season, Smith was tapped by the Associated Press for All-Pacific Coast 3rd Team honors. Smith would start for UCLA in the 1943 Rose Bowl at Pasadena, California, won by the University of Georgia Bulldogs, 9–0.\nMilitary service.\nFollowing graduation at UCLA in 1943, Smith was enlisted in the United States Army and shipped out to armored command officer candidates' school at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Despite the presence of at least four other officer candidates with college bowl football experience at Fort Knox, the facility had no military service football team and Smith was outside of the game for the year. Nevertheless, Smith was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1944 National Football League draft in the 23rd Round, making Smith the 234th selection overall for the year. He signed with the Eagles and saw action in 5 games before shipping out to Europe.\nDuring World War II Smith was commissioned as a lieutenant.\nSmith was very badly wounded at the Battle of the Bulge and nearly left for dead by medics. Someone spotted his engraved 1943 Rose Bowl watch, however, and shouted, \"This is one guy we've got to save!\" causing extraordinary measures to be taken to help Smith survive. Fully 18 months of convalescence followed, as Smith slowly recovered from his severe wartime wounds.\nAfter football.\nIn addition to being a football player, Smith was a very proficient equestrian, chess player, and yachtsman. He was the proprietor of Smith's Sporting Goods, located in Westwood. The store was located at 10863 West Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles.\nSmith was a resident of Marina del Rey, California, during his final years.\nDeath and legacy.\nSmith died August 5, 2010, in Los Angeles, California. He was 91 years old at the time of his death.\nSmith was preceded in death by his wife, Virginia Smith, and survived by one of his two daughters, as well as various other relatives."

After winning the first set 6–1, Mustard was unable to repeat that performance in the second but had opportunities in the next two sets. He led Wilander 5–2 in the third set and 3–0 in the fourth, but the Swede was able to secure both sets and the match. \nHis best performance in a Grand Slam tournament came in the 1985 Wimbledon Championships when he made the third round, as a qualifier. He defeated Stuart Bale and Marc Flur, before being eliminated by Kevin Curren.\nAs a doubles player, he had some success with British player Jonathan Smith. The pair made the round of 16 at the 1985 French Open and won two Challenger titles. His other Challenger title in doubles came with Russell Simpson, with whom he made the semi-finals at a Cleveland Grand Prix tournament in 1984.\nMustard played in one Davis Cup tie for New Zealand, against Taiwan in Auckland in 1985, which the home side won 5-0. He defeated Hsu Huang-Jung in the first singles rubber and was also used in the doubles, with David Lewis.\nHe now works as a tennis coach in Herne Bay, Auckland."

The ground is sometimes described as \"the Lord's of Sri Lanka\". The first One Day International match played on the ground was in 1982 against England and it staged its first Test match in 1984 against the touring New Zealand side. The first Twenty20 International played on the ground was in 2010 when Canada faced Ireland.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. This article details the five-wicket hauls taken on the ground in official international Test and One Day International matches.\nThe first bowler to take a five-wicket haul in an international match on the ground was Sri Lanka's Ravi Ratnayeke, who took five wickets for the cost of 42 runs (5/42) against New Zealand in the first Test on the ground. The best innings bowling figures in Test matches on the ground were taken by fellow Sri Lankan Rangana Herath, who took 9/127 against Pakistan in 2014. The first five-wicket haul in an ODI on the ground was achieved by Chaminda Vaas who took 8/19 for Sri Lanka against Zimbabwe in 2001. this is the only time a bowler has taken eight wickets in an innings in any ODI on any ground.\nTest match five-wicket hauls.\nFive-wicket hauls have been taken a total of 52 times in Test matches on the ground.\nOne Day International five-wicket hauls.\nThere have been three five-wicket hauls taken on the ground in One Day Internationals, all of them in men's matches."

        "text": "The 1973 FIM Motocross World Championship was the 17th F.I.M. Motocross Racing World Championship season.\nSummary.\n500cc championship.\nRoger De Coster won his third consecutive 500cc world championship for Suzuki ahead of West German rider, Willy Bauer. The championship wasn't decided until the final race in the Netherlands, when Bauer suffered a mechanical breakdown, losing the championship to De Coster by two points. Kawasaki joined the world championships with Brad Lackey in the 500cc class and Torleif Hansen in the 250cc class.\nSuzuki's defense of the 500cc world championship was dealt a setback when, the FIM announced a new motorcycle minimum weight limit of 209 pounds just before the start of the season. European motorcycle manufacturers competing in the championship complained to the FIM that Suzuki was spending millions of dollars to build lightweight motorcycles that the smaller European manufacturers found impossible to compete with. Suzuki had already developed and built their race bikes so, there was no time to build new bikes. As a result, Suzuki resorted to adding ballast to the bikes. Unfortunately, these alterations threw the bikes out of balance and caused them to lose traction. To make matters worse, Maico and Yamaha had developed new rear suspensions with longer travel which helped transfer power to the rear wheel over rough terrain. The Suzuki management felt they were being unjustly treated by the FIM and were slow to react to developments by the other manufacturers.\nMost of the Western European riders boycotted the Austrian 500cc round due to heavy snow on the track. As the season got underway, Yamaha's new \"monoshock\" rear suspension began to make an impact with Christer Hammargren winning a moto and Jaak van Velthoven taking the overall win at the Finnish Grand Prix. De Coster won both motos of the Italian Grand Prix but, Bauer came back with a hard fought victory in Czechoslovakia, relegating De Coster to second place in both motos and took the lead in the championship points tally. Bauer then took control of the championship by winning 5 out of the next 6 motos. Suzuki management's frustration at their perceived unfair treatment led to a lapse in support and, Suzuki team riders De Coster and Sylvain Geboers then took matters into their own hands by modifying their motorcycle's frames and developed new rear suspensions.\nGoing into the final race of the season at Sint Anthonis, Holland, Bauer was still holding the points lead but, the Suzukis were showing improvement. The Sint Anthonis track was composed of deep sand which robbed engines of power and increased fuel consumption. A Suzuki engineer calculated that their bike's gas tanks did not have sufficient capacity to finish the race. De Coster then took one of their tanks and drove two and a half hours to have the tank modified to increase its volume. He then drove back in time for the race. Despite having little sleep, De Coster scored two fourth-place finishes while Bauer suffered a mechanical failure handing De Coster his third consecutive 500cc world championship.\n250cc championship.\nHåkan Andersson won the 250cc world championship to give Yamaha its first motocross world championship. Yamaha's new and innovative rear suspension with a single shock absorber made its debut at the third round in Belgium and was proven to be successful when Andersson won the overall victory. The new suspension design would go on to revolutionize the sport. Jim Pomeroy riding a privateer Bultaco, became the first American rider to win an overall victory in an FIM Motocross Grand Prix race when he won the season opening Spanish Grand Prix. His victory also marked the first Grand Prix victory for the Bultaco factory. Competitors from nine different manufacturers placed in the top ten of the 250cc championship final standings, reflecting the thriving vitality of the sport of motocross.\nFinal standings.\nPoints are awarded to the top 10 classified finishers.\n500cc.\nSources:\n250cc.\nSources:"

        "text": "Dannon Ross Atkins (born August 7, 1973) is an American baseball executive. On December 3, 2015, he was named the general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, the sixth in Toronto franchise history after having worked for the Cleveland Indians for 15 years.\nPlaying career.\nAtkins was a pitcher at Coral Gables Senior High School in Coral Gables, Florida, a city adjacent to Miami. After graduating in 1991, Atkins was a pitcher at Wake Forest University, and was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the 69th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. In 1993, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Yarmouth–Dennis Red Sox of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In the 1995 Major League Baseball draft, the Cleveland Indians selected him in the 38th round, and he signed with the team. He played 5 seasons in Cleveland's minor league organization before retiring, compiling a career 37–32 win–loss record, 4.13 earned run average (ERA), and 340 strikeouts in 512 innings pitched.\nExecutive career.\nCleveland Indians.\nThe Indians hired Atkins in 2001 as assistant director of player development, and was promoted to director of Latin American operations in 2003. In 2006, they promoted him to director of player development. The Indians promoted Atkins to vice president of player personnel after the 2014 season.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nMark Shapiro, who was hired as the Blue Jays' team president and CEO on October 31, 2015, hired Atkins as general manager on December 3. He replaced Tony LaCava, who served as interim GM in November. During the offseason leading into the 2016 season, Atkins made several moves, including selecting Joe Biagini in the Rule 5 draft, trading Ben Revere to the Washington Nationals for Drew Storen, and signing several players to minor league contracts with invitations to spring training. In his first draft as GM, Atkins selected T. J. Zeuch in the first round. Atkins made several additions to the Blue Jays roster prior to the trade deadline, acquiring Melvin Upton Jr., Joaquín Benoit, Scott Feldman, Francisco Liriano, and others, which aided the Blue Jays in making the postseason for the second consecutive season with an 89-73 record.\nAtkins' second season was a disappointing one for the Jays. They finished 76-86 despite early season hopes of a third consecutive playoff berth. The 2018 season saw more of the same, as the Jays stumbled to a 73-89 record and a second straight season out of the postseason leading to Atkins beginning a rebuild of the roster.\nOn April 7, 2021, the Blue Jays organization announced they had signed Atkins to a five year contract extension, through the end of the 2026 season."

It is a -story building executed in the Tudor Revival style. The primary facade features a distinctive composition of three asymmetrically concentric gables with gridded false timbering and tinted stucco panels atop a large bay window.\nOf particular note was the use of early experimental Kodacolor motion picture film to document the process of construction. The captured moments were organized into a brief presentation for the public who visited the home during its four-week open house.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 24, 2015."

This took place from 14 to 20 December 2015.\nIn an agreement with the United States Tennis Association and the French Tennis Federation, Tennis Australia gives one man and one woman from the United States and France each a wildcard into the Australian Open. The French players were chosen by internal selection, while USTA awarded the entry to the player with the most points over three pre-selected events in USA over October and November 2015.\nSince the Australian Open is promoted as the \"Grand Slam of Asia/Pacific\", one male and one female player from this geographical area were awarded a wildcard. This was decided through the Asia-Pacific Australian Open Wildcard Playoff. At the same event, one male and one female doubles team won wildcards, and one wildcard each was contested in boys and girls singles. This took place from 2 to 6 December 2015.\nRemaining wildcards were awarded by internal Australian selection.\nFor the first time, a new initiative was put in place for rewarding women's wildcards. A wildcard race was put in place by Tennis Australia to offer the highest Australian points earner from the 2015 Canberra Tennis International and 2015 Bendigo Women's International a main draw wildcard. The singles wildcard was won by Tammi Patterson and the doubles wildcard was won by Jessica Moore and Storm Sanders. Also for the first time, the winner of the girls' 18 and under national championships was rewarded a main draw wildcard.\nAsia-Pacific Wildcard Playoff.\nThe Asia-Pacific Wildcard Playoff events took place in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China from Monday, November 30 to Sunday, December 6, 2015. A total of 26 male and 30 female players from Asia/Pacific zone took part in singles events (including qualifying competitions), with Yoshihito Nishioka from Japan and Han Xinyun from China gaining the Australian Open entry. Both doubles events consisted of 18 male and 19 female teams, with Hsieh Cheng-peng &amp; Yang Tsung-hua and Shuko Aoyama &amp; Makoto Ninomiya winning the wild cards.

This Showdown included the Wildcard Playoff as well as 18/u, 16/u, 14/u and 12/u National Championships. The men's wildcard playoff was won by top seed James Duckworth who defeated Benjamin Mitchell in the final by a walkover. Mitchell was forced to pull out of the final to be in Brisbane with his partner whom was due to give birth. The women's wildcard playoff was won by unseeded teen Maddison Inglis, who defeated newlywed Arina Rodionova in the final.\nWomen's singles.\nNB: Kimberly Birrell was the number 5 seed, but withdrew prior to the commencement of play.\nGirls' singles.\nFor the first time in Australian Open history, the winner of the girls' 18/U Championships will receive a main draw wildcard into the 2016 Australian Open. The wildcard was won by top seed Priscilla Hon who defeated wildcard playoff winner Maddison Inglis in the final.\nNB: Kimberly Birrell was the number 2 seed.\nMixed doubles.\nThe 'Win a Wildcard' competition held by Tennis Australia allowed any person over the age of 16 entry into the competition.

        "text": "Test cricket is the oldest form of cricket played at international level. A Test match is scheduled to take place over a period of five days, and is played by teams representing full member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nThis is a list of West Indies Test cricket records. It is based on the List of Test cricket records, but concentrates solely on records dealing with the West Indian Test cricket team, and any cricketers who have played for that team.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, draws and ties and the partnership records.

If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nGreatest win margins (by innings).\nThe fifth Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The Oval saw England win by an innings and 579 runs, the largest victory by an innings in Test cricket history.

He took 29 catches during the 2013 Ashes series. West Indiesn record is held by Deryck Murray when he made 24 dismissals during the West Indies tour of England in 1963.\nFielding records.\nMost career catches.\nCaught is one of the nine methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket.

The oldest West Indian Test player is George Headley who was aged 44 years and 230 days when he represented West Indies for the final time in the 1954 tour by England at Sabina Park.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership.

        "text": "One Day International (ODI) cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) as well as the top four Associate members. Unlike Test matches, ODIs consist of one inning per team, having a limit in the number of overs, currently 50 overs per innings – although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs. ODI cricket is List-A cricket, so statistics and records set in ODI matches also count toward List-A records. The earliest match recognised as an ODI was played between England and Australia in January 1971; since when there have been over 4,000 ODIs played by 28 teams. \nThis is a list of Zimbabwe Cricket team's One Day International records. It is based on the List of One Day International cricket records, but concentrates solely on records dealing with the Zimbabwe cricket team. Zimbabwe played its first ever ODI in 1983.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, draws and ties, all round records and the partnership records. Tied records for fifth place are also included. Explanations of the general symbols and cricketing terms used in the list are given below.

Prior to signing with the team at his initial meeting with Cardinals coaching staff, he brought pound cakes homemade by his mother as an apology for missing his scheduled flight - this earned Jackson the nickname \"Pound Cake\" that stayed with him throughout his professional career. He was released on August 31, 2015 after competing in the 2015 Cardinals' preseason games.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nOn December 8, 2015, Jackson was signed to the practice squad of the Indianapolis Colts.

Just before 4 a.m., the two men exited the vehicle along the westbound lanes of Interstate 70 in Indianapolis. While on the shoulder, Jackson and Monroe were struck by a Ford F-150 pickup truck, which veered into the emergency lane. Both Jackson and Monroe died at the scene. The driver, Manuel Orrego-Savala, 37, of Guatemala, was arrested after trying to flee the scene on foot, according to the Indiana State Police. Orrego-Savala was in the country illegally, having already been deported on two occasions, in 2007 and 2009.\nAuthorities reported that Orrego-Savala was driving without a license and had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.239, nearly three times the legal limit of 0.08 to drive in Indiana.\nInitially identifying himself to police as Alex Cabrera-Gonsales, he had previously been convicted of drunk driving in California in 2005.\nOn February 7, 2018, Manuel Orrego-Savala was charged by the Marion County prosecutor with four felony counts: two counts of causing death while operating a vehicle above the legal alcohol limit, and two counts of failing to remain at the scene of an accident. The previous day, he was charged in federal court with illegal re-entry of a previously deported person.\nOn September 21, 2018, Manuel Orrego-Savala was sentenced to the maximum of 16 years in prison after pleading guilty on July 20, 2018 to two counts of operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of 0.15 or more, causing death."

        "title": "Golf in Ireland",
        "text": "Golf in Ireland dates to at least the mid-19th century, with the Royal Curragh Golf Club (the first golf club in Ireland) being founded in 1858. The two \"oldest governing bodies in world golf\", the Golfing Union of Ireland (GUI) and the Irish Ladies Golf Union (ILGU), were formed in 1891 and 1893 respectively. By 2008, the GUI had 166,419 members and the ILGU had 49,822 members, making them the third and seventh largest sports associations by membership base in Ireland. Operating as separate (men's and ladies') unions for over 120 years, the two entities formed a combined organisation, Golf Ireland, which ratified its first board in early 2021.\nAs of the 21st century, golf is among the most-played sports in the country, with a 2008 report for the Irish Sports Council indicating that golf was then the fourth most popular sport by participation rate. As of 2009, Ireland reportedly had the fourth most golf courses per capita in the world, and a 2012 Fáilte Ireland report stated that overseas visitors to the country spent €183m on golfing activities.\nHistory of golf in Ireland.\nEarly development.\nGolf in the modern world originated from a game played on the eastern coast of Scotland during the 15th century. The game later spread throughout the (then) British Empire, including to Ireland. While golf may have been played near Bray in County Wicklow during the 1760s, the game in Ireland largely developed during the mid-19th century, when a number of courses were built. One of the oldest and most popular at this time was the Royal Curragh Golf Club, which was founded in 1858.\nFormation of amateur organisations.\nThe Golfing Union of Ireland (GUI) was established in 1891, making it the oldest national golfing union in the world. Based at Carton House, Maynooth, as of 2018, it represented 430 golf clubs and 170,000 members.\nThe Irish Ladies' Golf Union (ILGU) was founded in 1893, just two years after the GUI, and is recognised as the \"oldest Ladies Golf Union in the world\". Based at Sandyford in Dublin, as of 2008 the ILGU had almost 50,000 members.\nFollowing a consultation process which commenced in 2015, and after separate votes by representatives of both the GUI and ILGU, the two \"oldest governing bodies in world golf\" agreed to form a new joint governing organisation for golf in Ireland. The new combined body, \"Golf Ireland\", held its first general meeting (and ratified its first board and association president) in February 2021.\nProfessional and other organisations.\nThe Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland) was founded in 1901 and is based out of The Belfry, England. It was established to professionalise careers in golf and grow the golf community in Great Britain and Ireland. The Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) initially included 70 members, later growing to over 7,500.\nThe Confederation of Golf in Ireland is an umbrella body, formed by the GUI, ILGU and the PGA, to \"help advance the sport of golf on the island of Ireland\".\nTournaments.\nThe Irish PGA Championship has been held annually at many of the nation's courses since its founding in 1907. It is the oldest tournament in Ireland. The Irish Open is a professional tournament established in 1927. It was revived in 1975 and is now on the European Tour and a qualifying event for the Open Championship. The Irish Amateur Open Championship is a 72-hole stroke play event established in 1892 by the Golfing Union of Ireland. It has been held at the Royal Dublin Golf Club since 2007. The Irish Senior Open is a 54-hole stroke play event in the European Seniors Tour. It was established in 1997. The Volopa Irish Challenge was established in 2015 and is a tournament on the Challenge Tour.\nNotable courses.\nThere are around 300 different courses on the island of Ireland. Around the entire coast of Ireland are links-style golf courses, played on sandy soils with firm conditions, often with views of the sea while inland there is a wide variety of parkland courses more usually containing trees and water hazards.\nThere are a number of historic courses in Ireland, whether that be tournament hosting history such as Portmarnock in the Dublin region, which was home to fifteen Irish Opens or Royal Portrush in County Antrim, the only course in Ireland to have held The Open Championship. A number of other clubs and courses were established in the 19th century such as the Royal Curragh Golf Club in Kildare (1858) and Lahinch Golf Club in County Clare (1894). Below is a list of some of the notable courses in Ireland;\nNotable golfers.\nPádraig Harrington was the first golfer from Ireland to win The Open Championship. Shane Lowry won The Open Championship 2019 at Royal Portrush. Other notable Irish golfers include: Darren Clarke, Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell, Alexander William Shaw (founder of Lahinch and Limerick golf clubs), Rhona Adair (who contributed to the first American book on golfing for women entitled \"Golf for Women\" in 1904), Philomena Garvey (who won the British Ladies Amateur competition in 1957), and Paddy Skerritt (winner of the 1970 Alcan International).\nIrish golfers.\nOther Irish golfers, to have won major amateur championships, professional tour competitions, or have competed for Ireland in the World Cup include:"

In his first season on the main tour he won his first competitive match 5–2 against Dessie Sheehan, but earned only £984 in prize money, at the 1986 Classic, where he lost 4–5 to Perrie Mans in the last 64.\nBeginning the 1986/1987 season ranked 94th, he lost 5–0 to Tony Jones in the Grand Prix - earning £150, his only prize money this season, in doing so - and reached the last 48 at the English Professional Championship, where Les Dodd beat him 6–3.\nHowever, the following season brought runs to the last-32 stage of two tournaments; at the 1987 UK Championship, he defeated Frank Jonik, Paddy Browne and Doug Mountjoy before losing 8–9 to John Campbell, and in the English Professional Championship, he recorded a 6–1 win over Graham Miles prior to losing 5–6 to Dave Martin.\nThese performances enhanced Smith's ranking to 72nd, a career best, and further positive results came during 1988/1989; he reached the last-16 in a non-ranking tournament, with victories over Mick Price and Ken Owers, losing at that stage 1–5 to Craig Edwards.\nAt the 1989 International Open, he defeated Dennis Hughes, Martin and veteran Rex Williams to reach the last 32 for the second time in his career, but again, he lost at this stage, 3–5 to Steve James.\nSeveral last-64 finishes followed from 1990 to 1992, and during the 1992/1993 season, he played in only three tournaments. Having lost to the young prospect Stephen Lee in the UK Championship, he entered the 1993 World Championship, but was eliminated 1–5 in qualifying by Darren Guest. Concluding the season ranked 114th, he was relegated from the tour immediately thereafter."

The greens were officially opened in April 1896 by club president John Forrest, the Premier of Western Australia.\nWestern Australian Tattersalls Club.\nSeveral attempts were made in the 1880s and 1890s were made to start up a Tattersalls Club in Perth before the Western Australian Tattersalls Club was established in 1901, with the Club formally registered as a company in 1903.\nMerger.\nThe two clubs agreed to merge in late 1978, with an act of parliament required to approve the merger.\nVenues.\nSoon after the bowling club was founded, work began on building a facility to the north of the Perth Esplanade.\nAs time went on, with the widening of Riverside Drive and the ongoing reclamation of the Swan River, a move east of the Esplanade began to be suggested.\nDuring the 1960s, the club took over facilities on Plain Street, East Perth that had originally been built for the 1962 Commonwealth Games, but not used."

Smith, Robert Barr Smith, William Gilbert, and A. H. Grainger were also among the founding members and supporters.\nThe first green was established on a plot behind Government House, North Terrace. Its location was later an impediment to a plan by the Adelaide City Council to extend Kintore Avenue through to Victoria Drive, and so provide another exit from the city and so reduce traffic congestion. For this reason, the club was moved to its present location in 1958.\nThe Club now has its premises within Rymill Park in the eastern parklands, with the entrance off Dequetteville Terrace."

        "title": "Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse",
        "text": "Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse is a heritage-listed club house at 1 Goondoon Street, Gladstone Central, Gladstone, Gladstone Region, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Philip Hanman and built from 1949 to 1959. It is also known as Gladstone Yacht Club. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 June 2009.\nHistory.\nThe Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse was constructed between 1949 and 1959 by members of the Port Curtis Sailing Club. The club was formed in 1941 by the sailing fraternity of Gladstone to provide facilities and support for the sport, as well as a venue for social functions. While renovations were undertaken to the building in recent years, the core of the post-war building remains as a landmark on Auckland Inlet. The clubhouse evolved from an initial concept as a single-storeyed boat storage facility to a double-storeyed building with boat storage underneath and an entertainment and dining venue above. The clubhouse is known Australia-wide for its association with the Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race, the finish of which is hosted by the Port Curtis Sailing Club. This race has been a highlight of the Australian sailing calendar since its inauguration in 1949 and was the first ocean race held in Queensland.\nSailing clubs for both recreation and competitive sport have been active in Queensland since the late nineteenth century, including: Brisbane Sailing Club (established 1885), Fitzroy Sailing Club at Rockhampton (1895), Sandgate Yacht Club (1897), Townsville Yacht Club (1901), Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron (1902), Oxley Sailing Club (1902), South Brisbane Sailing Club (1903); Cleveland Yacht Club (1904), and Cairns Yacht Club (1908). New clubs formed after World War Two and many new and existing clubs began building clubhouses at this time. The Townsville club credits the post-war Olympic Games for a renewed interest in sailing, while others suggest returned servicemen seeking adventure and camaraderie led to the formation of new clubs. In terms of social regattas, it is likely that the improved economy, growth in car ownership and improved roads allowed sailors to tow their boats to compete in regattas around the State. It is clear that many clubs utilised remnant war-time buildings to create clubhouses and most, like Port Curtis Sailing Club, took advantage of member's skills, enthusiasm and business contacts in the construction process.\nSailing and rowing were popular activities on the Gladstone harbour (Port Curtis). Regattas were often held on Separation Day (10 December) in the 1870s. By 1890 regattas were held annually on Easter Monday. These were the forerunners of the more recent Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race held over the Easter weekend. Rowing was also popular on the harbour. Twenty four people with an interest in rowing or sailing met on 3 April 1941 at Feros' Paramount Cafe and formed the Port Curtis Aquatic Club. Shortly after that the club sought permission from the Gladstone Harbour Board to place a set of rails in Auckland Creek for launching and retrieving boats. The war led to a downturn in sailing activities, but the club reformed in 1946. Members quickly realised that sailing was the main interest so on 3 September 1947 it was renamed the Port Curtis Sailing Club. Fund raising to build a clubhouse commenced and the club asked the Gladstone Harbour Board for a site. In July 1948 the Gladstone Town Council agreed to grant the remainder of the Reserve for Baths (between the baths and Auckland Inlet) to the Gladstone Harbour Board, provided the council could continue to access the drainage pipes for the baths. The baths which had been built by the council in 1936 were situated at the corner of Goondoon and Lord Streets. By granting the remainder of the reserve to the Harbour Board, the council was in essence, providing a site for the sailing club on the harbour front.\nIn 1948 the Queensland Cruising Yacht Club (QCYC) approached the Port Curtis Sailing Club with a proposal to establish a race between Brisbane and Gladstone. This was to be the first ocean racing event in Queensland. Gladstone Mayor Jack O'Malley was enthusiastic about the proposal, although he had little local support initially. The sailing club began planning for the event, with a particular focus on the finish of the race which was to be at the Auckland Point Jetty. Six weeks prior to the event, Gladstone was hit by a destructive cyclone. The sailing club still wanted to proceed with building a club house and wrote to the Harbour Board in March 1949 seeking clarification of the dimensions of the land it intended to lease to the club for its clubhouse. In April 1949 the club made a request to the Gladstone Town Council for number of substantial trees knocked over by the cyclone on Council land. Council agreed and these trees were used in the construction of a clubhouse.\nThe inaugural Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race was held at Easter 1949. No Gladstone yachts participated in the race although a number of locals crewed on the winning boats. Despite particularly heavy weather, the race was deemed a success and plans were made by the Port Curtis Sailing Club and the QCYC to ensure it was an annual event. As local interest in sailing grew, so did the need for a Gladstone club house. In 1950 a resurvey was undertaken of the Gladstone baths (R.270, Portion 22) and the land between the baths and Auckland Inlet. The latter was to be the site of the Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse, but vested as a Reserve for Harbour Purposes (R.301, Portion 119).\nClub members continued to procure more trees felled during the 1949 cyclone, this time from local graziers with family interests in the club. Members were involved in the long process of milling the logs. In 1953 land was reclaimed for a clubhouse. The fill came from Auckland Hill, which had been successively excavated for fill over the years, particularly in the 1950s. Locals drew up a basic design for the clubhouse, initially for a single-storeyed boat and gear shed. When extra timber was procured, architect Phil Hanman refined the plans to include two storeys with a dance hall on the top floor. While the initial funds were raised through debentures, the construction of the dance hall was specifically to provide an income stream for the club. Other fundraising means included art unions, dances, socials and door knocking for donations.\nThe Gladstone Port Authority lent the club a pile driver and timber piles were driven into the reclaimed land to depths ranging between . In 1954 the piles were capped with concrete and the construction of the frame work began. All work was done by volunteer labour and supervised by professional tradesmen. Building materials were sourced through a number of means including donations from local businesses. Construction was inhibited by post-war building material regulations, in which all available materials were destined for housing. At first, permission was only granted to build and roof the lower storey, with the upper floor waiting until material shortages eased. One section of the building was completed by 3 May 1955 and club members were able to move in.\nIn November 1957 the Gladstone Harbour Board wrote to the local Land Commissioner stating that the Sailing Club Building was in fact beyond the official boundary of the reserve, towards Auckland Inlet. The boundaries were then extended by an Order in Council on 19 June 1958, without re-surveying. The sailing club building was completed by the chairman of the Gladstone Harbour Board, local councillor and builder, Mr W R Golding MBE. The official opening was held on the evening of 28 March 1959 in time for the Easter Regatta.\nThe Port Curtis Sailing Club's clubhouse was erected during a period of expanded interest in amateur sailing in Queensland after World War Two. At least eleven clubhouses have been identified as being constructed for Queensland sailing/yacht clubs in the 1940s and 1950s and like Port Curtis Sailing Club premises, most utilised donated materials and labour: Sandgate Skiff Club (1944), Southport Sailing Club (1946), Sandgate Sailing Club (1948), Townsville Sailing Club (1948), Maryborough Sailing Club (1950), North Queensland Cruising Yacht Club (1952), Oxley (1953), Bulimba (1953), South Brisbane (1956), Darling Point (1958) and Port Curtis (1959). Sandgate Skiff Club relocated a former church hall to its Cabbage Tree Creek site, near to where the Sandgate Yacht Club had reconstructed old army huts into the Sandgate Memorial Boat Shed in 1948 (later handed over to the Queensland Cruising Yacht Club). Maryborough Sailing Club initially used an old World War Two Navy boatshed and built a clubhouse beside it in 1950, using new and recycled materials. The North Queensland Cruising Yacht Club in Bowen relocated a former WRAAF Mess Hall and like Port Curtis, raised money through debentures for the 1952 project. The Oxley Sailing Club had been given a parcel of riverfront land. Timber was donated in 1951 for the first boat shed which was completed by club members in June 1953. Bulimba Sailing Club volunteers built its clubhouse in 1953 and raised the building later to accommodate boat storage. South Brisbane Sailing Club was given a lease in Orleigh Park, and the clubhouse was built by volunteer labour in 1956. Darling Point was built by club members in 1958.\nOnly six of the eleven post-war clubhouses remain: Oxley, South Brisbane, Darling Point (relocated to Manly Breakwater in 1978), Sandgate, Bulimba and Port Curtis. It appears that Port Curtis Sailing Club is the only extant clubhouse from the 1940s and 1950s to have used an architect in its design. Architect Phil Hanman, who designed the upper floor, had served with club vice president Doug Patrick in the Middle East during World War Two.\nAt Gladstone, the Harbour Board continued to reclaim land and in February 1967 the boundaries of R.301 (which included the sailing club site) were amended to reflect this reclamation. On 14 December 1967, R.301 was cancelled and Portion 119 was vested with the Gladstone Harbour Board. The sailing club then negotiated with the Gladstone Harbour Board for a lease on the clubhouse site for up to 75 years.\nTo gain a liquor licence during the mid 1970s an association was formed between the sailing club, the Port Curtis Air Sea Rescue, and the Gladstone Power Boat Club, to create the Gladstone Yacht Club as an entity. The air sea rescue and boating club are no longer associated with the yacht club which is now the trading name for the Port Curtis Sailing Club Inc.\nThe Port Curtis Sailing Club installed a pontoon sometime in the 1980s. In the 1990s the clubhouse was extended and upgraded including the addition of an open veranda on the north-east side, an extension on the north-west, and a new licensed bar area in part of the original ball room facing Auckland Creek, which was opened up with a glass front. A large verandah was added to the western side which included a restaurant. The project was designed by architect Allan Jeffery who assured the club that the original 1950s building would last for many more years and was a credit to the local volunteer builders. These new extensions were formally opened on 13 September 1997.\nThe Port Curtis Sailing Club has been proactive in organising a number of significant sailing activities and events in Queensland. In 1960 the club commenced \"learn to sail\" classes for local children and in 1961 it purchased ten sabots and initiated the South Queensland Sabot Association. It then negotiated with the Gladstone State High School to run the first sailing classes in Queensland High Schools. The Port Curtis Sailing Club provided the boats and the expertise. 1961 was also the year of the first Harbour Festival which was organised by the club to entertain spectators waiting for the yachts to arrive in the Brisbane to Gladstone race. The festival continues to be an annual event, though now organised through the local council. The club has also organised a wide range of ocean racing events including the Gladstone to Bowen, Gladstone to Bundaberg, Gladstone to Cairns, Gladstone to Great Keppel and Gladstone to Hamilton Island. Another first was claimed by club member Lesley Barker who was sailing mistress for the first all girl crew in the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in 1975. Club stalwart and foundation member Noel Patrick won the Brisbane to Gladstone on five occasions in his boat Wistari. He also published the first sailing directory for the Port Curtis region Cruising the Curtis Coast in 1986.\nThe Port Curtis Sailing Club has always been part of the organisational team involved in managing the finish of the Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race. Other organisations involved include the Gladstone Volunteer Marine Rescue, Gladstone Harbour Festival Committee, Gladstone Port Corporation, Gladstone Marina, Gladstone Mayor's office and interested local citizens. While the formal trophy presentations have been held at various locations over the 60 year history of the race, including the Town Hall, O'Connell Wharf and the clubhouse, the social activities have always occurred at the Port Curtis Sailing Club. The Club is open 24 hours a day during the Easter weekend in order to welcome sailing crews as they arrive. A plotting room is set up in the sail training room on the ground floor providing public access to the progress of the race. Electronic monitoring is managed at the adjacent Volunteer Marine Rescue headquarters.\nIn November 2008 the Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race was awarded the first prize in the \"festival and events\" category at the Queensland Tourism Awards. The race now generates festivals in Redcliffe (Festival of Sails) and Gladstone (Harbour Festival) and is recognised as a significant ocean racing event in Australia, second only to the Sydney to Hobart race. For race participants, it is known as \"the friendly race\", and the camaraderie amongst participants is what draws competitors back annually. The clubhouse was also awarded the Best Small Social Club in 2007 and 2008 in the Clubs Queensland Achievement Awards. The importance of the clubhouse to the race was summed up in 1983 by the Commodore, Julian Walker, who commented prior to the race: \"Port Curtis Sailing Club is gearing up to make you feel welcome and give you an atmosphere in which to swap yarns and tall stories.\"\nDescription.\nThe Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse marks the northern end of Goondoon Street, Gladstone's main street, where the land slopes towards Gladstone Harbour. It forms part of a series of maritime structures at the mouth of Auckland Inlet including the Port Authority boat ramp, the O'Connell Wharf to the north, the Volunteer Marine Rescue Gladstone building and a recently constructed Customs building. It is located on largely flat ground overlooking the boat ramp towards the harbour.\nThe Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse is a timber-framed structure which has been altered and extended since its completion in 1959. The 1950s structure forms the core of the existing building and various extensions have taken place around its perimeter. The building has a large hipped roof clad with galvanised metal sheeting with the main ridge finishing at gablets at either end. At the north-western end the hipped roof extends lower to form a balcony space. A two storey section has been added along the main north-eastern elevation. On the opposite side of the building a large deck with a curved roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting has been added. A two-storeyed kitchen wing has also been added behind the new deck space.\nThe main elevation, which faces to the north-east, features a protruding entry area and a parapet wall which extends for most of the length of the building. These are formed from timber sheeting. Narrow lengths of corrugated metal sheeting have been fixed to form column- like details within the parapet wall, framing each end and the entry area. The exterior is clad with chamferboards at the base with fibre- cement sheeting with timber cover strips to the remainder. A cantilevered street awning is located above the entry area with \"Port Curtis Sailing Club\" in lettering fixed along its front edge and \"Gladstone Yacht Club\" in lettering adjacent to the entry door. Narrow window hoods cover each of the window bays. Timber casement windows are located above the street awning. A verandah space on the upper level has exposed steel posts and balustrades with a small enclosed area clad with fibre-cement sheeting. Recent aluminium windows are located adjacent to the entry on the second level and on the lower level.\nOn the north-west elevation which overlooks the boat ramp and Auckland Inlet is a recently added enclosed balcony space supported on cantilevered tapered steel beams. The balcony is roofed with a skillion roof which extends from the hipped main roof and is enclosed with fixed and sliding glass panels. Adjacent to the balcony space is a recent outdoor dining area with a steel framed curved roof. The undercroft area below the outdoor dining area is open.\nThe lower level of the building is enclosed with fibre cement sheeting with chamferboards at the base. Openings are varied throughout the building and include metal roller-doors, aluminium framed sliding and hopper windows, louvre windows. A recent kitchen extension has been added to the rear south-western corner of the building which has a hipped roof and is clad with fibre cement on the upper floor and enclosed with blockwork on the lower level.\nThe building consists of various dining and bar areas on the upper floor with storage for boats and catering equipment on the lower level. The two levels are linked by an early stairwell which remains largely intact and is reached from a small foyer/entry area adjacent to the main entry. A new office has been constructed in the foyer area. The upper floor has been divided into a central lounge bar, balcony dining area and function room. The verandah space to the north-east has been enclosed to form a games room. A new outdoor dining area is located behind the lounge bar to the west.\nThe lower floor of the building is largely open for storage with early timber stumps visible. A training room has been enclosed in the north- east corner and a catering storage area formed by blockwork in the southern corner.\nThe upper floor has walls lined with vertically fixed painted chamferboards and plasterboard sheeting. The ceiling is lined with plasterboard with some recessed ceiling panels visible. Floors are lined with recent linoleum strip sheeting with carpet in some areas. The internal stairwell has walls lined with long lengths of chamferboards and fibre cement sheeting with cover strips. The staircase has treads and risers of polished timber and balustrades with timber cappings. The balcony space has walls and ceilings lined with plasterboard. On the lower floor walls and ceilings are generally unlined with some early louvre windows visible which are hidden behind cladding on the outside.\nThe grounds include lawned boat-rigging areas adjacent to the concrete boat ramp to the north of the clubhouse and bitumened carparks in front of the building (fronting Goondoon Street) and at its rear to the west. A white, painted steel flagpole is located to the north. There is a recent pontoon extending into Auckland Inlet, but this sits outside the heritage boundary.\nHeritage listing.\nPort Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 June 2009 having satisfied the following criteria.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\nThe Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse, constructed between 1949 and 1959 on Auckland Inlet at Gladstone, is important in illustrating part of the pattern of Queensland's history, namely the development of the sport of sailing in Queensland.\nThe place is important for its close association with the annual Easter-weekend Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race, inaugurated in 1949 and second only to the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in terms of significance in Australian ocean racing. The race was awarded first prize in the \"festival and events\" category at the Queensland Tourism Awards in 2008. The Port Curtis Sailing Club has played an integral role in the management of the race since its inception, and its clubhouse remains an iconic venue for end-of-the-race celebrations by participants, organisers and spectators alike. A plotting room set up in the sail training room on the ground floor of the clubhouse provides public access to the progress of the race, and the clubhouse has been the venue for the presentation of race trophies.\nThe Club also has been credited with initiating the South Queensland Sabot Association and being the first in Queensland to offer sail training as a high school subject, activities that were based at the clubhouse.\nThe clubhouse remains one of the earlier sailing club facilities on the Queensland coast. The 1950s core of the clubhouse survives, with undercroft boat storage and sail training room, and a former dance hall on the upper level.\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\nThe Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse is significant for its special association with the Australian sailing community as the principal venue for the celebration of the end of the annual Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race, and as a past venue for the presentation of race trophies."

This came after events at Geoff King Motors Oval in 2013 where a match involving Coffs Harbour Comets was abandoned following a wild melee in the 61st minute.\nGroup 2's chief administrator Jim Anderson said Macleay Valley's lower grades sides would not take part in the semi-finals series of 2013 due to the incidents.\n2014.\nThe Macleay Valley club was again excluded, this time from Group 3 ahead of the 2015 season. They were found guilty of breaching the group's code of conduct and the National Rugby League code of conduct during the season. This was despite having beaten Wauchope in the Grand Final 25-24.\n2019.\nMacleay Valley won its third premiership in seven years, defeating Wauchope again in the Grand Final."

        "title": "Minor League Baseball",
        "text": "Minor League Baseball (MiLB) is a professional baseball organization below Major League Baseball (MLB), including teams affiliated with MLB clubs.\nEntering the 2021 season, the number of full-season MLB-affiliated minor leagues with teams in the United States and Canada was reduced to 11, with a total of 120 teams (four per each of the 30 MLB franchises). There are also two affiliated rookie leagues based in the United States, with teams based at the parent clubs' spring training complexes in Arizona and Florida, and one affiliated rookie league in the Dominican Republic.\nOrganization.\nAs of the 2022 season, the minor league system is divided into four classes: Triple-A (AAA), Double-A (AA), High-A (A+), and Single-A (A). Major League Baseball franchises may also maintain one or two complex-based rookie teams in the Arizona Complex League or Florida Complex League, and international summer baseball teams in the Dominican Summer League. While major league teams play a 162-game schedule, minor league seasons are shorter. , a complete season in Triple-A is 150 games, Double-A is 138 games, and High-A and Single-A are each 132 games.\nTriple-A.\nThis classification currently includes two affiliated leagues: the 20-team International League and the 10-team Pacific Coast League, known as Triple-A East and Triple-A West, respectively, for the 2021 season. For most of the 20th century, Triple-A also included the American Association, based in the Midwest, but that league disbanded with its clubs absorbed by the other two leagues, as part of a reorganization of the Triple-A level in 1997. The International League features teams from the Atlantic coast and midwestern U.S., while the Pacific Coast League features teams from the Pacific coast and the southwest.\nBoth young players and veterans play for Triple-A teams. Parent clubs often hold players who are on the 40-man roster, but not on the active MLB roster, at the Triple-A level. Such players are eligible to be added to a team's active major league roster. For teams in contention for a pennant late in a season, it gives them fresh players, while for teams not in contention, it gives them an opportunity to evaluate their second-tier players against major league competition. Some Triple-A players are \"career minor leaguers\", former prospects whose skill growth has halted and who are not likely to advance to MLB, unless as a temporary replacement.\nDouble-A.\nThere are currently three leagues in this classification: the 12-team Eastern League, known as Double-A Northeast for the 2021 season, with teams in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., the eight-team Southern League (known as Double-A South for the 2021 season), with teams in the Deep South, and the 10-team Texas League, known as Double-A Central for the 2021 season, with teams in the Southwest and Great Plains.\nSome players jump to the majors from this level, as many of the top prospects are put here to play against each other rather than against minor and major league veterans in Triple-A. A small handful of players might be placed here to start, usually veterans from foreign leagues with more experience in professional baseball. The expectation is usually that these veteran players will be in the majors by the end of the season, as their salaries tend to be higher than those of most prospects.\nHigh-A.\nOne level below Double-A is the High-A level, named \"Class A-Advanced\" before 2021. This classification has three leagues: the 12-team Midwest League, known as High-A Central for the 2021 season, covering the Midwest, the six-team Northwest League, known as High-A West for the 2021 season, with teams in the Pacific Northwest, and the 12-team South Atlantic League, known as High-A East for the 2021 season, with teams in the eastern states. All three leagues were reclassified prior to the 2021 season, with the Midwest League and the South Atlantic League promoted from Single-A and the Northwest League promoted from Class A Short Season.\nThis level of play is often a second or third promotion for a minor league player, although some high first-round draftees, particularly those with experience playing college baseball, begin at this level.\nSingle-A.\nBelow the High-A level is Single-A, named \"Class A\" before 2021, when it was also known as Single-A or Full-Season A, and \"Low-A\" for the 2021 season. This classification has three leagues: the 8-team California League, known as Low-A West for the 2021 season, located entirely in California, the 12-team Carolina League, known as Low-A East for the 2021 season, and the 10-team Florida State League, known as Low-A Southeast for the 2021 season. All three leagues were demoted from High-A to Single-A effective with the 2021 season.\nThese leagues are a mix of players moving up from Rookie leagues, as well as the occasional experienced first-year player. Most of the teams in the Florida State League are owned by major league parent clubs and use their spring training complexes.\nIn 2022, the official name of the class became Single-A.\nRookie.\nMinor leagues with the Rookie classification play a shortened season that traditionally began in mid-June and ended in late August or early September. This lowest level of minor league baseball consists of two US-based leagues, the Arizona Complex League and Florida Complex League, known as the Arizona League and Gulf Coast League, respectively, before 2021, and one Caribbean-based league, the Dominican Summer League.\nThe U.S.-based Rookie leagues play a schedule of approximately 60 games and are named \"complex leagues\" because games are played at their parent clubs' spring training complexes. Rosters consist primarily of newly drafted players who are not yet ready for a higher level of play. These leagues are intended almost exclusively to allow players to hone their skills; no admission is charged and no concessions are sold.\nFor the 2024 season, the Arizona Complex League and Florida Complex League seasons will commence in early May and conclude in late July in order to provide players with previous experience in the Dominican Summer League with a full season in stateside professional baseball without having to compete for playing time with newly drafted players selected in the July Major League Baseball draft. This adjusted schedule will also allow the top Rookie-level prospects in each organization to be promoted to class Single-A for the final two months of the professional baseball season upon the conclusion of the complex league seasons.\nRoster sizes and player restrictions.\nAs of the 2024 season, each major league club may have no more than 165 players assigned to the rosters of their domestic affiliates (i.e., Triple-A, Double-A, High-A, Single-A, and complex-league Rookie)—excluding international players assigned to the Dominican Summer League who have not yet been assigned to a domestic affiliate, as well as players placed on the minor league 60-day and full-season injured lists—during the minor league season, with a limit of 175 domestic players during the offseason. During the minor league season, the following roster limits for each classification are used:\nLeagues and affiliations.\nMinor leagues.\nTriple-A\nDouble-A\nHigh-A\nSingle-A \nRookie\nOff-season leagues\nPartner leagues\nEarly history.\nThe earliest professional baseball league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players of 1871 to 1875, commonly referred to as the National Association, comprised all fully professional teams. This system proved unworkable, however, as there was no way to ensure competitive balance, and financially unsound clubs often failed in midseason. This problem was solved in 1876 with the formation of the National League (NL), with a limited membership which excluded less competitive and financially weaker teams. Professional clubs outside the NL responded by forming regional associations of their own. There was a series of \"ad hoc\" groupings, such as the New England Association of 1877 and the Eastern Championship Association of 1881. These were loose groups of independent clubs which agreed to play a series of games over the course of one season for a championship pennant.\nThe first true minor league is traditionally considered to be the Northwestern League of 1883 to 1884. Unlike the earlier minor associations, it was conceived as a permanent organization. It also, along with the NL and the American Association (AA), was a party to the National Agreement of 1883. Included in this was the agreement to respect the reserve lists of clubs in each league. Teams in the NL and the AA could only reserve players who had been paid at least $1,000. Northwestern League teams could reserve players paid $750, implicitly establishing the division into major and minor leagues. Over the next two decades, more minor leagues signed various versions of the National Agreement. Eventually, the minor leagues allied to negotiate jointly.\nIn the late 1890s, the Western League run by Ban Johnson decided to challenge the NL's position. In 1900, he changed the name of the league to the American League (AL) and vowed to make deals to sign contracts with players who were dissatisfied with the pay and terms of their deals with the NL. This led to a turf war that heated up in 1901 enough to concern Patrick T. Powers, president of the Eastern League, and many other minor league owners about the conflict potentially affecting their organizations. Representatives of the different minor leagues met at the Leland Hotel in Chicago on September 5, 1901. In response to the NL–AL battle, they agreed to form the \"National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues\" (NAPBL), sometimes shortened to National Association (NA), which would later adopt the trade name \"Minor League Baseball\". The purpose of the NAPBL at the time was to maintain the independence of the leagues involved. Several did not sign the agreement and continued to work independently. Powers was made the first president of the NAPBL, whose offices were established in Auburn, New York.\nIn 1903, the conflict between the AL and NL ended in the National Agreement of 1903, which created the National Baseball Commission to oversee the major and minor leagues. The NAPBL became involved in the later stages of the negotiations to develop rules for the acquisition of players from their leagues by the NL and the AL. The 1903 agreement ensured that teams would be compensated for the players that they had taken the time and effort to scout and develop, and no NA team was required to sell their players, although most did because the cash was an important source of revenue for most teams. The NA leagues were still fiercely independent, and the term \"minor\" was seldom used in reference to them, save by the major-market sportswriters. Sports news, like most news generally, often did not travel far in the days before radio and television, so, while the leagues often bristled at the major market writers' descriptions, they viewed themselves as independent sports businesses. Many baseball writers of that time regarded the greatest players of the minor leagues, such as Buzz Arlett, Jigger Statz, Ike Boone, Buddy Ryan, Earl Rapp, and Frank Shellenback, as comparable to major league players. Leagues in the NA would not be truly called minor until Branch Rickey developed the first modern farm system in the 1930s. The Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis fought Rickey's scheme, but, ultimately, the Great Depression drove teams to establish systems like Rickey's to ensure a steady supply of players, as many NA and independent teams could not afford to keep their doors open without the patronage of Major League Baseball. The leagues of the NA became subordinate to the major leagues, creating the first minor leagues in the current sense of the term. Other than the Pacific Coast League (PCL), which under its president Pants Rowland tried to become a third major league in the Western states, the other leagues maintained autonomy in name only, being totally economically dependent upon the AL and NL.\nIn 1922, the United States Supreme Court decision \"Federal Baseball Club v. National League\" (259 U.S. 200), which grants baseball a special immunity from antitrust laws, had a major effect on the minor leagues. The special immunity meant that the AL and NL could dictate terms under which every independent league did business. By 1925, major league baseball established a flat-fee purchase amount of $5,000 for the contract of any player from an NA member league team. This measure was leveled primarily at the Baltimore Orioles, then a Triple-A team that had dominated the minors by keeping players longer than many competitors, allowing the players to more fully develop, driving up their sale value to major-league teams and giving Baltimore a talent advantage. Deprived of this option by the flat-fee policy, minor league teams had little choice but to sell players as soon as they drew major-league interest.\nClassification history.\n19th century.\nThe earliest classifications used in the minor leagues began circa 1890, for teams that were party to the National Agreement of 1883. The different levels represented different levels of protection for player contracts and reserve clauses:\n20th century.\nAfter the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues was founded in 1901, classifications were redefined:\n Draft fee set an amount for a team in a higher class to select a player; n/a for Class A as it would be up to each team to negotiate with an interested major league club.&lt;br&gt;\n Protection fee reserved a player to a team, even after a contract expired, preventing the player for seeking employment with any other team.\nAll minor leagues were classified, and had the following assignments entering the 1902 season:\nAdditional classifications added prior to World War II included:\nPostwar changes.\nIn 1946, with the minor leagues poised for unprecedented growth, the higher-level classifications were changed. Class AAA (\"Triple-A\") was created and the three Double-A circuits (the Pacific Coast League, International League, and the American Association) were reclassified into Triple-A. Class A1 (comprising the Texas League, which had last operated in 1942, and the Southern Association) became Class AA. Class A remained the third-highest classification, with lower levels still ranked Class B through Class D in descending order, with Class D being the equivalent of later Rookie leagues. The impact of the Korean War in 1950 caused a player shortage in many cities below Class B.\nIn 1952, the \"Open\" classification was created. The Pacific Coast League (PCL), which had been rated Triple-A since 1946, was the only minor league to obtain this classification, which it held through 1957. At this time, the major leagues only extended as far west as St. Louis, Missouri, and as far south as Washington, D.C. This classification severely restricted the rights of the major leagues to draft players out of the PCL, and at the time it seemed like the PCL would eventually become a third major league. The PCL would revert to Triple-A in 1958, due to increasing television coverage of major league games and in light of the Dodgers and Giants moving to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively.\nReorganization of 1963.\nA significant reorganization of the minor leagues took place in 1963, caused by the contraction of clubs and leagues during the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1949, the peak of the postwar minor league baseball boom, 448 teams in 59 leagues were members of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, with the number of teams falling to 324 in 1952, and 243 in 1955. By the end of 1963, only 15 leagues above Rookie-level survived in the United States and Canada.\nAfter the 1962 season, the Triple-A American Association—which had lost key markets such as Milwaukee, Kansas City, Minneapolis–Saint Paul and Houston to the Major Leagues since 1953—disbanded. The surviving International and Pacific Coast leagues absorbed the four remaining American Association franchises. Meanwhile, at the Double-A level and below there were even more significant changes:\nDesignations below Class A disappeared because the lower levels could not sustain operation during a large downturn in the financial fortunes of minor league baseball, due to factors including the rise of television broadcasts of major league sports across broad regions of the country. As part of the 1963 reorganization, Major League clubs increased their commitments to affiliate with minor league teams through Player Development Contracts, outright ownerships, or shared affiliations and co-op arrangements.\nFurther changes after 1963.\nThe minor league system that evolved following the 1963 reorganization remained in place through 2020, categorizing leagues into one of six classes: Triple-A (AAA), Double-A (AA), Class A-Advanced (High A or A+), Class A (Low A), Class A Short Season, and Rookie. Furthermore, Rookie was further informally subdivided into Rookie Advanced, complex-based Rookie, and international summer baseball.\nThere have also been some failed start-up leagues. During the 1970s, three official minor leagues (members of NAPBL) attempted unsuccessfully to revive unaffiliated baseball (teams not associated with specific MLB franchises) within the organized baseball structure. These were the Class A Gulf States League (1976) and Lone Star League (1977), and the Triple-A Inter–American League (1979). None lasted more than a full season.\nReorganization of 2021.\nIn October 2019, \"Baseball America\" reported that Major League Baseball had proposed dramatic changes to MiLB that would take effect after expiration of the Professional Baseball Agreement, which governed the MLB–MiLB relationship, at the end of the 2020 season. This included the elimination of many minor league teams.\nIn mid-November 2019, more than 100 members of the United States Congress signed a letter sent to Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred opposing the proposal, noting that it \"is not in the best interest of the overall game of baseball\" and that it would \"devastate our communities, their bond purchasers and other stakeholders affected by the potential loss of these clubs.\" A response from MLB highlighted that the proposal aims to improve player travel and working conditions.\nOn November 21, 2019, Minor League Baseball released a statement, asserting that it is \"unnecessary and unacceptable to wipe out one-quarter of minor league teams\" and characterized the proposal as a way \"to improve the profitability of MLB\". Manfred rebuked Minor League Baseball for releasing the negotiations to the public and threatened to cut ties with MiLB altogether.\nThe following changes, which represent the first significant overhaul of minor league classifications since 1963, have since been implemented:\nAffiliate invites for 2021.\nWhen MLB teams announced their affiliates for the 2021 season on December 9, 2020, each of the 30 MLB teams had one affiliate at four levels—Triple-A, Double-A, High-A, and Low-A—for a total of 120 affiliated teams. Approximately 40 teams lost their MLB affiliations; the Fresno Grizzlies were demoted from Triple-A to Low-A; and the majority of surviving clubs at High-A and Low-A swapped levels, with the former Florida State League and California League dropped down nearly as intact units and the Northwest League and Midwest League promoted with 75% of their teams. The Carolina League dropped to Low-A with seven of its ten teams and added five from the old South Atlantic League in trade; the SAL in turn moved to High-A with half of its previous 12-team roster, filling it out with two Carolina League High-A holdovers, one Midwest League returnee, and three formerly short-season New York-Penn League promotees.\nLeague realignment.\nOn February 12, 2021, Major League Baseball announced new league alignments for all 120 affiliated Minor League Baseball clubs effective as of the 2021 season. Contrary to previously published reports indicating that realignment would retain the names of the existing minor leagues, Major League Baseball elected to abandon the names of existing minor leagues in favor of a new, class- and region-based naming system.\nTriple-A was divided into two leagues:\nDouble-A was divided into three leagues:\nHigh-A (formerly Class A-Advanced) was divided into three leagues:\nLow-A (formerly Class A) was divided into three leagues:\nThe US-based Rookie-level leagues were renamed prior to starting play in late June; the former Gulf Coast League was renamed as the Florida Complex League and the former Arizona League was renamed as the Arizona Complex League.\nOn March 16, 2022, Minor League Baseball announced that the historic league names were acquired by MLB. The region-based names were scrapped and the previous league names given to the new leagues that most closely resembled the old leagues.\nThe Low-A classification was also renamed Single-A. Additionally, the International League was reorganized from three divisions to two: East and West.\nClassification hierarchy.\nThe following classifications, listed from highest to lowest, have existed since the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (the formal name of Minor League Baseball) was established prior to the 1902 season. Only seasons where a change was made to the hierarchy are listed; class introductions after 1902 appear in bold font, while class eliminations appear in italics. Not all defined classifications were used each season.\nNotes:\nPlayers.\nMajor league clubs may only use players who are on the team's major league active roster in games; players on the active roster are selected from a 40-man major league reserve list (often called the 40-man roster). Effective with the 2020 Major League Baseball season, the active roster size for each team is 26 players for regular games and 27 players for scheduled doubleheaders, with the roster size expanding to 28 players from September 1 through the end of the regular season. Prior to the 2020 season, the active roster size from the start of the regular season until September 1 was 25 players, with a 26th player allowed for a scheduled doubleheader. From September 1 to the end of the regular season, teams were allowed to expand their active rosters up to 40 players, the size of the major league reserve list.\nPlayers on the 40-man reserve list who are not on the team's active roster are generally either on the injured list or playing at some level of the minor leagues (usually at the Triple-A or Double-A level). Players on the 40-man reserve list are eligible for membership in the Major League Baseball Players Association. These minor league players work at the lower end of major league pay scales and are covered by all rules and player agreements of the players association. Minor league players not on the 40-man reserve list are under contract to their respective parent Major League Baseball clubs. Until September 2022, they did not have union representation, but they joined the MLBPA following a majority of minor leaguer players expressing support. They generally work for far less pay as they develop their skills and work their way up the ladder toward the major leagues. Many players have signing bonuses and other additional compensation that can run into the millions of dollars, although that is generally reserved for early-round draft picks.\nA major league team's director of player development determines where a given player will be placed in the farm system, in coordination with the coaches and managers who evaluate their talent. At the end of spring training, players both from the spring major camp and minor league winter camp are placed by the major league club on the roster of a minor league team. The director of player development and the general manager usually determine the initial assignments for new draftees, who typically begin playing professionally in June after they have been signed to contracts. The farm system is ever-changing, and the evaluation of players is a constantly ongoing process. The director of player development and his managers meet or teleconference regularly to discuss how players are performing at each level. Personal development, injuries, and high levels of achievement by players in the classes below all steer a player's movement up and down in the class system.\nPlayers will play for the team to which they are assigned for the duration of that season unless they are \"called up\" (promoted to a higher level), \"sent down\" (demoted to a lower-class team in the major league club's farm system), or released from the farm system entirely. A release from minor-league level used to spell the end of a minor league player's career. In more modern times, released players often sign with independent baseball clubs, which are scouted heavily by major league organizations. Many players get a second or third look from the major league scouts if they improve in the independent leagues.\nMinor league salaries vary based on class level and length of season; however, the majority of players make less than $10,000 per season. Although not playing at the major league level, minor league players are professional athletes. Minor league players often colloquially refer to the major leagues as \"The Show\".\nRehabilitation assignments.\nRehabilitating with Minor League teams is a standard way for injured Major League players to get back into playing shape.\nPlayers on the injured list (IL) can be sent to the minor leagues to aid in rehabilitation following an injury, typically for one or two weeks. Players are often sent to minor league clubs based on geography and facilities, not necessarily by class for these reassignments.\nRehabbing major leaguers continue to receive Major League pay and generally enjoy better amenities than their minor league teammates.\nFormer Minnesota Twins star Joe Mauer, who missed most of the first two months of the 2011 season due to a difficult recovery from arthroscopic knee surgery after the 2010 season, reported to Minnesota's Class A-Advanced Florida State League team, the Fort Myers Miracle, which is based in their spring training facility in Fort Myers. The Miracle manager at the time was Mauer's older brother Jake.\nMike Trout's first rehab assignment of his career, in July 2017, was with the Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino, California, the Class A-Advanced affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels. This allowed Trout to stay closer to the Angels compared to the team's Triple-A affiliate, the Salt Lake Bees.\nUmpires.\nUmpires at the minor league level are overseen by Minor League Baseball Umpire Development (MiLBUD), which is responsible for the training, evaluation, and recommendation for promotion and retention or release of the umpires.\nThe umpires are evaluated eight times a season by the staff of MiLBUD and receive a ranking at mid-season and the end of each year. Based on performance during the year, an umpire may advance in classification when a position opens in-season or during the off-season. MiLBUD holds an annual Rookie Evaluation Course every year in March to evaluate rookie umpires. Participants are normally the best students from the two professional umpire schools (one owned and operated by the same entity). The top students who pass the evaluation course are recommended for the first openings in lower-level leagues.\nAny student who wants to work as an umpire must attend a professional umpire training school. Minor League Baseball recognizes two schools for training prospective professional umpires, the Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School and Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy, both located in Florida. The Umpire Training Academy is owned and operated by MiLBUD, while the Wendelstedt Umpire School is independently owned by MLB umpire Hunter Wendelstedt. The classes for each school are held for five weeks in January and February. The instructors at these schools are former or present major or minor league umpires. Simply attending one of these schools, however, does not guarantee that the candidate will be recommended to the evaluation course or for openings in lower-level leagues. Generally, less than 20% of students move on to the Rookie Evaluation Course.\nBefore a development program was created, minor league presidents would recruit directly from umpire schools. Umpires were then \"sold\" from league to league by word of mouth through the various league presidents. The umpire development program first started in 1964, when it was decided that a method of recruitment, training, and development for umpires of both major and minor leagues was needed. The program was founded at baseball's 1964 Winter Meetings in Houston, and it began operating the next year. The program aimed to recruit more athletic, energetic, and dedicated individuals who would also have high morals and integrity standards. In 1968, it was decided that the program needed its own umpire training course, which would be held annually. The first \"Umpire Specialization Course\" was held in St. Petersburg, Florida, the following year.\nMinor league umpires have been unionized since 1999, when they formed the Association of Minor League Umpires (AMLU), which has been a guild within the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) since 2010. A strike action occurred at the start of the 2006 season, spurred by a disagreement over salaries and resulting in the use of replacement umpires until an agreement was reached after two months.\nPresently, the candidates for a job in professional umpiring must meet several requirements in order to be considered. An applicant must have a high school diploma or a G.E.D., must be athletic, and also must have 20/20 vision, although they are permitted to wear glasses or contact lenses. They must also have good communication skills, good reflexes and coordination, and must have trained at one of the two professional umpire schools.\nOwnership.\nTeams in the affiliated minor leagues are generally independently owned and operated, and are directly affiliated with one major league team. Affiliations are governed by standardized agreements; historically known as a Player Development Contract (PDC), as of 2021 the term Player Development License Agreement (PDL) is used. Some minor league teams are directly owned by their major league parent club, such as the Springfield Cardinals, owned by the St. Louis Cardinals, and all of the New York Mets' affiliates except the Binghamton Rumble Ponies.\nWith the reorganization of 2021, the standard length of an affiliation agreement is 10 years. Previously, affiliations were for only two or four years, with affiliation changes being fairly frequent, though many relationships have been renewed and endure for extended time periods. For example, the Omaha Storm Chasers (formerly the Omaha Royals and Omaha Golden Spikes) have been the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals since the Royals joined the American League in 1969, but the Columbus Clippers, having been affiliated with the New York Yankees since 1979, changed affiliations to the Washington Nationals in 2007, and again changed to the Cleveland Indians two years later in 2009.\nGenerally, the parent major league club pays the salaries and benefits of uniformed personnel (players and coaches) and provides bats and balls, while the minor league club pays for in-season travel and other operational expenses.\nThe longest continuous affiliations are between the Philadelphia Phillies and their Double-A affiliate, the Reading Fightin Phils and between the Detroit Tigers and their Low-A affiliate, the Lakeland Flying Tigers, both of which date to 1965. Both Reading and Lakeland are now owned outright by their parent major league clubs.\nPresidents.\nMinor League Baseball was governed through a centralized office until the restructuring of the minor leagues in 2021, with Major League Baseball itself now handling \"all issues related to governance, scheduling, umpiring, license compliance, and other league administration functions.\" Minor league headquarters were located in St. Petersburg, Florida, from 1973 onward. As of 2009, Minor League Baseball had 27 employees in St. Petersburg. Before coming under the direct control of MLB, 11 people served as president of Minor League Baseball:\nIndependent baseball.\nIndependent leagues are those professional leagues in the United States and Canada not under the purview of organized Minor League Baseball and the Commissioner of Baseball. Independent baseball existed in the early 20th century and has become prominent again since 1993.\nLeagues operated mostly autonomously before 1902, when the majority joined the NAPBL. From then until 1915, a total of eight new and existing leagues remained independent. Most joined the National Association after one season of independence. Notable exceptions were the California League, which was independent in 1902 and from 1907 to 1909; the United States Baseball League, which folded during its independent 1912 season; and the Colonial League, a National Association Member that went independent in 1915 and then folded. Another independent league, the Federal League, played at a level considered major league from 1914 to 1915.\nFew independent leagues existed between 1915 and 1993. Major exceptions included the Carolina League and the Quebec-based Provincial League. The Carolina League, based in the North Carolina Piedmont region, gained a reputation as a notorious \"outlaw league\" during its existence from 1936 to 1938. The Provincial League fielded six teams across Quebec and was independent from 1948 to 1949. Similarly to early 20th-century independent leagues, it joined the National Association in 1950, playing for six more years.\nIndependent leagues saw new growth after 1992, after the new Professional Baseball Agreement in organized baseball instituted more stringent revenue and stadium requirements on members. Over the next eight years, at least 16 independent leagues formed, of which six existed in 2002. As of the 2024 season, there are seven active leagues, with four of them acting as MLB Partner Leagues.\nAwards.\nMiLBY Awards.\nThe MiLBY Awards (formerly \"This Year in Minor League Baseball Awards\") are given in nine categories. In five categories (Best Starter, Best Hitter, Best Reliever, Best Game, and Best Team), winners are selected at each level of Minor League Baseball above Rookie league. In three categories (Play of the Year, Moment of the Year, and Homer of the Year), one overall winner is chosen for all of Minor League Baseball. In the remaining category (Promo of the Year), there are overall winners in each of five subcategories: Best Promotion (of all types), Best Theme Night, Best Giveaway, Best Celebrity Appearance, and Best Miscellaneous Promotion.\nTop 100 teams.\nDuring its centennial celebration in 2001, Minor League Baseball compiled a list of the 100 best minor-league baseball teams of the century.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nNearly every minor-league team has its own local radio contract, though unlike their major-league counterparts, these generally consist of only one or two individual stations.\nAlso see: (MiLB is a sub-template).\nTelevision.\nNationally, Minor League Baseball games air on Stadium and MLB Network.\nMany individual teams have contracts with local television channels. For example, the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians have a contract with WISH-TV to air 35 home games during the 2021 season.\nStreaming media.\nMiLB.TV is the minor leagues' online video streaming service, in the vein of Major League Baseball's MLB.tv. Entering the 2021 season, the subscription service offers games for all Triple-A and Double-A teams, and select games from other classifications.\nTuneIn has provided free audio streams to minor league games, accessible through the MiLB.TV website."

The defending team was Norway.\nThe winning team was Norway.\nCompetition format.\nThe relay teams consist of four biathletes. Legs 1 and 2 are skied by the women, and legs 3 and 4 by the men. The women's legs are and men's legs are . Every athlete's leg is skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds: one prone and one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually from the spare round holders or from bullets deposited by the athlete into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still standing targets, one penalty loop must be taken for each remaining target. The first-leg participants all start at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five).\nThe single mixed relay involves one male and one female biathlete each completing two legs consisting of one prone and one standing shoot. The female biathletes all start the race at the same time and complete one leg before exchanging with their male counterparts who complete one leg before exchanging again with the female skier who after completing another leg switches again with the male biathlete who completes the race. The rules regarding shooting are the same as in the regular mixed relay."

        "text": "The Queensland Under-16 rugby league team, also known as Queensland Under-16s or Queensland U16, represents Queensland in the sport of rugby league at an under-16 age level. Since 2008, the team has played an annual fixture against the New South Wales Under-16s team as a curtain raiser to a State of Origin game. The team features players selected from Queensland's premier under-16 rugby league competition, the Cyril Connell Cup. They are administered by the Queensland Rugby League.\nHistory.\nPrior to 2008, junior interstate matches were contested at under-17 and under-19 levels. In 2008, with the advent of the National Youth Competition, the age levels switched to an under-16 and under-18 format to keep in line with the NSWRL's existing SG Ball Cup and Harold Matthews Cup competitions and the QRL's Mal Meninga Cup and Cyril Connell Cup competitions, which would begin in 2009.\nQueensland suffered defeat in the first under-16 Origin fixture in 2008, with a side that featured future NRL players Kyle Feldt, Ben Hampton, Lachlan Maranta and Korbin Sims. They recorded their first win a year later, defeating New South Wales 30–10 in 2009. That team featured future New Zealand international Jason Taumalolo. From 2010 to 2013, Queensland suffered four straight defeats before winning both fixtures against New South Wales in 2014 and 2015.\nPlayers.\nPlayers selected for the Queensland under-16 team are usually contracted with a National Rugby League (NRL) side and, until 2017, played in the Cyril Connell Cup. Occasionally players who are contracted to Sydney-based NRL sides, who play in the Harold Matthews Cup, are selected. In 2008, before the Cyril Connell Cup began, players were selected from the under-16 representative carnival in Proserpine. Each pre-season the Queensland Rugby League will select an under-16 squad featuring players in contention for the mid-season fixture. The squad participates in a weekend camp at the Queensland Academy of Sport.\nIn 2017, the QRL ended the Cyril Connell Cup, replacing it with a three-day statewide carnival in which the Queensland under-16 side would be selected from.\nIn 2019, no under-16 State of Origin was held, with both states instead holding a City vs Country fixture. On 29 September 2019, Queensland Country under-16 defeated City 44–4, and a Queensland under-16 merit side was named after the game."

An All-American varsity tennis player at Samford University, Bailey began competing internationally in the late 1970s. \nHe won a Grand Prix doubles title in Lagos, Nigeria with Bruce Kleege in 1979. \nIn singles, he had his first big match win at Sarasota in 1980 when he saved triple match points to upset Steve Krulevitz, from a set and 2–5 down. He had only entered the tournament as a wild card, which was awarded as he was the son of Mack Bailey, who owned the company that sponsored the tournament. At the Tulsa that year he made the quarter-finals, his best performance in a Grand Prix tournament. He competed in the main draw of the 1981 Wimbledon Championships and had a two set lead over Kevin Curren in their first round encounter, but lost in five.\nFrom the 1980s he lived in Japan and appeared in many tournaments in that country, as well as earning a living teaching tennis.

        "text": "The men's eight competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics took place at Grünau Regatta Course in Berlin, Germany. The event was held from 12 to 14 August, and was won by a United States crew from the University of Washington. There were 14 boats (126 competitors) from 14 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The victory was the fifth consecutive gold medal in the event for the United States and seventh overall; the Americans had won every time they competed (missing 1908 and 1912). Italy repeated as silver medalists. Germany earned its first medal in the men's eight since 1912 with its bronze. Canada's three-Games podium streak ended.\nRowing events were dominated by the hosts, Germany, who medaled in every event and took five of the seven gold medals. The final race, men's eights, was won by a working-class United States team from the University of Washington who, in what had become their trademark, started slow and outsprinted the competition to an exceedingly close finish, with only one second separating the top three finishers at the end of a six-and-a-half minute race. This event is chronicled in \"The Boys in the Boat\" written by Daniel James Brown, which later became a film of the same name.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThe United States was the dominant nation in the event, with the nation winning the previous four Olympic men's eight competitions (as well as the other two competitions which the United States had entered). The American crew this year came from the University of Washington, which had won the 1936 Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta. Switzerland had won the 1936 Grand Challenge Cup. Hungary had won the 1933, 1934, and 1935 European championships. The Australian crew was all police crew from the New South Wales Policeman's Rowing Club in Sydney who had dominated at state titles for the previous two years. They were selected in toto with their attendance funded by the NSW Police Federation.\nYugoslavia made its debut in the event. Canada, Great Britain, and the United States each made their seventh appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nThe 1936 competition had a six-boat final for the first time. The competition continued to use the three-round format used in 1932, with two main rounds (semifinals and a final) and a repechage.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\n12 August. The first boat in each heat advanced directly to final. The other boats competed again in the repechage for remaining spots in the final.\nRepechage.\n13 August. The winner of each race advanced to the final; the other boats were eliminated.\nRepechage heat 3.\n14 August. "

The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) agreed in principle for one of the Test matches to be played as a day/night match.\nOriginally, the schedule was going to be two Tests, five ODIs and two T20Is. In May 2016, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) began looking at the possibility for the series to be held in Sri Lanka. However, the idea was dismissed as it would be monsoon season in Sri Lanka. The fixtures, including the day/night Test at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, Dubai, were confirmed by the PCB in August 2016.\nThe first Test in Dubai was Pakistan's 400th Test match and the second day/night Test. Prior to the start of the day/night Test, both captains voiced their support for the format. Pakistan's captain Misbah-ul-Haq said \"At the moment, it looks like (the future) keeping in mind the interest of the audience, who want to watch Test cricket\". The West Indies captain Jason Holder said that he liked the concept and that \"we have to give a chance to something new\". However, at the start of the first day of the Test, only 68 fans were inside the stadium, with the figure growing to approximately 600 by close of play. Pakistan's coach Mickey Arthur said after the conclusion of the day/night Test that \"there's some work to do with the pink ball. I don't think it's up to the standard required yet and I think that's the only thing holding day/night cricket back\".\nPakistan won both the ODI and T20I series 3–0. The Test series was also won by Pakistan, by the margin of 2–1. The West Indies won the final Test match of the series, which was their first Test win with Jason Holder as captain. After the victory, Holder said \"we showed character and fight. Credit must go to Kraigg Brathwaite. He played an outstanding innings in the first innings and took responsibility of the chase in the second innings\".\nSquads.\nAndre Russell was ruled out of the West Indies T20I squad after withdrawing due to a personal matter. He was replaced by Kesrick Williams. Younis Khan was added to Pakistan's Test squad for the 2nd Test after missing the 1st Test due to dengue fever."

South Africa won the series 2–1, with victories in Perth and Hobart.\nIn April 2016, Cricket Australia (CA) suggested that the third Test at the Adelaide Oval could be played as a day/night match, but there was some reluctance from the South African cricketers. In June, CA confirmed that the Adelaide Test would be played as a day/night game. Prior to the series, both teams played practice day/night matches.\nSouth Africa played 2 two-day day/night warm-up fixtures at the Adelaide Oval and the Melbourne Cricket Ground in preparation for the day-night Test match.\nFollowing the conclusion of the second Test, footage emerged of South Africa's captain Faf du Plessis apparently shining the ball using a sweet in his mouth. He was charged by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for ball tampering and pled not-guilty. Hashim Amla said that the situation was \"ridiculous\" and \"a joke\". It was suggested that a hearing would take place after the conclusion of the third Test, as Cricket South Africa (CSA) had engaged legal representation for du Plessis. However, on 22 November, du Plessis was found guilty of ball tampering, fined his match fee from the Hobart Test, but was allowed to play in the Adelaide Test. After du Plessis was found guilty he said he disagreed with the verdict stating \"I felt like I have done nothing wrong\". Du Plessis appealed the charge, but that was rejected on 21 December 2016. The initial penalties of losing his match fee and getting three demerit points stood, but he was not punished with a one-match ban.\nSquads.\nDale Steyn suffered a shoulder injury during the first Test and was ruled out of the rest of the series. Dwaine Pretorius was added to South Africa's squad to replace Steyn. Joe Burns and Callum Ferguson were added to Australia's squad for the second Test, while Shaun Marsh was ruled out with a broken finger. Peter Siddle was ruled out due to a back injury and Jackson Bird was added to Australia's team as cover for him.\nFor the third Test of the tour, Australia added Matt Renshaw, Peter Handscomb, Nic Maddinson, Chadd Sayers and Matthew Wade to their squad. Joe Burns, Callum Ferguson, Peter Nevill and Joe Mennie were all dropped, while Adam Voges was ruled out with concussion."

Ahead of the fourth Test, Shreyas Iyer was added to India's squad as cover for Virat Kohli, who was suffering with a shoulder injury.\nDecision referral.\nThe second Test witnessed a controversy when the Australian team was accused of having taken help from the dressing room in using the Decision Review System (DRS). Australia's captain Steve Smith admitted to having looked in the direction of the dressing room for assistance when he was given out leg before wicket (lbw) off Umesh Yadav when he was on 28 by the on-field umpire Nigel Llong, who, immediately intervened to send him back and denying a referral. India's captain Virat Kohli, in his post-match interview, accused the team of having done that on at least three occasions; once as Smith was declared lbw, and twice as he batted, which he stated to having pointed out to the umpires. As the controversy broke out, Australia's Peter Handscomb tweeted admitting to have \"referred\" Smith to \"look at the box\". Picking on Smith having played down the incident terming it a \"brain fade\", Kohli said, \"Honestly, if someone makes a mistake while batting, for me, personally, that's a brain fade. ... But if something is going on for three days, then that's not a brain fade, as simple as that.\"\nAustralia's coach Darren Lehmann dismissed Kohli's allegations and responded that his team \"[n]ever, ever, ever\" sought the dressing room's assistance. The CEO of Cricket Australia (CA), James Sutherland called the criticism \"outrageous\" and said, \"We reject any commentary that suggests our integrity was brought into disrepute or that systemic unfair tactics are used, and stand by Steve and the Australian cricketers who are proudly representing our country.\" The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) responded with a statement: \"BCCI has requested the ICC (International Cricket Council) to take cognisance of the fact that Smith admitted to a 'brain fade' at that moment. BCCI sincerely hopes that the rest of the matches are played in the true spirit of cricket.\" The ICC said it would not \"press charges\" against either teams or captains and added that ahead of the third Test, the match referee would \"bring both captains together to remind them of their responsibilities to the game\". However, the BCCI filed an official complaint against Steve Smith and Peter Handscomb with the ICC."

Johnson (September 26, 1921 – January 12, 1988) was an American baseball executive, whose most significant role was as president of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues from 1979 through 1988. He was born in Staten Island, New York.\nJohnson was credited with helping the then struggling organization stabilize and grow. During his ten-year tenure, he was in charge of 17 minor league circuits and 176 teams throughout the United States. One of his most important achievements was an extensive overhaul of the master player development contract, which governs the relations between Major League Baseball organizations and their mostly independently owned Minor League affiliates.\nEarly life.\nJohnson, whose strength was as an administrator, joined the New York Yankees organization in 1947, working for them for 24 years. He served initially as secretary to general manager George Weiss. Johnson was later promoted as general manager of the Double-A Binghamton Triplets farm club, traveling secretary for the Yankees, and finally as vice president for minor league operations.\nWhen Bowie Kuhn was elected baseball commissioner in 1969, Johnson joined his office staff for the next eight years. Following his stint as administrator for Kuhn, Johnson was unanimously elected as president of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues at the Winter Meetings held in 1978, succeeding Bobby Bragan. Johnson received a five-year contract extension in 1981 and was re-elected to a three-year term in 1986. With Johnson at the helm, the NAPBL attendance soared to more than 20 million fans in 1987, a figure not matched since the 1953 season.\nJohnson was diagnosed with chest cancer in September 1987. He was a long-time resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, where he died in January 1988 at the age of 66.\nThe John H. Johnson President's Award, is considered the most prestigious recognition given by Minor League Baseball and is awarded annually to honor the complete minor league franchise, based on franchise stability, contributions to league stability, contributions to baseball in the community, and promotion of the baseball industry. Originally known only as the President's Award when it was created in 1974, it was renamed in Johnson's honor starting with the 1988 season."

He took nine wickets in the match, including a five-wicket haul in the second innings. India won the match and his performance earned him the man of the match honour. His career-best figures of seven wickets for 59 runs came against New Zealand in October 2016; in the process he also became the fifth bowler to take six five-wicket hauls against them. He has picked up ten or more wickets in a match on seven occasions. Ashwin made his ODI and T20I debuts in June 2010 against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, respectively, and is yet to take a five-wicket haul in both formats. His four wickets for 25 runs against the United Arab Emirates in the 2015 World Cup remain his best in ODIs, while his figures of four wickets for 8 runs against Sri Lanka are the fourth-best by an Indian in T20Is."

In the seasons during the Second World War the final was played over two legs, with the aggregate score being used. The final was played at many neutral venues up to and including 1928 after which it was mostly played at Wembley Stadium until 1939 just prior to the Second World War apart from 1932 when it was switched to Central Park, Wigan. In the war years, apart from 1940, it was played at various venues between 1941–45 after which it returned to Wembley in 1946 when the final permanently became a Wembley final.\nIn 1909–10 Leeds and Hull F.C. drew 7–7 for the first time in a final at Huddersfield and a replay resulted in a Leeds win.

        "title": "1985 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game",
        "text": "The 1985 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the final of the 1985 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and determined the national champion in the 1984–85 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The game was held on April 1, 1985 at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky. The Georgetown Hoyas, the defending national champions and the tournament's number one seed from the East region, faced the Villanova Wildcats, the eighth seed from the Southeast region. The teams came from the same conference, the Big East, and the championship game was the third meeting between them in 1984–85, after two regular season contests. Villanova won the title game by a score of 66–64, in what is considered by analysts to be one of the biggest upsets in an NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament game. The Wildcats had the highest field goal percentage in Final Four history, winning their first national championship in men's basketball. The game is referred to as \"The Perfect Game\", as the Wildcats shot 78.6 percent as a team for the game (22 for 28, including 9 for 10 in the second half).\nBackground.\nGeorgetown Hoyas.\nThe Hoyas entered the 1984–85 season as the defending national champion, having won the title in 1984. Coached by John Thompson, the Hoyas featured center Patrick Ewing, who was named to the 1985 All-American team. The Hoyas held the number one ranking in the Associated Press Poll at the start of the season, and won their first 14 games against Division I clubs. The team alternated the position with fellow Big East team St. John's. Georgetown lost only two games in the regular season, consecutive matchups with St. John's and Syracuse, before an 11-game winning streak prior to the NCAA Tournament that included a Big East Tournament championship. After losing their number one ranking after their pair of losses, Georgetown regained the position in the March 5 rankings and held it at the end of the regular season. The team was thought of at the time as one of the best college clubs in years. Their wins included a pair over Villanova in conference play. In the first game, held at the Spectrum in Philadelphia, Villanova's home arena, the teams battled into overtime before the Hoyas claimed a two-point victory. The repeat contest, in Washington, D.C., was also closely contested, but Georgetown again prevailed, 57–50.\nGeorgetown received the top seed in the East regional bracket of the 1985 NCAA Tournament, the first with 64 teams in the field, and faced Lehigh in the first round. A 68–43 victory set up a second-round matchup with eighth-seeded Temple, which the Hoyas won 63–46 to advance to the regional semifinals. There, Georgetown was matched with number four seed Loyola University Chicago; the Hoyas prevailed by 12 points and moved on to the East region's final. Against Georgia Tech, the Hoyas played in their closest game of the tournament to that point, winning 60–54 to advance to the Final Four. In an all-Big East game, Georgetown defeated St. John's 77–59, behind 20 points by Reggie Williams and 16 by Ewing, to clinch a spot in the national championship game.\nVillanova Wildcats.\nCoached by Rollie Massimino, the Wildcats were coming off of a season in which they had lost to Illinois in the second round of the 1984 NCAA Tournament. The team's regular starting lineup included seniors Ed Pinckney, Dwayne McClain, and Gary McLain, along with juniors Harold Pressley and Dwight Wilbur. Villanova began the season 13–3, before a January 1985 loss at Maryland. The defeat started a slump that lasted throughout the rest of the regular season; the Wildcats had a 5–5 record in their final 10 regular season games, capped by a 23-point loss at Pittsburgh. After peaking at number 14 in the January 22 rankings, the team fell out of the Associated Press Poll by mid-February. With an 18–9 record overall entering the 1985 Big East men's basketball tournament, Villanova was not assured of receiving an invitation to the NCAA Tournament. In a rematch against Pittsburgh, the team won by eight points to effectively secure their tournament berth. In the semifinals of the Big East Tournament, the Wildcats suffered a 15-point loss to St. John's, leaving their record at 19–10 going into the NCAA Tournament.\nThe Wildcats received the Southeast regional bracket's eighth seed and were matched in the first round against ninth-seeded Dayton, with the game held in Dayton's home arena. Despite the disadvantage of playing in what amounted to a road game, Villanova advanced after a closely contested contest; a go-ahead layup by Pressley gave the Wildcats a late lead that they held until the end. The Wildcats then won their second-round game, 59–55, over the region's top seed, Michigan, before a 46–43 victory in a rematch against Maryland (the fifth seed) that sent them to the regional final. North Carolina, their opponent, held a five-point lead at halftime before a strong performance in the second half led to a 12-point Villanova win and a spot in the Final Four. In their game against Memphis State, the Wildcats won by a 52–45 final score to gain their title game berth.\nGame summary.\nThe game was played at Rupp Arena, in front of a crowd of 23,124 spectators. Georgetown was listed as a nine-point favorite entering the contest. The Wildcats opened the scoring early in the first half. After Villanova narrowly avoided a turnover twice, Ed Pinckney passed the ball to Harold Pressley; under pressure from Ewing on defense, Pressley scored on a reverse layup to give the Wildcats a 2–0 lead. The Hoyas' David Wingate evened the score with a successful jump shot. The teams then traded baskets; a slam dunk by McClain was followed by another jump shot by Wingate. Villanova made their first four field goal attempts, but fell behind 10–8 as they committed four turnovers during the period. Georgetown played a 1–3–1 defense focused on trapping and pressuring the Wildcats' players, while Villanova used a match-up zone defense. With about 16 minutes elapsed in the first half, the Hoyas held a one-point advantage. Ewing responded by scoring on dunks on each of Georgetown's following three possessions. The Hoyas were unable to extend their lead, however, because Villanova found success on long field goal attempts. Three Wildcats players scored on long-range jumpers, including a shot by Pressley that fell after hitting the rim multiple times. The Wildcats employed a \"patient\" offensive strategy during the game, which was in evidence during the last two minutes of the first half as Pinckney, with two personal fouls, was not on the floor. The team employed what author Frank Fitzpatrick called \"the last successful stall in college basketball history.\"\nAfter obtaining ball possession with 1:58 left, the Wildcats went into a four corners offense and held the ball until the closing seconds of the half, a tactic that was legal because a shot clock was not instituted in college basketball until the 1985–86 season. Georgetown was playing a 1–3–1 zone defense, allowing the Wildcats to execute their strategy. In one of four times during the game that Villanova maintained possession for over 45 seconds, Pressley made a shot to put his team up 29–28. A long-distance shot by Wingate missed as time ran out in the first half, and the arm of Georgetown forward Williams made contact with the face and neck of Villanova reserve Chuck Everson; no foul was called, but Villanova assistant coach Marty Marback credited the encounter with giving his team energy going into the halftime break.\nAfter an opening period that announcer Brent Musburger called \"as good a half of college basketball as I've ever seen,\" the second half began with a successful jump shot by Ewing; Thompson had told the Hoyas to feature him in their offense. The Wildcats reclaimed the lead on a field goal by Harold Jensen, his third of the game, before Pinckney made a shot while being fouled by Ewing. His ensuing free throw attempt was good, and Villanova extended their lead to 34–30. The play began a stretch of about a minute in which Ewing committed three personal fouls and had to be removed from the Hoyas lineup; with Williams suffering from an ankle injury, Georgetown's two leading players on offense were out of the game. The Wildcats began taking more time on their possessions, and took a 38–32 advantage in the first four minutes of the half. Ewing re-entered the game, but Villanova maintained their lead; three points by McClain brought the score to 41–36. McLain was injured while running into Hoyas player Horace Broadnax and was temporarily forced to the bench. With 10 minutes left in regulation, the Wildcats held a one-point lead, even though they had attempted only five field goals so far in the second half. Over the next few minutes of play, Villanova went up 53–48; after a field goal by Pinckney, the Hoyas called a timeout. The closing six minutes started with a Georgetown scoring run; the Hoyas took a 54–53 lead and gained ball possession off of a turnover by Villanova with about four minutes left.\nAt this time, the Hoyas borrowed a page from Villanova's offensive strategy and started running the four corners offense, with the hopes of causing the Wildcats to abandon their regular defense and shift to man-to-man coverage. The team's plan was foiled when a pass by Bill Martin deflected out of bounds off the shin of Broadnax. Under 30 seconds had gone off the clock when the Wildcats regained the ball. Villanova resumed their ball-control offense, and took the lead with 2:37 remaining on a made shot by Jensen; the Wildcats had taken 62 seconds to run the play. Jensen's shot was the last attempted by Villanova in the game; all of the team's remaining points came on free throws. The Wildcats scored the next four points and were up 59–54 going into the final 84 seconds. Although the team was unsuccessful on multiple one-and-one free throw attempts, they added seven more points in the final portion of the game. The last made free throw, on the second of two attempts by Pressley, gave the Wildcats a 66–62 advantage with approximately 10 seconds on the clock. A shot by Michael Jackson brought the Hoyas to within two points in the closing seconds. Wingate stopped the clock from expiring by hitting the ball out of play with two seconds left. Jensen inbounded the ball to McClain, who had gone to the floor, and McClain kept possession until time expired and the Wildcats won the game and the Division I national championship, 66–64.\nStatistical summary.\nThe top scorer in the game was McClain, who had 17 points; just behind him on the Wildcats was Pinckney, who had a 16-point performance. Jensen had a perfect shooting night, going 5-for-5 and finishing with 14 points. The Hoyas' leading scorer was Wingate, who posted 17 points. Ewing had 14 points in the game, but was both out-scored and outrebounded by the Wildcats' Pinckney; he had five rebounds, one fewer than Pinckney. Martin had 10 points in the game and matched Ewing's total of five rebounds. The top assist provider for either team was Georgetown's Jackson, who had nine assists and added eight points.\nThe Wildcats were successful on 22 of 28 field goal attempts in the game, for a shooting percentage of 78.6 percent. The team made all but one of their 10 shot attempts in the second half. The Wildcats set NCAA Tournament championship game records for the highest shooting percentage and the fewest shot attempts; both figures are also records for any Final Four game as of 2019. Villanova made most of their free throw attempts, converting on 22 of 27 attempts. Georgetown made more than 50 percent of their shots as well, with 54 percent shooting (29 for 53). The Hoyas had 19 fewer free throw attempts than Villanova, although they were successful on six of their eight tries. The Wildcats committed 12 fouls in the game, and held Ewing without a free throw attempt. Georgetown had 11 turnovers in the contest, six fewer than the 17 by Villanova; that total included six by Jensen. Sportswriter Tim Layden commented on the Wildcats' statistics, \"Part of what is so fascinating about the game is that Villanova, when it did not turn the ball over, almost always scored.\" Each team had 17 rebounds, the fewest in any Final Four contest as of 2019.\nAftermath and legacy.\nA rule change in college basketball left teams unable to replicate Villanova's ball control strategy from the 1985 national championship game. After several conferences used a shot clock during the previous few seasons, the NCAA instituted a 45-second clock for the 1985–86 season. The clock was reduced to 35 seconds in 1993–94 and 30 in 2015–16.\nThe Wildcats lost multiple assistant coaches to other college positions in the years following the 1985 NCAA championship game. In the seven seasons Massimino spent as head coach at Villanova before leaving the program after the 1991–92 season, the team made it to the regional semifinals of the NCAA Tournament only once. The Wildcats did not return to the Final Four until 2009, and did not reach the championship game again until 2016, where they defeated North Carolina to end a 31-year championship drought. Villanova added a third championship two years later against Michigan.\nThe 1985–86 Georgetown team had an overall record of 24–8, and were eliminated in the second round of the 1986 NCAA Tournament by Michigan State. Georgetown's lone Final Four appearance since 1985 came in 2007, where they lost to Ohio State. The Hoyas were coached by Thompson's son, John Thompson III during their 2007 Final Four run.\nThe 1985 NCAA Tournament championship has been described as one of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history by numerous writers, including Jack Carey of \"USA Today\" and Matt Bonesteel of The Washington Post. As of 2021, the 1984–85 Villanova team is the lowest-seeded NCAA championship squad."

        "title": "2017 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 2017 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 2, 2017 at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California. This 103rd Rose Bowl Game matched the Big Ten Conference champions Penn State Nittany Lions against the USC Trojans of the Pac-12 Conference, a rematch of the 1923 and 2009 Rose Bowls, the former the first appearance for either team in the bowl and the latter the most recent appearance for either team. It was one of the 2016–17 bowl games that concluded the 2016 FBS football season. Sponsored by the Northwestern Mutual financial services organization, the game was officially known as the Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual. USC received the Lathrop K. Leishman trophy for winning the game.\nThe contest, played on January 2 in keeping with the game's standard practice when New Year's Day falls on a Sunday, was televised on ESPN with a radio broadcast on ESPN Radio and XM Satellite Radio, which began at 1:30 p.m. (PST) with kickoff at 2:10 p.m. (PST). The Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association was the organizer of the game. The Rose Bowl Game was a contractual sell-out, with 64,500 tickets allocated to the participating teams and conferences. The remaining tickets were distributed to the Tournament of Roses members, sponsors, City of Pasadena residents, and the general public. Ticket prices were $150 and $210. The bowl game was preceded by the 2017 Rose Parade, the 128th annual Rose Parade which began at 8:00 a.m. (PST) on game day with a theme of \"Echoes of Success.\"\nPre-game activities.\nThe game was presided over by the 2017 Rose Queen, the Royal Court, Tournament of Roses President Brad Ratliff, and the grand marshals Janet Evans, Allyson Felix, and Greg Louganis.\nAfter the teams' arrival in Southern California, the teams participated in the traditional Lawry's Beef Bowl in Beverly Hills and the Disney Media Day at the Disneyland Resort in nearby Anaheim. The Rose Bowl Hall of Fame ceremony luncheon was held prior to the game at the Rose Bowl, where outstanding former players and participants were inducted into the hall. This year's honorees were Bobby Bell, from the University of Minnesota; Ricky Ervins, University of Southern California; Tommy Prothro, Oregon State University and UCLA; and Art Spander, award-winning sportswriter.\nThe bands and cheerleaders from both schools participated in the pre-game Rose Parade on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena along with the floats.\nTeams.\nThe teams playing in the Rose Bowl game were the highest ranking teams from the Pac-12 Conference and Big Ten Conference that were not selected to play in a College Football Playoff semifinal game. The teams were officially selected by the football committee of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association on Selection Sunday on December 4, 2016, based on the final rankings by the CFP committee.\n#9 USC Trojans.\nThe Trojans started the year with a dismal 1–3 record, but after a Week 4 loss at No. 24 Utah the Trojans reeled off an eight-game winning streak, including an upset win over No. 4 Washington to break them into the Top 25 where they remained since. USC was led by freshman quarterback Sam Darnold, 1,000-yard rusher Ronald Jones II, receivers JuJu Smith-Schuster, Darreus Rogers and Deontay Burnett, defensive end Porter Gustin, and all-purpose player Adoree Jackson.\nThey were coached by Clay Helton, who led them to a 9–3 season (after going 5–4 in 9 games as interim head coach the season before). The team wore its white jerseys and used the east bench during the game.\n#5 Penn State Nittany Lions.\nThe Nittany Lions started the season off 2–2 after losses to Pitt and No. 4 Michigan but finished the regular season on a 9–game winning streak, including a pivotal 4th-quarter comeback victory over #2 Ohio State that led to Penn State receiving a Top-25 national ranking for the first time since 2011. Penn State added a Big Ten Championship with a comeback win over #6 Wisconsin to close out the season. The Nittany Lions were led by sophomore duo quarterback Trace McSorley and 1,000+ yard rusher Saquon Barkley and junior wide receiver Chris Godwin.\nThey came into the game 11–2 (8–1 Big Ten), a big improvement from the last two seasons under head coach James Franklin (finished 7–6 both seasons). The team wore its dark jerseys and used the west bench on game day.\nOther.\nThe Nittany Lions and Trojans had previously played nine times, with USC leading the series 5–4, and had played twice in the Rose Bowl in (1923 and 2009) with USC winning both games. The 2017 match was the highest scoring game in the bowl's history, with a total of 101 points, breaking the record set five years earlier at the 2012 Rose Bowl game. This record was broken in the 2018 Rose Bowl game with 102 points scored by both Oklahoma and Georgia.\nGame notes.\nRose Bowl records.\nIn this game, a number of new Rose Bowl records were set.\nPost-game.\nRatings.\nThe 2017 Rose Bowl drew more than 16 million viewers, making it the most-watched non-semifinal New Year’s Six game ever, and one of the most viewed college football games in history. Viewership was up 17% from the prior year’s 2016 Rose Bowl game between Stanford and Iowa. The telecast peaked at 19,656,000 viewers in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, which included USC’s game-winning field goal. Locally, Philadelphia (16.7) set a market record for the game, while in Pittsburgh (17.0) and Los Angeles (14.9) made it was the second highest-rated bowl game ever on ESPN.\nFigures do not include the 300,000 who streamed coverage on WatchESPN or other International streaming websites. If these figures were added to the final rating it would have been near the 19 million viewership range. Some countries who streamed the game on a national tv broadcast include Canada (1.3 million), France (200,000) and Australia (98,000)."

        "text": "Bruce T. Fraser (born December 18, 1964), nicknamed \"Q\", is an American basketball coach who is an assistant coach for player development for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Arizona Wildcats.\nEarly life.\nFraser was born and grew up in Long Beach, California, in a basketball family. Fraser's father, Bill Fraser, was a basketball coach for Wilson High School in Long Beach, the same high school Bruce later attended, for more than 15 years. In 1973, Bill replaced famed coach Lute Olson as the head coach for Long Beach City College, and would eventually become the college's winningest head coach by the time he retired in 1990.\nCollege and early career.\nFraser played basketball for the Long Beach City College team, coached by his father, for one year before transferring to the University of Arizona in 1984. He was the backup point guard for Arizona's basketball team for three years, from 1984 to 1987, before going into coaching upon graduation. Arizona was in the midst of a period of success on the national level under longtime head coach Lute Olson. In Arizona, Fraser saw little playing time as a reserve, but became known as a team player. Because he typically played short minutes late in games, Fraser referred to himself as a \"Gumby\" for his stiffness, and began carrying a small Gumby doll in his sock as a charm during games. Eventually, the entire Arizona bench in this era became known collectively as \"Gumbies\", taking on Fraser's label, and known for their exuberance. Also in Arizona, Fraser met and played alongside Steve Kerr, where they became close friends. Kerr reportedly gave Fraser his nickname, \"Q\", abbreviated from \"Question Man\", because he asked so many questions during his first week.\nAfter graduating, Fraser served as a graduate assistant for Arizona under coach Lute Olson from 1987–1989, including for the top-seeded 1988 team that made Arizona's first Final Four appearance. Fraser later recalled that appearance as his favorite memory during his time in Arizona.\nAfter leaving Arizona, Fraser left basketball and returned to the Los Angeles area spending 3 years working in sound and music for 20th Century Fox. Fraser worked on such films as \"Home Alone\" and \"Schindler's List\".\nWhile visiting friend and former Arizona basketball teammate Sean Elliott during his tenure for the San Antonio Spurs, Fraser was introduced to then-head coach—and future Hall of Famer—Larry Brown. Missing basketball, Fraser returned to the sport with his first NBA job as a volunteer coach under Brown, now coaching the Indiana Pacers, for the 1994–1995 season that ended with an Eastern Conference Finals appearance.\nAfter his season with the Pacers, Fraser moved on to leverage his knowledge of the basketball world as the sports marketing manager for Oakley from 1995 to May 1999. Fraser managed many high-profile accounts for Oakley, including Michael Jordan and Alonzo Mourning, as well as leading the company's relationships with many college athletics departments.\nFraser joined the University of Missouri coaching staff as an assistant coach for the 1999–2000 season under head coach Quin Snyder.\nNBA career.\nIn 2004, Fraser joined the Phoenix Suns as a scout, reuniting with former Arizona teammate Steve Kerr, who was part of the team's new ownership group and later became general manager. As scout, Fraser was primarily responsible for scouting the west coast college players for the Suns. After several years as scout, Fraser, a former point guard himself, also became the personal coach and workout partner for Steve Nash under Kerr's management. According to Kerr, Fraser trained Nash over summers during the last four years of Nash's NBA playing career.\nIn May 2014, Kerr was hired as head coach for the Golden State Warriors. Kerr brought on an entirely new coaching staff, and on July 3, 2014, the team announced Fraser was being hired as an assistant coach. As the player development coach, Fraser's primary role is working with players on improving skills. With his experience working with Nash, a top point guard, one of Fraser's main roles has been working out with Stephen Curry. Curry—widely considered the best shooter in NBA history—works with Fraser after every practice, especially focusing on the mechanics of his shot; Fraser typically works with Curry on the court, including facilitating Curry's workout routine of taking 500 3-point shots every practice. Fraser was also described as the \"emotional barometer of the team\", and sees himself as tracking the team's mental state and able to communicate the feelings of the team to Kerr, due to their closeness. All of the Warriors assistant coaches share advance scouting duties for the other NBA teams of upcoming games, with Fraser responsible for six teams.\nFraser won his first NBA Championship with the 2014–2015 Warriors team, which defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–2 in the NBA Finals.\nIn September 2015, it was reported that Steve Nash was joining the Warriors as a player development consultant to work alongside Fraser training Curry and other guards. Nash's friendship with Fraser and Kerr from their time in Phoenix was important in attracting him to Golden State.\nFraser won his second NBA Championship in three years with the 2016–2017 Warriors team, which defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–1 in the NBA Finals.\nFraser won his third NBA Championship in four years with the 2017–2018 Warriors team, which defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–0 in the NBA Finals.\nFraser won his fourth NBA Championship with the 2021–2022 Warriors team, which defeated the Boston Celtics 4–2 in the NBA Finals.\nFraser currently lives in San Diego, as does fellow Warriors coach Steve Kerr."

The country won three golds, a silver, and a bronze, with Lene Køppen winning gold in both singles and mixed doubles event. At the second edition in Jakarta 1980, the host country sent their players to the finals round in all events. Indonesia had won four titles, except in women's doubles taken by the English pair, Christian Hadinata secured two golds in the men's and mixed doubles events. China and South Korea made their first appearance in the third edition in Copenhagen 1983, and the Chinese team topped the medal standing by winning the women's singles and doubles. China won the remaining three titles in Calgary 1985 and made a truly indelible mark on the next edition by sweeping all five gold medals in Beijing 1987.\nAt the age of 18, Ratchanok Intanon became the youngest winner of a singles title at the Championships. Ratchanok was less than 3 months older than Jang Hye-ock was when she won the women's doubles title at the 1995 Championships.\nIn Nanjing 2018, Kento Momota became the first Japanese player to win the gold medal in the men's singles event, also in 2015, he secured first medal for Japan in the men's singles by winning a bronze.\nIn Basel 2019, for the first time since 1983, China only had one representative in the final round. P.V. Sindhu became the first Indian player to win the gold medal at the World Championships and also became the only other woman singles player along with China's Zhang Ning to have won five World Championship medals. Japanese Kento Momota, and the duo Mayu Matsumoto and Wakana Nagahara retained their titles from the previous edition. Japanese mixed doubles pair Yuta Watanabe and Arisa Higashino and the Thai men's singles player Kantaphon Wangcharoen, became the first players from their countries that won medals in the mixed doubles and men's singles events respectively."

Since 2008, the team has played an annual fixture against the New South Wales Under-18 team as a curtain raiser to a State of Origin game. The team features players selected from Queensland's premier under-18 rugby league competition, the Mal Meninga Cup. They are administered by the Queensland Rugby League.\nHistory.\nPrior to 2008, junior interstate matches were contested at under-17 and under-19 levels. In 2008, with the advent of the National Youth Competition, the age levels switched to an under-16 and under-18 format to keep in line with the NSWRL's existing SG Ball Cup and Harold Matthews Cup competitions and the QRL's Mal Meninga Cup and Cyril Connell Cup competitions, which would begin in 2009.\nQueensland suffered defeat in the first four under-18 Origin fixtures, not winning a game until 2012. The 2012 team, which featured future NRL players Anthony Milford, Kodi Nikorima and Lloyd Perrett, held on to defeat New South Wales 24–18 at ANZ Stadium in Sydney. Queensland would suffer two more defeats in 2013 and 2014 before picking up their second win in 2015, defeating New South Wales 22–18 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Queensland snapped a three-game losing streak with a victory in 2019.\nPlayers.\nPlayers selected for the Queensland under-18 team are usually contracted with a National Rugby League (NRL) side but play in either the Mal Meninga Cup, Hastings Deering Colts, Jersey Flegg Cup or Intrust Super Cup competitions. In 2008, before the Mal Meninga Cup began, players were selected from the under-18 representative carnival in Proserpine. Each pre-season the Queensland Rugby League will select an under-18 squad featuring players in contention for the mid-season fixture. The squad participates in a weekend camp at the Queensland Academy of Sport.\n2020 squad.\nThe 34-man training squad selected for the 2020 season:\nNotable players.\nSince 2008, twenty-two former Queensland under-18 players have gone onto represent Queensland at State of Origin level:"

        "text": "The 2015–16 season was Irish provincial rugby union side Connacht Rugby's fifteenth season competing in the Pro12, and the team's twentieth season as a professional side. It was Pat Lam's third season in charge of the side. Connacht finished the season as league champions after defeating Leinster in the 2016 Pro12 Grand Final, the team's first trophy in its 131-year history.\nAs well as playing in the Pro12, Connacht competed in the Challenge Cup in Europe, having lost a play-off to enter the Champions Cup. The second-tier side the Connacht Eagles competed in the 2015–16 British and Irish Cup.\nBackground.\nCompetition schedule.\nHaving finished seventh in the 2014–15 Pro12 Connacht were entered into a play-off to qualify for the 2015–16 Champions Cup, but were beaten by Gloucester after extra time. Following this defeat, Connacht were entered into the Challenge Cup. On 17 June 2015, Connacht were drawn into Pool 1 of the tournament along with French Top 14 side Brive, Newcastle Falcons from the English Premiership and Russian side Enisey-STM, who had entered the tournament through a qualifying competition.\nThe early stages of the season were interrupted by the 2015 Rugby World Cup leading to a congested fixture list after the tournament ended. Due to this fixture pile up, Connacht were scheduled to play a game each week for 16 straight weeks after the tournament ended.\nPersonnel changes.\nThe team came into the season without their long-serving forwards coach Dan McFarland, following his move to Glasgow Warriors. McFarland had joined Connacht as a player in 2000, where he retired and moved into coaching with the side. He was replaced in the role by Jimmy Duffy, who had previously worked for the province's academy.\nOn the playing front, the close season saw the retirement of Michael Swift, the team's former captain who had made a record 269 appearances for the province, 184 of these coming in the league, a competition record. The close season also saw the departure of centurion Mils Muliaina to Zebre one season after joining Connacht, and the previous season's loan transfers of John Cooney and Quinn Roux made permanent, while lock Mick Kearney re-joined his home province of Leinster with Ben Marshall going in the opposite direction.\nSeason.\nPre-season.\nConnacht players returned to training for pre-season on 29 June 2015. Robbie Henshaw and Kieran Marmion were not involved, having returned to training with the squad earlier in the month, ahead of the World Cup in September. Nathan White was later called into the squad, following an injury to Marty Moore. Marmion did not make the final squad for the tournament.\nConnacht played three friendlies in the run up to the season. On 7 August they faced French Top 14 side FC Grenoble, coached by former Connacht player Bernard Jackman, and were beaten 19–52 at home. The following week saw another friendly against Top 14 side, with the team travelling to France to face Castres. Connacht were beaten again, this time by a score of 19–5. The side's final pre-season game came on 21 August, when they faced Irish rivals Munster in Thomond Park. Putting out a near full strength side, Connacht won their final warm up game 12–28.\nSeptember.\nThe opening game of the season was a home game Pro12 game against the Newport Gwent Dragons, with Connacht winning 29–23. The following week saw the team travel to Scotland to face reigning champions Glasgow Warriors. After being down 23–6 at half-time, Connacht battled back in the second half but were ultimately to 33–32, earning two bonus points for the performance. Following the second round, the league took a two-week break.\nOctober.\nThe competition resumed in October, with Connacht facing Cardiff Blues in Galway, earning a try bonus point with a 36–31 victory. The following week saw the team face Zebre, which yielded another bonus point win. On 26 October, Connacht traveled to the Liberty Stadium to face the Ospreys who had been champions four times in the past. A 16–21 victory saw Connacht win away to the Welsh side for the first time since 2004. On Halloween night, the team hosted Edinburgh at the Sportsgrounds, with a 14–9 victory the result.\nNovember.\nOn 6 November, Connacht faced Benetton Treviso in Galway, winning 33–19 without collecting a try bonus. The league then took a hiatus to allow European competitions, which had been delayed by the World Cup, to take place. Connacht's opening game in the Challenge Cup saw them face Russian side Enisei-STM in Krasnoyarsk. This meant a near 6,000 kilometre trip to the Siberian city, taking nine hours across two flights for the 24 man squad that traveled. The game was played in temperatures below –20 °C, but Connacht ultimately emerged as 14–31 victors, taking all five points in the process. However, after the game Connacht's return home was delayed. A fault was found with the charter plane before takeoff. This meant alternate plans had to be made, and the travelling party was split into three, with the groups arriving back in Ireland via Amsterdam, London and Paris. Having planned to leave on the night of the game, the latest returning players had been delayed by three days, arriving on Tuesday night with a game against French side Brive to come on Saturday. Despite the travel chaos and delayed return, Connacht defeated Brive 21–17 to go top of their pool.\nConnacht returned to Pro12 action on 28 November in their first inter-provincial derby of the season, facing Munster in Thomond Park. Having not won at the venue for 29 years, Connacht pulled off a 12–18 upset, their seventh win from the eight league games played. This left the team top of both the league and their European pool going into December.\nDecember.\nConnacht's first game in December was away to Cardiff Blues, which ended in a 20–16 defeat. On 11 December, Connacht faced the Newcastle Falcons in Galway in the Challenge Cup, winning 25–10. A week later saw the return fixture take place in Kingston Park, with Connacht losing 29–5. This left Connacht top of the pool on 13 points, with Newcastle two points behind. In the final game of 2015 Connacht faced Ulster in Galway on St. Stephen's Day, losing 3–10.\nJanuary.\nConnacht's first game of 2016 took place on New Year's Day, when they traveled to the RDS Arena to take on Leinster, a game which ended in a 13–0 defeat. On 10 January, the team faced Scarlets in Wales, and were beaten 21–19, taking their Pro12 losing streak to four games. The following week saw a return to European competition, with Connacht travelling to France to face Brive in a game they lost 21–18. The following week, they faced Enisei-STM in Galway, winning 47–5 to top the group. The losses to Brive and Newcastle meant that the team qualified for the quarter-finals with the lowest points tally of the group winners, meaning they would be the away team in their quarter-final, being drawn to face Grenoble, the fourth-highest finishing group winner. On 30 January, Connacht faced Scarlets in the Sportsgrounds and won 30–17, their first Pro12 victory since November.\nFebruary.\nThere was no game in the first week of February due to the beginning of the Six Nations Championship. On 11 February, Connacht faced Newport Gwent Dragons in Rodney Parade, beating them 21–26 and earning a try bonus point to go back to the top of the table. The following week saw the team play Zebre in Italy, a game they won 34–51. In their final game of the month, Connacht faced the Ospreys in the Sportsground, winning 30–22 to extend their lead at the top of the league table.\nMarch.\nOn 4 March, Connacht faced Edinburgh in Murrayfield and won with a bonus point to maintain their position as league leaders. A break for the end of the Six Nations meant that only two games were played in March. In the second game, Connacht faced second-placed Leinster at home in an inter-provincial derby on 26 March, with a 7–6 victory seeing them extend their lead.\nApril.\nOn 1 April, Connacht faced Ulster in Kingspan Stadium with an 18–10 defeat ending their six-game winning streak in the league. The following week saw a return to European action, with the Challenge Cup quarter-final against Grenoble taking place. Despite scoring four tries, Connacht were on the wrong side of a 33–32 scoreline. The team returned to league action on 16 April with another inter-provincial game, this time against Munster. A bonus point win left the team in second place ahead of Glasgow with two rounds to go. Connacht then traveled to Italy to face bottom side Treviso, but in a shocking upset, the Italians won by a score of 22–21 thanks to a last gasp penalty from Jayden Hayward. However, the losing bonus point was enough to guarantee Connacht a top four finish and a first ever spot in the end-of-year playoffs.\nMay.\nOn 7 May, Connacht faced Glasgow Warriors in a game that would decide home advantage for the playoff round. Connacht won 14–7 thanks to tries from Bundee Aki and Tiernan O'Halloran, to set up a home semi-final against the same opposition. That semi-final took place on 21 May, with Connacht finishing 16–11 victors to set up a final against Leinster, the province's first final in the professional era.\nThe final took place on 28 May in Murrayfield. Connacht won the game 20–10, with tries from O'Halloran, Niyi Adeolokun and Matt Healy.

        "text": "Willie Anderson (born 17 September 1967 in Kirkcaldy, Scotland) is a former Scotland international rugby union player for Glasgow Warriors, who played at the Tighthead Prop position.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nAnderson started playing at amateur club Kirkcaldy RFC.\nProfessional career.\nWhen professionalism was introduced in Scotland, Anderson joined the Caledonia Reds side. No fewer than 9 Kirkcaldy players played in the Caledonia Reds team in the Heineken Cup of this era The Caledonia Reds won the first Scottish Inter-District Championship in the Scottish professional era in 1996–97 season.\nUnfortunately the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) could not afford four district teams at this time. They disbanded Caledonia Reds and merged the district into that of the Glasgow Warriors, which was known then as Glasgow Caledonians. Anderson was one of the lucky players that was taken on by the Glasgow side in 1998.\nAnderson went on to play with Glasgow to 2001; he struggled with injury in 2000 with a detached bicep muscle and mutually agreed to a release in his contract in January 2001. However he was later included in the Scotland A squad of March 2001.\nInternational career.\nInternationally, Anderson had 11 eleven appearances at Scotland 'A' and a test appearance against Spain in Rugby World Cup qualification. Jim Telfer said of Anderson's call up for the Spain match: \"Willie has been performing very well for Glasgow Caledonians this season and we want to give him a shot at this level to see how he does. Hopefully, this will be a stern test.\"\nThere had been calls for these test appearances - including in the Spain match - to be designated as a full Scotland cap by the SRU; Anderson is one of 30 players who could be retrospectively given a full Scotland cap if the SRU follows the Scottish Football Association's example and belatedly honours their players. Anderson said this of his wish for a full Scotland cap: \"I have been following and playing rugby since I was a small schoolkid, and it would be my ultimate ambition to get a Scotland cap.\" In August 2023 Anderson was included in a list of 56 players to be awarded international caps retrospectively for games not classed as Tests at the time.\nThis was finally done by the SRU on 15 August 2023.

        "text": "Maurício Luiz de Souza (born 29 September 1988) is a Brazilian politician, former volleyball player, member of the Brazil men's national volleyball team, 2016 Olympic Champion, silver medallist of the 2018 World Championship, gold medallist of the 2019 World Cup, three–time South American Champion (2013, 2015, 2017), 2014 Turkish Champion. He was sacked from the Minas Tênis Clube and the national team in October 2021 after sharing a post about Jon Kent, the son of Superman, being revealed to be bisexual.\nHe later joined the Liberal Party in 2022. He participated as a candidate in the parliamentary elections in the same year, being elected as a federal deputy from the state of Minas Gerais.\nPersonal life.\nMaurício Souza is married to Isabella Saldanha Castro and has two children, a girl and a boy.\nStatements about homosexuals.\nSouza has posted homophobic messages on his social networks in the past, which generated controversy. In 2014 he made a post against homosexuality but apologized after a public backlash. Another made in 2017 was removed ten hours later.\nIn 2021, Souza criticized the comic character Jonathan Samuel Kent, who in the DC Universe is the son of Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane, for being revealed as bisexual. After a negative reaction, Fiat and Gerdau, sponsors of Minas Tênis Clube, the team the athlete works for, demanded measures from the club's board of directors and repudiated the player's attitude. The sports team then decided to fine and temporarily remove Souza, in addition to stating that \"the player's opinions do not represent the beliefs of the partner sports institution\" and that he should recant. The organized supporters Independente Minas also released a statement in which it said it \"will ignore the athlete Maurício Souza in social networks, games and demonstrations\".\nAfter the controversy, Souza published a message of retraction for the statements on his Twitter account. However, on October 27, 2021, the team terminated their contract with him. Renan Dal Zotto, coach of the Brazilian Men's Volleyball Team, said he \"was disappointed\" with the conduct of Maurício Souza and that \"there is no room for homophobic professionals\" in the selection. As a result, Souza lost his place within the national team. 20 federal deputies from 13 states and seven political parties lodged complaints against him with the Public Ministry of Minas Gerais.\nPolitics.\nSouza is a public supporter of Jair Bolsonaro. Shortly after the defeat of the Brazilian volleyball team at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, he was received by Jair Bolsonaro and his son, Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL), at Palácio do Planalto, in Brasília. On the occasion, Souza presented the politicians with t-shirts of the Brazilian volleyball team. His support for the Bolsonaro family had been known since 2018, when he and Wallace de Souza, his national team partner, went viral on the internet after posing for a photo in which they made, with their fingers, the number 17, which represented Bolsonaro in the ballot boxes during the 2018 Brazilian presidential election.\nAfter his firing for his homophobic comments, Souza joined the Liberal Party in March 2022 to run for the position of federal deputy for Minas Gerais in the 2022 election. Souza said that he was running because there was a need for more officials who supported President Jair Bolsonaro. He won by a margin of over 83,000 votes."

Taking place in Reno, Nevada for the second straight season, the event included four \"animal\" oil pattern events (Cheetah, Chameleon, Scorpion and Shark). While each provide individual PBA titles, the four pattern tournaments in WSOB VIII also served as initial qualifying for the PBA World Championship. The top 25% of players in total pinfall over the 32 games of qualifying (8 games per pattern tournament) moved on to the PBA World Championship cashers round, and bowled an additional six games of qualifying on the PBA World Championship oil pattern to determine the top 24. Three additional match play rounds of eight games each determined the field for the televised finals. The WSOB field announced on November 16 included participants from a record 22 countries.\nSeveral international tour stops, which are part of the World Bowling Tour (WBT), were again part of the PBA schedule. As in 2015, a PBA title was awarded for any qualifying WBT tournaments won by a PBA member. For the second straight season, some tournaments formerly consigned as PBA Regional Tour stops now qualified the winner to earn a PBA title in addition to a minimum $10,000 top prize for each event. These nine tour stops were designated as \"Xtra Frame\" tournaments, because they are broadcast exclusively (start-to-finish) on the PBA's Xtra Frame webcast service. For 2016, the Xtra Frame series had a rolling points list, with a $10,000 bonus given to the player with the most points after all eight Xtra Frame singles events were completed. (Note: The Xtra Frame series was shortened to seven singles events when the PBA Xtra Frame Tamarac Classic in Florida was cancelled due to Hurricane Matthew.) Tommy Jones was the bonus winner with 89 points, surpassing E. J. Tackett (84 points) in the final Xtra Frame event of the season.\nAfter three seasons, the PBA dropped the \"Summer Swing\" series that had taken place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (2013) and Shawnee, Oklahoma (2014–15), in favor of a Fall Swing series that took place September 5–11 in Allen Park, Michigan. Oil patterns and event structure, however, were the same as the previous Summer Swing series. The Swing features the shortest and longest oil patterns used in any PBA tournament (32-foot \"Wolf\" and 52-foot \"Badger\"), plus a 40-foot U.S. Open-style pattern (\"Bear\").\nSeason highlights.\nYoung players dominated the major tournaments in 2016:\nAdditional highlights:\nAwards for the 2016 season were as follows:\nTournament summary.\nBelow is a schedule of events for the 2016 PBA Tour season.

He played at fly-half for Glasgow Caledonians, now Glasgow Warriors; as well as Racing 92 and Saracens among others.\nHe signed for Glasgow in 1998 from Border Bulldogs in South Africa. He was Scottish-qualified as his grandmother, Rachel Watson, was from Edinburgh.\nHe made the move in the hope of representing Scotland. He stated: \"After being sidelined for two years because of a serious knee injury, I made up my mind to continue my career in Europe. When I told my agent about my family background, he set about getting me fixed up with a Scottish team. The ultimate goal for any player is to play at international level and as soon as I found out that I could be eligible for Scotland, my sights were set.\"\nHowever, injury prevented him from receiving Scotland 'A' or Scotland 'B' honours and the hope of a Scotland career stalled. He did however represent a combined Scottish Districts side.\nHe played two matches in the Heineken Cup for Glasgow; against US Colomiers and Pontypridd. He also played in the Scottish Inter-District Championship and in that season's WRU Challenge Cup.\nHe also played for Glasgow in friendlies against touring international sides South Africa and the Māori All Blacks and Fiji.\nAfter playing for Glasgow, Smith moved to Racing 92 and then Rotherham. He played just 5 matches for Rotherham before signing for Saracens.\nSmith also played for Mirano Rugby in Italy; and Birmingham &amp; Solihull, Coventry and Esher in England.\nSchooled at Selborne College in East London and Dale College Boys' High School in King William's Town, South Africa, Smith returned to his former school as rugby coach.\nSmith died suddenly on 16 July 2021."

He faced compatriot Pablo Carreño Busta in the first round and managed a comeback by defeating him in three sets. He then defeated Robin Haase in straight sets but then required three sets to defeat Andrey Kuznetsov in the quarter-finals. Nadal then defeated Illya Marchenko in the semifinals in straight sets to advance to the final, where he faced Novak Djokovic for the title. Nadal was crushed, winning just three games in a straight sets defeat, and thus lost his lead in his head-to-head record against Djokovic for the first time.\nAustralian Open.\nNadal suffered a shocking defeat in the first round of the 2016 Australian Open at the hands of his compatriot Fernando Verdasco in five gruelling sets. This marked only the second time in his entire professional career that he has lost in the first round of a grand slam singles tournament. The only other first round loss was to Steve Darcis at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships.\nSouth American Clay Court Season.\nArgentina Open.\nAfter receiving a bye in the first round, Nadal reached the semifinals of the Argentina Open by defeating Juan Mónaco and Paolo Lorenzi respectively in straight sets. However, he lost to an in-form young-gun Dominic Thiem in the semifinals in three sets after squandering 2 match points.\nRio Open.\nNadal opens his Rio Open campaign by defeating compatriots Pablo Carreño Busta and Nicolás Almagro respectively in straight sets to book his place in the quarterfinals. He got a walkthrough to the semifinals after Alexandr Dolgopolov withdrew due to a right-shoulder injury. He eventually lost to Pablo Cuevas in the semifinals.\nMarch Masters.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nAfter receiving a bye in the first round, Nadal recorded his first win after changing back to his old racket against Gilles Müller in three tight sets and booked his place in the fourth round winning his rematch against Fernando Verdasco in straight sets. Nadal reaches the quarterfinals for the second straight year after saving a match point against rising star Alexander Zverev to beat him in three gruelling-sets. He defeated Kei Nishikori in straight sets for his first top 10 win of the season to advance to the semifinals. He lost to Novak Djokovic 7–6, 6–2 in the semifinal after squandering a set point on Djokovic's serve in the first set making their head-to-head record 25–23 in Djokovic's favor.\nMiami Masters.\nAfter a bye in the first round, Nadal lost to Damir Džumhur in the second round, retiring in the third set of their match citing dizziness due to the extreme heat at the end of the first set.\nEuropean Clay Court Season.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nAfter receiving a bye in the first round, Nadal defeated Aljaž Bedene in straight sets and faced a more stringent test in the third round against the in-form Dominic Thiem. After two hours on the court, Nadal came out victorious, beating Thiem in straight sets 7–5, 6–3. Nadal reached the semifinals of the Monte Carlo Rolex Masters for the 2nd straight year after a dominant straight sets win in the quarterfinals against 2015 French Open champion Stan Wawrinka. After dropping the first set in the semifinals 2–6 to world #2 Andy Murray, Nadal rallied to beat Murray 6–4, 6–2, upping his head-to-head record against Murray to 17–6. In the final, Nadal defeated an in-form Gaël Monfils in three tough sets, winning 7–5, 5–7, 6–0 to claim his 9th Monte Carlo masters trophy, ending a nearly 2-years Masters 1000 title drought since his last Masters title in Madrid 2014. After leading the Masters 1000 title tally for several years Nadal was surpassed by Novak Djokovic in Miami 2016 but the Monte Carlo win ensures that Nadal is again tied with Djokovic for a record of 28 masters titles.\nBarcelona Open.\nAfter a first round bye, Nadal continued his dominant form by dispatching compatriots Marcel Granollers and Albert Montañés in straight sets to proceed to the Quarterfinals.

        "text": "The Bangladesh cricket team toured India in February 2017 to play one Test match. It was the first time that Bangladesh toured India. Initially the tour was scheduled to take place in August 2016, but with other commitments made by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said that the first week of February looked more likely. The date of the Test was confirmed in August 2016. In January 2017 the BCCI moved the date back by one day. The Decision Review System (DRS) was used in the Test match.\nAhead of the Test match, there was a two-day tour match between India A and Bangladesh. Bangladesh's captain Mushfiqur Rahim downplayed the historic nature of the tour saying \"we want to play in such a way that India invites again and again. This to me is just another Test match\". India won the Test match by 208 runs.\nDuring the Test match, India set several individual and team records. In their first innings, both Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli set individual batting records. Pujara passed the total for the most runs by a batsman in an Indian first-class season, with a total of 1,605. The previous record was 1,604 runs, set by Chandu Borde in the 1964–65 season. Kohli set a new record for the most Test runs in a home season, with 1,168. Virender Sehwag held the old record, when he made 1,105 runs in the 2004–05 season. Kohli also became the first player to score a double-century in four consecutive Test series. The previous best was three consecutive series, held jointly by Don Bradman and Rahul Dravid. Ravichandran Ashwin became the fastest player, in terms of number of Tests, to take 250 wickets. He achieved it in 45 matches, beating the previous quickest of 48 Tests, set by Dennis Lillee.\nIndia's first innings total of 687 declared was the first time that a team had made a score of 600 plus in three consecutive innings in Tests. Their win in this Test gave them their sixth consecutive series win, their best in Tests. The streak started with a series win against Sri Lanka in September 2015. With this series win against Bangladesh, it gave Virat Kohli his nineteenth successive Test without a defeat, the most for any captain of India.\nFor Bangladesh, Mushfiqur Rahim became their fourth player to reach 3,000 runs in Tests. By the end of the match, he was Bangladesh's third-highest run-scorer in Tests, moving ahead of Habibul Bashar.\nSquads.\nBangladesh's Imrul Kayes was injured during the tour match and was replaced by Mosaddek Hossain. India's Amit Mishra suffered an injury during the final Twenty20 International match against England on 1 February. He was replaced by Kuldeep Yadav."

        "text": "Jasjit Singh (born 4 February 1948) is a former professional tennis player from India.\nBiography.\nSingh, who was born in New Delhi, became the first Sikh to play for the India Davis Cup team when he was selected in the side during the 1974 Davis Cup. His first appearance was a loss to Japan's Toshiro Sakai in a dead rubber, as India had already secured the tie. India then faced the Australian team in the Eastern Zone final and Jasjit was chosen ahead of Anand Amritraj to play the first singles rubber. In front of a Calcutta crowd, Singh managed to beat his Australian opponent Bob Giltinan in four sets, to give India a 1–0 lead. A win by John Alexander was cancelled out by a win to India in the doubles, which meant that Singh had a chance to secure the tie in the reverse singles against Alexander. He was unable to beat Alexander, but India won the tie 3–2 after Vijay Amritraj defeated Giltinan in the deciding match. The next fixture for India was the Inter-Zone semi-final, which they won over the Soviet Union, to qualify for the Davis Cup final. Singh didn't feature in that tie and didn't get a chance to play in the final against South Africa, as the Indians forfeited in protest of the apartheid regime.\nOn the Grand Prix tennis circuit he made quarter-finals at Buenos Aires in 1972 and at his home event in New Delhi in 1973. He was a doubles finalist with Marcello Lara in the 1977 Indian Open, held in Bombay.\nHe competed in the main singles draw of all four Grand Slam tournaments. His greatest success came in the mixed doubles, a quarter-final appearance at the 1973 US Open, with Ilana Kloss.\nSince retiring he has lived in New York."

        "title": "1949/1950 News of the World Snooker Tournament",
        "text": "The 1949/1950 News of the World Snooker Tournament was a professional snooker tournament sponsored by the \"News of the World\". The tournament was won by Joe Davis with Sidney Smith finishing in second place. It was the first News of the World Tournament, a tournament that ran until 1959.\nFormat.\nThe 1949/1950 event was a round-robin snooker tournament and was played from 10 October 1949 to 21 January 1950. All matches were played at Leicester Square Hall in London. There were 8 competitors and a total of 28 matches. The competitors were Joe Davis, Walter Donaldson, George Chenier, Horace Lindrum, Sidney Smith, Peter Mans and Albert Brown. Each match lasted three days and was the best of 37 frames. There was a qualifying competition prior to the main event. This involved 4 players in a round-robin tournament with the winner, Albert Brown, advancing to the main event. 1949 World Snooker Champion Fred Davis did not enter as he objected to the matches being over only three days rather than the normal six.\nEach player was given a handicap at the start of the tournament. The handicaps were: Davis: -7, Donaldson: 0, Chenier, Lindrum and Smith: 13, Pulman: 14, Mans: 16 and Brown: 19. The player with the higher handicap received a start in each frame, being the difference between the two handicaps. Thus Brown received a 3-point start in his match against Mans.\nResults.\nThe two top-seeded players met in the first match. Joe Davis beat Walter Donaldson, won a tough match; taking a winning 19–16 lead in the final session. In the second match Albert Brown, receiving a 26-point start each frame, led Joe Davis 18–6 after two days and won comfortably.\nGoing into his last match Albert Brown seemed the likely winner of the tournament. He and Joe Davis had won 5 matches out of 6 but Brown had an 8 frame lead. This meant that if Brown won his last match 19–18, Davis would need to win his last match 28–9 to win the event. However Brown lost his last match, against Horace Lindrum, which meant that Davis only needed to win his match against George Chenier to win the tournament. In the next match Sidney Smith won 26–11, overtaking Brown in the standings and meaning that Smith would win the tournament if Davis lost. Davis took a 19–4 lead against Chenier to guarantee the £500 first prize with Smith in second place and Brown third.\nJoe Davis scored the first century of the tournament on 8 November in his match against John Pulman. Pulman potted a red before Davis cleared the table with a break of 130. Davis scored a break of exactly 100 against Sidney Smith on 3 January. George Chenier scored a break of 107 on 19 January in his match against Davis.\nTable\nThe positions were determined firstly by the number of matches won (MW) and, in the event of a tie, the number of frames won (FW). Albert Brown won an additional £50 for winning the qualifying competition.\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying tournament was played from 19 September to 8 October 1949. These matches were also played at Leicester Square Hall in London. As in the main event, each match lasted three days and was the best of 37 frames. Albert Brown and Alec Brown each won their first two matches which meant that the final match, between the two, would decide the winner. Albert Brown won a close match 20–17. Alec had led 13–11 at the start of the final day. Conrad Stanbury conceded his match against John Barrie because of illness. Barrie was leading 8–4 at the time. Barrie played a two-day exhibition match against Peter Mans instead."

        "title": "FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship",
        "text": "The FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship is an international volleyball competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of \"\" (FIVB), the sport's global governing body. The initial gap between championships was variable, but since 1962 they were held every four years. The tournament will be held biennially starting in 2025.\nThe current champion is Italy, who won their fourth title at the 2022 tournament, defeating Poland in the final.\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the \"World Championship Finals\". The former format was 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\nThe 20 World Championship tournaments have been won by seven different national teams: the Soviet Union six times; Italy four times; Brazil and Poland three times each; Czechoslovakia twice; and East Germany and the United States, once each.\nHistory.\nThe history of the World Championship goes back to the beginnings of volleyball as a professional, high level sport. One of the first concrete measures taken by the FIVB after its foundation in 1947 was the establishment of an international competition involving teams from more than one continent. In 1949, the first edition was played in Prague, Czechoslovakia. At that point, the tournament was still restricted to Europe.\nThree years later, the event was expanded to include nations from Asia, and began to be held in 4-year cycles. By the following edition, there were also teams from South, Central and North America.\nSince volleyball was to be added to the Olympic Program in 1964, the 4-cycles were advanced in 2 years after the fourth edition (1960), so that the World Championship may alternate with the Summer Olympic Games. As of 1970, teams from Africa also took part in the competition, and the original goal of having members from all five continental confederations in the games was achieved.\nThe number of teams involved in the games has changed significantly over the years. Following volleyball's increase in popularity, they raised steadily to over 20 in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, were then cut short to 16 in the 1990s, and finally set up in 24 after 2002. Today, the World Championship is the most comprehensive of all events organized by the FIVB, and arguably the most important, alongside the Olympic Games.\nUntil 1974, the host nation of the tournament organized both the men's and the women's events, with the single exception of the 1966/1967 games, which took place in different years. Since 1978, this practice has been only occasionally observed, for instance, in 1998 and in the 2006 edition, which was held, as the former was, in Japan.\nOn 15 October 2022, FIVB announced the expansion of World Championships and the changes to the competition formula. A total of 32 teams are to compete for future editions of the tournament.\nOn 22 June, 2023, Volleyball Calendar 2025–2028 approved by FIVB shown that World Championships to be played biannually in odd years. The first reformed World Championships will be held in 2025 with 32 teams in new formula.\nWinners.\nThe history of the World Championship clearly demonstrates how volleyball was originally dominated by European nations.\nThe first two editions were won by the Soviet Union. In 1956, twice runner-up Czechoslovakia took the gold. There followed two more consecutive wins for the Soviet Union, in both cases over Czechoslovakia. The Czechs won a gold medal in the 1966 edition.\nIn 1970, East Germany prevailed over Bulgaria for their first and only title. In 1974, the Soviet Union threatened to take the lead once more, but ended up being defeated by Poland at the final. Nevertheless, they would confirm their leadership by winning, for the third time, two editions in a row.\n1986 saw the first relevant confrontation between United States, the rising major force of the decade, and the traditional leader Soviet Union after the Olympic boycotts of 1980 and 1984. As would be the case two years later at the Seoul Olympic Games, the issue was settled in favour of the Americans led by Karch Kiraly and Steve Timmons. Italy completely dominated the competition in the 1990s, winning all the editions that took place in this decade (1990, 1994, 1998), led by such players as Lorenzo Bernardi and Andrea Giani.\nIn the 2000s, Brazil became the leading force in the sport, also winning three consecutive editions (2002, 2006 and 2010), the first of which in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the same stage where the Brazilians had been runners-up in 1982.

        "title": "FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship",
        "text": "The FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship is an international volleyball competition contested by the senior women's national teams of the members of \"\" (FIVB), the sport's global governing body. The initial gap between championships was variable, but since 1970 they have been awarded every four years. The tournament will be held biennially starting in 2025.\nThe current champions are the Serbia, which won their second title at the 2022 tournament in Netherlands and Poland.\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the \"World Championship Finals\". 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\nThe 19 World Championship tournaments have been won by eight different national teams. Soviet Union have won five times. The other World Championship winners are Japan and Cuba, with three titles each; China, Russia and Serbia, with two titles each; and Italy and the United States, with one title each.\nHistory.\nThe history of the World Championship goes back to the beginnings of volleyball as a professional, high level sport. One of the first concrete measures taken by the FIVB after its foundation in 1947 was the establishment of an international competition involving teams from more than one continent. In 1949, the first edition of the Men's World Championship was played in Prague, Czechoslovakia. At that point, the tournament was still restricted to Europe.\nThree years later, a women's version was introduced; the events were synchronized and expanded to include nations from Asia, and began to be held in 4-year cycles. By the following edition, there were also teams from South, Central and North America.\nSince volleyball was to be added to the Olympic Program in 1964, the 4-cycles were advanced in 2 years after the fourth edition (1960), so that the World Championship may alternate with the Summer Olympics. As of 1970, teams from Africa also took part in the competition, and the original goal of having members from all five continental confederations in the games was achieved.\nThe number of teams involved in the games has changed significantly over the years. Following volleyball's increase in popularity, they raised steadily to over 20 in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, were then cut short to 16 in the 1990s, and finally set up in 24 after 2002. Today, the World Championship is the most comprehensive of all events organized by the FIVB, and arguably the second most important, surpassed in prestige only by the Olympic Games.\nUntil 1974, the host nation of the tournament organized both the men's and the women's events, with the single exception of the 1966/1967 games, which took place in different years. Since 1978, this practice has been only occasionally observed, for instance, in 1998 and in the 2006 edition, which was held, as the former was, in Japan.\nOn 15 October 2022, FIVB announced the expansion of the World Championships and the changes to their common competition formula. A total of 32 teams are to compete for future editions of the tournament.\nOn 22 June 2023, Volleyball Calendar 2025–2028 approved by FIVB shown that World Championships to be played biannually in odd years. The first reformed World Championships will be held in 2025 with 32 teams in new formula.\nWinners.\nIf the titles of the Women's World Championship are evenly distributed between European and non-Europeans national teams, the situation is quite different when nations are taken into account. Historically, four national teams dominated at the World Championships — Russia (formerly participated as Soviet Union), Japan, China and Cuba (except for Italy's single — and for many, unexpected — victory in 2002). However, at last tournaments, two national teams became triumphants for the first time — United States in 2014 and Serbia in 2018.\nThe Soviets made a most impressive start by winning the first three editions of the tournament: 1952, 1956, 1960. They were halfway to making it four, since the following edition was to be played in Moscow. Former runners-up Japan, nevertheless, was the champions in 1962 and interrupted the winning streak, repeating the performance in 1967, when the Soviet Union national team did not participate.\nThe teams faced each other again in 1970, and this time the Soviet Union beat their opponents to collect the gold. In the following edition, Japan took revenge and defeated the Soviet Union in straight sets. Then something extraordinary happened: the world watched astonished as a young Cuban squad left behind the two longtime rivals and secured the first important volleyball title for a continent other than Europe or Asia.\nThe early 1980s saw the rise of a new Asian force: led by superstar Lang Ping, China stamped their mark on the World Championship's history by winning two editions in a row (1982 and 1986). They also made it to the finals in 1990, but were overpowered by the Soviet Union in their last participation at the competition.\nCuba's 1978 title finally fructified in an aggressive style of play that virtually dominated the 1990s. Led by powerplayers Regla Torres, Mireya Luis and Regla Bell, the Caribbeans won the 1994 and 1998 editions of the World Championship, beating newbies as well as tradition rivals such as Russia and China.\nIn spite of being appointed as favourites in 2002, China lost at the semifinals to a rising Italy, which would eventually win the final against United States\nIn 2006, favourites Brazil couldn't stop Russia and lost the gold medal match in a shocking final tie-breaker. In 2010, Russia once again defeated Brazil in a 5th-set tie-breaker.\nIn 2014, the United States made it to the finals after an astonishing straight-set win against the 2012 Olympic champion and 2006 and 2010 runner-up Brazil. China, on the other hand, reached the championship after winning over hosts Italy in a four-set fashion. The finals saw two former World champions – Lang Ping and Karch Kiraly – at the helm of the champion squads. United States' momentum carried them to a 3–1 victory over the young Chinese squad, earning the first ever World title for the USA women's team after finishing as bridesmaids in several editions of the World Championship, World Cup and the Olympic Games.\nIn 2018, Serbia achieved historical victory after defeating Italy in a 5th-set tie-breaker. It became greatest international success for the short history of this national team. In 2022, Serbia retained their title after winning all 12 matches at the tournament including a 3–0 victory over Brazil in the final match.\nAs of 2022, 19 editions of the women's Volleyball World Championship have been played: 10 went to European teams, five to Asian teams (three times to Japan and two times to China), and four to American teams (three times to Cuba and once to United States).\nCompetition formula.\nFinal tournament.\nThe competition formula of the FIVB World Championship has been constantly changed to fit the different number of teams that participate in each edition.

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team embarked on a tour of India in 1983–84 following their surprise defeat to India in 1983 World Cup. Captained by Clive Lloyd, the West Indies played six Test matches against India as well as five ODI in addition to other first class matches. The series also known as Revenge Series ended with West Indies winning three tests and winning all the five ODIs. The series displayed Indian batsmen struggling to play against the West Indies pace attack. In most of the matches India lost about 4-5 wickets even before reaching 50 runs. The disastrous 3-0 loss was the widest ever margin of defeat on home soil. Despite the poor performance of Indian players, India did manage to create some records in this series. Kapil Dev produced his career best innings spell in this series of 9 wickets in an innings for 83 runs and Gavaskar scored his career best 236 not out in this series. This knock of 236 runs not out took him past Donald Bradman's record of 29 test hundreds and Vinoo Mankad's record score of 231.\nThere were various other highlights in these series. In the 5th Test, the crowds upset with India's poor performance blamed Sunil Gavaskar and he was pelted with stones and rotten fruits. The first ODI of this series played at Srinagar was the first ever international match played there. The host team was constantly booed by a section of the crowd. There were protests by separatists who dug up the pitch during the lunch break. This series saw debuts by Richie Richardson, Roger Harper, Chetan Sharma, Navjot Sidhu and Raju Kulkarni. Andy Roberts and Yashpal Sharma went into retirement after playing their last matches in this series. The third Test at Gujarat Stadium in Ahmedabad was the first test match ever played on this ground. After the sixth Test, total wickets taken by Malcolm Marshall was 33 wickets which equalled the West Indian record for most wickets in a series. In the same Test, Winston Davis was struck by a missile thrown by a spectator which led to captain Clive Lloyd pulling out his team back to pavilion. The match was resumed only after Lloyd received assurances from the state Governor that security would be increased.\nTest matches.\nThird Test.\nIn the Indian second innings, six batsman scored just one run each.\nODIs.\nThe West Indies won the Charminar Challenge Cup 5-0."

Maggona is about 10 kilometres south of Kalutara.\nHistory.\nAfter the 2004 tsunami the Surrey County Cricket Club in England and the Sri Lanka Cricket Board combined to raise money to build a village for some of the Sri Lankan survivors. A Twenty20 match played by international cricketers at Surrey's home ground, The Oval, on 20 June 2005, raised about a million pounds for the project. An area was cleared of forest, and a village, called Surrey Village, was laid out with streets named after Surrey cricketers. Then the cricket ground was constructed.\nThe ground was officially opened in May 2011. Since then matches in various Sri Lankan domestic men's, women's and junior competitions have been played there, as well as matches by touring clubs from overseas.\nThe first first-class match was between Badureliya Sports Club, who have made this their home ground, and Moors Sports Club in February 2012. The first List A match was between Ragama Cricket Club and Sri Lanka Air Force Sports Club in December 2013.\nThe highest individual score at the ground is 342 by Minod Bhanuka for Sinhalese Sports Club against Badureliya Sports Club in January 2016. The best bowling figures are 9 for 86 by Lasith Embuldeniya for Nondescripts against Saracens Sports Club in March 2020.\nAs of late November 2023, 65 first-class matches and 57 List A matches have been played at Surrey Village."

        "text": "The 2017 World Snooker Championship (officially the 2017 Betfred World Snooker Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 15 April to 1 May 2017 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. It was the 19th and final ranking event of the 2016–17 season which followed the China Open. It was the 41st consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship had been held at the Crucible.\nThe winner of the event was the defending champion and world number one Mark Selby, who defeated John Higgins 18–15 in the final. Selby won despite having fallen 4–10 behind in the second session of the match. Selby defeated Ding Junhui 17–15 in the semi-finals whilst Higgins defeated Barry Hawkins 17–8 to reach the final. This was Selby's third World Championship win; he had also won the tournament in the 2014 and 2016 tournaments.\nThe total prize fund for the championship was £1,750,000, the winner receiving the top prize of £375,000. There were 74 century breaks in the main stage of the championship, and a further 84 in qualifying. Englishman Ronnie O'Sullivan compiled a of 146 in the quarter-finals, the highest of the tournament. Gary Wilson scored a maximum break of 147 in qualifying during his first round win over Josh Boileau. The tournament was broadcast in Europe by the BBC and Eurosport, and internationally by World Snooker on Facebook.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the sport was popular in Great Britain. In modern times it has been played worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nThe 2017 tournament featured 32 professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches played over several , using a single elimination format. The 32 players were selected for the event through a mix of the snooker world rankings, and a pre-tournament qualification competition. The first world championship in 1927 was won by Joe Davis, the final being held in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. , Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O’Sullivan are the event's most successful participants in the modern era, having both won the championship seven times. Mark Selby had won the previous year's championship by defeating China's Ding Junhui in the final 18–14. This was Selby's second world title, having also won the championship in 2014. The event was organised by World Snooker, a subsidiary of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, and sponsored by sports betting company Betfred.\nFormat.\nThe 2017 World Snooker Championship took place between 15 April and 1 May 2017 in Sheffield, England. The tournament was the last of 19 ranking events in the 2016–17 snooker season on the World Snooker Tour. It featured a 32-player main draw that was held at the Crucible Theatre, as well as a 128-player qualifying draw that was played at the English Institute of Sport, Sheffield, from 5 to 12 April, concluding three days before the start of the main draw. This was the 41st consecutive year that the tournament had been staged at the Crucible, and it was the 49th successive world championship to be contested using the modern knockout format.\nThe top 16 players in the latest world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. Mark Selby was seeded first overall as the defending champion, and the remaining 15 seeds were allocated based on the world rankings released after the China Open. The number of frames required to win a match increased with each proceeding round of the main draw, the first round consisting of best-of-19 frames matches, the final match being played over a maximum of 35 frames.\nAll 16 non-seeded spots in the main draw were filled with players from the qualifying rounds. The draw for the qualifying competition consisted of 128 players, including 110 of the remaining 112 players on the World Snooker Tour, as well as 18 wildcard places assigned to non-tour players. These invited players included the women's world champion and the European junior champion. Half of the participants in the qualifying draw were seeded players: those ranked from 17th to 80th were allocated one of 64 seeds in world ranking order; the other participants were placed randomly into the draw. To reach the main draw at the Crucible, players were required to win three best-of-19 frames qualifying matches.\nPrize fund.\nThe total prize money for the event was raised to £1,750,000 from the previous year's prize fund of £1,500,100. The winner of the event won £375,000. A breakdown of prize money for the 2017 World Snooker Championship is shown below.\nThe \"rolling 147 prize\" awarded for a maximum break was £5,000, which was won by Gary Wilson in qualifying.\nCoverage.\nThe 2017 World Snooker Championship was broadcast throughout Europe by both BBC TV and Eurosport. The tournament was streamed internationally on Facebook for the first time, specifically for portions of South America and Asia. The event was also broadcast in North America on Facebook, and the final was aired on the Eleven Sports Network.\nTournament summary.\nSeeding and qualifying rounds.\nThe top 16 ranked players in the world automatically qualified as seeds for the first round of the main stage at the Crucible. Defending champion Mark Selby was seeded first and the other 15 seeding allocations were based on the latest world rankings from after the China Open. The players ranked from 17th position entered the competition in the first round of qualifying and were required to win three best-of-19 frames matches to qualify for the main tournament. The three qualifying rounds were held at the Ponds Forge International Sports Centre in Sheffield from 5 to 12 April 2017.\nTwo-time world champion Mark Williams took part in qualifying, having failed to regain his place in the top 16. He lost 7–10 to Stuart Carrington in his third qualifying match and missed the knockout stage for only the second time since 1996. Williams qualified at the following year's event, where he defeated John Higgins 18–16 in the final to win his third world title.\nThe deciding frame of the third-round qualifying match between Fergal O'Brien and David Gilbert on 12 April was the longest frame on record in the modern era of the game; lasting for 123 minutes and 41 seconds, it broke the previous record of 100 minutes and 24 seconds set by Alan McManus and Barry Pinches in 2015. Gary Wilson made the 131st officially recognised maximum break, the second of his career, in the fourth frame of his first-round qualifying match against Josh Boileau on 6 April. Wilson was one of five players to qualify for the main stage of the championship at the Crucible for the first time, the other four debutants being David Grace, Noppon Saengkham, Yan Bingtao, and Zhou Yuelong. The draw for the first round of the main competition took place at 10:00 a.m. BST on 13 April 2017.\nFirst round.\nThe first round of the championship took place between 15 and 20 April 2017. All matches were played as best-of-19 frames held over two sessions. Having been eliminated in the first round at the Crucible in the four years since his 2012 semi-final appearance, Stephen Maguire defeated fellow Scot Anthony McGill to progress to the second round for the first time in five years. In his 25th consecutive appearance at the World Championship, Ronnie O'Sullivan withstood a fightback from qualifier Gary Wilson—who had recovered from down to down—to win their first round match . In doing so, O'Sullivan secured a place in the last 16 for the 14th year in a row, equalling the record set by Terry Griffiths in 1996.\nElsewhere, Marco Fu trailed Luca Brecel 0–5, 1–7 and 4–8 before winning 10–9 in the first round. Third seed Stuart Bingham played 2002 world champion Peter Ebdon, who was appearing at the Crucible for the 24th time since first qualifying in 1992. Ebdon won the final frame of the first session despite needing 15 points from with just the colours remaining; he achieved the three snookers needed, and potted the respotted black to bring the score to 4–5. He won just one more frame before losing 5–10 to Bingham.\nQualifier Rory McLeod defeated second seed Judd Trump 10–8 after trailing 0–4. Before the tournament Trump had declared that he \"honestly believe [he] can play to a standard which is very rare nowadays,\" and that he was \"the best\" in the world. His poor performance in the match, which ran into a third session, was exacerbated by a shoulder injury that was causing him visible pain when down on shots. This resulted in 46-year-old McLeod becoming the oldest player to reach the last 16 since Steve Davis' quarter-final run in 2010 aged 52. McLeod commented that his victory was \"the best win of [his] career, to beat Judd Trump on centre stage is brilliant.\"\nIn an all-Chinese match, fourth seed Ding Junhui defeated debutant Zhou Yuelong 10–5 to reach the last 16. Ali Carter lost 7–10 in a tense encounter with 2006 world champion Graeme Dott, which Carter blamed on his poor start to the match. The 2010 world champion Neil Robertson made his 500th career century during his 10–4 first round win over Noppon Saengkham. In his first-round loss to Liang Wenbo, Stuart Carrington became only the fifth player, after John Higgins, Ronnie O'Sullivan, Mark Selby, and Neil Robertson, to make century breaks in three consecutive frames in a World Championship match; Liang won the match 10–7. Xiao Guodong defeated Wales' sole representative Ryan Day 10–4, which Day referred to as \"embarrassing\". This was the first event since 1969 where the second round contained no Welsh players.\nSeven former world champions progressed to the second round: Selby, Bingham, O'Sullivan, Higgins, Robertson, Dott and Shaun Murphy. Ebdon was the only former champion in the main draw not to reach the last 16. None of the five debutants made it to the second round.\nSecond round.\nThe second round of the championship took place from 20 to 24 April 2017, matches being played as best-of-25 frames over three sessions. At this stage, 12 of the 16 seeded players remained in the competition. Kyren Wilson advanced to his second consecutive World Championship quarter-final by defeating third seed Stuart Bingham 13–10. Five-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan beat Shaun Murphy 13–7, to set up his 18th quarter-final appearance at the Crucible. Having dispatched Zhou Yuelong in the first round, Ding Junhui played in a second consecutive all-Chinese match, defeating fellow countryman Liang Wenbo 13–12.\nFour-time world champion John Higgins defeated Mark Allen 13–9, having trailed 3–5 after the first session. Stephen Maguire defeated Rory McLeod 13–3 with a session to spare to reach his first World Championship quarter-final since 2012. Maguire was the only unseeded player to progress to the quarter-finals. Defending champion Mark Selby defeated Xiao Guodong 13–6, commenting afterwards, \"I don't feel as though I have peaked\". Marco Fu won 13–11, after his opponent Neil Robertson missed the final black in the 24th frame which would have sent their match into a deciding frame.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 25 and 26 April 2017, as best-of-25 frames matches divided over three sessions. John Higgins won all three sessions of his match against Kyren Wilson and triumphed 13–6, to advance to his first semi-final since winning the event in 2011. With the score tied at 3–3 in the first session, Wilson miscued and split his cue tip, requiring a 15-minute break to carry out the repair. The two players would meet in the semi-finals of the following year's tournament, which Higgins won 17–13.\nDefending champion Mark Selby defeated Marco Fu 13–3 with a session to spare. Selby's victory included a break of 143 in frame 15, which BBC commentator Stephen Hendry described as \"one of the best [breaks] I've ever seen.\" After the match, Fu commented that Selby was \"unplayable at times\" and predicted that he would win the championship.\nDing Junhui defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan 13–10 in their quarter-final encounter. Ding developed an early 3–0 lead, but O'Sullivan fought back to level the first session at 4–4. Ding dominated the second session and opened up a 10–6 overnight lead. O'Sullivan took the first two frames of the final session to reduce his deficit to 8–10; the next four frames were shared equally, before Ding concluded the match in frame 23. O'Sullivan attempted a 147 maximum break in frame 20, but he ran out of position after potting the 13th red and was forced to take the pink instead of the black; his consequent of 146 was the highest break of the championship.\nStephen Maguire was defeated 9–13 by Barry Hawkins, who reached his fourth Crucible semi-final in five years. Hawkins led 9–7 after the first two sessions, but Maguire took the next two frames—including a 135 clearance in frame 17—to tie the match at 9–9. Hawkins then won the next four frames straight to round out the match.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals, which took place from 27 to 29 April 2017, were played as best-of-33 frames matches divided over four sessions. A single table was used for both matches, successive sessions of play alternating between the two semi-finals. Defending champion Mark Selby played fourth seed Ding Junhui in the first semi-final, which was a rematch of the previous year's final. Selby held the lead for most of the match, before Ding drew level at 12–12 after three sessions. Selby then won four of the next five frames, to lead 16–13, requiring just one more frame to win the match. Ding persevered to win two further frames, before Selby scored a break of 72 to triumph 17–15.\nSixth seed John Higgins played seventh seed Barry Hawkins in the other semi-final. Higgins held the lead after each of the first three sessions, at 5–3, 10–6, and 16–8, before winning the match 17–8 in the first frame of the final session. World Snooker described his semi-final win as a \"demolition\". With the victory, Higgins qualified for his first World Championship final in six years and his sixth overall, the first being 19 years previously when he won his first world title in 1998.\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 30 April and 1 May 2017 between first seed Mark Selby and sixth seed John Higgins. It was a best-of-35 frames match, spread over four sessions. This final was a rematch of the 2007 World Championship final, where Higgins had defeated Selby 18–13. In reaching the 2017 final, Higgins became the second-oldest Crucible world finalist at 41 years and 11 months, behind Ray Reardon who had played in the 1982 final aged 49. The other quadragenarians to have played in a world final at the Crucible were John Spencer and Terry Griffiths.\nHiggins led 6–2 after the first session and 10–4 during the second, before finishing the first day 10–7 ahead. Selby fought back on the second day to win six of the first seven frames, and he was leading 13–11 by the end of the third session. The next six frames were shared equally and Selby maintained his two-frame lead at 16–14. In frame 31, he played a shot to roll up to the ; despite his conviction that he had made contact, Selby was told by referee Jan Verhaas that he had the ball, for which he received a seven-point penalty. Higgins then won the frame to take the score to 16–15. After compiling a 131 break in frame 32, Selby won the championship with a break of 75 in frame 33, bringing the final match score to 18–15.\nSelby had achieved his victory after falling behind by six frames at the end of the first day's play. He became the fourth player (after Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry, and Ronnie O'Sullivan) to defend the world title in the Crucible era. He also became the third player (after Hendry and Ding Junhui) to win five full ranking titles in a single season, the first player to win the China Open and the world title back-to-back, and the first player to win over £1,000,000 across the two-year rolling prize money list.

        "text": "Immortals is a professional esports organization based in the United States owned by Immortals Gaming Club. It was founded on October 7, 2015, after the acquisition of Team 8's LCS spot.\nImmortals applied for a franchise partnership with the LCS when the league began franchising in late 2017, but their application was declined by Riot Games due to financial concerns, despite the fact that they were one of three North American teams to qualify for the 2017 World Championship. However, in mid-2019 they rejoined the LCS after their parent company, Immortals Gaming Club, bought out OpTic Gaming and their LCS spot.\nImmortals previously competed in other esports titles, including \"Apex Legends\", \"Arena of Valor\", \"Clash Royale\", \"\", \"Dota 2\", \"Overwatch\", \"Rainbow Six Siege\", \"Super Smash Bros.\" and \"Vainglory\".\nOwnership.\nImmortals is owned by Immortals Gaming Club, a collective esports and gaming company. Other than owning the team their name stems from, Immortals Gaming Club owns MIBR and the Los Angeles Valiant Overwatch League team. Investors for the group include Anschutz Entertainment Group, Peter Levin, the president of Lionsgate Interactive Venture and Games, who co-founded Nerdist; Allen Debevoise, former chairman at Machinima.com; Steve Kaplan, a co-owner of the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies; serial entrepreneur Brian Lee, entertainment industry venture capitalists Machine Shop Ventures; Neil Leibman, a co-owner of MLB's Texas Rangers, and others.\n\"League of Legends\".\nOn October 7, 2015, it was announced that a new esports organization called Immortals had acquired Team 8's spot in the North American \"League of Legends\" Championship Series (NA LCS). On October 14, 2015, Dodo8 announced his retirement and moved to a management position in Immortals. On December 8 it was announced that Seong \"Huni\" Hoon Heo, Kim \"Reignover\" Yeu Jin, Eugene \"Pobelter\" Park, Jason \"WildTurtle\" Tran, and Adrian \"Adrian\" Ma would be joining the team's inaugural roster. Of these five players, only Pobelter remained on the 2017 roster. On December 7, 2016, Joshua \"Dardoch\" Hartnett joined as Immortals' starting jungler, signing a three-year contract. Top laner Lee \"Flame\" Ho-jong and bot laner Liyu \"Cody Sun\" Sun joined on December 9, 2016, while support Kim \"Olleh\" Joo-sung was first reported as joining the team on December 12, 2016, with a press release from Immortals officially announcing his signing on the following day.\nFollowing a seventh-place finish in the spring split, Immortals finished second in the summer regular season and advanced all the way to the summer finals, where they were defeated by Team SoloMid. Nonetheless, Immortals qualified for the 2017 World Championship by having the most championship points at the end of the summer split.\nAt the 2017 World Championship, Immortals were placed in Group B of the main event group stage, along with Europe's Fnatic, South Korea's Longzhu Gaming and Vietnam's GIGABYTE Marines. After losing to Fnatic in the second round robin and one of two subsequent tiebreaker matches, Immortals and knocked them out of the tournament. After failing to secure a spot in the newly franchised LCS, Immortals disbanded on November 20, 2017.\nIn June 2019, Immortals announced that they had rejoined the LCS after their parent company, Immortals Gaming Club, bought out OpTic Gaming and their LCS spot.\nIn January 2022, Immortals announced a multi-year naming rights partnership with the Progressive Corporation, renaming their LCS team to Immortals Progressive.\n\"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\".\nImmortals acquired Tempo Storm's fully Brazilian lineup on June 1, 2016. The former coach of SK Gaming, Wilton \"zews\" Prado, replaced Gustavo \"SHOOWTiME\" Gonçalves on July 22, 2016. On June 21, Immortals won DreamHack Summer 2016 after beating Ninjas in Pyjamas 2–0. The team placed 3rd-4th at CyberPowerPC Summer 2016, losing to Cloud9 in the semi-finals. Immortals won Northern Arena 2016 on September 4 after they beat Cloud9 in the finals. After a disappointing showing at ESL Pro League Season 4 Finals in Brazil, Immortals replaced Wilton \"zews\" Prado with former teammate of boltz, Lucas \"steel\" Lopes. The most recent roster change involving the team was when João \"felps\" Vasconcellos was traded to SK Gaming in exchange for Lincoln \"fnx\" Lau. On January 27, 2018, the team investors acquired the MiBR branding, after some months of negotiation with Paulo Velloso (former MiBR CEO), planning to come back with a Brazilian roster in the future.\nTournament results.\nBold denotes a \n\"Super Smash Bros.\".\nImmortals branched into \"Super Smash Bros.\" by signing the \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\" and \"Super Smash Bros.

Melee\" player DaJuan \"Shroomed\" McDaniel, who was previously signed with Winterfox.\n\"Dota 2\".\nOn September 13, 2017, it was announced that Immortals had acquired the North American-based independent Korean squad \"Team Phoenix\" consisting of The International 2016 MVP Phoenix roster.\nOn December 30, 2017, offlaner Forev announced via Twitter his departure from the team.\n\"Clash Royale\".\nImmortals started their Clash Royale team as part of the Clash Royale League North America.

The team revealed their starting roster over a series of Twitter posts from October 30 to November 2, consisting of four DPS, four tanks, and three supports."

        "text": "Ryan Patrick Kelly (born May 30, 1993) is an American football center for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, and was selected by the Colts in first round of the 2016 NFL draft.\nEarly years.\nKelly attended Lakota West High School in West Chester, Ohio, where he was teammates with Jordan Hicks. As a junior in 2009, he was a first team all-conference and all-city selection on the offensive line. During his senior season, he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the last game of his season against rival Lakota East, yet he still was named third-team Division I All-Ohio. Although selected, he was unable to play at the Under Armour All-America Game coming off of his knee injury.\nRated as a three-star recruit by \"ESPN\", Kelly was ranked as the No. 4 center prospect in his class. He collected numerous scholarship offers from major programs, including Alabama, Florida, Florida State, Michigan, and Tennessee, but none from his home-state Ohio State Buckeyes who signed the third-ranked center, Brian Bobek from Palatine, Illinois, instead. Kelly verbally committed to Alabama in July 2010.\nCollege career.\nAfter redshirting his initial year in Tuscaloosa, Kelly came off the bench to play in 10 games of the 2012 season at center, backing up All-American senior Barrett Jones. Kelly was named to the Southeastern Conference (SEC) All-Freshman team, alongside Amari Cooper and T. J. Yeldon. In his sophomore year, Kelly took over starting duties from Jones, making the calls on an offensive line that ranked 23rd nationally and fourth in the SEC for fewest sacks allowed per game (1.31).\nAs a junior, Kelly was named to the Rimington Trophy watch list and started 12 games at center. A highly reliable anchor on the offensive line, he missed just seven assignments in 806 snaps on the year for a 99.1 percent success rate and did not allow a quarterback sack. After wins at Tennessee and against Western Carolina he was named Alabama's Offensive Player of the Week. In his senior season, Kelly missed only eight assignments in 1,012 snaps for a success rate of 99.2 percent on the season, and committed just one penalty in 1,012 snaps with no holding calls. He was a consensus first team All-America selection, earning first-team honors from the Walter Camp Football Foundation, \"USA Today\", \"Sporting News\", the Football Writers Association of America, and the American Football Coaches Association, and won the Rimington Trophy in 2015.\nProfessional career.\nThe Indianapolis Colts selected Kelly in the first round (18th overall) of the 2016 NFL draft. The Colts drafted him with the expectation of him becoming \"the first solid center for the franchise since Jeff Saturday.\" He was Alabama's first interior offensive lineman selected in the first round since Chance Warmack in 2013.\nOn May 4, 2016, the Colts signed Kelly to a fully guaranteed four-year, $10.45 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $5.80. He started all 16 games at center during his rookie year.\nOn August 17, 2017, it was revealed that Kelly would undergo foot surgery for a broken bone he suffered during practice. He missed the first four weeks of the season, and went on to start the next seven games. He suffered a concussion in Week 12 and missed the next three games before being placed on injured reserve on December 18, 2017.\nOn April 27, 2019, the Colts picked up the fifth-year option on Kelly's contract.\nOn September 4, 2020, the Colts signed Kelly to a four-year, $50 million extension, making him the highest paid center in the NFL.\nPersonal life.\nOn December 17, 2021 Kelly and his wife Emma lost their newborn daughter due to a heart failure."

It is headquartered in New Delhi, India.\nHistory.\nIn 2015, IPBA - Indian Professional Boxing Association was formed in Delhi. Mr. Shahe Ali, President of the Indian Professional Boxing Association, led the efforts towards its formation. With the establishment of IPBA, a strong attempt has been made to bring back attention to the sport.\nIPBA is a 'Not for Profit’ organization registered as a Section 8 Company with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India. The aim and endeavours of IPBA are geared towards bringing the sport of boxing in India at par with other popular sports.\nOverview.\nIn India, boxing does not have a large fan base, which is often attributed to the lack of discernible international exposure. However, despite Indian limited success in global championships events, athletes have regularly won medals at the Asian and Commonwealth Games. Since the first national boxing championship in 1950, India has not until 2015 established any platform for professional boxers. After a long wait of 65 Years, India is stepping into Professional Boxing.\nA key desire of IPBA is to make the transition of Indian athletes from amateur boxing to the world of professional boxing a smooth affair. IPBA would also manage and promote professional boxing at national level in India and would ensure Indian professionals make their presence felt at the international level as well. IPBA wants the world to see India as a premier breeding ground of power sports in the world of sports.\nAffiliations.\nThe Indian Professional Boxing Association is affiliated and member organization of the World Boxing Association, World Boxing Organization, International Boxing Federation, Association of Professional Boxing Commissions, Eurasian Boxing Parliament and WBA Asia Boxing Association.

It was contested by French side Racing 92, and Saracens of England, at the Grand Stade de Lyon, in the Lyon suburb of Décines, France, on Saturday 14 May 2016.\nSaracens defeated Racing 92 by 21 points to 9. This was Saracens first European Cup win, making them the first new champions since Toulon, whose first victory in what was then known as the Heineken Cup came in 2013.\nBackground.\nPrior to the draw for the 2015–16 tournament, it was announced that Lyon would host the 2015–16 European Rugby Challenge Cup and Champions Cup finals at the newly built Grand Stade de Lyon, while the 2017 finals would be held at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh, Scotland. Two weeks before the match, Nigel Owens was chosen to referee the final. This was Racing's first European Cup final, while Saracens were previously defeated by Toulon in the 2014 Heineken Cup Final. The two teams last met in the tournament the previous season, Saracens having defeated Racing at the quarter-final stage with a last-minute penalty kick.\nRoute to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nRacing 92.\nIn the pool stages, fifth-seeds Racing 92 topped Pool 3, winning four of six games. Their first match with Glasgow Warriors was postponed for two months due to the November 2015 Paris attacks, but they went on to win their first two fixtures. After drawing 9-9 with Northampton Saints and winning the postponed match 34-10, Racing inflicted a heavy 64-14 away defeat on the Scarlets. Racing lost their final match 22-5 away at against the Warriors, which was relocated from Scotstoun Stadium to Rugby Park due to heavy rainfall.\nOn April 10 in the quarter-finals, Racing hosted Toulon at Stade Yves-du-Manoir and narrowly won by 19-16. Two weeks later, they won in the semi-finals by the same scoreline Leicester Tigers at City Ground in Nottingham, England.\nSaracens.\nSeeded first, Saracens won Pool 1 after winning all six of their matches. In the quarter-finals, they won 29-20 against the Northampton Saints at Allianz Park on 9 April, with tries from Chris Ashton and Chris Wyles. Both were converted by Owen Farrell, who also scored all five of their penalties. Two weeks later, they won their semi-final 24-17 against Wasps at the Madejski Stadium in Reading, England.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe game was played mostly during a heavy rain storm, and featured no tries. Racing 92's scrum-half Maxime Machenaud missed an early penalty kick, allowing Saracens fly-half Owen Farrell to score first, hitting a drop goal from close range to give the Saracens a 3–0 lead. After winning a scrum deep in the Saracens half, Racing's outside-centre Johan Goosen drew the score level 3–3 at 17 minutes. Machenaud was removed from play under concussion regulations on 22 minutes. Farrell scored on a two successive penalties to make the score 9–3 in Saracens' favour. Just before the end of the half, Goosen and Farrell traded penalties to make the score 12–6.\nRacing's fly-half, Dan Carter was substituted shortly after half-time, having aggravated his leg injury. Farrell scored another penalty early in the second half to extend the lead to 15–6. As Racing became more aggressive following the 60 minute mark, Goosen scored his third penalty of the game to bring the score to 15–9. Farrell would preserve the lead for Saracens, by scoring two more penalties; once in the 76th minute, and once in the 79th minute for a final score of 21–9 in favour of Saracens.\nMaro Itoje was named Man of The Match, and also received the European Player of the Year award. Saracens became the first team to win the competition with a 100 per cent win rate across all of their matches."
